["Vitamin K1 Fellow hemophiliacs, do you guys supplement with vitamin K1? If so, have you been able to notice any differences with less bleeds or less severe bleeds? We have not been supplementing for my son but I did ask our HTC early in his life.\nBecause Vit K is not part of his deficiency they said it would not be beneficial.\nBiggest thing we found for bleed prevention was newest long acting products (Rebinyn now) and keeping levels above 5% (his trough is 15% now after 7 days). Okay great, thank you! I appreciate your input! Hi im 19 years old hemophilia A mild i am in pain right now actually vitamins for the bones and vegetables is the best way to recover from a bleeding episode based on my experiences cause factor 8 in asia is expensive third world countries cannot afford it unless you are in a rich family tho. And also Vitamin E is bad for hemophiliacs because it can thin out blood. Hey! \nThe vitamin K dependant factors are II, VII, IX and X... \n\nSo unless you are deficient anyway (and HTC would pick that up because changes different parts of clotting tests), taking supplements will not make a difference... \n\n(Am a Pharmacist with VWD!) Okay thank you! Wow! This was explained better than any doctor has. \n\nSo if I understand correctly, someone with Hemophilia A (a factor VIII deficiency) would not see any benefits at all from Vitamin K ? Not immune, just not really any additional benefit from taking a supplement. You would just pee it out as you body automatically regulates what you do and do not need.  I just eat alot of Kiwi. It is a great fruit", "Preparing for Retirement I know its a long ways away, but the topic has come up in the office. \n\nAt age 60, we can retire and receive 50% of our income based on the average of our three highest paid years. Kind of crappy. The kick in the teeth is that our benefits seize. \n\nI understand this is three decades away and whole new system will probably be implemented. However, as of right now I am really concerned what is going to happen when it comes time to order my meds and I no longer have benefits. \n\nThanks for reading. I do not think it is worth the time to worry about this now.  I expect that your treatment options will be radically different by then, if not not in the next 10 years.  I hope that it will not even be something you will have to think about by that time because of gene therapy or some other long-lasting treatment.\n\nI think your time would be better spent working on other aspects of your health, such as diet and exercise (as much as you can), so that you can help minimize your health care expenses in your later years. I hear yea. I have always been a prepper of sorts. I wake up at 5am and already have dinner set to go. I cannot help myself. I navigated the country with a pickup truck camper for two weeks, and had the entire route planned out. We arrived at each destination within the hour. =D\n\nJust something that floats around the office now and then. \n\nFunny you mention the exercise and health. I have lost 18lbs in three weeks by watching what I eat. Never felt better.  Just keep it up...for 30 more years :) It is difficult to make predictions, especially about future :) . One of the most famous economists Paul Samuelson \"predicted\" in 1960s that Soviet Union's GNP will surpass that of USA by the late 1990s. \n\nI am not sure how pension system works in the USA, but in Europe it is one big Ponzi scheme (pay as you go). When it was introduced in my country (maybe 60 years ago), we had 5 workers : 1 retired man. It was easy for these 5 workers to pay for that retired guy's pension. Today in my country the ratio is 1:1 - country of 4 million people have 1.5 million retired people. It is insane. Enormous part of budget is spent on pensions. \n\nMost of these systems will fail or people will be forced to work until they die. It will be really hard for those who do not have families.\n\nI am approaching 30, studied language and philosophy and with no chance for employment (you need brutal connections to end up teaching in schools - like having a father who is principal). I am not even in position to earn for my retirement at the moment. \n\nWe can assume that by the 2025. there will be big advances in Hemophilia care (gene therapy) and maybe we will progress from severe to mild hemophilia, so that will not be an issue. I think we should find a way to earn some passive income, I live in Croatia which heavily relies on tourism, so If there is a chance for me to rip off tourists during 3 summer months, I could live through the rest of the year. Many people do that. \n\nIf you have low time preference and education that is worth on the market, you should not be afraid of the future.   ", "Val Bias longtime CEO of NHF has passed away.

I am worried my doctor is not taking my bleeding disorder seriously. How do I confirm he will follow my hematologist's plan? Hello! I am having surgery in a week and every time I have mentioned my bleeding disorder, I have felt a little brushed off. My hematologist sent him a message informing him of what the plan should be to address my bleeding. How do I confirm he plans to follow it? First, find out from your hematologist what the plan is.  Second, ask your surgeon how he intends to address your disorder during surgery.  (Not an unreasonable request).  Third, decide, based on the surgeons response, if this is the right doctor for you.  You can cancel surgery at any time.  It is your prerogative.  Also, before surgery tell EVERY medical person who comes to care for you that you are a hemophiliac and need special handling.  Good luck with the surgery. Thanks for your response! I met with my hematologist a couple of weeks ago, so I know the plan. It is always the same plan, I just wanted something in writing from her since I felt like I was being brushed off. \n\nI will send him a message in the morning. Thanks for the advice! Advocate! I found that as someone who is mild, my docs (even my hematologist) think I do not need too much treatment. This led to my last surgery essentially failing due to persistent bleeding not allowing the incisions to heal quickly enough. Find out the plan from your hematologist and shout it to the rooftops of anyone who will be involved in your surgery. \n\nIf you can do your own research on academic articles of the type of surgery you are having and hemophilia treatment for that surgery, that could help too. I have had to do a lot more research and treatment suggestion than I would have thought to make sure people take my \u201cmild\u201d disorder seriously. My aunt (symptomatic carrier) has had the same experience. You are always your best advocate. The plans need to be laid out clearly and followed to the letter according to your hematologist guidelines and your needs. Your surgeon should have a direct line to the hematologist depending on the severity of the surgery. (Small stuff short of life threatening or emergency complications may not be as much of an issue of course).\n\nAs much as we would all like to have a universal answer to every situation, the fact is every single hemophiliac has different needs based on things like half-life and other underlying complications that can occur on an individual basis.\n\nAs always it is good to have extra factor on hand in case of unforseen complications, and also share your concerns with your hematologist until you are both comfortable with the plans before, during, and after the operation.\n\nHope all goes well!

If I am not happy with his response, I will respond accordingly.\n\nThanks for your support! \ud83d\udc9c My doctors in India did an amazing job. \n\nHere is the full story:\n\nI was planned to be operated at 11Am morning. A nurse comes in at 7-8am and proceeds to administer Factor VIII. I asked him what the protocols are for a patient with hemophilia(they all knew i was hemophilic, i just wanted to know what they were going to do one last time)\n\nHe explains that after this factor is infused they will be back in an hour to get a sample of my blood to check for factor activity levels, he also stressed that inorder to proceed with the surgery I must have 80%+ lvl of factors.\n\nThank god the results came as 81% and they wheeled me in. I was then put on anesthetic.\n\nAfter the surgery was done, surgeon came and told me that even with 80% lvl of factor i had a heavy bleeding. Thankfully everything else went ok. After that they administered factor with 12 hours interval for 8-9DAYS!!!! I was a scrawny 35-40KG kid back then probably. They started with 1000IU for the first day, by third day they lowered it to 750iu, as the 6th day came around I was put on 250iu, and by the 9th day I wass off the factors. Remember this is INDIA and they had not enough factors to keep me in prophy regimen, even though it was a major knee surgery\n\nFirst ask your Hematologist about the paln he sent, and then be sure to ask your surgeon what he is going to do takle the problem of bleedings. If the details doesnt match, I suggest you find a new surgeon. Absolutely - They do loads of research of factor use in surgery - if you know what your plan is then you can make sure you are getting the right doses when you need them! \nTo some extent it is actually good that the surgeon is not bothered - they must be confident in the plan you haematologist has sent them. Mostly surgeons are a bit obsessed with bleeding - makes surgery harder! My current doctors will not do anything amounting to a \"procedure\" without first contacting and clearing it with my HTC.\n\nFirst, always use a Board certified doctor, and make sure that the board that certified them has a good reputation. You can literally just ask where they were board certified. They should tell you.  (This is important down below.) Get the specifics of your operation from your doctor and then consult your hematologist. And I do mean be honest about your intentions. Ask plainly, \"I would like the specifics of this operation so that I can consult my hematologist. In plain English but also specific medical terms as well if possible.\" You as the patient have every right to know what is going on. You also have the right to consults and second opinions. If they give you any significant problems or create any major hurdles to you being educated and reassured about your own body and health report them to the board that certified them. Continue to advocate! Milds need treatment too! It took me years to get proper treatment.\n\nInteresting side note: 20% of milds and 40% of moderates in the USA bleed so much they need prophy. If you are in America, lawsuit over malpractice? I am somewhere where lawsuits of this nature are unheard of, and unless I am warded in the haematology ward instead of the surgical ward, factor infusion is always screwed up for surgeries. They take the infusion time table as a joke and just leave the factor sitting there and it is always hours after the scheduled time that the infusion is administered. But wait, are not you a haemophiliac? Do not you know how to administer it? They will not let you do so. None of their nurses are allowed to do so. Only their on call doctor is authorised to.

But that is very rare for me.  Does this happen to you in every vein or just a certain one? So far it is been both of the two veins I have used for several years Yea I have experienced this before too. The brand of Saline and other supplies can totally change the \u201cfeel\u201d of your infusion. But I will assume you have not changed anything supply wise, as I assume if you like changed needle gauge you would of said lol. So if you have the same gauge and syringe brand, really the only options are biological. I am not sure how much HPB would change the feel and reflux of the syringe. I imagine it would have to be a large increase in your BP to have a noticeable change, but as always talk to your doctor if you notice other changes regarding your BP or symptoms of HBP. I also do not think room temperature would have an effect either. \n\nThe other thing I can think of is not that it is springing back, but actually providing resistance, which compared to your usual ease of infusion, might feel like push back. That could be caused by mechanical changes to your veins. My one hand vein is trash, and hard to actually hit these days. So sometimes when I get it, it is not the best infusion; difficult to infuse etc. Weakness in the vein walls could change their shape and cause the actual lumen to get pushed against the vein, causing resistance. If that resistance goes away when adjusting the needle, then it is a positional issue. That is the most likely culprit in my opinion. Interesting! Thank you very much for the reply. I have been doing my own \u201cexperiments\u201d per se - I usually shower right before I factor so today I waited a bit and did not notice a big difference. I will definitely update my post after talking to the doc! You can tell if you hit an artery because artery\u2019s have a pulse, so the needle will be bopping up and down to your heart beat. Also , if it is in your hand or lower arm, your hand will swell and be in excruciating pain within seconds of pushing anything into it. \nPoint being you will know if you have hit an artery. If you do take it out right away and hold pressure on it for a while. \nI have had a hard time pushing factor in before but I always figured there was a clot in the needle or maybe the needle was up agains a vein wall or something. As long as you are able to get the factor in you I would not worry too much. It could be a different batch of syringes too maybe? Yep the blood return was pulsing and bright red when it happened to me.  It was in my upper arm above my elbow.  It bruised a bit after but not a ton.  I do use teeny needles so that may be why it was able to go in.  \n\nGood point about the different syringe, I find some syringe brands easier to push than others. Great question... I get that pushback sometimes too and wondered what may cause it Exactly what u/Cptabimal69 is 99% the cause of the feeling you have been having.

I just needed to out it out there. It is been weighing on me. So are you now on prophy?  How many bleeds did you have per month prior to going on prophy?

Honestly not sure. My ankles were bad. Apparently much worse than I had let myself believe. Hence my statement about denial. I would say I was having some small bleeding every few weeks. And I just babied them. Enough that it went beyond lifestyle adjustments. I could hardly walk and I just kept telling myself it was ligament and tendon damage. I was not very smart about it. That is for sure. But I am trying to be better. Does your treatment center participate in the ( They do. But I have insurance and the HTC's pharmacy is out of network. My concern is not with my own out of pocket. The insurance covered all of the cost. But the district pays the expenses. The district is self paying. Which means, like an insurance company itself the money's taken in by the district from premiums and copays has to cover the cost of all of the districts medical expenses each year.  The full cost of which will go up substantially by my medication and care. It does not cost me any more than my premiums out of pocket. I even qualified for copay relief on the factor from Bayer. So I paid nothing. And I cannot describe how grateful I am for that. I could not have afforded anymore expenses. But I am concerned it will cost everyone in the district during our open enrollment next year. Personally, I think you will be fine and wont see much of an increase overall. If it becomes a problem, I imagine your superiors will talk to you about it to try and get a better understanding. I understand that your concern is the cost to your self-insured employer.  Is there an in-network specialty pharmacy you can use?  I do not have the the exact numbers in front of me, but my uncle's insurance company gets billed ~170k/month, in-network.  The insurance company pays only something like 45 percent of that. There is an in network. And according to the benefits summary I received they had no special pricing on this factor like they do on many other services and medications. It is had me stressed. From what I read the insurance was billed 120k+ and paid all of it except for the 450 co-pay I was supposed to pay that Bayer covered. That is specifically what I am worried about. Retaliation or resentment from others if they find out. People do not always respond well to things. Lol. I have been on prophy for years and have been on employer insurance at a few workplaces for several years at a time. I have never seen or heard of them increasing the premiums for the company because of me and nobody has ever said a word to my about my condition unless it affected my work or I brought it up. I have worked for large companies, but still. Thank you. This is a rational concern.  It used to be a serious factor in small businesses where a gas station owner would have to make a choice between staying open and providing coverage to Bob's kid.  Sooner or later, Bob would do something that got him fired.\n\nThis caused \"job jail\" where parents would have to stay in some crap job that had good insurance and even though they had opportunities for advancement elsewhere, they had to stay in job jail to keep their kid covered.\n\nLarge employers like yours are often not as affected as they can off load some of the cost on re-insurance.  Some are so big that you are just one of the big users.  \n\nJust take care of your joints and do good work.  Consider the cost of meds and where you get them from.  In a place that has a 340B program, you may find that it is considerably cheaper to buy product from them than from a drop ship pharmacy.  Changing that could save your school district a fair bit of cash. How coul I afford factor from Gulf States HTC's 340b when it is out of network? Are there other ways to deal with that cost? I really have no idea what I am doing here \ud83e\udd23 I would call Gulf States and your insurance.  if your price is better through your in network pharmacy, then stay with it.  If GS can beat the price, the insurance company may be willing to go out of network. That is not a bad idea. Thank you. I have Mild Hemophilia.  I also work in finance for a local government.  A large school district in Texas might have 2,500 plus employees.  Since they have self-insurance (which most large local governments utilize) the costs of medical care are spread among all employees and the employer.  There is no way to say that your medical costs are the sole reason why premiums increase.  There could be a year when five employees receive cancer treatment or other high-cost treatments.  Inflation also plays a role.  The health insurance fund used to administer claims may have lower reserves than what the actuary recommends.\n\nIn other words, you alone are not the reason premiums would go up. Do not place blame on yourself, you are just one tree in the health fund forest. Thank you. I do not course understand that statistically across that many people I would not be the sole reason. But financially speaking a year of profy is... Well it is definitely going to be a significant factor. Lol. If memory serves though the district does have insurance for catastrophic expenses like... For instance...several people having cancer and and a hemophiliac suddenly deciding to get care. I know these things rationally, but not everything that goes on in the human brain is rational. Lol. I do appreciate you putting this into words though. Reminding myself is oddly not as comforting as being reminded from an outside source. Hey there! I am right there with you as a hemo with 13% on prophy. I was worried about the realities to my district but also saw multiple people with cancer, etc.\nWhen we see the costs it is a bit of a shell shock, but we do need treatment.\nLive your life, be healthy give the best service you can to your district and pray that the ACA is not struck down.", "Hemo advocacy music Hi all!\n\nSome of you may know me and be friends with me outside of this group but I wanted to share here in case some have missed it that I have a new song out called Dear Anxious. \n\nIt is a song that reflects on my journey to becoming a Hemo advocate in my own right and if I get enough streams on it Spotify will create a radio station based on it as well as including it in other radio stations for further reach.  \n\nIt would mean the world to me if those with Spotify would give it a listen if they have not already and if you do not have Spotify it is available on all other platforms \ud83d\ude0a \ud83e\ude78 \n\n Can you post a link besides Spotify?

But I would like any information anybody may have, it would be extremely helpful.  Thanks!", "Willebrand disease and COVID vaccines Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit! I have been spending time reading posts for so long, but never actually got to posting something. \n\nI have been diagnosed with Von Willebrand Type 1 about 5 years ago. I have had only one small bleeding incident when I was a little, but that has been it. I am on the \"border\" of Type 1 and probably that is why I was not diagnosed for a long time. I have taken Desmopressin one time before I got a wisdom tooth pulled out and luckily there were no issues. \n\n I want to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and knowing that I have WVD, I have started to browse the Internet for any recommendations/advises. I have also an appointment with my hematologist to understand if there are any precautionary measures that I need to take.\n\nI was wondering if there are any members with WVD that have already been vaccinated and if yes with which vaccine? \n\nThank you! I am a young woman with severe hemophilia and I got the second pfizer dose today. I just infused blood clotting factor before each dose and took it easy to make sure my muscle did not bleed\u2014pretty much was hard to move my arm for a few days, was fatigued for 5 days after the first dose, and was a little nauseous and craved berries. Sorry I know I am not a VWD person but I do have a bleeding disorder, so wanted to share! Feel free to ask questions VWD type in limbo, bleeding classified as moderate. I usually do not have any issues with IM vaccines and this was no different. I have received both Pfizer shots without problems. That being said, if you are uncertain, always best to check with your HTC first. Hemophiliac here. Got both doses of Pfizer vaccine. \n\n1st dose: arm pain for a day and then totally fine\n\n2nd dose: not a single symptom, felt great and now fully protected. VWD. Got the moderna vaccine. I had all the regular side effects but nothing bleeding related. When I got the vaccine, I told them I have VWD and they made me wait 30 minutes after the vaccine to make sure there was no bleeding at the injection site but there were no issues either time. The WFH produced guidelines! \nBasically you will be fine - maybe take some tranexamic acid after the vaccine doses but with such mild symptoms you should have not a problem! \n\nI have severe VWD and have been told I should give myself a dose of factor before the vaccinations but that I should definitely have them! Our VWD symptoms are nearly identical. Type 1, mild. Take Desmopressin for procedures. I got one dose of Moderna last monday and my only side effect was a sore arm. Hope this helps clear up any anxiety. Very similar here too....mild on the border VWD Type 1 and received first dose of Pfizer on Saturday. Without taking any meds prior I barely bled at the injection site.... did not even need a bandaid! This is unheard of for me and I usually bleed for a while after a flu shot. \n\nThat being said I am having some moderate side effects, but nothing out of the ordinary that I can attribute to VWD. Mainly sore arm, fever, chills, fatigue, and joint pain. The fever and chills started about 3-4 hours after and were gone about 24 hours after the shot, but I am still dealing with everything else 3 days later. I actually just talked to my hematologist and her assistant at my region hemophilia center about the vaccines.  Her assistant actually does COVID-19 vaccinations and said that she has not seen any issues with any of their patients that they have had vaccinated.  I did read something kind of interesting about VWF and COVID-19 that should not give people a false sense of security  but is still interesting.  It is the the Hemophilia Foundation webpage located (  \n\nApparently, cases of COVID-19 have higher than normal VWF histories.  That whole blood thing where people with O seemed to be affected less is thought to possibly be linked to VWF levels as O has less VWF than other blood types.    It kind of makes sense as we all know VWF is a clotting factor and severe COVID often has issues with heavy clotting.   \n Hemophilia Foundation did not hazard a guess as to what this implies but they thought it interesting enough to report as it has really interesting implications. Thanks everyone! This has been incredibly helpful. It is such a relief to hear experiences from people who have been through the vaccination rather than just read reports/statistics.\n\nFor now, AstraZeneca is the only vaccine available in my country, but today they suspended the vaccinations for people under 60. Hoping to get Pfizer or Moderna soon and share my experience! Thanks mine is scheduled tomorrow, eases my mind a bit. Did you dose that day? I did the first time, but the second time I did not. Did not have a problem either way. Congrats on getting the vaccine! Thanks for response appreciate it! I have been diagnosed with acquired VWD. I received the AZ vaccine (first dose) a couple of weeks ago. No issues. Glad to hear that! \ud83d\ude80 Hey! I have recently met an amazing woman and she is told me that she is been living with VWD type 3 her entire life. I am curious to know more (I have done basic research so far) but I am still pretty naive to the disease.  We live in a very small community and our doctors are not the best, so I have been (probably far too optimistically) trying to search for new developments in the disease that might help her.   \n\n\nHave there been any advancements in terms of treatments/cures? Thank you so much for the future response. Hi, \nOk. I can give you an overview. But if you like her - talk to her about it, she will be able to explain what it is like for her. \n\nSo,\n\nCure - no - it is a genetic disorder so complicated to fix until they develop gene therapy! \n\nOtherwise - it is just a part of existence, hopefully she is under the care of a specialist centre (HTC), although this may not be close to you. But when you have grown up with something you get good at managing it. It is not quite like haemophilia but for simplicity it is easier to think of it like that, especially with type 3 as factor 8 levels are usually low. Bleeding does not tend to stop on its own - nosebleeds are a feature, but even minor cuts can be problematic. Joint bleeds can happen but are much less frequent. Obviously any trauma to the body is a big problem so we tend to avoid high risk activities! \n\nTreatment is through injections of the missing von willebrand factor &amp; factor 8, and then tranexamic acid as supportive medication. \n\nThe WFH has a good website and an e-learning centre \n\n", "Belief Biomed's Gene Therapy for Hemophilia B Receives NMPA IND Approval: First Intravenous Infusion Gene Therapy for Rare Disease in China ", "VWD bleeding in early pregnancy Hi, I have VWD type 2A and I am pregnant (6th week). 3 days ago I got hospitalized because I had a bleeding.

I dont take any meds besides magnesium tablets, iron supplements and folic acid. \n\nAre there any women with VWD here who had bleedings during their pregnancy? What were the reasons and how was the bleeding stopped? I would love to hear your experiences! You should discuss factor with your HTC. They should be looking at medications like tranexamic acid, Stimate,  humate-P or alphanate. I am worried with medications - is it safe to take them though I am pregnant? Yes 100% safe.

I literally stay a foot behind him all the way round soft play but did not see this one coming.  Good luck and remember you will not be able to prevent every bleed! Thanks. Yeah I can see that. We are about to become 'frequent flyers' at the hospital as one doctor just put it.  As much as I can understand you watching out that much for him, please start to stay back as soon as he gets more aware of everything around him. He will be fine :)  I know what you are saying. He needs to learn from his own mistakes.  I was once really excited in kindergarten and ran full speed head against a metal bar xD knocked me out for a sec. Severe A. Got up, fancyed my giant bruise that was already forming, parents got called, I got double my medication, others kids got to watch, got to leave for the day and had a doctor check out if I had a concussion. Had to rest a day more, but came back like a unicorn with my bruise that started to color my complete forehead when it started to fade away. This stuff happens, we got medication for it. For a kid it is just as exciting as any other thing, we are not scared about it, only if we are taught to be scared. I later broke my leg in school, that was also something that turned out well. Later even started Kung Fu, full contact, which actually helped my joints more than the doctors and my parents preached...\nMy parents brought me up to be scared and constantly look after myself, be aware of being a bleeder. Had to take therapy later because of struggles in life, on what I can or can not do. All because I was not allowed to play soccer like all my friends did. Keep that in mind :) He will has to learn what his body can do himself. With medication you are as good as everyone else.  Thanks for sharing your story. It is always good as a parent with no prior experience of haemophilia to get as many perspectives as possible. We are actually pretty chilled with him. I followed my 2 year old daughter around soft play too and she does not have a bleeding disorder so I am not treating him differently in that respect. If anything, the challenge for us is other people's attitudes. A few people have said, \"why do you bother letting him do things like that?\". Most people get it when I explain that nowadays with prophylaxis and a HTC only 5 miles down the road we can try as hard as we can to let him experience everything that his peers do.  5.0 miles \u2248 8.0 kilometres ^(1 mile = 1.6km)\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot.

Peoples attitudes have not been a problem for me, usually they do not know anything about hemophilia.

My friends would probably resort to the same joke. Must be a guy thing.  Had a blast on a big festival once. everyone had their medication in the medic tents fridge, so every morning, the 5 bleeder guys, who were complete strangers, would meet there to get their fix. We chatted with the medics, taught a bunch of people what hemophelia is about and they took the chance to ask. We all had a different strain. One guy has to sit 45 minutes each day on an infusor, which is just the worst... but he, too was on a metal festival, going into the moshpit and everything.

I think they see startup firms advancing new technology that will eventually disrupt their markets.  So they partner with or buy the startups so that they are the ones getting $1MM-3MM per one-time treatment. They also get experience with a new technology that may possibly be used to treat a wide range of conditions. Because whoever develops a cure first has a monopoly. Takeda, or Genentech, or Behring or any of the other big names could dump every single unit of factor product they have nationwide and still make a huge profit with a cure. and there it is.   Makes sense.   Testing new technologies on the few to ramp them up on the many I mean even if it only kept me symptom free for 5 years that is better than what I deal with now and I am borderline mild.

Would not the cure-discovering company just trash it? Why would they kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? Yes at one point factor pricing was equivalent to gold pricing pound for pound. I get the impression that you think this is problematic? It is the way the world works Not surprising at all, this has been one of my chief complaints about gene therapy in its current form for the last few years. Everything is being rushed and the costs/negatives will be pushed to the patients as usual. I would rather have a durable, trustworthy product than take the \u201cfirst to market\u201d product. The pharma companies are only worried about their bottom line and keeping hemophiliacs as their cash cows. The only way to prove a gene therapy product is durable is to wait. Should they wait until all the clinical trial subjects have either stopped expressing factor or died of old age?  What is the right amount of time to wait?  - Realistically there would still be tons of people using factor who would for some reason or another be unable to receive the cure. \n\n - No one can compete with a true cure. Company XYZ's fancy new factor product may get improved on and largely pushed out of the market but not a true cure. \n\n - They can also just charge whatever price they want and insurance companies would pay for it.

Been at my desk for almost ten years. I will be vested soon. I have no windows. A repetitive job. Work with three older women. Lots of my customers are degrading to me. I have had enough and I want out.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat. I have a full Cadillac plan. 100% covered across the board. $60 a week to cover my entire family. $10 co-pays. Meds covered 100%. My knees were $180,000 and covered. My child's delivery was 100% covered. I also get six to seven weeks a year of vacation. I do not work holidays or weekends. The pay is barely livable. We are getting by, but only with my wife's paycheck and living well below our means. \n\nThese walls are closing in. The customers are driving me up a wall. The passive aggressive attitudes of the women in the office drive me insane. The stagnant air. Beige walls. The quietness. I want to be outdoors. Get out some. Buddy is a firefighter and says I should try to get on, but I doubt I could do that with the knees and injuries. Forest Ranger was another, but again not sure if I have the physical requirements for that career. \n\nI mean, there really any chance I could find something with similar benefits that has me working outside the office setting? The pay can stay the same, fine. Just need a different atmosphere. Something that challenges me. Something that I can get outside with. \n\nHow well am I doing for a hemophiliac? Thanks. I got to day I do not think you are doing too badly, especially since we are in similar situations...except for maybe that killer health plan you got.

The passive aggressive attitudes of the women in the office drive me insane. The stagnant air. Beige walls. The quietness.*\n\nHah, this is basically all of corporate America. I used to watch Office Space before I started working, thinking it was a parody . Now I watch it like a documentary. \n\nThis is hard to answer as I have no idea what you do, what you went to school for, what transferrable skills you might have.\n\nA few things I could recommend:\n\n* Personally, I would not risk taking a physical job. That is just me. Too much risk, too easy to get injured with something that could set you back weeks. So maybe try to find balance by using your off-time to get outside. Use up that vacation time and get out and camp, kayak, fish, hunt, whatever. Volunteer on the weekends for park rangers if you can find something like that. Get to know them, the job, and figure out whether you could do something like that full-time. Its certainly less taxing than becoming a firefighter.  \n\n* You have a lot of vacation. Do they get weird when you take a single day off here and there? Because my advice would be to start applying to jobs and trying to get interviews. Not to get the job, but just to see what else is out there, even if they are not jobs that you would particularly want. And often if you are not really banking on getting the job, you tend to be less nervous and interview better. Maybe that is just my experience. Sometimes it helps just to see if there is anything out there that you could make a move into, or if the grass is actually greener or not from where you are now. You will either a) find out everything sucks and yo will not do better than where you are now or b) you will find something significantly better.  \n\n* If you take another office job, it might be difficult to match the benefits package to what you have now, unless you are a kickass negotiator. So you may get something for better pay, but have to start out at 2-3 weeks vacation. And you do not want to mess with the medical coverage. Unfortunately many jobs that I have taken were because of the medical packages, not because of pay or passion for the job. But maybe you could work for a start-up, some place with more energy and less corporate beige, and still get a good benefits package.  \n\n\nGood luck, man. Thanks man. Yes, I am in the U.S. Sucks to hear about the ankles. I am sure I would have been there too, but with my knees issues I have always been cautious from the thighs down (running, kicking, stomping). With my replacements, I have noticed a slight increase in ankle bleeds.\n\nAnywho, its nice to talk to someone about careers. Something I cannot relate to anyone about. So I do not have anything to relate to. I have friends that are fire fighters, heavy equipment operators, forest rangers, cops, and race car drivers. When we get together in the shop, they often chat about their jobs meanwhile I am all like, -I got a new pair of khakis from the thrift store-.\n\nAs for assistance programs, I decline to partake in any of them. Just against my ethics. I am here to provide for myself and my family with no outside help. \n\nThanks for the response. It helps to see what its like for other. Yep, I am Michael Bolton.

The difficulty there is leaving my family for several days at a time for some me-time. \n\nI can pretty much take any day off I want. Pretty flexible. I have got 280 hours banked right now. That is a great idea on just doing interviews to see what is out there. Never even thought about it that way. \n\nAs for another office job, I would not switch from room to another. As for the medical coverage, I cannot get a better one. What I have now is, as far as I know, top tier in the state. That is the only reason I am here. Michael... *BOLTON?* That no-talent ass clown. I am 29 with severe A. I have bad ankles but no major surgeries yet. I have a desk job as well, I like my coworkers, and salary is good 55k/year.\n\nYour insurance sounds incredible, I pay $400 /month and then must pay $2,000 before it begins to assist. Once I pay the initial 2k I am responsible for 20% or all healthcare until I pay another 5,000. After that insurance covers the rest. So as a hemophiliac I am out 12,000 a year. There are non profits that help but manufactures assistance or non profit programs do not apply to my deductible or out of pocket max. It is very stressful because this has changed and gone up every year. So definitely look into benefits before accepting any offers. \n\nI know personally I could do a construction job or manufacturing. For the most part as long as I am careful I usually do not have bleeds. Usually these jobs do not offer great benefits without a union and honestly my insurance is not even considered horrible in general.\n\nIf you are mid 30's find something you can do for another 30 years because that is how long you have got left assuming your in the states. Can your joints take 30 years of hiking and medium lifting? You may be able to work at a state, City, or national Park. Any job that may require some rescue I would avoid. I know there are days I feel my joint is on the verge of a bleed and I know I can take it easier not walk as much or take whatever precautions, no one would depend on me physically, i would not jeopardize anyone. \n\nConstruction I think would be good, work 20 years and learn the industry then move to admin role within that industry possibly? Can definitely empathize with your situation. What sort of hobbies etc. do you have out of work? Having something you can enjoy off the clock can make the difference in terms of work-life balance. Motorcycles, mainly. Tough right now. We just bought a house and we have an infant. So between getting the house the way we want it, prepping the 14 cord of firewood I have on hand, and the kiddo, does not give me much free time. Once we are more settled it will be better. \n\nWork has gotten so monotonous, I have no motivation to go anymore. But, it provides the insurance for my family, keeps me out of harms way, and I have 100% job security. So, I stay. That is a smoking deal of a plan and would be hard to leave. You just do not see those kinds of plans anymore. \n\nThere is nothing else at your site or within your company you could do? Even if it were a lateral or slight demotion to \u201cgain new experience\u201d? Have you had any discussion with your supervisor about cross training in another department or looking for opportunities to transition to other departments?

Actually, the bikes have been great. Before kiddo I was riding almost 20,000 miles a year. Visited all over. Once a year I leave for a week on the bike with hammock. Travel somewhere new. Bring my meds with me. Last week I caught my ankle on the ground and felt it swelling up. I was in the middle of the woods miles away from anyone. Pulled over, made my meds, and injected right there. Worked great actually. The activities I partake in need to be outdoors, active, and get me moving. I would last about 3m painting before I walked away. Just my nature. I do fish and hunt. I hike as well. Our house is on a 65 acre wooded lot, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of conservation land, so I hike out there a bit. \n\nAs for assistance, I take help from no one. I disagree that I am being selfish. There are people that *really* need it. Since I have a job that covers my medical expenses, I am not going to leave it for something that will place me on assistance.

I started doing a series within my comic strip of more surreal stories that illustrate the ways that having a bleeding disorder has taken over my thoughts and internal monologue.  If men think about sex every 6 or 7 seconds then I feel like I have thought about Hemophilia every 3 or 4.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scenario depicted here a hypothetical argument I got into with a crossing guard that became so circular in my mind that it devolved into my brain shouting about my blood.  It is also a commentary on my anger issues that stem from contending with Hemophilia for my entire life and have unfortunately seen me act out in pointless ways often with a beleaguered female authority figure on the receiving end.  Not something I am proud of, but something that I feel I have been able to own and improve on thankfully.\n\nClotty was something my friend created and I thought they represented everything amazing and terrible about trying to make content for bleeders\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time and I hope this resonates with some of you but also I hope it does not because it probably is not very healthy mentally speaking i like the art style!   \nI wonder how many other ways you can explore this humor?  \nMaybe a word where everyone has hemophilia?   \nI would hate to see a punchline get repetitive Thank you!  I have released a few different strips already that are far less surreal than this one, but right now I have 3 of these that follow somewhat the same formula.  \n\n1: there is some kind of story happening\n\n2: it gets hijacked by blood coming out of the panel and into the margins in some unceremonious way\n\n3: it cuts out to show the dog hamster and clot reflecting on what is going on in some way (think Stephen Pastis)\n\nI think the key to keeping the formula fresh for me so far has been picking at the facets in which hemophilia has impacted my life and then making them literal.  I will DM you another one Looking at your comic and then reading your explanation I wanted to take a risk and give you a critique. I went to university for a fine arts degree (ceramics) so this is something we did every week for every project.\n\nI really enjoy the style you use for your drawing in this comic; the colors are very catching and the emphasis on red when discussing blood does draw the reader into those moments. The writing is very hard to follow and does not seem to tell the story your explanation gives. I am not a writer and if you would like pointers their I would suggest asking some other subreddits; but if you would like to express the idea of hemophilia taking over your thoughts I would suggest using clotty as a sprite on your \u201cshoulder\u201d that no one but you can interact with that is always reminding you about it; you could use this in a verity of was as negative and positive and really explore how much hemophilia infects your though processes. \n\n\nI do like what you have done and I want everyone to be successful at expressing themselves through their art; please do not take any critique personal. I appreciate your thoughts!  Running through a subreddit would be great to help me continue to reflect on the strip and keep it fresh.  Those are great ideas to chew on!\n\nI cannot take credit for the illustrations as I have had great relationships hiring them out to a variety of Fiverr artists.  I like the manga style quite a for this because I find the range of facial expressions to be quite valuable for comedy.\n\nThe strip I realize is taken out of context of the greater canon of the series that I have already published and as such is a bit more confusing that it might be if you had seen the hamster and dog interact prior to this.  I have posted a few others on this subreddit and I would be happy to show you more!\n\nAs for the notion of Clotty you are really not far off.  He is not real, but neither is the hamster.  I will go more into detail on that for certain, but for now I am trying to do a lot of showing rather than telling by trying to build out my world strip by strip and I am enjoying leaving some questions unanswersed or subtly hinted at (I will be publishing one this week where the hamster and clot do not appear, but a regular cat does to hint at this)\n\nAgain, I am glad you have enjoyed this effort and I hope you will enjoy others as I grow the characters Dammit clotty!

My constant struggle is distinguishing a bleed from chronic pain caused by past bleeds. I am currently untreated for my Von Willebrand due to Kaiser being negligently slow at getting me set up with the infusion clinic.\n\nHow do you decide? Have you contacted your local chapter of the NHF?  They may have some suggestions on how to deal with Kaiser.  You probably need to be infusing with something like humate P or alphanate to keep it from continuously getting worse. I only would go to the ER if moving around to get there will not make it worse. All they will do is either give you pain meds ( they probably will not) , or poke around and try to move it to see what is wrong (because they will not understand hemophilia in any real way) so it almost always has done more harm than good for me to see an ER dr. Sorry it is not getting any better. I would only go to the ER if you are really concerned for your life. Or you know, if they have a way to actually help, like setting a bone. In those cases they will hopefully consult a hemophilia dr or treatment center. It is probably different for every person, but for me the real indicator is if it wakes me up at night. I will have some brief episodes of pain weekly, or maybe even just soreness, but the times it is been actively bleeding, lying flat on my back caused enough pain that I just could not sleep. A lot of times if I am worried I will stand on my \"good\" leg and extend my hip so the affected leg has my foot behind the plane of my body - if that motion is painful or not even possible, then my radar goes up and I infuse and reassess.   That is too bad. That seems negligent. Is there any way you can advocate for yourself, like just call and keep calling until you get an appt with a hematologist and get a script for factor? Or, what is the hold up?  That is not good. Having an untreated bleed like this can be really serious. Are you taking transexamic acid or anything for it? Not that it would help as much as factor but it is something.  I do not think there is any over the counter stuff. But any dr should be able to prescribe transexamic acid. It is used for women with heavy periods so it should be easy to get. And it will help a little. Also, I would suggest not trying to do PT without infusing factor, unless it is helping you. But if it hurts , and you are not infusing or do not know your levels , PT sounds like a bad idea. Normally for someone without a bleeding disorder it is a different story. I have had terrible outcomes from PT\u2019s who are not trained in hemophilia. Even the ones who are, sometimes over do it. If you happen to be near Portland or San Francisco I could probably find someone who you could call and get in to see. Or if you are in alaska or Hawaii.  Otherwise I would make an appointment with a hematologist and try to get a script for humate P. If your vwd levels are low, they will be able to test, and then administer a dose to make sure you do not react badly (which no one does). Then if you were to infuse weekly (again, depending on your levels) you can begin to heal. But if you are low on vwd factor , and you are illuopsoas, or any hip muscle, or anything at all for that matter is hurting and getting worse or not healing, you need to infuse and stay very still until you see improvement before trying to even walk or move around too much or anything physical. Sorry, but if you have vonwillibrands and a bleed this is the reality. It sucks, but it is going to suck worse if you are not able to get do this. It will not get better on its own. I of coarse do not know for sure, I am assuming you are like the other people I know with vwd. It has taken a while for the medical community to catch up with the latest knowledge about vwd, so even most dr\u2019s would have to read up on the latest protocols. But this is how we are treating vwd these days. It used to be they just let them bleed and keep going to the hospital. Now it seems to be more common to just infuse regularly. I have a 75 year old patient who is just awesome, and she has just learned to infuse herself, and has finally gotten on a schedule of profolactic infusions. She is very active and not going to slow down, so she is just so happy that she can finally do all the stuff she wants to without having to slow down for bleeds. It is cool to see her so happy about it. So do not worry, you will get there. She had as many similar problems in her life I am sure. You know, I bet she would also love to talk to you about all of this if you ever wanted to. Anyways, good luck. Keep me posted if I can do anything to help. I have been there. Right when I moved away to college when I was 20 I got a serious illiopsoas bleed and could not walk for months. I was away from home and had no help but a bunch of partying college room mates. I just sat on a recliner in the living room day after day as the parties went on around me. It was awful. I hope you have some support, someone to get you stuff so you are not trying to do everything alone. You need to stay off of your legs, if you are anything like I was, that was the only thing I could do to keep the bleeding stopped.", "Can someone have hemophilia and anemia at the same time?  Sure, if you have a bleed, you lose blood and the minerals in the blood drops, like iron...witch triggers anemia... Anemia is friend of hemo:)) So the patient should also take anemia medicines or stick with hemophilia treatment You should speak with a hematologist.\nDo not take medicines without a doctors aprovel! Thank you so much for your concern \ud83e\udd17 Have a beautiful day \ud83d\udc96 Definitely. Anemia is a broad category that basically means that the red blood cells within your blood are not carrying enough oxygen. This can be from chronic bleeding which causes iron-deficiency anemia. Iron is needed by a molecule called heme which allows hemoglobin to bind oxygen. Thereby, if we bleed(we being hemophiliacs), we lose our iron and the new red blood cells do not have access to that iron, making a back-up of oxygen that will not be transported. \n\nIron-deficiency anemia, if mild to moderate, is typically treated with an oral supplement (a pill). Otherwise, if someone is severely anemic, they may require transfusion to replace the missing fully-functional red blood cells. \n\nHemophilia, on the other hand, is specifically related to the clotting proteins: Hemophilia A being Factor 8, and Hemophilia B being Factor 9. Neither of these are directly influenced by anemia, but being anemic can cause healing problems, wound infection, among other symptoms like light-headedness or fatigue. \n\nThere are other types of anemia like pernicious anemia that is similar in that the red blood cells are not working properly, but that is a different mechanism.\n\nTLDR: yes, hemophilia and anemia can occur together, make sure to talk to you doctor to make sure you have the right dietary and/or supplement intake You too! Of course. I presume most of us are anemic at least occasionally when battling a bleed Yeah you are right Yeah its typically how it goes. You loose blood, you loose nutrients and iron.

Prior to that, I had multiple untreated and prolonged bleeds into my ankles usually lasting 2 weeks or more. Those really tore up my ankles, but since reaching adulthood, I rarely have any major bleeding issues. Even with my weak ankles, I do not recall the last time I had an actual bleed into one of them. The times I have gotten Factor VIII as an adult have been so infrequent that I can only clearly remember the last two times I did get treated: once after getting a few teeth pulled and again when I (stupidly) had been popping ibuprofen daily for body aches. Bleeding ulcers put me in the hospital for a couple of days.\n\nI have not been to an adult hemo clinic at all as an adult (or at least since I was about 20, I am 42 now), but I do have an appointment in a couple of weeks. My ankle pain has gotten worse over the years and my public health clinic (I always get whatever resident happens to be there that day) does not seem to care about it. I am hoping the hemo doctors will have some options for me.\n\nAs a testament to how mild my condition is, I just completed a GoRuck Light challenge on Saturday. It is a military boot camp style endurance event that was 5 hours long covering 7 miles while carrying an extra 20 lbs of weight. I went in fully expecting my ankles to give out on me and cause me to have to bail out. I barely made it through, but mainly due to my lack of physical fitness. Every muscle group in my body was sore and I could barely move all weekend. I struggled through the pain from my ankles during the event, but miraculously I did not feel any worse pain from them than I normally do afterwards. I also hurt my shoulder from some rolling exercises where my full body weight came down on my left shoulder. I have some soreness and pain, but no bleeds or even bruising.\n\nSince it is been so long since I have been to a real hemo doctor, I am sure they will do a full work up to make sure that the original severe diagnosis was not incorrect, but they had already done that when I was a kid.

Yes and no with how i was taught if i have a daughter she will be a carrier and will pass on hemophilia to her children where as if i have a boy he shouldnt have it but you also never know as it skipped a generation in my family entirely so it can be a toss up Well, my understanding is that Factor 8 and 9 are X chromosome linked disorders. Since you do not say what gender you are, I will assume you are male. If you have a daughter, you are necessarily passing your X chromosome and the mother another X, so your daughter will have the gene as a carrier. She has a fifty/fifty chance of having a hemophiliac son, or a daughter who is a carrier as well.  If you have a son, you are passing your unaffected Y chromosome and so your son would not have hemophilia, nor would there be a way for them to pass it on. If there are any geneticists in the house, feel free to correct me if I get anything wrong. There is a lot of information missing here but I will provide what I can. I am not sure for VWD, but for factor 8 deficiency it goes as follows.\n\nHemophilia male + Hemophilia female = Hemophilia child\n\nNo Hemophilia male + Hemophilia female = Hemophilia child\n\nHemophilia male + no Hemophilia female = no Hemophilia child.\n\nNo Hemophilia in either obviously means no Hemophilia baby.\n\nBasically it is only carried and transmitted via the x chromosome which your child will receive only from the mother. Female Hemophilia carries are often non symptomatic. Meaning the only real way to be sure if a female has Hemophilia is a blood test which any doctor can do. Also a great place to ask any more questions regarding this topic This is my understanding as well, so long as OP is male and does not have a child with a female carrier. If you have an HTC you see, they should be able to give you some genetic counseling. I would ask them.

We have a letter for our kids with hemophilia to carry when traveling.  Aside from needing to carry factor and supplies, and needing to possibly infuse in the airport, can any of you give me additional topics we should address in the letter? I got ran over, stomped on, and dragged out! Just joking. I am doing Immune Tolerance Therapy (ITT/ITI) so I have to take tons of factor 8.\n\nHow is the ACE-910 going for you? I do not know what else the letter includes. But I think having their contact info, amount of factor, name of factor, emergency contact info (besides you guys) would be helpful.  Got that already.  Any other ideas?  Frequent target joint or bleeding sites? So you are trying to beat an inhibitor? Woof, good luck with that.\n\nIt is going great! 3 months since my last IV infusion, all my joints cooperating, walked 12 miles around Seoul yesterday and had more to drink than I probably have in the last 3 years and did not feel it in my ankles like I usually do. If you are REALLY paranoid, easy-to-understand photos of how the treatment is prepared in case they need assistance. Also contact info for their HTC/hematologist/pediatrician.\n\nI do not think info on target joints would matter that much. Not paranoid, just want my letters to actually help my patients.  Since you are adults and have gone through childhood and teens, thought this board might be a source of things we missed. Ah, I see! I thought you meant that these were for *your* kids, not patients (hence why I was surprised that you did not mention HTC contact info).\n\nIn that case, definitely a simple photo guide to infusing (even if the kids are capable of self-infusing - and I have no idea what the age for that is these days - they may need help). Yaaaas! Druggies have offered me cash money for my one-handed clickable tourniquet. \ud83d\udc89 \ud83d\udcb8 So, I grew up in a small town, where dealing with my disorder was coordinated by the hemophilia center 200 miles away. So, maybe if your kids are traveling somewhere where the medical infrastructure is not up to par, it is important to put the information for how to get ahold of the hemophilia center that knows your kids. If I have trauma and get taken to a local hospital, it will not do me any good, since I am the only hemophilia type a guy here. Make sure they know to take them to a real hospital with hemophilia experience. My hospital does not even keep factor. I have to bring it with me.  Great suggestion . I will add this. I am glad its helping you! Glad your ankles held up. ", "Pretty bad internal bleed (update 2) Hey everyone. Sorry I know it is been more then a week. Been waiting on some test results. Hematoma still fairly large. They did a contrast test to see if anything is getting past my duodenum. That was 2 days ago and I still have not heard the results. Still getting the IV nutrition through my picc, so I cannot imagine the results being good. NG tube still in. Hemoglobin levels are great, all my readings seem to be good except they have me on high blood pressure medication which is weird because I am 23. Feeling pretty good atm. Hopefully out by Christmas! I have a great roommate now too. Really funny, nice guy. Unfortunately he has Leukemia.

Just inquired about it.. not available in Canada if you do not have an inhibitor :( I am in the US and have been on Hemlibra since early 2018. It is been awesome. Hemophila A, severe with low inhibitors, and zero bleedings since then. That is the bummer about socialized medical care. Granted you do not have to pay for it but you do not get the benefits of a competitive market Been on it since early Spring. Not a single joint bleed. Would recommend. We have socialised medical care in the UK... and it is become available to those without inhibitors too now. I am sure it will arrive in Canada relatively soon. It could be largely down to your regulatory body in Canada. Usually the FDA is first to approve new medicines so the US are likely to get access first, usually followed by EMA (European Medical Agency) approval. I am not very clued up on the processes in Canada, but I am sure it cannot be too far off. Always worth asking your haemophilia team about it to stay updated more than anything. The Canadian Haemophilia Society may have some info too Happy to hear its working for you so far! Awesome! I have heard a lot of good stories from inhibitor guys I know who moved to it. A new effective treatment was long overdue for the inhibitor community. I hope it continues to work out for you Thanks.

My concern is should I factor up before hand or after? I only treat as needed. Did not know if the swab can cause bleeding in the sinus cavity. Thanks. I had a nasopharyngeal swab a long time ago for the flu and my nose bled for about 30 minutes. I personally think the nurse was a bit rough, so my experience may be a bit more unique. I tend to request a saline mist prior to them now. I do not worry about my factor levels, though.\n\nThey do have throat swabs available for coronavirus tests. If it is an option where you are, might want to try for it. I was tested with a nose swab, no need to dose from my experience. Only had to go in about an inch, no bleeding, only a risk of coughing and sneezing. Others experiences may vary. Thanks Thanks No need. No problem. Assuming you need to be tested, good luck friend I did not factor infuse before and got a moderate nose bleed after (about an hour of mild bleeding from the nose. Not a gusher) \nBut I had the nasal swab that goes very very deep into the nasal passages. Maybe 6 inches or so? \nIf I had to retest, I would infuse factor beforehand. 6 inches is 15.24 cm I have Von Willebrand's and have been tested twice. Once with a nasal swab up boh nostrils, and the other a laryngeal swab to the back of the throat. The swabs are like really long Q-Tips that are then bagged and sent to the lab for analysis- it is not invasively pokey in the way your average blood tests are. I had a pretty minor nosebleed afterwords, the test is unpleasant but it was anything super serious. Had a test, it is uncomfortable but no bleeding Von Willebrands here too, you do not instant nose bleed as soon as anything more solid than your own snots touches the insides??? Lucky. Oh, it was so painful. I have consistent nose bleeds because of dry nasal passages, and they were all scabbard up basically when I had it done. I am surprised it did not dislodge anything.", "A question about hemophilia and smoking cigarettes I am a severe type A hemophiliac. I started smoking about 3 months ago, only when hanging out with friends, so a pack would last me for about a week, and in the past month i have had 3 bleeds, which is more than the usual 0 or 1, but i thought it was just a coincidence because sometimes my factor level drops super low even while on prophylaxis, so i didnt make a connection with it being from the cigarettes. \n\nRecently however i found out that nicotine and ammonia, which is also in cigarettes, increases heart rate and blood pressure, which made me think that maybe me smoking makes my internal bleeds worse or even causes them, explaining the amount of bleeds i have had in the past month. Have any of you ever talked with your doctors about  the effects of smoking on severe hemophiliacs or have any info about this that im not aware of?\n\nI have already decided that im quitting smoking, mostly because i do not enjoy smoking as much as i thought i would, and also because of the long list of other health problems it causes, so you do not have to tell me that i should quit regardless if it has any connection with the bleeds. Smoking is definitely not good. The sooner you can quit, the better. People really struggle to quit after a certain period of time. \n\nThat said I know many smokers and I have not really seen any data about smokers vs non smokers. As a former smoker who still gives in to temptation when consuming alcohol, it certainly did not do me any favors. Probably played a big part in why I developed hypertension. We are not perfect, but if you are old enough to ask for advice, it is way too late to pick up a smoking habit. Hi, i am also a severe A hemophiliac (&lt;1%) and i have been smoking lightly for approximately 2 years now. By that i mean i even had a 3 month break in quarantine but i seem to pick up on it on periods of stress and when i am sad.\n\nAnyway, i never noticed my bleeds getting more frequent or anything hemophilia related. So in my case cigarettes had no negative effect on me.\n\nWith that being said i am indeed interested to know whether it does play a negative role for a hemophiliac specifically when it comes to substances carried in blood.\n\nI am not going to tell you the general negative effects of smoking. Everyone knows them. Trust me smokers know them better than non smokers who seem to always be the ones to rush in and tell people they should stop this disgusting habit.  \nBut specifically for a hemophiliac it is important not to smoke because unfortunately we do not get the chance to do cardio exercise as much and by smoking we risk having lung issues way earlier than others.\n\nLastly, you made the right choice to quit. Throw it away and never even allow your mind to think of it. It is all in our heads. Our minds can play the trickiest games but is up to us not to give in to any sort of temptation. I am Hemophilia A severe. Listen to your body. If you think it makes things worse it probably does. There is not any actual data on these kinds of things tho, that I have ever seen (things that cause bleeds to be better or worse or more/less frequent, besides hemophilia products). There is still a lot that is not known about hemophilia. I do believe that everything you can possibly do to be healthier will improve your symptoms of hemophilia. I have always been pretty strict with my health, as far as eating right and mild exercise and not putting too much other crap in my body, and I am 46 and as healthy as I was at 18. Probably healthier. But I e had as many or more bleeds than other people I know like me. Definitely I am more active and I bleed less now then when I was younger. I did smoke a lot of weed in my 20\u2019s , probably more than someone should. I am not sure how it affected my bleeds. At times I thought there was no difference, but if I was having a bleed start and I smoked I felt like it made it worse, but it also could have been that it made me focus on it more , being high and overthinking it or whatever. I really do think every little thing adds up health wise. So dealing with something like hemophilia , those little things have more impact , because hemophilia is pretty tough to deal with. Also, every person I know who smokes cigarettes hate it and wishes they could quit. So that in itself is more than enough reason to quit. As a long time smoker, give it up now. There is nothing to gain from it. Yeah, the blood pressure thing is one thing I feel contributes. I have noticed a bunch of things that seem...\n\nActually, why are not you on Hemlibra? Just get on it immediately if possible. \n\nI am 33 and in the middle of quitting smoking again because I stupidly started again a couple months ago after probably half a year+ that I quit, and it is just pointless but *also* harder to quit the more you do it. I have quit a bunch of times for long durations, but it always feels a bit harder each time depending on how many I am smoking typically.\n\nOtherwise, Hemlibra would make it so you really would not need to worry about slight changes like that. Unless you get wasted and have a foam sword fight in an alley and fall backwards twisting your knee. That is one way to have a breakthrough bleed from hell. Easily one of my most painful top 20 bleeds, I would guess. Here is how much smoking affects healing...\n\nWhen I got my ankle fused, I was told that if I were smoking there would only be around 20%.    \n\nIf I was not, I had a decent 80% chance the fusion would go perfectly.  \n\nAnd it did, because I was not smoking.   Not sure how much vaping affects healing, but do not mess with nicotine.  Not worth anything.", "Is anyone experiencing mouth bleeding with Helimbra? ever since i started hemlibra, my body feels great, no joint or muscle bleeding ever. i feel a lot stronger BUT\n\nevery month, once or twice a month, i bleeding from my gums, always random places in the mouth too. ive went to the dentist, they found nothing, had cleanings, upped my mouth hygiene game, but still it happens. my HTC recently told me that it is happening for others on Hemlibra too, not sure if anyone here is experiencing it also?\n\nI feel alone, I have had a long history with this condition and every fight has been a challenge, and just when I thought I was over the hill, these days set me back, mentally most of all. you never get used to tasting your own blood. I am in a Hemlibra group on Facebook. You Might get more answers there:\n\n I think what is happening with some of us is that there are variations in hemophilia A. For instance, the synthetic factor VIII, or any factor VIII that does not also have vonwilibrands factor in it also, will not work for me. I need them both to stop bleeds. Hemlibra only covers your factor VIII to an equivalent of around 40% factor VIII level. If you used to use factor and it raised your level to around 80%, that would be enough to stop most bleeds. Hemlibra is great, but it does not compare to prophylactic infusions. If I were you I would just infuse a small dose of factor when you need to. Or , if you are only having mouth stuff maybe ask you doctor about using tranexamic acid (lysteda). There is a chance that you have low vonwilibrands levels too, and using lots of factor supplemented that, or was enough to help. I think we are going to see that Hemlibra is great for maintenence, but does not quite do it for everyone. I still use factor about once a week. If I do not I end up with small bleeds that in time do not heal and become bad. Hemlibra has cut my factor usage down by a lot, so it is been great. But this idea of \u201cwait and see if Hemlibra will stop a bleed\u201d is bullshit. If I am bleeding that means Hemlibra did not stop it and I am not going to wait and see. That is what factor is for. Luckily my insurance has been covering both because I use so much less factor now. But if I had to choose between one or the other I would have to go back on prophylactic infusions. And I have to use Alphanate or something like that with vonwilibrands factor in it also. Cannot comment about Hemlibra, still trying to get on it unfortunately. But maybe ask your hematologist about Amicar? On Hemlibra for two years and recently had root canal no sign of mouth bleeding Try this for 10 days. Rinse with a mouthwash after every meal, preferably something with chlorhexidine. Have transemic acid tablets 1000 mg 3 times a day. Of course, talk to a dentist and your hematologist also. \n\nDo check on the hemlibra effect also. I have not heard of it so far. I have severe Von Willebrands and my FVIII levels are about 20%. I have to be careful brushing/flossing as my gums will bleed easily. \n\nTranexamic acid tablets dissolve pretty well in warmish water (boil then cooled) - use as a mouth wash &amp; swallow 2-3 times a day. (Taste is yuck but it works) \n\nIt may be worth getting your VWF levels checked too? \nRealistically Hemlibra only gives you ~20% levels so you will still bleed easily and gums are super sensitive... This is where I am at with the decision as well. I have been on Alphanate for over a decade now because of VWF, and just recently had my levels checked again. They seem to be more normal range levels for me, which may open up a few more options, though I am still skeptical about switching to Hemlibra. I am so used to prophy every other day at this point, and knowing how safe/proven recombinant is, it is hard for me to see the benefit at my age. For younger children, those with inhibitors, or countries with limited access, it makes a lot of sense, but I am personally in no rush to switch right now.\n\nSide rant (for this sub in general):\nI also feel like this thread is nothing but a peer pressure group for Hemlibra at this point. Seems like every post is, \"Have you heard the good word of our saviour Hemlibra? Ask your hematologist if Hemlibra is right for you?\"... Yes, we have heard of it, stop trying to convince everyone with your anecdotal evidence. Everyone is different when it comes to how/when/what they treat. \n\nDo not get me wrong your experience or complications being shared are helpful, such as OP's. Everyone else here shilling for big pharma... not so much. Yea trust me I am not pushing for people to use Hemlibra. If I had any veins left I would probably still be on alphanate prophy. It does work better. But what I will say about Hemlibra is that even though it only put me around 40%, it is a constant 40%. It seems like it does not drop below when my body uses it, like with factor. So I can see some benefits in that. I think the best treatment for me right now is to use Hemlibra and still infuse whenever I feel a bleed coming on, or sore even. Because the Hemlibra does keep me from bleeding most of the time, so that means pretty much any soreness is a bleed, and when I take factor now it works quicker and better, because the bleed has not been allowed to get as bad as fast. I know, people get sore, but I know the difference between regular sore muscles or a bruise, and a bleed. The problem is that doctors seem careful to prescribe enough factor on top of a Hemlibra script, or insurance might start having questions. So far I was able to convince my doctors that I really am having bleeds while on Hemlibra (and I am not just infusing for fun), and so far my insurance has not had any problems. So even though it is been a little tricky learning how to tell what is what now that I basically  have mild hemophilia on Hemlibra, which has made everything different- how bleeds feel, how bad they get- it has made me have to second guess what I am feeling and re-evaluate when to infuse and what is a bleed and what is just pain, I still think that Hemlibra has been a life changer. In that I do not have to infuse every other day. Now I infuse way less. And I was at the end of my rope with prophy- my veins were shot and after 35 years of infusing every other day I was beyond sick of the routine. My health has improved as well, as I have been more active due to less bleeds. So I do have some praise for Hemlibra. I just think people need to be careful thinking it is a cure or all you need to be safe. It is important to have factor ready for emergency\u2019s just like before. I am afraid people are going to get lax and forget to pack emergency doses of factor and end up in a really bad spot. Or parents getting lax and thinking they do not need to know how to infuse their kids. There is a long list of things that could backfire with Hemlibra. More joint damage from untreated trickle bleeds for instance. It is hard to say until we see the kids brought up on this stuff wether it is a better option or not. There is a lot to consider. It is been helpful for me tho. And I know a few people who do not want to try it, for different reasons, and people who have tried it and are questioning wether to stay on it or not.", "National Conference for Women with Hemophilia I want to make a plug for the National Conference for Women with Hemophilia.

Does anyone else get immensely frustrated that the only way in the US any of us can afford our insurance plans to cover the crazy cost of our Factor is by having the makers whom themselves dictate the insane prices of the medication subsidized our co-payments? \n\nThis health-care system is beyond broken, and the co-pay assistance programs act like their helping patients but it is just a mechanism to keep Factor costs completely unaffordable to the un-insured and those unable to afford a good plan. \n\nIn 2017 the average cost of Factor VIII in the US was $2.52 USD while in the UK it was $0.92, and as Low as $0.63 in the Netherlands, and $0.27 in South Africa.  \n\n\nFuck the United States Healthcare and Pharmaceutical System for profiting off of my Bleeding disorder. Umm. Well for one I agree that the system is pretty broken. But also there are ways to get completely free factor from the manufacturers. Also I am curious about your numbers down there are you missing some zeros? Those numbers are likely per unit.\n\nThere are also many people who need factor in emergencies and cannot possibly get manufacturer help with the costs at that point - and honestly not even everyone who can benefit from those programs knows about them anyway. That makes more sense. I have never really looked at factor cost per unit so much as cost of an entire dose. And you are correct in an emergency getting factor from the manufacture is not going to be easy. It is the worst part about being a hemophiliac IMO. Always reliant on health insurance. Which even they fuck up sometimes and you are left high and dry. Which is a whole other issue. I have watched friends drop everything move to a new state and it is no big deal. And I am like yeah I cannot afford to not have health coverage I will be staying here with my steady paying job. They are  per unit numbers. I understand they have systems in place to subsidize the cost of the medication, the problem is that we should not have to beg for medication from companies that make them impossibly expensive. I have not had my factor in 2 months I am still waiting for them to approve everything and send my shit. And all the while working. So yeah fuck the health care system of the u.s I am about to lose my shit. Im sorry homie Ive been there, hoping that they help you out soon \ud83d\ude4f I know it probably varies a lot across the country but the way factor is billed with my insurance is \u201cmajor medical\u201d so eloctate essentially pays my out of pocket max for the year and then everything is covered 100 percent.  I did the math and my Eloctate is 2.00 a unit turns out. \n\nI agree it is immensely frustrating but until there is a major paradigm shift in this country it is never going to change.

If you are interested in under standing the American Healthcare problem in general a little better, this podcast is a really interesting look at the history of it. \n\nThroughline\u2019s other content is phenomenal as well.\n\nAlso these can be tricky to find but here is an example of Missouri\u2019s specialty MAC(maximum allowable cost) list, there are factor products on it.  Do not get me wrong here... I completely agree. The US healthcare system is a monstrous pay to play game of life and death. Got a steroid injection in my ankle and found out after the fact that while the pharmaceuticals only cost about 50 bucks the \"procedure\" cost 1500... AFTER my insurance co-pays and what not. \n\nStill though... Factor is never going to be affordable. Even at your cost examples. My prophy before Hemlibra was 6500iu 2/WK. 6500*.62*2 is $8060/WK. In all fairness clotting factor is absurdly difficult to produce and does not actually have that many of us to spread the cost out. It could be much cheaper than it is... But it will never be cheap. \n\nA much better example of how F'd the US healthcare system is is procedure costs and medications like insulin. Which CAN be very easily mass produced and is dirt cheap in most parts of the civilized world but is outrageously expensive here. Or the fact that two syringes, two needles, some iodine, some alcohol, some anesthetics and some steroids, combined with about 20 total seconds of fluoroscopy somehow cost 5 grand. Which my insurance generously (/s) covered all but 1.5k of. I mean stop to consider that even the 5k is the \"negotiated rate\" agreed to between the insurance and the hospital. The hospital's listed cost for that is MUCH higher. And just stupidly absurdly inflated. \n\nWe pay more for less efficiency and poorer outcomes than anyone else in the world. Sorry for all the expenses in America. We have no way of knowing what that is like but offer our sympathy. In Canada the factors are considered a blood product and come from our blood bank and therefore are not a medication expense.

I am only talking like once every few months for a day; two at most. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do some of you take care of this?  Go get yourself a prescription for celebrex..  I shot my hematologist and email about that, and she called me back within two minutes. I guess that is a process that takes about a week to work. I am just looking for something that has a little more \"kick\" than Tylenol. She suggested that I take a smaller dose of my Helixate and take an Aleve. So I guess I will go that route. Yep. That is good advice. Infuse and you will be fine. Aleve only adds to bleeding if you are super low on factor.  Also talk to your hematologist about whether you need to see a physical therapist regarding your back if you keep having problems. They may be able to show you exercises to build up the part that is giving you problems. I have had a few issues with my back over the years. Not sure if it is possible where you live but I would definitely recommend medical marijuana.

I am 23 with hemophilia A with inhibitors now and on hemlibra for 21 months with just 1-2 bleeds in these 21 months. but before hemlibra I had lot of bleeds in my ankle. So it was one my targeted joints.\nNow according to hematologist and orthopaedic surgeon. I am in very early stage and ankle fusion is very last option. And I do not have lot of pain just small pain when I start walking after some time of walking I do not feel pain. And I can easily walk around 2-3 kms.\nSo Doctors recommend me shoes and anklet or splints\nSo I wanted fellow patients opinion on some nice shoes? And anklet or splints?\nAnd also any medicine should I take that helps?\nAny suggestions so that I can avoid surgery in later years?\nAll suggestions are welcome\nThank you Glucosamine w/ chondroitin worked for me for quite a while. Some say it has no proven effect but if I stopped taking it (ran out and forgot to buy more) I would start hurting again and realize \"oh ya, forgot to buy more and it is been a week since I last had it. \n\nAs far as ankle wraps and splints go, compression  sleeves would probably work well for you. I also bought a velcro on on Amazon for 10$ that believe it or I saw in some random internet ad (usually I avoid those like the plague).  Any suggestions on shoes ?\nI was looking into  Any suggestions on shoes ?\nI was looking into  Honestly, I am in a really wierd place with shoes at the moment. If theres too much support / to much pressure around my ankle, it causes it to hurt worse than if I tie my shitty $15 Walmart shoes loose rather than tight. These cheap shoes actually work better than my nikes or sketchers at the moment. Granted I havent bought a new pair of shoes in like 2 years.... I am just afraid to spend money on them and 2 days later realize they hurt me feet and go back to my cheapos I am 25, both ankles have serious arthrosis. \n\nI am planning to buy one of these (link below). They are engineered to make you use your ankles the right way. \n\nThe key is to move your ankles a lot! I know its painful. These shose will help you to strengthen you muscles in your leg. Also check out Youtube for ankle rehabiliation exercises.\n\nFusing your ankles will be a temporary solution and you will probably end up with the same problems in your knees.\n\nLink: \n\nThere is an other brand I know of, called MTB. Go check out them as well. I like Swed-o ankle braces. Once they form to your ankle they are comfortable and can fit in shoes. My hematologist actually advised me to stay away from glucosamine as he had patients bleed more often while taking it. I have got onset arthritis in my right ankle, basically rolled it too many times when I was younger. \n\nI was offered fusing as an option but was told that would mean restricted movement in the ankle from then on in which I was not up for. I have found regular exercising, stretching, balancing err. helpful but I will get sharp shooting pains in the ankle the next day. I tend to try and ride the pain out until it subsided with the hope that it will get less and less the more I get used to it. Straps I hear can make your ankles weaker with extended use so I would recommend, if you can, to only use it when you are very active to prevent injury. This is not exactly medical advise, more my own hypothesis. Curious if any others take a similar approach?\n\nAlso came across some ointment that seems to help ease the pain: cbdfx overnight recovery balm - may be worth trying? i had a history of ankle injuries that led medical types to make the same prediction of fusion for me around your age. \n\nI fought it, \u201cnever getting a fusion\u201d outlook. \n\nfinally, at 44, I was bone-on-bone with microfractures and the deepest damn pain I would ever felt. I got the fusion. \n\nWhat I learned was that I could have had an easier recovery and less trauma if I would allowed myself the fusion earlier. I also would not have spent so many family vacation days with my ankle bandaged or etc. \n\ntl; dr  I should have gotten the fusion at least five years before I did\n\nSo be open to the fusion idea.

I will obviously be working with my Dr to come up with an appropriate plan, but figured I would check with you all too. \n\nThanks! Definitely work with your HTC on a plan. 15 years ago when I had mine removed, they insisted the surgery happen in the hospital and stay overnight for observation. Of course depends on a lot of factors (no pun intended) -- how many are being removed, whether they are impacted, etc. I would definitely suggest Amicar, my clots kept falling out but as soon as they thought to give me this it solved all my problems Absolutely agree with this. Amicable tastes gross and it sucks but do not skip it. I skimped on it and had an absolutely awful experience being on pain pills and trying to infuse but kept blowing my vein. I ended up having to call a nurse to come help at home because I could not get the bleeding to stop on my own all because I stubbornly did not use the rinse as prescribed. Even when you think it is done the job and you do not need it anymore, you definitely still do. \n\nI am a moderate B for reference. I imagine this probably depends on how well you respond to stimate. I am a mild, ~10% and stimate takes me to ~40%, and even that seems low for a procedure like that.

This has been one crazy wild ride.  \n\nOver my times, I have had bouts of my heart going absolutely wonky.  PVC's, atrial fibrillation.  Not fun stuff.   As of this weekend, I have had this a few times\n\n* -This time\n* -5 years ago (2014)\n* -14 years ago (2005)\n* -18 years ago (2001)\n\nI had some tests done in 2014, and two things were discovered.  I have a PFO (hole in the heart that usually closes up before birth), and conductivity spurring on the PVCs from an unusual location.  The doc said he could ablaze that part, but it would be a 50/50 shot.   (In other words, he had no idea)\n\nLast night, I was at my wits end from feeling the PVC's for 4 or 5 days.   Then my heart really started going nuts.   Or it felt like it.  I called 911, an ambulance came.    I sat there for a while, and talked some things over with the paramedics.   \n\nI could feel my heart coming back from crazy train, to \"predictable PVCs.\"   I am fortunate enough to have one person to come keep me company, so if anything happened, at least someone would be here.\n\nI woke up in regular sinus rhythm.\n\nSo, here is the meat and potatoes.   I am really starting to wonder if the PFO (which are known to cause clots and stokes) are allowing some weird mechanism to be enabled, when I am dosing myself to perhaps put a clot in a weird spot of the heart, and it works through it, and then everything goes back to normal.\n\nMake sense?   Pretty simple, but I suppose this is just me wanting to be heard.   I will tell my doc this in my upcoming appts, but I know it will fall on deft ears, like most everything hemophila does.   \n\nThe main reason I am throwing this out there is if anyone else has had a PFO and problems.    \n\nThanks! I do not have PVC or afib, but do you see a hematologist or is your doctor more of a GP? My hematologist (and even my neurologist) are always champing at the bit to be able to work with me on unusual intersections of medical cases like these, so if you are afraid your doctor will be a little \"eh whatever\" maybe a cardiologist will want to get to the bottom of it.

Current treatment not working well Anybody out there tried Esperoct? Been having a hard time finding a product that works well for me, and I am leaning towards it or re-trialing Hemlibra. I had been on every day dosing of Kogenate for a number of years which worked pretty well for me, but obviously dosing everyday is a PITA. I switched to Eloctate for about a year, but always had issues with some breakthrough bleeding when I was getting close to my trough despite every other day dosing. I have a pretty fast factor metabolism unfortunately despite not having an undetectable inhibitor ( I was tolerized as a kid).\n\nI did try Hemlibra this year, but I was recovering from an ankle surgery at the time and had a few break through bleeds in my ankle so I switched back to Eloctate. I am considering giving Hemlibra another try, but honestly am hesitant to be off Factor entirely.\n\nFor whatever reason, it seems like my bleeding tendency has gotten worse as I have gotten older, even without the presence of an inhibitor. I am having a pretty hard time finding a product that works well for me, in terms of convenience as well as efficacy. Very curious to hear if anyone else has had a similar experience, especially as they have aged. I am not exactly old (in my early 30s), but I am definitely not feeling as good as I had hoped I would at this age. I have had a very similar experience. Any of the factor products that do not also have vonwillibrand factor in them do not work for me. I do not have an inhibitor. Hemlibra has been great, but I have to still use alphanate probably once every couple weeks on average or more for breakthrough bleeds. But I figure that is so much better than every other day or even every day for me ,sometimes is what it took. I just had to convince my doctor that this is just how it works for me. Luckily they have known me my whole life and know that I have always bled a lot. But I am also in really good shape for my age (45) and having severe Hemophilia. So it is kind of a strange thing to bleed so much but also to be able to keep it under control. Maybe I have used more factor because I knew that is what it took to stay healthy. I think it is probably partly that.. But the synthetic factors did not work for me. That is for sure. I know some folks who do well with Hemlibra with once weekly factor as prophylaxis combined with Hemlibra. Also some folks who did better once weekly hemlibra than once monthly. Would be worth talking to your hematologist about. I have to admit it seems like the synthetic factors do not work as well for me either. Growing up I was on Baxter recombinate and it seemed to work better than any of the synthetic factors I have tried. But I tried to go back to it at one point and it never worked as well as I thought it did in the past, and I have no idea why. My joints were in much better shape 10+ years ago and I was a lot more active so I think that might have something to do with it as well. When I tried hemlibra I dosed twice a month. I will ask about my htc\u2019s experience with having patients dose weekly vs once every two weeks. Frankly I am a bit frustrated because no one at my htc has given me a strong recommendation. They have basically left it up to me, and I do not feel particularly confident in any of the suggestions they have made over the others. \n\nMy concern with hemlibra is that I seem to bleed much easier when my factor level gets down somewhere between 20-30%. From my understanding hemlibra theoretically keeps you anywhere between an equivalent 5-30% factor level. They (hemlibra and factor viii) are totally different molecules, and it is been explained to me that this equivalence is theoretical and not necessarily indicative of how well it will work for an individual person, but I still find it concerning and it causes me to lack confidence in hemlibra working for me. Yea some hematologists seem to think that when the vonwilibrands is already bonded with the factor VIII , like in alphanate and a couple other of the older products, that some people\u2019s bodies do not bind them together as easily. Hemlibra is nice because it puts me about where a mild or moderate hemophiliac would be , which I feel like is harder on my joints. I feel like it takes longer to recognize small bleeds. And some of them are stopped by the Hemlibra, but not enough to not do a little damage. I never used to have joint problems but on Hemlibra I do. So I am lucky that my insurance still covers both. So I just do a shot at the sign of a bleed like I would before, they just stop easier and do not get as bad, or need as much follow up infusions. But that advise they have about Hemlibra \u201cif you feel like you have a bleed , just rest and ice and wait and see, and it will probably get better\u201d, fuck that. It does not get better in my case. I have dealt with two really bad elbow bleeds from following that advise, and a bunch of other smaller joint bleeds before I decided to just infuse when it hurts at all. Now I am doing good and using 1/10 of the factor I used to. And I am able to get in better shape and not be a pin cushion. Some people seem to be doing great on Hemlibra and are not using much factor. But it is important to remember that it only raises you to around the equivalent of  30-40% factor VIII, so in case of an injury or surgery, you are going to need factor still. You probably were having small bleeds still after your surgery and the Hemlibra just was not enough to cover you. And the dr\u2019s must not have realized it. It is too bad. But I would think that if you started Hemlibra with the caveat of  wing able to infuse whenever you feel you need to, that would be ideal. It does take some getting used to because bleeds come on way slower and are less aggressive. But I have learned to still tell when it is time to infuse. I was on it for about 5 years while it was in trials.  I had no problems what-so-ever on it.  I do not recall a single break-through bleed.  I did have a handful of trauma related bleeds (one every 2-3 months).  I was on a Monday/Friday prophy schedule.  When I would get a trauma bleed, it was always at the end before I was going to dose again, so it makes sense.\n\nHonestly, the only reason I did not stay on it was coverage issues.  I switched to Hemlibra and Advate.  It is been, I believe, almost three months now.  I have not treated with anything but Hemlibra.\n\nI can only speak for myself, but both options have worked well for me.  I hope you find some relief. Glad to hear you had a good experience on it, as well as your current regimen! One of my concerns with trying Esperoct is that I assume I would probably have to take it more frequently than twice a week, since I burn through Eloctate so fast. If that were the case I would be exposed to more PEG, but that might not matter also. I have never been on a pegylated product before though, so the only way to find out for sure is to try it I guess. If PEG means pegylated Factor VIII, I was like a tank when I was on it. Totally no fear of bleeding at all. However, my HTC was concerned about the long term consequences of taking so much pegylated product so it is currently unavailable for sale in my country.

If he was on ITI, or was on ITI but now has weaned to a high dose prophylactic schedule, this could easily hit a million bucks a month.\n\nI teach hemophilia to med students and get them to think about the dosing of these products by calculating how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway B each dose would buy. It is always been a joke that my family and friends have made that I was the \"Million Dollar Man\"....but \"Million Dollars a Month Man\" has me beat. Good on him. Up until about 5 years ago I lived, and grew up in Iowa, and while I rarely hit the million a month mark I typically averaged about 400,000 per month. This was when I was attending college so I was infusing about twice a day with novo7 on what the HTC started calling a modified prophylaxis, it generally worked too. Those 3 year I had very few bleeds, but it cost a ton.\n\nIf I had a bleed that lasted 4-5 days that there would easily hit 250,000. This shit is expensive and the people lobbying for hemophilia really need to start pushing harder on the law makers to figure out a way we, and other extreme cost disorders, are handled.

This article hit USA Today..   \n\nA number of people stating he should just die..  or the parents should never have had kids... makes me angry and sad... Looks like the insurance company was able to generate exactly the kind of reaction they wanted. Is subsidized medicine in Europe and other socialized systems a large reason for high drug prices in the US?  I always thought drugs in the U.S. were priced by what the market (and more recently, public opinion) could bear. So consider a problem.  Suppose you make widgets that cost you $500 to make, and cost you $10,000 to develop.  Say your widget has a commercial life of 5 years so your development costs and the production costs would have to be recouped at a rate of at least $2500 to break even.  \n\nSay that you have three markets.  Two will buy your widgets, but demand you sell them at $100 each.  You have a choice of selling at this price or none at all.  You then have to make all your money in market three.\n\nCanada buys all their country's factor once.  They can demand a deal and the companies give it.  Other socialized systems do this as well.

Pretty decent size tattoo. It cost less than a bracelet. There is really no mistaking what it is for. All people I have ever met in the medical field get it but randos at the grocery store ask if I am a nurse. It is the best 65$ I have ever spent. I have Factor 7 Deficiency which is rare so I had gotten a custom made bracelet. That cost 80$. I would honestly check with EMS to see if a tattoo would qualify as a means of treatment or notification of medical issues. We had a family member with DNR tattooed on them, and EMS would still have to use life saving procedures on them. Tattoo did not qualify as an official statement. I have friends that are firefighters and paramedics. They have told me it is a good thing to have this just as it is good for a diabetic to wear a bracelet. If I am in an accident and I am unconscious, this tattoo is my voice just as much as a bracelet would be. Sweet tattoo but factor 7 deficiency? You are like some kind of unfortunate unicorn. I have never heard of a factor 7 before. Factor 7 is weird. I can only have it if both my parents carry the gene for it. I have it genetically rather than acquired. I cannot find ANYONE else in my family who has this or any record of anyone with bleeding disorders up the line. I really am a unicorn. That is crazy, do you mind if I ask what your treatments are like? Do they make factor 7 recombinant? There is a factor 7 recombinant called novo7. I do not have it severe enough to need to factor up. If I were to have a major surgery, it is available to me. Usually if anything I need fresh frozen plasma. But cool thing is if I am pregnant, my factor levels boost really high so I do not have to worry which is great cuz I have had 2 c sections. I am done having kids though so now my \u201ctreatment\u201d consists of not getting hurt. Had to quit softball and skateboarding. That sucks. Recently I unfortunately was in a wrong place wrong time situation that resulted in a fight. I busted my knee up so bad. I was down and out for a few weeks. Injuries are always worse when you are a bleeder. Luckily the bleeding was under control in a matter of hours so I did not need to go to the er.

I am the only hemophiliac in my family, too, and luckily, since I had boys, it stops with me. I have never thought of that. Hmm.... Mine corrected during pregnancy too! So crazy!  It also stayed corrected while I was breastfeeding, so my hematologist told me I could get my tonsils out without worry as long as I continued breastfeeding. That is so rad! I actually found out I had fviid when I was getting my tonsils out. I was 22 and had already had 1 c section. Crazy stuff Sweet! Thought it was a Red Hot Chili Peppers tattoo at first. Haha! Yes! I love it! It does look a lot like a chili peppers logo Where i live it would not have  any means. They must check the background no matter what if anything happens.

Looks good.", "mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle Therapy for Hemophilia Type A  I know that this pandemic has been a terrible experience for many, My heart goes out to all the families who have lost love ones. If you needed to find some silver lining in all of this it could easily be that Covid-19 has functioned as an absolute proving ground for mRNA based Vaccination. The technology behind mRNA Vaccines has been under development for about 30 years. We in the public have not heard much because substantial hurdles existed to getting it to work safely. Thanks to the urgent need for a vaccine and the pressure of Covid-19 mRNA technology has been fully brought into the world. It stands poised to be an unmitigated game changer in the treatment of many MANY diseases. Trials are already under for a promising HIV vaccine and some success has even been seen in coding mRNA to teach the body to eradicate melanoma. Now there is a trial for an mRNA Therapy for Hemophilia Type A. It would not require recombinants. And it would not be an antibody based sort of trick like Hemlibra. mRNA LNP therapy injection could cause your own cells to spontaneously produce Factor VIII on their own! In addition to the well-stated above, I think the cooperation we have seen by pharma in the fight against Covid could bear fruit in other treatments as well.  As recently reported (WSJ, March 15, 2021), \"Gilead and Merck Join Forces to Develop Long-Acting HIV Treatment: Rival drugmakers agreed to collaborate on an HIV drug cocktail that could be taken every several months rather than once a day\". ABSOLUTELY! I was reading an article about the Covid-19 vaccine itself and it included comments from several of the men and women involved in the initial development of mRNA technology as a whole, and also the Covid-19 vaccine research that occured worldwide. That was one of the things mentioned. That absolutely key among the reasons it was done so quickly was because of positively unheard of level of communication and cooperation. Researchers were trying techniques and making breakthroughs and then sharing that info over zoom calls before they even had a chance to publish a paper on it themselves. Rival companies were freely publishing proprietary information regarding test variants and their efficacy. China, for their part, kicked the whole thing off by openly publishing the complete sequenced genome for the virus to the web for consumption by any interested party, no strings attached. It is inspire to see what we can accomplish when we work as a species, and not as individual religions, ethnicities, nations, or cultures. The development of the covid-19 vaccine should honestly stand as a strong testament to what can be accomplished when the best of us act together as one. Whether or not that lasts however... Well, certainly not at the rate it was... But how much stays remains to be seen. *fingers crossed* Got a tear on my eye while reading this. Beautiful. &gt;&gt;&gt; mRNA LNP therapy injection could cause your own cells to spontaneously produce Factor VIII on their own\n\nHow? That Is'd be pseudo-Genetic engineering. I do not get it Cells make proteins. Think of mRNA like a print file for a 3D printer. It is basically an instruction set and your cells are the 3D printer. mRNA enters your cells, your cells \"read\" the mRNA instructions and produce the protein encoded in the mRNA. Once produced your cells deconstruct the mRNA and it is gone. The thing in all of this is that theoretically the protein can be ANY protein. If that protein happens to be a foreign one (like the coronavirus spike protein) then the suddenly high number of foreign proteins triggers an immune response. That is why the vaccines work the way they do. And why it was produced so fast. All they basically had to do was plug in the specific protein from the virus and actually test the mechanisms they have been developing for 25 years. Boom. \n\nIf however the mRNA produces a protein the body can use well then... it uses it. They are already trialing treatments for cystic fibrosis which is a disease involving a protein in your body. Thing here though is that clotting factors are just proteins. All of them. So the same process should be possible for us. As mRNA is broken down by the cells after transcription it would not be permanent. But it would be possible for it to work with every kind of factor deficiency. Not just type a hemophilia like a Hemlibra. It would likely take the form of a subqutaneous or possibly intramuscular shot similar to the vaccine. There would be things to work out for sure, like how long you would maintain an acceptable level and how often to dose. Hurdles exist. But it has serious potential for not just us but many many others. The effectiveness is only until the mRNA degrades (I am a bachelor of engineering in biotechnology, I know the technical jargon). I have just studied this in my last semester. One thing I was not taught was how long it lives after being transcripted. I think most only live to get transcripted once. Once they are gone our cells cannot make factors again. I was elated when you said 'your own cells can produce it' or something along the line and I was thinking on lines of more permanent cure like a one shot affair.  But turns out my suspicions were true. I am sad :( Sadly you are correct. As I understand it transcription is a one and done. But there are good upshots to this kind of therapy though. Hemlibra is not the same thing as an actual factor replacement. It has its limits. Also, because of the somewhat ridiculously complicated and expensive way in which our recombinants are currently made they are absurdly expensive. It is at least possible that an mRNA based treatments could be both easier and vastly cheaper to produce. One of the early things discovered about mRNA technology was that genuine mRNA causes violent immune responses. Only the synthetic stuff will do! Fortunately that is also cheaper to make. We could potentially reduce the cost of therapy by an order of magnitude. Still though, there is much more to learn about. New science. Brave new world. All that uplifting stuff. Lol\n\nEdit: completely forgot to add that while there is Hemlibra for Type A... There is no equivalent for any other types of Hemophilia. All our brothers and sisters are still stuck with traditional recombinants, their costs, and inhibitors. I would say it is at least a possibility that proteins made on our own cells either do not induce inhibitors to be made, or do not respond to those inhibitors the way recombinants do.", "I have mild haemophilia and I want to get a tattoo. Does anyone have any advice if you have tattoos and/or have haemophilia as I am not sure on the procedures I would have to go through in order to get one.

We all have things we would like to change but nothing particularly bad is happening in my life.  \n\nI am currently experiencing this again and am wondering if it is connected with my experiences as a hemophiliac.   I feel one of the largest hurdles for us is that we always feel like we are out of control.   Maybe we learned some sort of weird coping mechanisms for this when we were young, and have internalized something the average joe would not.\n\nIt is frustrating to know you can just go on a road trip, or be spontaneous at the drop of a hat.  We have a metaphorical ball and chain attached to us, but to the world, it appears we are normal.  And most likely, to some part of our brain, we know we are normal, but then our conscious has to be like \"No dude....  You cannot do this because X.   Or Should I say VIII or IX.\"  \n\nBut, if life has taught me much, is that depression is a very real, and very difficult thing in the winter when we are not getting enough sun, and forced indoors more than usual.     And to stray to a different tangent, I know for me, having a good girl along on the ride is one of the best things.   That is probably true for everyone - maybe moreso for us, because we do require additional help.  I am 23, have von Willebrand Disease, and YES. My anxiety is primarily social, and is certainly bound up in other mental illness factors, but a large part of it is that I just feel like people look at me and see a weirdo. I feel like people can just see that there is something strange and repulsive about me, even when I look totally normal or even attractive. I find it very hard to develop relationships of any kind because I know it will come up eventually that I have a bleeding disorder and it will be a whole thing. Thank you for the both your response and the one below.  \n\nIts nice to hear that others feel the same thing.  You perfectly describe what I am experiencing.  It feels like things are racing out of control.  \n\nI also agree that a strong, real relationship is probably the best medicine.  I am currently single for the first time in a while and that may be playing a role.  \n\n I know that feeling.  You will find that generally if you reveal your bleeding disorder after the relationship is established that people do not really care.  \n\nI have had bad experiences when I reveal it too early.  But when it is revealed naturally, without drama, after the relationship has some foundation it is not really a problem.  I am 28 M and have von willebrand disease. I get anxiety sometimes. It is mostly financial anxiety. Here in India there is no healthcare coverage and every time something happens I become more worried about the bills than my health. \n\nThere is also lack of awareness in this part of the world and social interactions can be frustrating. On January'17 I was hospitalized for 4 days for a dental surgery and I had to take off from work. And it was awkward coming back to work because most co-workers probe questions like 'why did took 4 days off for dental surgery?' or 'Is there any other reason you took off?'. I will later awkwardly reveal my disorder. These kind of social situations makes me really angry. But I am used to it now and able to handle these situations better now.  I am really sorry to hear that you deal with that, dude.\n\nHopefully we can be a helpful outlet on this board.    Thanks! I hope so.

FWIW, I am a guy and not a doctor ---\n\nYou will definitely need a few rounds of factor to build up a proper amount in your system. probably even before going to the hospital for birthing.\n\nYou **FOR SURE** need to call the hospital and speak with their Hematologist (which might be an oncologist) and make sure that the hospital also has more factor at the ready, which usually is not available in smaller cities/towns. \n\nIf you live in or near a major city please reach out to a Hemophilia center !!! There are people who know far far more about all this and will gladly help you, even if finances are tight! You may be denied an epidural (if that is something you would want) so start the conversation now about that decision if applicable. \n\nAlso post partum you may end up factor infusing every 12 hours for 2-3 week to prevent post partum hemorrhage.  If you do not know how to self infuse, call your insurance to inquire about getting a home Health nurse to help with those post partum infusions. A picc line at home would not be realistic while caring for a newborn (been there, tried that) \n\nSource: I am a severe von willebrands patient (factor levels usually around 8-9 and did not rise in pregnancy).

If you want to birth naturally (ie not being Induced for a vaginal and not getting a c section) then you may need to prophy toward the end of your 3rd trimester. \nWhen I am pregnant I prophy infuse 3 times a week. Oh Jesus, completely forgot I might not be able to get an epidural.....fml.  I do not know if I can give natural birth without one, lol. Well it is what it is. I was really shocked when I found out. But it is way too dangerous for people like me. You are not as severe as me so you may have a different experience Seems like a nightmare. I might opt for a C section lol.  My mom did natural birth (no drugs) and it took over 36 hours..... I am a guy, so do not know specifically about pregnancy, but I would call the hemophilia clinic in your area to get full information about what you need.\nCongrats on becoming a mom That is a decision to make with your doctor. There are significant risks to baby by using general anesthesia so not a decision to make lightly. I would have chosen vaginal birth if it was possible but I was in ICU fighting for my life so C section was the only viable option available. \n\nI wish you and your baby a healthy and safe delivery \ud83d\udc9c Definitely time to have a serious talk with your OB, hematologist, and anesthesiologist.  Everyone needs to be in on a coordinated plan.  For me this meant scheduled induction, hospital had factor and ffp and blood ready to go and I had two IVs, we were also pre-registered and prepared in case we needed to transfer to the much bigger teaching hospital with a major hematology treatment ward 45 minutes away.  \n\nI was allowed an epidural both births but I have a weird one (severe VWD and hemophilia C) and they decided keeping me comfortable for a natural birth was lower risk than a surgical option.

Is there a study or some research on what is the impact of giving the patient to reach more than 100% level?\n\nIt would be completely pointless in terms of effectiveness, but I have no idea on the potential negative effect. OFF\\-ENDING? I... Do not know what that means, can you break it down a bit please Death Ah got ya, guess I am a bit slow today. I am easy to catch :) You would form blood clots in your blood vessels.   From excess factor? Our body just decides to form a clot with extra factor 8? (Well in my case) Decides is an awkward word for it but yeah, too much extra factor would cause excessive clotting.  \nReally simplified, the clotting cascade involves positive feedback so introducing excessive factor amplifies the cascade to create a clot where it should not.\n\n\nThis is why factor is not given to normal people since it will cause strokes and heart attacks from blood vessels being blocked.   Guess the right word is triggered?\n\nThanks for the simplified answer! I have herd of some \u201coverdosing\u201d and getting blood clots, however if I remember correctly they had an inhibitor was on an inhibitor product and infusing a separate factor 8 at the same time at way beyond the prescribed amount because they had an active bleed.  clotting, but anything severe would happen from prolonged levels over 100%. It has been an adverse reaction from some gene therapies. Clotting in the brain could cause death. If you overdosed once or twice I doubt there would be any problems, you will metabolize it.  I figured overdosing couple of times would not be a major issue, since it was not really stressed at all.\n\nThanks for clarifying, how is raising a kid while constantly have to convince him that you need to stick a needle in him? link? So it depends on how much and for how long.  If you were to have surgery as a normal person and we were to measure your factor 8 levels pre and post op, we would find that a normal person would go from 100&amp;#37; pre\\-op to 180\\-200&amp;#37; post op, then go back down.  This is thought to be part of the wound healing process by which clot gets laid down fast and lots of fibrin strands act as ladders for WBC to enter the wound and clean it up.  \n\nIf you were to transiently bump to 150&amp;#37; of normal, not much would happen(other than your drug bill would be HUGE and your insurance company would happily decline to cover it.)  If you did that all the time, you would have an increased risk for stroke or other less than healthy blood clots. Spontaneous clotting, I would think.\n\nThere have been a couple times when I was younger where I was infusing for the first times and I pulled back a lot of blood in to the syringe, and took forever to push it. This resulted in some of that blood clotting, and it became harder and harder to push the factor, blocked by a red gooey mess.", "Can a mild hemophiliac give birth to a severe hemophiliac? How does the gene expression work? Dad is mild hemophiliac (levels around 10 for factor VIII).  I (daughter) am also a mild hemophiliac (levels around 20 for factor VIII).  \n\nIf I have a son and I give him the X chromosome with hemophilia, could he end up having severe hemophilia? I assume yes, but was not sure. (\n\nI think the article says that in women the gene is recessive. Please ask a doctor what the odds are for the gene in sons. Is it as high as fifty percent because it is not or rarely expressed in girls? The gene in your father codes for mild. Passed to you as mild. Passed to your child as mild. It would be a one in a billion chance he could have a seperate spontaneous mutation which could code to create another mutation resulting in severe.\n\nIf the gene in your father was severe it could pass to you who has a \"compensating x\" as mild and then pass to your son as a severe.\n\n\nhope that helps My grandpa passed along his vWD gene to both my mom and one of my Uncles. In turn, my sister and I both inherited it from our mom, which is odd since it should be recessive. However, our hemotologist's theory was that it had something to do with blood type, since we both inherited our mom's blood type rather than our non-hemophiliac dad's. Males have XY chromosomes and hemophilia is X-linked and is recessive.  Assuming that I have Xx chromosomes (in other words, hemophilia on the smaller \"x\" chromosome), then my son has a 50% chance of having hemophilia. This is because there is a 50% chance I give him my \"X\" chromosome without hemophilia, and 50% chance I give him my \"x\" chromosome with hemophilia.  However, the percentage my son will have hemophilia becomes 100% if I have xx chromosomes that both have hemophilia.\n\nHowever, it is unclear to me how it is determined whether someone is a severe v. mild hemophiliac.  That might be determined by genes (as opposed to the x chromosome, which contains the genes).\n\nFor example, both my sister and I are technically considered mild hemophiliacs because we inherited the \"x\" chromosome with hemophilia from our father, but her factor VIII levels are normally at 40, whereas mine are typically at 20. Interesting, thanks. Yes that does help.\n\nI was just wondering because my sister and I both inherited mild hemophilia from our father, but her factor levels are normally twice as high as mine (she tests at 40 whereas I test at 20).\n\nWe have different mothers though, so perhaps the X chromosome I received from my mother is inactive. (I also have no idea if my mother is a hemophiliac as she has never been tested.)  Might be due to something called X chromosome inactivation.  Very interesting read.\n\n(\n\n( as far as I understand, there are many mutations that cause hemophilia and some are more likely to be severe others are not. My dad was a severe and my sister and I both got mild hemophilia from him. My nephew is a moderate. My mom is mild, somehow I am severe. What is even more fucked is that she was the first in the family to have it and she had no idea she even had hemophilia up until I was born.\n\nSo yeah, I would say it is possible.

I need to know these things. \n\nMe: what things? \n\nDr: the fact that you have been anemic for a year!\n\nMe: I have been anemic for a year?!?!??! \n\nBlood clinic rarely calls to tell us results. Once about four years ago the clinic doctor mentioned I had low iron but they needed more tests, and then never called with the results. But now a lot of my problems are making sense. I am a symptomatic carrier and I have been in and out of the hospital about six times in the past two years with horrible \"mystery illnesses\" and within doing my research I have found out about %75 of my issues stem from my apparent anemia. Do anemia and hemophilia go hand in hand? If you are a woman with a bleeding disorder, it is very likely that you will become anemic at some point. Menstrual bleeding or any type of mucosal bleeding will be a bit harder to manage. If they have diagnosed you as a symptomatic carrier, that usually means you have mild hemophilia. I am not a doctor, but I do have severe vWD. Take a look at ( and see what other solutions there are. This.  If you have heavy menstrual bleeding, that can definitely cause anemia.  It does not even need to be excessive but since it is constant month after month, your body cannot recover fast enough.  Most male hemophiliac would not have this problem as the bleeding is very localized and contained within joints and muscles. Joints do not hold much blood.\nAlthough that being said I once needed 3 units of blood for a bleed I had in my abdomen.  I had lost so much blood volume that I was actually going into shock when I stood up and my RBC count was so low. \\+1 to what the other folks said - this is extremely common with female hemophiliacs.

Do you have any links to Youtube videos for routines suitable for severe haemophiliacs? Not on hand, but I am doing traditional lifting if that is of any worth Nope. No idea what that is. I have seen photos of ripped haemophiliacs and wonder how they get that way. The most I have done is lift those 4kg dumb bells up and down. Hey Bryan! I am also a A severe here, 24 years old. Ive been doing weightlifting/gym for quite a long time now (closing in on 10 years). Ive delt with alot of different bleedings/injuries and would happily give any of you any advice if you would like.   \n\n\nI still believe that weightlifting/fitness is one of the greatest contributors to staying injury free and keeping my joints as healthy as possible. So its a good thing all around for us :) This is so inspiring for me!  I have never thought about the connection that increased muscle mass could actually protect the joints. That is a lightbulb moment for me. \n\nAre there any exercises/movements you avoid? I try to avoid jumping because I am still recovering from knee bleeds but things like lunges/squats work pretty well \n\n(Full disclosure: I am a severe type 3 von willebrands patients so similar lifestyle to you guys but not a hemophiliac myself. I am also a 35 year old female so I for sure cannot keep up with you young guys!) I have been power lifting for just under three years with Haemophilia A and I have not really came across any issues so far.\n\nThe one adjustment I make when lifting is when bench pressing I put the pad that people use for their hips/shoulders so that if it ever contacts my chest in a less controlled way it is cushioned. (Had a few bleeds from that and it throws off your bench for a long time.)\n\nDeadlift no issues, long socks or trousers help with shin scraping but I have personally never found it a problem.\n\nSquatting again no issues. Someone a little more serious than me might use the pad for their shoulders but you will have to just see how it goes. \n\n\nBasically from personal experience aslong as nothing is bumping into or bouncing off me it is been fine That is a good revelation! I think the extra musclemass would help, as well as the added mobility you get by forcing certain positions (ancles and knees).  \nI would say that the best exercises are by far the big compound movements, like squats, overheadpress, deadlifts, bench, rows etc. And avoid exercises that involve direct impacts, like the clean and the snatch. Jumping and running has produced some stress for my ankles. Also fighting sports has unfortunately been off limits for me, due to increased bleedings.. Can we have tattoos? Yeah I had no special challenges when getting my tattoo! It was not that big, so that might be a factor. Did not bleed particularily much, so did not effect the ink at all. Took a shot right before starting, and worked fine! Talk to the tattoo artist first tho", "Getting Nails Done I (VWB type 1) get my nails done with s&amp;s, which they use a drill to get off. Unfortunately despite my warning sometimes I get cut, does anyone else do this? What do you say to your nail techs? I try not to overshare but sometimes I feel like I do not share enough..", "NSFW Random brushing on back of legs? I sit a lot could it be that?  Could be my son had similar bruising after a flight.  Do you sit with your legs crossed or with your feet tucked under? If the seats are a little taller than me, yeah, my back of thighs bleed too  It looks like your factor is not giving you the protection you need any more.  I would encourage you to speak with your HTC about a test dose response. Maybe time to switch products or dosages. Good luck! It could happen from thet for sure, I have had similar stuff happen when I forget to shoot up. If it keeps happening might want to think about upping your dosage if you are on prophylactic treatment. Huh, my legs just always look like that. I agree with you.  This is normal for me, too. I would you are having spontaneous bleeds like that, I would ask your doc about getting on a prophylactic treatment. If you are on one and it is too hard to maintain or not effective, check out a long-lasting med.\n\nI started hemlibra two months ago after struggling to follow my prophylaxis on advate and I am not having any spontaneous or breakthrough bleeding at all. Hem A &lt;1% btw.", "Wisdom teeth removal while on henlibra So I am prepping for my wisdom tooth removal I am a hemophiliac type A severe with an  in&amp; active inhibitor while on hemlibra and was hoping to ask if anyone has had any dental  procedures while on hemlibra and what they are experience was like did anyone take any low doses over factor to prevent a bleed or etc... I am on Hemlibra and I would not trust it alone to cover me for wisdom teeth. I do not know how having an inhibitor might complicate things, but do me, I would just infuse as if I am not taking hemlibra. But I know your inhibitor might complicate that depending on what factor your using. See that is what I thought too I know for any procedure and overall worst case scenario would to be low doses of factor 8 for me but since I am on hemlibra I have not the need for it I have it as for a incase i have a bleed but when it comes to dental procedures I heard that used plasma or some crazy voodoo shit to prevent a bleed but idk I am not an oral surgeon I have done root canal and wisdom teeth removel on hemlibra. It has gone without hitch. No need to infuse extra factor, just inform your dentist of Hemophilia. And do not infuse factor on hemlibra without your hemotoligist approvel. Since I do not have an inhibitor and just use alphanate for bleeds (on top of Hemlibra I would I need it) all I would do is a regular infusion before the procedure, then I would do factor every 12 hours for a fee days. But I can take factor on top of Hemlibra because I do not use fiba or whatever people with bad inhibitors use. Fiba and Hemlibra are a dangerous combo because you run the risk of overclotting. But if you use regular factor for bleeds, just treat true oral surgery like a bad bleed that you know is coming. Treat before and after like you normally would. It should be fine. I am not a doctor, just a Hemo who has dealt with this a lot. So you might want to talk to a treatment center dr and make sure that you will not over clot somehow. But if you use a regular factor 8 product you should not. Just do not think Hemlibra will do much because it probably will not. For your information, there are people here on this sub, who have done major surgery on hemlibra without extra factor infusion. it works wonders. Some links you might find useful: \n\n(\n\n( (On the left side of the page click on \"Patient management\" then \"Surgeries and procedures\".)\n\n( That is great. I just know that for some of us on it , it only helps so much. Everyone is different. I am glad to hear it has worked so well for you tho! What major surgery did you have? My right ankle fusion And they did not give you factor? That seems almost negligent. I am not trying to be a jerk, I was just sure that for most any surgery they should raise your factor level to at least 100%. I am glad it worked for you. Febia was there for emergency, but due to regular hemlibra usage factor level was already at 60-70 %. And ask anyone regular user of hemlibra it is much better that factor and febia. Oh I see. You have an inhibitor. That makes more sense then. I am on Hemlibra but do not have an inhibitor so I can use factor on top of Hemlibra for bad bleeds without fear of overclotting. Yea I know it is a tricky thing to use fiba with Hemlibra, or at all. So Hemlibra must have really been a game changer for you then. I did this in February (no inhibitor, otherwise same as you) and my hospital had me dose up on Adynovate before the removal and I think maybe the day after just to be safe as well as the day I came back to have my stitches removed. Everything was fine, healing went shockingly quickly. As always, have a conversation with your HTC before any moderate or major medical procedures. I imagine they will have you take a lowish dose of factor before hand and give you amacar or something similar to slow the enzymes in your saliva that tend to break down blood clots. You should not have any issues with a treatment plan like that.", "all swelling I find myself in that intellectual rabbit hole of wondering if all swelling is exacerbated by hemophilia and not just bleeds.  Like sinusitis and bloat.\n\nAnyone else ever go down that rabbit hole? Any swelling that causes blood vessels , capillaries , stuff like that to bleed needs the clotting cascade to have all of the factors to form. Other things cause swelling though. Water, allergens, whatever, lots off stuff. Our bodies are so complicated. But I bet a lot more swollen things than most doctors would think can be made worse because of hemophilia, but only in the sense that bleeding is exacerbated by other swelling. So when in doubt do a shot. Is that the rabbit hole of which you speak? Or something different? nope.  that is the one.  I just hate sticking needles in my arm and would rather think about god death and infinity to avoid it.   I will stop procrastinating as I am far enough behind on my last prophy that my next one is timely. I hear you. Do it man! Just get it over with. I have been around long enough to have learned that it only gets worse and I end up needing to infuse way more when I procrastinate. But yea I hate doing shots. I was having to do every day for a really long time, years, and I was about to crack- then Hemlibra came along. It is super easy and once a week. And zero bleeds, unless I really get hurt, which I have, and then I just infuse like normal, with no risk of overclotting because the two products have a different mechanism. It is amazing. I think I remember reading that you are moderate, right? I bet Hemlibra will eventually be ok\u2019d for all hemophiliacs soon. I hope so anyway. \nAnd hey, I recorded a cool song last night. Not done with it yet but you might dig it. I will be switching to Hemlibra by December.  Totally interested in hearing that song when you get it to a place to share That is great. Hemlibra is awesome", "HemLibra Panacea? Id like to share my journey with HemLibra. \n\nBrief autobiography, I was born in 1990 in Brazil, diagnosed with Severe Hemophilia A at 6 months old. I have tried cryoprecipitate, recombinant, etc. Moved to Madrid ,Spain 1995 introduced to FEIBA. Cant remember when I was told I had inhibitors. 2000 Arthrodesis on my left knee due to infection (unknown source) had multiple synovectomies on knees, elbows and ankles (main target joints) moved to Athens, Greece 2002 introduced to NiaStase RT , tried Immune Tolerance worked first time, lasted about a year then inhibitors came back, tried again without success (increase inhibitors, was shit.) Moved to Montreal, Canada 2017, was not walking for a few months due to constant bleeds and muscle weakness, was told to inject less by the godfather himself Dr. G. Rivard. been using FEIBA since. \n\nMid 2019 was informed about HemLibra, stupid me tired of being the classic high profile hemophiliac  \"guinea pig\" said NO, I chose to wait some time to see how others feel about it. Covid-19 came by and delayed even more my wait, took my last dose of FEIBA on Wed Sep 16 2020, started HemLibra on that Friday and it is hard to explain the improvement that it has done to my life since, I have only taken 2 doses so far (3rd will be this Friday) and I feel like a massive weight has been taken off my shoulders and the loved ones that care for me. No more waking up in the morning feeling my body for a possible bleed, nor those daily pains all over the body, feels like fucking magic! The fact of going from injecting 100ml every other day for prophylaxis taking me 45-60min of my day to 1ml every week (eventually every 10 days) SUCUTANIOUS! is insane... have not had ANY bleedings since starting which to me feels very weird, I am used to having 1-2 bleed every month and a severe one every 2-3 months, it might be early to judge but I feel so fucking good, I feel its my duty to share this with my fellow brothers in pain. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions. \n\nRafa. I feel you bro, 21 with Severe Hemophilia here in the States and I was not so sure of switching since it seemed like dosing every day was my only option to live life until I decided to say \u201cfuck it, let us try hemlibra.\u201d Truly fucking life changing and I try to steer other hemophiliacs in this direction too. It is so amazing. Wow, I am so happy for you! I have my next check-up in a week and I really want to switch to HemLibra too. Reading experiences of others really helps and gets me excited about it. Thanks for sharing your journey with us! Absolutely life changing. I have been on it for like 7 months and it is changed my life. I still am limited in my activity because of arthritis in my ankles and knees, but t least I am not having bleeds all the time. I am 34 btw.\n\nFinally gave me the confidence to have kids too, and we are now trying. I know it can only get better but from where I am sitting, Hemlibra should be the default treatment for hemophilia. It is just too good to not use it. That is great. I am happy for you. Hemlibra has improved my life as well. I still use factor occasionally because I have been really active. This is amazing to read, I am a severe hemophiliac type A born 96, I have been considering switching to hemlibra too...the only thing that concerned me about it was the fact that it does not actually replace my factor levels in my body, but then again I am nowhere near a scientist/doctor and I do not really know the facts about it.\n\nCan you still be using factor occasionally while using hemlibra? Also how has it affected your arthritis? &gt; Can you still be using factor occasionally while using hemlibra?\n\nYes, Hemlibra is different from our traditional Factor VIII treatment therapy but they can be used together if needed.  In fact, those on Hemlibra also keep several doses of their Factor VIII medication on hand in case they experience a bleed that Hemlibra cannot handle. This is amazing to hear... we have a 4 month old who will be starting Hemlibra once he is 20lbs. We are so hopeful it prevents major joint issues for him. Just chiming in here as our baby started Hemlibra at 5 months. He is now 1 year old and we have not had any bleeds or bruises although he is been very active and taken a few spills throughout the months. I am crying as I read this. Thank you so much for sharing! I am so so happy for you and your little one! \ud83d\udc9e Hey there! Severe A hemophilia here from '85 and finally got my first dose today this morning! It did not take long to test it out because once I got home an hour later, I literally slammed my knee into a really hard marble table haha xD.\n\nIt is 9 hours later now, seeing my last dose of factor was more than two days ago I would normally will be in a lot of pain and swelling but no, it is barely bruised and I do not feel anything at all, i guess it passed the test \ud83d\ude05\n\nI feel like there is a new life coming up for all of us boizzzz.\n\nCheers from Belgium, I will bring the beers! Same to you. I feel and know we are so fortunate that we were able to start his life with Hemlibra to really help minimize the bleeds he has throughout his childhood. Our hematologist has told us some incredible stories of other young patients that are on the drug and the normalcy it is brought to their life. \n\nAnyway, feel free to reach out anytime - would be happy to help and share our experiences  with any Hemlibra or new parent hemophilia questions, as I am sure we are going through similar things with our baby boys! Yes! Our hematologist has done the same. I am so grateful for modern medicine.... I will definitely stay in touch. It is great to talk to someone in a similar situation! FEIBA and Hemlibra are not compatible, I have been given NiaStase to keep at home in case of a bleed. My arthritis is still there on those rainy days, in the past it was hard to tell sometimes if it was just arthritic pain or the start of a bleed, now I only get pain from stiffness I was on a 5.000 U FEIBA dose and was told that I could only use 200 U in case of bleed. but we chose to stick to NiaStase in case of a bleed", "Catalyst Biosciences Highlights Hemophilia Clinical Development Plans  ", "Discover Other Hemophiliacs Around You ", "Life story and more from a Portuguese 35y Hemophiliac Hi all, \n\nSorry for the next I believe so, lengthy post, but it will have a tldr in the end :)\n\nI am a guy with 35y from Lisbon, that have Severe Hemophilia A with &lt;1% Factor VIII. This has discovered in me when i was about 6/7 years old, when playing the a screwdriver in my mouth (what else you can do with it lol) i severe damaged my upper lip shaft. Went for the hospital because never stopped bleeding, was hospitalized in that time for about 2 months.\n\nThere were no blood concentrate medicines at that time, (1990 ish), so all they could do to me, it was blood transfusions.At that time of the \"world\", it was not good news for my parents, they deal with it, I believe so, the best way they can do it, but it was hard times for the next few years.\n\nHas a kid, always wanted to do \"kids stuff\", and with the glass dome that everyone handled me, it was not really good to do something \"wrong\", or to do \"kids stuff\", having family screaming \"Do not do that, Do not go that way\" and so on.  \nHad some members of my family that spread away, because of my disease, for not understanding it or with fear that could spread to them just by being with me or touching me(\"good old days\").\n\nThe few memories that i have from that time, are not good ones, I can recall missing lot's of school days going to the hospital,seeing my parents arguing the best \"way\" to deal it, going to the hospital some days about 2/3 time a day, just to take medicine or to do something that was needed. \n\nWhen older (12/13), with the conscience and way of being getting developed, i started to blame my parents for all of it, I never asked to be born with this, that were there fault all of this was happening to me. Today realize that i was just being stupid, and wanted someone to blame for all what i was going throw. For that time period, i was getting sick of going to the hospital, so started to inject myself with the medicines at home, when needed. We could say that this improved a little bit my \"life\", it gave me a new \"freedom\" that i did not had previous, but has always a downside. Started to do lots of things that could not or should not do, so had to take lots of medicine, for all my \"problems\".\n\nWhen older (20 ish), started to realize and understand that it was nobody fault, (that they are worst things in the world than this), and just had to do my life the same way that everyone does, but just with a little more careful, but sometimes still blame my parents for this and arguing with them for all of this (always when had something, going to the hospital, etc), mostly in \"stressful\" times.\n\nWhen I was (26/27), got sick with some stomach problems, and even after doing exams and everything, convinced myself that because of that had a bad disease in stomach, so bad that i convinced myself, my conscience and all within me. I started going to a down spiral, had to take some anti-depressives and relaxing pills because of that. At age of 27, got married that i still am today. It was a on/off first year of marriage because of this, because the way that got myself into. Started to try to leave the pills, that i was getting harder and harder, but got myself in a psychologist, and with a help from my parents, wife, friends and psychologist took a quite amount of time started to getting better from this and moving on with my life.  \nAfter that, had few problems that can remember (blood feces, blood urine, car crashed, and a few ones that i cannot remember) that had to be hospitalized a few days/weeks. Never needed to undertake surgery (do not like the idea to be put to sleep tbh).\n\nToday with 35y, still happily married, going to have my first child(it is a boy) in October and still do medicines to myself at home when needed. Going next month to some recent tests, to start a prophylactic myself (never did), just to leave even a pleasanter life with my kid and wife.\n\nRegarding the mental about Hemophilia, i still have issues to resolve to be complete honestly, still sometimes accuse the \"world\", that maybe need to them sorted out, but it is less and less times, so i think it is going on the right path my life. Every so often , mostly when i have some bleeding, this thoughts cross my mind, and need talk to my wife about this, how \"shitty\" is my life, and so on, other times realized that it is just the way it goes, so take it and stop complaining about it (think that some of you can relate with this or it is just me that are strange).\n\nSo, this is the end, i am here, and find out about this Reddit a little by chance, if anything needs to talk about something, please contact me, i will share my thoughts or just listen if needed.\n\ntldr: Hemophiliac with a pleasant life we can say that, still have some issues to sort out, but it is on right path!\n\nCheers guys! For\u00e7a amigo! Abra\u00e7o do Porto! Para ti Tb! Abra\u00e7o! Yea it is not just you. We all struggle with things like this, some more than others. Here in the US there are hemophilia meetings , camps for kids, men\u2019s groups and other things set up by the community. If you plan on coming to the states at any time maybe you could plan a trip during one of the national hemophilia conferences and meet other men with hemophilia. It can be really helpful to talk with people who understand. There are a lot of us. Congratulations on becoming a father, soon you will not have time to worry about yourself anyway, so there is that! Good that you are doing prophylactic infusions. I know it is a pain but in the long run you will use less medicine and be better off. Lucky you have access to factor, some of us have a hard time getting it, even here in these \u201cgreat states\u201d. So be thankful for that now at least. Take care of yourself. Cheers! Thanks for the reply, and for getting me confortable.", "NHF Medical Advisory: Koate DVI shipments on hold ", "Is your HTC pushing Helimbra on you? If so are you receiving your factor through your HTC or specialty pharmacy? I have noticed that most Helimbra patients are ppl who have SP. While ppl who order through HTC receive advate/kovaltry ect.. ?  Wow - interesting point.  It does seem to be that the push for Hemlibra is picking up... it is creating quite a controversy as many feel there needs to be more research before the push.  I do know pretty equal numbers that get factor through SP vs. HTC who are wanting or getting on it.......  It may differ from state to state??? Yea my whole thing is i wonder if htc\u2019s are pushing helimbra for ppl that get factor through SP, because the reimbursement for that medicine is alot less than say other factor .. SP get less of the cut? Idk  I will just say that factor and non-factor reimbursement is insanely complicated. Then, throw 340B in there mix too...\n\nInterestingly, the CA DHCS(AKA medi-cal/GHPP)is proposing new regular factor reimbursement rates with both HTC and SP taking a hit, but SP taking a very significant hit to their reimbursement rate. I bring it up to all my patients as I feel that I have a professional duty to offer all the options and to keep my patients and their families abreast of the current state of resarch or clinical practice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can  tell you that specialty pharmacies are very worried about this agent and the ones coming that are similar.  Factor is hugely marked up and being able to run your business profitably off one hemophilia A patient is a big motivator to worry about Hemlibra.\n\n&amp;#x200B; My son's HTC is pushing helimbra like crazy at us.  Pur specialty pharmacy wants us to use what ever product we feel the most comfortable using.\n\nI think it is a toss up on who is pushing the products heavily. A lot of women with mild Hemophilia wonder if they will be the next factor profit target - encouraging them to use more factor as the severe patients transition to drugs like hemlibra. I would personally love Hemlibra, but it is still not fully licensed here in the UK (at least last time I spoke to my HTC)  I have been on Kogenate for a long time. I started care at 2 HTC's already on it, and they were fine with me just staying with what worked. ( You are not interested in potentially one subq injection per month? I will ask about it at my upcoming HTC visit. Nobody has talked to me about it, and when I first heard about it I just though it was another Factor product to compete with others so did not look in to it much at the time.\n\nOnce a month would be great. Even once a week would be an improvement. I do hope it gives the same results of course. I am Severe but have not had a breakthrough bleed in years. I would doubt that most affected carriers would be profit targets, though they would be really easy marketing targets.  Pink Advate.  Just get the hand the rocks the cradle to shoot Pink Advate, and all you have to do is then market it in white boxes and pink ones. Almost everyone I know that is on  helimbra take it at least twice a week I do not know anyone that only takes it once a month... does the product make you feel any different knowing that it comes with a black label, stating that people have died while on helimbra What the European Commission says and what the UK does is sadly slightly different. Potentially even more so over the coming months as brexit shenanigans continue! \n\n\" Emicizumab does not currently have a marketing authorisation in the UK for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A **without** inhibitors. \" (\n\nThe decision at EU level may lead to it becoming licensed for people with haemophilia without inhibitors eventually in the UK, but it will depend on whether the NHS makes a decision (through a lengthy commissioning process) around cost/benefit in terms of affordability. The NHS is amazing, and the experience of haemophiliacs in the UK as a result is amazing (no worrying about health insurance) - however, it does position you much more as a passive consumer, where you get what you are given, rather than someone with more active agency and consumer choice within a marketised health system. Still, I would take my socialised healthcare system any day!  &gt;Almost everyone I know that is on helimbra take it at least twice a week\n\nThat is interesting, since twice a week is not one of the (\n\nI do not have any firsthand knowledge of the product, but here is more about that ( \ud83e\udd23 That is a really good question. The NHS is fairly all encompassing, and there is very little culture of 'buying' drugs here (beyond aspirin, paracetamol etc). From what I understand happens is that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) assesses new medicines in terms of safety, effectiveness, and value for money. If they approve it, the NHS is legally obligated to make it available. So effectively, approval comes before access if that makes sense- there is no other way to get complex drugs.\n\nThe current example of Orkambi for cystic fibrosis highlights the potential downfalls of this system though: (  Options are weekly, biweekly, or monthly. I am on monthly after being on weekly for the trial and it is a bit touch-and-go at the start, I actually have infused factor a couple times as needed (recommended by my doc) and I have been fine. Look closely at who had adverse effects with Hemlibra and how it works. People with inhibitors who were also taking high doses of feiba for longer than 24 hours had overclotting. That is a very specific set of circumstances that may or may not apply to you. \n\nThe half-life of the drug is 28 days, so the dosing is weekly, biweekly, or monthly, but the total dose over the course of the week is the same. The results for each dosing schedule was very similar in terms of bleed reduction. \n\nI completely respect wanting longer term studies before considering the drug, but it is important to not spread misinformation. What about my post is misinformation.. I personally do not know not one of my friends that takes it weekly.. my brother switched and I did not..and in regards to the black label it does come with it. Of course the people who had complications were people with inhibitors and taking other products. In my personal opinion I feel like it is just a waste of time to go ahead and take helimbra, but still need to have factor on hand for emergencies. Working in industry you hear so many rumors you do not know what to believe, supposedly treatment centers are pushing this to patients especially ones who do not order through them.. I do not know any provider or any insurer who would prescribe more than once weekly Hemlibra.  As the commenter above stated, the most frequent dosing would be once weekly.\n\nHaving a vial of standard factor concentrate while on Hemlibra is a precaution.  Many (most, really) patients on Hemlibra have few to no breakthrough bleeds and may not need the vial.  Having to infuse factor twice weekly just for prevention and with higher risk of having to infuse additional doses because of bleed or injury when you are at your trough between doses vs. having a vial on hand in the rare case of a breakthrough.  \n\nFactor prophylaxis generates peaks and troughs so that a person with severe or moderate hemophilia will still be at  a high bleeding risk in the period before their next prophylactic dose.  Someone on Hemlibra is essentially a very mild hemophiliac all the time with minimally increased bleeding risk.\n\nNot to mention babies or young children who would other require a central line because it is too difficulty to consistently get a peripheral IV.  Not having the increased infection risk is a huge benefit of Hemlibra vs. port/Broviac line.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Currently on eloctate 3x weekly for prophylaxis, our clinic is St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis TN, our last visit 6 months ago Hemlibra was pushed extremely hard, but I refused it due to the fact that they could not provide me with research data, a well defined planned for breakthrough bleeds or any other REAL data that I could look at myself, only thing that was offered was word of mouth. Hopefully next month there will be more data available and I can consider the transition to improve my son's quality of life. Any advice on it though? Type A Factor 8, severe &lt;.08%. \n\nAny info is greatly appreciated.  One concern for some doctors I have talked to though is that hemlibra will condition people not to infuse even when they have a bleed, and there may be less pressure to teach youth to self infuse. It is clearly a revolutionary treatment for those with inhibitors, but we still need to stay vigilant to protect our joints I think. ( Thank you so much!! My keyword that I did forget to mention was \"without inhibitors\" You might also want to search this subreddit for other threads about Hemlibra.  There are several people here that have first-hand experience with the product. Yeah I have seen that, I really dont know why I have not gotten involved with any of the hemophilia subreddits until now, I guess I do not really think about it until I seen a random hemophilia post, now I can say that if reddit is not good for anything else its definitely great for our hemo family! I would settle for women to actually be consistently diagnosed and have access to factor.  I doubt women will be pushed to use more than they should.  Unfortunately many treatment centers still do not acknowledge women with low factor levels actually have hemophilia.  I know several that came close to death during surgeries, needing whole blood transfusions to replace what the lost.  If they were given factor before the surgery they would not have been at risk and would have recovered much faster. Yes.  This is what many women are talking about right now.  Equal access and treatment.  It is scary how many women are not getting what they need.  I have heard similar stories... Too many.... It is terrifying.

It cleared up with FRICE treatments after about a week. \n\nCompartment syndrome typically presents in large muscle groups like your thigh or abdominal muscles. For example, each thigh is made up of three muscles compartments. If you touch each muscle compartment (i.e. muscle group) and they are soft and compressible, then you can usually rule out compartment syndrome. If the compartment is hard, painful, and immobile, then that would be concerning for compartment syndrome. \n\nI have not personally heard of chronic compartment syndrome before. I know it seems clich\u00e9 but if you are worried about it call your HTC.\n\nI have only ever had one time where my hematologist advised me to go to the ER for a bleed in my forearm to rule out compartment syndrome. I did not have it but I have had a bad elbow bleed that was pinching nerves and my whole arm down to my fingers hurt.  I was begging to have it aspirated to alleviate the pressure.  I may have threatened to do it myself.  That is is the kind of pain I associate with compartment syndrome. Not sure about chronic though?", "Swapping syringes? I am currently changing factor and the new one uses more dilutant. For the first time in a long time, I have to swap syringes. Is there a best practice to do that alone without endangering the needle in the hand? i.e. prevent it from becoming dislodged by having it hold the mouth of the butterfly tube to remove the used syringe and to plug in the other syringe?

Considering one but have not seen too much info about it on the interwebs. Get an post-op infusion plan with your hematologist. There really should not be any issues getting one if you have everything generally under control. \n\nSevere A, had one last year, went real smooth with no bleeding related issues. I had one with severe hemophilia,  just make sure you infuse 30 mins or so before and then the next day after and potentially the next to make sure you do not have internally bleeding. I had swelling and some bad brusing but it last maybe a week or so. I will let you know soon. Mine is scheduled for Friday! Ahh, forgot about the pre-op. My post-op was really aggressive, so I did not have much bruising or swelling. I would say that the procedure is 99% mental hype. \n\nActual procedure time, 20min tops, total time maybe for me was 60min from in the door to out the door. Take the Valium ride, why not, it takes the edge off, you just need someone to take you and not drive if you do. \n\nThe pain was not what I was expecting, really the only pain I experienced was the local anesthetic needle pinch, which we are kind of used to needle sting being hemos. Then the anesthetic being pushed in felt like uncomfortable pressure in the general groin then you do not feel anything down there after that. It does not feel like \u201cgetting hit down there\u201d at all.  Still alive. Really not bad. Infused 2 hours before and 24 hours later.

Hi bleeders!\n\nI was wonder if there is anyone here from Italy that could share some experience regarding being a hemophiliac there?\n\nI live in Ireland at the moment and together with my girlfriend we are thinking about moving to Italy in near/later future. \n\nFirst thing for me that I have to make sure before even thinking about that is hemophilia. Will I have the same kind of care like in Ireland/UK? Is Hemlibra available to everyone? Do you need some kind of insurance? How is everyday like in general with hemophilia there?\n\nThanks for any potential answers! Have a great weekend! Following, would like to know as well. Epico Are you an Irish citizen (or EU citizen?) if yes then it is easier. \n\nBasically it will be pretty similar. It has a licence in Italy.

Before then if you have you european health insurance card then that will cover you for emergencies. The WFH website has a list of all the HTCs in the world so you can look up where they are in Italy. \n\nYou will probably need to take a minimum of 3 months supply when you move. But your haematologist Will be able to help and also with a referral letter once you have decided where to move to. \n\nAlso  can help. \n\nMy advice would be to make sure you have a reasonable grasp of Italian before you go, English is not the universal language in medicine! \n\n(I moved to France with severe vWD, probably should have done all of the above before I moved \ud83d\ude02)", "Ever had a factor 8 assay done while on Hemlibra? Mine tipped the scales at &gt;200%.\n\nLOL!!!!   I figured something like that would happen. Interesting. (\n\n&gt; Laboratory Coagulation Test Interference\n\n&gt; HEMLIBRA affects intrinsic pathway clotting-based laboratory tests, including activated clotting time (ACT); activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); and all assays based on aPTT, such as one-stage, factor VIII (FVIII) activity. Therefore, intrinsic pathway clotting-based coagulation laboratory test results in patients who have been treated with HEMLIBRA prophylaxis should not be used to monitor HEMLIBRA activity, determine dosing for factor replacement or anti-coagulation, or measure FVIII inhibitor titers.\n \n&gt; Results affected by HEMLIBRA: aPTT; Bethesda assays (clotting-based) for FVIII inhibitor titers; one-stage, aPTT-based single-factor assays; aPTT-based Activated Protein C Resistance (APC-R); ACT.\n \n&gt; Results unaffected by HEMLIBRA: Bethesda assays (bovine chromogenic) for FVIII inhibitor titers; thrombin time (TT); one-stage, prothrombin time (PT)-based single-factor assays; chromogenic-based single-factor assays other than FVIII (see Drug Interactions for FVIII chromogenic activity assay considerations); immuno-based assays (ie, ELISA, turbidimetric methods); genetic tests of coagulation factors (eg, Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210). Yea it comes back all crazy- concerning if you were in an accident and at the ER unconscious, they would think you do not need factor. There is another way they tell if you are on Hemlibra what your actual factor levels are. I cannot remember the details tho. I guess Hemlibra only throws off the factor 8 level test, but I recently had my vwd factor level done while on Hemlibra and it came back at around 200% which seems wrong to me since I do not clot well unless I use factor with the vwd factor included (like alphanate or humate-P). But yea hopefully doctors get updated on treating people who are taking Hemlibra, because Hemlibra alone will not do much for you if you have had any real damage done.", "I finally unlocked the Modern Warfare Hemophiliac Camo! It is pretty badass imo. Thoughts?  Also, if anyone in the bleeder community enjoys video games I stream several days a week on Mixer if you ever fancy dropping in :) Disclaimer: there might be occasional to frequent bad language.\n\n( I did not know that was a thing. Cool. Haha yup I have joked to my wife that I am using this camo because that is all I am lol. I will have to drop in sometime when you are streaming. Lol yesterday, my friend sent a video of him unlocking that camp and said \u201cyooooo they put you in game\u201d LOL - That Is funny. Is the camo clotted blood? Well, maybe not clotted for us. I was a bit surprised to see it, bur agreed, it is cool. haha brilliant... I have it on most of my main weapons... regardless of the title, it is just a cool camo in general hahaha I had a similar reaction from my friend when he first unlocked it. \"Luke... you are in the game! You need to unlock yourself!\" Haha touche. So it is under the skulls section so it appears to be a lot of skulls in flames...not really that blood related. Maybe a subtle nod to joint pain :/ haha. If this is not the dumbest reference to hemophilia in a video game, it is pretty close. I also use it. Badass indeed :) Right? Is that skulls on fire? It is tough to make out. Yeah, forgive my ancient iPhone camera! I could not find a more high res pic of the camo online to unfortunately. It is skulls on fire. Someone actually posted on r/modernwarfare mentioning it did not really make sense too. I reckon the developers should have consulted with us! It is a cool camo for sure, but does not appear to have any reference to blood on it you know it! Good job it is just a video game eh! I enjoy the references. I remember you could contract \"poryphic hemophilia\" in Oblivion and essentially become a vampire haha I just found that thread lol Also, handy thing I do, is I take a snapshot, then upload to Twitter through the console, open up my phone and just download it to my phone. Takes a couple extra mins I know, but in case you did not know, and ever need a better pic, figured I would offer that up. I am now extremely embarrassed I did not think of this... completely forgetting the xbox has a screenshot feature, despite streaming on it regularly. I appreciate the tip. I will have to get a nicer photo and add it to this post Oh do not feel embarrassed lol. It is ok, there is plenty of things I do not think of. If you are used to streaming, makes sense you would not think of the screenshot feature tbh. \n\nNot really big into streaming, but wish you luck, could use some hemophilia ppl out there doing it :) The national association in Japan - or what passed for it at the time - actually released protest letters trying to get that changed. Wow. Well, I guess some people are more easily offended than others. I always like to use the opportunity of haemophilia references in pop culture as a route to raise awareness and educate people on the reality of the condition. It works as a nice in road. Here it carries the stigma of the tainted blood scandal. Patient groups in general are not nearly as open/vocal as in the US. I get the national org\u2019s newsletter, nobody\u2019s attributed with their full name, faces in photos all blurred out. That is a shame. So haemophilia in general is still strongly associated with the contaminated blood scandal, and that is why people try to be more conservative about it? Would you say there is a cultural influence on how vocal people are about their condition to? In general people with health conditions are far more private about it, so it is not just a hemophilia thing. It is absolutely a cultural issue. I thought that might be the case. I find the influence of culture on discussing health really interesting. I think there is something to being somewhat reserved in certain instances, but I am continuously seeing people on social media describe the minutiae of every health issue they encounter. I think there is a misconception building around being so explicitly open to be a good/successful advocate, which definitely is not the case haha, I have it on my AUGUST Nice! I started off loving the AUG when the game released, but following the last big updates I have gone off it...was sucking so bad and converted to the mp5. Not haemophilia related...but what attachments you running? Man, I do not even know anymore. I am awful at this crap. My last FPS I was into was CS 1.6. I have not played any FPS games since. I cannot compete with these 12 year olds hopped up on Mt Dew and Adderall. I will play now and then, but Gun Game is by far my favorite mode. I have been deep into Path of Exile these past few years. I am also a family man now, so I do not have much time at all to play. My days of 60h a week in World of Warcraft are over. haha I bet man. Priorities have changed. Totally agree regarding the 12 year olds.... my abilities cannot keep up with their drug and energy drink enhanced skills haha! Yeah, I really like gun game, and I have enjoyed the new gun fight mode. They just introduced a 3v3 mode of it so playing with my old xbox pals has been good fun. At least you will always have the WoW memories Omg i unlocked this camo on plenty of weapons and never noticed the name.\nIt is awesome!! Haha I do not play cod anymore but that is awesome ! Makes me want to play just to get it ! THERES A SKIN FOR HEMOPHILIA", "A Success Hi everyone! I thought I would take a second to share some success. I do not want to spike the football, but I feel like living with hemophilia can be real challenge -- for the patient and their families. My experience is better than many, worse than some, and I just wanted to share my experience in the hope that it gives some hope to others -- other patients, and their family members who may need some encouragement.\n\nTo start off, I am a type A severe (&lt;1%) Factor VIII hemophiliac. I am 34 and was lucky enough to avoid HIV but I did get exposed to HCV, and miraculously I have never tested positive for the virus, only antibodies. I have pretty severe arthritis in my ankles and my left knee. \n\nMy childhood was very difficult. I had to wear a helmet and elbow and knee pads until about 3rd or 4th grade to keep myself from getting injured. That was particularly tough in school. Because of my repeated injuries I ended up missing probably 70 to 90 percent of the school year up until 6th grade. \n\nI graduated high school an A-/B+ student, and went to community college. I had more health issues there, which completely derailed my academic career for about ten years. It was not all hemophilia, but it eventually included that as my repeated injuries were aggravated by working retail and standing for hours at a time on hard surfaces, and poor treatment regime (my own fault).\n\nI have felt like a loser most of my life. Whether it was because of school, or not being able to match or measure up to others physically. Partially because of hemophilia and complications from it (depression, HCV scare) I really withdrew and did not date for years. I was afraid to have children and almost had a vasectomy several times. It is a personal choice, and I think there is no right answer there -- just whatever you feel is best for yourself and your family.\n\nI was talking to my fiancee about it, and as I sit and reflect lately, I finally have what I want in life, and they are things I never thought I would have, partially or completely due to Hemophilia and I wanted to share the positive side and positive end to several dark chapters of my life thus far, hoping it gives others hope.\n\nI never quit on school. I dropped out a couple times, but never for more than a year, and I eventually got a bachelors degree. That was my ticket to a desk job. I moved out of state to work in a call center, and I turned all those hell years of retail experience into an asset, and now I have had two promotions in 2.5 years and I have a blossoming career in higher education. I never thought I would have that. I have a job that pays decently, if not handsomely; a job that does not destroy my body any more; benefits; and I can be proud of what I do. I also have my financial independence, which I never thought I would have in my life, until about 2 years ago.\n\nDating was always hard for me, but once I settled the HCV scare and learned to become more comfortable with myself, and confident since I was finally independent, I had more success in dating. I have dated for years, and been close to being engaged, but I just never found the right person, and I think it was because of a lack of confidence, and lack of being comfortable and happy with myself. I had a psychadelic experience a while back and it finally made me comfortable with who I am -- strengths and flaws. After that, I became comfortable accepting that in my 30's, maybe it is time I become comfortable with dating women who have been divorced and/or who have children already. After years of dating, I found someone amazing (the very first woman who was both married previously and has kids who I ever dated) and we are getting married tomorrow, and planning on more kids immediately since we are not getting any younger.\n\nI just spent so many years (decades) of my life without hope, merely surviving and not really living, either directly or tangentially related to reason stemming from my Hemophilia. I wanted to share this with everyone so they know for themselves and their loved ones that there is hope, and there we really all can have the lives we want to have. I will never be a police officer, astronaut, professional athlete, etc. But I can be one hell of a desk jockey. \n\nFor those of you struggling with your bleeding disorder or who have a family member who is, the biggest things I can stress to help you avoid the years of unhappiness I had and to obtain what you want the quickest are:  \n\n\n* Work an office job. Whether it is answering phones, cold-calling, or whatever, get something that will not damage your body further. Your body is not worth anyone else's profit, and do not sacrifice your joints and health for others or be shamed into doing something you know will lead to permanent damage.\n* Get an education. Learn to program, code, do digital art, or literally anything that will lead to a career that will help you have the life you want. \n* Take care of yourself. If you have to be honest and have a \"come to Jesus\" talk with your HTC about your treatment or lack of adhering to it, do it. Most of my joint damage is because I did not take care of myself by finding a better job or not treating properly. Now that I am on Hemlibra, I no longer have spontaneous bleeds. I even had a gnarly bruise two weeks ago from getting caught between a compressed mattress in the box and my wall on the stairs, and the bruise just... went away. It is amazing to know what it is like to heal.\n* Do not give up, and do not settle for less -- ever. I have heard too many sad stories about guys who have no financial independence, who have an addiction to painkillers, etc. because they are living the life I used to life, which was no life at all, but really a prison term. A sentence served in a prison of unfulfilled hopes and zero expectations. Thanks for sharing your story.\n\nThere are themes in your story that I can relate to.  I had some struggles with depression in my early 20s. I finally just accepted who I was, Hemophilia included. \n\nEducation is something I always believed in.  There were just certain jobs that were a no go for me because of my physical limitations. School was challenging at times due to missing classes bc of bleeds. Lots of schools will give special accommodation to people with medical.issues.  \n\nI stopped comparing myself to others, but the truth is that I have been more fortunate than  most people.  I have a great wife and son.  I have a great job. My body still sort of sucks but I do what I can. Man, I swear I was reading a story about myself. Spot on.", "Ideas for documentary Hey bleeders\nI am a student filmmaker trying to make documentary about living with hemophilia a. I was wondering if I can hear your stories about living with hemophilia. \nA little bit about me\n I have severe hemophilia a. O was diagnosed when I was 11 months old when I fell from stairs and got a cut in my upper lips. I was bleeding for a week because doctors could not figure it out. Being born in a third world country only few people knew about hemophilia. My family had to send my blood to Sweden to get diagnosed. My family moved to USA few years ago in order for me to get medicine properly. Because I was not getting factor back, my targeted joints started to wear off. I have major arthritis on my right knee and left ankle. Hi there.  On paper, I am severe haemophilia B, but it presents with very mild symptoms.  I apparently have had the doctors at Oxford baffled since I was diagnosed 25 years ago!  I have only ever had to have factor injections twice, and both were related to a wisdom tooth extraction I had a few years ago.  I think I have developed arthritis as well, but I had no idea it could be caused by my haemophilia.  I will have to talk about it with the physiotherapist when I go to my appointment to get them checked next week. Make a short film about an incident happening and no one knowing what to do because either A. No one knows what to do, or B. Because the person is not wearing a med ID, as a fello film student making a film about hemophilia is an interesting idea As a pediatric treater, a documentary on the role of the medical alert ID would be great.  Aim it for parents and teens.  The impact of those devices in a head injury setting can be lifesaving or life altering.  Takes very little blood to change your destiny. As a father of a severe a, a documentary including parents and how they deal with it can be interesting. \n\nMy son is 2.5 now, and he was accompanied by me or my wife whenever he was awake until 2 to see where he hits when he falls. Now he can speak and tell us where it hurts, but before that, if we would not see it, we would not be able to respond properly. \n\nThe lifestyle hemophilia pushes to the parents are demanding for sure. It is also enforces \u201chelicopter parenting\u201d and has psychological effects on the children and their relationship between the parents. \n\nHaving a documentary covering the story from both perspectives would be a must-watch for the newbies in any hemophilia community. Many women are not getting diagnosed because they think women cannot get it......", "Are you using an app to help you? Help me make one for you, for free I am an app developer and haemophilia B (severe) sufferer, with a young nephew that also suffers (unfortunately with an inhibitor).\n\nThrough my own experience with haemophilia and the experience of my sister who cares for my nephew, an app to give you and your Doctor more insight into your condition or the condition of those you care for can be really powerful. For example, my sister and Mum both provide my nephew with treatment, but they have to communicate with each other to make sure they both know when he was treated, and to make sure they both have enough treatment in stock. An app can centralize his treatments and notify each other when he is treated. And for me, an app that tells me what my estimated factor level is in real time really motivates me to treatment myself when it gets low.\n\nI want to make an app that works for me, my family and for you. And I want it to be accessible for everyone.\n\nThrough researching, I came across a few nice apps. Florio looks especially nice, but unfortunately it is locked down until your Doctor sets you up. In fact quite a few of them require your Doctor to sign up.\n\nWhat apps, if any, are you using to manage your condition or to manage the condition of someone you care for? Did you have to get set up through your Doctor? Is the app missing any features you would like to see? Hey there, I am also an app developer with severe haemophilia A and created an app which I am using since 4 years now. It does not include data sharing with your doctor but is designed for privacy as the health data is quite sensitive (at least in the EU with GDPR and stuff). Feel free to check it out:  Looks slick! Well done! Is there a particular reason why you track the geographical location of where you had the bleed to show on a map? This is actually just for fun and completely optional. I like to check all the places I have traveled (and used my factor). For iOS 14 I also added a widget, Apple Watch support and also have factor estimates and graphs. Are you an iOS developer, Android or both? Unfortunately I only stuck to iOS Great idea. In the U.K. an app is provided for us called Haemtrack. It is fairly basic allowing the logging of treatment for staff to see. It also shows the nearest haemophilia centre based on location, though I have never had to use this feature. \n\nWe are very fortunate over here. Very cool! I have been using React Native since I come from a web background, so I will be able to run it on Android too. I will run into some issues working with native code if I ever get as far as you have and develop a widget + Apple Watch support. Thanks for the info! I remember Haemotrack from when I was living in the UK. It was fairly basic like you said, but it did the job for tracking the essentials. I would completely forgotten about the nearest haemophilia center based on your location. That would be a useful feature to include. Thank you! I use and love the bleeder app. My favorite part is being able to track my current factor level estimate to known if I am safe doing certain activities. Just started using MicroHealth. I like the fact I can scan the barcodes on Eloctate and it populates the dose and lot. Also has options to share with my HTC. In Canada - I use MyPKFiT. It is okay, I can log infusions and bleeds and can track factor levels. I wish it had functionality with my Apple Watch so I could check my factor levels on my wrist lol. I work as a QA (still junior, mostly manual testing), if you need any help with testing, let me know. Thanks mate! Much appreciated \ud83d\ude0a Thanks for sharing! I will take a look at Bleeder for inspiration Sharing with your HTC is interesting! Thanks for passing that along. That functionality would be super nice! Agreed! Was told to use Zero Bleeds. It auto uploads all infusion and bleeding data with photos to my Haematology Centre at the hospital. It is better to sync the data to them as they can monitor and see if there are any target joints developing; something working adults may not be paying attention to due to work. Prior to this was some propriety hardware and software solution that was used for a trial. That one scanned the barcodes of the trial medicine infused which is overkill for day to day use since they had to account for every vial.\n\nAs for estimated level, it is quite simple for Haemophilia A using traditional Factor VIII. Just half it every 12 hourly. So if I infuse 80% at noon, I will have 40% left at midnight and 20% left at noon the next day.\n\nWhen I was on the pegylated Factor trial, the half life was 20 hours, so a rough estimate would be when I infuse 80% at noon, I will have 40% left at noon the next day.\n\nNone of the above is exact due to consumption. But at the very least, it is a working number if your aim is to maintain factor at a certain level. So if I had to maintain 80% in both cases, I will have to jab 40% every 12 hourly, whereas in the latter, it will be an additional 40% every day.\n\nYou probably want to find out the half life of the Factor that your nephew is using. hi sargentv, is your hemlibra trial extended ? Yeah for 1 year just 1 question.\n\nI am curious to know whether this trial from roche or indian government.\n\nis it is from government then we get hope for future.\n\ndo you know whether it is from grug company (roche) or indian governament ?", "9 weeks post ankle fusion. 7 weeks clean from all pain meds.  Congrats! May I ask how did you life change, outside of pain meds etc? I have been offered to do ankle fusion in the past, and while i was always up to any threatment methods, I have to say ankle fusions scares the shit out of me. I am looking at possibly needing an ankle fusion soon and I am extremely curios what life is like after. My main worry is still being able to drive as for me it is my right ankle that is bad and I really could not live without the freedom of driving myself.\n\nHow has life been since if you do not mind me asking? What does it mean. Can you still move and walk normally? Or is it stiff? Like no movements up/down/side? Be careful. They are known to fail. Its impossible to fuse good bone to dead bone. I had and ankle replacement. STAR ankle, best thing I ever did. Not pain and full mobility. GL Please look into ankle replacement surgery. I had one done last February. Best thing ever. I had the STAR ankle by Stryker. It was done by Dr Paul Cooper @ Georgetown Medical in Washington DC. He is done 800 ankle replacement surgeries and out of those 160ish have been us hemophiliacs. Any questions please reach out. Any idea how long your new ankle is good for? Good to see you went the same route as I did. For those wondering, it IS life changing. Its been over a year for me since my ankle arthroscopy/fusion. My ankles still hurt time to time but the pain is 1/10 which is more than bearable. You will be able to walk soon. Keep stretching while you are in bed, slowly but surely and remember take your factor as directed. Have a healthy recovery :) How long do you have to keep weight off of it? How has your replacement been? Can you run or hike? I cant run because of a knee replacement. But I could if i did not have that. I hike, hunt and bike all the time. I was could not stand still for more then a few minutes without the ankle killing me. I also could not walk far. I was trapped in a catch 22. I hate sitting still. Its been wonderful, no pain anymore. My ankle locked up ill the time. If I did to much during the day I would not be able to get off the couch once I did sit down. 10/15 years. Even if you wear it out, its a simple procedure. They cut you back open, take out the middle part, put a new one in and sew you back up. The STAR is a not glue, no rod up your bone replacement. \n Thanks for the link.  How did you find this surgeon?  Were you a patient at Georgetown HTC? Youre welcome. I found him through a hemophiliac FB group. Asking questions about a fusion and many people said he was the best and has done their ankles. Im in Rhode Island. It was a lot going back and forth but total worth it. Also as an fyi, Im 41 with serve A. I am local to DC but have not been a patient of the Georgetown HTC for about 20 years.  I was not a fan. Congratulations! Glad to hear that helped you stop pain meds \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd I feel that an ankle replacement is better. I know 100s of us that have had it done. I also know 100s that have had fusions. Most of not all have had issues and wished they knew about the replacement. May I ask how old you are? It is been a couple years since I talked to an ortho surgeon about my ankles, but at the time they said I was still too young to get one (around 28 at the time i think) since I would need a new replacements every decade or so and there is only so many they can do over a lifetime. So my understanding is that they essentially put a couple screws in going from the bones in your leg into the bones in your foot, completely immobilizing your ankle. Over time the bones just all fuse together in there since there is no more movement in the joint. That obviously makes walking harder, but it eliminates the risk of bleeds and arthritis pain, which is the point of the procedure. But the cool part is that over time and with walking and physical therapy, the bones and joints in your foot start to loosen up and you end up being able to move your foot around a bit through the metatarsals rather than your ankle. That is how it was explained to me anyway. Im 41. Had my ankle done last year. Had my knee done at 24. Knee is getting old. Few more years and ill get it fixed. The new ankle is easy to fix. Its one piece that can wear out. It puts a ton of pressure on your foot bones though. Wish I knew about replacement for the loss of motion, but other than that my fusion has presented zero problems and its been close to 15 years now. Absolutely no pain, and surprisingly less loss of motion then what I expected - but it is still some loss. Cannot do calf raises without feeling like my foot is doing 90% of the work. \n\nMaybe it is because I was about 23 when I got the fusion that it took so well. Either way though, definitely going to ask about replacement for my right ankle - they are talking about fusion and I am starting to think it is time. Best decision I ever made. I am around 5 years out from one ankle and 8 out from the other. Zero pain and way more mobile than I was before. \n\nThe pain only lasted a couple of months, as far as I recall,  and I could not be happier. As someone who is had both fused, driving is no issue at all. In fact, it is easier, as there is no pain in my feet anymore. My foot tends to hover off the floor of the car when i drive, though, as I do not have that flexibility in the joint. I have had no issues with this. foot flexibility is better than pre-fusion, as arthritis and pain were limiting movement anyway. Made the mistake of doing arthscopy type surgery on my second ankle, I wish I would have e got it fused like the first one. The recovery time is longer for this stupid thing and im still having pain almost 6 months post op. I was ok after le 4 for my fusion I drive 3 hoirs a day sometime for work and my right ankle is fused. No problems at all I walk perfectly fine and decent flexion up and down in my joint. Best thing ever No issues with fusion and replacments only last lime 10 years for younger people You did not like Dr Kessler or was he not there? He is a great Dr and the relationship with Ortho is great. The HTC down there is way be that then mine. I \"should\" get surgery and i am very scared about it.. Yeah I was the same. I was meant to have the surgery in 2016 but chose to delay it with pain meds and steroid injections. I am a musician and at the time had a lot of work that I did not want to pass up. Fast forward 4 years, having a kid, buying a house, a global pandemic and multiple cancelled surgeries I managed to get the surgery mid May. By then my mobility was minimal. I was taking Tramadol and morphine to be able to get around the house and do basic tasks. \n\nSeen as I am only 9 weeks post surgery I am still in recovery mode. I can put 100% of my body weight on my leg and take steps with no pain. The pic above is from when I got my cast changed. In week 12 I move into a walking boot and increase strength and balance building exercises.\n\nI was in a bad way before the op and now that I am pain free, off pain meds and clear headed I do not regret the surgery in the slightest. \n\nThe things I was worried about in 2016 like the long recovery, not being able to bend the ankle, the potential damage to surrounding joints. adjusting to the limitations etc. All those things eventually came to fruition a long time before I had the surgery..\n\nI am still a bit nervous about how weak my leg will be once the cast comes off, strengthening the leg below the knee and  adapting to the new limitations. With that said I am feeling confident I will bounce back and I am looking forward to the challenge. I am still in a cast and only just begun to put my full body weight on the leg. It feels good so far though. Being pain free is the biggest plus so far.\n\nI cannot give you much info n driving as it is my left ankle and I drive an automatic. I think the general consensus is that once you keep and build up strength things like driving should not be a problem but definitely consult with your doc on that one. That is an interesting one. I was originally ready for surgery in 2016 but I could not decide between a replacement or fusion. \n\n\u201cFusions do not move, replacements do not last\u201d\n\nI am a drummer so my left foot is vitally important. The prospect of not being able to move my ankle was quite a daunting thought.\n\nI got a few opinions from foot and ankle specialists  here in the U.K. I even took some of my hi hat pedals in to show them how my foot rests and moves on the pedal. \n\nThe general consensus and advice from the docs was the fusion would restrict the ankle movement but I would be completely pain free. The lifespan of the fusion would be more of a one and done situation with the chance of further surgical intervention relatively low.\n\nThe replacement would retain more movement and allow me to do more activities that are not as favourable post fusion. However with the replacement they all warned me the advancement of the actual ankle prosthetics was less reliable long term due to the intrigues of the ankle bone and joints. I think they said I could expect 10 to 15 good years with the replaced ankle if I looked after it. But future surgical intervention would be inevitable based on my age. \n\nI think the ankle replacement would be the preferred option In terms of keeping movement but I was put of by the uncertainty and possibility of future surgeries down the line.\n\nI think it is a very personal thing and different people have different needs. I do think in the near future replacements will be the gold standard for ankle surgeries. I would be curious to know how long the Haemophiliacs are getting from their replacements and their age/activity levels? 4 weeks non weight bearing, 4 weeks light weight bearing with crutches then 4 weeks full weight bearing with crutches. After 12 weeks the cast comes off and I move into walking boot for support while i strengthen  the leg and get back to a normal walking gait \ud83e\uddb6  I know different doctors and hospitals have different protocols  I am curious to hear more about your recovery. Where did you get the surgery?\n\nMy plan is basically 12 weeks in the, cast building up to full weight bearing on the leg. I am pretty much there now at week 9. I can take a few steps around the room with no discomfort. At 12 weeks I get the cast (finally) off and I move into an air cast walking boot.\n\nHow were you feeling after the cast was removed and beginning to walk? It is not a decision to take lightly for sure. I had a total knee replacement at 27 now a fusion at 35. I hope that is it for a while.\n\nWhat do you need done? Thanks. The only down side is being back on Prophylaxis during recovery as my post gene therapy levels are bouncing around 5% Good to hear that you got a few percentage points of benefit from the gene therapy. So if you were not recovering from the ankle fusion would you be on Hemlibra or just treating on demand? I was in the same exact boat as you. Got my surgery done at NorthShore Long Island Jewish Hospital in NYC. Recovery went superbly. Do not walk even if you feel like you can. Slowly put weight on your foot by putting your foot on the floor and putting pressure, not taking steps.  Once you get the cast off and go into the walking boot, you will still be using crutches but it will be easier to move your foot and only then can you start to train yourself to walk on the affected foot. I am sure you lost your leg muscles/fat/hair like I did. Icing, stretching your toes and wiggling your foot time to time to loosen it definitely helps. You will not have the same mobility on your affected foot so keep that in mind (my left foot can move circularly no problem, right foot can only do it partially now). Your foot will be stiff so whenever you wake up in the morning or from any nap, sit up right with your feet on the floor and allow the blood to flow back to your leg before doing any movements. When your foot feels like its on fire, you need more rest n ice as the nerves are still reconstructing. Walking will be a breeze but I would like to note that I have a 3cm height difference between my right leg and left leg so walking does not feel exactly the same but i have 1/10 pain now as opposed to before the surgery where the pain was too intense.. Other than that, I am more than certain you will appreciate the surgery :) If it was not for the surgery I would probably be treating with my regular Advate Factor 8 If I had a breakout bleed or if I was doing an activity that might cause a bleed.  I had no breakout bleeds from September 2019 to January 2021.\n\nI am still in an assessment stage as my clotting factor only reached the lower level a few weeks before surgery. I also have not fully recovered from the Immune suppression. I lost the feeling in my hands and feet as a result so my activity levels have much lower than usual. Really appreciate your reply! Thanks for all the detail! Im glad it is worked out for you and I am feeling optimistic about my own recovery. If you do not mind I might message you directly for some more details on your experience. \n\nI got my surgery done in London, UK at the Royal Stanmore Orthopaedic Hospital. I think I have a slightly different protocol than you had and I know there are different approaches to Ankle fusion based on the hospital and procedure. I am just taking a few steps with crutches  at the moment and it feels ok. I have got a special cast walking boot so it feels stable on the ground.\n\nThe few times I have had the cast replaced my leg has looked like a twig! Hahaha. Twig legs is normal. Shoot me a message anytime my friend :) Hi everyone thank you so much for this really helpful platform. I have found it so difficult to find a anyone in person that has had this a rare procedure on their leg&amp;ankle. I was in a bad winter sports accident in January &amp; have been in excruciating pain after piece puzzling my tibia &amp; fibula which has not worked. Now I am recommended a fusion. My question is can you ever run again once the fusion has been complete? I am 5 mii I nuts post surgery. I am walking without crutches and without a limp. Still a long way to go and a lot of strengthening to go.\n\nI was told running is not a good idea after a fusion. The reason being you end up putting too much stress on the non fused joints that are picking up the slack.", "European Commission approves Roche's Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A with inhibitors ", "Anyone else with Hyperfibrinolysis? Hello, \n\n   Throughout my life I was diagnosed first with Von Willebrand's, years later it was thought to be Factor V (5), years after that it was thought there was no bleeding disorder. My diagnosis continued for a long period of time as  undiagnosed.   It was not until recently after many tests a hematologist has it pinned as Hyperfibrinolysis. After about 10 years of no hospital visits.  I recently was admitted at the hospital for a week  receiving transfusions and Tranexamic acid (amicar).  However, because the condition is so rare it is caused issues with doctors in the hospital ranging from being scared to administer the transfusions, to disagreements on actually getting treatment or wanting to run lots of unnecessary tests (cat scan, ultra sound, multiple cardiologist opinions to well over 15 different blood draws... arms are like a pincushion)   just to know what we already know.. a hematoma caused by internal bleeding. I have a Hematologist, yet, unfortunately he was unable to be reached either after hours or not on call.  Leaving the care to other Hematologists, to handle the situation.. The good news is they think this can be handled with taken Tranexamic acid orally.  The bad news is the doctor will not easily prescribe it.  I have asked about keeping it on hand for future situations.. It was more or less shot down with there is limitations of shelf life of the drug and not knowing when another \"bleed\" could occur.  \n\nI am curious if there is anyone else with similar experiences and how this has affected your life? Have you seen or spoken to your usual hematologist since your hospitalization? S/he may have a different opinion after seeing the diagnostic tests that were performed, and s/he has a history of treating you. And, importantly, your hematologist actually specializes in bleeding disorders. Hematologists in ERs and critical care units, in my experience, just do not have enough experience with bleeding disorders to know about proper treatment options and care. That they are concerned with the shelf life of the medication...that tells me they are not well acquainted with any bleeding disorder medication, honestly. Whenever I had amicar on hand, it always had an expiration date farther away than my factor.\n\nUnfortunately I do not know much about amicar and its interactions with people with hyperfibrinolysis, and as I understand it directly inhibits fibrinolysis. So while in my experience I have never really had to regulate my amicar usage I am sure for you it is worth going to your hematologist directly. Sorry that you are going through all this with no one to lead the way. Hi Bessle,  Yes, I actually saw my hematologist two days after being released from the hospital.  He was surprised by the amount of blood loss.  He wanted to draw more blood a couple after taking the Tranexamic acid orally to  confirm it was working.  My coagulation index is 0 before and 3 after taking the pills, which great..  However, he was not keen on me keeping the medication on hand.. basically just use what I have left.. about 6 pills.  \n\nThank you for taking the time to share your opinion and your sympathy! I have afibrinogenemia (complete factor I deficiency) and have been routinely prescribed antifibrinolytics (amicar and, more recently, transexamic acid) by my hematologists to manage mucous membranr bleeds should they occur. I have asked them why antifibrinolytics are effective at stopping certain types of bleeds in a person who has no fibrinogen and they have not been able to explain why it works for me, but it does, so we have stuck with it.\n\nAs a kid, we had a bottle of liquid amicar at home that my doctors claimed had an indefinite shelf life. It was used effectively for well over a decade, and just a fee years ago, after it being buried in the back of a closet for the last 15 or 20 years, we found it had finally solidified and was no longer usable.\n\nSince amicar became more widely available in pill form many years ago, they started giving me an annual prescription to keep on hand. I rarely used it, but I can say for sure that the effectiveness of amicar pills drops off significantly after the one year mark.\n\nOver the last few years, due to availability and cost issues, my hematologists have switched me from amicar to transexamic acid. Like with amicar, they give me a new prescription each year to replace the old. I have never actually had to use because I have not had any mucous membrane bleeds for some time, so I cannot comment on it is actual shelf life, but I can say that my doctor\u2019s do not consider shelf life an issue if it is under one year. \n\nIt sounds like the doctor you are dealing with is outside of their comfort zone and is not doing their research.", "Marijuana &amp; Hemophilia - been off opioids for a while now  Congratulations! Thank you!  when your state does not offer medical cannabis for severe hemophiliacs... What is the backstory? I was diagnosed with hemophilia A severe before a year old but I did not have the ability of factor until I was around 7 years old. At eight years old I had my first I orthoscopic synovectomy ok my left knee. Around 14 years old iswhen I started being able to be on profilaxis. But the damage was already done at 19 years old I had a total knee replacement to that left knee.At 26 I had my right elbow replaced. Ever since I was little doctors had me on hydrocodone and then it just went up from there.It got to the point that I was on dilaudid 8 -10 mgs a day of hydromorphone. It is true that the pain after surgery is a lot less but you still have to live with the limited range of motion and the soreness.. I am currently holding off my right knee replacement for as long as I can.. and cannabis has just helped so much that I feel that I can function a lot more than when I was on opioids.. I felt like they controlled my life they would make me feel on functional yes that would take the pain away but I would just be in bed all day I could not be me.. My state does not have recreational or medical. I took it upon myself to make the trip to California and stock up on decent THC vape brands.. Can you say any more about the cannabis product you are using?  What is it and how do you use it? I currently only use crafted extracts they are a real reliable cannabis company.  You can find their products at  licensed dispensaries in California. It is a THC distillate. You attach it to to a vape pen..and use as needed 2/3 puffs works great.. I use a sativa Strain for during the day it is relaxes my muscles takes the pain away but it also energizes me and puts me in a better mood.. and at night I use a hybrid strain which really is more of a couch and chill vibe..i use it about an hour before going to sleep Getting a kid addicted to opiates...   That is messed up.   \n\nI have also got an elbow which is going bad.   Have you recovered?   If so, how was the recovery? I believe that PA's new MMJ law covers chronic pain conditions and that hemophiliacs would qualify, FYI. Just wanted to congratulate you with overcoming your pain by your own ways. I am 17 and I have been on opiates for most of my life for the same reason as you, so i know what it is like. \n\nEither way, good job, hope everything gets better for you soon :)", "I just do a YouTube channel for my son, who is a severe Hemophilia B.

So I am in my early 30's, type a severe. When i was a teenager I could go for three days without factor before bleeding somewhere. If I hit four days I was pretty much guaranteed to have a bleed. Over the last year or two I have not exactly been taking care of myself as well as I should be. I have not taken factor in at least two and a half weeks now and have not had any issues yet. I am starting on Hemlibra very soon, and it just occurred to me that I might have a hard time noticing much difference now because of my seemingly increased baseline factor level. They were going to check my levels before I started Hemlibra, but that was before lock down, and I never had the tests run. Now it seems I do not need to have it checked. \n\nI have had synovectomies on most, not all, of my target joints since I was in my teens, so I am sure that affects my bleed rate. But it seems as though I have stopped having spontaneous bleeds. I know I am not growing any more, and my lifestyle is much more...sedentary now, all of which affects my bleed rate as well, but it still does not really make sense. I suppose I should bring this up to my HTC team, but have any of you heard of something similar? Just because you have not had a bleed in a few weeks does not mean you will not get one in four weeks. Or five. \n\nSorry to say it but your Hemophilia will not suddenly get better, and your factor levels will not increase by themselves. But, bleeds can become less frequent with age. Ya i figured as much, it was just a sudden realization and seemed pretty weird. Just need a reality check sometimes, you know? Thanks. My factor level dropped with age and I am building an inhibitor. I was a mild with 7-11% and actually went 3 years at one point with no bleeds and no factor. Now I am down to 3% factor with a .38 inhibitor level and as of late have been having more bleeds. Wow. How often do you infuse now? Mind sharing your age range when that change happened? I am still as needed, and lately it is been like one bleed a month and takes 2-3 doses to heal up. I was worse than this as a kid with the 7-11% range because I did dumb stuff, but since I was 18 I would only get bleeds like once every 6 months prior to the drop in factor level. \n\nI am 31 going on 32 in a couple weeks. This all started last year.", "Drinking now, almost had a panic attack yesterday morning, and I am horrified to think I should be happy. I just started Hemlibra. I am getting my second dose in a day and a half. \n\nRight now, I have no idea what I am thinking. I went out without taking my standard factor, played darts, guitar, just did not end up feeling bad or uncomfortable. I was ***extremely*** skeptical when my doctors and hemo center personnel were talking to me about it. I felt like I could be some random example of someone who dies for some unknown reason because the medicine is so new and different. They gave me space to think about it, but then I heard the physical therapist say my elbow RoM decreased since last year, and I said that was it. I am starting it.\n\nI had a good week thinking about it, told plenty of people who definitely did not give much of a shit. Now I am just waiting for my second dose to come up. Then I am going to start doing it myself each week. I feel like I am ready to workout, to get a job, to feel human again. It is scary. I do not know what I am thinking, because there is a part of me that is incredibly afraid of something unknown, then a part of me that is worried things will not turn out as I hope, but the thought of not dealing with bleeds anymore is pretty much a new lease on life, and I cannot think of a better way to explain the idea than that. \n\nI am actually afraid to feel too happy, because a single subcutaneous shot per week to basically be normal sounds like a dream. It sounds as much like a cure as I could imagine. If I keep mild hemophilia \"factor\" levels, I have honestly never even seen mild hemophiliacs as real hemophiliacs(shoutout to /r/gatekeeping.) If you are not seeing consistent joint bleeds and joint deterioration, that is not even worth worrying about. If that is going to be what I can achieve now, I am actually just afraid to be happy about it, because it does not seem real. I just want to workout and feel healthier without it feeling like I am doing more harm than good. Congratulations :)\n\nI am on a 10-day schedule with my Alprolix (Factor IX) and I could not be happier. I have just received a scholarship over to the Philippines with uni, and I actually felt confident enough with my lack of bleeding that I accepted it. So Im spending a month overseas, and I only have to take a total 10 bottles of factor with me, and that includes extra in case of bleeds. \n\nSo, welcome to life :) Sucks to be one of the first at something. Probably most bleeders prefer to just be part of the herd.\n\nFeeling normal and happy can take a while to get used to. For the longest time I was afraid to feel that way because I did not want to jinx it. &gt; Alprolix\n\nHow does this compare? Hemlibra is an antibody(I guess) that lasts a full month in your system, so it is totally different from factor. That is the thing that scared me. There were problems with people taking inhibitor supplementary medicines that led to necrotic tissue forming, and it is abnormal to your body so you cannot even take standard factor levels without it messing with the reagents and showing up as 300% supposedly. It is all very scary to hear with something so different.  I am glad this treatment is working out so well for so many people, but I would have been extremely hesitant to be in the test groups for it, given the awful history of Hemophilia medications that were said to be safe and were not. I have heard about Hemlibra but only know the surface level of things. Are you only able to take it if you currently have inhibitors?  No, actually, inhibitors are a huge threat. There is some medicine that I am forgetting the name of, something with V, I believe, but it caused a lot of horrible problems for people. If you *do not* have an inhibitor, it is apparently amazing. I am in Indiana, and I believe our clinic got started on some of the early studies or something. We may have it earlier than some places, but our people have really been pushing to adopt it. They are going to be holding outreach efforts across the state within maybe the next 6 months just to get people started on it. I am afraid to say it is life-changing just yet, but I am kind of lying. I have been telling a lot of people this may be completely life-changing for me. I am used to pain, so I can ignore some of my joint damage if it is possible that the pain is no longer associated with getting a bleed into those joints. If I can workout and hear a joint pop without getting a bleed, I will pretty much be completely okay with working out and getting a job. That is my hope. I am on disability, so hopefully these means I can get a part-time job, basically anything, to supplement my situation. I honestly enjoy the thought of something physical, although I am sure I should still avoid that. I just kind of like the thought. Man. Props to you for getting your head above water! We all know how much we can hurt sometimes... do not be afraid to exercise but definitely be safe about it. I used to be a personal trainer and have hemophilia myself. If you ever have questions about it or need someone else to reach out to feel free to PM me. I am glad you are feeling better and hope things keep going your way! Thanks for taking the time to answer.  I do not have hemophilia my nephew (8 yr old) does, he does Factor IV every 3 days.  Just being around and watching the difference between when he is been super active and needs it vs a couple hours after he is taken his factor; is night and day.  \n\nFrom some one who only understands the struggle looking from the outside in...I really hope you the best. God this is me to a T. I also have my second dose on Tuesday and it is been weird to think about. I have been on weekly treatments for the past year of Eloctate (Factor VIII) for my left elbow. \n\nThis past week has been me dreading Hemlibra not working. I ended up getting the mild joint aching that is a side effect but they said it usually goes away for most people pretty quick. I only had it the evening of the treatment but I do not know if it was from the treatment, or that we got a snow storm the next day (which I tend to get irritation in my elbow and hip when it does). The following day my knee was hurting a bit but it went away by the end of the day. Since then it is been pretty good. No problems with my elbow yet *knocks on wood*. \n\nI am really hoping this works out because it means no more IVs, no more worrying, no more ER visits for bleeds. Being a mild Hemophiliac is something that just sounds weird to me. I do not know what to expect, but I am planning on starting at the gym in a couple of weeks once I know this medicine is working for sure. It works for both. It was just passed in late September for those without inhibitors to use it. It passed for inhibitors last year.\n\nHemlibra was originally created for those with inhibitors. What it does is go around Factor VIII and combines Factor 9 and 10 levels to increase clotting.\n\nThis means that for those with Factor VIII inhibitors, this goes around that. For those without inhibitors, it still works the same way. I would just need to get Factor VIII when it comes time for any surgeries or anything, but other than that I currently get a once per week shot in the stomach with a tiny subcutaneous needle instead of IVs. If my factor levels are high enough, I *might* be able to go to once per month. Wow. So did you give yourself IV\u2019s before Hemlibra? When I was talking to my hemophilia care center they mentioned the product may be something to talk about next visit. Does taking this medicine seem easier?  Oh yeah, I was thinking of FEIBA. If you are on FEIBA, I think you cannot take Hemlibra or you have to discuss it and take some risks with a low dose. I forget the full details, but it is a very scary idea.  I realized my joint damage is permanent, therefore I will probably always have some pain and discomfort, but the pain I feel from my joints during an activity almost always transitions to a bleed. I *honestly* think I can completely ignore a lot of pain, it is just I have been trained to associate this kind of joint discomfort with a resulting bleed. If I can do some physical stuff and continuously not end up with a bleed, that would just be unbelievable. I am so trained to my problems after 31 years that I am almost always going to be stuck with a feeling of cautiousness. I will have to see how things turn out. I am sorry but I have never seen FEIVA before what does that stand for? From a quick check online: \n\n&gt;FEIBA. Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (freeze-dried, sterile, human plasma fraction used to aid in coagulation)\n\nI am guessing Hemlibra ignores Factor 8 inhibitors? I am not sure, but apparently there were horrific problems for some people who took Hemlibra along with FEIBA. I do not take it, but just hearing about necrotic tissue forming randomly in people's bodies was horrifying. Somehow they must have been clotting internally to the point of organ damage and tissue death. Those kinds of words were in my mind when my doctor was talking with me about it, and somehow I still kept feeling like I was going to have a panic attack even though I do not take FEIBA. \n\nIt reminds me of when you think about your heart beating inside your chest and how it is the only thing keeping you alive. Sometimes that thought would make me panicky, or certain other directly real and physical thoughts about my insides. Thinking about my blood being potentially dangerous to me was very scary, especially since Hemlibra is something totally different from normal factor. \n\nI will be going for my second dose in the morning, though, so I think my fear should start to subside if this goes well and I feel okay for a few days.  I could not hit my own veins even if I tried. My veins are small and like to roll. After the past year of weekly treatments, they are beyond scarred. All of the veins in my arms and back of hand. 4 weeks ago I had 6 fucking pokes to get my IV done. It sucked.\n\nBut yeah, no more IVs. No more mixing the meds up.\n\n( It tells you everything about it and how to take it. It is simply one vial, you transfer in with a large needle and then you attach a subcue needle and inject it in your stomach, thigh or back of arm. The subcue needle is only a cm long or so. Really nice. &gt; I want to be able to use my Xbox racing wheel which I have not been able to do since my elbow started causing issues.\n\nJeez, this is funny to hear. It is these types of little things that most people do not realize can cause us difficulty sometimes just because of the pain. Then again, as I just said to someone else, I almost feel like pain would not bother me nearly as much if I did not have a lifetime of training teaching me how that pain was going to result in even worse pain and joint deterioration the next day. I ended up avoiding so many simple things. My friend would have me help carry something, move his boat into the truck or something, then I would immediately say \"Yep, that might be a bleed.\" He would always be surprised since it was often just something simple and fairly low stress, but the simple use of muscles would often turn into a bleed later.\n\nAnyway, I feel like rambling a bit since you found some similarity.\n\nI have been taking Advate still for quite a few years now. I never started on the longer-lasting stuff because I felt like it was going to be senselessly expensive(to others) and I find little value in my life anymore. I thought it was insane to imagine costing taxpayers like $600,000 so I could work at Burger King and make $12,000 part time or whatever else I might do. I would basically never match my value to a company in my cost simply for the chance to work, so I felt like it was pointless. I got on disability and just avoided taking my medicine unless I really needed it. I figured I would just sit at my computer and get by somehow.\n\nSince I have always been introverted, avoided sports *most* of my life, I have basically been overstimulated to a lot of entertainment. I hibernated in my room for the majority of like 7 years or so. I just turned 31, but I only recently got my own place last December. \n\nI spend *so much time* just playing games, watching gaming streams, watching Netflix, and doing those together a lot of the time. I started this super-addicting hobby of watching cool streamers or passive Netflix shows on my second monitor while I also play calm and passive games on my other one. Like, I would play modded Minecraft, Binding of Isaac, Rimworld, etc., and watch Sevadus, CobaltStreak, etc., on Twitch. Or I would watch shows like Parks &amp; Rec or Star Trek, which are both normally low on the visuals and chill for watching while mostly distracted. I loved doing that for quite a while, but it definitely ends up giving you a feeling of overstimulation. I have got so many pleasant memories of like worlds I made/explored in Minecraft combined with random thoughts of Star Trek or whatever else.\n\nAnyway, I ended up even getting on Adderall at some point, and that was partly for the personal desire to find enjoyment and energy in different efforts. I did that for the last couple years which got me arguing even more on Reddit in a lot of ways. I have spent so much time on here over the last 7 years or so that it is insanity. I get depressed when I get banned from yet another sub just because I have got complex conspiracy-theory-tier arguments that a lot of people do not respect, so it only takes one mod to decide to cut me off of discussion with millions of people. It sucks when my life is so stuck on the internet, and I think it is stupid to take the effort to make alts just to sneak around bans, especially since that can result in getting shadowbanned or something.\n\nAnyway, lots of bullshit, too much time spent sitting at my computer, and generally a very low possibility of enjoyment from these types of entertainment. Especially without working, I have all day to just sit here. I am old enough now and lost enough time doing bullshit that I feel like I cannot handle it anymore, so I have been pushing myself to get out to hopefully find a relationship, because I feel like that is the only thing that could entertain me after having been single for way too much of the last 8 years or so. I have had a few things, but just not much that felt serious.\n\nWith that in mind, I have been going out a lot and just getting wasted. I am poor, so I have found bars that have great deals on certain nights. I go there, often bring flasks just so I can be an alcoholic and feel comfortable without spending all my money in a night. Then I have even started realizing driving is stupidity, so I have got blankets and end up sleeping in my car because fuck it. Not like I ever actually have anything to do the next day. \n\nI had a couple girlfriends a few months ago, but both of those situations were horribly toxic, to the point of being dangerous. I actually had one girl physically attack me on two occasions. I was 30 and they were both only 21, so that was weird. I just look so young a lot of the time, so people often think I am around that age.\n\nI have been getting out and being social enough that I feel so incredibly different from normal. I do not know about you, but I have been so bad at socializing that Reddit has definitely been my main source for such a long time. Getting out more has been a massive change, enough that I get a weird anxiety about how I am *not* irrationally socially anxious anymore. It is like I am just confused about how I feel now. \n\nProblem is, I have been drinking way too much, and it is obvious even after moving out I have still been horribly depressed. I spent last winter mostly in my place, then when it finally warmed up I eventually got those girlfriends, but it was horrible. Now I just cannot handle being alone all the time, so I go out like twice a week, at least, just to put myself around people and meet tons of people. I play darts and whatnot like I mentioned. \n\nSince I am still obviously depressed in certain ways, trying to fully give up smoking and drastically reduce my drinking which seems to all being failing, it is been obvious that I am not sure how to value my life. I have even been gaining a bit of weight recently after quitting my year-long attempt at veganism at the start of June. \n\nBasically every time I think of how to get out of my depression, my mind just blanks out. No fucking idea. I could say things like it would drastically help if I had a job, but I know I still would not feel \"happy,\" moreso just distracted. A lot of the time, thanks to advice and personal thought, I come to the conclusion that my real solution would be to start working out.\n\nAnd *that is what is always sucked.*\n\nI know the natural antidepressant is to workout, feel healthier, look better, have the chance to date more actively and with confidence, and even the thought of getting a job sounds nice with some of that in mind. Especially after pretty much using up all my excitement about gaming and internet stuff, I just cannot possibly find joy in sitting here. The option I have been turning to is purely social experience at the bars, but I am doing it with complete disregard for my health. One big reason I know I am looking worse from weight gain is because I have had a good number of people recently guessing my age correctly. It is almost funny that it is gotten that obvious because of age guesses, but I know that is it.\n\nAlright, so I have successfully rambled to you.\n\nObviously, what I am saying is this might be completely life-changing for me specifically because it is *exactly* what I have needed. I need the ability to be physical without being afraid. If that is what this will allow, I have no doubt that I am going to get fit. I have dealt with a lifetime of physical apprehension because of my hemophilia, so this shit is like opening a massive door to an entirely new kind of addiction, and it is even something that is *good* for me. Inb4 I find out I have cancer and I am dying or something, because I figured eventually when my life starts going in a good direction that would happen, but... I am excited and afraid to be excited.\n\nOh yeah, and you mentioned your race wheel. You have VR? I got an Oculus like a couple years ago. I invested in that a bunch, kind of hoping it would allow me to feel \"free\" despite being a hemophiliac. The thought of piloting a spaceship, driving a semi or race car, climbing mountains, etc., was just so cool. And I have got to say I absolutely love the experience. It is not as amazing as it could be, but I could not help but jump on the chance to try the first iteration of real VR since I would already recently put the money into a PC that happened to be VR capable. Now I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for it.  &gt; It is these types of little things that most people do not realize can cause us difficulty sometimes just because of the pain.\n\nYeah, about 2 years ago I got a bleed in my elbow and made the mistake in thinking it was a muscle bleed. It was in the evening so I waited to make an appointment with the Infusion Center till the next day. It did not get any worse, really, but I got it treated and thought nothing of it. Then it slowly got worse over time. More treatments, eventually leading to weekly prophy treatments permanently. Did that for 2 months and then switched from Recombinate to Eloctate which is longer lasting and better overall. Never had a single breakout bleed on Eloctate apart from the one week my car had issues and I did not go get a treatment that week. I think the elbow problem was caused by my wheel (poor form when using it). Since then I have not really been able to use it for longer than an hour before my elbow starts aching, I remember the extreme pain I had once with this elbow before starting prophy and put it away in the closet. I am definitely hoping that Hemlibra will alleviate this. I started physical therapy a few months ago for the muscles around it but it did not really seem to be helping much so I kind of laxed on it. But if Hemlibra starts working really well I plan to go to the gym and start it back up again.\n\n&gt; I thought it was insane to imagine costing taxpayers like $600,000 so I could work at Burger King and make $12,000 part time or whatever else I might do.\n\nHonestly never even thought about that. But at the same time, I guess I do not really care? Not in a bad way but just in the sense that I need this medication and it is not my fault it is so expensive sort of thing? Not sure how to explain it how it does not sound bad.\n\n&gt; I spend so much time just playing games, watching gaming streams, watching Netflix, and doing those together a lot of the time.\n\nYeah this is what I do most of the time. I co-run a YouTube channel with a friend, play video games, stream and watch streams and watch various Netflix shows. I do get out though. Saturday night game nights with friends every other week, have people over a lot, go camping, walk the dog, etc. I also am pursuing a career in Mobile Application Development since I cannot really do anything physically demanding. Sitting at a desk staring at a computer screen is not my ideal desire, especially considering most of my hobbies involve that as well, but it is the life I set up for myself and I am fine with it. Hopefully Hemlibra will also allow me to venture out for more physically demanding hobbies that I want to do, such as going to various track day events and maybe even Autocross racing with cars when I get the money to do so. Although I planned to do this regardless of Hemlibra, as well as the gym thing. I am just holding off on the gym because I want to ensure that Hemlibra is working so I do not need to go get a Factor VIII treatment in case of emergency.\n\n&gt; You have VR?\n\nNo, I put my wheel away for the time being so I was never able to fully endeavor into that hobby. Although I have tried VR, and while it is really cool it kind of messes with my inner ear problem a bit and can make me a little dizzy. I would probably have to mess with my settings a lot, but I have a sinus issue that occasionally leads to brief moments of dizziness (usually when standing somewhere and looking up or looking down from high up). It is not quite vertigo, but my doctor says it has something to do with ear wax build up or something and when that happens it can throw off my sense of balance. Usually get it once per month and I am pretty good about controlling it when I know I am about to get it. So I am not sure if I would ever be able to use VR which is fine with me. I do not mine just running a TV setup. All I want to use it my wheel. Want to get iRacing and do some NASCAR racing and dirt racing with my friend. &gt; I waited to make an appointment with the Infusion Center till the next day.\n\nHuh? How is this work? Are you not in America? I have been getting medicine/supplies shipped to me since I was little. My mom gave me infusions until I was like 12 when I started for myself. I just got back today from my second Hemlibra dose, and next week they are sending someone to my place to oversee this third dose. It is not really that complicated, but they are wary. I already did the full process once today, and because of my weight I basically just have to use two vials perfectly. Think it is a 1 and a .7, so it is pretty easy to set up the syringe and make sure I have got two lines past the 1.5 mark. Although, I wanted to do a shot per week to keep numbers as stable as possible, they have set me for twice a month because it will allow me to keep using those two vials perfectly each time.\n\n&gt;I guess I do not really care? Not in a bad way but just in the sense that I need this medication and it is not my fault it is so expensive sort of thing?\n\nYeah, this was a weird stance I took. I mean, I was a vegan for a year when it is pretty easy to feel like it is not making much change(even though I felt healthier on top of it.) I just heard about those numbers and realized *I actually have control over that much money.* I have also been so sedentary most of my life that I often did not feel like factor was necessary. When I was younger, it just seemed like I could somehow do quite a lot without getting bleeds, but I think I just learned very well how to be careful and avoidant of a lot of physically threatening activities. \n\nAnyway, I changed my stance about my medicine use when I realized my joints are still slowly deteriorating. I cannot even have many relaxed hobbies without getting bleeds randomly, which is anything as simple as guitar or darts. And if I want to be social and go out and drink like I have been doing lately, I almost always try to take my medicine beforehand. I had waking up with a bruised shin, painful knee, arm, toe, whatever, just because of some little drunken moment of silliness or a simple accident. \n\n&gt;I co-run a YouTube channel with a friend\n\nThat is awesome. After I got my computer built properly, I started putting some money into parts for streaming/videos. Ended up uploading a bunch of green-screened gaming stuff to Youtube, but my perfectionism annoys me and has me removing things way too often. Like my Yeti mic has a slight buzz that just makes me hate everything, or certain videos had my mini-fridge nearby and I did not catch that it made a very audible and high-pitched buzzing. So many stupid little details that make me just hate everything and \"plan to redo it in the future.\" I am proud of my setup though, and it is been a lot of fun learning the technical side of making quality videos. \n\n&gt;I want to ensure that Hemlibra is working so I do not need to go get a Factor VIII treatment in case of emergency.\n\nYeah, see, this is strange to me. The plan is they are going to leave me with two full and two half doses in case I ever need factor for a breakthrough bleed. It is inconvenient to think I may have to do that at some point, but it is nice that they let me keep it around.\n\n&gt; So I am not sure if I would ever be able to use VR which is fine with me.\n\nEve: Valkyrie was one game that actually gave me horrible vertigo. Most games did not, but this one mainly uses an Xbox controller for dogfights in space, so there is no real frame of reference aside from broken up ships and space rocks most of the time, then the controls allow you to whip around in different directions and spin around however you would like. Something about the movement speed just had me feeling drunk and sick after 15 minutes the first few times. Thankfully, I got used to it after playing some Elite Dangerous. Got me used to the lack of horizontal reference as well as helped me to control my ship movements so they do not make me sick. Interesting experience.\n\n&gt;As for you, good luck...That would be the dream, but I am perfectly happy if Hemlibra works without consequences.\n\nThanks. It would be a dream to be able to say \"I am not a hemophiliac anymore,\" for me, but the thought of barely ever getting bleeds sounds pretty awesome. \n\nI just really hope working out does not stress my joints enough to cause them. I heard another guy who was on it for a year and a half had a single breakthrough bleed while helping a friend move furniture. Now, I love the idea of only a single break-through bleed, but moving furniture is lame to hear. I have moved furniture and it is been hit or miss whether I get a bleed. I would think that should be perfectly fine with Hemlibra, so now I am afraid working out might not be as possible. I would rate moving furniture and working out to be around the same level of difficulty, mainly because there is muscle use and some joint stress, but it is not like it is something really fast. The speed and stress of kicking or throwing a ball is something that makes me think of an instant bleed in many cases, not just using a muscle. I am now nearly 21 months in and yesterday I nearly missed my shot - just forgot about it! And that is after a three-day period of heavy walking and cross-country travel. Back on Advate/Adynovate I would have been a wreck for a week.\n\nWelcome to the good life. So do you expect I would be able to workout with my current joints? I have reduced RoM in my right elbow, and in the past I would workout, push myself a little, then I would end up with a bleed. \n\nI took my second intro dose, which should have me at a decent level now, but I am actually afraid to even think I could do anything. I am so used to being afraid of physical efforts that it does not feel possible.  &gt; I have been getting medicine/supplies shipped to me since I was little. My mom gave me infusions until I was like 12 when I started for myself.\n\nI was on Recombinant Factor VIII at the time (IV required) when I first started getting my elbow bleeds. Nurses have a tough enough time hitting my bad veins, let alone me trying to do it myself. They are small, roll and after a year and a half of prophy, they are scarred beyond belief. My hands have track marks, the cubital on my left arm is extremely painful even when a butterfly needle for blood draws breaks the skin due to how scarred it is and my right side is hit or miss. As for the forearms, you cannot see them at all and they tend to blow. If I do not drink a ton of water in the 24 hours before my treatment, warm the arms with a hot towel and a few other common tricks, it can take upwards of 6 pokes to hit me. And then there are days where I do everything required and the veins blow, roll or whatever. Then a lot of fishing has to happen which is the most painful part. So no, I definitely would not be able to do it myself, nor would my family. I have had anesthesia have to come in to hit me once in the Infusion Center because they just could not hit my veins. They have gotten really bad. I just started Hemlibra last week. I give myself my second dose tomorrow here at home luckily. It is going to be so nice not having to leave to get poked and have my blood pressure spike due to anxiety from multiple possible pokes.\n\n&gt; The plan is they are going to leave me with two full and two half doses in case I ever need factor for a breakthrough bleed.\n\nYeah they told me I would need Factor VIII for surgeries or possible break through bleeds (if those happen) but that realistically Hemlibra should take care of everything. I am the first non-inhibitor patient at my Clinic, granted they had 4 or 5 people being put on it this month, but they said the 4 people with inhibitors they have had on it for the past year have been doing great. Only 1 had a break through bleed which cleared itself up the next day with no extra Factor needed.\n\n&gt; I heard another guy who was on it for a year and a half had a single breakthrough bleed while helping a friend move furniture.\n\nI guess it depends on their story. It is always possible they used poor form or lifted something extremely heavy I guess. I will still definitely be careful, but at least I know I can hopefully do some more mundane things (such as just simply walking on a treadmill) with limited risk of bleeds. Long term walking or long term sitting tended to give me bleeds, but if this gets rid of those altogether and I do not have to get a weekly IV stuck in my arm (possibly up to 6 times just to hit my badly scarred veins) I am fine with that. I can poke myself in the stomach with a 1 cm long needle every week. Maybe even once per month depending on how my body fully reacts to Hemlibra in the long term (according to my doctor). &gt; it can take upwards of 6 pokes to hit me.\n\nI took a photo of my veins for a friend not long ago, actually: \n\nMy dad's veins are basically pipes. Even nurses would say that. I am not so extreme, but I have luckily never had problems with my veins... aside from when I was a baby. I was really thicC, and this was just after I was born. I disagree with circumcision pretty much 10001%, which really sucks to think I went through that as a hemophiliac only to spend so much time trying to \"regrow\" the skin just to feel more comfortable again, but I think that was when this occurred. I was bleeding, they realized it would not stop, figured out I was a hemophiliac, then ending up sticking me *14 times* as a little baby. I imagine those needles would be more like a pipe to an infant. It is disturbing for me to imagine me going through that when I was probably my most sensory. Trying to figure out the world and make sense of how I should adapt to things only to be put in extreme pain, halfway exsanguinated, and pretty much tortured without my knowing of why.\n\n&gt;Then a lot of fishing has to happen which is the most painful part.\n\nThis is the thought that always makes me cringe. I hate missing so much and having to poke around. Uhg... I just remembered there was one point when an infusion from my mom was incredibly painful, and I am not sure why I thought of that just now, but I think she might have done something like had the bevel upside down. Uhg, guess that is just more cringe thoughts.\n\n&gt;I give myself my second dose tomorrow here at home luckily. It is going to be so nice not having to leave to get poked and have my blood pressure spike due to anxiety from multiple possible pokes.\n\nYes! When I did it my first time this morning, it was amazing. For some reason, the nurse doing it last week kind of hurt pretty damn bad. The needle just seemed to have a burning tear feeling when she put it in. When I did it myself, absolutely nothing. Smooth as butter, like even less pain than the hand infusions I am *completely* used to doing.\n\n&gt;I will still definitely be careful, but at least I know I can hopefully do some more mundane things (such as just simply walking on a treadmill) with limited risk of bleeds.\n\nI just pushed myself and threw around a 20 and 25 lb weight a few times a bit ago. It is not unbelievable to think it would not cause a bleed, but I really felt pretty comfortable. I hope it is not placebo, but I definitely do not feel weird yet. My arm feels fine. I am really hoping to find a workout buddy or get a gym membership soon. I could always start going on walks/jogging and doing pushups and casual tension exercises around the house, but I kind of like the thought of being out and around people now. I feel like getting healthier can latch to a new social avenue, even if that just means I will be *around* people instead of just being alone. Sometimes \"being social\" for me has just meant I would go and take a walk around the mall. Just seeing people has a strange way of filling a vague social void that can feel comforting.\n I also have right elbow issues - and had surgery it a year and a half ago b/c of nerve problems.\n\nSo your first dose was last week and tomorrow is your second dose? I would personally wait another 1-2 weeks just to be on the safe side.\n\nI also do not know what you mean by 'working out' (the idea of lifting hinks me out majorly, especially since my RoM makes it impossible for me to have correct posture) but for now, trust your body (and rest/ice when you think you will need it) but also trust the medication. I got my second dose yesterday, but I decided to mess around with 20 and 25 lb weights this morning. Did not feel any problems. It feels pretty cool. I am hopeful, to say the least. I want to be ripped in a year. That would be amazing.", "Biogen's new Hemophilia B drug could replace Pfizer's old one: Lasts 3 times as long as BeneFix with no signs of inhibitors ", "You Want Me?

Here they are: \n\nMy doctor said I am close to the reference range so it is nothing to worry about, but what I am reading suggests they might be wrong.\n\nMy blood type is A+. Strong history of atraumatic bleeding (football size hematomas). I also have Ehlers Danlos syndrome.\n\nRight now I am in a wheelchair because of a joint bleed in my hip that keeps recurring. Any help appreciated! Have other factors (V, VII, IX, XI) been tested? Factor deficiencies in any of those could impact bleeding.  Also just a thought, even if VWF is only slightly out of range, maybe some interaction with hypermobility/EDS makes it more of an issue? This is the only test I have had so far besides platelet count and PTT, prothrombin time and bleeding time, which were all normal. I am going to try to get a referral to a hematologist.\n\nI too suspect that my bleeding is partly due to the hEDS which is why I mentioned it--my hips are among my loosest joints. This bleed has been beyond excruciating--going on 3 months in a wheelchair now because every time I walk it starts up again. I am worried about the possibpy permanent damage this is doing to my joint. Yea a hematologist/Hemophilia Treatment Center would be a good idea. My PTT times are normal/just outside of range even though my Factor IX is only 12%, so PTT is not always a great indicator. And like you said, good to be proactive with the joint bleeds. Any time a joint bleeds it can cause permanent damage so figuring out what is going on to fix this/prevent more is important. Best of luck! This is going to sound like a weird question but when you have dental work or have to have your skin cut in some way, do they ask if you are on Warfarin? Bruising/joint bleeds are not common with levels of VWF that high - HTC referral might be sensible as they have the knowledge to look at a whole range of bleeding disorders! \n\nI have severe type 2A with basically no VWF functionality - bruising and spontaneous bleeds lots of, as yet no spontaneous joint bleeds but my FVIII levels are over 20% which tends to be enough to prevent them.

That was all, I nearly died beacause of my heavy period but that did not bother him too much. I went to another hematologist who looked at the results and decided to do the tests again, plus a genetic test. The genetic test proved the VWD, but the hematologist also told me that the symptoms vary. I basically \"only\" suffer from my periods, but do not have any nose bleedings or severe bruises. \n\nMaybe it is worth a try to ask for a second opinion on your results. All the best for you! We (me and my four children have VWD). \nWe have found Von Vendi to be the beat factor to stop our bleeds. \nMy advise is to keep looking until you find a hematologist who will look outside the box to help you find the best plan of care for you. I do not have trouble with mucocutaneous bleeding so much as internal bleeding. I have been hospitalized for two separate hematomas on separate body parts and both times hospital staff were really intensely questioning me about whether I would taken any medications that could thin my blood or if I would been hit by a car/had some other trauma. That is good to know. Ehlers danlos is a genetic disorder of collagen and I learned today that VWF needs to interact with collagen to form effective clots. I am wondering if my mildly low VWF + ehlers danlos might be fully explanatory. Going to pursue a referral because this is definitely over my (very kind!) Pcp's head.\n\nI did not realize that joint bleeds were uncommon since I have always been this way till I had two so severe that I had to be hospitalized. Yikes. Good advice, thanks! So far this has all been through my primary care dr, so I am going to pursue a referral to hematology. Wishing you And yours heath! It is quite likely the the EDS, one condition is plenty! My hematologist recently explained to me that low VWF will only produce difficulties in clotting--it will not change the volume of blood that is coming out.  She said the latter is called excessive bleeding, which is not VWF related but something else, which can happen whether or not there is a problem with VWF.  In my case, I have low VWF but I also have an excessive bleeding disorder.  I get dental work or have a cyst removed, the first thing that is always shouted at me is \"Are you on Warfarin?!\" like I would not report that.  That apparently is a whole slew of different tests that are not a Factor VIII panel.  I am not a doctor or any sort of bleeding disorder expert but this is just what my hematologist with the hemophilia center explained to me recently. Definitely advocate for yourself to get a referral to a hematologist though if you are being asked about blood thinners.  Good luck &lt;3 Going to continue exploring this! There is some peer reviewed research that suggests ehlers danlos patients with excessive bleeding (thanks for clarifying terminology) benefit from DDAVP. I have not been able to stop the bleeding in my hip for 3 months now (mri confirmed). I am wondering if DDAVP could help me stabilize it enough to start to heal. It seems really dumb to let myself become permanently disabled just because my PCP thinks I am close enough to the reference range to not have VW and therefore ignores my excessive bleeding.\n\nHere is hoping I get an awesome hematologist on board to help me soon! Yep!  There is more to this bleeding stuff than just Factor VIII panel stuff but also platelet disorders, too.  Definitely locate your regional hemophilia treatment center and give them a call.  They are fantastic and very helpful.  Do not let the hemophilia in the term scare you off. They treat hemophiliac or \"bleeding\" disorders of all types and it might surprise you but according to the CDC, some treat female EDS patients over the age of 2, which is super interesting.  Even if you are on the border, they can definitely help you from the looks of it. My super amazing hematologist is with my regional hemophilia treatment center.   \n\n\n(  \n\n\nAs this kind of bleeding patient, I have been on DDAVP for surgery and now tranexamic acid for dental/oral surgery.  They are both very helpful and are used regardless of what my VWF levels are currently at (clotting factors can go up and down).  I sure hope you get help soon.  Give them a call! Have you checked your Factor I lvls? Afibrinogenemia and other Factor I diseases are pretty rare and most doctors will not even look at that possibility. We are these tests done by your regular doctor or by a Hemophilia Treatment Center? If they were not performed by a hematologist familiar with our specific bleeding conditions I recommend calling one and asking if they will review your test results as part of a second opinion. I cant speak for any HTC near you, but I cannot imagine the one near me would tell anyone no. My PCP since referred me to their hematology/oncology department and I am getting a lot of follow up tests done finally!! The specialist took one look at my result and ordered several more special tests. Very glad to here. I want to say, I am a bit embarrassed to say but after some misinformation regarding treatments available to me, several years without insurance, and relying on a regular hematologist for care... I basically went without good treatment, or any treatment, for years! It has cost me dearly. It was someone in the very community that got me set back on the right track! I pass their words to you, \"Get yourself a REAL Hematologist!\" I suppose it had not really occured to me that way before but... A huge number of hematologists are hemo/oncology specialists. And most of them have never specifically treated a hemophiliac. Get you a doctor that HAS. Advocate for yourself. Loudly. One other thing I have learned... If you want a test run... And the doctor says it is not a big deal... Tell them you want it noted in your chart, while you wait, that they refused to do any tests.\n\nYou will get tests done. Lol. I have had internal bleeding with severe low factor XIII and low on VWD. Followup test came back negative or right within the reference range. \n\nSide question, but did you get a covid vaccine yet? If yes, which one and what was your experience? I am waiting to get an appointment with my hematologist after trying not to think about it for six years. I am scared to death because of my bleeding tendency. I am okay with external cuts also, and my body is not good with internal bleeding. From what I understand, I keep bleeding and cannot clot (was under anesthesia for hours while my doctor sat there trying to stop bleeding) I have not gotten it yet but that is because of other issues delaying it. I am seeing if I can get cleared now for it but I imagine that it is going to be like any other vaccination when it comes to bleeding tendencies for us. I hope at least.

But - not advice.\n\nEither way, have a labatt or whatever for me :) If you get drunk while having an active bleed, you may inhibit the ability to clot and heal properly. Alcohol causes inflammation so you may notice sore joints.\n\nThe risk is more in the drunk stages. Getting sloppy and hurting yourself. I do not recommend drinking with an active bleed.\n\nPersonally, I have quit drinking because it hurts my joints almost immediately and the pain is just not worth it anymore. I am also on antidepressants and that does not mix well with booze. I did have my fun in my 20's (am 34 now), so I do not feel sad about it.

No bleeds, no adverse events, no inhibitors, no immune response requiring steroids.\n\nYou are on the right track with your thoughts about your joints.  This gene therapy cannot fix your joints, but if your factor activity level gets high enough you are not going to be having any more joint bleeds...so no more joint damage caused by bleeds.\n\nI was also concerned about the future cost and availability of gene therapy if and when it gets approved.

I have discussed it with friends and family but I think it is hard for them to understand the impact.  Frankly I am tired of infusions.  My veins are shot due to having daily infusions for over a year. Target joints suck. My dose was 5x10^11 vg/kg.  I did not feel sick during or after the infusion.  In my case, there was no downtime.  Is that something they say is possible?\n\nI have no concerns about over clotting.  Based on what I know about the first 10 people treated most FIX activity levels get into the 30-50% range.  One person got into the 70s and that is just the low end of the normal range.\n\nHave you thought about switching to an extended half-life product so that you do not have to infuse every day?\n\nSo the trial you are considering is the Phase III trial?

So from my perspective I would not think twice about it mate Yes it is the phase 3.  I was only concerned that they are using the Padua variant of the gene which has 8 times ther activity. It was discovered in a family that over clotted so I am not sure where the sweet spot is with regards to the level of expression. \n\nNo one said anything specifically about downtime but I was wondering about those patients who needed steroids.  I wondered if they had any clinical manifestations. \n\nI was able to have surgery to correct the constant joint bleeding so I do not need to treat daily anymore but it really sucked.  If i missed a day the joint bled, pretty much on the 48 hr mark. \n\nI have had mixed results with the long lasting factors.  Did not have really great results with Alprolix.  On Rebinyne now which seems to be working for the most part. \n\nI am really just trying to get a patient perspective.

So that is all been taken into account.\n\nI do not know for sure, but I get the impression that the people who needed to take steroids did not experience physical symptoms.  Their need for the steroid intervention was indicated by elevated LFTs and a dip in FIX activity level.  That is why we had our blood drawn twice a week for the first 12 weeks.  Is that still the plan for Phase 3? If I am Remeber correctly the people who had expression in the 70% range had the highest dose of vector.

", "Is there a treatment for B like Hemlibra for Hemophilia A ? Was talking to a friend who lives in other country which is also hemophilic and talked about Hemlibra and he said there is not for Hemophilia B, is that true ? If so, why ? K understand the difference between is the factor we have deficiency in produce XIII and IX, but there should be no problem there, right? The principle is the same. It is possible that it is just demand - there are more people with Haem A out there than B. \nOr it could be that it was an easier thing to make work. Principal is not quite the same as the factors have slightly different roles in the clotting cascade... I imagine with time it will catch up. Or just skip to gene therapy... Hemlibra is a bispecific antibody that plays the role of FVIIIa by acting as a scaffold for FIX and FX. To my knowledge, there is not a similar option for FIX.\n\nEdited to add: I think you would need to activate FX independently of FIX, and the only current option for that is to use NovoSeven, which activates FX via the extrinsic pathway. I am not sure that something stable like an antibody would work for this purpose. But hopefully I am wrong! There is not a similar option for Factor IX patients and probably never will be, though some of the subcutaneous TFPI or similar could be a somewhat similar treatment option for patients with disorders besides hemophilia A. The reason is that for the purposes of clotting, factor VIII has the relatively simple job of holding IX and X together in the correct manner to allow IX to activate X through serine protease activity. VIII is just a binding molecule, and as it turns out, that binding job can be done exceptionally well using an engineered antibody. VIII is unique though in being this sort of binding protein, and making a monoclonal antibody that does FIX job of essentially precisely cutting up FX just is not feasible.\n\nTLDR: Factors 8 and 9 actually have very different biomechanical purposes in the clotting chain, and though the activity of VIII can be emulated with an antibody, the activity of IX can not. Try checking fitusiran. But the trial for that are halted I think. My friend with IX takes it and it is once per month dose. Thanks for the explanation.

My sister's VW test came back as 56, and she is now being sent to a specialist in another state for more testing. Is it possible to have Von Willebrand problems even if the test is technically normal? And how do I go about talking to my resistant doctor about this?\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nMy doctor (in fact, the whole clinic where she works) is kind of dismissive. I only heard about or asked for a VW test because my sister was diagnosed with it after a particularly bad period, during which I had to take her to the ER.\n\nI have also always had heavy periods (although I did not realize how heavy compared to the average until just a few years ago). We are talking 7 to 9 days in the past and now creeping up toward 14 not being unusual. There have also been a few times where I was afraid I needed to go to the ER myself (a super plus tampon completely soaked every 15 minutes), but did not because I was afraid I would be dismissed as silly. In the last two years, things have gotten particularly bad, and my doctors at the clinic I go to just kind of wave me away. This morning I have been going through a super plus tampon every hour and feeling frustrated with my doctors.\n\nAnyway, when my sister told me about her diagnosis, I thought it might be an answer for me as well, so I asked my doctor about it. She kept saying she would get around to ordering it for weeks! Finally, it was another doctor that I saw on walk-in who put in the order. My tests came back just above normal (52 out of a 50 to 200 range), but my doctor took this as just dismissing VW disease as a possible cause of my problems. I was skeptical (what is the margin of error on these tests?), but I kind of just went with it, while still questioning in the back of my mind.\n\nIn the meantime, my sister was referred to a hematologist, who referred her to an even higher specialist in a completely different state. So, I asked what her numbers were on her VW test because I still was not sure my own numbers should have been ruled out as a possible problem. Her result was 56. Higher than mine. My number was slightly worse than hers, I am also having scary periods, and yet her doctor and even the hematologist thought it was worth looking into more.\n\nSo, I guess I am just wondering how Von Willebrand disease is determined and also just venting my frustrations about feeling dismissed from medical providers. Thanks. Okay here is the thing, rare bleeding disorders are often overlooked and dismissed. VW fits in that. You may end up having to try several doctors before you find one that takes you seriously. Keep trying. Maybe just straight ask for a referral to a hematologist. If your doctor will not, time to find a new doctor. Be the squeaky wheel.

Definitely going to try harder in my search if I do not hear back by tomorrow though. :\\\n\nThanks for the emotional reassurance. There are different types of von Willebrand Disease. With some types, it is possible to have vWF levels in the normal range, but for the factor proteins to not function properly. The journey toward accurate diagnosis can be a long and challenging one, but you are not alone. I recommend checking out the Hemophilia Federation of America and seeing if there are meetup groups or educational opportunities near you. Thanks! I will check it out. I might be a little remote for a meetup, but it is worth looking into. Getting a diagnosis of VWD can be really hard because your levels can fluctuate. That said, because it is a genetic disorder and your sister is being referred for further diagnostics is a pretty good indication of *something* your doc should be paying attention to. Unfortunately, VWD is still rare and a lot of docs are unfamiliar with it. So, you are going to have to advocate for yourself really hard. Push the issue with your doc. Because even though the most common symptom for women is heavy periods, it is still a bleeding disorder, so if you get in a car accident\u2014or get pregnant\u2014you are going to need that diagnosis.\n\nThere are some resources that can help on the website BetterYouKnow. (It is from NHF and the CDC, not a pharma site). If you look at the \u201cWomen/At Risk\u201d section it can help you understand the tests and how to prepare. There is a lot of good info. \n\nAlso, are you having these talks with your gyno or your regular doctor? A OB/GYN might be more familiar with VWD and be able to get you the referral to a hematologist you need.\n\nAnd yeah, having to fight to be listened to sucks. Not sure what state you are in as how well the Medicaid system works varies some by state.  In every state the HTC system (hemophilia treatment centers) should be covered by Medicaid.  Some states have many htcs some have very few.  I would start by calling the HTC nearest you and explaining your situation to them.\n\nYou can find your nearest HTC here: ", "Im hemophiliac and a police cadet I have mild type A hemophilia and I am in the process of being a police officer, in my country to be an officcer it is 4 years and I am in the 2nd, of course as a hemophiliac I have had health-related problems but I do not know why or how they have only been bruises or things related like that and it surprises me too much since we do a lot of exercise since in the process it is required and is also used as a sanction, I could say that every day we do exercises such as running, push-ups, advancing using the elbows and the tips of the feet and a long list for those who know those exercises typical of the military culture ... the most complicated thing in my process has undoubtedly been the external cuts, I still do not understand how nothing has ever happened to my knee, ankles, elbows since It is very common in hemophiliacs, only bruises in sectors near there, but in relation to the cuts I have had two that have been complicated, once while I was cutting a paper with my scissors for a job I cut my finger a little or with the scissors and literally I bleed for about 8 hours and I had to squeeze my finger with patches and super strong adhesive tape for up to 15 hours (obviously I slept with that kind of tourniquet) and I had taken pills with traxenic acid that I took as 10 and also put ground pills on my finger and the 2nd was quite similar but with the razors on one finger (due to bad handling) I was able to hide my wounds and bleeding ... so my post goes to the following. How is it possible that with all the exercise I do I have never damaged a joint? And I would like to know your opinion to know that a hemophiliac is in the process of being a policeman and that he hides it to fulfill his dreams?(sorry for bad english, im from south america) I am a moderate hemophiliac (Type A 6%) and did not have many serious bleeds in my younger years. I did not know I had hemophilia until I got my wisdom teeth removed and kept bleeding despite all the stitches I received. It was not until senior year that repeated pressure and joint cracking over a year caused a bleed inside my left knee joint. What I am trying to say is that depending on your factor levels/ personal health/ age/ lifestyle, you may not suffer joint bleeds like more severe hemophiliacs do. I assume from all the excercise you do you are fairly fit and that protects you from bleeds as well. \n\nTo answer your second question about the police academy, I do not know how it is in South America but here in the states I believe having hemophilia exempts you from working in these careers due to the dangerous work environment. I would say sure, you could keep it a secret from your employers if this job is your dream but always keep in mind that if someone assaults you on the job and you get seriously injured it could become a life threatening situation and your department will likely find out about your condition anyways. \n\nMy best advice is be safe, put your health and well being first. There are other jobs in law enforcement with less impact on your body like detective work for example that you might like as well. Just keep your mind open to other possibilities but if policing is your true calling, then do not let your condition slow you down. Just be cautious and careful. (Also, keep your factor medicine ready to go in case of an emergency, and have a plan with your medical provider!) Goodluck! You are a lucky Hemophiliac to say the least. I am an American, 27 yr old who wanted to be in the force all my life but I have had ankle fusion and years and years of pain/bleeding to multiple joints predominately right ankle and left elbow. I too exercise frequently but still get bleeds even when giving Factor XIII. I do push ups, pull ups, bridges, lots of stretching but still manage to get a bleed in a joint. Maybe your factor levels are not reaching 0% after a few days depending on the half-life leading to you having little to no bleeds in your joints. It could also be you have taken care of yourself by not getting injured as you only listed two bleeding issues.. Most Hemophiliacs suffer from thousands of bleeds from nose bleeds to getting hurt to getting into accidents all by the time they reach their mid 20s and it limits you from doing many extracurricular activities for the remainder of your life. To be more specific, I used to be able to lift weights on both arms normally. Up..down..up..down. Recently I have had to stop weight lifting entirely. I have discovered, each rep I do on my left arm, my elbow tissue tears and it hurts which will ultimately lead to a bleed. My left elbow is my second targeted joint which means its prone to facing inflammation. My right elbow however is flawless as it is part of my dominant arm and since I can remember.., my right arm has always been perfect. No bleeds ever. Exercise does strengthen your bones, muscles, keeps brain activity to healthy levels, etc. Sounds safe to say that your joints may be quite healthy. I would like to ask what and which Factor do you take and how often? Im severe B and I can track periods of my life based on bleeds. For instance before I was 10 all of my bleeds were in my right knee. Then years later it went to my left knee, then my right elbow, then my left elbow. I would bleed constantly in the joints where I had once had a bleed but never until I had that first breakout. I had never had an elbow bleed before the age of 20. After that, elbows became my worst bleeding issues. I guess what I am trying to get at is (in my opinion, which is not a medical one) if you manage to avoid that first bleed in any particular joint you are good as gold. When you do have then first bleed you may set off down a rocky trail.\n\nBeing mild type A without any bleeding history of which I assume you are at least 18 years old is excellent and maybe there is a chance you will never have any issues, especially with medical advancements. There is the chance though, especially in a job that may put serious stress on you, that you could end up with some health issues you have not experienced before. I would just say make sure you put serious thought into it and decide what is best for your mental health, physical health, and your happiness. I wish you the best. &gt;And I would like to know your opinion to know that a hemophiliac is in the process of being a policeman and that he hides it to fulfill his dreams?\n\nHey, that is up to you. But be prepared to be sacked the moment they find out you have lied about a serious medical condition. \n\nAlso, lying about one thing generally makes you less trustworthy when it comes to other things. Your job is one of honesty and service. Okay my guy, firstly, nothing can stop you. Try to be on prophylaxis while doing heavy excercises, ik this stuff because I gym, and i have severe haemophilia. I always try to be on prophylaxis, hope that would help you too :) I occupy factor viii, the last time I needed it was because I had a wound right in the vein since I had several blood tests for another problem, I had a radmiolysis that happened to me due to the physical demand that I had in the academy at the end of the 1st year, to make a better recovery from the injury, they did blood tests (obviously to know if I have hemophilia are more specific things) and in that, the nurse took the needle out of my arm badly (they always drew blood in it, it is my mistake) and I did not stop bleeding for about 10 hours, obviously I tried everything to stop that bleeding but because it was right in the vein and it was very small, it was not possible for example to tighten the wound ... I must say that when they gave me the factor was a matter of seconds when the blood stopped ... I was really shocked That means you do have Hemophilia but you were not aware of whether Factor would help or not with the bleeding. Factor is the only thing that will help you stop your bleeding. For future purposes, 10 hours of bleeding is dangerous. Sure you may not have bad joints, but you will develop something just as bad if you allow yourself to bleed for your a lengthy period of time. Factor up and take care of yourself. O ok mild type A.

My 3 yo son has mildly hemophilia A (12%). Last weak he fell while running. He had a bump (do not know if it is the right english word) on the forehead and a bruise. Now after a week, the bruise has almost gone, but the bump seems bigger. Do you think having him injected now could have a positive effect on it ? Or it is useless and I have to wait. Thanks in advance. Hi there. I am severe, not mild, so the treatment strategies my doctors told me to follow will not be the same as the ones recommended for your son. That said, the rule of thumb for me growing up was always over treating is far better than under treating a potential bleed. I would have been infused asap after the bump and regularly afterward. And seeing as its the head maybe an mri too. I had to get one after a car accident when I was little. \n\nBut like I said, it is a little different for milds. The only good advice you should get here is to give his hematologist a call. The folks at my HTC have always been very helpful when it comes to this stuff, so I am sure yours will too. I hope this gets resolved for you soon and painlessly.\n\nAlso, its always important with head injuries to keep an eye out for slurred speech, dizziness, confusion, or any other signs of a change in cognitive function. Hopefully it is nothing to worry about, but it is always something to be on the lookout for. I has not any sign of pain or any of the ones you said in the last paragraph. Unfortunately, I do not trust my hematologist at 100%, and even less the hospitals around me, that are not competent to say the least...But I will go to make him injected anyway I think, if it cannot hurt it , it is the principal. I know it may sound egoistic but I am scared to have him injected if it is not necessary...Thank you for your answer. Howdy! I am a haemophiliac type A severe ( less than 1%) and I feel qualified enough to answer this, I usually get a lot of bleeds that I walk it off and try just applying ice to the area if it is hot. Honestly, it is just experience, most of the time we know what is the severity of the bleed.  \nNow talking about the bleed, it is on the forehead it is an important place and not to be neglected. \nBut all I want to ask you is, how is your son, is he crying, or feeling uncomfortable? And also is the swelling(bump) still hot? If you do not want to take a risk and have insurance, I recommend you get him injected with 250 IU (or according to his weight), head is not a place to take risks on. If it is on something like a shoulder or bare skin you can take risks. You mentioned that it is already been a week so if he is still feeling quite well and you can go for it, and also answer my questions which I asked above. \n\nHere are some common mistakes you might make while rising him \n\nDo not take risks on places such as head, Hip and near heart \nDo not apply ANY sorts of balms or medicines without the consent of your haematologist\nPlease visit your haemotologist immediately if the bleed is on testicles or urinary tract \nFinger injuries are the worst trust me he is going to cry a lot there \nApply ice regularly \nPurpleness do not matter the swelling (bump) matters \n\nPlease answer the questions asked above \nI might have not been straight forward in my answers but I do not want to make your son suffer from these common mistakes  I am a mild (6%). Also suffered a head injury or two....or a few in my day. Lol. \n\nA few things... If I may.  Do your dead level best to fight that fear of having him infused. With very VERY few exceptions it is harmless. If he has no bleeds, no injuries, nothing... The clotting factor will just loiter in his blood stream and do nothing until it degrades and his body removes it like any other protein in our bodies. As long as he does not get much more of the clotting factor a normal body SHOULD have he will not have any ill effects. And it is always possible he has minor bleeds you do not even know about because they are not visually significant or causing pain/discomfort. Especially in smaller children. So an errant dose of clotting factor has the potential to fix something you did not even know was a problem. \n\nAs to the head injury... I took quite a fall as a toddler. Torn open about an inch and a half of my forehead. Much clotting factor and stitches ensued... As the injury healed it left a pocket with a fibrous cyst on my skull. Became an issue for several months, was easily bumped and caused more bleeds. Eventually the decision was made for it to be surgically removed. Now, this is not typical... And in no terms am I suggesting this is what is happening with your boy... I am no doctor. But I was a hemophiliac latch key kid with severe ADHD-Hyperactive Type who spent WAY too much time unsupervised... What i can say is that blood definitely belongs in our vascular systems. And potentially bad things can occur when it gets into other places. From fibrous cysts to compartment syndrome... None of which is good for him. I do not mean to sound like a doomsayer but It is important that persistent or new/unusual bumps, especially ones at a prior bleed site be investigated. \n\nMay I ask why you do not trust your hematologist? Is he not a HTC doctor or is he inexperienced with Hemophilia? I have definitely met some where my faith in them dissolved pretty quickly when it became clear they would never had a hemophiliac in clinic before.\n\nEdit: Relocated post, removed from thread to stand alone. Not crying, not feeling pain. The bruise is almost gone. Swelling (thanks) not hot. He fell while running, and he was wearing an helmet, so some of the shock must have been absorbed. I do not trust my hematologist that much because he already saud some things, then the complete opposite the next time. He is an HTC doctor btw. Also the nurses from the hospitals really do not know how to make an injection, each time they try many times, and while my son is brave, after the fourth or fifth try of injection, he become stressed, so am i ( and i do not talk about his veins after). The fibrous cyst is what is worrying the most right now. I know , even if i am not a doctor, that the shock was not that important as he fell while running and he was wearing an helmet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called the HTC center anyway, there is a new doctor that said that we must monitor the swelling from now. If it gets any bigger, we will go inject him; if not, it is not too severe so me should wait and see, and still monitor of course. Thank you very much for your answer. You can just ignore it if you are confident enough, but is it warm? Inexperienced nurses so common, take care! Little brave man holding pain Infuse Especially if it is a bigger hospital and not just an HTC you can try this... You may piss off a nurse or two... But if they consistently cannot get a vein... Ask for a phlebotomist from the lab. All those people do all day everyday is get a needle into a vein. Period. Every nurse is trained in phlebotomy but not every nurse is only a phlebotomist. I have terrible veins. Many of them roll most of them are thin they blow out constantly and the whole mess of them can barely even be seen through the skin. Nurses hate me. Well.... They hate my veins. When I was younger my mother would insist sometimes that they bring a phlebotomist from the lab if there was repeated difficulty infusing me. No matter how many times the nurses tried and failed I think I have only had a phlebotomist fail to get a blood return once. If it is a great concern for you you might consider giving it a try could not hurt to ask. \n\nAs for the Hematologist, medicine is complex. It takes longer to become a specialist physician than almost any other profession on earth. Unfortunately care can be very circumstantial. Do this if this. Do this instead of not. Do this this time because of... You get the idea. Things can change from visit to visit and from circumstance.to circumstance. If the doctor contradicts themselves... Ask why. \"Last time when this happened you said this, why are you saying this other thing now instead? What is different.\" If they are unwilling to explain then they need to work on their bedside manners. Call another HTC and ask if you can speak with THEIR hematologist. Explain what is going on and that you cannot get good answers from yours. Patient care is more than just prescriptions. It is also taking care of the patient's concerns and educating them about their own condition or in this case, about your son's. Because you are his caregiver you NEED to know. And should have the right to ask. \n\nYou are your son's best advocate until he finds a voice of his own. \n\nMy brother and I both have hemophilia. It was so difficult for my mom when we were growing up. I still cannot fully grasp how difficult it was for her, a normally timid woman, to have to learn to demand care. To demand consideration from hospital staff. To demand, sometimes quite loudly, to have her concerns taken seriously. I have a better idea now that I am grown but i was so oblivious as a child. I lived it from the other side, as the child, but I have deep respect for you and your struggle. But you are here, you are asking and learning and not being passive in your son's care. You are doing good! Like  said, infuse immediately but only if his Hematologist told you to do so. Why? Because there is internal bleeding that you physically cannot see. That is the nature of hemophilia. I am severe A but from the answers here I am quite skeptical that many people were not educated by their Hematologist and it seems like you do not trust your Hematologist. I went from having nose bleeds, to having a targeted joint affected, to becoming a cripple and now I am actually walking pain free and doing all my daily activities except for sports. I was on Prophylaxis for as long as 20 years then in 2021, I switched over to a weekly building block infusion known as Hemlibra. It is a bit different than Factor XIII in the sense that your body will keep 30% Factor levels at all times throughout a 7 day period. Keeping factor levels at 30% which allows Hemophiliacs to do all activities without much worry. When I was younger, it was always infusion(based on body weight), ice, rest. Even if a feather hit me, i would have internal bleeding (a small bruise is internal bleeding whether you can see black and blue or not). I know how dangerous it IS.. it does not matter what your son says, he cannot see internal bleeding. An mri may not be needed as he had a helmet on which is totally understandable but he most likely may have low factor levels if he has Hemophilia. I wish I could go back in time to listen to what the docs said so I would have had an easier time throughout my life but I did not infuse as directed due to being a lazy potato. Yes, you heard that right. I never liked to infuse every 48 hours(prophylaxis) and so my health deteriorated until I became old enough to realize how badly I screwed my body over.. So please contact a different Hematologist (use Google and make the phone call) and find out if he needs to infuse factor. I do not know much about treating for mild hemophilia but any injury to the head or chest should probably be treated with an infusion of factor The phlebotomist is a great idea, I will ask if there is one. For the doctor, it is not that he tried something, then say to try the opposite after; it is more like he say we must do something, then the next that we must not, then when I say he told us the opposite the last time, he responds that he has never told such thing...he is quite old, I think he is losing his memory, which is confirmed by the fact that each visit seems like the first one ( so what is his name? How much factor has he ? Do you already have him infused ? How many times ? Like he has no file about him...) But I learned today that he will quit soon and that he will be replaced; the new one seems to be better, so I hope it will be confirmed. Respect for your mother. Thanks for your answers, and for your kind words. I will improve and always do my best. Yes thanks. Done, we will monitor  and infuse if needed. I am a mild with fviii levels ranging from 13-22. As an adult, I have permanent damage from being undertreated as a mild. When my bleeds started increasing with age (and I exercise a lot and am really active) my doc started me on prophy. At age 46! It changed my life. I am no longer in daily pain and am much more active.\n\nWhen in doubt, reach out to your doc or ask for imaging to see if there is a bleed. There is a Facebook group for milds called mild matters.\n\nDo you have a good HTC that recognizes milds bleed too? We just made a scan. Nothing really worrying, but the swelling will last months... I find when they are not treated immediately they can then take months to go away. If I treat right away it can resolve more quickly.\n\nAs a mild, I question more and that has caused issues sometimes. Yeah, I fucked up... I would not say that... I would say you had a learning opportunity and will do things differently next time. As I mentioned, I have only been on prophy for a little over  a year and a half. In January I totally missed a shoulder bleed that resulted in a series of shoulder issues I am still healing from. We are always learning.

I only use and only have been using my elbow creases for quite some years now. Used to use tops of hands but they can roll alot.  I am older now so my skin is pretty thin there now.\n\nMy back up is the top of the forearm or the inside of the the wrist. Never tried anything in my legs. \n\nMostly I stuck to elbows.  I have two good veins on each elbow .  Although the veins closet to the inside does have a bit of an awkward angle. Use a 27G butterfly if you are not already. When I did vein injections I only used the back of my hands. Top of your hand there are 2 sites for frequent infusion I used my hands until my teens and moves to my ACs since then 27g... top of hand. Inside of wrist. Top of wrist... I rotate through about five... If you have trouble with back of hand - try holding it in warm water for about 5 mins before you try with the needle. Helps the veins dilate/easier to see &amp; stick. Ankles. It was strange in the beginning. But i have massive veins there. And its easy to hide. Once you put socks on, nobody knows anything. I like to keep my Hemophilia to my self. I have been using the 3 same veins for at least 15 years. Back of my hand, closest yo mu knuckles. I use my hands a lot so I find those veins a lot easier than my arms. I use 27G butterflies and it really helps with keeping the scar tissue to a minimum. I am right handed but I inject with my left hand, makes sense, because my right hand has better veins.\n\nI do have a very fat wrist vein, but it rolls like a tire, so it just sits there and teases me on bad vein poke days.\n\nI usually take a hot shower before a poke, helps to get nice a warm. Also drinking lots of water gets them juicy. you are brave, I have been poked in the ankle ONCE, and it was traumatic at best. I was also 4 and in the ER. I feel the same sometimes but it can be beneficial for a friend to know in case you have an accident. The ONE time I got a foot stick I reflexively kicked that poor nurse in the head. I told him it was a terrible idea... I felt horrible and apologized profusely. To his credit he did just say, \"yup you were right... Bad idea.\" I kicked up INTO the needle and as you might imagine nothing good happened. The needle did some significant damage inside my foot. Created a whole new bleeding problem. Only way we go for feet injection round two is if it is life or death. \ud83e\udd23 The top of my hands are easy for me. Inner elbow is best but top of the hand works great too! Make sure you are super hydrated (I prefer to drink a big Gatorade or water) then take a super super hot shower so my hand veins really pop. Makes it easier Mate try wrists and hands  but DO NOT TOUCH LEGS it is a terrible idea and ur wasting ur time and factor I use the back of my hands, have for 40 yrs. Tried different places over the years. Top of the foot, forearm, etc. Always easier to just go to the spots I am used to. hehe .. It hurts only first 4-5 times. After that the skin gets thick and the pain reduces a lot. How do you prevent those 3 veins from collapsing? Hmm, good question! I started off using 25G butterflies, but they were too big and I was blowing my veins all the time.\n\nOnce I switched to 27G (the needle for babies) it was so much better. In theory, the 27 makes smaller holes, thus making smaller scars in the vein. I try not to poke in the same spot, but going above or below my last injection site.\n\nStaying hydrated is really important to keeping veins visible and bouncy. It prevents you from going right through the vein with the needle (which I have done before).\n\nI do try other veins when they all pop up really well, so I have a couple back ups. I am also slightly brown so my veins are harder to see, I usually go by feel.\n\nHonestly, I have been self infusing since I was 12/13, and I am 33 now. It took a solid year for me to get it right to be honest! I messed up so much. I switched back to 27G, the yellow ones, after 29G was no longer available on my market.

Is it similar to Hemlibra? Well I think so, but I am not entirely sure how Hemlibra works. Fitusiran sharply reduces antithrombin 3 which is the enzyme that breaks down blood blots. So basically it lets my blood clot using the other factors the body has, even with the missing factor VIII protein. Wow. No, this is completely different I am pretty sure. Hemlibra works by tricking your body into thinking it has factor 8 by using a dead virus of sorts to reproduce a factor 8 like link that connects to factor 7&amp;9 to make the chain of factors hook together, so it is like there is a fake factor 8 there to hold the chain together (crude description I know, I do not really get how it works, but that is the gist of it). \nThat is crazy that there is something that works the way you have described.

So I am in my early 30s now, and if I had to describe the state of my elbow in the most positive way possible, I would say it is...really not great. Obviously I am sure a lot of you can relate with various joints. \n\nSo, obviously we still need to exercise, especially strength train as tolerated. I want to protect my joints, not to mention I do not want my muscles to wither away to nothing. I am trying my best to do things that do not irritate my elbow too much, but I really cannot put any load through the joint without a moderate amount of pain that lasts for days after exercising. And that goes doubly for actually actively moving my elbow while it is under load. \n\nFor me, things like bench press and free weight exercises that involve moving my elbow through it is range of motion are a no-go. I have been trying to do some shoulder, chest, and back stuff with free weights and machines where I basically hold my elbow in a static position while moving my shoulders, but even that causes some lingering pain. I am probably going to have to adjust my current routine, but not totally sure yet.\n\nCurious to hear about some of y'alls experiences, how you have adapted, etc. How much pain do you guys put up with before deciding a certain exercise/movement/whatever is not going to work out? I am finding it pretty tough to work out my upper body without really pissing off my elbow. Do you have an HTC that you go to? Seeing a physical therapist who specializes in hemophilia would probably really help. Are you open to swimming and water aerobics? \n\nI have pretty bad hemophilic arthropathy in an elbow, reduced range of motion of elbow and rotation of wrist from the elbow.\n\nI swam competitively through high school, still swim a little now. \n\nI would just say go light weights, it is going to get frustrating but there is almost no fixes or good long term outcomes for the elbow on us. I have one of the most widely regarded orthopedic surgeons that works on hemophiliacs at my HTC and he was pretty blunt, the success rates at fixing elbows is generally low even in the non bleeder population, and even if they do you will have a LIFETIME weight lifting/holding limit of 5 lbs because the artificial replacement joint will pull out of the bone as it is a hanging limb. \n\nWhat I did end up having done to my elbow was that the ulnar nerve(funny bone) path had to get cleaned out because the bone damage was pinching the funny bone nerve and it would feel like that all the time or the pinky to ring finger and up my arm would go numb.\n\nI guess if you not already, get good at being able to tell if it is nerve pain, inflammation pain, or hitting hard limits of bone obstruction pain. Inflammation can be treated anti inflammatories, nerve pain can be cleaned up surgically sometimes, but the hard limits we just have to know where they are and not slam into them. 5 lbs of vegan poop being burned provides 37582.82 BTU 5 lbs is 2.27 kg 5 lbs is 2.27 kg If you can see a hemophilia trained physical therapist that would be super helpful. I am sure you do not want to hear this, but if you are experiencing any pain, that is too much IMO. Pain almost always equals a bleed. Unless you are absolutely certain it is arthritis pain, and you can tell the exact moment when a bleed starts, any pain is too much. I recommend only weight training legs and core, and swim the rest of the time for upper body stuff. Elbow bleeds are the absolute worst, I feel for you. The only way I have ever been able to make progress (and I have, a great deal) is to spend the 6 months or whatever it takes to let all of the bleed resolve, until all of the swelling and pain is to where you know it is the best it can be, until you have as much range of motion as you are capable of, then start really slowly. This is where the PT comes in. A good physical therapist, especially one who understands hemophilia can help more than anything else. They know so much about the body and how to gain muscle without causing injury.  If you cannot find one I seriously recommend putting down the weights and swimming. Even if you cannot swim, tread water, and use water weights. The gain may be slower in a perfect world, but it will be faster when you consider that you will not be set back 2 months every time you over due it. Good luck. There is always a progression you can handle. Find yours and give it time. It is a long haul I was told I had two options: replacement or fusion. They were not actually sure a replacement would work bc how my ulna sticks out now.  The angle is all wrong now. \n\nFortunately they were ae to resolve the constant bleeding with a debridment.  Kicked the can down the road. \n\nH My elbow used to be really bad. No muscle, chronic pain, would lock up.  I could not do a curl with a 1lb weight.  Used to use small cans of food.\n\nJust prior to the pandemic, I enrolled in a gene therapy study.  I now have constant low levels of factor.  I also use to the last 1.5 years to exercise.  I can now curl 15 to 20lbs. I am able to do pushups again.\n\nYou have two issues: exercising your elbow and excersing the rest of your body.  Should look into brace for elbow.  I had a custom neoprene brace that had two metal hinges along the side.  It also had pins in the hinges  that could restrict the range of movement.   Something like this might help to support your elbow so you can do shoulder exercise your shoulder.\n\nFor your elbow, it will be slow going.  Make sure you infuse and just move it through its range.  No weights.  Use resistance bands instead of weights.  Weights put force on the joint where bands will not. Ice it as well.  There is not a lot of tissue surrounding the joint so icing will work reduce the pain.  It will be Slow.  Do not give up.\n\nAnd as others have suggested, talk to a physiotherapist which specializes in Hemophilia. They will be able to give you some customized exercising for your specific issues.\n\nThings like aquafit are also good.  I personally found water resistance was still too much in terms of pain. My left elbow is a target joint, and not going to lie, it is a pain to weight train. Here is my opinions:\n\n1. Talk to your HTC and a Physical Therapist\n\n2. Some water resistance exercise like at a pool that reduces impact on the joints. It is boring, and feels a little lame, but it works.\n\n3. Low weight, and slowly increase reps. Sometimes if I am feeling extra cautious, instead of weights, I use resistance rubber bands for some exercises. It is sucks having to do more reps with low weight/bands, but it is so much safer. \n\n4. Yoga, I know... but yoga is great for stretching out those muscles. I kept getting a bleed in my arm, that turned out to be caused by my shoulder and neck muscles being too tight. Everything is connected\n\n5. No one can tell you how your body feels, and the pain tolerance, except for you and your doctor/PT. There is no clear cut indicator of when to stop. \n\n6. If you can, I highly recommend talking to your HTC about something like Helimbra, it is helped control my joint and micro bleeds so much better than I ever thought it could. I used to be a swimmer, but swimming laps irritates my elbow too much these days. I basically cannot move it through it range of motion without increasing pain over time. Currently I am doing isomerics for my bicep and tricep with either resistance bands or a light dumbbell. I need to look into one of these braces. My HTC told me about it but of course they never follow up, and I get busy and just put it off. I am going to have to pester them for a PT appointment.\n\nGlad to hear you have made a lot of progress! Curious what your ROM is like? I am at about -40 extension, limited flexion as well but I forget the number, somewhere between 120-130 I think. Curls really irritate my ulnar nerve. May end up getting a decompression or transposition sometime in the next couple years. I do not have any issues with bleeding, my regimen works great thankfully. Hemlibra actually worked less well for me than Eloctate, YMMV. I would like to do yoga but my elbow ROM is so restricted I can barely do any of the poses that involve putting weight through your arms, at least without  them feeling extremely awkward. My ROM is pretty limited in my elbow, it is locked so I have about 25\u00b0 of movement left in it. I have a fake knee and hip too, so I cannot do the bigger yoga stuff, but between that and my PT I learned a lot stuff about stretching and cheats to do things.\n\nLike push ups, instead of doing normal ones, I do stand up angled ones against the wall or a doorway. It is less weight and impact on my joints. Then some of the stuff in yoga class I could not do, I took to the pool, and did them in the water where it is easier. \n\nThe main goal is just more education, to learn more, so you can adjust for yourself and your needs. \n\nAs for the Eloctate, I can understand that, I was on that before Helimbra, and it is a huge change, bc you do not have the \"highs\" of Eloctate. I am severe and I have only had one breakthrough bleed in a year since switching where I over did it, and got a back bleed. Everyone is different though, and I am glad Eloctate works for ya, like I said I loved Eloctate as well. \n\nGood luck in a solution that works for you, as I approach 40, it is getting tougher and tougher to stay in shape.  Yeah it is a struggle, but worth taking the time to figure it out for sure! I threw my hands up in the air for a long time because I wanted to exercise without limitations like I used to, but that was not a great idea and was immature lol. I would like to say I have always been mature about my hemophilia, but I just spent the summer hurting myself attempting to do backflips off the diving board for the first time in 15 yrs bc I was determined to fight 22 yr old me.\n\nI eventually did it, but even a few weeks later   those big bones under your toes before the arch are still sore as fuck lol. My range is  pretty good now.  Lost 10 or 15 degrees in both extension and flexion but do not notice.\n\nI have had 3 surgeries on my elbow and the truth is there is not much of a joint any more.  The humeruss has moved down the ulna,, so my ulna sticks out about an inch in the back now.  If I bleed the blood just moves into the forearm so I do not get that intense pressure like a typical joint bleed.\n\nI used to use the brace alot, now I do not use it at all.  I do take Celebrex and gapapentin though, although those are more for the ankles.  Curls used to bother me but I really took it slow.  Tricept extensions are my krytponite.  The crunching and pain.  So I use resistance bands for them.\n\nHonestly it is a visious cycle, the more muscle helps stabilize the joint.  However, exercise can cause more problems.  It really is a matter of getting over that initial hump. Slow and steady Agree with all of these.  It can be hard taking things slow, sometimes feels like you are getting no improvement.

I had been prescribed Ben Gay and Fastum Gel before but stopped using them once I realised they were made from salicylic acid, which is aspirin. \n\nSo I switched to Voltaren which is made from Diclofenac somewhat successfully as in did not seem to cause bleeding but I was getting side effect. \n\nWhich cream do you use for sprains and any side effects (especially the salicylic acid-based ones)? I have not been prescribed anything topical but I have had tried most everything available over the counter at one time or another.  The only thing that remotely distracted me from real pain were products that contained capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers.  The reason it worked was because the burning sensation on my skin distracted me from the joint pain.  It helped me through some pretty rough nights but I have not used it in years.  Since switching to a prophylaxis regiment I have not had any of those miserable situations.  If you can stand it, ice is always the most helpful in the long run.  Of course it is also a great inconvenience.  Good luck.  I realised that it was muscle pain as it resolved after a few sessions of  applying the cream of the muscle preceding the joint area. \n\nWhat is the brand of the capsaicin cream you used?  I like BioFreeze. No idea if it contains anything like aspirin. But it seems to work well to numb the area a bit. Does not appear to be. The active ingredient is listed as menthol on its website. \n\nIf menthol works, would stuff like Vicks work too?  I would assume so; ultimately its either capcasin to heat or menthol to cool... or both, ie: IcyHot.\n\nThe issue is the smell. Menthol based products like Aspercreme, Vicks, etc are pretty potent. I would not use them at work. I have tried the unscented versions and IMO they do not work as well. YMMV. I will go get a bottle of Vicks tomorrow to try out. I will second the recommendation for capsaicin cream. My orthopedist recommended it after he diagnosed osteoarthritis in my shoulder and it seemed to help. Of course, that is bone/joint pain and may not be as helpful for a sprain, but it is still useful to have around.\n\nI ended up just using a pharmacy brand cream where capsaicin was the only active ingredient. I used Zostrix brand when I could find it but as long as the active ingredient is capsaicin it should do the same thing.  Just a heads up, the cream interacts with water, like when your in the shower and can feel even hotter.  It probably has something to do with the water opening your pores but I am just guessing.  Also, if I wrapped the area with a neoprene brace it also got much hotter.  An Ace bandage might do the same thing but I used it on my knees almost exclusively and I had neoprene braces I wore on my knees that really turned up the heat.  Start with a small amount and go from there until you figure it out.  There were times it got uncomfortably hot with a neoprene brace or hot water on the area. Did you just go up to the pharmacist and ask for a cream with capsaicin as the only active ingredient? Do they know these kind of stuff? They may, but you can also look at the back of the box. There is a listing of active ingredients and inactive ingredients separately. For example, Walgreens has a store brand cream with only capsaicin listed as an active ingredient. Try TENS What is TENS?  I am not 100% sure, but Absorbine Jr has Menthol, Camphor, and Wormwood herb in their products.

He would done testing on me months ago and my VW factor was low-ish but not like... super low or anything. He did not seem concerned about it at the time. I had one done many years ago. I was not fasting. Sodium of 134 with DDAVP might mean something like a sports drink could help - I would just avoid drinking straight water if possible, but you likely will not really feel thirsty. Asking during the test is probably the best idea.

I am not sure how your migraines manifest or if they feel differently than a \"normal\" headache for you, but I am not really familiar with migraines and DDAVP so much.

You get blood drawn right before, 30 minutes in, an hour in, and then 4 hours after. Afterwards, you are free to go. One of the most major restrictions is you cannot have straight water. Soda, gatorade, juice is fine, but you cannot have plain water. Anything with electrolytes fine, just no plain water. You also cannot have over a certain amount of liquid but that is determined by your weight. I think it has to do with your kidneys slowing down or something but I do not really fully remember. The doctor will give you more information though. Overall bring stuff to entertain yourself, a gatorade, and be prepared for a long day.

My name is Ludvig and i am a hemophiliac type A moderate form with 4% of factor VIII.\n\nI just joined this subreddit and I must say that i am stoked to for the first time in my life talk to other people with the same disease. When I was a kid my HTC offered these camps for hemophilic children but 10 year old me apparently was not interested. Maybe I had to grow up to realize that it is not something to be ashamed of. Now I also realize that I truly need to talk to others in the same situation to both learn how to cope better with my feelings but also how to act smarter about my hemophilia to take better decisions in order to limit damage as much as possible.  \n\nI was diagnosed when I was about five years old as a result of my parents wondering why I constantly had bruises on my legs from playing in the kids football team. Sometimes I even had to stay home from school just because I was not able to walk. Before blood tests showed that I had hemophilia, my parents had no idea what was wrong with me. At first they took me to a physiotherapist and there I got told that I had improper walking technique! (: \n\nNow I am 20 years old and I cannot say that that the quality of my life is compromised after reading some of you guys's situation. I am not in pain and I cannot remember the last time where I had a random bleeding out of nowhere. I do not inject factor VIII regularly because I feel that I do not need to. \n\nSometimes I even forget about my hemophilia for some time, although lately, I have been sad because I just realized that my right ankle has got poor mobility which I now realize is the reason that I have never in my adult life been able to do a squat with proper technique. And it is not just the mobility that is bad, I also feel like the joint is not moving the way it should. It is hard to describe what the problem is because I simply do not know. It could be that there is something wrong with my knee as well and that the ankle problem is connected to the knee in some way. I think it is from playing football. It fucking SUCKS but at the same time I know i am in a better position than most of you guys here since i am not in any pain and I can walk, run, jump - There is nothing I cannot do except from doing a squat which requires good ankle mobility. \n\nI am altough afraid of what will happen in 10 years or when I am old which is tough to think about...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there are any people with the same % of factor as me, I am curios of:\n\n\u2022 How is your situation? Do you take factor for preventive reasons and how often?\n\n\u2022 What stuff do you take and how often?\n\n\u2022 How much are you affected and how is your overall mobility? / How are your joints?  / How is hemophilia affecting your daily life?\n\nDo not want to be too long but I simply wanted to introduce myself and say hello.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also love to talk to someone (i saw that there was a discord) if anyone would be interested, to simply exchange experiences, knowledge, tips and so on. Welcome! I am 46 yrs old with severe A. I would be happy to talk. Message me anytime. Cool! Welcome, although I am not a Hemophiliac, glad to have you with us! Hey, Ludwig!\n\nMy name is Alfred, Moderate B 2%. I am also 20 years old and suffer from similar pain in my right ankle.\n\nYou are right! No need to be pessimistic about things that have happened to us. Actually we have to be thankful because it is still only a minor hindrance (or at least in my opinion).\n\nI need to take my prophylaxis - two times a week that is!\n\nI suffer from chronic pain in my right ankle that has made me unable to walk normally, in the sense that I am limp and my walking is by no means normal. However, I am still independent and with some good orthopedic shoes and a walking stick every now and then I am as fit as anybody else.\n\nTo be honest, now that I have heard of somebody that is exactly my age, I would love to talk over discord if that is okay with you. \n\nWhere I live there were some events for Hemophiliacs to meet and get to know each other, I attended all of them but I was always the oldest by 5-6 years or the youngest by the same amount. So I never had the chance to actually talk to somebody in the exact same stage in life.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you DM\u2019d me so we could exchange discord info!\n\nHave a great one! Welcome! One thing that is interesting is that fviii % does not always correlate with bleeds. Some with low levels do not bleed and some with higher bleed all the time.\n\nI have 13%, used to be 20%, but went down in menopause.\n\nI am on prophylaxis to prevent bleeds as I was getting too many... At least twice a month. Now on a long acting FVIII o have had three bleeds since August. Two were painful shoulder bleeds and the other an elbow.\n\nKeep yourself safe and healthy! Sending DM! Hi Ludvig welcome. Get on prophylaxis and begin walking everywhere instead of driving. Also tell your doctor that you are going to exercise daily so he can give you a dose that can cover it. Once the muscles are strong, you only need pain relieving cream for what seems to be ankle bleeds. Interesting, did not know about that.\n\nBut I assume those kind of things can change quickly when you get older, or do one who does'nt bleed much stay that way? Yes that sounds like sound advice. Already walking almost everywhere and standing up all day and have been for a while. Measured it and on average I am sitting for 1 1/2 hours a day maybe.  \n\nMakes a lot of sense to stay strong and keep getting stronger to relieve the joints from a lot of load.\n\nI think I will get on Prophylaxis, I mean it cannot hurt right? Or can it? Great question... I depends on the mutation that caused the hemophilia. With some mutations factor goes up and bleeds go down... In others factor goes down and bleeds up.", "Anyone else feel like they have been raised by helicopter parents because of their Hemophilia? Which maybe even lead to alot of psychological issues in later life, like depression, anxiety, prone to addictions, agoraphobia, or anything else you can think of? Possibly. I blamed my parents for a lot of things. In the end it was fruitless.  At first that is what I thought. But than I just did my own thing and realized they only do what they do because they love me. I am now married and own a semi successful business and am beyond blaming them. Do not forget the hell they went through raising a hemophiliac, I look back and wonder how my mom survived. I was such a little shit and I always was hurt or in trouble. Helicopter parents are always going to be able to justify their behavior, hemophilia or not. \n\nI remember my HTC staff and state org's workers always talked about leading as normal a life as possible during clinics or visits, so if a parent is listening they would know that helicoptering is not necessary. \n\nIf you are feeling those things you should talk to a professional about it, your state's hemophilia network can probably set you up with a social worker or therapist for free or reduced cost.  Yep, went through this with my mom during my shitty teenager phase. It took a while but I eventually got over it. Not with me. Maybe it is generational, but I was allowed to make my own decisions, but I was always reminded when I made the wrong decision when I was in pain/had a severe bleed due to injury. I heard a lot of \"Do not come crying to me when you get a bleed\".\n\nAt the time, I was not supposed to live past 16, so when I was younger both my parents and Doctors agreed the leash should not be so tight. So I did a lot of stupid things. I paid for it then and I am paying for it a lot more now. But, I would not want it any other way. My mom tried but I was not having it.  I did whatever my brothers and friends were doing and only infused when I really needed it badly.  My cousin was raised by a very strict mom who actually wrapped all of the corners in her house with towels to help prevent injuries and he was in a lot worse condition (as far as joint injuries go) than I was when he passed away from HIV (tainted factor) a few years ago.\n\nHowever, one thing you did not specifically mention is that  I get hurt a lot.  I do not mean severe bleeds, I mean unlucky injuries.  I have broken eleven bones and had twenty three stitches in just over forty years.  No one else in my family has ever broken a bone or had stitches.  I am horribly accident prone and always have been.  My cousin, who was also severe Hemophilia A, was the same.  Sometimes I feel like the fact that I was told from birth that I would be injured more than anyone else has contributed to this, but somehow it seems to even go beyond that.  I am very curious as to whether other hemophiliacs have the same experience when it come to \"bad luck\" injuries. During the HIV era, a lot of my patients' parents faced an ugly Hobson's choice, give my kid factor for his knee bleed and risk AIDS or do not give him factor and risk him being disabled.  We did a lot of Rasputin-channeling with ice and morphine.  We can see that those parents would reasonably be helicoptering due to lack of a desire to have to make that Hobsen's choice very often.\n\nThe first post-HIV era parents were lost in the desert.  These folks would go to the NHF meetings looking for some tips from older parents/patients and get nothing but grief and rage.  I did a lot of hand holding and giving parents basic tips like what kinds of carseats were useful.   These parents had a lot of stress that pushed them to helicopter behavior as the fund of knowledge for them was zero.  Instead of a bunch of kindergarten moms talking to Junior high moms, you had a generation of parents carving their own paths.\n\nThe second post-HIV era parents had these people to lean on, so they did not come to the HTCs with the same very basic questions, but they had financial hits as the recombinant products were now the primary factor types and insurance companies were still pushing back.  These parentsalso worried about their kids getting a bleed and having to get plasma factor in the ED, and they worried about non HTC staff knowing what to do with their kid.  Thus the push towards bubble wrapping you.\n\nThe current generation of parents is better.  We know that helicopter parents and binder moms are bad for boys.  We stress that to the moms and the kids.  I tell my parents that transition to independent adult status starts at age 4 in our HTC.  At that point, I expect my kids to help set up factor and at various age points, they learn to self infuse and so on.  In the teens, I expect them to track their supply and learn how to talk with insurance companies and pharmacies.  Hopefully, this generation will feel less rotor blade downblast.\n\nGive the moms a break.  Hobson's choices suck.  Getting a life-altering diagnosis days after giving birth is a big hit.  Doing either when you are effectively alone, makes you want to reach for the bubble wrap.  \n\nKnow that if you are in your 40's or in your 30's, yours and your parents' sacrifices have made it a lot easier for the weepy  new mom in the corner of the NHF meeting.  I was under 10 years old when the whole HIV scare was big. Luckily I never got HIV but I did get hep C. Thanks for your reply, I can really relate to what you described. There were some exceptions! My folks did their homework very quickly, I was on a restricted donor list and avoided HIV/HepC (born at end of '85).\n\nMy pediatric hematologist was also quite vocal in his objections to them taking me skiing... somehow I survived! Many of my pediatric patients had restricted donor lists and their families were at the front of the line for Monoclate P and then for Recombinate.  I always objected to my patient who was into parasailing.  He and the other kids who were into sports that would not normally be safe for hemophiliacs seemed to rather enjoy regaling me with stories of their past mis-deeds.\n\n", "Baxalta Wins Appeal of Hemlibra Drug Patent Infringement Suit  Who is more litigious: Takeda/Shire/Baxalta/Baxter, Novo Nordisk or Bayer?

Recently I have been having issues where small blood clotts have been blocking my syringes. I am very concerned by the clotts and was wondering if anyone had any advice? Blocking the tubing of the butterfly needle or blocking the syringe?  Maybe you are pushing it in too slow? You shouldnt be having blood clots in the syringe.  Are you pulling back on the syringe so the blood goes up to the syringe?  If so you should not do that.\n\nHow long are taking to infuse? With a constant pressure no blood should be flowing back into the needle, after the initial stab.\n\nWhat makes you think it is blood clots? I have noticed this a bit recently too.  I was injecting into a vein with a lot of scar tissue and thought it was related to that. To remedy, I simply drew the clot or whatever it was up into the syringe and it seemed to stay there while I continued injecting factor. I do pull back until blood is in the syringe to see if I am in a vein but should I not be going so far? Blocking the syringe I do try this but even if I push at an angle it just gets blocked again I see from your other comment the you pull blood all the way back into the syringe.  I would guess that that is what is causing the problem.\n\nWhat I do (I do not know if this is a recommended approach) is connect the butterfly to the syringe very loosely before inserting the needle into the vein.  Once the needle is in, I can see the blood return into the tubing and it pushes the air out of the tubing. Once the air is mostly out of the tubing and the blood is almost to the syringe tip, I tighten the butterfly connector onto the syringe an start pushing the plunger. Yeah thank you I will start doing that now or I will just push the factor to the end of the needle so there is no air in the tubing will that work? It may work.  I guess I worry that the pressure of the factor pushed into the tubing will not allow the blood to return to confirm a successful stick. Yeah do not pull blood into the syringe.  The blood can starting clotting in the tubing and syringe.  The tubing gets cleared once you start applying pressure but in the syringe the blood can form larger clots since it is kind of stagnant until it gets pushed into the tubing. \n\nOnce the blood is half way up the tube that should be more then enough to tell if it is the vein. I just push factor all the way thru the tube and let a drip drip out the needle. Then I infuse. I have done it this way for years with no problems. Do not pull blood all the way back. That is going to cause some problems. I find I get a blood return no problem even with factor to the needle. Try to change vein every time you inject I do try but I find it hard to access any other than in my elbow crease. Where else would you recommend? Try the one on your wrist for a change. I find it more difficult though. I run the factor down the needle to get rid of bubbles, then any draw back is minimal, or even using sodium chloride flush solution if you use it. Occasionally I have had to change veins mid infusion from losing access (VWD - no small volumes here!) but rarely since I have switched to filling the tube with the factor first. I do the same as you. No clots in the syringe. Knocks on wood.\n\nAnd my veins can be hard so sometimes the syringe will be blood red but bump so have to remove butterfly and try, rest try again.\n\nSomething else might be causing your issue. Veins I have found. Between thumb and finger. Between the 3rd and 4th finger. Between the 4th and little finger.\n\nBasically sit up straight and let your arms and hands hang down. Then after like 30s to a minute, tournequet it and you should see the veins pop up on your fists.\n\nIf you are rich, you can also buy a fancy light that shines on your skin and it shows your veins very clearly.

Are there any insurance companies which cover the cost for the same for the expats as well? If so, how much monthly premium are we looking at here? Moreover, would prophylaxis be a possible option included in the plan as well? At the moment I am taking 2000 IU twice a week.

So my Father created a no hit league so I could continue to play. Here is a video from Red Deer Pond Hockey's website. ", "My Hemophilia improved - drastically. Please help me find out why. So I was born with Hemophilia A, 3% severity, which means I had grown accustomed to certain things throughout my life which I am sure many of you are aware of. Small bruises turned into massive bruises, target joints such as my ankles, elbows, and especially hips bled regularly. I had to treat at home, spent weeks in the hospital at times, etc. I also developed a dependence to pain killers that turned into a serious heroin addiction. \n\nHowever about 3 years ago, when I got sober and stayed sober, I started changing my lifestyle drastically as far as diet and exercise goes - I included fruits and veggies into my life every day, cooked for myself most of the time (about 90-95% of meals), and exercised by lifting weights about 3-4 days a week. \n\nI went to my hematologist 2 years ago for my annual checkup and my factor levels were up to 11%. We thought it was a mistake so we took the tests again a few months later, this time my levels were at like 15%. We took the test again a few months later and they were still in the teens. \n\nMy bleeds are few and far between now, and never drastic. I have not needed more than 2 days to recover from a joint bleed in over 3 years. I just got what SHOULD have been a super big bruise on my leg and it is already started disappearing after 2 days. \n\nHas anybody else had these results happen to them? I would discount it to genetics but I have two brothers with Hemophilia - one has stayed the same (3% severity) and the other has developed inhibitors, and has thus become quite disabled. I know that this is not definitive proof that genetics plays the predominant role in my escalating factor levels, but it does hint that something environmental is correlated with this. \n\nMy doctor has no clue what is happening and encouraged me to contact outside resources to try and solve this puzzle. Does anyone know what is happening? And if not, can anyone direct me towards a medical community or doctor who may be able to explain what is going on? I have never heard of this and neither has my doctor but I am curious for more information. \n What is your age now?  What country are you in? I am 25 and I live in the US.  You mean Factor VIII (8), right? Yes, sorry. Too used to writing WWII for my school papers \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I would say the exercise was a big part - my hematologists have always told me about the benefits. Less strain on your muscles in everyday activities, fewer bleeds. It also teaches you the safe ways to use your muscles, if you were not aware. You do have to stick to less dangerous exercise with severe hemophilia to not get injured though, like swimming/weights with technique/static climbing or bouldering I would agree completely - the effects of proper exercise as well as diet and sleep can quite frankly turn your world around. What I am concerned about is if this is straight up changing a biological process of my body - in the sense that I am literally increasing more Factor VIII than I am supposed to according to a disease I have had my whole life - how is there not more information on this?  Or is there and I am just not finding it?  Have you and your brothers had any genetic testing done to determine which FVIII gene mutations are present? We have not. Are there any relevant differences between separate genes coding for Factor VIII?  Hi. Can you tell us more about your diet please ? Yeah sure. As prologue, I would like to point out that the most relevant change in my diet would be very high protein and fruit - I get those in no matter one. SOME days I miss my veggies, but not all. \n\nEvery morning the past two years I make a smoothie - oats, PB powder, straws berry, blue berry, banana, carrots, spinach / kale, and protein powder. \n\nFor lunch it is either meat and rice or a deli meat sandwich with a slice of cheese and lots of green. \n\nFor dinner honestly it is a toss up - but lots of the time its eggs or meat, and potatoes.  (And let us be honest I get down on some lean cuisines and like many of us, take-out occasionally) \n\nAnd all throughout this I eat RX bars / Lara fruit bars / protein bars, and eggs are always my backup meal. Like I said - biggest change has been lots of protein.  Interesting. But the most interesting for me is the fact that you were an heroin addict and you stopped. Congratulations. It has to have a relationship with it. Because hemophile that have a protein diet and exercise must not be rare. But heroin addict who stopped is. IANAD but I think there is only gene involved in FVIII.  But there are thousands of different mutations to the gene which in turn cause hemophilia A.  Identifying your mutation and those of your brothers would probably be a good starting point to solve the mystery you have described.  \n\nAre you currently a patient of an HTC?\n\nOn a side note, has your brother with inhibitors considered trying Hemlibra?\n\n  What is an HTC? I have a hematologist but honestly he is like 65-70 years old and is just mailing it in at this point. All he cares about is seeing if I have problems and factor on hand. He does not really have the time or wherewithal to delve into this. \nMy brother keeps his medical stuff pretty under wraps because he does not like talking about it - he is 27 and bedridden most days. I have read some prior research and have had the inclination to hold that conversation with him though.  Yeah and that seems to be around the time my Hemophilia began improving. Honestly I wish that it improved without me having to be a heroin addict - at least then there would not be SO many confounds in this equation, as diet and exercise were not the only things I changed. \n\nWhen I got sober I changed everything - daily habits, friends, lifestyle, sleep routine, work ethic, social life, spiritual life, emotional coping, etc. If an environmental change caused this improvement and I want to solve this mystery - we are fucked. I guess that is why I mentioned diet and exercise as I am hoping there is a biological explanation for this, though I guess the other things can trigger biological responses as well - in terms of neurotransmitters and hormone regulation.  ( Environmental are too common imo. It is the diet or the drug addiction/sober thing. I am afraid it is the later, cause it is something medecine will not study. Diet and environment must have been studied. Thanks for sharing.  Fascinating, I am 2% and find that regular hard exercise(lifting) and good diet reduce amount of bleeds; but I have never had factor levels increase that drastically, i have fluctuated between 2-5%.\n\nYou may have some unique genetic composition.  It might be worthwhile to reach out to a lab working with hemophilia genes or research.  \n\nI do not think the lifestyle changes are responsible for increased factor levels. I remember reading about a hemophiliac who had a weird genetic mutation and his factor levels rose later in life as well.   I am inclined to say you are just using less of your factor, although perhaps your diet changes allow your body to heal better in general also reducing factor needed i hypotheses that exercise causes \u2018controlled\u2019 inflammation and your body reacts to inflammation by flooding body with anti inflammatory chemicals/hormones and the abundance of anti inflammatory chemicals leads to a reduction in bleeding episodes.  This does not explain your increased factor levels, as I mentioned before it must be some weird/awesome genetic thing. I would find the nearest htc (hemophilia treatment center) to you and make appointment ASAP.  They often have research arms and very experienced docs that can help solve this mystery or point you in right direction.  Most major hospitals in bigger cities have well funded htcs.  All of the HTCs near me (Austin, Ft. Worth) are based in children\u2019s hospitals, and based on the answering machines it sounds like the HTC in Austin is definitely for children. I still called and left a message regardless. I am also contacting a few people in the academic world who have written credible articles on Hemophilia treatment / development. I will keep you guys updated!  Contact the HTC at UT Southwestern in Dallas. It is for adults. Are you female?  My factor levels also went up drastically (less than 1 to ~4) when I hit puberty.  They think it has something to do with female hormones Any updates? Maybe the heroin did a number on your liver and it began producing more Factor VIII?

I passed out from the pain when they did this to me. It was a nightmare. They literally had to strap my arm down to get it to the extension point. I have really bad anxiety about having to potentially get another one in the future. No tips from me, just a fellow commiserator.  ... Do not extend to the point of pain. When you are at your limit, that is your extension. End of story. Do not hurt yourself. Does your HTC have access to a bone radiologist?  We have a bone group due to the ortho practice and Rheum group.  They are remarkably better than our Ped radiologists for these special needs imaging problems.  I would call your HTC and have them do your scan with one of these groups who may be better able to image you in a position of comfort. Yeah I definitely relate, it was getting to that point and eventually they came to check on me because I was under the impression I could not move my upper body and was using my feet as a distraction to not pass out.   \nHave you found any alternative to having the work sorted? That is the difficult part, for them to get viable results the machine pretty much forces you into that position. I tried to work around it beforehand but we could not find anything, I was fine for a few minutes it was after like 5 it was becoming painful then unbearable. I will speak with my specialist and see what they can suggest, I am more than willing to try different methods it is just I would rather go back to that as a last resort in a way. Understood.  Have they ultrasounded the joint?  That may be a lot less painful if they have not already done that.

This is the 3rd time I have been denied Medicaid was just wondering what other options I might have. I live in Indiana and there is some decent resources but the more input the better. Are you being denied for a particular reason? I cannot remember the first reason but one was my IHTC telling FSSA I was not disabled and the other was because I made \"too much money\" It looks like the ( is $1454 per month.  So if you make more than that you would not be eligible. Yeah I saw that definitely make a little less than that a month but it is not too big of a deal I suppose I will figure it out cause I kind of have to Have you considered the marketplace for insurance?

I am going to call my HTC tomorrow, they mentioned a few things I could do I was denied in the market place too. I do not really know what the deal is but I figure I will call my HTC in the morning to see if they have any ideas Also each time I had been denied I made an appeal and each appeal was turned down too If you have whatever documentation they require and you meet the requirements on their own website, you should still appeal.  It is a different reason than the previous denials, so you should still try.\n\nAlso contact the constituent services person in your congressperson's local office and see if they can assist you.\n\nI will also send you information about Patient Services Inc.'s legal services group which may be of some help. See my previous comments about PSI (", "Miracle Of Hemophilia Drugs Comes At A Steep Price  Great article, I feel like they did a fairly objective job at covering an issue that affects all of us.  One thing that was hinted at, but not outright spelled out, is that unlimited patient choice in the US also contributes to cost.  It is easy to point to Europe as a solution...\n\n&gt;In Europe, hemophilia drugs cost less than half what they cost in the U.S. That is because payers \u2014 usually governments \u2014 request bids and pick products based on cost and quality.\n\n...but the article does not mention that the bid/tender system in use by many European countries severely limits choice.  The product with the lowest bid becomes the defacto product for that nation's hemophilia patients.  There is no choice of product and patients may have to switch products every few years, depending how the system is set up.\n\nMy point is simply that there is no easy solution.", "To treat one rare blood disorder, scientists exploit another ", "New here and am blown away. I was diagnosed as having VWD over 20 years ago and due to pre-existing conditions, I was not covered by any insurance for nearly 14 of those years.  My last bleeding time was done in 2002.  I did not clot after 25 minutes.   When I finally got coverage again through my state's local health plan, I was dismayed to find that they did not have my VWD on my medical file. It took years and finally an angry neurologist who was ordered to do a nerve conduction test to get it on my medical file.  That has been the extent of what has been done with my VWD. I have overlapping autoimmune disease including Sjogren's that ended up taking a toll on my teeth.  Several years ago, my dentist did two root canals, a filling and an extraction all at once that turned into a nightmare.  They ended up using hemistats and had me sit for hours in the hopes that I would stop bleeding so they could finish.  My dental care has been pretty much hinged on emergency situation to emergency situation since then.  Yesterday, I went in for another emergency situation (infection in lower and upper jaw) and the dentist refused to treat me on the basis of my health conditions and VWD.  I am being set up for oral surgery on both my upper and lower jaws soon.  I talked about this with my friends on facebook and one of them was shocked to find out that I had VWD but was not under the care of any hematologist nor was I under the care of my local hemophilia center.    \n\n\nI just called my local regional hemophilia center today and talked to them.  Apparently they have me on file but a referral was never sent to them.  The young woman sounded pretty upset at the fact that I have oral surgery upcoming and have not been set up with them at all. They gave me the fax number to give to my primary care doctor and told me to tell her to refer me asap so they can get everything that needs to be done done before the oral surgery takes place.  I called my doctor's office, gave them the name of the hemophilia center and the fax number. I just got a call back saying that my doctor has sent a referral to a local hematology and oncology clinic at a different fax number.  Not the hemophilia center.  I told the nurse that no, it needs to be the hemophilia center at this number as per the hemophilia center itself.  Not the hematology and oncology clinic.    \n\n\nI am so frustrated and dismayed at all of this that for the first time, I actually thought to see if there was a hemophilia subreddit.  Found you all and I am so upset.  I have spent the last 7 years being confronted with surprise from clinicians and dentists asking me if I am on warfarin because of how much I bleed.  I had to fight to even get the VWD diagnosis in my current medical file.  I have not had a hematologist since 2002 and I am blown away that there were even treatments for us.  Back in 2002, the bleeding time was done before a planned C-section and even though DDAVP was administered, I still hemorrhaged.  All my dental work has been hinged on how much I bled, what is my iron count, can I afford another bleed for years.  Now I find out that this may have been utterly unnecessary simply because my doctor did not bother to refer me to a hematologist or the hemophilia center.    \n\n\nThe best part of all of this?  Things are being scrambled to be fixed now that I have oral surgery coming up but I have been on watch for emergency neurosurgery for two years now in the event I lose function of my legs, bladder and bowel due to spinal cord compression. Without a hematologist.  Without the hemophilia center.  I am devastated and angry. Ok 2 things...\nFirst I recommend talking to a lawyer to see if you have a malpractice case because those doctors did not seem to actually care about your health besides the dentist refusing... untreated bleeding disorders are a major threat to one\u2019s health and should be treated as such. On a more positive note hemophilia centers are not just local there are foundations for the Great Lakes and a national foundation who are and always will be happy to help. They even have an annual conference where you can go and learn more about the medicines, the different conditions, and even can seek help for stuff that you outlined above! You can also contact them pretty easily (Facebook or through their website), they are called the NHF (National Hemophilia Foundation) and I am pretty sure they can help! But whatever happens I hope things get easier for you. Your experience sounds awful. I wish it were not so common. I am glad you refused to have your care referred to a hem/onc clinic and insisted on the HTC - that can be tough to do but you absolutely made the right call. Thank you.  I am so pleased with my local Hemophilia Center.  After hearing nothing back from my doctor, I gave them a call at 10 minutes before everyone closed.  The woman I spoke with that time was already aware of my situation, which blew me away, and after telling her what occurred with the wrong referral, she said \"Let me call your doc, I will call you right back\".  5 minutes later, she called back and said \"the referral is done\" and gave me the name of my new hematologist. Just like that, she had it done. Thank you. I have considered what I should do about my primary care for some time. When my oral surgery is all squared away, going to have to do some serious thinking.  I do not think she has any clue how scary it is been fearing any emergency surgery or severe car accident and wondering if they will even note that I have VWD.  That was not okay and should not have happened.  It is not just me either. My son was tested and dx'd with VWD and poss hemophilia type A when he was about a year old.  I am already incredibly impressed with the hemophilia center. They made my doctor snap to in just 5 minutes so that was fantastic.  I am so glad that my friend told me about them and I am so glad that I found this forum.  My son and I are going to be getting the better testing done (it was ages ago when we were initially tested and they know so much more now, it is wild!) so this subreddit will be fantastic to get an idea of so many things so we can catch up.  \n\nThank you!

", "FDA Panel Endorses Gene Therapy For A Form Of Childhood Blindness ", "Hi, I have a strong Hemophilia A and I just passed my first Kung Fu exam! Here is my story. Hi!\n\nI am just so proud about my accomplishement, that I have to share it with someone. My parents have always been very cautious that I would not hurt myself. They had lost my older sister at birth, so they were of course happy about me being well but they feared a lot that I might get a serious injury. You could say they raised me in fear - I was not allowed to participate in many sports activities when I was young and I was left out a lot. They forbid me to go ice-skating with the other kids, play football in a club or join a basketball course at school. I was stuck with swimming and running or cycling, which got boring really quick for me. II wanted to do something special. Later on, their fear extended on a lot of other things, like taking the bus when it was snowing, when everyone else from my then dance class was going to a disco...stuff like that. I never had a problem with spontaneous bleeding so I could not quite understand this. I was so angry at times, feeling completely helpless, when my parents took something away from me that I really started to like, so my head reacted with depression and damaged my self-confidence a lot. I started to mistrust my skills and gave up on new things really quick, because the thought, that I could not be good at something I liked or wanted to do made me give up on what I was doing and I just threw it away. This was kind of my way to punish myself. My parents did not talk so much about feelings with me and my brother, so I could not handle what was going on with me. I did not have any older person to talk to about this, I just never learned how to, so I stuck to myself.\n\n\nThen, my uncle, who suffered from an HIV infection through poluted medication died. He was almost the only person I would look up to at that time. I wanted to be like him, make him proud, get his attention. He too suffered from the fear of his parents. He was a \"mothers son\" in some way, which I did not want to become at all. It somehow hurt my feelings a lot and I grew to become colder still.\n\n\nThen, a few years later, after I started an apprenticeship, my father died and this changed almost everything in my life. My then girlfriend made me see a therapist and this is where everything got better, slowly, but it did. At this point, 7 of the people I had really liked a lot and looked up to had died. My family had fallen to pieces and I was almost on my own. The silly fact that I would been to more funerals than I would had loved girls scared me and drove me on to change my life and live more and more each day.\n\n\nI finished my apprenticeship and started studying on a university for applied science. I took Tai Chi classes, to see if my body joints could take the movements. My knees started to hurt because they were not used to sport. I went to see my doctors now and then to check if I hurt myself irreversibly, but in the end it turned out to be unstretched tendons, that were somehow causing small bleedings in or around my knees. I mustered my strength and said to myself, that this would be what I pay with this time, instead of throwing it away again. And my whole body finally got stronger, healed up and got so much more flexible as I just went on to train Tai Chi 3~4 times a week.\n\n\nThen I got excited to find out there is a KungFu school in my town and I tried it out to let off some steam I accumulated over the years and to clear my mind after a long day of studying. And my tendons started acting up again. My master, who is currently becoming a doctor for physical therapies of some sort helped me out a lot and stretched me very hard sometimes - my knees and also my feet got better. The other students there had been very cautious with me at the beginning. After half a year I felt confident enough with my body to stop Tai Chi classes and go all out on KungFu, so I started sparring with the others. I have never felt better. We usually wear only boxing gloves as protection and you are looking out for each other. The Training is like Kickboxing and can be very exhausting when we train to fight against multiple opponents, but it is so rewarding! Lately, I have started Iron Body Training, which would normaly be unthinkable for a bleeder - it is hitting your body with sticks to harden the bones and strengthen the muscles against attacks. A few bruises on my shins later, I started to love it and it makes me feel less feeble and more confident. Last wednesday, I passed my first exam. I sped past 6 other students, of whom the oldest was training for nearly 3 years now what I did in one. I fell in love with my best friend and she and her daughter are now my new family.

I can see that it was banned in the US for containing coumarin, which is blood thinning. Wondering if 1-2 drinks would be any cause for concern.  For reference I am severe hemophilia A.  Alcohol already reduces the amount of platelets you create. I finally learned that if I was going hardcore partying, that I would might as well treat before hand.

It is not like they distilled pure coumarin and it is ONLY the blood thinning \"chemicals\" in it, they probably just added some for flavoring.\n\nIt could not be any worse than popping an ibuprofen.

I always joke that it is the only good genetics I got from my mom's side of the family (both she and my grandfather never got hangovers).\n\nAs for treating, I am as severe as you can get (no traceable amount of clotting factor) and I get A LOT of \"spontaneous\" bleeds (bleeds that pop up out of nowhere that are not caused by a known injury), and I noticed the day after i would get pretty wild I would end up with a bleed of some kind. Maybe because I am stumblin and bumblin, maybe because of the alcohol \"thinning blood\".....probably some of both. So it got to the point that I would just treat before I knew I was going to get completely funked up. And lo and behold, the next day bleeds went away.\n\nI do not know how to help with your hangovers other than drink lots of water and stay away from drinks with tannins (wine, whiskey and beer).

I have hemophilia A. This was right after Ryan White was kicked out of school for being HIV positive. The nurse freaked out and called a meeting of all of the school staff, and they chose to write a letter to all the parents saying that I had hemophilia and I might have HIV. So my mom pulled me out of school. Fuck those people. Worst time to get a nose bleed. When I was about 11 years old we went to Knotts Berry Farm and had just gotten onto \"The Corkscrew\" roller coaster.  I felt it coming on, but I hoped it was just a runny nose.

So it bled again got an MRI no infection. But i just got 2000 units of factor and i have not found any impact from when ive gotten it at 2:00 now it is 5:30. Will I feel it tomorrow morning? When do are you supposed to feel factor kick in? Or is it different for everyone ? I am hemophilia A moderate. Thanks. I think the answer to your question is you will not \u201cfeel it\u201d. Taking factor should allow your body to stop the bleeding, after which it will take days to reduce the swelling and heal. I think it will be different for everyone, but for me a bleed like the one you described would take me weeks to fully recover. You will not sorta say \u201cfeel it\u201d. Adding onto what ChampMcBoomstick said, factor allows your body to clot. You said you took 2000 units so you are right around my dosage level &amp; they gave it multiple times throughout the week because of prophylaxis so that is okay. When you have a bleed and give factor, give it 8 hours and you will start to feel better. Not fully for obvious reasons but swelling will start to go down which means less internal bleeding is occurring. It may take you more than one or two days for the swelling to go down. Everyone is body heals at different paces. If you are not a person who supplements his/her body with vitamins and protein and such, then I suggest fixing your diet as well to keep inflammation low even when you get injured. Another thing I would like to say is that the less Sodium you intake, the better. High amounts of Sodium causes inflammation to form quicker than usual. Factor + rest(minimum: 6 hrs if you can, ideally: 7-8 hrs)+ ice(10mins on and off) + water intake(minimum: 60oz or 3 Poland Springs, ideally: 80-100oz or 5-6 Poland Springs) is the key formula every Hemophiliac should follow. When you have a bleed, that means there is a tear in your tissue. So since hemophiliacs lack factor, the bleed continues, until the factor is provided. Then the clot is able to form. So when you have been bleeding for a while (internally usually), and your blood suddenly starts to clot (due to factor) there is a lot of blood there that needs to clot. So you are going to have sort of a big scab under your skin somewhere, where the bleed/clot is. Even if the bleed did not swell much, there is still going to be a soft mushy scab of sorts under there. So every time your factor wears off, after a day or two, all it takes is a small amount of movement or trauma for that scab or blob of clotted blood to aggravate the initial tear in your tissue, and cause it to re- bleed. It supposedly takes 6 to 8 weeks for a hematoma to fully absorb back into your body. This is why you either need to catch the bleed right away, so there is not time for a large clot or internal scab to form (I do not know the technical term for this besides hematoma but that does not quite fit). Or, if you were not able to catch it soon enough, and there is a lot of blood and scabbing around the injury, you will need to infuse more heavily , and be more careful, so the bleed does not start again, and if it does there is factor in you to stop it. And depending on how bad the bleed was, and how quickly you got it stopped, and how many times your factor wore off and it re-bled, or \u201ctrickle bled\u201d , it can vary drastically in the time it takes for a bleed to resolve. So the rule I follow is treat heavily, if possible. As long as you are not taking so much that you over clot (which actually takes a lot of factor 8 for hemophilia A) , the more you are covered the quicker you will heal with the least likelihood of re-bleeding. I do not see why we are not just treated adequately? But do not get me started. I have been made to feel guilty my whole life by insurance companies and state agencies trying to tell me that my health care costs are robbing the system. What a fucking joke. Also, this is just my interpretation of thousands of bleeds over 46 years. I think it is pretty accurate, although I have never met a doctor with similar insights. Because they probably have not had thousands of bleeds, so how could they know? They do tend to agree with me when I explain that this is how I believe it works. But I am never sure if they really get it or they just want to get me out the door. After all by this point in the rant I am clearly insane. Taking factor should get you closer to a normal person's recovery time. I would suggest avoiding aggravating your elbow in any way since it seems to be recurring.\n\nImmobilize with a sling or something, lay down so it is above your heart, and do periodic icing to help out. Join bleeds can be particularly idiosyncratic. And certainly in my experience the most innocuous bleeds can take a longer time to heal. Certainly with joints such as elbows, hips, knees etc. Although you do not \u2018feel it\u2019 as you say I usually know when a clot has formed. For me, I sometimes actually loose mobility and function after the clot has formed in the joint, occasionally with an increase in pain, not for too long, due to the increase in the \u2018thickness\u2019 of the clot within the joint. Soft tissue swelling decreasing and a reduction in heat is the first sign that treatment is successful. But as I say it is very subjective and most Haemophiliacs become experts in how their body feels. The rules for me are treat quickly, treat longer for joints, and I also take tranexamic acid to maintain good clotting and Etoricoxib for pain. Although always talk to your Doctor. The more bleeds you have over your life the more intuitive you get about treatment and how long things will take to heal and how effective treatment will be. I have had injuries that I have instantly thought  \u2018oh no I am in real trouble here\u2019 but it turned out to be fine. And I have had bleeds that I have thought \u2018 this is not a big issue\u2019 and it is turned out to be quite bad. So the rule of thumb is always treat for longer if you think you might need it. I often treat an extra couple of days for joint bleeds because it is annoying when they come back after under-treating as it were. It can be worrying when re-bleeding occurs but it is relatively common. Be patient. Take good care of yourself. As I have got older I have also noticed that stress and anxiety over prolonged bleeding episodes actually effects my healing. Try some relaxation techniques and if you have an opportunity ask to speak to a specialist Heamophilia physiotherapist. Good luck How many percent coverage does it take to over clot? 2000iu in you raises your factor level to how many percent? You have to calculate it according to your body weight. I am not sure exactly. There are other things besides factor levels that can lead to a heart attack or stroke. But I know it is not very common to over clot from over infusing. You could raise your level to 150% safely. Probably higher. As long as you do not always have that high of a level you are not likely to over clot.", "I am so grateful for my insurance  You can say that again.

Yea there was this body builder that had severe A and he claimed he pretty much cured his hemophilia, in the sense that he did not bleed anymore, by working out and getting in super good shape. He died of something unrelated, which is really too bad because he probably had some really good ideas about how to get in shape with hemophilia. I can say for myself tho that I was deficient in testosterone and would get tons of muscle bleeds, and when I went on testosterone replacement my muscles got back in shape and I do not have them anymore (muscle bleeds I mean, still have muscles). It was a night and day difference. Old hemophiliacs especially ones who have used pain meds should get their testosterone levels checked imo because I bet it is a pretty common thing and having the right T levels helps so much. I have ALWAYS felt better and healthier when I was in the gym, am currently trying to get my test levels looked at Yea I usually just swim and bike. But now I am going on hikes and riding my dirt bike on hard trails, stuff that would have killed me before. And I am 45, severe A, and I went through all that bullshit in the 80\u2019s with tainted factor and was hit hard and came out ok. Not bragging (kind of bragging), just amazed at how with patience and hard work your body is capable of a lot. I am really lucky too. I am finally switching from a Peds clinic to adult, but while my clinicians in peds said to to weights and everything else my Hematologist was a proponent for building muscle. He would not recommend hitting a 500lb squat PR, but certainly professed the benefits that strong muscles gave to your joints Yes! It can help a ton! Muscle can protect the joints and prevent injury. My hematologist is always dogging on me to lift weight and get more muscle mass. My HTC has a physical therapist that can help people make work out plans that are safe.

I am trying to get tested tomorrow, but i am wondering if there are any concerns about having covid-19 and having hemophilia A. Thanks. Having hemophilia will not make it any worse. If anything it supposedly might not be as bad because you are not as likely to over clot. Not as far as I know - but the WFH has published loads on their website about Covid. Probably just let your haematologist know if test is positive. \n\nAnd get vaccinated as soon as you can after recovery! I tested positive last week and have severe A.

I am a 19 y/o female with type 1 VWD and have been really struggling with finding a birth control that helps with my bleeding. Are there any birth control pills that have worked really well for anyone or other contraceptives that have helped? I try to stay on a 3 month cycle but have been experiencing lots of breakthrough bleeding recently (but have not changed how I take my meds) so my doctor switched me to a new pill and I have now been bleeding for over a month straight. I am curious about IUDs but hesitant to try one. I have spent the last few years with the same exact problem!\nI have tried Microgestin a few different times (15 and 30 mg). It would work for a few months then I would have the same issues with breakthrough. For a while I did 3 weeks of microgestin then stop and use Tranexamic Acid for 4-5 days. That was not my favorite because personally, it is better to not bleed at all than to begin bleeding and try to control it after. But I have heard others have success with it.\nI also tried the mini pill (progestin only) for a while. I have used that both continually and cyclically with the Tranexamic Acid. No great luck.\nI have had the Mirena IUD as well. My first one expelled, then the second was removed due to pelvic pain. But from what I know, that is SUPER rare so do not let that scare you. I just had another Mirena placed last week and so far so good. \nMy IUD troubles were so so weird and rare, but other than those problems, I loved it. It controlled my bleeding better than anything else. I would happily have some extra cramping to have significantly less bleeding, that is why I had another one placed last week.\nI suggest trying the IUD! It helped me a ton! I am currently on tranexamic acid and take it during my menstrual cycles and I cannot really tell a difference when I take it vs. when I do not. I was originally put on Stimate which I absolutely hate. The side effects are ass. I might look into an IUD but I already have some pretty significant cramping with my menstrual cycle.  Thank u for your advice !! Ya TX did not do much for me either. And finally someone else who hates Stimate!! I did a first trial of it in my hemophilia center, and my chest tightened and I felt like I could not breathe. Never again!\nI will say about the IUD - even with the slight extra cramping, it did not seem to make actual menstrual cramping much worse, it was more like a slight dull cramping at random times unrelated to bleeding. thank god i honestly feel like i am the only one who does not react well with stimate. i voiced my concerns with my doctors and they acted like i was crazy. I have a heart condition where I experience random episodes of heart palpitations when i do not drink enough water and obviously you cannot drink water on stimate so u can guess how that goes. I was interested in switching to factor and self infusing but my factor 8 levels are not low enough. Have you considered infusing with factor during your cycle? i have pushed for that a lot but my doctors want to explore all other options first Push back and if they still hesitate, then hopefully you can find a htc or hematologist that will I take microgestin.

When I was growing up, I had limited range of motion in my elbow, but pain did not bother me too much so I pretty much did what I wanted. Played lots of sports, lifted weights, whatever.

It was a huge blow and really depressed me, it was the main source of enjoyment in my life.\n\nAfter I lost sports I started playing DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) as a way to stay in shape, have fun with friends and keep a competitive aspect of me alive.

I cant speak on behalf of you cause your almost double my age but i can understand what your going through. My brother had a terrrible terrible knee injury around 11 years old and hes 25 rn. He hasent been able to properly workout ever sense but there are way to make this less of a shoty situation. I have shoulder injury from wresting last year and i never got to fixing it. Im now doing physical therapy and have been for almost 2 months and my shoulderpain has been reduced by atleast 60% so its enough to wreste again. Ide say try out ph cause it can change your life and also of that doesnt work just find a passion that isnt physical. I love video games and hanging out with family in cookouts. I obiously cant fully understand your situation cause im not old enough but just be dam gratefull that you had those super intense young years of physical prowess if you cant fix the issue you have. Also i heard theres genetic therapy coming for hemophilia so that sounds kind of cool 47, Severe A. Look into subtle massage. Yoga , stretching. Swim regularly. See a good hemophilia trained PT if possible. Go slow and steady, do not overdue it. These things can improve, I am living proof. I am in better shape at 47 than I was at 18, I swear. It has taken a lot of patience and perseverance but I have learned that anything is possible. I infused as heavily as possible for a lot of years too. Now I am on Hemlibra, and I still infuse a few times a month because I am still improving my physical health. Attitude is important too. Positive self talk, meditation, all that is super helpful. It is not easy at all but the payoff is so worth it. Never give up.\nIf you want to talk about some ways to go about this stuff message me. &gt; waiting for that cure that is been promised to me has been 5 years away for 20 years now.\n\nIt is really too late for a cure to do much good for us \"older\" guys.  I would love to see a cure for the sake of the kids out there suffering but I would be a hell of a lot more excited about a breakthrough in ankle and/or elbow replacements for myself. Yeah, it is incredibly disappointing but at least for me a cure would give me options for more aggressive treatment on all my degenerated joints. Right now my options are close to 0 with no factor and any physical therapy just causing more bleeds.\n\nI had my back worked on by a PT working within an HTC before the pandemic and I let them know this was almost certainly going to cause a bleed but he was sure he could help and I wanted to believe. 2 bleeds and 2 \"shocked pikachu faces\" later I gave up. Thanks so much for your reply, it means a lot. I have had trouble finding other meaningful hobbies, and honestly I think part of that is the depression piece. I would love to talk sometime if you are up for it. Also down for some gaming as well! I do have some fire in me, but I do not always acknowledge it. Thanks for that. I feel pretty good about my treatment now actually. I am on a higher than average dose of eloctate but it has been working quite well for me. Took me awhile to dial it in but I have not had a breakthrough bleed in 6 months, and I had been having quite a few over the previous year. Man my elbow is a hot mess as well, definitely relate to you there. I used to be a swimmer, but honestly I think it would irritate it too much these days. I know I need to get back out there and try to do my best to take care of my body, it is just tough sometimes. I do feel like I have let the sense of loss overwhelm me, and it is something I am trying to actively work through. And you are right, all of us have overcame some pretty gnarly circumstances, and we should feel proud and inspired because of that!\n\nDo you take Celebrex every day by the way? I have a script for it, and have taken 2-4 week courses of it at times, but have tried to avoid being on it chronically. Maybe it is time I just commit to always taking it... I was a pretty gifted athlete as well, and both my parents were college athletes. It was tough not being able to achieve what I thought I was going to be able to. It definitely helps hearing from you guys and knowing that I am not alone. It is one of the reasons I'v been meaning to get more involved in the community where I live. Definitely up for some gaming and shit shooting haha. Also love the comment about the cure, story of our lives right there. Oh man this. I am not exactly optimistic, but I hope to god they come out with better regenerative therapies and/or better artificial joint replacements before my body is too far gone. Thanks for your reply man. I am glad that you are able to wrestle, that is awesome. I get down on remembering what I used to be able to do, but you are right, I should look at my old athletic days as a fond memory, and not something that I am sad is gone. Queue mental highlight real of all my best dunks lol. Fuck ya dude. What im planning in my physical life later in life is to workout only a bit and look back at all the cool shit i was doing and chillax. Almost as a retirment of sorts lol Swimming is something I am going to try to get back into. I was a pretty good swimmer back in the day but I am not sure my elbow will be able to handle it. I might possibly consider surgery though if they thought I would be able to swim regularly with reduced pain though. The problem I have there is my only option is basically a salvage operation, a last resort before having an elbow replacement so it is pretty risky. But I know it has worked well for some people.   \n\n\nI need to get back into PT as well. It is just tough, as I am sure you know. I have been to so many doctors, been in so much PT, you just get sick of it sometimes. Would love to connect sometime also, thanks for offering! Ha I love it! Yea, anytime. I used to swim competitively when I was younger but I gave it up.  I was never able to keep up as I would get a bleed then have to stop to let it recover.  In fact the arthritis in my hip was from a bad hip bleed I got after a swimming training camp when I was 12.\n\nMy elbow is the joint that probably worries me the most.  Replacements suck for elbows, basically cannot lift anything over 2 lbs and might not even be feasible for me.  Other option is fusion which has a host of other issues.\n\nIt is ok to feel bad.  Just like our joints sometimes we need to take a mental rest before we start the road to recovery.  But at some point you have to start the recovery.  When I decided to quit swimming, I did some coaching for a bit with young kids.  Like one of the other posters mentioned, helping others is a great to feel better.\n\nGive yourself permission to a bit selfish (it really is not btw) and take the time to find things that give you joy. Also do not be afraid to speak up to your doctors about your pain, there might be some surgical or pharma logical options to help.  It will not fix your joints but may give you enough relief that you can start some activities. 2 lbs is 0.91 kg Hey you might actually have another option for your elbow btw. It is called an inter-positional arthroplasty, where they basically reshape the joint and use a tendon graft as cartilage. It is a salvage operation and has risks, but way better than a fusion or replacement. That is my next option most likely. I have seen two preeminent elbow surgeons, Bob Hotchkiss at HSS in NYC and April Armstrong and pen state Hershey who I would recommend if you are looking for surgical options Thanks, I ask next time I see my Ortho.  Although I suspect my elbow is too far gone.  There really is not a joint left.  I have had the radial head removed 20 years ago.  The humerous has slid down the ulna which now sticks out an extra inch or so in my elbow.  There really is not a joint space left.  Although hurts less now than it used to and I still do daily weights with it.  Started at 1lb and up to 12lbs now. Wait a minute, inhibitors were tolerized? Inhibitors can be cured? I was under the impression that they could not be cured. Can you further elaborate on how you and your docs managed to do this?  Yeah you can have intense factor therapy to basically beat back your immune system. But it involved lots of infusions (and potentially expensive). \n\n I am 52 with severe B, my family did not get access to factor until I was 11, I have done well in spite of all the bleeds I have had. I am grateful that never got an inhibitor or HIV, I did beat Hep C after several tries. My right elbow is a problem and I have had 3 surgeries on it. But used to workout and weight lift in my 20s and 30s. I used to swim, run, hike, mountain bike. I am glad I did, I pushed past what many thought I could do. I did get hurt sometimes but so did my clotting friends. I think I am in pretty good shape for my age. I still walk and work in the yard and on my cars. I just have to rest a little longer these days and it is OK because I am glad I got to do the things I did. Just remember,  \"Do not be sad it is over, be happy because it happened\" I just found this page today. I am 35, Mild A, no inhibitor. I have had more bleeds in my ankles than i care to talk about lol. I recently had X-rays on both ankles, my right ankle (Always my target joint) is completely shot. Zero Cartlidge left in the joint, and the left ankle is almost there too. the Right ankle is pretty much naturally fused, it has almost zero movement in the joint whatsoever. I am pretty much in constant pain in my lower extremities from the bleeding i have had through the years.I was always very cautious as a child, (VERY sheltered by my parents and extended family), which thankfully, besides the ankles, i am ok for the most part. I was NEVER permitted to do any contact sports, and thank God, because i would probably be a lot worse than what i was.\n\nAll I had through my younger years was marching band, which after years of that, I injured my right ankle BADLY my Freshman year in the University band. And i was not able to do it anymore. That was a tough, tough blow to me, as my music and marching band was pretty much my main thing I ever did. But, after being upset about it a while, i eventually was able to move on, and change gears and was thankful that i was still able to do things I enjoy, like walking, mowing grass, fitness, etc.I am currently working on weight management, and working to get my weight down, as i have always been heavy, which probably attributed to my joint degradation. But, it is a two edged sword, because if you work too hard on exercise, you bleed, if you do not do enough, you bleed. So. just my two cents!  Message me if you ever need to talk.  \n\\*\\*Also: my fun activities consist of: Gaming, both PC and Retro. Gardening, Repairing Small engines, etc. I am 45 years old, severe Hemophilia A, clumsy English, LOL. I can absolutely relate in a way. Struggled with depressions from my teenage years until early 30s, my left ankle joint is in real bad shape, both of my elbows, well, could be worse... I had hep C since my childhood but got rid of it 3 years ago.\n\nFor me a game changer was to discover the Feldenkrais method after trying out a lot - yoga, pilates, tai chi, qi gong... The method is very gentle, takes in account your personal possibilities and limitations, it is more about awareness how you move than reaching a specific goal. Since 4 years I am a practitioner myself, working with other people and I feel (and get the feedback very often from my clients) that my own experience is reflected in how I work with them, being careful and accepting in limitations and worries one can have (physical and emotional).\n\nBesides this - it really helped me to connect with some people with other disabilities or chronic diseases. To have others that also have the experience of not being able to do things that a lot of people take for granted is very healing I think. healing in the sense of connecting with yourself I mean. And sometimes making fun with them of \"healthy\" people is also good :)\n\nI only started going to a fitness center 1 1/2 years ago (never did a lot of sport since school). To my surprise the senior instructor knew about hemophilia and gave me very good advice, especially in the sense of - take it easy, be careful with yourself, do not compete with yourself and certainly not with the others around you in the studio. So this would be another advice if you would like to try again some sports/movement practice - take your time to find the right one for you with an experienced and empathetic teacher/instructor! Be very open about your needs (and limitations). And, maybe the most important thing - do something that you enjoy, not something you think would/should be good for you.\n\nI still have bad days, of course, where I am sad, having pain or where I wish for being not like this. I liked what you wrote about radical acceptance. I think something like this can be very hard but at the end, yes, it is the right way. With all what is part of how/who you are. I do not mean this in an esoteric way but just - you are some guy, you need things and you have things to give :)  And being pissed is also totally ok.\n\nI wish you all the best, it will only get better, trust me :) Moving in water brings so much joy to me.

Hello all, hopefully this post does not break any rules. I have type 3 vonwillebrands and type A hemophilia(factor 8 deficiency) \n\nI have severe spontaneous bleeding episodes internally and externally, in addition to the fun time monthly thing. \n\nOver the last few years I have been tinkering with the idea of buying ADA or using ADA benefits at crowded concert venues. The private seating area would benefit me because unfortunately I have taken hits to the head and face while standing or moving through a crowd (4\u201911 very smol human) and that is in addition to the possibility of a spontaneous bleed while in the crowd. (This has happened,it was incredibly embarrassing trying to move through a crowd while bleeding profusely from my face not to mention unsanitary to others etc)\n\nHas anyone used these types of benefits before? I have used ADA benefits for other issues but IMO based on what you are saying i think you would qualify I have, mostly at smaller venues.  I give them a call prior to the show or tell the ticket-taker that I need ADA seating.   They are always helpful and do not ask any questions. That is what I am thinking. But some venues say for wheelchair/walker/canes or folks who cannot stand for long periods of time. But the ADA protects people with disabilities so I feel like they have to allow me in the area if I chose to purchase that option? Obviously it would be a second resort if it was really crowded etc but I also have PCS so it is absolutely crucial I protect my head to prevent further injury or bleeding. \n\nBottom line I feel like a dick seeking these options but I really feel as though I need them even though my disability is invisible They cannot tell you whether or not you are allowed in there. It is at the persons discretion whether or not they have a disability I have. I have bad arthritis in my knees and ankles. I used it at the house of blues. It was a great benefit, and I would totally do it again. Do not ever feel bad for using something or a benefit that was made for you. \n\nAnd for anyone who judges or gives you a hard time because you have an \u201cinvisible\u201d disability, I say fuckem and do not worry about it.

We infuse my son in the evenings because it fits our schedule better with the hectic mornings and trying to get the kids out the door for school.

Ty for telling me your experience Before the strenuous activity. Remember that factor has a half life so the earlier you jab the less is left in your body. Ty bro I have wrestling practice every weekday. Should i get it on every weekday? Before practice Yes. Check with your haemato doctor. They have a formula to calculate these things. Then follow that dosage for a while and see if it works. If you still have bleeds, then you may need to raise or lower the amount as the formula is for the average person, and just like free size t-shirts, they never really fit anyone well.

Hi everyone, small intro, I have borderline moderate/severe (1%) Hemophila A with no inhibitor, currently taking about 5000 units of Eloctate every 3-5 days, and having to get a vein every time is very hit or miss for me. So I read on here everybody's great stories about Hemlibra and thought \"oh wow, a sub q shot that works worlds better than even Eloctate? Sign me up!\". Sadly, my doc never heard of it until I brought it up in my appointment a couple months ago. He seemed skeptical of it, but said he would look into it.\n\nSince then I have had to visit the hospital several times due to said hit or miss nature of getting a vein (very frustrating). Doc's a busy guy, I get it, so I ask the nurse who is helping me and she said she would talk with him and give me a call. That was over a week ago, never got a call. I am thinking of scheduling another appointment to talk with him about it, but I work a 9-5 job and they have been more than generous with my situation, I do not want to take advantage of it for things that are not emergencies, but the more I mess up treating myself, the more desperately I want this.\n\nThere is like a billion questions running around in my head about this product, biggest among them is how to get it without breaking the bank. I got Blue Care Network insurance, and there is some company that is taking care of my co-pays for the Eloctate currently, which is a godsend (I cannot remember the name for the life of me though). It looks like Hemlibra has a similar sort of program listed on their website, but I do not know the logistics of switching those (especially since I cannot find the contact info for my current co-pay helper company).\n\nSorry for the ramble, just coming off another failure to treat myself and getting more desperate for the relief Hemlibra could bring me. Basically my question is \"what is the best way to get the ball rolling on getting Hemlibra when my doctor did not know about it and seemed skeptical?\" As well as wondering if anyone was in a similar situation, switching from Eloctate with some company paying the co-pays, and how that all works financially. The doctor sounds pretty incompetent - do you have any other options for HTCs in your area? In the US:  \nSearch for hemophilia treatment centers\nThen enter your address and search for the nearest one.  Get an appointment there.\n\nSeriously all serious diseases deserve expertise.  Not all hematologists are coagulation experts. The doc I go to is not in an HTC actually. Even the closest HTCs are quite a drive for me, but in this case I would be willing to go the distance for a second opinion. Honestly you should be going to an HTC regardless of whether you want to switch to hemlibra or not. The additional medical knowledge, as well as physical therapists to monitor joint health, are invaluable. But yeah, your local HTC will absolutely know about hemlibra and help you decide whether a switch is appropriate. It is billed differently by insurance. Factor is billed under major medical, and Hemlibra is billed as a prescription drug. So you should ask your insurance company about if they will cover it.  Send them to the Health Care Professionals part of the website? Ah, this is good to know, thank you.

Nope, it is equally devastating for everyone. Plenty of us have partied and lived to tell the tale.  In my experience, it is the things done in that \"I do not give a damn\" altered state of mind that is been more damaging than recreational drug use.  Play safe.  Or, as safe as you can.

Those affected by hemophilia are at greater risk of excess bleeds, inflammation and permanent damage to the soft tissues. It is therefore strongly not recommended for anyone.

I have finally stopped with the sugary drinks (about 90% of the time), now I am trying to lessen my desserts.\n\nPersonally, I cannot drink alcohol anymore because the pain in my joints is almost immediate. I wake up with swollen hands too. There is definitely a link between sugar and inflammation/ pain.\n\nI love sugar and sometimes have to limit myself. I can attest in my own experience alcohol is something I have to be very careful with. I am much more stable now that I am on hemlibra but I had a date 3 years ago where I had a few drinks and then in the middle of the date I had like a catastrophic bleed when I extended by knee too far.

Thanks for the link. Thank you! I have Von Willebrands so this was nice to know! I really do not understand how we are not at greater risk given that we cannot take blood thinners to combat the blood clots that form in the lungs from Covid. I am hoping it is because this is one symptom of COVID-19 that we are not susceptible to.  I am assuming that the excessive blood clotting is being seen in patients with otherwise normal coagulation profiles.  Maybe in our case, lacking a clotting factor is actually a benefit? To add to this, I did see a few studies awhile ago that said covid patients with blood clots had elevated levels of vwf. I think it is likely (at least for those of us with vwd) that lacking/having a deficiency in vwf is a benefit compared to those who clot normally. I am not sure what impact, if any, that would have on hemophiliacs though. I will come back later with sources/links to these studies.

Certainly it would be faster and more convenient for you! My daughter has it. If you suspect a bleed you should visit your hematologists for Amicar or Novo7.

This time, I was getting thick, colorful lines on my arm. Which means it is a lot bigger and more time consuming than previous tattoos. I started bleeding pretty bad. And he mentioned something about it and I asked if I was ok? Was I bleeding too much? He proceeded to tell me that he is not even supposed to get tattoos because he has hemophilia and that I would be fine. He just might have to turn it into a second session. I was like no way, me too. I did not say anything because I did not think you guys would tattoo me.  He was super understanding and said he would have no problem doing extra sessions with me. \n\nLong story short, the first person I have met that has hemophilia (outside of an event put on by an organization) was my tattoo artist.

I guess they are benefiting from a nice peak in their factor levels though which is something you mild guys might not have the luxury of, as for the most part I know that milds do not get access to preventative treatment they can use at home... though if you can, it might be something worth exploring with your haemophilia team... if they are an understanding one! I recently directed and shot a short (pharma sponsored) film with a severe A dude with full sleeve tattoos talking about it all. Once it is public I will be sure to drop a link back here Oh that film sounds awesome. I know there is like a nasal spray I can take to help. I went to the dentist to get a filling and then scheduled my next filling, but they told me I had to get that nasal spray for 700 dollars before I could get my second filling. All because of a small shot to the mouth, which was not an issue the first time. And for serious stuff like surgeries, my older brother and I had to take factor. He had wisdom teeth removed. I got into a car accident and had to have back surgery. Apparently those are 10,000 a bottle though. What kind of preventative treatment do severe people get? I am only 20 and I do not know a whole lot about hemophilia even though I have it. Which is the reason I joined this subreddit. But as far as the tattoo, the artist told me that I was good. The extra bleeding was just messing up his end of things by the ink not staying. Obviously he is no doctor, but I trusted it and I was fine. I was a little bit scared with how much I was bleeding until I found out he was also a hemophiliac. Also on the point of being rare, I think I was the only person in my high school to have it.

Life is just happening to me.\n\nAre you able to? How do you? It is different for everybody. Sometimes you just cannot be as consistent as you would like, but, from my experience, being prepared and adaptable are the only things you can do. \n\nYou have probably heard your whole life that you need to establish a treatment schedule that works for you and make sure your hemophilia is managed per your doctors. It is ingrained in our memories because it is true and will help minimize problems later in life.\n\nWhat types of problems are you having and what types of goals do you want to set and accomplish?\n Thank you for answering. I would not like to continue this conversation because I come from a totally different environment i.e a developing country. So about treatment schedule, well for now, there is none. No problem, chief. Good luck I have been in the same shoes, and to be honest life's just going to get worse as it goes on like this with more and more of your joints getting affected.

In addition to the bleeding disorder, I also have a chronic pain condition (endometriosis) and having this surgery means I will no longer have the AWFUL periods I once had.

I am thinking about looking for and hopefully learning a kind that is lower impact, more based on flexibility, swiftness, and technique than on impact. I am Severe B, I did Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and kickboxing when in my early teens. It was a great workout. I lost some weight which had a great impact on my ankles, and I got a lot more flexible. I did not really have to limit myself too much. I just knew my boundaries. I wore a helmet and shinpads when doing kickboxing, and the only thing that I really would notice in the days after doing it is that my sides would hurt from getting thrown. The jiu-jitsu was great, and I imagine a hemophiliac could be competitive in it without much worry. Only reason I stopped was because of an unrelated knee injury that kept me off the mat for like 4 months. Thanks for your answer! I am severe too but A. I would imagine I just infuse before practicing. Did you practice the Jiu Jitsu once a week? \n\nI do like increasing my flexibility, which I have done before when I was doing yoga all the time. However, I like the appeal of building some more muscle through a more active craft. ( competed in the UFC a few times before retiring due to being a Hemophiliac.  It is definitely possible.   Believe in yourself and go for it, IMO. Twice a week, and I am on prophy. At the time I had it Tuesday and Thursday, and I was on benefix so I infused Monday, Wednesday, Saturday. But I am on alprolix now. I would suggest doing your infusion the day of practice in that case. Wow. Yeah I def do not want to do any heavy impact stuff but more of the cool agile jumping, kicking, and self defense techniques Tai chi. It is very highly recommended for Hemophiliacs and those with other bleeding conditions. Wing Chun Kung Fu - highly focused on technique and being efficient in effort.  My husband (severe B) did it for four years until time constraints became too much.

Call your hematologists to get an infusion of HumateP and lysteda pills. \nAre you tracking your blood loss? The easiest way to track blood loss is by using a menstrual cup. Most menstrual cups hold 30ml of blood so you record that every time it is full. If finances are holding you back, there are grants to provide coverage for HumateP Thanks! I guess I should have clarified that I already contacted my hematologist and gyno. I already had appointments set up for the beginning of February to get on birth control for this reason.  Both told me to ride it out until those appointments unless it gets too terrible. The CDC and the NHF have a great calendar reference that I give out to my patients with VWD and heavy periods.\n\n\n\nIt has a scoring system and date so you can track and be sure that you are not also have irregular cycles. When I was going off birth control, a user on here recommended taking folic acid. It seems to help me. But you really should be able to call your gyno and ask for tranxemic acid or something. Do not wait until it is unbearable.  how do the points correlate to ml of blood? Do you know? Like at what point should I be worried. On an average period I lose 400-500ml every 26-27 days. I know that is really bad so I am trying to get it down below 200ml lost (using lysteda and factor infusions to try to get that number lower) The points are a way of alarming to action.

For USians who might be geoblocked\n\n\nNot intended for U.S. and UK Media\nBayer receives US approval for modern hemophilia A treatment Jivi\u00ae with a step-wise prophylaxis dosing regimen\n\nJivi\u2019s extended half-life allows for twice-weekly initial dosing / May be adjusted to every five days and further individually adjusted to less or more frequent dosing\n\nBerlin, August 30, 2018 \u2013 Bayer announced today that the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Jivi\u00ae (BAY94-9027) for the routine prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A in previously treated adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older in the U.S. The recommended initial prophylactic regimen for Jivi is twice weekly, with the ability to dose every five days and further individually adjust to less or more frequent dosing based on bleeding episodes. The FDA also approved Jivi for on-demand treatment and the perioperative management of bleeding in the same population. This approval is based on results from the Phase 2/3 PROTECT VIII trial. Jivi is the third FDA-approved hemophilia A treatment in Bayer\u2019s hemophilia portfolio.\n\n\u201cAs a physician who treats hemophilia A patients with a range of individualized needs, Jivi\u2019s approved dosing allows me to adjust frequency based on their bleed episodes to maintain protection from bleeds, which is a serious concern among patients,\u201d said Mark Reding, M.D., PROTECT VIII Lead Investigator and Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota. \u201cJivi is a welcome option that addresses a growing patient need to integrate treatment with personal lifestyles.\u201d\n\n\u201cJivi is a uniquely designed recombinant Factor VIII product approved in the U.S. for adults and adolescents that offers proven efficacy with the potential for reduced infusion frequency,\u201d said Dr. Joerg Moeller, Member of the Executive Committee of Bayer AG's Pharmaceutical Division and Head of Research and Development. \u201cTherefore, the FDA approval is an important step forward for patients with hemophilia A in the U.S. Bayer has also submitted marketing authorization applications for Jivi in the European Union and Japan.\u201d\n\nAbout Jivi\u00ae (BAY94-9027) \n\nBAY94-9027 was engineered to have an extended half-life by harnessing proven PEG-technology that delivers higher sustained levels of FVIII, which extends the blood\u2019s ability to coagulate for longer. Jivi is approved for the routine prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A in previously treated adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older. Jivi\u2019s initial recommended dosing regimen is twice weekly (30-40 IU/kg) with the ability to dose every five days (45-60 IU/kg) and further individually adjust to less or more frequent dosing based on bleeding episodes. The FDA also approved Jivi for on-demand treatment and the perioperative management of bleeding in the same population.\n\nJivi is a rFVIII replacement therapy, meaning it replaces the reduced or missing FVIII in adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with hemophilia A. As a site-specifically PEGylated FVIII, Jivi has a half-life of 17.9 hours that delivers sustained levels in the blood. rFVIII replacement therapy is the standard of care to stop or prevent bleeding and has proven efficacy and safety established over decades of clinical trials and real-world experiences.\n\nAbout PROTECT VIII study\n\nThe FDA approval of Jivi is supported by results of the pivotal Phase 2/3 PROTECT VIII trial comprised of prophylactic dosing, on-demand treatment, and perioperative management in previously treated adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older with severe hemophilia A. \n\nThe PROTECT VIII study was a 36-week, international, open label trial. Overall 126 patients completed the main study. Part A evaluated pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Jivi for on-demand treatment of bleeds and for prophylactic therapy at different dosing regimens. An optional extension study was available to subjects who completed Part A to assess Jivi over at least 100 accumulated exposure days, which demonstrated bleed protection and a good safety profile of up to a median of 1.9 years (range of 0-2.6 years). Part B evaluated safety and efficacy of Jivi during major surgery. Treatment with BAY94-9027 was generally well tolerated. \n\nAbout Bayer in Hemophilia \n\nBayer is driven by helping people with hemophilia thrive. We have a deep understanding of the evolving needs and aspirations of people with hemophilia, established over 25 years of partnering with the hemophilia community. FVIII replacement treatments are the standard of care to stop or prevent bleeding.

We work together with researchers, healthcare professionals and patient groups to build a strong community and help people with hemophilia live fulfilling lives. Bayer is passionate about spearheading research and investing in developing the next-generation of therapies and solutions to help people with hemophilia thrive both now and in the future.\n\nAbout Hemophilia A\n\nHemophilia affects approximately 400,000 people around the world and is a largely inherited disorder in which one of the proteins needed to form blood clots is missing or reduced. Hemophilia A is the most common type of hemophilia, in which blood clotting is impaired because there is a lack or defect of coagulation FVIII. Patients therefore repeatedly experience bleeds in muscles, joints or other tissues, which can result in chronic joint damage over time. External injuries can have severe consequences if not treated appropriately, as the blood clots more slowly in these patients than in healthy individuals. Hemophilia A has an estimated frequency of 1 in 5,000 male live births, affecting people worldwide. For example, there are approximately 6,000 people with the condition in France, 3,500 in Germany, and 13,000 in the U.S. today.\n\nAbout Bayer\n\nBayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the Life Science fields of health care and agriculture.

Unfortunately, the best answer to questions like this is almost always **talk to your hematologist**. They are the most informed, both about the various medications and how they compare as well as how your particular situation might impact your decision. Hemophilia is a condition that is particularly sensitive to individual differences - people have dramatically different clotting profiles and varied reactions to different medications, and it is not something we will be able to provide you a ton of support with from afar (though certainly if anyone has any experience with these medications, feel free to post it!).  Personally I had almost no luck with feiba, however I took it mainly when I was very young and very active which may have worked against me. I currently take Novo and there seems to be a sweet spot right before I flare up too bad where it will work very well and has prevented the bleed all together many times. If I miss it, it usually wont help much at all. Everyone is different so I would highly recommend any person to see what fits them best and not decide off anyone elses experiences.\n\n\nThe best advice I ever got from my doctor was to do whatever I think works best because there just is not a one size fits all with anything concerning Hemophilia. neither, work on getting rid of the inhibitor, your quality of life increases dramatically. I was on both feiba and novo for 18 years of my beginning life and as a 25 yr old now I have so much pain and joint damage.

The time I spent at home used it to learn FL Studio, write and play video games.\n\nThanks to my prophylaxis I have only had a crisis due to blows, cuts or infections, which is normal. I recently did not have access to my prophylaxis so I spent more time in bed in those two weeks. That time I used it to make a new song (you can hear it here:  and write in my little project on technology publications safeshadow.com (content in spanish).\n\nThe point is, many times I have cried because I think I suffer from this disease. But I am not a disease, I have realized that somehow I have fulfilled many dreams still suffering from hemophilia. I have kept my days to do what I love and that gives meaning to my life, it must be what drives our days.\n\nA curious fact and also I would like to share is that, **apparently I have hemophilia due to a mutation.** Yes, in a way I am a xmen. My mother was exposed to chemicals as a child and that affected her, as I understood the doctors, nobody else in my family suffers from the disease. I live in Latin America and it is very worrying that most children who register with the disease come from families who do not suffer from it, **all thanks to exposure to chemicals.**\n\n**Chiquita Land Company was a company that was in Panama for a time, broke a few years ago. Their workers were exposed to chemicals and the area where these people lived was close to the plantations. These chemicals are what I mean.**\n\nI hope, I have not bored most with this story, but I thought it would be an interesting topic to discuss. I would like to see what you think about these points, and I need to ask, had you heard cases in which the chemists are guilty of creating this disease?", "Cannot find factor 8 I am a male hem a severe, and there is no factor 8 in the philippines.

Also another quick thought, have you tried contacting hemlibra directly to see they have assistance programs to provide it in your country?\nSome drug companies usually have programs to provide access to hemophilia drugs in countries where it is not produced Is that a nationwide shortage in the Philippines? At the start of the pandemic, I asked my HTC if I should stock up factor and start rationing, but so far I have not intercepted any signals of a shortage.

The ( study seems to point out that 36% of those diagnosed ended up having normal levels at the time the study was done. Additionally, Dr. JA ( , former president of the American Society of hematology, wrote that we diagnose VWD in search of a cause, and that \u201cmany persons diagnosed with VWD type 1, perhaps most of them, do not have a disease at all.\u201d Now the article was wrote in 2003 but many of the diagnostic standards from back then remain the same today. We still use VWF antigen, Ristocetin cofactor testing or the newer VWF:GPIbM test, and factor VIII antigen test. I am curious to hear what some other bleeders have to say about this. Maybe. I mean it is not really been studied as much as haemophilia, I was diagnosed in 1981 but not given a \u00ab\u00a0type\u00a0\u00bb until the 2000\u2019s. And the genetic inheritance pattern my parents were told when I was a child was not accurate. \n\nI guess it is also determining what you class as the condition. \n\nMost diseases have variations and degrees of severity within those variations. I have type 2a, which is moderate for most, but severe for me as basically none of the VWF I produce actually does anything. \n\nSo you could have a mild mild form. May not affect everyday life but if it came to trauma or childbirth it might make a difference? I think so.  I have a diagnosis of VWD but my hematologist does not believe I have it.  It is just an easy term for insurance, which will not cover treatment for \"unspecified bleeding disorder,\" and since FFP and TXA seem to work for me VWD is as good a Dx as anything.  My factor levels are often borderline but rarely actually low.   We think I most likely have a platelet disorder that is not showing up in testing.  \n\nI have had four bleeds requiring hospitalization in addition to other symptoms so yes I definitely have a bleeding disorder. From a genetic testing perspective, Von Willebrand is much harder to test for than classic hemophilia A or B. That is the reason that the diagnostic standard is still the lab tests and not genetic testing, which would be easier to have a yes/no answer, as VWD factors rise and fall naturally. Possibly, and I know some Hematologists believe this based on personal experience, but I also feel like this might be a slippery slope, both from my own personal experience and after reading the linked articles and some references.\n\nI might have to read these articles a few more times, but I feel they contradict themselves often. The second article at one point seems to say desmopressin treatment is dangerous for those misdiagnosed with VWD, but then goes on to say it should be used in people misdiagnosed with VWD to mitigate bleeding risk associated with low VWF.....am I reading that right?\n\nI might just be a little salty about the whole thing as someone who did have a new hematologist I was seeing after I moved believe I was misdiagnosed with VWD Type 1 after my levels came back barely above the minimum cutoff for normal one time, but I had a history of much lower levels and lots of bleeding issues (documented and files transferred to this one's office), and my mother and most of her family has always had bleeding issues too. My mother was also diagnosed with VWD Type 1. The new hematologist wanted to run all sorts of other expensive tests on me, including things I had done recently as part of a biometric screening, and had paperwork to show those other tests came back normal (she would not look at any of my previous tests).  I had already been prescribed desmopressin by my previous hematologist and it worked well for me to control bleeding episodes (I had the challenge done and everything to confirm it worked for me), but this other hematologist would not renew my prescription because she did not believe I had VWD.  I had to find a different hematologist.\n\nI think what unnerves me the most about studies like this is it feels like they are championing telling people like me who have severe bleeding issues and have found VWD treatments work for them that because their levels are \"almost normal\", there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. I feel like it is a slippery slope that could cause some doctors to not give those treatments anymore to everyone that needs them, and instead withhold them for people who only have \"the most severe cases\". My levels would not indicate I would be one of those people, but my bleeding episodes without treatment would land me in the ER. I could see it. I have been diagnosed with type 1 but my levels have been within the normal range every time they have been tested since my diagnosis. I have always found it so odd that VWD is not studied as much as Hemophilia especially given how much more prevalent VWD is than Hemophilia. Type 2 is definitely in a class of its own though since it is qualitative. IMO people in VWF antigen range of 30-50 should be a separate category like Sadler proposes. There just does not seem to be a need for a diagnosis in that range if there is no clinically significant bleeding. I think you may have had a misread there with the Stimate. I do not think he was saying it is dangerous I think he was just saying it is unnecessary if what he is saying is true and a majority of type 1s are misdiagnosed. Sounds like you got caught with a shitty hematologist though. I think that you kind of prove Sadler\u2019s point though as it seems like your levels were low, but not concerning on paper. I think a more patient centered diagnosis is necessary that takes into account bleeding history and family history, in conjunction with the lab values. I feel like for myself the lab values are the only thing being considered and the only reason VWD remains on my record, even though my VWF antigen levels are 45 and my Ristocetin levels were above normal. There seems to be a reluctancy for doctors to admit they are wrong and it seems to be a disservice to the patients. A lot of women are diagnosed with VWD but their VWF gets normal at the time of giving birth. My doctors are always tasting my VWF levels and all the other components that keep the bleeding under control. The thing is that the results of the tests are changing all the time. I could say that the amount of VWF can increase in my body every now and then, but other times it can be really low so my periods get worse and the symptoms are more noticeable. I guess so. Although say for example haemophilia carriers often have more or less normal FVIII levels. But they drop sharply postpartum, so then someone with no clinically significant bleeding beforehand has a problem. \nIt also depends what you consider clinically significant - those of us with a uterus bleed every month and that can cause problems with even very mild VWD. The levels also drop postpartum - it is nice to know if your at risk of bleeding out after childbirth! \n\nAnd it has not been studied because medicine is regrettably historically focused on the male sex...(I work in medicine, it really is!) Have you had any bleeding problems since being diagnosed? The only issue I ever had before being diagnosed was 3 postpartum hemorrhages. After being diagnosed I bled quite severely with a miscarriage but managed at home with ddavp.

However, the anesthesiologist (who was incredible by the way) said she felt more comfortable administering it through the IV to be sure I got a more precise dose.

Analysts at  Jeffries have predicted that it could generate $5 billion in annual  sales \u2013 provided its use for hemophilia A is widened to the larger,  non-inhibitor population. Just a month ago, the US Food and Drug  Administration has accepted the supplemental Biologics License  Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review for Hemlibra for adults  and children with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors, an  indication that would attract a much wider patient population than  currently available.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The drug received marketing authorization from the European Medicines  Agency for use in the UK in February 2018.

And just forget about using warm anything, the bleed is supplying all the heat it needs and more.  So when I cold compress only for 10-20? Then cool down for another 10-20? If I still feel pain, do I have to wait for 10-20? My doctor said, I should warm compress on my iliopsoas after 24 hours on cold compress. I have to put 15 mins of warm compress This is where I am confused. You are talking about icing an injury, correct? Icing and cold and warm compresses are not meant to get rid of pain by any means. The point of icing is to keep the swelling down.  Feel free to message me if you want to talk further. Always happy to help however I can. Anecdotal, but I would only ever use ice, and I never swell so I use it exclusively for pain relief. And I basically keep it on there as long as needed. \n\nI agree with u/DataSetMatch that heat is not an effective treatment for bleeds. I would think it would just allow it to continue. Usually heat/cold alternating is used for things like muscle strains. I am usually told to wrap up my bleeds if they are on a limb. I am currently getting infusions for my knee after I dislocated my kneecap, and tweaked my whole leg. So I get an ace bandage wrap and make sure it is loose enough that I still have circulation, but tight enough to keep compression. I also ice on for 20 min off for 20 min. \n\nMight just be anecdotal as well here, but maybe it helps :) Thank you, I will be going tom to CIBD. I hope they could find out how will I fix my right knee dislocation and my iliopsoas that took so long to heal. No, thank you! Without so many hemophiliacs we would not have a thriving community, full of kind and loving people. We have to stick together, because who knows better about how to help us, than ourselves?\n\nI hope they will find out how to treat you too, good luck my friend, and best wishes! :D Yes all hemophiliacs must unite! God bless you!  God bless you too!", "Hemophiliacs - are you getting the COVID vaccine? Just wondering. I am debating whether or not to get it. \n\n( WFH issued guidance on timing factor with the injection. \nThis is not going to go to away unless as many people as possible get vaccinated! I get the influenza vaccination every year. The flu does not seem to be going anywhere despite such vaccinations. What makes you think the SARS CoV 2 vaccines would be any different? I do not. But you do not get the flu every year because you get the vaccine! It is how they work. Millions of others do not get the flu because they have the vaccine. Which in turn means they do not act as vectors for people who cannot have vaccines (like those having chemo). Same with Covid. Even if you are asymptomatic - you may accidentally pass it on to someone who it could kill.\nIf it turns out we need the Covid vaccine every year then you have it with your flu shot every year. \nBut right now it is causing chaos and vaccination seems the only way out. Unless you want to be locked in your house for a year whilst it burns itself out?? People with bleeding and coagulation issues have been advised not to take the vaccine yet. I got my first round a few weeks ago (RN at a large teaching hospital) and am due for my second on the 20th. I have had no side effects whatsoever. My arm did not even hurt. I know very few people who have actually had a reaction to the vaccine, if that eases anyone\u2019s mind. I\u2018ll definitely get it once available. The Austrian Hemophilia Association also recommended everyone to get vaccinated and stated that there are no dangers or side effects for people with Hemophilia Hey there, would you mind sharing a source for that? The Austrian Hemophilia Association recommend everyone to get vaccinated and stated that there are no dangers or side effects for people with Hemophilia They say proceed with caution, though I do not see how one does that.\n\n The Association of Hemophilia Clinic Directors of Canada is recommending that us Canadian hemophiliacs get it. As a health care worker I will be getting it in the next few weeks. \n\n( Which vaccine did you receive? Pfizer! I would like to hear more from the people who are voting no. i always got told to never get a vaccine injection in my muscles, but then again they havent informed me yet about how and what with covid vaccine. (  I do not think I will get it but other people\u2019s circumstances, such as elderly family members, may sway me. Thanks for sharing this! There was a case in Hungary where a fellow Hemophiliac got the virus and had bleedings in his lungs. I guess that is a good reason to get the vaccine, but it is your call after all. Hmmmmm..... think of it this way. So if you got an STD (sexually transmitted infection/disease) and displayed no symptoms (asymptomatic) does that mean you would not pass it on? NO......YES? Of course you would.\n\nGo spread your terrible misinformation else where.\n\nI think you need to do your scientific research before posting such pure idiocy! &gt; How exactly can you pass Covid to someone if you are asymptomatic? You do not cough, you do not sneeze etc. Did anyone explain that?\n\nYou are still breathing.  That is exactly how you can pass it to someone else.\n\nEdit: Also, ( Please be careful making posts like this. I generally am also curious but unfortunately, anti vaccination \"activists\" are currently trying to infiltrate as many \"niche\" online communities as possible (wellness, community groups, health/disability etc) to concern troll about vaccination and get some air on their views outside of antivax echo chambers.\n\n For my part I will get the vaccine the first day I am offered it.  I am just generally curious, esp. after seeing articles like this: (\n\nThe doctor was diagnosed with some kind of blood clotting disorder  (\"acute immune thrombocytopeniaafter\") after getting the vaccine and then died.  Although different types of disorders, I do not know if they have tested the vaccine on hemophiliacs/others with blood clotting disorders and am wondering what everyone else is thinking. Sorry I did not mean to attack you in my post, I was agreeing That this thread in general is coming from curiosity rather than any secret agenda.\n\nI doubt they have tested it on too many hemophiliacs specifically because there just are not that many of us. But with WHO/WFH/national society guidance all saying there is no added risk to us having the vaccine, I feel pretty reassured. Science has helped keep you alive I assume. \n\nIn regards to historical treatment issues, we live in a different time now \u2018mate\u2019, and those problems will never happen again in the same way due to modern medicine - not historical methods. Also totally irellivant to the subject in hand - and rude if you ask me.\n\nI am sure there will be a subreddit out there for you to help others feed off your terrible, outdated and misinformed slush. Fuck yes I am, as soon as I can. I plan on getting it, but I know I am bottom of the list and that is okay because I am a borderline hermit anyways and my gf got half the vaccine already, so if shit hits the fan shes doing the grocery shopping doctor told me not to, as a severe hemophilic My hematologist at the hospital I go to And so is your attitude Thanks for proving my point Care to elaborate on why you would not get it? And your understanding of protecting elderly family members, that is great - but the list goes on from there, not just your elderly family, all elderly and anyone who is more vulnerable is worth helping to protect? No? \nUnless you can wow me (and probably others) with your views, then I believe you are also a huge part of the problem and will add to the delay in the rest us getting back to a sense of normality. That is a shame you are Haematologist gave you that advice, it may be worth getting a second professional opinion on that. There is no evidence or information to support that reasoning. There is some links added from some other comments which have advice from national and worldwide Haemophilia associations. Your responded to what I was saying so clearly I do. It is just not one that you agree with and you cannot accept that. To answer your question, I have not yet researched which vaccine I should be taking and what the side effects are of each, which of course I should do sooner rather than later.\n\nI am open to other people\u2019s opinions and advice but it is difficult to have conversations with people who cannot accept other people\u2019s decisions and who label people as the problem because they themselves are set in their ways. I think I said part of the problem, not the problem.\n\nDo some research, then you may have a much better armoured response other than \u2018Set in their ways\u2019. \n\nOut of curiosity - have you ever had the measles vaccination, smallpox vaccination, mumps, rubella etc? Probably as a child but none the less.... that will be why that does not raise its head as a worldwide epidemic in the modern day. I am 100% aware. I wear masks all the time, sanitise and stay at home as much as possible. Please do not make unwarranted assumptions. My response was my response...which you asked for? \n\nTo answer your second question, I have had some vaccinations as a child but not all. There were some concerns about my haemophilia at that stage. You call it a response, I call it mindless. \nGo get educated and then come back with a response worth sharing or do not discredit something you obviously know nothing about. I did not discredit anyone getting the vaccine. The OP asked a question, I provided my perspective saying that I may get it...Do not engage in a conversation with me if you cannot handle a view that you are not happy with. I can quite handle your response, do not you worry. Disagreeing with your response is something that I believe you cannot handle. Short and tall of it - do your research, wear a mask, wash your hands and get the vaccine. Or do not as I believe from your responses here and within the thread you seem like a selfish kind of person. But I already said I wash my hands, wear masks etc. Appreciate it was in response to someone else. Anyway it is clear you want me to get the vaccine. Point noted!! Marvellous I might look into a second opinion then Got the first round last week. Sore shoulder, some fatigue and nausea. Nothing severe. I took a dose of factor before the shot and iced the injection site for 15 minutes after. Same. Yes, planning on getting it, already checked with my HTC, just to make sure they did not have any reservations, and they did not. Soon as I can get one, I will be. I would definitely double check. I go to the Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, which is one of the top treatment centers, and they were quite supportive of it. \n\nThat said, everyone is health is different of course, so maybe there is a reason. You could probably even just call some of the well known ones and ask their general opinions.", "Do you ever think there will be a cure for Hemophilia and VWD? Just as the title suggests; do you think there will ever be a cure for Hemophilia and/or VWD? If so, when do you think we could see it, and if not, why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advanced for the answers, I will make sure to reply to all of you! In the past some folks have gotten a liver transplant and their factor levels returned to normal but then you are stuck with anti-rejection drugs for life so trading one problem for another.\n\nGene therapy is the likely solution and has shown some real promise in animal models but it seems that these do not translate well to humans in this case and so no Nobel prizes yet. Add to that the fact that the US pumped the brakes on research using fetal tissue decades ago, that has really slowed things down.\n\nA lot of pharmaceutical companies pivoted to the sub-q treatments we have now like hemlibra and the others I cannot remember right now. These can take you from a prophylactic dose every few days to once a week and with the likely possibility of once a month after the data comes in.\n\nPutting this all together, I am sure there will be a cure in the form of gene therapy or perhaps pre natal gene editing likely with crispr to essentially cause the genes to die out with the exception of random mutations. \n\nHowever that is likely a long way off. Put simply, what we have now is good enough and light-years beyond what was around even 30 years ago. We are not dying off and can more or less live a normal life so things will likely stay the same with marginal improvements over the coming decades as research is targeted to more problematic issues.\n\n\nJust my $.02, not a doctor, but I do periodically do some deep diving into research. By all means please talk to your local HTC or physician and they can advise you about the state of current research and treatments. I am a bit cynical when it comes to cures. It is big big money treating someone who has a disease or disorder. You have a cash crop of people who need life saving medication, why stop it? Guaranteed income. \n\nYou could have a liver transplant, but you will spend the rest of your life still having to take medications so your body does not reject the organ. I met one person a long time ago who had a liver transplant and was living \"normally\", bit I do not know what meds he took or the circumstances behind the transplant. I cannot imagine it was as simple as \"I have Hemophilia and would like a new liver\". My son (born 2018) has severe A. I find some comfort in the fact that human trials are already being performed, and not just some test tube dream. When he is an adult, in 15 years or so,  I really hope there will be a \"cure\". It might be expensive, yes. But the medication for a lifetime is expensive too. The Swedish healthcare system is very good and they would see the big picture and pay for an expensive \"cure\", Im sure. Yes\u2026soon\u2026gene therapy is the key Honestly I hope for there to be one soon. I am just about to turn 19 and I have had VWD since I was born. As other people have said I am able to live a normal life to some degree but it still sucks to have it; though I do hope that your son does well with it, and if you need any advice on the disorder feel free to ask me :)\n\n\\ I just hope the gene therapy will be something good both short and long term and not just some short term fix lol Hemophilia A has the most progress in gene therapy\u2026.I have heard it is very close to\nhaving some type of cure\u2026everything else will follow suit\u2026it is a great time for the blood\nDisorder community! I have been hearing that for 15 years. It does not seem as close as they were thinking. And gene therapy trials seem to be pretty hard in the patients. I am an optimist, but I think it is a long way off still, and hardly a cure. Treatments are getting better though. For me a \u201ccure\u201d would be something similar to Hemlibra but that spike the real factor level above 80% and only to shoot it once every month. \n\nI would accept that as a cure. Gene therapy eventually. Current target is around 10 year effectiveness, which will increase over time.\n\nBut at this point in my life, I feel like a cure would only be helpful in an emergency situation. I would still be left with all the joint damage and pain even if I was cured today. Nice to hear! We feel very fortunate. Our healthcare system has been very good to us. No antibodies and the prophylactic treatment is working wonders. I have met a family with the same starting point, but they are going through hell on a daily basis it seems. Antiebodies, bleeds, bad doctors, accidents, you name it, they have done it. We feel very \"normal\" as long as we do the injections. **Here are some snippets of information from my articles:**\n\nIn 1964, a way to produce an antihemophilic factor was identified by Judith Graham Pool of Stanford University. This antihemophilic factor was approved for commercial use in 1971 in the United States and was called Cryoprecipitated AHF. The plasma for hemophiliacs could be stored by blood banks. \n\nNow, we have subcutaneous shots that can be taken months apart for hemophilia treatment.\n\nThe overall hemophilia market is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR), of 5.9%. That would bring the market size in 2027 to a massive 19.1 billion dollar industry. \n\nAt the current rate of progression for hemophilia and other bleeding disorder research, I do think that someday, maybe very soon, we will have a cure for Hemophilia. You can read more about all of this on my website: HemoTalk.tk \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Join the community!** HemoTalk.tk Yes! The key is CRISPR. They have already had success in eradicating VWD from 2 types of fish. Even if they had found it, they will not release it. At one point in time, the price of factor was equivalent to gold.", "mallory weiss tear with weed? hello,\nthrowaway account for obvious reasons\na little while ago I smoked a cartridge. When I had first received it there was not a lot left. The person that I had gotten it from said he had hit it (originally it was a full gram) and was fine. I smoked it for a few days and everything was great up until one night. This one night I had smoked it started out great but soon took a turn for the worst. After a few hits I started to feel my breathing turn shallow, I had the worst panic attack of my life and felt as if I could not catch my breath. I felt like I had something in my throat and I could not cough it out. I ran downstairs to grab some water and tried to calm down but almost felt like I was going to faint before I could make it upstairs again. The previous days I was using it for I could not stay awake and I was almost immediately asleep. A few days later I woke up one morning and was experiencing upper gi bleeding. I was light headed, short of breath, had a ton of anxiety, stool was black and tarry, and I was vomiting blood. The doctor said I had a mallory-weiss tear. Out of the hospital and recovering I am now scared to ever smoke weed again, cartridges are over with for sure but I am wondering if it would even be a good idea to even try bud? I never smoked prior to this. While recovering I felt like I was going through withdrawal. Loss of appetite, shallow breathing, terrible anxiety and depression. Could it be I was given something bad? A fake cartridge? My only sense of relief is that the person who I received it from said he almost finished it off. I suffer from hemophilia Preliminary follow-up: was this recreational or therapeutic?\n\nFirst, this does not sound like a particularly hemophilia-related issue.\n\nSecond, let this be a lesson to you: if a drug - OTC, prescription or otherwise - looks weird, you probably should not consume it. Trust your gut, otherwise you might end up shitting blood and going to the hospital.\n\nThird, the safety of vapes is still somewhat of an open question and smoking is still smoking. Maybe you should stick to something a little easier to process like edibles? a little bit of both. I had a bleed at the time. \nit seems like it is not a hemophilia issue, though the doctor did say without hemophilia I would not have been vomiting blood. seems like those that smoke that I know have hemophilia have never experienced near what I experienced but I believe my levels are a lot higher than theirs are. I am wondering it you ever experienced something similar? wondering if a bong or bubbler and a permanent switch would be good? i am not even sure if i can smoke anymore at all...what do other hemophiliacs say and has anyone experienced something similar? I have never done THC in any form, but we have had a few marijuana threads so you might want to get in touch w/ the people who have posted in those.\n\nMy general advice when it comes to anything of this nature is, do not give your body any more of an excuse to give you problems than it already has. Most hemophiliacs I have known smoke a lot of weed. I have never heard of anyone having hemophilia related issues of any kind from smoking. Stay away from cartridges tho, they are sketchy. Let yourself heal up and if you do decide to smoke , go light at first. Maybe you have an allergy to weed or something in the vape pen. You never know. I do not think it has anything to do  with hemophilia tho, except like the dr said, maybe if something caused you to bleed you bled more. thanks a lot man. only problem I think it could ever be is maybe my levels are so high (I have the highest levels that I know of between relatives/friends) that maybe it is just different for me? nobody seems to experience this either between my friends or relatives and some of them are just a few levels under me. wondering if I just have to seclude myself to edibles or something or maybe get onto bud and try something like a bubbler or a bong? really bad situation though and I am so scared to smoke again but it really opens me up mentally and is a great relief to bleeds even though it does not take care of them completely (obviously). Yea I hear you. Weed helped me a lot when I was younger deal with different aspects of hemophilia. It is hard to explain how, but it did. \nIt sounds to me what most likely happened it that something was wrong with that pen you were using or it malfunctioned somehow and messed you up. Then you puked, correct? A Mallory Weiss tear can happen to anyone from throwing up. Once it happens it would be harder to control the bleeding for a hemophiliac obviously, but I do not think it happened because of hemophilia. I think it was a fluke, just a weed cartridge or vape pen that went bad or you had a reaction to the chemicals in the device and it irritated you and when you threw up it caused the tear. Then you bled into your stomach and puked that up as well, also making the tear worse. Anyway my point is, yea, let it heal all up. Then try an edible, to make sure you are not allergic to weed or something, which I highly doubt you are (I like edibles better anyway, smoking too much kind of messes up my lungs and I like to breath clear). Then if you are are not allergic , and you still want to smoke, just smoke a bowl out of a pipe. A hit or two is all you will need of the super crip that is everywhere now. See how that goes. Do not be afraid, if you are allergic to weed , a couple hits will just upset your stomach and you will know that smoking is not for you. My good friend and house mate (renter) has this thing called cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome (google it?) \nWhen he smokes too much weed he gets really sick to his stomach and it makes him have terrible GI problems (puking, diarrhea) , but he has no trouble with edibles. It is not super uncommon to have this, that could be what happened to you too. I would not be surprised. If you puked a bunch (which is what happens with this) that could have easily caused the tear. I do not know if there is a test to see if you have cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome , but you will know if every time you smoke you get super sick. So you will have to try edibles then, edibles do not seem to cause it, just smoking does. Look into it I bet that is what happened. Either that or a bad pen. I do not trust a mechanical devise with batteries to smoke out of anyway, the heaters in them release metals in the smoke that have got to be toxic (that is my paranoia anyway). But yea look that up Cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome. The more I think about it and how my friend describes it the more it sounds like that is what it might be. He deals with it all the time, he always tries smoking and regrets it, then makes a bunch of edibles and he is good for a few months until he tries smoking again and it completely wrecks him.", "I made a comic about hemophilia.

Adjust as the swelling goes down. Slings would not help me, often making them worse\u2014would usually gently grab onto the lower part of my shirt instead. \n\nIf you can get ahold of ice when you feel it coming on, that is the key time to apply it.\n\nI do not know how in-tune you are with your body, but there is a tingling and borderline pulsating sensation like \u201cblood is leaking internally\u201d whenever a bleed starts, at least for me. Hard to describe.  Thanks sa pag suggest kuya! Yung anti inflammatory po ba yun? Saka ano po side effects nung Tramadol? As of now I cannot sleep, I keep putting ice pack and bandaging my palm so that it can ease the pain a little bit. We currently have a group here in Visayas waiting for the donation. Thank you! What my mom usually if I swell like this is pinapainom ako ng Paracetamol Biogesic para maibsan yung pain and then Hemostan para raw mag clot yung dugo from what I heard hehe.\n\n\n\n Oml so true! That is what I also do! Right now I wrap my hands with bandage and put some ice on mt elbow. I feel like it hurts more when I lay down. So I do is sit or just walk sometimes. Yes! Hemostan works great. Nakalimutan ko banggitin kasi wala ako stock ngayon haha. Be careful with local Paracetamol brands. Do not take ones like Alaxan that have Ibuprofen. My hematologist said Ibuprofen could cause bleeding. Tramadol is for the pain. Yung pinapahid na diclofenac is anti-inflammatory.\n\nI usually get LBM from Tramadol, sometimes migraine din and weakness and nahihilo. Oo nga po, biogesic lang talaga pinapainom ni mama para pampaalis pain. Saka yung kinesiology tape hindi recommended ilagay sa elbow. Lumalala la huhu Ahh nako ganun po ba. May fear pa naman ako sa pag vomit hahaha Good luck! I hope you find meds and remedies that are right for you.\n\nMy right elbow actually hurts right now din hahaha, timing na timing. It is been swelling since last night Pag nag work nga po ako online so sa pc naglalagay ako ng unan under sa elbow ko wala pa din haha dapat may bandage talaga ata. Thanks po kuya. Sana nga, di ako nakatulog ngayon sa sakit e. I not sure how much celecoxib costs over there but it is a great medicine for pain and inflammation that will not cause excessive bleeding like ibuprofen.\n\nAvoid all other NSAIDs and aspirin.\n\nUse ice and a splint to reduce movement until it heals.  I have had a history of elbow bleeds since I was a child. Apart from what everyone else has said (which is all great advice), elbow strengthening was the ultimate solution to get my bleeds to tone down. Forgot to mention, but I figured out that the main cause of the \u201cspontaneous\u201d elbow bleeds were from laying my head on my arm or placing my arm under the pillow while sleeping. If you tend to do this, changing how you lay in bed could help prevent them.\n\nSometimes I would lay my arm at a right angle on top of my head when sleeping. Pulls the blood flow away from the elbow.  When I sleep, I let my arms rest or extend, I do not sleep like folding them because when I wake up I will feel like something is wrong. Thank you. I never heard of that but anti inflammatory ointment here costs like 500 pesos or nearly $10. Ohh okay thank you for that. Mostly all of the time my left elbow bleeds and now my right elbow bleeds. It is like they are switching. It is a pill   \n\n**NOTE: This technique is NOT a replacement for Factor VIII nor will it stop a bleed. It will, however, prevent chronic repeat bleeds. You are still going to get bleeds, but not nearly as many.**\n\nEvery joint bleed, whether it is a knee, ankle or elbow, starts in the same place: a capsule of tissue surrounding the joint called the synovial membrane. The synovial membrane has tiny blood vessels in it that break when the joint is overextended, stressed, or moved suddenly. In ordinary people, this bleeding stops almost immediately; in haemophiliacs, it does not. You get a joint bleed.\n\nThe technique I have developed uses heavy-duty sports tape to support, reinforce and protect the synovial membrane.  Sports tape is both adhesive and elastic. Just like the synovial membrane, it sticks AND it stretches. \n\nThe rule is: an anchor point, one turn, and some overlap (if you message me with your email, I will send you a PDF with pictures). You can use two layers after an ankle bleed for extra support but one layer is usually enough. Do not make it tight. It should be firm but comfortable. If it is not comfortable, adjust it. \n\n  *When to use it*\n\n\\- For a couple of days after a bleed that you have treated so that the synovial membrane has a chance to heal;\n\n\\- When you are about to do something that might cause a bleed; like shopping or going to the movies or a taxi ride when you are going to be walking or standing for a long time. Strap your knees or your ankles \u2013 whatever your problem area is \u2013 before you go out.\n\n*Tips and Tricks*\n\nIf you have got a lot of body hair, very carefully shave the joints you plan to tape. Not only will the tape stick better, it will come off easier.\n\nIf you wet the tape, it falls off.\n\nIf you are strapping a knee, tuck in the corners of the tape so that they do not stick to the inside of your pants leg.\n\nIf you stretch the tape too tight while cutting it, it will snap back and stick to itself.\n\n*Personal Note*\n\nI have severe haemophilia, a less than 1% Factor VIII deficiency. When I discovered this technique, I was having back-to-back repeat bleeds in both ankles. The repeat bleeds stopped.   \n\nEvery time I did bicep curls at gym, I had an elbow bleed. I was on prophylaxis for this for two years. Since I started using sports tape, the bleeds have stopped completely even though I am not on prophylaxis and I do bicep curls two or three times a week. \n\n Kathy Mulder, a Canadian physiotherapist who specialised in haemophilia, came up with the explanation for why sports tape works. I have discussed sports tape with the registrars and nursing staff at the Charlotte Maxeke haemophilia clinic here in Johannesburg, South Africa. No-one has ever suggested that it might do harm. ", "Organ donation I have never been able to get a straight answer for this but does anyone know if we can donate organs. I believe I am registered and I believe they will assess the quality of organs at the time of death. Obviously our livers suck but the rest should be fine to use. I have also never used human derived blood products and have been lucky enough to only use recombinants. Yes, you can be an organ donor after death. Depends on the hemophilia type and the organ you want to donate.   Hemophilia A:  Donate anything.  Hemophila B:  Not your liver (factor 9 is made in your liver exclusively and the recipient would develop hemophilia post transplant) .\n\nAll the other organs, eyes, skin, bones, heart, lungs, kidneys would be fine in the recipient. So Bs can donate a liver to someone they do not like, is what you are saying. No.  Just that factor 9 is only made in the liver.  If you put that into a recipient, they will not make a normal amount.  Same with other liver produced clotting factors. I think most people would choose life with Hemophilia B over dying from liver failure. Probably so, but I think you would have an ethics board and/or transplant committee that would disagree.  Basically intentionally giving your donor a disease.  If it was mild you would probably get approval but severe?  With the immune suppression after transplant that puts the recipient at risk for an anti factor 9 inhibitor? You meant recipient, right?\n\nI would argue that, with extended half-life products, you would be treating the hemophilia less frequently than you would be taking those immunosuppressive drugs.  Especially for an adult.\n\nAlso, would not an inhibitor be *less* likely because of the immunosuppressive drugs?\n\nPlus: House M.D. would just forget to mention the hemophilia to the transplant committee. Yes the recipient would be at risk.  Antihost immune reactions are seen after OLTx due to immune dysregulation.  Auto reactive B cell clones are normally suppressed by T cells.  The modern anti rejection strategies rely on inhibition of T cell activation and recruitment meaning that a clone of B cells that could react to 9 could produce antibodies giving the recipient severe hemophilia B and the feared anti factor 9 inhibitor.  The likelihood of this is very low. Most older hemophiliacs have Hep C.  I think 90% of us got it in the 1980s.  Older hemophiliacs cannot donate anything, even if we have reached SVR.", "Blood clots hit Roche hemophilia trial ", "UK Petition to investigate Bayer / Baxter over HIV-infected Factor ", "Injection site Hi hem a here just wondering what happens if i keep injecting at the same site. I somtimes do centimeter diffrences to not do ontop of it. Over the years and years its turned slightly brown the site. Just want some advice. Ty. Ohh while im at it, how bad is it if you inject outside of the vein accidentaly. Ty Scar tissue will eventually build up from all the track marks. Before Hemlibra, I would rotate which arm I used. Like switch every couple months.\n\nNo short terms drawbacks to injecting at the same site, since they are a couple days apart. Just try to get very small butterfly needles.\n\nUsing the same vein too much with large needles can lead to it valving up,  which mainly means you need a new site. I used the same site for about 14 or 15 years and it worked spectacularly, every time, until one day it indeed completely scarred up. Would not recommend, especially in a tent at a music festival!\n\n&gt;how bad is it if you inject outside of the vein accidentaly\n\nIf you miss the vein and you cannot get a draw, do not actually push any factor in - just pull out, ice it down and try another site (ideally a different location entirely). I use small needles and inject on left arm. I always inject 1-2 centimeters apart from last time Is switching to Hemlibra an option for you?  It is subq not IV. What Is subq not lV. Also im planning to use helimbra end of winter of 2022 so in the beggining of the year somwhat. I have over 1,000 sticks in my vein and I uses about 2 inch section. I use a 27g needle to scaring is minimal. Subcutaneous (subq) is an injection under the skin, not into a vein like intravenous (IV). Howdy, I have been self infusing my left wrist for 5 years now, my nerve turned little brown 5 months ago, I continued to do it, for like 3 months, then it happened. The blood stopped coming out, I tried to one more after a couple of days, it just stopped, as I was only depending on that vein, I was not able to find any new veins to poke to and honestly it is been hard since that vein became dummy. I usually get help from a nurse to infuse myself now, she told sometimes for cancer patients are such, the veins become tight and the blood stops flowing out, \nShe calls those veins \u201cdummies\u201d because the blood does not come out. So I recommend trying to find another vein, however, I am just a random guy on the internet, u can ask a nurse whenever ur close to one.\n\nAnd on the other question, the fluid does not really go inside ( if you use a butterfly) and it is often dry or weird, even though u force it, there will be obvious swelling and also pain. If prick the skin, u can apply some ice, it is not even bad tbh.\nTLDR: stop pricking the same site, it is not that bad if u prick skin I have been stabbing into the Median Cubutal for 40 years and the darn thing still holds up. \n\nNo reason to inject outside the vein- soon as you draw back you will know if you are in the vein or not. The best case is that you are wasting factor. I have been using the same 4-5 veins for 20+ years. I use a very small butterfly needle which keeps the scar tissue at a minimum. I have blown veins before and you know right away when you inject outside of the vein. It burns and swells up pretty fast. Yup. Saw this over the years with my son. Now 16. He knows immediately when he is outside the vein. \ud83d\udc4f My husband alternates which arm he infuses into as well and has not had problems injecting in the same sites 20+ years. I switched back and forth from right to left median cubital for 40ish years.  Scar tissue builds up but the butterflies always punched through with no problem.  I found using a smaller diameter (25 gauge maybe?) did less damage to my veins than a lower gauge.  A 20 or 18 gauge will let you push a lot faster but they tore my veins up and I started having trouble getting a good stick and return.  Rotate between a couple of spots (left and right arm for example), stick to higher gauge (smaller diameter) needles, and work from low to high on your area of preference (stick above the previous puncture to give it a chance to heal before going over the same area again) and you will be fine.  If you start having trouble getting into the vein, give it a rest for a week or so.  You can get a long time out of two areas an inch or so long if you are careful and adjust if you start having problems.  If you inject outside the vein your body will absorb the medicine without issue but anything not pushed into the vein will not make it into your blood stream to work so it will not be a problem but it will not help you either.  At least these are my experiences.  We are all different so you might find other advice more suitable to your needs.  Good luck. There was almost no scar tissue when I could get my hands on 27 gauge needles. Now that there are only 25 gauge needles, the scarring is becoming bad and hard. I jab at least thrice a week and do not always hit with the first jab. Hmm why cant u use smaller needles. I use grsy smaller ones instead of orange bigger ones Unavailable for sale.

I just did not understand at first because I used to take preventative prophylaxis, my levels are exactly 0%, and I injected every other day, so I never thought about minor bruises and bumps much cause I kept my levels high through constant injections. Hemlibra has changed the game though, and I never want to go back. I am with you. I was every other day prophy and hated it so much Ahhh, I can relate to this so much!

My wife used to make me accessory kits for my travels and to be cute we would call them CHO Pilots.  \n\nIn my mind that turned into the idea of a badass hamster that flies a plane.  A visually entertaining notion based on a pun that came to be a representation of the women in my life who helped me manage my disorder.  My wife, my mother, the nurses and doctors, it is been overwhelmingly women who have made up my support system and they have a voice that is uniquely understanding yet stern.  \n\nCall it wishful thinking but I am trying to reflect my super ego through that hamster in the form of things I might have internalized from my support systems.  \n\nThat is Penny for Your Clots.\n\nI would say that I consider this comic strip to be just as much about my relationship with routine as much as managing hemophilia has been a difficult part that. As for my formal release of the material I am considering my options for releasing issues.  I have a few more strips illustrated and am considering releasing them weekly either on a website/platform or through hemophilia newsletters.\n\nAt this point I am open to ideas for release if you or anyone else has them I really like this idea of illustrating the infusion process. This type of work could really help ease the anxiety for younger hemophiliacs, especially. I think you should consider publishing this and other similar work so that it could be distributed to kids dealing with our disease.

Thank you for your dedication to the community and for such a positive response!   \n\nI am working towards making more of these that take on a slice of life sort of vibe in an effort to make some content that feels honest to my experiences with the disorder.

Ultimately I want to help encourage people to express their feelings in a healthy way I was supposedly on prophy as a kid, but my parents gave me a lot of independence in doing my infusions and deciding what I could do physically once I was like 12. I was always terribly at sticking to the prophy schedule, and frequently would walk on a sprained ankle for a day before treating it. Even as late as this past year at the age of 28, I would put it off, and even when I infused on-time it would be at night when it was easiest to find some extra time, but least effective for preventative care.

Keeping the constant levels does wonders even if you do not reach the \u201chighs\u201d of factor. I have a desk job so it is a little different, but I am very active. I am able to work out multiple days in a row, play pick up sports, go skydiving regularly, go hiking, etc. all without thinking about bleeding.

Partially because I get irritated by jewelry so wearing it constantly means I no longer notice it being on, partially because I am forgetful. Mines a dog tag with 2 conditions, no asa, and that I respond to DDAVP. My dosage info and hematologist are on a card in my wallet I have been wanting to do this because I always lose or break bracelets! \n\nWhere exactly on your arm? I wanted to do just below my wrist but feel like that might be too obvious for an office job. Mines on the inside of my right forearm about 4-5 inches from my wrist. It is about the size of a softball. It is the medical sign with the snake in it. It has 2 red blood drops and on top it says Factor 7 Deficiency. The bottom says B+ Got a photo? Would like to see it. My only concern with a tattoo is that the medic would not actually pay attention to it. I wear a necklace. But its on a string. I always wore a necklace, but it was metal. Made my neck FILTHY. Kids almost made fun of me because my neck was always black. Was not until college I had the epiphany that my neck was dirty from the tarnish of the necklace. Switched to a string necklace and all is fine now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have medical ID stickers on my motorcycle helmet and my phone case. I have thought about doing this. How does it look? Just a little block of text? It is a decent size and really cool. Idk how to upload a picture in comments. I will post it in its own thread. Give me a few minutes..... I love their bracelets!  And they have a lifetime warrantee. We have bought 2 but both have been replaced a time or two. My daughter (age 7) has a platelet disorder. I wear a dog tag. Easily concealed under my clothes. Durable chain. Supposedly paramedics are trained to look for them. Better safe than sorry. I know here in the UK people are given a haemophilia ID card for their wallets, but they are just a tatty bit of green cardboard from what I recall. I ditched it ages ago and just stick with the metal dog tag. As a paramedic who is a bleeder , yes it is important to have something. Honestly tho I prefer to wear a bracelet on left wrist because that is the arm that will get checked first due to IV placement when unconscious.  We ( the other people I have worked around) rarely check a wallet until at the ER and they only check for a necklace when cutting a shirt off following a wreck. I look for stuff but that is just because I grew up around it.", "Growing up with Haemophilia A - Diaries of a Haemophiliac  I would love to hear about your experiences", "Colonoscopy with VWD type 1 Hi friends! This has been such a great subreddit as a resource as I have discovered by own VWD in the last couple years. Feel free to skip to the bold \"question\" later on.\n\n**Backstory:**\nI have long struggled with stomach issues since growing up and am currently scheduled to get a colonoscopy in the next few weeks to try and diagnose my problem. They suspect some form of ulcerative colitis or similar issue.\n\nI work with an awesome hematologist and have found a very knowledgeable GI specialist, who are both working closely together to make sure I am receiving proper treatment (DDAVP infusion prior to procedure, nasal spray afterwards). I feel very confident that they will take great care of me and prevent any major bleeding episodes, but it is hard to shake the first time I discovered my VWD during an operation in 2019 where I went to the ER 5 times due to bleeding (took them 2 months to diagnose).\n\n**Question:**\nHas anyone with VWD type 1 or similar had a colonoscopy done wherein they take a few biopsies? How did it go? Anything I have missed here regarding treatment? Thanks! :) One of my patients with VWD had a colonoscopy recently and she infused before hand with Humate-P , and then again after, and she was fine. She is in her 70\u2019s and in great shape. She was getting GI bleeds from eating raspberries. People with VWD should not eat raspberries. I would recommend using something stronger than DDAVP and Stimate, but I am not a doctor, I only work in healthcare. Usually colonoscopy\u2019s will not cause bleeding but if afterwards you feel like it has maybe look into Humate P. It has VWD factor as well as factor 8 and works well for VWD. It seems to be the new standard as far as I can tell. I dont intend for this to be medical advise, just telling you what I have seen done. Also 2 other patient of ours with VWD used humate P for surgery\u2019s recently and each went well. Just some ideas. I am sure you are in good hands and your doctors know what they are doing. But it is good to know what works for others too. Best of luck figuring out your bleeds. Wait I have VWD3 and have never heard the raspberry thing.... Why should not I eat them? same, I have vWD type 3 and I eat berries of all kinds as much as I can...Do not take raspberries away from me... I have type 3 and went for an endoscopy without notifying my care team, so I did not inject my meds, nor was I made aware they were taking biopsies. \n\nI bled a bit, had to wear a pad to keep from bleeding everywhere, but I took a large dose after I saw the bleeding and was fine after. Only lost a few tablespoons of blood all in all. I have hemophilia A and have had several colonoscopies.  I also have ulcerative colitis (hence all the scopes) diagnosed back in 2012 at age 14.  With hemophilia A, I use factor before and after, and amicar after.  Have you ever had a factor infusion?  Something to consider.   Good luck with your scope and feel free to DM me. I know raspberries are the best. Diverticulitis is what it is called. I might be wrong about raspberries causing it. But that is what they used to think. And I have seen people with VWD have problems when they eat them. But I am not sure if that was what caused the bleeding. Worth looking into tho. I have a platelet storage pool deficiency. My blood does not clot as easily as the average person. I do not know much about VWB, but I hope this helps. \n\nI had a colonoscopy and they needed to remove multiple hemorrhoids and polyps. There were zero issues related to my bleeding disorder. Prepping for the colonoscopy was hell, but other than that, it was a relatively pain and stress free experience. \n\nI hope yours goes well and you get some answers. \n\nGood luck and be well! \ud83d\udc9c Yeah. I love raspberries. Zero problems! 2A severe. Had cameras both up and down (I have ulcers at the base of my \u0153sophagus which were bleeding). Had factor replacement just in case - no problems afterwards (or since as now on lanzoprazole) I have VWD 2A and I had a benign cyst removed on my neck right by my carotid artery  with just DDAVP and was absolutely fine, I think for a colonoscopy you should be ok.  I have had to have Humate-P for my wisdom teeth removal and childbirth but my levels were worse at those times. I have VWD and treat with replacement factor on demand. I have had multiple colonoscopies with and without biopsies due to GI bleeding. I have had no problems as long as I pre-treat and follow my HTC\u2019s guidelines. Do not hesitate to reach out to you hematologist with any concerns. It sounds like you are doing all the right", "Anybody participated genome mapping? At my annual visit to the hemophiliac clinic (last month) the nurse asked me if I wanted to participate in a genome mapping program.  Apparently there is a group that wants to trace the gene breakdown/deficiency to pinpoint exactly what caused us to have hemophilia.  The way she explained it, the group offering the service covers the cost and keeps everything anonymous.  They just want to map our genes to find the problem to help with identifying/treating hemophilia and other issues in the future.  My nurse said the group is offering the service to all hemophiliacs (I assume in the US) and will share their findings with us in return for a vial of blood to play with.  Just curious is anybody has been offered or participated in this and received their results.  I am guessing the results will be a scientific collection of numbers and data that offer little to satisfy my unscientific mind.  Plus it is much more romantic to pretend we are all descendants of some royal family that had hemophilia in their bloodline but if it can help future generations I am willing to donate some blood.

Yeah I cannot get behind this. I like talking to people in the field but I feel there could atleast pretend to care about formality for research purposes. I am just going to start telling all these faux researchers that I miss the old days when hemophilia was an easy way score hookups with busty goth chicks because they thought I was a vampire. Law of averages says I will get into at least one academic paper sooner or later. I apologize if you perceived my post that way. I really am trying to learn more, so that our lab can better understand what kind of concerns that you have so that we can understand what is worth developing and what is not in terms of technology for helping hemophiliacs. I wanted it to be straight forward, perhaps because I was guided by others to put importance to brevity and simplicity, but I can definitely see how over the Internet this can be perceived as impersonal and dickish. Sorry about that.  It is not just about being perceived as \"impersonal and dickish\", it is about unethical conduct and lack of transparency. We have no idea if your research is toward the medical side or something more holistic, how any contributions would be presented, etc.\n\nIf you told your professors that you did your research by just going onto a random forum and asking people to *post in public* about their experiences, without any sort of procedures in place to protect anonymity or verify that they were not just 13 otters in a human suit, they would laugh you out of the lecture hall and tear up the degree you already have. Hemophiliacs rise up", " Stop The Bleeding! a comedy webseries about hemophilia by Patrick James Lynch  ", "Anyone else have wrist troubles? Does anyone here have any difficulties with their wrists or any advice on dealing with stiffness? I am a 23 y/o male with mild hemophilia A who over the past few years have developed some pretty rough stiffness in my right (dominate) wrist, especially when I lift weights or give it much strain. I currently take fish oil, and a glucosamine + chondroitin joint support vitamin but wondered if any of you all might have some other advice. Thanks Fish oil has a blood thinner component, in case you were not aware. No advice but my husband (type B, severe) is dealing with it now.  He does boxing with a heavy bag for cardio but is currently dealing with some wrist/forearm pain in his dominant hand as well. All he does is lay off any upper body work until it heals.  He is also using a wrist brace (just a cheap one from a pharmacy) and finds that helpful.  Glucosamine is something that my hematologist recommended I stop taking. Some of his patients reported more issues while taking it, and the studies indicating its benefits were not strong enough for the risks we have, in his words. In general, supplements for joint health usually are trying to do something we do not necessarily want to happen.\n\nI also have mild (7%) and started running into issues in my mid-20s after years of activity. Sometimes I would actually have a joint bleed and not know it, which seems unbelievable even to me, especially with my shoulder. It must have resolved on it is own quickly, but now my shoulder is arthritic. I did not know how to self-infuse then because honestly I rarely needed factor at that point in my life and often factor I had at home would expire. Eventually I would get a new hematologist who found it was arthritic and prescribed physical therapy, where I learned exercises to help strengthen and improve range of motion.\n\nI would say stop taking the supplements and probably hold off on exercises that exacerbate your wrist stiffness until you can talk to your hematology office. Maybe ask if you can get a visit or two in with a physical therapist who can help with wrist stuff. Once I found a physical therapist I trust, he became one of the most important people in my life, honestly. Exactly what I came here to say. Damn I did not know this. Thanks I am worried I am about to start having some of the same issues with my wrist if I am not careful. I am going to take your advice and try to get into contact with a good pt. It is sucks there is nothing else we can do really besides take an $8000 per dose medication It does suck, but on the other hand its pretty amazing too. If we were born 20 years earlier there is a good chance we would have hiv or hep, or be dead from those. If we were born 50 years ago there is a descent chance we would not have lived to see age 25 (more so for me as a severe than you as a mild, but still a decent chance if you had a big injury). A good PT is extremely valuable. I have seen mine for three issues in the last four years. Even though I am his first hemophiliac, he knows exactly how far to push me. In my area, a lot of adult hemophiliacs do not seem to have a go-to PT, and HTCs do not have a preferred therapist, even though the pediatric HTC had an in-house therapist. So you may want to ask a local advocacy chapter, too, if any members have recommendations. Chondroitin can act as a blood thinner.  Check with your HTC or doctor, but glucosamine solo should be OK. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) should be OK as well. Have you had your wrist examined by an orthopedic surgeon?  They can image it to check for joint damage from bleeds, as well as any issues that are non-hemophilia related. I have a TFCC tear in my right wrist that is completely non-hemophilia related. It is from my hematologist himself that told me about glucosamine but I agree that everyone should check before just about any supplement.", "Antibiotics and injections. I had been getting very good at poking the butterfly needle into the vein and had been close to getting a 100% hit rate, with thanks to a lot of advice here. Yesterday was an aberration. I was on antibiotics and it took 4 tries. Does antibiotics affect one's veins or reaction? Each of those needles went into the vein but did not work properly. There was backflow all the way to the syringe with each one but did not work once I began infusing. Also the blood was super dark looking. Just wondering if it was due to the antibiotics and if so next time I will infuse before taking antibiotics.

Rotate your venepuncture sites as often as you can in order to keep your favorite sites fresh for when you really need them. And relax. The more nervous you get stabbing your veins, the more difficult it becomes!\n\nOh, and one more piece of advice- when you learn to do your own treatment, you will then be responsible for remembering when your treatment is due. Take it when you should, and not when you can be stuffed self-infusing. It takes some people a long time to get comfortable with self-infusion.  Thanks for the feedback! &gt; Sure. Rotate your venepuncture sites as often as you can in order to keep your favorite sites fresh for when you really need them.\n\nCo-signed by the guy who used the same vein without issue for 15 years and had it suddenly die on him at a music festival. Think of it as wiping your own ass. That is how I approached it. Do not start panicking about the blood circulation if the veins do not pop up right away and give it a few minutes. Exciting stuff! Good luck! I am 29 and I still struggle to find courage to do it on a site different from my 3 usual sites :( cannot explain it  When I was 10 or 11 I went to a summer camp for hemophiliacs.  One evening a few of us began feeling the physical effects of the day and we all went to the nurses station for factor.  I was the youngest in the group and it just happened a nurse finished mixing my dose first and she asked if I wanted her to stick me or if I wanted to do it myself.  Of course I could not allow myself to be the \"baby\" of the group so in a shaky, nervous voice I said I would do it myself.  Of course I had never did it myself before that but peer pressure forced me to be the big boy.  (By the way none of the other guys stuck themselves that night)  I stuck myself on the first try and the rest is history.  (Not helpful but an entertaining story on how I punked myself into sticking myself)\n\nOf course I missed plenty of times since, but I learned how my body works and made adjustments.  I noticed being cold or dehydrated make things tougher for me, especially now that I am getting older (42).  If I have been laying around (usually because of pain related to the bleed I need to treat) and my circulation is lower/slower than normal it can be tough.  Taking a few minutes to walk around gets things moving again and helps out. A hot shower can do the same.  These are mostly tricks I used as I got older but I am sharing them to give you some ideas in case you have a tough time at some point.  Most of the time it will be smooth sailing.  You have watched it being done to you for your entire life so it will be second nature. After the first stick, it is all easy peasy.  Do rotate your IV sites and pay attention to the supplies you are sent.  My supplier started sending me 20 gauge needles instead of 25 gauge needles and even though the factor flows much faster through a 20 gauge because of the larger diameter, the larger diameter is also punching a larger hole in your vein and will take longer to heal and wear that area out faster.  And it is not a bad idea to get somebody you live with comfortable sticking you.  It is been very rare, but a couple of times I had very bad elbow bleeds which made it nearly impossible to stick myself.   Sorry for rambling, too much coffee this morning.  You will do fine.  Congratulations on the next step to self reliance.  Good luck.  90% of any problems are going to be psychological. Remember to stay calm and breathe steadily. This here, do not stress out about it too much. Most of the battle will be to keep yourself calm and not getting tense. Provided your veins are normal sized, it is actually very easy to self infuse. This might be common knowledge, but I place some tape on the butterfly before I stick the needle in. No one told me about taping the needle and i always struggled with sticking myself and then having the needle shift out of the vein when I depressed the syringe. Somethings that I always tell my pediatric patients when they start to self infuse:\n\nYou have three kinds of veins.  Veins that are so easy to hit that they practically inject themselves.  Veins that are typical, neither hard nor easy to get.  Veins that are really hard.  And then I roll up my sleeve and show them my hard veins, and my super easy \"CPR vein\"  The vein no one gets to use unless I need CPR.  The normal veins are easier to see after that.\n\nAnother thing:  Your pain fibers are like a pair of ladies opera gloves, the ones that start at her fingers and go to her elbows.  The mesh is really tight on her fingers, but more and more lacey as she gets to her elbows.  Look for veins in your arms rather than your hands, they will not hurt as much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce  you get your veins mapped out in your head, save the hard ones for the lab techs and the nurses, use the normal ones for regular use and the super easy ones for when you have an emergency bleed or are ill, or really tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you can self infuse, your bleeds will be easier to fix, because you will treat faster and you will have more independence as you will not have to have your parents do this for you.  Good luck! * Use a 27 gauge butterfly\n* Drink plenty of fluids beforehand.  Hot tea worked for me\n* Use a heat pack to help your veins really pop Did you like going to summer camp for hemophiliacs? There is one nearby and sounds like it would be a great experience for my kid when he is old enough.  I was not terribly excited about the idea when I was getting dropped off from what I remember but the experience was worth it.  Self infusing was a big takeaway obviously but until then I had not met any other hemophiliacs except for the kids I saw at my annual hemophilia clinic visit.  It was a learning experience because other kids my age were sharing ways they dealt with things only hemophiliacs would understand. Personally, I think it would be good for him to go to camp.  Have you started self injecting yet? If so how did it go? Its a piece of cake! Learned how to do it at 13 and had my porticath removed then as well. If you dont have prominent veins you, you just have to get used to how a vein feels, bouncy. Palpate, measure twice, cut once. I go up and down my veins like a ladder, as well as switch up which ones im using. Also use the veins on top of my hands every once in a while.\n\nIm a phlebotomist for a living and have a lot of experience with even the most difficult of veins.

(Heamophilia A &gt;1% level) Damned telemarketers! I mean... I watched my mother work menial jobs for my entire childhood, just to be able to cover my factor 8 under her policies. My roommates are shocked when I ask them to not put their leftovers on top of my 75k stash of factor.\nThe only real perspective I get on how unbelievably expensive our medicines are happen to be from other people. \nI still remember how twisted my young head got the first time someone in the community suggested to me that there would be a cure long ago, if only it were not financial suicide for the companies producing our factors. \nThis makes me feel hopeful for the little ones, though. Very lucky! Meanwhile I pay hundreds of dollars a month so that I have the privilege to pay thousands of dollars if I ever need treatment. \\*sigh\\* What percent level is your maximum? Yeah in the US its all profit-based... Do you have to pay your treatment yourself? Just to be clear, this article is about the cost of gene therapy in the US once it has been approved by regulators.  Patients in the US are able to participate in clinical trial studies for free.  Most studies pay a per diem and travel expenses.\n\nHow does the healthcare system in Germany handle expensive drugs once they have been approved by regulators? It depends on the Therapy. If you have certain health insurances they will give you free therapys if your disease is very rare (&gt;a certain populus .\n\n\nIn my case with severe Haemophilia Type A under 1% level the goverment subsidises and the insurance pays for my medications without premium. Sounds great.  Do you expect the same to be true once gene therapy has exited the trial stage? I pay my copay annually, which is over $2k, so I can get my meds. Gene therapy on top of that would no doubt be a separate cost that I could not afford. Have you investigated drug manufacturer patient assistance programs?  There may also be help available from Patient Services Inc. and Patient Access Network for co-pays and premiums. Yes they expect the trial in q1 next year to be free and they expect if good results come in these meds will be free of charge or subsidized by gov I used to qualify for this, but now that I am married our combined income puts us just over the income threshold to qualify. Unfortunately, we live in Washington State and cost of living is extremely high so money does not go as far as it might elsewhere. The additional $2k each year has been a huge financial stressor tbh. You may want to check the manufacturer program again.  For instance, Eloctate's program has no income requirements. Good point actually. I use Xyntha and had used the Pfiezer program in the past, had not looked into it this year but maybe it is changed. Good call! Looks like ( has no income requirement either.  Just saying... Good article in some respects like cost, but very misleading in others. This makes it seem like some people expect the current gene therapies to be a lifelong cure. Essentially NO ONE thinks that about the current state of the treatment. The pharma companies know that, the researchers know that, so why is this article pushing the whole \u201clifelong cure\u201d thing like it is even a question at the moment?\n\nSure the next generation of gene therapies may be more promising and may truly be lifelong cures, but as an \u201colder\u201d hemophiliac, this situation reeks of pharmaceutical companies making another money grab on hemophilia patients.

I have Type 1 VWD, and just found out that I will most likely need to have my wisdom teeth removed. I have a consultation with the oral surgeon later this week. Two of them are fully grown with roots, and the other two are still coming in but have started to form roots. They are all coming in straight and I do have the room in the back of my mouth for them, so they were left alone. But now I have a cavity on one of the two fully grown ones that the dentist cannot reach because the inside of my cheek gets in the way (hence why the cavity formed in the first place; I cannot get back there with a toothbrush). Anyways, since I have a lot of gum bleeding with just brushing and flossing, I am expecting to need DDAVP with the extraction of these, and I also have accepted the possibility of a hospital stay to control bleeding. I was told by the oral surgeon's office that it would be submitted to my dental insurance and would not go to my health insurance at all.  However, I have no idea whether or not the dental would cover this. Has anyone else had any issues with DDAVP or other clotting factor being covered under dental insurance? Were you able to submit it (and any resulting hospital stays) to dental only, and get covered for it, even partially?  \n\nOh, and any tips/recommendations you can provide in general about having this done would be really helpful too.  I did call my hematologist to inform them already, but I am nervous as I have never had to have surgery before.  Thanks!

I somtimes tape it after putting it in at a very low angle of attack. Almost parrelel to skin and that has like a 70% success rate which i think is bad. What do yall do. Also the injection that last 24 hours I will post a picture here in a few days when it is time for my prophylaxis. Ok It sounds like you have it right. \n\nmake sure you use a tourniquet \n\nfind a good vein that will be reliable. i would often use the same few veins and rotate. \n\nAnd, try different spots. For me, its easier to hit a vein in my hand because the ones in my elbows roll a lot. \n\nIf still having issues, ask your treatment center for guidance! Drink some water too it helps with getting access to the vains I just exercise and drink a lot of water to get a good vein I got good veins. Its just it seems like randomly when its taped it just somtimes like  exits the vein out of nowere When I inject and hear a pop in the vein that is where I push all the way thru until the blood shows in the butterfly tube No its in the vein. But halfway through it just randomly comes out somtimes Have u inject on the same spot a lot of times? When mine does not work on that vein I just find another part either left or right arm, sometimes in the forearm it has good big veins. I seitch between 2 forearm veins I have four good veins on the inside of my elbow joint that I use in sequence. I apply a tourniquet suitable for one-handed use.  Fairly low angle and once it is in the vein, I slide the needle up the vein a little more. I very rarely miss or tissue the vein. I make sure the butterfly needle tubing is all untangled beforehand so I do not need to tape it down during infusion. I have to make sure my nose is out of the way when I release the tourniquet as it pings off with some speed! Do you put the full needle inside your arm. Cause what i do is put like 60% of it in No, I would say around 50% of the needle. Maybe 60%, I am due some factor today, so I will need to check. I also use the smallest needles the hospital has. I theorize it does less damage to my veins. There pretty thin and long enough to get to the vein  I use the \"blue\" butterfly needles which are pretty small as I have seen the hospital using \"green\" ones which are larger. If they use those on me, I usually end up with a bruised arm and unable to use the vein for a couple of weeks. Bro I do not think 70% is good. I cannot tell you what you are doing wrong but if you have not been trained well you can always go to hemophilia care and they should be able to teach you on a  Mannequin hand. \n\nI do not do intervenes anymore cause I switched to hemlibra, but my success rate was over 90%. The blue kawasumis are 25 gauge. There are orange terumo butterfly\u2019s that are 25g also. I started using the terumo 27g scalp vein butterfly\u2019s a while back, they are grey, they work great and seem to do less damage. I have a few orange ones too (not sure of the brands). They look smaller but I have not used any. I get the feeling that the colours seem to be fairly standard across the brands (and possibly the world). 1. tourniquet\n2. Find a vein\n3. Alcolhol swab\n4. butterfly needle like landing an airplane (parallel like you said)\n5. push it in\n6. take the needle out\n7. band aid on\n8. hold pressure\n9. done The pop feeling is so satisfying to me Nonono i mean like the actual needle itself. Like what angle do you put it in. How much do you put it in. Stuff like that cause i get it in the vein but it randomly comes out in the middle of me doing the process I usually put it in at a low angle, like you are landing an airplane. And you should put it in enough that it does not slip out. Here are some of my tips: \n\nIf you think of a vein, it is a tube so pushing it further into your arm like it is traveling through the vein, if that makes sense.\n\nYou can try to stabilize the needle using your thumb, or other fingers.\n\nAlso maybe do not push as hard when injecting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsually, something like this would be good.\n\n( Ya that is what i use Here ya go. I infuse around every 4 days. If you have to do it more frequently, you can use the same spot on your other hand to give your veins some rest.  Ty I would always likened it to landing a plane. I would probably insert the needle at a 30-45 degree angle and once in the vein I would sort of level it out. I would usually have the needle itself about half way in. Always felt more secure that way and I would never needed to use tape to hold it in place.   \n\n\nAlso, not sure how many people do it this way (varies between how they were taught at their centre) but I would put the needle in before attaching this syringe. This made me feel like I had more manoeuvrability. Once I would landed, I would then grab the end fo the butterfly tube between the fingers of hand my arm had the needle in, remove the cap, attach the syringe and draw back. I know others prime the butterfly tube first and have the syringe attached from the get go. This way always felt strange to me, but I always so more guys doing it this way. One thing I did notice is every guy did seem to have very small or subtle variations in \"style\" and technique. We are taught a way to do it but over time I think we all develop a particularly method that suits us best. Is your tube that the blood goes through long enough to get from needle to syringe like from were the needle is( in your arm) to the syring (in your hand) if so, mine cant do that cause i got these small butterfyl needles that have the tube but its not long enough to hold the syring in my hand while i inject. That Is the biggest reason i have trouble doing it alone. I gota use tape or pray the needle doesnt rotate if i let go of it when its in I get my blood pressure up because it is typically low, and I go with a low angle like you said and pretty much have a feel for when I get the vein, tape it in place, then a little flush to get things moving, factor then a few ccs of flush after.", "Ran out of medication and do not have access to it right now. my earlobe piercings will not stop bleeding.

I am a 36-year-old hemophiliac from China. Recently, I have been thinking about moving to another country to study or work, but I am not familiar with the local policies of hemophilia treatment towards foreigners. The only country that I know of is Japan, where nonresidents with student visa or work visa are covered by the National Health Insurance so that they have access to various treatments free of charge. That is wonderful! But I am wondering if any other countries have such a friendly environment for foreign hemophiliacs to stay. My major focuses now include but not limited to: the U.K, Ireland and other EU countries. Thanks for telling me. Countries with Universal Health Care would be our best bet. Luckily Countries like UK, Germany, Sweden require any resident living in the country a mandatory Health insurance which in most cases will provide you with factors if you opt out for the Public health insurance as they seem to cover most medicines.\n\nDont quote me on this though, I am on the same boat and trying to leave to Europe from your neighbour country, Nepal :) Thanks pal\uff01What do you know about Ireland? It is growing on me, though I am still not sure about what is going on there. Well, i dont know much about Ireland so cant comment on it much but I think if the country has universal Healthcare like UK or Germany you might be intitled to your medicine since you would have paid for it. Other than this, i am afraid I will be of no help.\n\nBtw you seem to know about Japan and its response to foreign Hemophilics. Can you illustrate your knowledge a bit more? I would love to know about it. That is ok. I will be looking into it. About Japan, here is what I got from an American hemophiliac who has been living there for over 14 years, so his words should be highly reliable. I quote, \n\n\u201cAfter you get here you sign up for NHI, which your school would help you do I assume, you need two more certificates - the \u56fd\u6c11\u5065\u5eb7\u4fdd\u967a\u7279\u5b9a\u75be\u75c5\u7642\u990a\u53d7\u7642\u8a3c (which reduces the amount you pay for medication to \u00a510,000) and the \u533b\u7642\u5238 (which reduces it to \u00a50). Your hospital needs to fill out those forms.\n\nDepending on where you live, you should be eligible for an additional stipend from your municipality, but it varies from place to place. My old city it was \u00a510,000/month, now it is \u00a55,000.\u201d As u/Ididmytime2246 already mentioned, if you are able to secure a job in any of EU countries like Germany/Netherlands/France then you would be entitled to acquiring public health insurance which will cover the cost of your factor for sure.\n\nI have always been quite curious about how does the treatment work for the people currently in China. Could you possibly also shed a bit of light on that? In EU its different in every counrty i guess, because I know some people who went to Germany on student visa but still are getting the medications they need. Even my own doctor advised me to make a move to England after high school which i didnt and it turned out to be a dumb decision looking retrsopectively.\n\nI cant comment about China\u2019s policy, as I am from Nepal and have never set a foot on chinese soil, but i can shed some light about India and Nepal. Indian and Nepalese hemophilics are in a dire situation more so Nepal nowadays. We are totally reliant on the donations from Europe or the USA up until pandemic hit us, and sadly some of us lost our lives this year. India i belive buys enough factor to not let its hemophilics bleed out unlike Nepal. Some 6 years back, i went and did surgery on CMC hospital in south part of India and they had to fly the factors from Delhi to the hospital, even though that was a big hospital for hemophilia center (big enough to have hemophilics from Bangladesh, sri lanka and Maldives visit for severe complications).\n\nGetting back to Nepal, i think the company that has manufactured Hemlibra is about to donate some Hemlibra for the kids and Inhibitors patients. And Nepal or India has no policy to have Hemophilics included in any kind of Insurance policy too, so we cant even pay for the insurance even if we could afford. So there is no literal way for us to get factors other than to be reliant upon the government and hope that no shady politicians take our factors away.\n\nThe only country in Asia to have adequate amount of factors is Japan from what I have heard, as even Chinese people are dissatisfied with the amount of treatment they have gotten. Haha, i found you on this sub and you gave me some info too. Thanks for helping the community, it actually means a lot to us However, I am planning to study in Ireland next year. So, my major concern is if my treatment including factor or Hemlibra will be fully covered as well given my identity as a foreign student.\n\nIn respect to the status quo of hemophilia treatment in China, it varies dramatically from place to place. As we all know, China is a huge country,so it is not difficult to imagine there is a giant gap in all the aspects of social development in different areas. Patients around the country are not covered by a unified socical security system, therefore the medical conditions are subject to where they live. For example, patients from big cities or regions of well-developed economy are able to access to factor and other treatment at a low or no cost, while others living in poorly developed areas have to suffer from a miserable life in many ways. I am guessing u/jaygen97 or u/TheClotThickens might have an answer to how the treatment would work for expats in Ireland. So, despite my half Irish heritage I am UK based. I know some friends from Europe who relocated to Ireland. I think they brought significant supplies of their treatment with them though as they were relocating for studying. I would reach out to the Irish Haemophilia Society for more information. They are one of the best patient groups out there and I am sure they could advice on the treatment situation for you.  Yeah, I am not entirely sure myself to be honest, I think the clot thickens is right though.

Hi guys, I am a severe A type and 25 years old. I have had 3 ankle surgeries (target, the latest being 5years ago) and my problems keep getting worse. I am unable to work, unable to get disability, and now it is gotten so bad that my doctor is recommending that I get it fused, at least. He said that it is one of the worst joints he is seen in his 40 years. He also has said that if he gets in there and it is worse than he can see on the xrays and such, that I may have to lose my leg. Is there anyone who has dealt with things like this? Kind Of scared/anxious/nervous about it. I go Tuesday to see him again for more tests and to schedule the surgery. I am really sorry to hear you are going through this man. I can understand the reservation on your appointment tuesday. As someone who has Mild A, I cannot even imagine having to deal with that. I truly wish I had some helpful advice but all I can say is try to stay positive, brother. Get a second third and fourth opinion. Just because a doctor says it does not mean it is true. My brother (severe a) had two terrible ankles and got both replaced at the same time (cadaver ankle replacements) 1st double replacement ever, let alone on a hemophiliac. He made a full recovery. Needless to say he was as tough as they come (died of a heart attack a few years back) , but after he fully recovered (3 years , but hey) he was doing better than he had ever been. Point being , there are other options beyond ankle fusion and surely amputation. I do get it tho, it might be the easiest option to amputate. Who knows. My brother lived in alaska and went to San Diego to get his surgery, and alaska insurance (Medicare, or Medicaid?) paid for it, I am not sure how that went down. Again, point being anything is possible. Keep trying to find the best option. Talk to whatever connections , HTC, doctors, whoever you can. Try not to despair or settle until you feel comfortable with what you are doing. Things can seem bad at times but our bodies have an incredible ability to heal. I am 45 , severe a, and was told I needed an ankle fusion in my 20\u2019s. I never did it and it eventually got better (because I got a staff infection in it and needed and emergency orthoscopic surgery to squirt the infection out and the dr ended up squirting out some bone floaters and fixed my ankle). It has not hurt in 10 years. Lucky, I know, the dr said I could have lost my foot and was surprised I had recovered at all. (After 6 months of sitting still). Keep looking for the right people to help you. You never know what will happen. I strongly recommend talking to a new doctor. And keep trying until you find an approach you trust. Hey, I hope everything works out for you. This all probably seems pretty terrible, but I hope my personal experience can give you some light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nSpeaking as someone who is had both ankles fused, I have to tell you that it was the best thing that is ever happened to me. I have been pain-free and bleed-free since I had them both fused. I am also far more mobile than I ever was before. \n\nI now work full time and i am nowhere as depressed as I used to be. I am sorry you have to go through all this brother. I would say do not just believe in one doctor, because throughout my hemophilic journey I have seen that every doctor has a different opinion. So try talking to another professional. I am sure your joint is quite messed up with the way you are describing, but do not worry. Have faith. The last option for us is to get replacement surgery which always works. Once you get the surgery, start with physiotherapy for your ankle, you need to rest the joint a lot as well. This kind of condition arises when bleeds are continuous. Around when I was 6-7 my knee had similar issues, and living in a country like India, the doctors were not too smart. That lead to my left leg to become so weak that now it looks like piece of bones (super skinny). Exactly same happened with my right knee. I developed deformity in both of them and lost my ability to walk for 8 years. I remember doctors recommending me a wheelchair for lifetime and explaining how it is the only option left for me now. Glad to inform you that I can walk again. I still have noticeable deformity in both but at least I do not have to be dependent on anyone anymore. All this happened without surgery and only exercise. Which in your case, you can fix it with surgery. Do not be afraid man, just get joint replacement. Do physiotherapy, twice a day. Get the strength back. \n\nI hope everything works out for you brother, if you need someone to talk to just PM me, take care! What country are you in?  What product are you currently using and do you treat on-demand or prophy? Very sorry to hear about your condition. \n\nPlease check with doctors other than an orthopedician. Check with Musculoskeletal and PM&amp;R ( physical medicine &amp; rehabilitation) specialists. \n\nEven the worst diagnosis has some hope. Maybe not 100% recovery, but check if something is possible to avoid the surgery. Who is your doctor, as in haematologist or bone specialist? The latter are useless. I saw one more than 20 over years ago and he wanted to fuse my ankle. I told him to  off. Today I have no problems. The main changes were going on prophylaxis, starting an exercise regime that was not directed by physiotherapists (another group of healthcare practitioners who give extremely useless advice from my experience) among other things. As the old saying goes, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Hi, had not stopped by this sub in a while and I saw your post. Hope things are better. Here is what I have experienced(moderate factor viii deficiency, a neg):\n\nI had chronic ankle problems all along the way. Fusion was brought up as a topic in my teens. I categorically refused and limped along. Ointments, bandages, RICE, PT, canes, sitting out countless events, lots of unhappiness and negative self-talk; the whole deal. \n\nFinally, at 44 I was bone-on-bone. The nurse I trust most at the htc said \u201cI know the surgeon you want. You want the cutter who does fusions every week since forever. I have got just they guy.\u201d\n\nWhen I met the surgeon, we talked about the possibility of losing my leg below the knee. It is a standard part of the pre-surgery consult conversation because it is a risk of that type of surgery. I stated that I was so completely over ankle pain and ankle problems that I was ok if that was our outcome. I just wanted the pain to stop. \n\nSo, a few weeks later I limp down the hallway to the OR and get on the table. The next six weeks were hard, but as the fused talar and subtalar joints healed the pain went away. I did PT and a ton of pilates to learn a different way to walk and move, and it was GREAT! The pain was gone. \n\nPost-surgery &amp; post-recovery, what I realized was that I would sacrificed the opportunity to be rid of the pain and isolation by being so damn stubborn. I should have had the operation at least five years earlier, and could have had a radically different 30\u2019s &amp; 40\u2019s if I would done it ten years earlier. \n\ntl;dr If a care provider talks about fusion, they are responding to your apparent pain and discomfort. Listen to their advice. Get the surgery.

I am not familiar with facebook hemophilia groups. Guess maybe that is a blessing. It is actually opposite for me. I cannot find a hemophilia subreddit in my language, but i can find it on facebook. No offence, but news regarding the danish situation is more important to me than world (mostly america). Start a Danish haemophilia subreddit! I generally avoid the facebook groups due to astounding stuff a lot of parents post...they have time to take pictures of their kids head injuries and are asking \"what should I do?\"... :/ In fairness, there are a lot of parents on those groups who are completely overwhelmed by the child's condition and care providers often are not crazy familiar with the condition, so parents just want to know they are reacting appropriately to the child's injury and they have no other frame of reference when their doctor tells them it is nothing to worry about but it looks way more serious. r/hemophilia is like hemophilia after dark. Luckily reddit does not have hysterical parents and the anon or semi-anon part can help as well. There is a talkshop hemophilia page that has a bunch of moms answering questions usually instead of actual hemos. I tried to answer questions as often as they came up. Got into it with an overprotective and over reaching mother about something ridiculous. I do not even remember what it was about. I feel so bad for the kids of those mothers. They are not allowed to do anything it definitely feel that despite the advances in treatment, parents are getting more protective over their kids. That is why I am always encouraging them to send them to camps. I am familiar with the talkshow page. They were kind enough ask if they could share my video. Closer inspection of their about section reveals that the page is actually managed by a healthcare market research company so it is less of a closed community group/page. They have got 26k likes but their posts seldom get more than a couple of engagements. Facebook is weird...but I am sort of in too deep at this point haha! hahah I like that analogy! Agreed. For all anyone here knows, I could be Batman. :/ every parent should know that if its a head injury...even if in doubt, call the centre or on call team. Baffles me they somehow find time to take pictures, upload them to facebook and ask what they should do...it is either a really poor understanding on their part or complete lack of education from the haemophilia team...probably a combination of both Proud to have gotten banned from one of the more rabidly mom-centric groups... oh wait they are all rabidly mom-centric.

We both need FVIII so I do not get it.  The difference is which protein your body does not produce/produces a non functional version of. For hemophilia A, you do not make factor 8, while for VWD (for some patients at least) you are of course missing von Wilde brands factor. Those with hemophilia A can take replacement factor 8 and already have the VWD factor to complement it, so they are good to clot at that point. Those with VWD do not have that protein, but because VWD and factor 8 travel in the blood together and VWD prevents the factor 8 from being metabolized, they also lack factor 8, as they do not have the VWD to protect it. Thus, it is best to take VWD and factor 8 together to have all the required clotting factor . Wow \n\nSo smart\n\nThank you This was taken from a newsletter I receive in Canada:\n\nVon Willebrand Disease: What makes it different from Hemophilia?\r  \nDr. Sara Israels,  MD FRCPC\r  \n\r  \nVon Willebrand Disease (VWD), the bleeding disorder with the unusual name, is much more common than hemophilia. However, unlike hemophilia, where men are affected far more frequently than women, the chance of inheriting VWD is the same for men and  women. BUT, women and girls are more likely to have bleeding problems because VWD can cause heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding after childbirth.\r  \n \r  \nVWD is named after Erik von Willebrand, a Finnish doctor who was the first to recognize that VWD was not hemophilia (he called it hereditary pseudo-hemophilia in 1926). It took another 50 years for us to understand what von Willebrand factor (VWF) does and how to measure it in the laboratory.\r  \n \r  \nHere are some other differences between hemophilia and VWD:\n\n\r  \nVWF is a very large protein that circulates in the blood and helps to stop bleeding by acting as the glue that sticks platelets together so that they can plug the hole in a damaged blood vessel. Clotting factors VIII and IX, which are low in hemophilia A and B, come along later in the process to form a mesh over the plug and keep the blood clot stable until the damage can heal.\r  \nPeople with hemophilia are more likely to have deep bleeding in muscles and joints.  People with VWD are more likely to have bruises, nosebleeds, and heavy menstrual bleeding. BUT, this is not an absolute: anyone with a bleeding disorder can bleed from any site, given the right circumstances.\r  \nMaking a diagnosis of hemophilia takes one blood test. Making a diagnosis of VWD takes several tests: one to measure the level of VWF, one to measure whether it is working properly, and one to measure its size. These tests are not simple. That is why people are sometimes asked to come back for a second or even a third round of testing, to sort things out.\r  \nVWF levels can be affected by many things including age, hormones, pregnancy and medications. So, someone is VWF can vary over time depending on what else is happening to them. This is much less of an issue for clotting factors VIII and IX, in hemophilia. &gt; Dr. Sara Israels\n\nHey, that was my doctor when I was a kid!! Small world. (me too) Von Willebrand disease: A Hemophilia-like bleeding disorder where a part of the factor VIII is diminished. Von Willebrand disease is similar to hemophilia but does not have the same name as it is more common, usually does not cause bleeding in the joints, and is normally milder than hemophilia.is called Von Willebrand disease.\n\nHemophilia A is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII; most common Hemophilia as about 85% of patients have type A. Von Willebrand disease is a hemophilia-like bleeding disorder where a part of the factor VIII is diminished. Von Willebrand disease is similar to hemophilia but does not have the same name as it is more common, usually does not cause bleeding in the joints, and is normally milder than hemophilia.

Have you told your employer about your condition? My first employer out of high school knew. It was a strenuous job, very physical and it was a great idea to tell them because my boss let me store factor in his office.\n\nMy current employer does not know. In my state (I dont knownif it varies by state) youre not required to disclose disability/medical information UNLESS you need accommodation. There are people I work with who are aware of my bleeding disorder just in case I get hurt and cannot inform others, they can. \n\nDo not EVER think you cannot refuse a task or job because its too unsafe for you or because you have a bleed. Well I recently had to leave one because I was suffering from brain/mental fog and on top of that got a bleeding episode. \nI had not told boss about the bleeds, he was annoyed I was delaying the task and said I had not other option for me. When I worked events I tried to really keep pace with the other stage hands and sometimes I would suffer for it.  Rarely on bleed form but sometimes hard to tell yknow? I am a self employed musician. I have always pushed my self way too much. From dragging my drums up and down multiple flights of stairs on bad ankles and knees, to not doing my prophylaxis because I did not want  to explain to other musicians what I am doing.\n\nI never wanted to do an office job although it was recommended for me to do something less physical. I had a knee replacement at 26 and I am in desperate need of an ankle fusion now at 34.\n\nI do not regret my career choice but it is definitely taken it is toll on my body. I have not been able to play drums in the past 6 months because of complications with gene therapy and my ankle issues (plus Covid has not helped) so who knows what the future holds. I have always told my employers, usually within the first few weeks or so.  I have never had a negative response.  I had one employer thank me for letting them know \"so if I became unconscious they could call an ambulance\".  I replied that I would hope if any employee became unconscious they would call an ambulance, not just fo me.\n\nI have been lucky that I work in the healthcare industry so most of my employers actually see my Hemophilia as a plus that gives me a unique perspective.  I also do not do anything really physical and as covid as shown can do my work from home. So outside of surgeries and a few bad bleeds nothing has impacted my work to much. \n\nHaving said all that I still have pushed myself more than i should.  Waiting to get home at the end of the day to treat for bleed.  Going into work when I should have stayed in bed and kept weight of my ankle, etc.  But I never did these things for my employer, I did them for myself. I hated feeling like I have let others down bc of my Hemophilia.  I always wanted to be seen as fully capable.  But these are my internal feelings as everyone as always been very accommodating. \n\nAs I have gotten older I wish maybe I had taken a little better care of myself.  I have always had a hard time asking other people for help, never wanting to appear \"different\".  I always felt that I could power through it and ignore the pain. The problem was once the pain started to be all the time, I could no longer ignore it.  It is one of the reasons I ended up dropping down to part-time, one of my employers accommodations.\n\nI think I have been pretty fortunate.  My parents always pushed schooling bc they knew I wouldnt be able to handle physical labour.  I was fortunate that my parents could help financially with post secondary education.  They understood that alot of part time and summers jobs were closed off to me because my joints were already wrecked by then. Even now I am fortunate to live in a country where my factor is payed for by the government so I do not have to worry about  the financial cost. Software engineer. My employer knows but I do not think sitting in front of a computer more is hurting my joints. I am a software engineering too. \nMy bleeding joint is left knee. \nI could not sit on a chair for too long. Thank you for sharing your experience sir. :) Ah, my problem joints are my right elbow (with daily celebrex is not an issue) and my ankle which is fused so no longer an issue.

He told me this would be necessary to make sure that there are no remains of meds left in the milk. \nBut after birth my period will return. Before I got pregnant I used to take tranexamic acid about 6-7 days to stop the bleeding. If I have to pump down every time I take meds, the breastfeeding will stop monthly for 10 days???

He has always had a positive attitude on the trials life has put him through, which is something that I admire deeply about him. He has been dealing with several different injuries over the past year, and it seems to knock him down a little more each time. Right now he is trying to get results on whether or not he has sclerosis of the hips or RA, which has been terrifying to him and I because he is only 23 years old, and these seem to be pretty scary diagnoses for a very active 23 year old to get. \n\nI guess what I am really asking is what are some things I can do in support of him and his disorder or what are some things that your own s/o does for you that has lightened the emotional burden for you? \n\nAlso to the significant others what are some things you find helpful in relieving your own emotional burden? \n\nI love my fianc\u00e9 very much, any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Just letting someone know you will be there no matter what could greatly alleviate their depression. One of my biggest concerns is that my hemophilia will cause social struggles later in life and having someone who you know will love you unconditionally could greatly alleviate any stress. I am pretty sure most hemophiliacs are prepared for their body to deteriorate later in life and it is just about finding things you can do and adjusting. The trials we have been through have made us pretty equipped at handling diversity.  I think it is dependent on what type of person he is. Me personally, when I was going through a phase of depression  around that age (27 now) I came on here and wrote out a big rant. I did not really need support from my friends, family, or GF, I just needed to worm through it my own way.\n\nI used to be very active, lifting 5 or 6 times a week and then Hemophilia so screw you, you are elbows no longer work, no more lifting for you. I just had to accept the fact that it was not going to happen anymore and move on. \n\nHes probably got a lot going through his head right now and he may just need you to be there if and when he needs it. I am sure he knows you are there for him and as long as you have a good relationship, which is sounds like you do.\n\nOne thing that always pissed me off when I was depressed about my hemophilia, was some one offering to do something for me BECAUSE of the Hemophilia. Just do not treat him as a Hemophiliac, treat him as your friend who is got some shit going on his head and he needs to work through and you are there for him when he needs it.\n\nThis is all personal stuff from my own experiences though, it may not be the same for him. I hope at least some portion of my rambling can help you in some way or another Sounds like you are an incredible partner. \n\nJust be there for him.  I find the best medicine/pain killer is a great conversation with a close friend.   Reading about this is making me so concerned for my 5 year old son with severe hemophilia a... fuck, I had no idea.  I would not be concerned I just voiced my opinions about one or my concerns later in life. I am 33 Andy I have led a more than normal life and with todays modern Medicine, degenerative arthritis is so much more less prominent. Trust me your son will lead a perfect life  It is heart warming to see this here. All the best for you guys ! I feel you, honey! My boyfriend (and probably husband soon) also has severe Hemophilia B, and we have the excellent fortune of living in a developing country. He is lucky that he is active in the local hemophilia community (he was their delegate to the WFH World Congress last year). People here rely mainly on donated factor concentrates that are often expired when they get here. There are times when I feel like giving up, and when I myself feel limited by his illness. I have resigned to the thought that I might not be able to do many of the things that I used to be able to do, or would be able to do if I were with someone else. But that is okay. I have to remind myself that I am with him for a reason -- that I chose him. Sometimes, the illness and its consequences may feel like a prison, but reminding myself that I had a choice (and I chose based on what I thought was best, every step of the way) is empowering.\n\nRecently, my boyfriend had an accident, causing him to get 17 stitches in his lip. His tooth also got pushed back into his skull. His tooth is now in a splint of sorts that he needs to keep on for 6 months. 6 months. He cannot eat properly til then. The thoughts in his head are sometimes terrible, and at times I honestly cannot bear to hear them. In his frustration he blames people, including me. I know he is just frustrated. It is either a blessing or curse that I \"get\" that, having some undiagnosed mental illnesses myself.\n\nIn times like these, I guess you really have to be the \"stronger\" one. What I do love about my boyfriend is his reflectiveness -- he gets angry, but once he processes these feelings, he is able to put things back in perspective (better than anyone else). He is also very supportive of me emotionally. He comforts me whenever I feel down, and during my bouts of low self-esteem.\n\nHe also has epilepsy (due to brain trauma he experienced as a child), so he has had trouble with emotional (and mental) stability. His parents have said that he was a very different person prior to epilepsy -- much more social and outgoing, funny (he still is, but his sense of humor is now pretty sarcastic), and positive. Hemophilia actually does not trouble him (or his family) as much as his epilepsy has for several years now.\n\nUsually when I feel deeply burdened I engross myself in my passions. Lately I have been wanting to explore and travel, but of course I cannot really do that since it is not ideal for my boyfriend. He is pretty introverted too, a homebody. So I make do with the occasional trip out of the house. We actually had a conversation earlier about going out vs. staying in (he is been stressed lately and wanting to just stay home and explore his passions, like learning to play the piano; whereas I want to go out and work). I have told him not to feel obligated to come with me when I feel like going out, but he insists. It is just in his personality.\n\nSo sorry to be rambling here. That is just how it is for me and my boyfriend. I do love him very much and want the very best for him. I guess what I can advise you is to hang in there and keep yourself steady -- there should be no hesitations there, if you love him. It is okay to have doubts (about your choice) sometimes especially when you feel tired, for as long as you have never second-guessed what you truly feel deep down. Keep learning about his treatments, about what you can do in case of emergency. Stay active in the community, and if he is close to his family, stay close as well. I suggest that you also keep friends (and your own family) close by should you ever need help that your partner will physically be unable to give. I personally fear that my boyfriend will not be able to take me to the hospital by himself if I get sick or need to give birth so we are going to need other people to help us. Hemophilia is going to be a lifelong struggle, so accept it (along with all the challenges that may lie ahead).", "Anyone in England that might be interested in this?... ", "I have VWD Type 1. Daughter's hematologist says she is VWD Type 2? First, hi everyone! I probably will not be much of a regular because VWD does not really affect me or my family much at this stage in our lives.\n\n\nAs title states, I have been diagnosed with Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease, which has been verified via multimer testing 3 times over the past 10 years (each new health system likes to recreate the diagnosis). \n\n\nMy daughter, who was 2 when tested, had an abnormal multimer result. My wife does not have VWD, and no one in her family tree shows any symptoms of the disease. How can my daughter *not* be Type 1 when I am?\n\n\nMy daughter's hematologist does not seem to be bothered by this, but my hematologist and I are baffled. What am I missing? Does the vWF protein change as we age, kind of like how our hemoglobin shifts proteins after birth?\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read! I have got hemophilia and not vWD so I am not as informed on it, but I thought multimer count was not the method for diagnosing Type 2 since the subtypes can sometimes return normal multimer levels? I could definitely be wrong about this, I admit.\n\nType 2 can be inherited as a homozygous recessive trait, but it seems like literature says more often than not it is not inherited this way. If testing for your wife indicates that she does not have vWD, and you are Type 1, then that sure does seem like it would be the version your daughter has since it does not require homozygosity, so all children you have, regardless of partner, would have a 50/50 chance of having Type 1.\n\nWould treatment for Type 1 and Type 2 be largely the same? I know Type 2 is more symptomatic and requires more scrutiny, so a treatment plan is probably more urgent for Type 2 than Type 1. If they are still treated similarly (desmopressin?) I can see your daughter's hematologist thinking it is not necessarily crucial to get into the genetics. On the other hand, I would probably want to get it figured out, like you and your hematologist do, if it were me. I would say get a second opinion, and perhaps your hematologist would say the same, too - but since your daughter is not his/her patient, maybe that is not something s/he can say to you.\n\nPersonally it took me a long, long time to find my new long-term hematologist after I moved across the country, so if one does not seem to be on the page with you, it is better to find someone who will be before you get into an emergency.  Thanks for taking the time to reply. \n\n\n&gt;I thought multimer count was not the method for diagnosing Type 2 since the subtypes can sometimes return normal multimer levels?\n\n\nSo Type 1 can be classified a decreased quantity of vWF, whereas Type 2 is mostly characterized as a decrease in function of vWF (though my understanding of Type 2 is that the majority will also show a decrease in quantity).\n\n\nThe multimer test is basically a test of function in that it looks for abnormal sub-units of vWF. Abnormal sub-units indicate abnormal function. My daughter apparently has abnormal sub-units, whereas I do not. Very weird. My brother is also vWF Type 1, and his son also came back with an abnormal multimer test...\n\n\n&gt;Would treatment for Type 1 and Type 2 be largely the same? I know Type 2 is more symptomatic and requires more scrutiny, so a treatment plan is probably more urgent for Type 2 than Type 1.\n\n\nIf Type 2 responds to DDAVP, then that is what is used for minor bleeds. If it does not, then you have to rely on Wilate or Humate or blood transfusions. Neither I nor my daughter have had DDAVP challenges, but she has a box of Wilate in our refrigerator in case of emergency that we are supposed to bring with us when we go out of town. \n\n\n\n&gt;Personally it took me a long, long time to find my new long-term hematologist after I moved across the country, so if one does not seem to be on the page with you, it is better to find someone who will be before you get into an emergency.\n\n\nYeah, my last hematologist did not really understand VWD all that well. He literally told me that I knew more about the disease than he did. \n\n Ah, thanks for the info on testing. I have not read up on vWD in a long, long time, so I was obviously pretty confused on testing/subtypes.\n\nIf your brother and his son are going through the same thing it is...definitely puzzling. I am surprised your daughter's hematologist does not have more interest in this, honestly.\n\nI would not be surprised to hear hematologists say you know more about it than they do. I still hear it all the time, especially in emergency departments (one hematologist even had the audacity to say it to me in the ICU after I had to beg him for factor). It makes finding a good hematologist more difficult...I had one for a while that I thought was \"good\" but really he just deferred to me on every decision \"we\" made, so when I ended up being wrong about a particular episode, it ended up being a lot of wasted time until I finally went to someone else. The best hematologists I have had in my life were both doctors who regularly did lectures on bleeding disorders, so they knew their stuff. The problem was that they were frequently out of the office for this reason, too. I would ask for yourself and possibly your daughters dad to get retested. I have VW type 1, my sister has VW type 2. Turned out my dad had two genetic mutations. Might be worth a look into. I am sure you can also acquire Von willebrands if you are prone to autoimmune disorders so possibly look into that option. Do not be scared to ask questions. Thanks for the reply.  \nThat is fascinating that your dad had 2 genetic mutations. I do not think that is what is going on, cuz my brother and I are both verified Type 1 (no abnormal proteins in multimer assay), but we each have one kid that came out Type 2 when tested at 2 years old (no other kids affected by VWD). My aunt, uncle, and dad are also Type 1.\n\n\nBTW, what do you mean by having myself and my daughter's dad tested? I am my daughter's dad. Did you mean daughter's grandpa, i.e., my dad?  Apologies I meant your daughters mother! Sorry for the confusion. But I have also seen you have said she does not have it either. That is really strange. Would your haematologist possibly contact your daughters haematologist on your behalf? They could possibly discuss it together to come up with some answers for you. It is so frustrating sometimes as I feel there are not a lot of answers and information out there about bleeding disorders so it is very isolating. You could also reach out to any bleeding disorder charities. I know the one in my area sometimes has events where you can talk to specialists and really get some inside knowledge. Worth a try. Thanks, I will look into any events in my area.  I treat kids with von Willebrands.  I would consider a repeat of the VWF multimers to confirm this.  Your daughter could have type 2A or type 2M, or even type 2B if the genes for your wife give her a mild form and your daughter inherited both genes.  \n\nVWF protein increases as we age.  That is why guys with Type 1 VWD frequently get fewer symptoms as they get into adulthood.  Especially if as a kid, their levels were only mildly abnormal.\n\nWomen get this too, but often have menstrual bleeding or bleeding with childbirth that keeps them needing treatment.\n\nWith VWD, as second look is always best and now is standard of care for post-pubertal girls. The CDC has a great website for Von Willebrand Disease.  The Foundation of Women and Girls with Blood Disorders has some stuff for girls with VWD.  Give them a look.  Afterall, you paid for the CDC site, might as well use it. Thanks for your replies.

I do not have any experience with this procedure or any other orthopedic procedures.  I am hoping to get by without them.  That being said, I would probably be more conservative in about this decision.  What about doing the synovectomy now and seeing how it goes?  Cannot the more invasive procedure be done later, if needed? I would not heard of this but I did find an article where medical professionals discussed what it can help with and what it cannot help with (\n\nMaybe pertinent: \"A 2007 research study co-authored by Silva and James V. Luck Jr., MD, published in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, reviewed 40 radial head excisions performed in men with severe hemophilia A or B during a 35-year period, from 1969 to 2004. Patients referred for surgery had severe pain, limited range of motion and chronic bleeding in their elbows. The results showed that the surgery successfully reduced pain in 70% of patients; of those, 30% reported complete pain relief. Further, bleeding frequency was decreased and there was a low rate of complications. One patient developed nerve palsy after the surgery, but it resolved within six months. In addition, there was a mean gain of 63 degrees in the pronation/supination arc in the forearm.\"\n\nBut just to reiterate, that study was only covering 40 people and across several decades. And I am just sitting here chuckling at \"/r/thritis\". Yes it can, and as of right now if that is what I am leaning towards. I was considering just getting a steroid shot and putting off the surgery for another year or so but I already paid the deductible on my insurance with my surgery earlier this year and my elbow has been keeping me from mountain biking which is my only real source of exercise so I think I should do something. That is a great article, thanks. I had read a study on the procedure but that article laid out a lot of it that I I have been wondering about. The doctor that talks to said he would be reluctant to recommend the procedure to a patient that had a pretty good range of motion. My arrange is not very limited right now, but one thing my surgeon said was that they would be able to do a more thorough synovectomy if they had the elbow joint open for the excision already versus performing arthroscopically. Something else to think about I guess. On a somewhat related topic, have you looked into a copay program from your factor product manufacturer?  Some of them are pretty generous and could entirely cover your annual deductible.  That could help take the financial aspect out of your surgery decision. Ya i am signed up for that through baxalta (i think that is what they are called these days. Hard to keep up). They pay up to 12 grand in copay for factor products. Huge help!  The several decades part worries me.  This would include the people who did not get factor as kids and the HIV/HBV era, as well as recombinant era.  Needs a breakdown of how it worked in each era. I have had 3 synovectomies on my left elbow and on the 2nd surgery the I had the radial removed. At the time the pain I had was greatly reduced, have not experienced many bleeds since then (2013) only time I get bleeds is through trauma to the elbow. \nMy elbow was constantly swollen before the radial head removal so unable to tell if the range of movement had improved. Thanks for the feedback! Do you think the excision worked any better than the synovectomies? I have had a few synovectomies so I know that it is hard to quantify exactly how much it helps or does not, if at all. My surgeon said that the excision could cause a loss of strength in my arm. Did you find that to be the case? I do not really understand if that means that it would be painful to the point where I could not lift as much or if the muscles would not function the same or what. Well after I had the 1st synovectomy (in 2011) my elbow became super inflamed so the surgeon decided to do another synovectomy and at the same time did a radial head excision (in 2013). Early this year I had another synovectomy so I lasted around 4 years before the pain got unbearable. \n\nBefore I had these surgeries my left arm was weak and had a lot less muscle mass compared to my right arm. Now after I am able to do light exercise so I am able to put a bit more strength and size.\n\nUltimately I think it has helped me a lot. The only problem I had with excision is that I was recovering for a lot longer than was suggested.", "Hemophilia Camp Hi everyone,\nWe are gearing up for our annual pediatric hemophilia camp in Oklahoma.

It is really helpful man , appreciate it\u270c\ufe0f Hey man, glad to hear the news. I will be going to Canada as well for education purposes. Factors in Canada are not very expensive compared to my home country (India). As an international student we all are required to have an health insurance. Make sure you get the health insurance by Blue Cross. They cover blood disorders. I got this information like the gentleman above mentioned from the official website/email. Also, if you think factors in your home country are cheaper, I would recommend you ship them to Canada when you reach there. You can speak with FedEx for that service. Also, make sure when you exporting you have doctors prescription; bill of factors; and other basic documents which prove that the medication is not hazardous. There is a limit to how much expenses are allowed to an international student which is about $ 20k for I guess 5 years, for temporary residents. So make sure you do not go above that when asking Canadian insurance/government for factors. I would recommend to get your own factors. Also prepare a good financial plan which they would ask you for when doing medical test for acquiring visa. If your plans are well designed you will pass soon. I have experienced this medical issue and I am still waiting for my visa. But happy to tell you that I passed my medical. So do not worry about it. If you need more help just PM. All the best! Thanks man really! I am in the US and would move to Canada if I could. It seems unlikely though if you are not a student or have a job there to be able to get citizen ship and insurance. Things are ok here but that could all change with this election. I am really hoping for the best but it has not always been easy to get insurance in the past. It still is not, but at least it is possible, for me anyway. I do not see moving to a country with better health insurance as a realistic goal for someone with severe hemophilia who is not a student or providing and essential service, or marrying a citizen. Canada is pretty nice tho. BC is amazing. Hope the election goes iin the way that you envisioned.

Hey guys, I have a couple of somewhat stupid questions about how the US prescriptions work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  am coming from Europe to start my PhD program in the US this fall. I have hemophilia A (severe), and I was on prophy with Advate for the last 8 years. On top of providing generous stipend+scholarship, my US university covers premium for its own commercial health insurance plan (the carrier is Wellfleet, if it tells you anything). This plan does not have an in-network deductibles (so the insurance kicks in right off), and a copay for month's worth of Advate would be $75. However, what is the algorithm for actually getting the prescription in the US?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my country, the steps are as follows. I meet with my hematologist once or twice a year at most. She writes a recommendation letter (which includes my fresh blood stats + her opinion about how much IU I should be getting per month). I give this letter to my therapist (call them primary care physician (PCP) if you want), who then sends the letter to the Department of Healthcare for approval. Once approved (usually takes a week or so in early January), my PCP (**not my hematologist**!) writes a prescription. To get a refill, I call my PCP's office once a month, come get a paper (sic!) refill receipt (because pharmacies are too busy or lazy to call/email every patient's physicians), and then go to pharmacy (which is literally located downstairs in the same building) for a refill. I spend no more than 7 mins per month to get my monthly refill. Universal healthcare does wonders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wonder if this process would be any more stressful and lengthy in the US? Do I need to make an appointment with my hematologist each time a need a prescription/refill? Would my PCP be able to write me a prescription? -- asking this because my university's on-campus health center does not have a hematologist, so I probably would need a referral for an in-network hematologist. How many refills can I get on one prescription before I would need to get a new one (I mean, is there a limit?). How long does it usually takes for you all US bros and broettes to get your stuff after you got your prescription? Sorry if these questions sound naive and/or stupid. Any input is welcome. I cannot offer any advice but would also like to know. I am UK based so cannot speak to accurately about the system in America. It seems like it can be arduous if you do not know how to navigate it all. I think most people receive their factors via an specialist intermediary pharmacy...(part of the reason factors are so much pricier in the states)...I would recommend contacting HFA (hemophilia federation of America) ( From people I speak to in the community, they are very good at helping people navigate the insurance system and will likely be able to give you some expert advice. I worked in America for just over 2 months and brought enough factor with me for that time. I am assuming you will at least be heading out to the states with an initial stock? Might be worth speaking to your physician about prescribing you a slightly bigger stock just so you have more time to play with once you arrive in the US. Best of luck! I second much of the above. You will likely need to come with at least a month's worth of factor. Your hematologist should also write a letter for you detailing your diagnosis, current treatment plan, and any contact information in case there are questions.\nOnce you come to the U.S., you will need to see a hematologist or other physician who is comfortable prescribing factor. (Start looking NOW to make an appointment.) The doctor will write the prescription, send it to a pharmacy (typically called a specialty or home care pharmacy) who will mail you a big box with everything you need for infusions for a while. The pharmacy will typically call you when they think you are low on supplies, or you can call them, to fill a new order. The doctor is removed from the process at this point, but you will still need an annual visit with a US-based hematologist.\nThe bigger question here is insurance. You will need proof of insurance that is 1. Accepted by your doctor and pharmacy, and 2. Covers your medication. Ideally, 3. Is not incredibly expensive.\n\nDo consider reaching out to Hemophilia Federation of America. I am in the US! And have Severe A like you. It is been simpler than you might think, at least it has been for me. I meet my hematologist twice (sometimes once a year now that I am an adult) and she writes a prescription. She sends it to a speciality pharmacy that is under my insurance. I call the speciality pharmacy whenever I need to refill. The pharmacy asks questions. Easy really I think it is unlikely that you will find a PCP who will prescribe Advate for you.  You should ( in your new city.  Check the HTC's doctors against your new insurance plan's website of in-network providers.\n\nIn my experience factor products are covered under most insurance plans Major Medical coverage, not under prescription drug coverage.  You may need to enroll in ( from the drug company.\n\nYou will most likely have your prescription dispensed by a specialty pharmacy of your insurance plan's choosing.  Once your HTC has faxed the prescription to the specialty pharmacy, they will overnight ship a month's supply in a insulated shipping box.  You will have to contact the specialty pharmacy on a monthly basis to schedule new shipments of factor and supplies.  Most prescriptions, depending on how it is written by the doctor, are good for a year of refills.\n\nI hope this helps. I am a US hemophilia treater.  It sounds like you have pretty comprehensive insurance and should have little trouble.  So, you know your city that you will be living in and the university you are part of.  Go onto the CDC's hemophilia page (cdc.gov/hemophilia) or the national hemophilia foundation's page (hemophilia.org) and look for the HTC directory.  Enter your information and if you have an HTC in your town and it is in your plan, then you just need to call and set up an appointment with the hemophilia treatment center.  If you do not have an HTC in your school's plan listed on these sites, then call your insurance company (Wellfleet) and give them your location and ask for the \"In-Network\" hemophilia treatment center or provider in your city.  Get that contact information and call for an appointment.\n\nAdvate is readily available here and you can get a US prescription from the HTC on your first visit.  You can get it from your provider if they have a 340b program and dispense.  You can also get it from an in network pharmacy by asking the Welfleet people for that information.  \n\nLast thing to do with Wellfleet is to ask for an \"Insurance Case Manager\".  These are employed by the company and are there to help manage expensive or complex care and generally save both you and the company both money and time and are a good thing to get (and it will be free to you.)", "Chicago Hemophilia Research Incentive between 200-450 Dollars (Must be face to face in Person) Research company is conducting compensated opinion research/interviews in Chicago, IL.

Could be fluctuating With our 2nd son our first blood test showed low factor 8 levels because the blood was a room temperature for too long. We later got a 2nd and 3rd test that both showed normal levels. It may be something similar to that.  This happened to my friend I met at hemo camp. When he was 25 he told me he did not have to infuse anymore and he was not getting bleeds. He was a severe all the way through camp age cap of 18/19. No idea how or why  All these case should be studied. When my moderate child was born, he was at less than 1% but our doctor warned he could be using all his factor to heal from childbirth and we would not know his actual level for sure until later. They were also doing heel pricks and other things before he was diagnosed. It was not until he was healed up and home that we tested again to find out he was a moderate (3-4%). Was your son ill at either time? He was moved to intensive care 12 hours after birth when it was discovered he had a bleed in his head (between the skull and scalp). \nHe also had a traumatic delivery where he was almost delivered vaginally (the top of his head was showing) but then got stuck, had to be backed in and delivered by c section almost 24 hours later.\n\nThanks guys Possibly at birth...

From .04% to 8% depending on my body weight and overall health I would seek a consultation with your son's hematologist and have him/her review the labs in context with the status of affected family members.

So I had regular bleeds in my knee and it has gotten worse since then. Luckily we were able to travel to belgium and stay here for the medical reasons. I had lesser bleeds with the medication but my knee still would give me a hard time and get bleeds ever so often. Fastforward to current days, I barely use my right leg because it is gotten so thin due to lack of movement and I cannot fully straighten or bend my knee but I was told that during surgery I was able to and they say that I should be able to get my full range of movement with physiotherapy. But here is the caveat, my knee is obviously swollen after the surgery and they are trying to force me to do the excersices that are painful even with the painkillers. I have spoken to doctors about it and they still say that I should be trying to do the excersices. Which I try to do but I really cannot go as far as they want me to. So I do not know, do I take my time or do I try to force the movement but I am so scared that it will worsen the swelling and obviously the pain. Trust the advice of the doctors! I know moving after a knee replacement seems so daunting, but the swelling will go down. \n\nThe swelling is not bleed related. You will be fine. In a year you will wonder how you ever did without your new knee :) I have had both of my knees done separately in the US and I can assure you that physical therapy hurts.  I had different physical therapists each time and one pushed and pulled until the staples ripped out of the incision while the second therapist had a much more zen approach, mind over matter, which worked better for me.  But each of these methods pushed me and my knee to the limit and I wanted to cry and beat each of them with my cane at the same time.  It hurts and it sucks but hang in there, therapy is the key to getting up and moving around again.  Just take it one session at a time. Listen to your doctors, but listen to your body when it tells you to stop. If you can regain movement and strength and have the potential for a better quality of life, pursue it.\n\nMy best friend has been in a wheelchair since the 7th grade and gave up on all the physical therapy. He will never walk again and cannot recieve a knee replace because his bones are too soft. \n\nKeep working at it. Best wishes from the U.S.! Are you working with hematologist? Help,\n\nI feel your pain. Quite literally! I am in the UK I have had a total knee replacement at a few years ago and I was only 26.\n\nAs the other posters have mentioned it is best to get help and follow the advice of your haemophilia specialists. With that said I was in a similar position as you post surgery. \n\nThere are different types of prosthesis used in knee replacement surgeries and it is important to know what kind you have. My knee bends to about 105 degrees which is about the maximum range for the type I have. It took me over a year to get to that range. It can be quite annoying at times not having that extra movement but you get used it.\n\nThe swelling also took around a year to go down. The swelling is often post operative swelling rather than a bleed I had physiotherapy weekly. Which initially involved very basic leg raises before moving on to balance and cross trainer stuff. There is definitely a balance between bending the knee and pushing the limits of pain. Trust in your carers and listen to your body. I felt like my surgeon and physio were pushing me too much (at one point I demand an X-ray because I was convinced something had moved or came out of pace)  it will take time to get to the maximum range but with sone patience and exercise you will get there.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to chat", "AHCA legislation repeals key protections on preexisting conditions. Hemophilia community stands to lose big  Hemophilia. Let me just rant here for a minute. Obviously I am a hemophiliac. I inject my medication two times a week (it used to be more, too). Each treatment I take costs $1.89 per unit. Each treatment has a minimum of 3,000 units. So conservatively that is ~$5,670 PER TREATMENT, so about $11,340 a week. So, you do the math for a year worth of medication and you are up well over half a million dollars, $589 680 to be exact. And that is if I have no break through bleeds (bleeding in to joints and muscles without forewarning -- note, i can not control break through bleeding it is called spontaneous breakthrough bleeding for a reason!). If we do the math at the current rates and expand it over a 50 year period (assuming I live 77 years) I would be costing $29,484,000. That is just on medication alone, like I said, I have a lot of problems with break through bleeding (which I assume could only drive that price up above the 29 million mark). Last year alone I did 130 treatments. So $5670 per treatment, 130 treatments in 2016-17 is an earnest $737,100. \n\nI just want to give a little perspective of what it means to live with a pre-existing condition. I was born with hemophilia because of genetic mutation, meaning the disease has not been present in my family until I was born. \n\nMy heart hurts for any hemophiliac who has this unnecessary burden put on them.\n\nEdit: the price of Eloctate is actually 1.98 so my math is slightly wrong, but close enough.  You are preaching to the choir here (article is on r/hemophilia if you did not notice :p) but all of this is so, so true. I am scared about what will happen if they put everyone who can afford it in a high risk pool and just assume everything will just work out. People will die. I just needed to vent. I have Severe Hemophilia A. I just wanted to write it all out because it seems to have more impact if you show them all of the math added up over a span of a year or years.  Agreed, severe a here too.  I already had a huge vent on social media but this is ridiculous. As fish said, my treatment is around the same price. I am currently on medicaid because I live with one parent with a normal paying job. The last thing I have ever wanted was Hemophilia to affect others around me, now I have the possibility of putting my family in finical ruin because I need to live. Why do we live in a world where a piece of paper is worth more than a human life. I know Obamacare is not perfect, but it is the reason I am alive. Between two years I was in the E.R almost 50 times. Can you imagine how much money must have been used just so I could get medicine? It is inhumane and horrid. I am speaking with legislation on Wednesday and will hopefully educate them on the struggles of Hemophilia. Remember that chronic diseases like hemophilia get on medicaid waiver, or S-CHIP pretty automatically.  Remember that the bill passed in the house has to go to the Senate where it will be modified.  Also recall that the flaw of Obamacare was that no one did the math.  You would be well and truly screwed by Obamacare in 2017, and certainly in 2018.  The cost of the ban on preexisting conditions was so high that premiums for single policies became brutally expensive, insurance companies lost a ton of money and they quit selling policies.  You would fail to be covered.\n\nIs this bill perfect?  It has problems.  But hemophiliacs need to understand that in other countries, care is funded by taxes and the government decides who gets what.  You may find that you get to go back to short acting clotting factor, or maybe stop prophy at a certain age.\n\n \n  &gt;Remember that chronic diseases like hemophilia get on medicaid waiver, or S-CHIP pretty automatically.\n\nIt is hilarious how hard you are trying to spin the fact that no insurer will be willing to cover me with a conventional plan at a reasonable cost after this passes. In a healthcare system which is still mostly private and under an administration hell-bent on stripping away government benefits, this shift is going to HURT people. On some level you have to understand that.\n\n &gt;Also recall that the flaw of Obamacare was that no one did the math. You would be well and truly screwed by Obamacare in 2017, and certainly in 2018. \n\nAnd this is different from a bill that Republican Congressmen are ramming through the house without even so much as a CBO analysis how?\n\n&gt;The cost of the ban on preexisting conditions was so high that premiums for single policies became brutally expensive, insurance companies lost a ton of money and they quit selling policies.\n\nA few things here. First of all, premiums rose at their slowest rate during the Obamacare era that we have seen in the last 30 years. The average family premium rose ( That rate of increase is actually much lower than the previous five years (up 31% from 2006 to 2011) and the five years before that (up 63% from 2001 to 2006). Yes premiums have risen, but it is simply ignorant to attribute that trend to the ACA.\n\n&gt;You would be well and truly screwed by Obamacare in 2017, and certainly in 2018. The cost of the ban on preexisting conditions was so high that premiums for single policies became brutally expensive, insurance companies lost a ton of money and they quit selling policies. You would fail to be covered.\n\nThere are ways to solve this. Democrats have been saying for years that the mandate is too low to incentivize adherence or cover high-risk patients. In addition to raising that you could also introduce a public option, another common-sense idea that Republicans have blocked.\n\n&gt;You would be well and truly screwed by Obamacare in 2017, and certainly in 2018. The cost of the ban on preexisting conditions was so high that premiums for single policies became brutally expensive, insurance companies lost a ton of money and they quit selling policies. You would fail to be covered.\n\nA) the data does not bear this out, and B) if so, solve the problem with a limited fix rather than tearing down the entire system. The AHCA is a mess. Do you even understand that we are \n\n&gt;But hemophiliacs need to understand that in other countries, care is funded by taxes and the government decides who gets what. You may find that you get to go back to short acting clotting factor, or maybe stop prophy at a certain age.\n\nOh believe me, I know what our alternatives are. In other first world countries, robust public options and single payer systems generally lead to better health outcomes and the data DOES bear that out. \n\n&gt;Remember that the bill passed in the house has to go to the Senate where it will be modified.\n\nEquivocation and silencing. This bill exists in a certain form now, and thus that form can be analyzed and criticized. I would like to start making noise about something that could potentially ruin my life BEFORE it happens, thank you very much. Yeah but better drugs are on the way - I am on the ACE910 trial, have not done the old infusion in over 2 months. But just think, even after we get \"the cure,\" whether through new shots or gene therapy or whatever, there is always someone with something rarer that does not have as much research going into it. They are the ones who will need more advocacy. I totally agree with this, which is why everyone should reach out and support NORD, the National Organization for Rare Diseases.  Strength in numbers!  What frustrates me, is that we have had medicine to stop our bleeds for over 20 years.  That is safe, and effective (for most, putting inhibitors aside).   I would gladly use the old monoclate P of the 90's if it meant lower prices, and I did not feel like such a drain on the healthcare system.\n\nI mean... how are we expected NOT to feel guilty?   It, figuratively, kills me to know pharmcos are making these ridiculous sums off our suffering.   And no one talks about it...\n\nWhen was the last time you saw ANY activism for hemophila?  What about a coin jar at your local gas station?   They do not exist...  In a world where charity is so \"upvoted,\" we seem to be ignored.\n\n\nI do not know how to do anything about this.   I do what I can, and when I have someone is attention, I tell them just how much it costs, and say \"You could write your local representative\" and such... but of course they will not.   \n\nFrustration...    That is my bit up on the soapbox...  for now.  I will not step off it until the prices are fair.   I seriously wonder how much profit the pharmcos make off us.   It is got to be obscene numbers, as you said, to live as a hemophiliac will means they are making millions off us. ( &gt; Remember that chronic diseases like hemophilia get on medicaid waiver, or S-CHIP pretty automatically.\n\nFalse. I am 35 years old and have always been denied medicaid and every other service out there pre-ACA. After ACA, I have a platinum healthcare plan for half my monthly salary with no deductible and low copays. \"Is this bill perfect? It has problems.\" If your timing belt is flawed, you do not burn down the entire fucking car.\n\n D- for effort though. They will never respond, but I wanted to thank you for taking the time to spell it out for them (and us).  I am happy to find someone willing to explain it in detail for such a relatively small community. &gt; When was the last time you saw ANY activism for hemophila?\n\nThere is Washington Days, and to their credit the NHF and HFA do lots of work to help patients get the care they need, but the biggest problem is that we have gotten into that 20-year-rut where most of the improvement in our medication has been incremental (in terms of safety and durability).\n\nOnce everyone is complacent with 2-3x/week infusions, nobody gives a shit to push for an improvement. But maybe what we will see is that once the new generation of drugs comes through, there will be another push because it is such a huge difference in how levels are managed. Is not this what I was saying? \nA 20 year rut. \nWhen I mention this you tell me to crawl back under my rock  I mean... if we only need a shot when we get hurt... so be it.  I am fine with that.   Prophy is overkill in my world.   \n\nI am not a fan of the NHF...  If my mom listened to the doctors, and gave me the recombinates of the late 80's and early 90's, I would definitely have AIDS.   The way those doctors looked at me was ....  creepy.   Not a fan, but maybe that is just my state's chapter - they seemed more interested in making money off us than helping. &gt; if we only need a shot when we get hurt... so be it. I am fine with that. Prophy is overkill in my world.\n\nTreat-on-trauma is why I cannot straighten my right arm, prophylaxis is why I was able to live a normal life. If you look at the long term, prophylaxis was a game-changer.\n\n&gt;I am not a fan of the NHF... If my mom listened to the doctors, and gave me the recombinates of the late 80's and early 90's, I would definitely have AIDS. \n\nI think your timeline is off by a few years... because I was born in '85 and taking factor by the late 80s/early 90s and I was fine.\n\nI am not 100% versed on the politics of that era and I am admittedly biased b/c my parents were active in my local NHF chapter (so it may have been a chapter thing for you), but where else is advocacy/activism going to come from?\n\nPatients born in the early '80s and earlier have to deal with HIV, hepatitis, and all the other complications of that era.\n\nPatients born between '85 and about 1995-2000 dodged that bullet, grew up with prophylaxis, but will still inevitably have a lot of long-term issues to cope with.\n\nAll the patients born after 2010 or so? They are getting long-term factor, they are getting subq shots with monthlong half lives, they are getting gene therapy. They will experience nothing like we did.\n\nThe battle is being won, but nobody's putting a ribbon on their car for policy wonk issues like lowering insurance premiums or ensuring access w/ pre-existing conditions. That is the conundrum. I was born in the late'ish 70's...   Got Hep C from a designated donor.  Harvoni took care of that 2 years ago.      I started taking factor recombs in 94.  Maybe 93?\n\nEither way... the one that the doctors at the local place to me suggested one that would have given me aids - you might be right - they might have suggested it in the 80's.   Not entirely sure there.  \n\nI have got a fused ankle...  and my left elbow is pretty jacked up...  arthritis in all my joints... knees especially...   I guess since I grew up, until I was 14 or 15, going to the hospital to get bags of plasma, i have got quite a bit of patience... probably too much.    Sounds like you went through some of that rough stuff too, but you might not remember too much?   \n\nSo uh...  subq shots?   Is that for Hem B?  Because...  well.. if I have not heard about a subq shot for A, then I would definitely be wanting prophy.   Monthlong half lives??   You have to be talking about B.   If not... I need to wake up!    I dose Advate when I need it, and if I am going to be active and think it would be a good idea, I give myself a shot.    I was born at the end of '85 and was part of the first wave to use prophy around... '93-94 I guess? My right elbow is jacked up but aside from two ankle synovectomies I have done pretty well.\n\n&gt;So uh...  subq shots?   Is that for Hem B?  Because...  well.. if I have not heard about a subq shot for A, then I would definitely be wanting prophy.   Monthlong half lives??   You have to be talking about B.   If not... I need to wake up! \n\nYou have been asleep for far too long - look up ACE910. I am in the Phase 3 trial, A, subq, once a week. The Phase 1 results said half lives of 5 weeks possible, but 1 are not no thing... I have not held a butterfly since late February. Are you in the US?\n\nMost of the info I can find about ACE910 is that there is been some problems with clots...   Do you have any good links? No (see flair).\n\nHere is an article on the (\n\nAnother from (\n\nThe clotting issues are all patients w/ inhibitors who took a bypassing agent; I do not have an inhibitor so it has not been an issue for me. The patient who died refused a blood transfusion or something weird... who knows what his deal is but my hematologist was not worried about a similar issue affecting me. Have you heard of anything for us in the US? Sure, they are running the trial in both countries and I have met others online who are on it.\n\nI am pretty sure I only managed to get in because Japanese patients do not really go for clinical trials and I would not stop bugging my hematologist about it &gt;_&gt; As a Brit, my heart goes out to you guys. I hope there is some sort of solution that keeps you dosed up.\n\nI have not gone without prophylaxis since I was first diagnosed. I cannot imagine what state my body would be in now if my parents had had to ration out my livesaving medication. This would be a great time to check and see if your manufacturer offers a failsafe option, like CSL offers the ( program.\n\nWhat would be terrible is hemophiliacs going non-compliant and skipping occasional prophy doses so they started building up their own buffers in case there were any issues down the road. That would be irresponsible, and /so I would definitely not recommend that. Interesting.   It is not in the Hemophilia mags that I get here in the USA.    I think i will stay away from clinical trials, but I am glad it is working for you!!   That is awesome!   Hopefully they will work out the kinks and we can have normal lives!    But, really - what is a normal life, anyways? Lots of people are talking about it.  Want to know where most of your money goes?  Homecare companies.  Pharma is not innocent.  But in the US, Homecare and drop ship pharmacy companies are big cost factors.  And when you think about all the \"work\" they do for the cost addition they add, you realize quickly why 1 of you can keep a small firm in business.\n\nActivism for hemophilia is controlled by the NHF and the HFA and focuses on getting more money from the fed to fund research in big centers, and more money to feed the pharma/homecare beast, as well as to decrease regulatory restrictions on the beast.\n\nI am a pediatric treater.  I teach my students in medical school and pharmacy school how to look at cost.  I teach them how to dose factor in \"Berkshire Hathaway equivalents\".  A 20kg boy needing NovoSeven RT gets an injection that is equivalent to X shares of BRKb, Y ounces of gold or platinum, and Z hours of work at minimum wage.\n\nPlasma derived factor is never coming back.  Even with the SIPPET trial, no manufacturer is going to take the legal risk of going back into the factor concentration business.  The next virus that comes a long would bankrupt them in a flash.  Monoclate P was a decent product.  It would be useful today, but there is no way any of them could justify that risk to their shareholders.\n\n Recombinant factor does not transmit HIV.  No hemophiliac has seroconverted due to factor since 1985 (thank God).  Each generation of recombinant factor VIII has less and less human derived protein.  Recombinate had human albumin.  The stuff done to the product to make it viral safe is nothing to albumin.  Generation 2 products have albumin in processing, but not in the final product.  Albumin is super stable, but not as stable as a Prion, so we moved on generation 3 products that have no human derived protein.  All to decrease the risk of Prion infection (something that as yet, has not happened in a hemophiliac.)\n\n", "Sanofi Hits the Brakes on Its Hemophilia Program   I got a call from my doctor on Monday telling me the study would be paused. Hopefully they come up with an action plan soon so the study can continue. This is an amazing treatment and in my opinion the best way to treat hemophilia other than an actual cure. So do you have to switch to something else while the study is paused? I will just go back to regular clotting factor if I need it. They said it will take up to six months for the affect of the treatment to wear off so I probably will not even need factor for a while yet. What about the drug makes you feel it is the best way to treat? Going from infusing twice a week (I was on longer lasting factor) to just treating once a month was huge for me. It gives me much more freedom and I do not always have to worry about infusing or packing along factor  before I go somewhere. And the fact that it is a simple shot that takes seconds to administer is nice too.\n\nAny treatment that greatly minimizes the impact or influence hemophilia has on you is a win in my book and fitusiran has done just that. Cool, thank you for sharing. Any thoughts on the Phase 1/2 death or the current thrombotic events that caused the trial to pause? I am very curious if they will find a path forward. Sure man. I cannot share too much but I will say the death was a result of the doctors misdiagnosing the issue the patient had. It was not necessarily a fault of the treatment. These latest adverse events that have happened I think will only be a bump in the road. They will definitely find a path forward though it may take some time due to the turtle-like pace of medical studies. So far I have not heard of one adverse event that involved a healthy person with no other ailments. Every single case I have heard of has involved a person that was on other medication or had a history of medical complications.", "Multiyear Follow-up of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ Gene Therapy for Hemophilia A  interesting. Am I right in thinking this is the BMRN trial which is currently pushing for FDA approval. Would of course need to see the more in-depth results (cannot access the full article) but it appears levels seem have to come down since the some of the earlier results shared. Maintaining expression is going to be key, but with that said, if you can get someone firmly in to the lower end of mild phenotype, prevent bleeds and remove the need for factor prophy, then it probably hits the mark for a lot of people out there. Wondering how this will be priced across different regions.... Yes, it is the BioMarin candidate, Valrox.", "Hey Reddit, I am a 13 year old who is suffering a bleeding episode.

We have been told that hemlibra could be on the cards over the next year or so. He is doing really well on refacto every 2 days but obviously a once a week subcutaneous prophylaxis sounds exciting. My concern is changing from something that is working and stable to an unknown....  I have severe A with and inhibitor and am starting Hemlibra soon, if I remember I will get back to you with results.  Hope it goes well for you  Where are you from? I am glad that you got a chance to try something less invasive than intravenous therapy. I am in EU and I hope Hemlibra will come asap.  UK. It has not been ok'd for non-inhibitor patients yet but our consultant feels that it will happen.   My nephew is on it and it is DOPE.  He is had inhibitors for years and multiple bleeds a week. He started it over a year ago and has had zero bleeds since. Everyone I know on it says it is life changing. Once it is gets approved for non inhibitors patients I expect a ton of people shifting over to it  How old is your nephew? He is 14. I do know a family with an 8 YO on it and he loves it to. The just got his port removed because of it. I work in hemophilia as well so feel free to DM me if you want to talk more and depth  I have Severe Hemophilia A with an inhibitor. I have been taking Hemelibra (or ecuzimumab) since the clinical trial started. I have been on it since Last May and I have not had a bleed since.

My son has been on it now for 6 months, not a single bleed...not even a bruise.  And the subq infusion is soooo much better than IV, especially for the little ones.  Hemlibra is going to completely change hemophilia treatment. Your nephew is so lucky to have access to this medication.

I recently got a thigh bleed yesterday which is really hurting but it got me thinking about this topic. For me, back in fifth grade, I got a bleed in my thigh that bled into my butt cheek (I know funny.) That pain was so excruciating, way worse than any joint bleed I have had Worst pain was my Iliopsoas bleed of 97. Confined to a wheelchair for about a month.  Duodenum. Thought I was dieing haha.  That is exactly what I had, got put into the hospital for three days but luckily nothing worse. i get one bleed about every 2 and a half years that is so bad if you gave me a button to press that let me kill myself I wouldnt last more than 2 days before it was pressed. There is no rhyme or reason to it, hops around all my joints. I can recall having it in elbow, knee and ankle. Never any specific trauma that causes it, always just lurking around the corner.\n\n\nWhile not anywhere near the same scale, bruises on hamstrings burn like a bitch. I know I have had far worse (subdural hematoma that almost killed me, also a couple car accidents) but the first thing that came to mind was in 3rd grade playing kickball in p.e. I was the pitcher, and took a screaming line drive straight to the junk from those hard red kickballs. So for weeks I had a giant purple bruise from my upper thigh to my bellybutton. It killed to use the bathroom.\n\nThe only other thing would be a muscle bleed around my ribs where I could not even get a full breath of air. I remember sitting in the tub in hot water just to loosen my muscles a bit while also getting my factor.    After my shot, I puked from the pain which only made it worse. Fun times. Went flying over my bikehandle, punching that thing into my bladder. peed blood for three days. That was definitely my worst too. Had me practically screaming to even move my leg.  Oh god I pulled my groin muscle a few years back. Worst pain I have experienced in such a long time. Was bedridden in the hospital for two weeks, then on crutches for the better part of a month afterwards. I could not move my leg in any direction without a dull throbbing pain shooting across my groin/leg area. 0/10 would not recommend.  Technically not a bleed but the result of many bleeds... I had a knee replacement a few years back. I had about 15 staples in my knee.... it was gruesome for weeks!  Got a bleed on my inner thigh and couldnt move it at all and apparently pinched a nerve my entire leg had gone numb. I had to go to physical therapy to learn to walk again. Still do not have all the feeling back in my leg that was pain.", "Elbow bleed, need help Hey guys, I have been having really acute pain due to bleeding in my right elbow.

This pain is quite unusual from what I am used to. It is like a clicking pain when I move my arm, like in between half fold of arm is where it hurts the most. Idk how from an X-ray that doctor told me about this. I do not live in a big city with good doctors, so Idk where to go to seek advice. I feel really exhausted, it is my main arm.. I will appreciate any help you guys can give me.\n\nThank you Contact a Hemophlia treatment center if you can, does not matter if you normally see them or not, if you call any HTC near you and tell them what is going on they will help. If it gets really bad do not be afraid to call 911, make sure you have everything ready to explain to them that you have hemophilia and how that connects to your problem. Infuse if you can, if not definitely ice, wrap and rest your arm. I am really sorry this is happening but I dealt with something similar when I was younger, I ended up getting surgery and have dealt with pain ever since. It is part of life for us so also def start looking into long term pain management techniques, stretching and ways to keep your body healthy around your injury. Hope this provides some help! I really appreciate all your words man, thank you! God bless you I use CBD topical cream on my joints. It helps greatly when it comes to pain. Throw a compression sleeve on to help keep it stable and see where you might be able to find a Hemophilia Treatment Center. Okay, I will give it a try mate. Thank you so much What country?  Either way, you can search for a treatment center here: \n\nYou need to get factor ASAP, an x-ray is not going to do anything to stop the bleeding. \n\nChapter on managing bleeds here: \n\nPractice RICE, Rest, ICE (!!!) Compression, Elevation.  However, it is most important that you get factor. If you let a bleed go on for a long period of time there will be irreversible damage done to your joint / muscle. I know that feeling, growing-up I had a lack of availability of factors so I know how it feels, and that is why I have 2 target elbow joints which do not extend fully and are prone to bleeds, the most important advice I can give you, is that if you do not have availability of any factor concentrate, limit your movement as much as possible, rest your arm, put it in a sling and tuck a cushion underneath when lying down for added elevation, my doctor advised me to take etosys-125(for bleeding control) mg and etrobax 100 for minor pain reduction, it had helped me immensely if not more. Coupled with factors its very effective, but in their absense atleast its something, I do not know which city you are in, or if you are in India our outside of it, but if you are in India, your local government hospital must keep factor stocked, you will have to get admitted for them to administer it, if all else fails, there is always the plasma option, though it comes with its own risks, so keep it as a last resort. I hope you get well soon, God bless. Hey, elbow bleeds are one of the toughest to deal with. If you can rest it on a pillow or in a sling, please do. \nIf you have access to factor, I usually do a big dose (depends on your type and weight) for three or so days and then every other day until I have full range of motion back.\nI would avoid lifting anything heavy or fast movements right now as that can trigger a second bleed.\n\nAs for pain management, I would try acetaminophen and some topical Diclofenac cream for the arthritic pain. The clicking sounds like the cartilage is wearing down and causing extra pain. If you can stand ice packs on your elbow, try 15 mins on and then 10 mins off. \n\nYou could try using a compression sleeve to help reduce mobility. When I have a bleed, I always immobilize my arm in a sleeve and brace to make sure it is resting. You are more likely to re-injure your elbow when it is recovering so be really gentle with yourself during this time.\n\nI have been dealing with elbow bleeds since I was 4, these are all things I have done to manage my issues. \n\nRecently, I have been using CBD oil and sometimes stronger medication to manage the pain.\n\nPlease let me know how your doing! I rambled a lot here, sorry. I hope some of this can help! No problem, best wishes. Every elbow bleed I have had took months to heal and I ended up having to imobilize it completely for it to resolve. I would suggest putting it in a cast or a brace that restricts all movement and treating heavily with factor for the foreseeable future. Elbow bleeds are the worst. Next to knees, but still elbows are tricky joints. They can get so bad and you use that joint pretty much anytime you move your body. I sympathize. Like I said, treat like crazy, more than you think is necessary , and immobilize it as much as you possibly can, 100% if possible.\nEdit: sorry, assuming you have access to factor. If you do not PM me I cannot thank you enough mate, I really appreciate everything you said. I am 22, I have been dealing with this since I was 4 months old. I do all those things you suggested except the oil and compression, I will search for the oil though. I live in India and we do not have insurance which can provide me with factors or so, we have to buy it ourselves; which makes it quite hard so I just try to take them when I feel pain, and exactly like you suggested is just expensive for me. I will try to rest it as much as I can. Also, I just woke up and now I feel way better the pain is absolutely reduced to like 3-4% \n\nThank you so much man, God bless you! Hey man, I really appreciate your help! I live in Ambala Cantt, India. I do have access to factors, the public hospitals do have them but they brought some weird brand now, they used to provide Baxter but idk why they stopped. I have had terrible experiences with other brands (almost passed out when tried others) so we just buy factors ourselves, I will try to find the medication you suggested mate. Maybe I just do not rest as much as I need to. I have had worse bleeds but just the doctor saying the cartilage is wearing off scared me, but I hope the medication they suggested would help in the rebuild. Thank you so much brother, I hope you are doing well, if you ever need help please let me know. God bless you! I live in India mate, yes I know man. I guess I am just not resting as much as I need to, thank you so much, God bless you! Hey man! Thanks for the books comment haha! \n\nI understand mate, my problem which I believe many told me is that I do not rest as much as I need to, after one dose I am like \u201coh I am fine\u201d we do have access to factors, as I mentioned above we do not have insurance which covers Hemophilia so we have to buy them ourselves which is just quite expensive, so I just try to take doses carefully, but I guess it is okay and that I should not worry too much\n\nNot long ago but I used to lift weights which really helped me strengthen my elbows and legs but this cartilage thing really scared me, I will use some compression bandage to help stop the movement. I do put ice too though, Ice really makes it feel better. I am about to leave for Canada to start a new life as a student so I just want to be ready for everything, but the continuous bleeds scare me.\n\nThank you so much man, I hope you are doing great, God bless you! Where in Canada? That is awesome. I am in Alaska so we might be Neigbors! Yea having access to enough factor is so helpful. Basically if you are able to do enough infusions you can get through whatever. But rest and immobility is key if you cannot keep your factor levels up. I am serious tho, if you get in a jam and cannot find any factor there are programs available here that can donate to people who have a hard time finding it. It sounds like you have got it covered tho which is great. So what I mean by staying immobile does not just mean not moving your elbow joint. For a while during one of my bad elbow bleeds I had to keep my fingers still, and even how I moved that shoulder. What I would suggest is to infuse, then try to keep that whole arm as still as possible for the next couple days. Then infuse again and repeat, until you are sure that it is t continuing to bleed. This process for me has taken months. But until I did it thoroughly it would just get worse again. Hopefully yours is not that bad, but if it seems to be then follow my advise. Use a sling, and find a way to keep from bending it in even the smallest ways, because when you do, the bleed starts again, and the factor you used to stop the bleed is used up. So you are at square one every time you move it. This will gradually eat away at your cartilage, and you only get one elbow cartilage. Be patient and it will be over soon enough. But if you are not it may last a long long time. The more pateint people with hemophilia can be the healthier we are. Patience truly is a virtue. Ok, enough for now. Hit me up any time. In Vancouver bro Haha, that would be awesome! I understand that completely I often overlook the importance of resting my bleeding joints which, keeps the bleeding running. Damn, that is really impressive, unlike my country which, basically does nothing for people like us. I agree with the 'square one' thing you mentioned, and you know its really demotivating how we sometimes end up there after so much effort. My schedule is kind of tight nowadays since I have to do a lot of studying and typing to finish my assignments. I have a habit of doing work in advance to have more time to learn other things, and also I have OCD and ADHD which, makes it difficult for me to be patient I know I sound really annoying at times with OCD Haha, but you made a really good point man, I will try to rest it as much as I can. Thank you so much! Let me know if you have an Instagram, mine is  just hit me up! Take care! I know it can be hard when medication is limited. The best thing you can do is rest as much as possible and try to do very light stretches and movement to gain strength back.\n\nSleep is SO good for recovery. I am so glad the pain is better. I hope things keep improving. You are going great blood brother! Thank you man! If you have access to it, Celebrex is a non-narcotic anti-inflammatory I take. But I would check with a HTC 1st. Sadly, once the wear starts happening, at that point, all you can do is try and be careful, ice, wrap, rest when needed make it as long as you can before a surgery. \n\nThe rubbing is going to keep causing bleeds, more and more. You can also try getting on helimbra if u can. A lot of my friends have not had major bleeds in a year, it is been about 2 months for me. Thanks man, I will check it out. Stay safe! Well that is just the bitter truth, the wearing off of your cartilage is something which happens naturally as you age, but in our case it is complicated as it makes our injuries more difficult to heal, as far as changing of factor brand goes, and the side effects that you experienced it is completely normal when it first happened to me I had chills, and fever for the first few days, I switched the brands to Novo Nordisk, and from human plasma based to recombinant factor based (which is said to be very safe from the plasma ones), and it went away, rest is something very important, I took it for granted growing up and something which I regret too, you do not want to take it lightly, not only it is the most efficient way of avoiding further damages, but it is also the quickest way to heal, also, I have spare Baxter factor concentrate factors with me, I would be more than happy to give them to you if you need them., Cheers and stay safe. Well, better late than never man. At least you now have a better understanding of these things. I really appreciate your offer, but at the moment we have sufficient factors with us. Thank you, please if you ever need any help let me know or if you need factors. I am just one text away. Take care, stay safe! Compression sleeve for sure. Get one of those basketball/sports ones. I think under armour makes them. Just do not get too tight of one. That slight even pressure helps with pain and movement, plus bring the swelling down. If I bruise a knuckle for example, if I wrap it before it has a chance to swell up, it will be useable almost immediately, but if I let it swell up it takes so much longer to heal. Even so after the fact constant even compression really helps, you just do not want it too tight to cut off circulation. I prefer longer thin Athletic sleeves vs any ace wrap or ace wrap type medical sleeves. I always find those drug store sleeves to be uncomfortable and too short. I also like athletic calf sleeves which help with some of my circulation issues and ankle pain.

I would recommend calisthenics it is has less impact in the joints and produce good results My elbows are messed up. One does not extend, one does not retract all tge way, and nether rotate properly. Cannot really even do push ups From my experience you can do mobility work and Strenghten the right muscles to almost bulletproof your joints, i have a lot of issues of my ankles but i keep them in check always, everyday i do mobility in them and my elbows when feels necessary,  i would recomendo proper research in which way your joint is limited flexion or extension and then starting working towards improve it, yoga really helped me too. There is no cartilage in the one so its bone on bone, nothing I can do.  The other one, the radial head is not in the correct spot, shifted up, and that is what limits the other one.\n\nI use to be a gym rat, 6 days a week.

You should post a before pic I thoughts about it but idk if this sub is the right sub for a before/after pic To begin with i have a relative who i live with here, and the process I am still going through is through Hemophilia, the french government can give you a permanency if you are exiting your country in the matter of life, the treatment in Brazil it is still under demand which is horrible for joint health in the long run, so I am meeting a council of medics to see my condition, and you can see how the treatment improve my life, idk anyone with this disease that is as active as i am now. Sorry if it is super confuse it still is for me, I am receiving help in all this administrative matter so idk it all. Oh no, thank you very much for this. This seems like a way even i can use. I am sure Brazil has better conditions for hemophilia than here in my country Nepal. Can you please keep me posted on your progress.

And suggestions you can give on starting out? For training it is mostly calisthenics, i do a few Weightlifting but not too much, only like Hammer curls cause they are great to strengthen the muscles around the elbow.\n\n I also started running this last month everyday just bc I wanted to pick up the habit, when the 30 days ends I will cut to 3 runs per week.\n\nI also see working out for Strenght 3 to 4 times a week ideal for hemophilia cause it gives enough time for your joints to heal, before I worked out for Strenght 6x times a week and it was just too much on my joints.\n\nMy diet was pretty bad, i did not eat in variety so i just one day said to myself that i would eat better and added a lot of veggies that is when real aesthetics started to come, you can see in other of my comments in this thread i list most of my nutritious food source so you can base yourself.\n\nLooking forward to start helimbra too if possible.\n\nCheers. Thanks for help. Get on helimbra as fast as possible it is game changer Great stuff man. Do you time Factor intake before lifting? I am 38 also doing bodybuilding. I have damaged left knee/ both ankles are also damaged. However after a leg day, my left knee gets so sore and it makes it difficult to walk next 2-3 days. I actually do not time the intakes, bc I did not felt i needed, as i said i do not go heavy on legs bc of joints, but what I do, i do focusing in mobility and stability with a bit of strength, mostly Bodyweight, take a look at ATG Split Squat, ATG Step Down, and ankle mobility exercises in general and also stretching around the joints you have problem with, helps a lot. Great job! Congrats!! Did you go through rehab? For? They cannot do much for joint damage Actually I had extension issues too but I guess my joints were not completely damaged. I just have to recovery some supination now.\n\nI recommend consulting a physio if you have not My one elbow has been like this for over 20 years. wow u look awesome bud! this is really motivating!! thanks for sharing This was exactly what I needed to see right now, thank you for posting this. I am in a pretty similar situation as you, Type A severe &amp; about to be 22 in a few days. For the past few years I have been trying to grow muscle &amp; it is never really worked out well for me. I have had 2 knee surgeries and a hip surgery in there too so it is made working out consistently a problem. \nI switched over to hemlibra a little over a year ago and I am finally at the point where I am able to work out consistently without getting bleeds as often but I was feeling pretty discouraged. I did not know if it was possible for people like me to get results like this.  I am glad to see a fellow hemophiliac succeeding like this!  I wish you the best of luck on your journey &amp; definitely recommend you try getting on Hemlibra! Amazing! Good for you man. I hope this helps you in the future.

I can not be on a prophylaxis, and I cannot ALWAYS take factor before a workout, would be great if you all can help me. \n\nPs. Would be great if I could connect with some of you guys via social media or discord, snap, insta maybe? Even though you said you cannot be on profie, that would be your best bet. I went from 70 plus bleeds a year before profie to maybe a dozen or so! With Hemlebra (sp) you may only have to dose once a week. Check it out with your hemotologist. My grandson turns 3 and has not had a bleed yet! Hey bro. I wrestle and workout, severe A. Idk how but idk if i bleed or not cause idk how there suppose to feel but ide recomend do soft workout without factor and go allout with it to make the most of it. That Is what i do The only problem is, I really have no prophylaxis programs that I can enroll in right now, when I was on prophylaxis, I got like one bleed in 3 months or so Okay cool :) Hello again, \n\nI am very happy you made some progress on your diet and body. Keep it up.\n\nNow, on what has to do with lifting dumbbells. I have been lifting dumbbells for 6-7 years. i never ever had a single bleeding from it even when i would lift 8-9kg (wrong move i know,it only happened for like a month and i have reduced it to half since then). But you might assume that this is only thanks to always having been on prophylaxis. Well in my opinion there are a couple of other reasons why i have been doing it successfully so here is a couple of things that you should keep in mind:\n\n1. Make sure that you lift very light weights ( at least in the beginning). Ideally you want to feel your arms a bit tired towards the end of the last set ( Last few reps of your exercise).\n2. PLEASE make sure that you are doing the exercise CORRECTLY. Go to someone who is a trainer or someone with experience. It is very important to not put a lot of pressure on your elbow and wrist.\n\nSo i have always had in mind number1 for avoiding muscle/sinew bleedings, and number2 for avoiding joint bleedings.\n\nI do not have huge biceps and triceps and i would be twice as strong after all these years of exercising if i did not suffer from hemophilia. But i have managed to keep my bleedings from it at 0 and i still have some very nice and strong biceps/triceps (People can tell i am working out). Last but not least, the veins in my arms are popping out all the time which is super helpful for when injecting. \n\nI hope i helped a bit. Thanks a lott dude! Yes, I have started dumbbell lifting, and yes, I started it with 2.5 kgs. But the mistake that I made like 3 days ago was to not warm up. That gave me a bleed, after recovery, I will focus on going slow. I want to increase my body strength first then move on to higher intensity workouts. Btw is HIIT helpful/corruptive for hemophiliacs? I have taken a class of aerobics like 4-5 years ago for about a month. I cannot tell you specifics since i have not tried for long enough.  \nBut i would say that if an exercise is not harsh on your muscles/joints then there should not be much of an issue.  \nOne last thing, consider starting swimming. It is by far the safest and most effective form of exercise. After i am done with my surgery and i can walk again, i will start going to a swimming pool gym (i do not know the English term for it). I do not like swimming and i find it a bit boring, but i cannot mentally afford to have another surgery in the future so i will try to maintain minimum stress on my joints.", "uniQure Announces FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for AMT-060 in Hemophilia B ", "Challenges for Women with Hemophilia ", "Gene Therapy Update - Week #10 &amp; #11 I will get straight into the good stuff \n\nOn November 25th my clotting factor was at 186% the doctors told me it would likely fall from there as the steroids were reduced However on the 2nd of December it shot up to 243%\n\nThis was a big surprise for everyone concerned and also a bit concerning!if I hit 250% I have to go on anti coagulation drugs.. oh the irony. \n\nOn the 5th of December my level fell to 200% and then on the 9th December it went to 233% then on the 12th December it shot back up to 247%\n\nThe professor in charge was really surprised as everyone on the trial so far has experienced there highest clotting level while the steroid dose peaks however, I have experienced it when I am almost off steroids.

They leveled off around 15%. Enough to make me a mild. And luckily I never had to have the steroids.\n\nAre the steroids related to the immune system issue or is that something else?\n\nHope you feel better quickly. Thanks!\n\nWould love to hear more about your trial? Where are you based? 15% is right on the border between mild and normal right? \n\nThe abbreviated name of this trial I believe is \u201cGO-8; Haemophilia A gene therapy trial; UCL 13/0076\u201d the full name is \n\n\n\u201cGO-8: Gene therapy for haemophilia A using a novel serotype 8 capsid pseudotyped adeno- associated viral vector encoding Factor VIII-V3\nEudraCT no: 2016-00925-38; UCL Sponsor no: 13/0076; REC reference: 16/SC/0537\u201d\n\nThis trial uses a vector that seems to work faster than a lot of other similar trials. My level on day 2 were up to 7% and I think on week 2 after infusion I was up to 25%\n\nOn week 2 I was put on oral steroids to boost the factor expression and immune suppressants to manage the liver response. They had a hard time managing my immune response initially and they are not sure why but I was quite resistant to Tacrolimus (immune suppressants tablets) I was also on IV steroids for a short time. \n\nThe steroids boost the. Factor expression. So typically you reach a very high level during that time and as the steroids are tapered back so does the factor level before levelling off around the 3 to 6 month mark. Despite being almost off the steroids my levels are really high.\n\nSo far I am the first to be dosed at this high level of concentrate with this vector so they expect my level to level off higher than previous patients. My experience has differed from other patients I have had some bad side effects, I\u2019\u2019be been resistant to the tacrolimus  and I have reached my peak level on  the low end of steroids. Why any of this has happened is unknown! Hopefully it is of some use to the researchers! ( was based out of Philadelphia (US) and I participated out of Boston.\n\nWith this study, factor levels are returning generally lower than other studies like yours and the BioMarin one (BMN-270). Not sure if that was an intentional design decision or a product of the technology, but I am happy with the fact that generally that study is not seeing crazy high factor levels. Anything over 10% as you know is a huge game changer. And this is just my guess, but I am assuming because expression is lower, that there is a corresponding lower rate of liver enzyme activity, meaning less need for steroids. Again, just a guess.\n\nI did not have any liver response so I did not need the steroids. I am pretty happy with 15% as I have had zero bleeds and zero infusions since April 2018. The levels have been pretty consistent month to month. Just curious, but do you think you not having to take factor is related to your ankle pain?  Were you having ankle issues previously when you were infusing?  \n\nFascinating stuff, thanks for sharing Unfortunately not.

I am a pretty classic case; never-ending nosebleeds, massive clots during my period, and I bruise very easily. I thought my symptoms were normal until I met someone else with the disorder.\n\nI am newly married and the plan is to start trying for a baby in the near future. So my first question is for women with children: Did your VWD affect childbirth/recovery?\n\nMy second question is for anyone in the U.S.: How did your diagnosis affect your insurance coverage?\n\nThank you in advance for any responses! I do not have kids, but I do have VWD factor VIII deficiency as well, mine is a bit more milder than yours but my mom has it pretty bad. Make sure you let your baby doctors know about the disease, especially before you give birth. They will probably have you take a nasal spray or do a factor injection prior to just to mitigate the bleeding during childbirth. Also have your child tested for it when they are about 3, especially if you have a girl since it is usually genetically inherited. The testing and medication for all hemophilia types is very very expensive, you will have to call your insurance company for coverage rates and copays and whatnot. But if you get Medicaid almost all costs are covered. I do not really have a definitive answer for costs because it varies on where you live and your insurance coverage. Hi! I have type 3 von willebrands so my circumstances are much different than yours, but I would have a consult with a hematologist before trying to conceive if possible to set up a plan. You will definitely want to have the hospital infuse HumateP  every 12 hours or so while you are in labor if possible. \nMany type 1\u2019s have pretty Normal pregnancies. \n\nAlso be aware that some anesthesiologists will not give epidurals to von willebrands patients. Again you as a type 1 are likely much more mild than some severe cases so probably your anesthesiologists will allow it but something to consider. Also we have a vibrant community on Facebook if you would like details how to connect there Type 1 here, no babies, and not planning on any. Talk to your hematologist and make a plan. Be informed and be safe. \nCannot help you with the insurance question, I am Canadian. I would be interested in this info! I got an epidural but they checked my clot time first. Medicate before birth. Hemorrhages are a danger. Then for your kid, if it is a boy be mindful about circumcision. Have your baby tested. Good luck and god bless \u2764\ufe0f The CDC has a pretty good resource for women with VWD.  Good advice to seek a hematology consult and probably have your baby in a hospital with a perinatal center and in house perinatologists.  Type 1 VWD often gets better during pregnancy, then gets worse right after.  In a center for high risk OB, they would be more easily able to handle your needs in a setting where a hematologist and perinatologist had set up a plan for you ahead of time.\n\nBest to you Oh, wow! I definitely did not know about the epidural. Thank you for your response! Thank you! Thank you for your response! I have insurance through my employer, so I am mostly concerned about my monthly premium, since VWD is considered a pre-existing condition. I appreciate it and would totally take you up on that if I had a Facebook, but Instagram and Reddit are the only social media platforms I use. Thank you!

The only thing is, I have never actually had a spontaneous bleed. Every single time I have had a bleed whether soft tissue or joint, it is always had a cause (my stupidity or accidental). I just wanted to reach out to others affected by hemophilia / parents or guardians of those affected to hear about their experiences. Mostly interested in B but I would love to hear all I have Hemophilia B severe w/ inhibitors and through my entire life I have gotten bleeds for no apparent reason.  I have even gotten a sub dermal hematoma that we could not pin down to any trauma because it seemed to be out of the blue.  But with that said I think as long as you are getting factor consistently you will be more or less okay.  I hope I have help with what you are wondering about! I am on a prophy dose of 2x week Benefix and have not ever had problems with it, sorry to hear about the hematoma. But thanks for your response! I am a severe B and growing up I was having spontaneous bleeds all over the place. My mum always argued I was not getting enough treatment. As I got older I just started dosing myself three times a week as opposed to twice. Never felt better and spontaneous bleeds disappeared. My new centre consultant is quite interested in haemophilia b and factor 9 and after a discussion he agreed with my decision and so my prescription was formally changed. I take 3000 units of benefix, three times a week and it changed so much for me. Ultimately, troughs are shit and I want to spend as little time there as possible  I have severe Hemophilia A w/ a history of inhibitors. Not sure if this is common knowledge or even correct, but i have always found that my spontanious bleeds appear in joints which already have damage to them, like target joints. My target joints are my right knee and right elbow, and 90% of the time that is where most of my spontanious bleeds happen. I have always been on prophy but ever since I switched from dosing every 3 days to every 2 of recombinate, my spontanious bleeding has almost disappeared, so if anyone here has problems with that i would bring up a every 2 day system to your Hematologist if you are not already doing that. I have severe A and get spontaneous bleeds. Specifically in my target joints, and one area on my chest. They are frustrating and annoying, but I find if I stick with my prophylactic schedule they are rare.  A history of inhibitors? Can they come and go? They can! At least with me. From when I was diagnosed til when I turned 5 I had inhibitors caused by having to use human blood product (was living in hawaii at the time when there was a shortage of recombinate). 10,000 units of Factor 8 every day. One day it just went away, and I could dose regularly after that from that point on. Folks using Benefix should ask their doctor if an extended half-life product might be right for you.  I had very few spontaneous bleeds using 100 IU/kg of Alprolix every 10 days.   I was on Alprolix on a 1x a week prophy and had a noticeable increase in bruising. The freedom of once a week was great, but due to how active (student athlete) I am it just was not the right choice for me What dose were you taking?  Did your doctor do a PK study to help determine your dose?\n\nAlso, there are a couple other EHL FIX products that might be worth a try.  I believe they all take different approaches to keeping the FIX protein in circulation. My son has severe hemophilia B. There is always a cause for the bleeds whether it is noticed at the time or not. The physicians here and other facilities we have been to always have us walk backwards in the steps leading up to noticing the bleed, sometimes it was something he did a few days ago slowly building up. Thoughts on switching to Alprolix or Rebinyn? I am afraid I am not the right person to ask, Alprolix did not seem like to right product for me due to my activity level and having seen an increase in bruising on my body. But i do not know your situation and it could be a different situation for you Ah, you have tried Alprolix? My son is on that now and compared to Benefix it is night and day. 1 bleed in 18 months compared to 1 monthly on Benefix. They put the adults here on Rebinyn now because it has an even longer effect and higher peak levels. Maybe look at that if Alprolix was not for you? I have type B severe and i take Alprolix once a week sometimes more if i hurt myself.

For recombinant the price at retail cost is usually $2-5 per unit but it really depends on a lot of things. In some places if you cannot afford to have factor on hand at home the only real solution is to go to an emergency room for a dose which can add another $5000 pretty easily for those costs. Basically it is very expensive while also dependent on what state you are in, the benefits that state provides, your health insurance, assistance programs from the manufacturer, etc. When I took Jivi prophylactically it was 6,500 units twice a week. The cost from the specialty pharmacy to the insurance company was in the ballpark of 115 to 122,000 a month.\n\nEdit: It is worth noting that that is the price after negotiated adjustments between the insurance company and the pharmacy. So there is no further discounts to that total for the insurance company.\n\nEdit 2: Worth mentioning as well that I have private insurance through work and live in Texas. A back-breaking amount without insurance. Manageable with it. Before the ACA, my insurance covered everything and I had just small co-pays for doctors visits and I spent typically a couple hundred dollars a year and the specialty pharmacies were great and learned my ordering patterns and basically refilled my scripts for me. \n\nPost ACA now I pay typically my whole $3200 deductible every year. Only advantage from the ACA was the removal of the lifetime cap although it was basically already going to happen without all the added cost of the ACA. \n\nI am not a proponent of our current Healthcare, especially in my state(CT) as all doctors and care have been bought up by large hospitals who tack on a bunch of extra costs and care only about profits. The government insurance options also carry ridiculous premiums and horrendous out of pocket costs compared to the old options when it was a private market with competition keeping a check on prices. Essentially the government is picking favorites and excusing a rise in cost and removed a lot of negotiating power on prescriptions again rising costs. there are programs by the manufacturer that help with copay..... well at least my HTC has always guided me in the right direction. (California and Oregon HTC)\n\n\nMy current HTC (well my doctor atleast) (kaiser permanente)   does just the minimum... I guess I was being spoiled at other HTCs. I feel like the hemophilia pharmacist cares more..... she actually kept checking up on me after my wisdom teeth removal........ Have not heard from my Hematologist.....\n\n\nanyways sorry. lol. I recommend looking up organizations like HFA ( hemophilia foundation of America) i think. and asking to see if they can help you with copay or atleast guide you.\n\ngood luck \ud83e\udd1e.. This depresses me. Cost of treatment in France = 0. At least we have (\n\nEdit: **/s** I think ( comment was meant for you. Yeah I saw it. They have income caps, and now the current administration is trying to make it so copay assistance will not count towards an out of pocket deductible. The cost of supplies has skyrocketed as well which are not covered under any assistance. Not so true, it is just shuffled into your taxes. Also Americans are footing the bill to offset costs in Europe because we have little to no price negotiating power left due to the ACA. If the US stops subsidizing development and prices are put back in check in the US you will see EU taxes rise to have to account for it. So thank Americans for helping all of the EU's healthcare. Actually not true, yes I pay taxes - but not significantly more than in the US and definitely not as much as private healthcare insurance costs in the US. \n\nThe pharma companies totally rip the US consumers off with pricing (I know, I work for them) that is how they make massive profits - nothing to do with development costs, as do insurance companies who make the system inconceivably complicated with providers networks. \n\nBasically every other \u201crich\u201d nation has a healthcare system that provides virtually free care to patients with bleeding disorders. Except the US. Government Grants subsidize the development so yes that does play into it because that comes back into our taxes, and I touched on the pricing with our negotiating power. The ACA stripped the last bit of negotiating power out and allowed a larger distribution network(mostly owned by foreign interests) to gouge us on pricing. It is a very complex issue though and would take way too long to touch on all the negative aspects or how to address them. I would rather see a free market approach with lots of competition though over a government controlled system. Doctors and Healthcare workers still need to make money and the government will do nothing but skim off the top and ruin any sign of efficiency and quality in the system. Government grants play a part of course. But most of the costs passed on to the US consumer are to appease shareholders, not for drug development. \n\nHonestly. There is no way in hell I would live in the US, entirely because of the healthcare (or rather lack of healthcare) system. \n\nIt is is massively flawed and biased towards rich individuals. What do you do if you cannot afford prophylactic factor in the US? Ration it to emergency use? \n\nThe US is literally the richest country on the planet and it continues to support the wealth of the richest 1% and push as many people as possible into poverty just for the sake of trying to stay alive. Ehh that is a lot of the propaganda speaking. Our last administration who was seen as essentially pure evil had a very in depth plan to address prescription drug costs and it was not even given a chance. \n\nLike I said though very complex and I cannot go into it without writing a book on here. It is not. I have friends and colleagues in the US. It is a lot less complicated here, especially if you are not wealthy. &gt; The ACA stripped the last bit of negotiating power out\n\nCitation needed.  What part of the ACA are you talking about?  And who is it preventing from negotiating drug prices?\n\n&gt; I would rather see a free market approach with lots of competition though over a government controlled system. Doctors and Healthcare workers still need to make money and the government will do nothing but skim off the top and ruin any sign of efficiency and quality in the system.\n\nThe ACA is a government controlled system?  You mean the system that subsidizes people to buy policies from private insurance companies?  Where is the government skimming off the top? &gt; Our last administration who was seen as essentially pure evil had a very in depth plan to address prescription drug costs and it was not even given a chance.\n\nWas this the plan for everyone to inject bleach? It does not include anything about negotiating prices so it is more a lack of wording on the matter. It was not addressed in the Act so it would gain Pharmaceutical companies support. This was set to be addressed even by Obama at first who failed to do so and then Trump made a proposal through executive order and it was shot down. \n\nThe ACA is a marketplace which plays favorites with basically insurance lobbyists deciding what insurance is available to you. Government subsidies have been proven to always increase costs. My mother for example who is retired was forced to take an ACA marketplace option at $680 a month with an $8000 in network deductible, I do not understand how you think that is affordable. Pretty childish there buddy.

I know there\nhas been other topics like that in the past but\nthey were quite old so I thought I will ask anyway :) Hi! I have 5 small tatoos so far. There is no need to worry about it, just be sure to go to a quality saloon, not some shady one. The latter might have poor quality ink and stuff. This would result in a somewhat bad looking tatoo in the following years. \n\nAbout the factor, I would recommend you to do it before you go to the saloon. When you fuse yourself the factor hits instanly (lol), so the later you visit the saloon, the lower your factor levels will be.\n\nAnyways you should be good the go if you fuse yourself right before you leave home. Two hours should also be more than enough but try to lower the waiting period as much as you can.\n\nAfterwards I do not remember using more factor ever. I just went back to my normal schedule, but be sure to take care of your new tattoo. I put Bepanthen on it. Also, try to give your new tattoo as much air as you can during the day, do not have it covered all day long. This will help it heal faster. I always wonder how many bleeders actually inform their tattoo artist of their situation beforehand. I did inform my tattoo artist and I finally found one that is ok with that. I got my first tattoo after a night of heavy drinking and without treating for 4 days prior. (I was meant to be on 3 times a week prophylaxis) I injected about 2 hours after I got the tattoo. I was fine but a bit stupid back In the day. \n\nI have since had a whole sleeve and a bunch of other tattoos. I would treat a few hours before and never really bled too much. You will be fine! Hope you enjoy the experience \ud83e\udd19 I have a lot of work on my arm. Never had any issues. As a matter of fact, stopped infusing after the initial prophy and it seemed like the color stayed better. Perhaps from not scabbing up or something. I do not have any ink but from what I have been told, I think we get about 12 hours of peak clotting from a dose, then it starts to fall off.  That does not mean you necessarily MUST treat within 12 hours of the tattoo, but I probably would the first time just to see how it goes.

So my ankles would bleed and get damaged to a point where I ended up getting rheumatoid arthritis by the time I was 21. I have many thoughts that may or may not be helpful, but here I go. My ankle as well will need to be fused at some point in time. My doctor told me one reason he thought one would wait it out is because things are changing in the field, and things like full ankle replacements are starting to be done. Whether this is a reason to wait it out or not is to be determined I guess. I have a non hemophiliac friend who had his ankle fused for another reason. You would not even know it if you saw him and he says it really only effects him personally minimally. As far as mobility goes. I do construction for a living. I am very active at work. I go through these waves of ankles issues. I have a an issue with it one day, then suddenly I cannot walk for week or weeks or a month. Then, it just stops. Could happen again a month later, could not happen again for six months. Movement and activity is a big part of when it flares up. However, There is something to say about doing some physical therapy, and I do not mean like at the doctor. Stretches, ankle exercise etc. My brother is a hemophiliac as well, he had bad ankle issues long before I did, He was over weight then too. He started exercising, lost a bunch of weight and is still active as far as exercise goes, he does not have any issues anymore really.  Very minor compared to when he was not in shape. An electrician I know, saw me limping for weeks once on a job site, he is a soccer coach on the side as well, he also told me that while he does not know what is wrong with my ankle, that he has seen exercising and PT on areas like this after injuries and what not and seen it do amazing things. He suggested I try 15 min a day of ankle type exercises/PT. So am I doing all of this? Yes and no, many excuses, blah blah blah, busy family, busy life, but I have been trying lately and it does seem to help on certain days when I am having issues. This is something I as well need to start making decisions on if things do not pan out and stay the same. Message me if you want to talk further. Ankle issues are a very real part of my life.  Ankle issues as with other joints are a target problem spot for hemophiliacs. When bleeds occur in that area, it basically destroys the joint over time. In my case, the joint is losing its cartridge around the bone, and bone on bone contact occurs. Leaving no other solution currently but to fuse ankle. I cannot get back that cartilage, nor can it be put in. When you fuse your ankle, the common thought it is that you will be giving up some mobility in the name of no more pain, but as with anything, I think outcome probably varies with different people. I guess ankles tend to be the most common spot because they get the most movement?

I felt like hemophilia didnt affect me because I was active and able to do everything that everyone else was able to do and sometimes better ( or at least I thought I was haha).

They are small enough that a young man would brush it off as nothing but those little aches here and there are the beginning signs that something is wrong.

It is just something I am passionate about. Hope that helps your son. Hi Disspatch,\n\nI have had both my ankles fused, and I can honestly say that they were the most empowering, life-changing events of my life. I am 38, and had the left ankle performed two years ago and the right one two years before that. \n\nThe primary reluctance of the doctors to perform the fusion surgeries is that it is a non-reversible solution to pain and mobility issues. Like you, the doctors were extremely careful in delaying the fusions until all other options had been explored. however, both my ankles had multiple Yttrium injections, cortisone shots and extensive physio, and they had progressed to the point where nothing else worked. Is this the situation that you are in?\n\nWhen you mention that the doctors recommend delaying, are you referring to the Haemophilia Treatment Team, or your average orthopedic specialists? If the latter, i would suggest discussing the issues with the Haemophilia centre instead, and I bet you would receive some other opinions. Fusions are fantastic for pain reduction, and if there is no movement in the joint to begin with, its likely that your mobility will improve after a fusion. From personal experience, i am 100 per cent more mobile after the fusions. That being said, that is a personal experience and yours may differ greatly. \n\nHope that helps. I am travelling southeast asia solo at the moment, which is something i never thought i would have the mobility to do, so my internet access is sporadic. But im more than happy to answer any questions that you have :)\n\nGood luck! Honestly for me if I met someone older who actually had hemophilia telling me how bad it can get if you dont take care of yourself now wouldve changed my mind completely.

It is just something I am passionate about. Hope that helps your son. I agree with all of this.  As a hemophiliac who has also gone through an ankle fusion due to joint degredation, I would like throw in my two cents. Honestly, my only regret is not doing it sooner. Doctors are always hesitant to perform surgery of any kind as the is always an inherent risk with that. I managed to hold off until I was 29 before doing mine and that was one of the dumbest decisions I have made. At the end of my ankle's usefulness, I could barely walk to steps before the pain was unbearable. It was still painful for a long time after the operation, but that was for other reasons that I will not get into (not related to the arthritis or the operation). Usually after about 6 months you are good to go. After my pain levels let up, I am sooooo much more mobile than I was before. I can be more active with my kids and enjoy going for walks again. &gt; Honestly, my only regret is not doing it sooner.\n\nFucking Amen to this\n over 40.   I walked on a cane because of how painful my ankle got.  Then, I had a breakdown and threw my hesitations in the wind, and one of the best decisions I have made.\n\nKeep in mind, the rehab is BRUTAL.   But, if you have decent sized feet, and good range of motion with your feet joint, you will walk completely normal.   I am still able to take short little 'sprints' if I need to.    I will never run again, but I walk without pain, where I did walk with a cane.\n\nDo it. The doctor from the bone department wanted to fuse my ankles when I was referred to them from haemato way back. In the end, based on talking to people, I changed my footwear and now rarely have ankle issues.\n\nMy shoes have been perfectly flat after that.

", "Wondering about Hemlibra and what it does?Been doing framing work at home the past few days...  I see many questions about how well Hemlibra works or what it does. Just general curiosity really... So let me share a bit of story from today.\n\nTitle says most of it. Been reframing to repair some water damage. Got more fatigued than i realized and made some dumb mistakes. \n\nThe one was a nice and SOLID hammer strike of the webbing between my left thumb and forefinger. Got a bit of the muscle in that space as well... I know I am just a mild but before Hemlibra a similar blow would already be livid and red, swollen as hell, stiff and PAINFUL.  I have full motion, a smallish blood blister and will likely have a small bruise. Does not feel too bad and all things not too damn bad. \n\nThe forefinger on the other hand was a strike on that knuckle. Mostly pinched it. Hurt like hell and like hought it was going to swell. It barely has a red mark now. Only the faintest indication I hit it. \n\nThe last was a minor knick. I did not even notice it until I went to take pics of the other injury. It never bled. \n\nTHAT is what Hemlibra does!\n\nNow it is not perfect. Actual active bleeds still require clotting factor. But it DOES work! In fact, considering the hand got hit with a freaking HAMMER you may notice a box of clotting factor in the background. Lol. That is what is up next. Thought the community might like the story. I know I had a million questions, and a lot of skepticism. Nice! I am wondering what your normal factor levels are! I am a mild and it never even crossed my mind that Hemlibra would be an option for me. What are these pictures showing? Read my comment. It covers everything. But the short version is several hammer strikes caused by fatigue. I would also love to hear about your expeias a mild on hemlibra. How did you make the decision to use it? I am a mild on an ehl product I have two end stage ankles. Both have pretty severe osteoarthritis. Conversations between the Hematologist, Orthopedist, and my own explanation of how my bleeds, pain, and swelling occur and it was basically felt that the joints themselves were in such poor shape that they may we will be causing bear constant bleeding inside. Hemlibra is a much more consistent form of prophylaxis. Once you finish your loading doses it is is always in your blood at a consistent level. No peaks and troughs like recombinants. Also, it is VASTLY cheaper than. Clotting factor. Which, for me was a concern. I work for a school district that self pays insurance. Over the course of a year the post deductions cost to my plan for clotting factor is ~1.5mil. That is the actual plan cost, so, what the district is responsible for. While it is likely the district has a catch all catastrophic plan for it is expenses it bothered me that my care could potentially effect insurance cost in a big way. It just bothered me. So, Hemlibra armed most likely to take care of my issue, and also save about a million dollars a year. Also, one sub-q/wk versus 2 iv inj/wk... Yeah. \n\nIt ticked all the boxes to make it worth trying. \n\nAfter trying it... I am on month 2 and wondering if this is what normal people feel like? I do not have unexplained bruises anymore. I do not worry about my knee when I bump a random thing. My ankles will hurt... But I can rest them and actually experience RECOVERY. If I take a small break they recoup a bit and I can walk some more. \n\nI understand not all of this will work for every hemophiliac. Being mild is its own thing, the arthritis is its own thing, that I get. But these are my own experiences. How strongly.do i feel about my Hemlibra? I have, apparently, a mild allergy to it. I get injection site itching and redness. I would rather deal with that, dose, and take benadryl then even pause to consider going back to factor prophy. I am like... 6%? It is just on this side of moderate. When I was younger I was just under and was thus a moderate. Apparently some change can happen. But in my case was about a percentage point. /Shrug. \n\nApparently Hemlibra is not an option to all of us regardless. Some countries only allow it for severed, or for those with inhibitors. I would guess even where it is allowed different hematologists view it differently as well. I am not sure. What I can say is that nothing happens if you do not ask and advocate. Good luck!", "Can haemophiliacs get circumscribed? Hey guys Type A less than 1% here, I was curious about the aftermath of circumcision of haemophiliacs, we had been hearing the benefits of circumcision over the years and I am seriously considering it as a must for all, any of you guys have this experience? That is how my parents discovered I have hemophilia.  Oh I am definitely no expert but I think circumcision and it is \u201cnecessity\u201d is far more cultural than medical.  There are some benefits but proper washing up should mitigate most downsides.  That being said, I do know someone who got an infection in their late teens and had to be circumcised.  Circumcision in adulthood sounds just plain horrible...\n\nFun fact: The Talmud has an exclusion for circumcising boys if two of their siblings died of bleeding. I can imagine getting a swelling on the pp, that is the reason I made this post before dumbly asking a haematologist Anecdotal evidence but my husband is in his 40s, type B severe and has never had such an issue.  He is not circumcised. \n\nWhat did the haematologist say? Same here! Glad I do not remember it lol If you have access to plenty of factor than I imagine it would be fine. But what are these benefits you speak of? It can lead to decreased sensitivity/sexual pleasure. If I could uncircumcise myself I would lol I am a hemophiliac and I was circumcised when I was 27. I had not been diagnosed with hemophilia at the time and I remember it taking a bit longer to heal than I had been originally told, but otherwise it was ok. As the operation does not go through and major blood vessels, the risk of haemorrhage is low, though you should definitely get the opinion of your Urologist. I went through a lot of back on forth on this for my kid on whether to snip or not with a couple doctors when he was born. \n\nThe \"benefits\" are extremely minimal, debated and come with a cost as well. I mean it is your body, so it is your decision, with social stigma about not being chopped in some places being heavy, I can understand. Just be weary there is a ton of misinformation about it, and I would suggest highly researching it.\n\nCircumcision was mainly done bc religious folk believed masturbation was a sin, and caused insanity, and reducing pleasure from it, would help deter men from doing it, and \"save\" them from going to Hell.\n\nSo shit tons of propaganda was spread about it by folks like Kellogg(yes the cereal maker, who also said buying his corn flakes would save ppl from going insane and going to Hell as well) Same here. 8 day gang 8 day gang 8 day gang Yo i had mine when i was about 7 years old and it went smoothly with no bleeding afterwards.

I used to worry the same thing even left a few times early on so I would not hold them back. If i have one piece of advice id say talk to your friends. I did and they did not care at all, they just wanted to see that stuff with me and if i was not there they would not of had as much fun. Hearing that from them really helped open my mind up. Your friends are inviting you out to do things even though you may slow them down because they love you and want to share life with you. they do not mind slowing down cause you are an awesome person. Remember that, and if someone gives you shit for holding them back. screw them, they are not worth your time if they cant be a little empathetic. But seriously talk to your friends about it if its bothering you. Guarantee they will say the same and hopefully put your mind at ease like my friends did for me so many years ago.

What is your experience? How long have you been on it? Any complaints or other observations? Thanks in advance! Edit: Also, do you live an active/physical lifestyle? Not currently on Jivi myself (still on kogenate), but the best thing you can do, if at all possible, is ask if you can have a PK (pharmacokinetic) study done on kovaltry and another one done on jivi. That would give you very specific information about how well the product works for you, and you could figure out if there would be any improvement in your factor levels or number of infusions. Theoretically jivi should have a longer half-life, as the pegylation prevents your body from clearing the product as easily, which should mean your factor level is higher for longer after you infuse. Unfortunately, the increase in half life has been pretty variable from patient to patient, so the actual benefit you see may not be worth it. Additionally, there is some concern about pegylation long-term, as though it is safe in the drugs it is currently a part of, none of them are designed to be taken for years and years like factor is. Overall if you are happy with your current treatment regimen, both with regards to number of pokes and number of bleeding episodes then I would probably not switch myself. If you are interested in reducing the number of pokes or bleeds I would ask them if a PK study would be feasible. Anytime a new factor hits the market I become captain skeptical. I have a VERY high metabolism and I feel like that has something to do with my factor levels over time. After changing so many factors over time and not seeing the results explained to me, I take more time to find out what is worth it. I hate having to stick myself so much but Kovaltry does well at eradicating bleeds (from minor ir serious trauma). I will look into the pharmacokinetic line to see if its worthwhile to switch. I appreciate your input! What are the reasons your HTC has given you for switching? Longer half-life, dosing once a week as opposed to 2-3 What would happen to the pegylation?

It sounds like the last time your parents heard anything about it was probably back in the 80s during the aids crisis. Most of us are used to having to explain what it is to ER drs and nurses if we go to a new hospital. On the one hand it is great that more people do not have it, making rare to the point that many health care professionals have only read about it briefly in text books. On the other hand it also causes many people to be very misinformed about what living with it actually entails these days. \n\nYour boyfriend having a bleeding disorder has zero affect on your day to day life (barring any major accidents), and even less on theirs. It sounds like they are just against you dating him period, and this is just another talking point rather than an actual concern. If you think he is a good person and having him in your life improves it, then keep doing what you are doing. You can try to educate them if they are receptive, but sometimes facts just cannot trump emotion if someone has already made up their mind. And sometimes we just have to live with our parents being idiots. Hopefully that does not turn out to be the case for you. Best of luck navigating this. Thank you for answering. I really do hope my parents come around and realise how stupid they are being Building on what was said above. Back in the 80's-90's during the AIDS crisis people with hemophilia still got treatment via blood transfusions and as a result many hemophiliacs were diseased because of it. (In Canada it is estimated that as many as 70% of hemophiliacs contracted Hepatitis C or HIV/AIDS). Since then treatment has transitioned to being nearly entirely synthetic and thus there is no longer a risk of contracting a disease via treatment. Your parents may not know this which may be part of the reason why your boyfriends bleeding disorder may scare them. Think of it this way in terms of how much people know about hemophila.\n\nAverage person: \u201cwut? I have never herd of that, did you say homophilia?\n\nReasonably well educated person: \u201coh the royals disease\u201d\n\nGeneral doctor: \u201cI read a paragraph on it back in med school once\u201d\n\nGeneral Hemotologist(typically just Oncologist): \u201cI read a chapter on that back in med school once\u2026. I should probably brush up on that\u2026\u201d\n\nHematologist specializing in Hemophilia: \u201cwould you like to see all the books and studies I have published on the topic?\u201d\n\nSo, sorry to say, even though they are doctors they do not know shit, and probably feel like they cannot be educated by a lay person about something in the medical field. Trust me, I deal with doctors like that all the time ** \u201cLook at me, I am the doctor now\u2026. When it comes to hemophilia\u201d A fellow Brit here. \n\nThe fact that your parents have been against your relationship from the start says it all. This is just another bit of ammo to split you two up. I also find it quite shocking that they are so ignorant about what haemophilia is given their professions - perhaps it is wilful ignorance. \n\nFurther, as a parent myself I would not want to fall out with my daughter because she is dating someone with a medical condition\u2026.If you developed a medical condition would they push people away from you? I doubt it. \n\nLive your life and make your own decisions about your love life - they should be perfect in your eyes not theirs. As long as you are being treated with respect by this person I would not worry. \n\nFYI I told my wife a couple of months into our relationship. Her parents worry about me if anything accepting me with all of their love.\n\nStand your ground. If they put your love for you first they will in time admit they were wrong. This may as well be gospel. Absolutely spot on. \n\nOP, ignore them if you are so inclined. Living with hemophilia is not the terrible sentence it used to be. Also, shame on your parents for being doctors of medicine and writing off someone with an incurable disease.. I am sure an ethics board would look down on that. Yes that is the frustrating thing, just because they are doctors they seem to think their opinion is more valid no matter how much I tell them that treatments have advanced over the years. Honestly so frustrating. Yeah you would think if anything, they would be more understanding There is no reason being in a long term relationship with someone with hemophilia should be any different than anyone else. Sounds like maybe your parents do not like they guy and are trying to use any excuse to get you away from him? As doctors they should know better than to pull the \u201cdo not date a handicapped person\u201d card. That is pretty lame of them. I have to assume they are smarter than that and they have other motives. Besides that hemophilia really is not that big of a deal for a partner to deal with. Besides him possibly having learned to be more sensitive and caring of others. It is a baseless argument to not date someone. That is what I am hoping for. I am hoping over time they will realise how happy he makes me. My mum is just ruining the relationship between her and I for a completely silly reason. It baffles me but I have met more less than understanding doctors then I ever thought I would come across... Hello,\n\nSince you have been together for two years, i am assuming you have experienced many of the difficulties that come with living with haemophilia. I am guessing those difficulties are not a reason for you to break up with him. If you love him and he loves you i would say do not listen to anyone. Your parents probably have other reasons to be against your relationship.\n\nA relationship with mutual feelings should not break because of trivial reasons. I am assuming your boyfriend is very strong facing haemophilia and he puts up a good fight.  \nSee, i am hesitant to get into a normal-dedicated relationship. I have many worries that were caused because of haemophilia such as injection trauma from an incident in my childhood that makes me mentally suffer when injecting (I am 21 years old now), psychosomatic pains after it is been over 36 hours after my injection(i think it is a mental thing. I feel pain in my ankles even though i have no bleeding or anything.), i do not know yet if want to have kids because if it is a girl i will pass her my X chromosome, and a lot of other worries about the future that i will not say here because it is not relevant with the post.\n\nAll those things make me not want to start dedicated relationships because i do not want to make any girl have to carry my own problems. But if a girl told me that she does not care about those difficulties i am facing and that she is in love with me and i also felt the same way, i would not want that to go away. Hemophilia is a smokescreen for them of deeper issues. For them to be physicians and not to have looked at treatment now is willful ignorance and selective bias. Also incredibly WWII style genetic discrimination. Have they disclosed their health conditions to your boyfriend? I mean he might have to help you take care of them one day and he deserved to know earlier  how awful their ignorance may affect his life from day one lol...wish you the best. Most doctors seem to know very little about hemophilia in my experience. Nothing against doctors but it is a specialized field that does not require their attention so they are nearly as ignorant as the general public.  It seems like they have other issues with your boyfriend and they are using this to try and separate you two.  Most people in my life have no idea I have hemophilia, even friends I have had for 20 years do not know.  Him not telling you right away is not unusual.  Once your relationship got serious he shared the information so I do not see that as a problem either.  Medical science is changing fast these days so concerns for you children (more accurately your grandchildren) are not really an issue in my opinion.  There are things to consider for yourself.  Your female children could possibly be carriers which means there is a chance their children could have hemophilia.  With modern treatment changing for the better and things like CRISPR, it is a non-issue in my opinion but something to consider long-term if you are considering children.  He is going to have some physical issues eventually which may lead to anything from a short temper/agitation to severe depression and anything in between.  Or maybe nothing that you would notice, and plenty of people without hemophilia have those and plenty of other issues.  I know I am not the easiest person to get along with because of my physical discomfort but my wife seems able to handle it and she is been putting up with my nonsense for over 20 years now.  Nobody's perfect and as long as you are aware of what to expect, it is your life and your decision.  Life is hard and I am sure your parents just want to help steer you towards the easiest path but you cannot control your heart. I am sorry they have put you in a situation where you have to choose one or the other but maybe educating them will help.  They would probably do better to talk to a hematologist but there is plenty of information available online if they are interested in facts.  Your life partner is going to be the most important person in your life.  More than parents, siblings, and even your potential children so you cannot let anyone dictate who you are or are not with.  I hope they come around for your sake but that is secondary to your choice.  Sorry for rambling.  Best of luck to you. Type A, Severe here.\n\nI would like to try to give you a more pragmatic response than some of the other hemos here.\n\nI do not necessarily blame your parents for their reaction. A little bit of knowledge can be a lot more dangerous than a total lack of knowledge. Any good parent is going to want to protect their little boy or little girl from a life that can be wrought with trials, sources of anguish, things that a person may not *have* to deal with in their lives. It sounds like your parents care about you very much.\n\nYour parent's are not wrong, your boyfriends hemophilia **will** have an impact on your life at some point, or at multiple points, throughout the duration of your (hopefully lifelong) relationship.\n\nIt may impact decisions he makes, things he can/cannot do, ways he can help around the house or raising children, or maybe even have an impact on your sex life. Not all the time, it sounds like he is pretty compliant with his meds, not every day or even every week, but it will happen. The thing is, you have already spent 2 years with him, gotten to know him and some of his habits and, thus far, it does not seem to have had a major impact on how you feel about him or how your life has been in his presence.\n\nI am 35 years old. In my youth people (in the USA at least) did not take their medication prophylactically. Insurance would not cover it. This came about later, and it took me quite some time to become compliant. I am sharing this to help you understand where I am coming from when I comment. I am not 100% even when I am feeling my best. I still go to concerts, work long days, have fun with my friends, take vacations, etc. But I also will never go snow boarding, I have chosen to never have children (as a way to not pass on my gene), or avoid going to Disneyland (though I may just be using my disease as an excuse to avoid an explicitly unpleasant experience. I hate Disneyland...)\n\nBut you know what else? I would never begrudge my partner for wanting to go snowboarding. I will happily sit in the lodge and day drink while she has fun with friends. If she wants kids? Let us talk adoption, or getting a donor. Ultimately it is about how he treats you, the compromises you both make, and building a life with both of your needs in mind.\n\nMy personal opinion? Educate your parents more. I hate to hear that you are not speaking with your mother over this and, while it sounds like there may be some other problems they may have, education can help here better than anything else.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit - Added Hemophilia type and severity. No dis respect to the parent but regular doctors that arnt hematologists are so stupid when it comes to hemophilia, it is like having a 5th grader do a book report off of the book that was turned into film. Idk like blood transfusions? Doc it is ok to exit the 1950s. But also you should get tested to see if you are a carrier because if your not then your kids cannot get it so there is no threat there either. Thanks for commenting! Yes, I have made them aware of this and hat treatment has progressed from blood transfusions but they still come to terms with the fact he has Haemophilia - so frustrating! That is what I thought, it should not be different to being in a relationship with anybody else. Anybody could develop health conditions in their life This is what I told them - does this mean everyone now has to map out their genetics for their potential partners? So stupid Thank you for your honest opinion, I really do appreciate it! I have tried educating them about haemophilia and it is progression in treatment over the years, but they always find something to back their concerns! \n\n(PS, I also hate Disneyland!) This really resonates with me as the partner of a person with severe hemophilia and similar circumstances re: treatment.  He is now on prophylaxis but has hemophiliac arthropathy in some joints from childhood bleeds. \n\nThe day to day impact of hemophilia seems minimal but in reality we have adapted our lives to it.  I love skiing and we used to go on ski trips but we always knew he could only do 1-2 days max of activity and had to rest the third day. As we have gotten older, we have made a conscious decision to stop skiing. It means when we go on vacations we have to have breaks throughout the day because he cannot walk 8 hours and not be in pain the next day. It means sometimes the things we want to do are not possible because he is in pain. He also is concerned about passing the gene onto the next generation and we have chosen not to have kids (for reasons other than this but we certainly discussed it). I hate needles but I have learned to give him infusions.\n\nIs this a dealbreaker? Absolutely not. But it will impact your life and as OP said, your parents want to protect you from that. \n\nFWIW, my parents were wary at first and feared that I would be a widow at an early age. I have tried educating the, a bit but over time they have seen it does not severely limit my life and it is a non-issue. As other posters have said, it sounds like they have many reasons they dislike him other than hemophilia - those may be the key ones to tackle.\n\nEDIT: Also when we considered having children, we also discussed screening for genetic disorders and what we would do if results were positive. It is truly amazing how much some people (even Medical Doctors) have no idea about Hemophilia. They have not given blood transfusions for bleeds since probably the 60's or 70's lol. There is absolutely no reason to break up with this man because of the bleeding. You guys can live a fully functional and happy relationship. The only thing is that bleeding episodes can impede on everyday life, ruin planned events, or possibly even hospital stays depending on the severity of the bleeding. So you will definitely have to \"accept that\" in order to be with him.   \nNow with current generation medicine, bleeding will more than likely become less and less common for hemophiliacs. My Hematologist started me on a new medicine called Hemlibra, and it is amazing thus far. I have not bled since i started it a month or so ago. So, your BF could potentially get on that medicine as well, and would hopefully do well with it. \n\nGood luck! We bleeders are keepers! &lt;3 My five month old child just started Hemlibra. He is severe type A and, for us, it is given us a lot of hope as new parents! I agree with a few of the comments I saw about the aids crisis and problems of the hemophilia in the past and just a personal experience when I started dating with my gf were friends at first mind you and told her about my bleeding disorder and did not bring it up as much thanks to new medicine like hemlibra but if she was curious or had questions I would do best to simplify and brief it for her than what she heard about in 7th grade bio so as time went on she understood it more and more and when she told her parents about my hemophilia they were very approved about our relationship and understood what I had going on with me I know this is not relatable for anyone but my best advice is too tell them that they barely gotten a chance to know the guy and to give it time to get to know and understand your boyfriend medicine has indeed advanced for hemophiliacs in the past 20 years hopefully your parents will understand and accept your relationship Hi! I am late to the party but I wanted to chime in and provide a similar perspective.  My husband has hemophilia (severe) and when my parents found out they were concerned for what it would mean for me in the long term. \n\nAside from the outdated concerns regarding blood products, they were also misinformed about how hemophilia would affect him later in life. They were under the impression that I would not have a \"normal\" relationship, or be able to do \"normal\" things with him because of it. Yeah, he has bad days where we cannot walk the dog together, or where I have to mow the yard because he should stay off his feet, but I do not think that makes us have less of a relationship. \n\nHe is always felt that his hemophilia does not define who he is or how he lives his life, and it is the same in our relationship. As long as he listens to his HTC team and does his meds when he should, it is basically the same as being in a relationship with someone who has a more common medical condition like high blood pressure - we are aware of it, but manage it with minor changes.\n\nI would suggest talking to your parents and asking them why they feel hemophilia makes him less worthy of a relationship. If they are open to it, it may be worth having them discuss it with your boyfriend there as well, since his checkups have probably prepared him with answers to the concerns they have. Thanks so much for your response. Yes, this is how I feel - he may have bad days sometimes but for the most part I do not feel like it affects our relationship", "Need some advice Hello guys I am 20 years old with severe A with ES-education, I get my infusions for completely free and I inject myself after every other day. I usually get knee/elbow bleeds once a month or when I run out of medication. \n\nAfter elementary school I went to college, in where I lasted 1 month living on campus and taking busses to hopistal for infusions. The first bleed after a month in college was also my last because I dropped out.In retrospect I think I wasnt mentally ready to handle the challenges and Im not sure If I am even now 2 years later.\n\n\n\nLast 2 years have really been a game breaker for me because I was in some denial/depression for awhile to a degree of ignoring medication, which led to muscle loss thus weaker joints. \n\nSince then Ive picked myself up and started working out, low impact like cycling led to making home-made weights.Latter is a hit and miss because it causes bleeds for me, its a learning curve what I can/cant lift but all in all It makes my muscles stronger and doesnt seem to put (much) strain on my joints.\n\nI would also like to add that Im in no way mad at myself, the condition or the state of living im in right now.If anything I appreciate what I got and try to learn from every experience.\n\n\n\nThere are some questions though that I cant ask from anyone else but other hemophiliacs\n\nMy main concern is that Im 20 years old with elementary school education, I dont know what to study so what are your careers/jobs?\n\nAlso I think I stopped going to my hemophiliac meeting 10 years ago, we just kind of lost touch. I try to look into it again, but do you guys still have hemophilia meetings in your countries?\n\nHaving no education is really a bummer for me because I want to learn some skills.\n\nSecondly I dont have a job and at times it even seems unrealistic to get one. It really puts a strain on me from time to time, not because I compare my begging to someone elses middle its just the challenge Id like to face.\n\n\nI can see education as a possibility and Im hopeful regards that, but its a two edged sword because I want my education to lead me to having a job.\n\nIf you are wondering how I make a living being 20 with no job and education then the answer is I dont.\nRecently I inherited some land, which lead our family to buying a house having an apartment already. Which gives me a place to live without paying rent.\n\nI get enough disability benefits for food and also to pitch in on the bills.\nBut as with everyone sometimes you got to spend more then what you need to stay alive, to feel good physically and mentally.\n\nI tried to make this thread as positive as I can because honestly im pretty positive about the future, but my writing skills might not translate what I feel so sorry for that.\n\nIf I realize that Im not cut out for working in the future I will try to find some volunteer work and help around the house as much I can.Im not looking for career options from you guys even though it might sound like it.I just feel like im writing the first chapter of my life and I got no ideas what to write about, therefore I want to hear your stories.\n\nSorry for bad grammar and all around poor-writing, I want to share my story but I dont know how to elaborate it.\n\n\n\n\n", "Hemophilia and Sports Hi, I suffer from moderate Hemophilia A, my fv viii % is close to 7% i think, and  i do not compete in any sport but I do practice a lot and like to think that i have pretty good performance overall for my joints condition, i would like to know if there are many more hemophilics who try to balance with sports and how you have been dealing with it so far, i do calisthenics, gymnastics, capoeira and started running recently. I prefer sports with low-impact such as biking, swimming, hiking. mild (\\~10). Played basketball competitively during my teenage years and university life. Had to take treatment every \\~3 months due to twisting the ankle or getting elbowed too hard. In the UK, I was always encouraged to continue even with the frequent injuries, as they said that the overall benefits in fitness/joint health make it worth it. Later, in France and the US, the specialists always said \"you should stop\". I now live in France and my doctor too tells me to stop, I am 22 in a few days. And did you had occasional bleeding caused by it ? I am severe and 21 . Before Covid I would have no problem football training 2 days a week and playing matches . Sure you get bleeds but if you have  access to good factor there is absolutely no point In stopping in my opinion. Hi! I am severe type A and I do combat sports. Specifically HEMA (historical European martial arts). Guess I am a HEMAphiliac haha. We study and fight with longswords, sabers, rapiers, spears, etc...I get bruises but no major injuries. I am lucky to have insurance which allows me to infuse 3x per week. I also infuse before fighting. If you have access to factor, do not let hemophilia hold you back! Do what you love and have fun :) I ran, played soccer and baseball and was overall pretty active as a teenager and that was when prophy treatment was not yet the standard. I had better luck than most but the bleeds I DID have were rough. I have torn the same psoas three times, a shoulder I landed on roughly in soccer has limited range of motion and one ankle technically is diagnosed with synovitis but it is doing pretty well all things considered.\n\nOnce I hit my mid-20s the string of good luck and youthful recovery left in a hurry. I cannot do any of the things I mentioned above unfortunately, and I love running. I stick to elliptical machines and bikes and weightlifting. I do not regret too much but I do wish I had been smarter about quitting earlier - I just kept thinking I could bounce back like I did when I was 17. I am severe and 30, so a bit older but I participated in track (sprints and jumps) and swimming. I eventually had to let the track go because of ankle issues. I also developed a target elbow when I was younger but that was due to tackle football during recess.\n\nMy recommendation would be low impact sports that have already been suggested like biking, swimming, hiking, etc. but some more moderate or high impact sports could be an options from time to time if you treat accordingly and talk to your med team and physiotherapists Idk man, you are so young. Treatments are getting better. Stay in shape and keep at it, wether at a competitive level or just for your own well being, it is worth it to stay in shape. I am severe A , 45yrs old. I have stayed away from high impact stuff , but have always ridden bmx (half pipes and tracks) cycling, skateboarding, motorcycles (street and trail riding) yoga and swimming. Anything I can do to keep active and have fun. But as soon as I am hurt I stop and let myself heal all the way. And I infuse heavily. I think the more active you are able to be , within reason, the less problems you will have. But it is so important to know when to stop and recover from a bleed. Sometimes it takes a while, so I could see how competitive or organized sports would be really hard to keep up with. That is interesting. I bounced back again and got a second wind in my 40\u2019s. I am in better shape now than I ever have been. I think it sometimes takes the right combination of things, exercise, medicine, discipline, and luck. Try not to let expectations limit you tho. I never thought I would be where I am now. I have been hurt so bad , so many times for so long, dealt with severe atrophy, all kinds of shit. And now it is like it never existed. Just keep at it and be smart and persistent. You never know what your body is capable of. I am 23 and moderate (3%), and have never stopped playing sports and staying active. You are fine as long as you are fit and are consistent with your medication. Just understand that recoveries for us Haemophiliacs is just that bit longer and do not push yourself too far and make sure you warm up/stretch etc. Know your limits Yo yo, Severe A 26 year old male less than 1%\n\nI am trying to get back to being more active. When I was in high school I lifted weights with the football team because weight lifting was offered as a class. Not many bleeds, but they did happen. I just took the extra time to heal up. To be honest, though, I only dosed as needed rather that prophylacticly, and I would stretch but did not really ice my joints afterwards. I trained in Krav maga and MMA for a little while, no worse for wear. I will say that I felt the best, physically, when I was active in the gym and on the mat.\n\nAt present, its tough for me to workout or do much besides walk. Running causes bleeds, my muscles strain easily, my ankles injure easily.. its tough. \n\nMy best advice is whatever athletics you do make sure to stretch your muscles and ice your joints after every excercise. Make sure you dose when you need to and do not be afraid to take a little more time to heal up than a \"normal\" person would. ALWAYS keep proper form in mind no matter what you do because that is a key point in preventing injury. I agree! I am also a 19 year old severe type A and am fortunate enough to have factor. Throughout high school I played volleyball, basketball, soccer and ran frequently. As long as you listen to your body, do not over do it and stretch, having an active lifestyle is possible I got joint bleeds/hematomas in both knees when I ran a half marathon so I would be careful with running. Maybe keep your distance lower, and infuse factor before you run? Or at least watch out for signs of a joint bleed  Damn, you are able to run HM ? That is incredible, can you share a bit of how was your journey to get to this point. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c sorry man i really do not recommend it. It took almost two years to walk without pain after this (maybe someone else has a better experience!) I think there is lots of other sports/exercises that are safer for my body though!  Have you thought about joining a swim team? Follow this dude on Instagram   or his business page  \nHe is a weight lifter type person and has hemophilia Not really, but i might look into it, thanks for sharing anyway Well to be honest your ideas so far seem great! Capoeira and calisthenics especially!! For gymnastics: maybe consider a wrist brace for impact? Just an ideas\nBut honestly I think your original ideas sound pretty good! Maybe just be ready to infuse factor if things go south Oh and I will not lie. Walking is all I have been doing lately too \ud83d\ude0f hoping to get a weight routine at some point .... Thanks man, I have been really enjoying those  but i would like to work on endurance as well, but i might keep running short distances like 5 to 10k max fo keep joint bleeding under control I give him a follow right  away That sounds like a good goal! Keep us posted! It is really helpful to learn from others in similar situatio Well my current 5k PR is 22'55\" if you are interested,  have not done a 10k yet, still building up to it. Depending on the sport, you will have to keep an eye out for any internal bleeds or severe bruises. You can basically do anything you would like, just as long as you are careful", "Any experiences with CBD oil? Does it affect use of Advate? I have been researching a bunch and would like some experiences from fellow hemophiliacs. I have a bunch ofankle and hip issues I would like to use it for It is not going to affect bleeding or change the way Advate works. You probably will not find many drug interaction with CBD and prescription drugs, partly because CBD is not really a drug and partly because it has not been studied enough. But a lot of things are not studied much because they are not assumed to have drug interactions. Plus the mechanism in which CBD works is unrelated to how Factor 8 works. It will not hurt you to try it. I recommend smoking the flower, or putting 25mg of oil under your tongue. I do not really have an opinion as a hemophiliac if it helps my pain. But it is helpful in other ways. Mainly for me it helps distract me from the mood brought on by pain. But I think those things can tie in together so I guess it does help with pain some.

I was anticipating another knee surgery or a hip surgery when I first came across CBD oil. I had previously used opioids and a lot of other pain management alternatives and have never found anything that helps as much as CBD. I started using it twice a day, under the tongue and did not really notice too much of a change for the first week or two. It was not until after the first month where I woke up and was able to walk without being in agony and suddenly my knees could tolerate stairs a lot more. After using it faithfully for a few months, I no longer need to take it every day and my pain is near nonexistent. Hope it helps you as much as it helped me! Congrats! Happy to hear that. Which branded CBD oil do u use? &gt;You probably will not find many drug interaction with CBD and prescription drugs, partly because CBD is not really a drug and partly because it has not been studied enough.  But a lot of things are not studied much because they are not assumed to have drug interactions. \n\nThat is not right.\n\nCBD inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4.  CYP3A4 is responsible for metabolizing like half of all drugs so CBD could interact with a lot of meds.\n\nIt will not interact with Advate because Advate is not like other drugs because it is a protein and not a small drug-like molecule like CBD. I see. At least I was partly right? Yea, do not take internet advice at face value. I take a lot of meds, Advate included and there are no interactions with any of them, is what I should have said. The rest was me assuming. Helps with my joint pain. Went nerdy and made a flavor mix that I only use during bleeds. I call it  \" Walter white\" ( heisenberg + CBD).\n  But to the point, no it wont effect factor. It does not affect anything with your factor I personally use THC to help deal with my pain. have a knee replacement and elbow replacement and I am still in my 20s", "Von Willebrand\u2019s and completely useless hematologist I am just pissed off beyond words right now.

He ignores my messages and passes it to his nurse. Even his nurse forgets to reach out to me.\nI do not know what the fuck to do and I am fucking fed up. Look up your state medical board and file a complaint. I am sorry this is happening to you. I have been there. It fucking sucks. I have had some luck with having an IUD. My periods are typically 12 to 20 something days long and I bleed through a super overnight tampon and super overnight pad combo about every 45 minutes, to the point I have needed to seek emergency medical intervention. It fucking blows. With the IUD, my periods have all but stopped. Sometimes I spot for a few minutes at the start but beyond that, very little bleeding. However, I do cramp much much worse and have had to ahve surgery to have the IUD removed once before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, contact the National Hemophilia Foundation. They can put you in contact with an advocate. Get a doc who has other patients with VWD. If you have not already, find a hematologist who deals exclusively with bleeding disorders. We had similar problems with our early hematologists because they were hematologist/oncologist and just did not have the specific experience to be good with bleeding disorders. \n\nIt might be a bit of a drive from where you are, but find your nearest hemophilia treatment center and switch to that hematologist\n \n\nNo medical professionals ever told us that there were specific national centers for bleeding disorders and it took us years before accidentally finding out on some Facebook group randomly. The difference in standard of care is enormous and worth the long drive once a year for a checkup, the rest we can do over the phone with the super human care coordinator who works there.\n\nAnd, as a side gripe, my sister in law has had a non-HTC hematologist tell her that women cannot have hemophilia (despite her test results). These outdated medical opinions are still out there being repeated by docs who have not kept up with the latest best practices for bleeding disorders. If you are the US Women and Girls with Bleeding Disorders might help \nAnd a Hemophilia Treatment Center\nYes bleeding disorders are best treated by a doc who specializes in them. Sorry this is happening no one should have to deal with a heavy period What country? Or if US, which State? Are you being seen at a Htc?  If not, local hem/onc docs are of no use.  Htc can get you a personalized treatment plan, you will most likely need factor due to heavy menses.  The sooner you get seen at a Htc, the sooner you can get your bleeding disorder under control Try being a nearly 50yo woman with a lifetime of unexplained bleeding and periods from hell. Even after my youngest was diagnosed 16 years ago with severe haemophilia, I was told women do not get haemophilia. Just symptomatic carrier. I gave up on medical science that day. To this day, women, especially as they age, are invisible and treated as redundant. It is really enraging how much we \"have to be our own advocates\" as women (in my experience of the US healthcare system). I am not the doctor, but I have to basically diagnose myself and throw a fit to get taken seriously. I often take my husband with me just to nod and confirm my symptoms to the doctor just to be taken seriously. It is disgusting.\n\nIt is really hard to find good doctors, for rare bleeding disorders or just regular health stuff. I hope you are having better luck fighting the system these days. Be well &lt;3 Humate P once or twice during your period would help a lot. I have people I work with with vwd and it is pretty standard to prescribe it. It is an iv infusion, but it is not too difficult to do, or you can go to an infusion center if you do not want to do it yourself.

Being a individual who stayed away from confrontation/fights/sports due to my condition has caused me social anxiety \n\nBut i dont want to kicked in the head/torso and bleed to death lmao Bjj if you know your limits and are smart is doable but you got to be ontop of your medicine and do intense streching before you dtart each time. Bring alchohol wipes and make sure your body is already well conditioned and toned. I wrestle. Severe A I had a friend who was severe who did something like that. Not sure of the exact discipline though. He got some bleeds from it, but he got into much better overall shape because of it, which made him less likely to get a random one. So it is a bit of a trade off there. My advice is to find an instructor who you can have a frank conversation about your limitations with and see if they have any input. As long as you treat aggressively and listen to your body and do not push it too much, it should be manageable. And as always talk to your HTC before you do it. They will not like it, but they can be convinced if you are determined and take the right precautions. They do not need to be on board with it, but they should at least be aware.

Warning for TMI regarding periods Hey! Just wondering if it is worth getting tested for VWD again, since my original test never got returned. I have been on my period since late July, and have historically had 10-15 day periods, often multiple times a month. They are usually moderately heavy (I go through an Ultra sized tampon in about 2 hours) but this one has been relatively light. I cannot think of any instances of mine of abnormally long bleeding, and I have never even had a nosebleed, despite having hayfever. My ears bleed on occasion, but that always coincides with an ear infection. I do sometimes have \"unexplained\" bruises, but I am super clumsy and often lightheaded due to POTS. I have had two pelvic/renal ultrasounds and a CT scan for reasons unrelated as this and all showed a normal reproductive tract. Besides a low RBC count and high hemoglobin/hematocrit and some other random stuff, my CBCs have been pretty normal, and I do not have a Factor V mutation. I am on birth control. Would it be possible for this to be caused by VWD, even though I do not have any other symptoms? Has anyone else had this experience and been diagnosed with VWD? I have no family history of clotting or menstrual disorder besides Factor V Leiden and endo. I had a similar experience regarding heavy, prolonged periods, lightheadedness, and bruising before getting diagnosed. I always had pretty heavy periods multiple times a month, and then at one point I had a period that lasted 215 days. At this point the only bleeding I ever experience was from my period and had no other indication that I had a bleeding disorder. I had no known family members that had a bleeding disorder, so I had no idea what was wrong with me. It took about a month and three doctors later to get diagnosed with Type 1 Von Willebrand Disease, because my blood test results kept coming back inconclusive. The easy bruising may be an iron deficiency. Im not entirely sure if what your experiencing is Von Willebrand Disease, but if I were you, I would talk to your doctor and have your factor VIII levels tested. It never hurts to talk to your doctor about an issue or concern you have. I hope this helps! I had similar symptoms and been diagnosed with Factor X deficiency. Might be worth getting rechecked for everything, at least your PT/APPT Okay! I have been talking to doctors, I just was not sure if this was something that needed to be checked. I had 14 vials drawn a few days ago, so I might call and ask if a VWD test can be added to that. Thank you so much for the info! I had not even heard of Factor X being related to this! Thank you so much!  By PT/APPT you are referring to partial thromboplastin time, yes? That is what I am assuming, but we use a different abb at the lab I work at so I wanted to double check haha Of course! I hope you get this figured out! I would get tested a couple of times, as your VW factor changes throughout your cycle. The best time for me to get tested is while I am bleeding, and I am VWB type 1. It took 3 tests (1 borderline, 1 negative, and then 1 positive) for me to get an official diagnosis. I have also never had a nose bleed, and only the heavy bleeding! I wish you the best of luck in figuring out what is going on Oh damn! Maybe I will have to go back in then.

The lab diagnosed him with Hemophilia A severe.  \n I want to ask you guys something he never had an inner bleed he is child he can speak a little bit so when he get hurt somewhere he tell us like legg arm or something like that, but was make me couris why he never had an joint bleed or something like that. Can the lab mistake the type of hemophilia? Can someone tell me please.  \n\n\nSorry for my english, I wish all of you here have an amazing day,week,month,year and LIFE! If your son is on a routine of prophylactic infusion every two days, the level of factor 8 in his body is likely high enough that his body functions more like that of a person without hemophilia. It is highly unlikely that the doctors would make a mistake diagnosing him. Sounds like he is well managed and has parents who take good care of him! Have you considered getting a second opinion from a different doctor? We live in Europe (ballkan) we are going to make another blood test in another country since our country is not well equpit. Thanks for reply Thank you Good luck. Yup what he said ^ if his factor blood levels stay above like 1% hes likely to not bleed. The every 2 day treating is keeping him from getting joint bleeds. I use to have it every single day when j had a mediport . What is your native language What country? Kosovo Albanian  Hey there. So if he is only 19 months old he is probably just learning to walk around then. Most bleeds will be from trauma. Even the \"spontaneous\" ones are usual just from low level trauma we are unaware of at the time (or a target joint). Most of the injuries your son is likely to have had so far are from bumping into something. As he gets older he will be running around more and jumping off things and being a kid. This will produce more stress on his joints than he is experienced till now. That is when you should expect more joint bleeds.

Anyone else using Stimate for menstrual period control? I have had long periods (menorrhagia) my entire life, birth control has never really helped with it. \n\nI recently had blood work done, and I have vWF deficiency/maybe possibly VWD Type 1. \n\nMy hematologist has prescribed me Stimate, which honestly was a huge hassle to get (had to order from a specialty pharmacy). \n\nI am kind of excited to start my period to see if it is shorter! I am going to be taking 2 sprays for the first 2 days of my period. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Also -- how big of a deal is the water retention? The Rx paperwork makes it sound like I am going to die if I drink more than a thimble of water, lol. Stimate barely works at all but there are some who like it. Usually moderate or mild type 1 von willebrands patients \n\nI much prefer using lysteda/tranexamic acid (or sometimes amicar) and Humate P (sometimes Wilate instead)\n\n\nI do not bother with using stimate. Pretty pointless for me Oh and the water retention is VERY SERIOUS\nWhen I used to take it, I would avoid all liquid as much as possible.   If you start slurring your speech, go to the  ER Thanks for your reply. My blood results were:\n\nFFactor VIII Activity: 68 (normal is 56-140)\n\nBNFvon Willebrand Factor (vWF): 47\u00a0(normal is 50-200)\n\nFvWF Activity: 30\u00a0(normal is 50-200)\n\nSo my hematologist said I was low but not quite VWD 1 level because my factor 8 was still in normal. Hopefully this means the Stimate may work a little better for me. \n\nI have been reading a lot about tranexamic acid &amp; even studies say that the Stimate works better in conjunction with the TA. \n\nI do not know if I like my hematologist that much. She seemed to brush me off and made weird comments about my other health problems. \n\nThanks for your reply. I will see how this period goes and bring up tranexamic acid at my next appointment. REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOT TAKE THIS LIGHTLY!!! \n\nToo much water after taking Stimate can be the last mistake you ever get to make. Thank you for the advice about the treatment centers. Will they still take me even though I do not have a real diagnosis other than low vWF? \n\nAnd this sucks, I drink a ton of water. Do you know how long after my doses I can start drinking normally again? The pharmacists did not even tell me not to drink water, if I had not read the pamphlet I would not have known. I wish they would have said how important it is if it can be actually deadly. :( Our HTC takes all consults and I imagine that we are not atypical.\n\nThe water intake should be limited for between 8 and 12 hours after.  The less you drink the better.  Try gatorade or other balanced salt solutions to slake your thirst, but do so in sips.\n\nThe drug is a chemical analog of the hormone, Vasopressin.  It is the hormone that stops you from making urine in the desert. The problem with water is that when the drug is in you, your kidneys think its Mohave time, and you hold onto water.  Because you are drinking water in regular amounts, the balance between the salt in your body and the water intake is distorted and your sodium levels can fall into the very low numbers rapidly, leaving you damaged, or dead (even just the damage is bad).\n\nWe tell the parents and the kids to not drink any water for 10-12 hours and to sip gatorade in small amounts to cut their thirst.\n\nOnce the drug is out of you (between 8 and 12 hours after taking it), then you can drink water in any amount you normally drink.  it is just the period of time when it is there, and after that, your kidneys are back to normal.\n\nI do not want you to panic.  STIMATE is a good drug and has a good safety profile.  We use it frequently.  But the water thing is a big problem. Thank you so very much. This information is so helpful. Tranexamic acid is great stuff. It is contraindicated if you use birth control with an estrogen since it can increase the risk of blood clots.\nAssuming you are in the US, tranexamic acid is generic and dirt cheap, which is a nice thing compared to Stimate. Seconding Tranexamic Acid. Stimate often gave me rebound headaches and I could not cope with the restrictions on fluid intake and how often it can be used. Typically for my period now, I will infuse von Willebrand Factor on day one and then continue with TA for the duration of my period. Every body is different but I would definitely ask about TA when you see your doctor. Ohhhhhh you are super mild then. Yeah I mean sure give stimate a try if you want. But I would start with Lysteda/tranexamic acid.  Can you call/email your doc? You could get them to call in the prescription to Walgreens or cvs or any Normal pharmacy. It is just a pill. Pretty inexpensive too and no side effects. It is super helpful too! \n\nAlso are you using a menstrual cup? I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend tracking blood volume loss using a menstrual cup. Most standard cups hold 30ml. Most hematologist will give you way more attention if you call and Say \u201cI have lost 200ml in 24hours\u201d vs saying \u201cit is really heavy lots of pads and tampons\u201d\nREAL data for them will get Attention fast FYI very severe patients can use it with estrogen birth control but this OP patient is not severe enough but just FYI for anyone reading this \nSource: I am type 3 severe and use them together per reco from my doc Yes yes yes!!!!

Do any of my fellow Von Willebrand sufferers get anemia rashes? I am allergic to dust, so naturally I have allergic reactions quite frequently. I sometimes get red spots under my skin that generally go away after a few hours. I am assuming that they are anemia rashes because they do not look like normal hives. Anyone else experience this? Any cause for concern? My best friend has VWD and I have never heard him say anything about it. Not all rashes from allergic reactions are hives though.  My son has food allergies and they can be just red and itchy without being raised. \n.\nBest bet would be just to make a phone call to your hematologist and see if they recommend coming in or not. Or discuss at your yearly appt if it is not serious Thank you! I have heard of anemia rashes presenting the same way. It is nothing of concern to me usually since they go away, but you never know! I similarly have reactions like this. I usually just take a benadryl and an iron supplement and take a nap and they go away shortly there after. if a benadryl does not help i would maybe reach out to your hematologist and check in with them. Nope, 2A and have never had anemia rashes.  My daughter (who also has VWD ) has had some cases of hives they had trouble pinpointing the source of but they were close enough to have been on antibiotics that they decided to mark her allergic to penicillin as a precaution (both outbreaks were a couple of days after finishing the course of medicine) I have VWB and I get these all the time.

I did a demo for the SoCal walk a few years ago :) I am happy to talk more if you are interested. I have Hemophikia A Mild, and it might not be inspirational, but I do make knives as a hobby. It is easy to get singled out when you are young and have a rare blood disease, but it does not really stop you from achieving greatness if you work hard. That is a really cool hobby! I always wanted to learn how to blacksmith There are a lot of good YouTube tutorials on how to do it. My favorite way to make a knife is actually called \" stock removal\" which is not the same to blacksmithing at all, but I do both. Essentially, instead of hammering out a rough shape with hot metal, you get a flat piece of bar stock in whatever metal you need, trace out your knife, use an angle grinder, jigsaw, or bandsaw ( the sawblade absolutely **must** be specifically made for cutting metal in opinion) and then you sand everything, and you file on some bevels. \n\nHandles are really cool. Basically if you make a full tang knife, you are just sandwiching a chunk of metal between two pieces of wood or whathave you. It is very worthwhile once you have gotten a hang of it. But it is unfortunately dangerous if you are not paying attention to safety. \n\nIf you want to get into blacksmithing, a small bit of advice:\n\nWhat you sacrifice in time spent, you save in cost. So you can go get a bunch of hand tools, and your little torch, and save a lot a lot of money, and it will take a very long time to make a good knife. I enjoy this a lot. \n\nOr you can spend thousands and thousands of dollars to make hundreds in a day, but I do not really enjoy this as much because it does not feel like I am ** creating** something Awesome, thanks for this info man! Stock removal sounds like something I could potentially do", "Hemophiliacs and anecdotal experiences Hi there,\n\nI am curious if there are any hemophiliacs on here who are interested in nutrition, and/or have also found that changing the nutrition they consume helps manage Hemophilia symptoms (for example, reducing bleeds per year)?\n\nThis has been a huge part of my experience, but as I see, there are not many research studies done on the connection between hemophilia and nutrition, so I am curious about the community\u2019s anecdotal experiences.\n\nIf you do not believe in nutrition, that is okay too! I just ask that we leave this thread for people who do believe that nutrition is a real topic we can discuss within the community. \n\nThanks!

Good to see you again ( Sorry you did not want to finish this discussion in the ( Here is the deal: you have a genetic disorder that requires replacement of a specific blood factor to combat the effects. There is not a nutritional diet that you can eat to improve your condition. Sorry. It sucks. The reason why you cannot find any studies on this is because there are not homeopathic remedies to rare genetic blood conditions. Sorry again. It sucks.\n\nWhat is not helpful is posting garbage advice about taking vitamin C supplements, or drinking stinging nettle tea, or whatever other herbalist nonsense you have come up with. People here have real problems, and there are real, scientific solutions that can be shared. If you do not want to contribute in a way that is helpful to the community, then I suggest you do not contribute. I will start, and say that, when I began to eat more anti-inflammatory foods, I definitely noticed a huge reduction in the amount of internal bleeds I have per year! I am a severe hemophiliac with a right knee target joint! I think that eating healthier foods definitely also made me stop getting nosebleeds. I used to have nosebleeds a lot! When I changed to eating differently, more fruits and veggies and such, I do not really get nosebleeds anymore. The last time has to be years ago! OP has chronically been feeding this sub with outright wrong information and denial of having Hemophilia. ( Generally, I am open for more discussion on possible secondary treatments or helpful lifestyle modifications, but their history does not make me want to allow for that. Their claims have no basis, no evidence-based results, and is entirely based off of their small window. Further, their age fluctuates from 18 years old to early 20s.  Wow! People really keep track on here, huh. So my discussion on my unknown injury that I believed was related to HemLibra, makes this discussion on nutrition closed off, then. I am in my early 20s.\n\nAlso, I do agree that my experience is a small window, which is why I asked if anyone else wanted to share experiences.\n\nI do not understand why sharing an unknown effect that I believed was related to this medication is perceived as misinformation.\n\nThis sub, I thought would be a safe place for sharing this info, but I was pretty much shut down and canceled after I shared it, which is why I deleted that post. Anecdotally, as I grew into my 20s, my bleeding has gotten a lot fewer than when I was in my 10s. So it might not be your herbal remedies and vitamin C, just growing up in general. Okay! Thank you for sharing that. I do not necessarily think it is all based on my supplements or herbs, but I do believe that the things I eat such as eating more healthy vegetables and fruits have helped a lot.\n\nI do appreciate the anecdotal info When did I deny having hemophilia? I am a severe hemophiliac. I have not said otherwise I mean this as a positive conversation, yet people are kind of shutting me down and canceling my anecdotal experience.\n\nIt is okay to disagree on the topic, but I do not get why people have to make it personal and continue to shut me down as a person. \n\nThis is why I do not really post in this sub If I have to guess, it is because your anecdotal experience does not have much correlation with each other. For example, \"Hey after I started dating, my bleeding has gotten a lot better. Does anyone have ANECDOTAL experience of having less frequent bleeds after being in a relationship (or after being sexually active?)\". Full disclaimer: I do not believe dating or sexually activity has any effect on hemophilia and/or bleeding. An anecdotal experience is just that, not based in fact, but based in experience Citing 'anecdote' does not shield you from getting challenged/questioned/corrected/educated by others. \n\nIf I claim: **HEY I AM JUST SAYING, IN MY EXPERIENCE, MY BLEEDING WAS IMPROVED AFTER I STARED DATING.**\n\n\nJust cuz I said 'in my experience' does not mean others cannot tell me I am making wrong conclusion/interpretation about what happened to my life.  k, I will bite. What makes you think nutrition and herbal remedies has impact on your genetic disorder? (Other than saying \"Anecdotally, it helped for ME\")  Uh.. You have literally just posted an \"Anecdotally, it helped for ME\" response when I specifically asked \"Other than\". \n\n&gt; Because when I started eating anti inflammatory foods, my number of bleeds per year reduced and I do not get nosebleeds anymore. I also just have more energy, feel better overall, and feel it is a positive effect on my health because I get sick less\n\nIs it possible that cuz you got older, you just bleed less? Also, eating healthy has positive benefit to your OVERALL health. (That should be obvious to everybody) Are you trying to say \"I am better fit and healthier overall since I am eating better. Being better fit and healthier overall seems to have positive effect for me, who happens to be hemophiliac\"? I dont want to discuss with you anymore because it just seems like this convo is going in circles. &gt;I do not know any experiences besides my own, which is why I was asking the community. One persons experience is not strong enough evidence for sure\n\nYes, but ignoring people's counter claim to your baseless interpretation of your experience is not leading to a positive/informational conversation.\n\nAnd as others have pointed out, without any good logical reasoning behind your claim, you are just posting potentially incorrect, misleading, or just useless information to people who have a serious condition.", "Catalyst Biosciences and ISU Abxis Complete Dosing of First Patient Cohort in Hemophilia B Clinical Trial ", "'A step closer' to gene therapy for hemophilia  ", "Goodbye Kaiser, and good riddance This is a rant and a celebration:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to the ED for a torn calf muscle and associated bleed.

You just have to understand that when looking for work, a career path that does not beat you up is a necessity as well as a field that offers quality health insurance. You are probably going to have to sacrifice a higher paying job for better health insurance. That is what happened to me. And unlike the 1% comment , I am no wheres NEAR the \"1%\". But I have affordable insurance rates sitting at a desk 37h a week. I think when someone is comfortable in the place they live in, they cannot imagine living anywhere else - me included. I have luckily never needed any surgeries as all my joints are perfectly healthy even though I have severe hem A. It is actually the norm for my generation of severe bleeders to have no joint issues unless you have or have had some complications like antibodies. What I do know is that my care for hemophilia has also been top notch, even though my parents came as war refugees from the Balkans to Sweden with no jobs initally and of course no insurance, and yet their little baby (me) was able to get treatment and live the rest of his life without complications. I imagine the situation would have been entierly different for me in the USA. I always joke with my wife that I am going to hire some Swedish bikini models for our son's birthday party. haha  \n\n\nI get what you are saying though about no being able to imagine living anywhere else.

Have you considered switching to an extended half-life product? I had a side affect of sore joints and tendons, while taking it every two weeks. So we halved the dose and I take it every week now and it works fine. I do think it was an immune response , since it felt similar to the soreness from the the flu. But I am not sure why it happened. Luckily it went away. It has changed my life for sure. Nothing works 100% of the time. I hope it works long term. We will see. But for now it is been a life saver. Sorry to hear, each person reacts differently with Hemlibra.  I would also add, the recent death count reported by Genentech is truly staggering.  There will be other Sub Q products coming to market in the future and hopefully you are body will tolerate it better.  \n\nJust curios, but when you were having break thru bleeds on hemlibra, were you treating with factor or waiting it out to see if it would resolve on its own? \n\nThis is the most updated count on Hemlibra patient deaths.  Genentech does not comment on any of this That is information one can get from their htc.  No comment because there has not to our knowledge been a death directly related to the drug I was treating it with factor straight away Some of the htcs I have talked to have no idea either, and at a recent patient event, the Genentech rep would not comment bc their medical liaison was not by their side.  \n\nAs a new player in this market, they should be much more transparent. Where is Hemlibra classified as experimental? Thanks for sharing, sorry to hear about your issues, both in general and with Hemlibra.  I am still planning on switching this year, I am sick of sticking myself with a butterfly and need something that will greatly improve my life for once, so far this looks like it. Here is hoping anyway.  I hope things work out better for you in the future, there are still new products coming. Just needs to work long enough to get us to more permanent options. Hopefully those come to be (safely) but Hemlibra was enough of a risky switch for me as is. I do not really trust the gene therapy options right now, since they are basically undoable and they seem to have a lot of rise and drop in factor percentages. Eloctate is really nice. I can agree with that", "Spark Therapeutics And Pfizer Announce Receipt Of FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation For SPK-9001 For The Treatment Of Hemophilia B ", "How close are we to curing Hemophilia using CRISPR? Do not believe the current gene-therapy trials follow the same approach as CRISPR? If so, are there any ongoing trials or advancements in developing a treatment for Hemophilia using the same? Also, if developed, would the treatment again cost about  a million dollars? I am far from an expert, but crispr seems very promising. Unfortunately it will likely take many years to be approved by the FDA and be brought to market. I remember when I was little and I would ask my parents \u201cwhen will there be a cure?\u201d they would always respond with 5 years. That was 30 years ago, and gene therapy is just now finally a real thing lol. ( Do not hold your breath", "Trends in Conventional and New Pharmaceuticals Use for Hemophilia Among Medicaid Enrollees  Thanks for posting these articles and journals! \n\nThe sharp drop in the use of factor with the introduction of commercially available Hemlibra is quite staggering. A nearly 70% drop in dosage use in the span of a few years is really significant. Anecdotally, from talking with fellow hemos in my area, the expectation was there was going to be a slower uptake and change to Hemlibra cause factor has been so reliable for so long. \n\nI would be interested to see if they would be able to expand this study outside of only Medicaid, and include some large private insurers like UHC or Aetna. Then we could get a full understanding of how quickly people have switced over. Great read!", "Sigilon Therapeutics Announces Clinical Hold on SIG-001 Phase 1/2 Study in Hemophilia A  FYI, SIG-001 is the laparoscopically inserted FVIII-producing \"beads.\"", "30, severe A. Have some questions for others near my age and older, but all are welcome to chime in. HemLibra users too please. Hey all, a bit about me... so I am nearing 31, I have Severe A diagnosed at around 8mos old. Runs in the family.  I had a high inhibitor as a kid, a broken jaw leading to severe blood loss at age 7 allowed me to be immune tolerized after blood transfusions... since then I have lived a mostly reclusive sedentary lifestyle intentionally, primarily because I did not want to have to be on prophylaxis after i got my port removed, and I figured out a lifestyle that mostly works okay with me treating on demand and I was fairly comfortable with it.\n\nI have some damage in my ankles, primarily the right one, which is partially due to me being stupid, and partially due to a short lived job path that had me on my feet a lot, not wanting to miss work I would show up with an active bleed and work through the pain(the stupidity part). It is not bad enough to have fused at this point, and for the most part I get around just fine and have bleeding under control, which again is mostly from the reclusive sedentary lifestyle I have chosen. \n\nAnyway, I have noticed over the years that other hemophiliacs as well as myself seem to have a higher pain tolerance than most people, and I wonder if you too have seen this as the case in your lives?  \n\nRelated to that, it seems like as I get older my pain tolerance goes down, either that or the bleeding episodes I have been having in the last year or so are more severe than usual. Do you feel like your pain tolerance has lessened as you have aged?  Example, I have a shoulder bleed right now that I have no explanation for, and the first things I did when I woke up with it were take a 100% dose of F8, and take ibuprofen.  I almost never go for pain killers of any kind, but I needed them today, and it still hurts enough that I constantly know it is there. \n\nOnto HemLibra, those of you who are on it, could you please chime in with how long you have been on it, and how it is been for you? I am still using Recombinate and as I get older the desire for something better gets stronger and stronger, but I am always reluctant to switch to product in its early stages because of poor past experiences I have witnessed with other Hemos I know.  I have grown tired of this mostly sedentary and reclusive lifestyle, and I want to feel like I can get out and do more things without putting my ankles(and everything else) at further risk for more damage, but I despise prophylaxis. I self infuse, I just do not particularly like sticking myself that regularly if I can help it. \n\nIs HemLibra the answer?  Should I seriously pursue it and waive my own personal policy of no new products/treatment options less than 5 years old? Or is there something better that I am unaware of?  I do not particularly mind the reclusive lifestyle all the time, but there are more moments now in my life that I feel held back by on demand recombinant treatment than I used to, and I am quickly growing tired of it.\n\nAlso, what is your dosing schedule on HemLibra?  My HTC said it is a once a week minimum if I want to switch, but I have heard some data over in Europe/UK indicating once a month is perfectly adequate, but they refuse to accept that as an option for some reason. My son (16 years old) switched to Hemlibra last summer. We used to average roughly a bleed every 3 weeks. Since Hemlibra, we have not had a single bleed in 7 months. When it is time for him to take his shot, I tell him its time to take his miracle cure. For us, it has been that good.\n\n\nBased on our experience...\n\nThe pros:\n\n* one easy injection into a fatty area (belly, thigh, etc) every 14 days\n\n* No side effects we have noticed.\n\n* keeps a constant factor level so we no longer need to preemptively give factor before things like dental visits or events that might see him get hurt (birthday parties, sporting events, etc).\n\n*  No more random bleeds or unexplained bruises. No more calls from the school nurse, and we no longer have to worry whether some unexplained pain is a bleed and should be treated. For all day-to-day purposes, he no longer has Hemophilia.\n\n* At present, Hemlibra has copay assistance that has no means test (you can get it regardless of your income), so it is currently much cheaper ($10/month) than recombinate was ($200/3-4 weeks) \n\n\nDownsides:\n* my son says the injection is very painful. He is really slim and it might be due to not having larger fatty areas to inject.\n\n* While it is very cheap right now, once the assistance ends hemlibra might be $400 a month (this is due to our insurance currently charging us 2 copay for each monthly shipment. I am told most other insurance plans only charge one)\n\n* the nagging worry that the drug is new, and might have unforeseen side effects in the future.\n\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend it. Note that the copay assistance was something we had to get going ourselves, so if you take the plunge make sure to look into it yourself as your healthcare providers might not know about it.\n\nHope this helps :) 34 yrs old, severe A here. I feel you on hating the prophylaxis. I got really bad anxiety for a few years in my 20s due to the feel of the needle piercing the scar tissue on my veins. I thankfully got over it and kept on a, as my HTC social worker calls, prophy lite schedule.  This was while I was using eloctate, supposed to be every 3 days but I was doing probably once every week to two weeks depending on bleeds/pain. I have my left ankle fused and my right ankle is giving me a lot of problems. Also have an issue with my right elbow that has limited movement and caused an increase in pain over the years.\n\nAll that being said, I dont think my pain tolerance has gone down at all. I think the severity of my bleeds and the recurrence of some of them are simply just more painful sometimes. My doctor prescribed Celebrex for my right ankle and elbow and that seems to have done a pretty good job at keeping my inflammation down which keeps my pain low. I feel like I do much better when I am active consistently, I get less bleeds and am overall healthier. \n\nLastly, on the HemLibra front, I have to say I am loving it. Just from an infusion stand point, having to infuse subcutaneous versus intravenous is a game changer. I have no problems keeping up with prophy and at this point in my life I need to be taking better care of myself as my body is not exactly getting younger. I have been on it since October of last year and outside of the loading dose period I infuse once every two weeks. No bleeds since starting and I started doing a lot of weight lifting after. \n\nOverall, it is up to you on breaking your policy or not, I personally dont want to wait 5 years for something that can prevent me from having another joint go to shit which will be a lifetime of problems for me. Good luck to you! If you have any questions feel free to ask or DM me. I am just a few years older than you and never like prophylaxis either. I an A severe as well I used on demand for as long as I can remember. I have been in IT the past decade and have done a whole lot of wire pulling and thing I should not be doing, but I did not struggle with bleeds that much. I averaged may 1 or two a month at the most. My targets are my elbows and ankles. I have pretty bad damage in all of them. My elbows have been locked at about 45 degree angles since I was 16. My ankles have pretty bad arthritis as well.\nI started Hemlibra about 4 months ago and it is truly life changing. I immediately felt a difference in my ankles as soon as the first injection finished. I had a limp going into the doctors office and walked out without one. I was even able to walk up and down stairs normally without sidestepping my way down as I often. have to due to pain in my ankles. I have not had a single bleed since I started and feel better than ever. The cold weather does make my ankles act up pretty good, but I did a 28 mile nature hike last November and no bleeds. It is truly life changing. If you are on the fence and it is an option for you, I would take it. It has been a miracle drug for me as well. I can hold my kids and play with them with no issues. My pain level has went down to next to nothing.  Even the arthritis pain is way better than it was. It is tolerable now. Before there was no walking at the end of a long day, now it is just uncomfortable at worst. Thank you so much for this reply. I sincerely appreciate your time to give me this information.  As for older pre-existing joint issues, the few people I personally know and have talked to that switched said their constant low level joint aches and pains have pretty much gone away and it has basically been life changing for them.  I have heard the F8 levels are within the 10-16% range at all times, so 15% seems within what I have been hearing as well.  This is the first time in my entire life that a product has come out that I have been seriously interested in switching to, and being that I am basically a lifelong Recombinate user by personal choice, and super picky and cautious about new pharma stuff, that is really saying something. Pm me. Let us talk in person. I can help with all of this but it would take talking to do justice answering these questions. I have had all of the same problems that you have had and that you speak of. I am using hemlibra, have had ankle surgery, I am a bit older and reluctant to use new products for good reason, but I also work in hemophilia and have an understanding of the available treatments. If you would like to talk let me know. Thanks for taking the time to reply. Perhaps my hypothesis of my pain tolerance lowering over time is just my brain trying to not let myself admit that I have as severe of a bleed when I do in fact have such.  I totally feel you on the taking better care of yourself thing. I am finally realizing that I need to do something now if I want to have any kind of decent quality of life 30+ years from now.  I wish I could go back in time and tell younger me not to be such an idiot about treatments and self care.  Interesting that you seem to have less bleeding episodes by staying more active, to an extent I have experienced similar myself.  My hobbies and interests typically involve activities where I am at risk of busting knuckles etc(car enthusiast) and I have managed an on demand treatment regimen with a side of \u201cprophy-life\u201d where I treat before I work on my car or something.  Not having to think about that and being able to just go work on my car or go on a hike or any of the other things I have always wanted to do but have been cautious of is certainly enticing.  I am leaning more and more toward trying HemLibra every day. I think this might be the year for it. Thanks for taking the time to share this. The more people I talk to about it the more it seems like I am going to be making the switch.  Almost everyone if not everyone I have talked to about it says the same thing, \u201clife changing\u201d some of the stories, yours included, are hard for me to even fathom. Sounds fine to me. I am all about more knowledge, especially on this and from someone who is even half as reluctant to switch as I am would be helpful. No problem! I remember a time when I was a kid and my mom bought my sister and I a trampoline to play on. During that summer I spent every day on it and it helped me lose weight and have less bleeds by being active. Of course, each person is different and you should always try to do low impact activities - but we figured out early that doing something was better than doing nothing. \n\nGetting older sucks, and it was weird when I was in my twenties that I spent a lot of time limping around like a sixty year old due to my ankle. Even my wife's grandmother had her ankle fused at the same time as me. I think that gave me a wakeup call that unfortunately our bodies get demolished by this disease, not nearly as bad as my grandfather, but enough that I should be actively trying to mitigate any further damage if I can. I am forever thankful that at least medicine these days is not giving me another HepC infection. With Hemlibra my HTC was pretty thorough on explaining the complications that had been reported and made me infuse on site to ensure nothing weird happened. Almost 4 months later and I have not looked back. Awesome. I was told by the PT at my HTC that I should really make an effort to drop weight to help my ankles. It is easier said than done with a near entirely sedentary lifestyle that I have adopted many years ago. I am in the same boat, I am not crazy overweight but it all adds up. If I can contain it to just my ankles that would be great, would really suck to have my knees or hips start to give me problems.\n\nWith any lifestyle change it takes you to have a new outlook, otherwise it wont stick. Sounds like you are starting to see the benefit of the change, now it is the hard part of doing the work and sticking to it long enough to make it something you no longer even have to think about. I have not made the jump to Hemlibra but I am severe A mid 40s with plenty of damage.  Did not get on the prophylaxis wagon until late 30s.  As far as pain, I have noticed \"new\" pain is the worst.  I guess we find ways to tolerate chronic pain in the same place.  Probably something built into humans and animals to survive but when something different than usual pops up, it can be rough.  I have also had issues where certain joints give me another level of pain.  Most bleeds were low, throbbing, constant, dull pain but for a while, an ankle or elbow bleed would have me considering some dark options.  My ankles finally got worn out enough that they are tolerable and overall prophylactic treatment has kept me from dealing with \"new\" pain.  Sounds like Hemlibra might be a good option for you.  Also, I took ibuprofen by the handful for many years.  It is unmatched for OTC pain medication but it also encourages bleeding so I was only making things worse in the long run.  Talk to your doc about Celebrex or Meloxicam for an anti-inflammatory that will not encourage bleeding.  From what I remember talking to a Hemlibra rep, once a month works decent but depending on the dose, you may be forced to spread it out over the month, hence once or twice per week.  But I am not an expert and it is been a while since I asked about the \"once a month\" reality of Hemlibra.   Just some info based on my personal experience.  Hopefully it helps you work out a comfortable program for yourself. We had much the same feeling. There has been lots of talk of new meds over the years, but they would seem to fail in trials or disappear entirely from the news. We stopped paying attention years ago and thought Recombinate would be it for the forseeable future.\n\nSo when Hemlibra started causing a buzz we were kind of \"meh\" about it at first. We really only started paying attention when my son started showing signs that he might be getting trigger joints in his knee and ankle. \n\nI am still kind of in awe of how life changing this stuff turned out. Here is hoping hemlibra is as good to you as it has been to us. Hi bud. I am a little older and have some similar situations with my ankle and background.\n\nSo I am 34, both my ankles are fuuuuucked but I have not had them fused yet. I still have a little range of motion. I also worked jobs where I was on my feet for like 13 years and I also worked through the injuries. Dumb, but hey we all live and learn. I wish someone had been there to intervene for me but life just does not seem to work that way. Not the advice you asked for but do not beat yourself up too bad for it.\n\nI am &lt;1% severe A. I have been doing prophy with no port for like 20 years. Although only just middling prophy adherence.\n\nI switched to hemlibra 2 months ago and have not had a bleed since. I even caught a bone spur in my ankle the other day and even though I was sore a couple days, I made it through just fine. I have only had one dose of advate since I started hemlibra and it was out of an over abundance of caution. \n\nI do three injections once a week. Honestly it is so much easier than factor, I love it. For me the injections have absolutely no pain most of the time, and if they do, it is very minor.\n\nIf everyone had my experience, hemlibra would be the new standard treatment for everyone.\n\nI do keep advate on hand in case I have an accident, but my quality of life has improved so much!!!\n\nJust some personal advice too \u2014 you do not have to be a recluse. Not with the right friends and job. I would highly recommend a job where you are seated. IT, phone service, etc. \n\nOnce I got a job where I did not have to be in my feet, my life took off. I finished my BA which helped me get a job answering phones. Now I have worked my ass off since I appreciate the place so much, and I am finishing my MBA and getting married, only 2.5 years after I got the original desk job.\n\nMy point is, happiness and fulfillment is within reach for all of us. Yeah. Making the change will definitely take some time to get used to, but I am confident I can make that change if I really focused on it.  I am not crazy overweight either, but it does add up as you said. My right ankle apparently has been abnormal for longer than I even was aware, and my body has adjusted to walking with the joint missing some range, as well as subconsciously favoring my other leg and not distributing weight evenly. My left leg is significantly more muscular than my right because of it. The PT told me if I keep that up it will eventually stress my hips and knees unevenly and lead to more issues. I already feel some occasional tenderness/super low level pain in my left knee, so I am actively seeking to mitigate that if I can, and dropping weight and switching to HemLibra seem to be the two tickets to maybe not being miserable and feeling like my body is 30 years older than it really is. You know, a weird suggestion but it helped me, is tai chi. My HTC had some tai chi expert come in and explain something is and work with us on some basic movements. Most of it I dont remember but one thing that stuck with me that I focus on constantly is being aware of how I move. How I walk down the street, how I walk down stairs, etc. Since I had pain in my ankle I would walk funny on my foot thinking it was helping when it was actually just hurting other parts of my foot and probably my whole movement chain up my leg. When I feel it hurt, I try to make better choices of how I walk. Keep my foot straight, do not stomp, just be aware of how I am moving. That little bit has really helped a lot. Thanks for the reply!  I very seldom take ibuprofen and only when I also take a dose of factor at the same time. I have discussed it with my hematologist and was told it is \u201cokay\u201d on occasion as long as it is when I have factor in me as well.  Tylenol does not seem to do much for me at all, and as you described, the chronic pain in wearing/damaged joints has sort of faded into background at this point, I am inclined to agree with your theory of adaptation for survival.  Perhaps the reason this shoulder bleed hurts so much is because I almost never if ever have one here.  Thanks for that perspective.   May I ask if you are considering making the jump to HemLibra as well?   I have been told by the HTC that I am an \u201cideal candidate\u201d but that just made me feel more like a science experiment to them. Hearing all the positive things from everyone who has switched is certainly encouraging. I still have some reservations, but they are slowly fading for the first time in as long as I can recall. Thanks so much for the reply. Congrats on getting married and your career path taking off. I am presently experiencing kind of the opposite swing. I was having ankle bleeds so frequently that I could not maintain a job, even sedentary. I ended up in a situation where I had to apply for disability benefits and honestly as much as it sucks, it is also been a blessing, because for the most part my expenses are covered, and I have been allowed time to stay off my ankle and let it heal.  It is been a long road, but I am at a point where the damaged one rarely experiences a bleed with my current lifestyle, which is pretty boring overall, but by choice.  I went from 1-2 times per week having a severe ankle bleed to so few that I would have to look at my logs to tell you the last one.  Staying on disability benefits is not remotely a long term option or my plan, I was reluctant to even apply for them because I did not feel like I really qualified, but looking back now, I would not trade the healing time I have managed to have for anything.  Part of my serious consideration for HemLibra is because I know I cannot survive forever like this and need to find a career path that is not detrimental to my body, but also have a personal life that is not depressing and does not result in missed days of work because of a spontaneous bleed.  Never thought I would be in this situation, but I am slowly looking to improve it and change my life for the better and that starts with acquiring data about this supposed miracle drug from others who I can relate to and can relate to me. I would like to help if I can, even if I am limited to just advising.\n\nWhat do you want to do? What is your work background and education? Feel free to pm me since you probably do not want that in a reddit comment. I have become substantially more self aware of my movements and walking as well. Maybe not to your level but I cannot say for sure. I am also far more aware of which leg I am giving more weight to and as long as I am not in pain or having a bleed I try to maintain a balance across both now and I think that has helped.  I also bought really nice(expensive $150) running shoes with the highest level of cushion and shock absorption I could get from Brooks(PT recommended that) and I got some really nice quality insoles that correct for my low arches and other foot weirdness, and that has been a substantial help. I put an old cheap pair of shoes on with \u201cshock absorbing\u201d inserts in them the other day to do something that would result in my shoes getting dirty, and within minutes my feet were killing me and I could not take it.  I wish someone told me years ago how important quality footwear and good quality insoles were. I will never own a cheap pair of shoes or inserts again, the $200ish that it is cost me for that combo is nothing compared to the discomfort and pain experienced with cheaper options.  It is odd owning a shoe made for runners, but they are the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and I will happily buy them again. The difference in pressure that I felt in all my joints in my legs the moment I put them on was mind boggling. Yeah I am thinking about switching to Hemlibra.  I am actually still on Recombinant which is pretty odd around here.  My HTC said they only have one other patient that is still on Recombinant.  Most switched to Eloctate or Advate or one of the other longer lasting products.  I have been doing really well on my Recombinant prophylaxis program and I am not anxious to change something that has worked so well.  I was late to the prophy game so when I started avoiding bleeds almost completely, I did not want to mess with success.  Switching products would take me from 12 sticks per month to 8 sticks per month but that did not seem like a big enough incentive for me to experimenting with another product.   Now with Hemlibra, it seems like it might be worth the change.  My HTC offered it to me last June but I wanted to wait a year to see what popped up.  So far everything I have heard has been positive so I will probably switch to Hemlibra this June when I go for my annual HTC visit.  Hemlibra was created for those with inhibitors which is probably why they have you labelled an \"ideal candidate\".  I understand not wanting to get pushed into a new product but it seems like this one might be worth the change.  That and the fact that I am finally starting to have a little trouble with my veins.  I would not mind an easy subcutaneous shot these days.  I am still looking for an example or two of guys that did not stay on Hemlibra though, just to satisfy my curiosity.  I am convinced it is a great product but I am not convinced any product is 100%.  I would like to hear about the problems or reasons people switched back to a traditional IV Factor VIII just to balance the reviews a little bit. I will add my 2 cents as well then. Turned 31 this past year, was on regular recombinant (Nuwiq to be exact) for about 3-4 years, still the bleeds were too frequent and I was not really \"feeling\" it. Now I started the new year on Elocta and I feel it working pretty much instantly on infusing. There is so many products to choose from nowadays, you just need to find something that works for you. My doc chose Elocta for me because it is been on the market the longest when it comes to extended half-life. At least in my country. \n\nI am also trying to mix things up with pain management. Experimenting with CBD and cannabis - oils are a bit too pricey for me and as a former smoker I appreciate the puffing. \n\nWe will get there! You will get there! You sound a lot like me in the way you think and handle product change.  I never bothered switching from Recombinate to any of the \u201clong acting\u201d products as I was already doing an on demand schedule and treat preventatively when I know I need to. And it worked for me and I did not want to screw anything up. My body is used to Recombinate, it seems to accept it just fine, and has for a long time, why mess with chance for a minimal change?  But yeah HemLibra seems almost too good to be true, never has a product gained my interest as much as this one has.  My annual HTC visit is coming up real soon so that is why I am digging in and doing my homework now, because there is a high chance I will be switching, which feels weird to even think about.  So far the only negatives my HTC told me about when I grilled them were that there have been a few known deaths due to an unforeseen circumstance with Feiba, and that some patients had experienced rejection of HemLibra after varying periods and had to go back to their old product and way of life. They did not have any data to be able to determine who might be at a higher risk of rejection based on genotyping or anything like that last I knew. But it is been nearly a year since I discussed it with them.  The product is a few years old now at this point and I am not hearing any major negative things if any negative things at all coming from any of the hemophilia community I am still somewhat connected with. I avoided Advate as my direct relatives with hemophilia(and theoretically the same or really similar gene mutation as mine) rejected it and had to go back to Recombinate.  But so far it is looking like HemLibra got it right and might just be the ticket to a better life for us. Thanks for the reply!  I have not had a good enough reason to switch to a longer acting product and have been on Recombinate for as long as I can remember and it works okay for me. I almost switched to Kogenate as it is manufactured very similarly to Recombinate and my direct relative with hemophilia had better results on it. But time kept moving and the switch never happened.  I am glad you found something that works for you, it is interesting trying to describe to someone who has not experienced it that you can actually feel whether the product is working almost immediately.  I appreciate you taking the time to respond.  Just curious, Is HemLibra available to you? And have you looked into it or considered it at all? It was in a \"beta\" phase for the longest time, one of our locals got to participate in the trials across the pond, but now it is available for all, I assume. I mentioned it to my doc a few times, but we somehow ended up on Elocta instead. I do not mind infusing in the classical sense. Past 30 here. Tried that sedentary thing with on demand treatment and it did not turn out well. The HTC observed that I actually bled less when working in jobs that were not sedentary. The logic was that it built up my muscles. Whatever works for you works, I am just completely over recombinant and intravenous stuff at this point and hoping that HemLibra is the game changer I have been waiting for. So far it looks like I will be switching in the near future. Yeah, I actually had kidney bleeds at one sedentary job, I attributed it to long hours sitting in a not very comfortable chair putting pressure on my kidneys. At one more physical job I had extremely frequent ankle bleeds that damaged the joint, as well as some other bleeds in various places. However I will note that after the very first initial muscle soreness all over phase I did seem to build up muscle and feel less generally sore most of the time, so there is some merit to that I guess. I do not want to get my hopes up too high for HemLibra, but I am hoping that this is the product that allows me to be able to get in better shape and maintain some muscle as well as not have bleeds in my ankles so I can maybe pursue some career paths that I have avoided because of that reason.  I am taking things one day at a time and have no intentions of rushing into anything though. What were the careers you wanted to do? I definitely feel like my pain tolerance has gotten higher. I actually read an article not to long ago about how people living in pain start to process it differently. The major side effect being I think I am grumpier because of my pain even if it does feel like my tolerance is higher. I am right up there age wise 31 and was diagnosed quite early as a severe type A. \n\nI have been on prophy for what seems like forever. Would love to try the Hemlibra but between insurance and the doctors I have not been able. However I am on Eloctate which does have my infusions down to once every four days. Which is nice.\n\nUnfortunately I too have the combination of stupidity and trying to do push myself harder than I should have when I was younger. The whole I do not want to be viewed as weak or different mindset probably does not help. So both of my ankles have issues left one is the worst. But I am actually having surgery on that one next week. Having an ankle replacement vs a fusion though because I do not want to risk damage to other joints caused by the lack of motion in a fusion. I cannot speak to the hemlibra but the Eloctate is well worth the switch I was on the recombinant way back in the day then the advate. But the Eloctate was a big game changer and I have been on it since. Saves me a stick a week but also there is less trough between dosing. I found that on traditional factor 8 I would have breakthrough bleeds on Sunday the longest period between doses. I am a tad bit older than you. Severe A. On Hemlibra for about a year now. Since the switch to Hemlibra, I have had zero bleeds. None. I operate chainsaws, hunt, ride four wheelers, shoot guns, and operate angle grinders with no guards. \n\nAs for the pain, it would take quite a bit to get me to have to sit down. Having a bone sticking out of the skin would probably make me want to take a breather. Anything short of that, I can just walk it off. Years ago I had an interest in owning my own automotive shop. Preferably more performance focused. Also very much like precision machining and making things. Things have changed a bit over the years and honestly I am not really sure what direction I will go moving forward, but I am hoping HemLibra is the key to a better life for me overall. I wish you the best with your replacement. Hope all goes well for you!  I am not quite at a place of needing either yet, and trying to keep it that way. If it came down to it I would go replacement as well. Nice to hear HemLibra works well for you too. I do not condone operating angle grinders without guards though... I am no clipboard warrior, but I have seen enough carnage even with proper PPE that I would much rather have the guard than not. I have begun the longer than I would like process of switching. Have to schedule appointments and wait mostly. Everyone I have talked to says the same thing.

Being the only.girl at the camp we treated her like a unicorn, just starting and following her around.  Then mid-week we found out about an all-girl's camp for the deaf next door and suddenly she was not so special anymore.  I have only ever met any other male hemophiliacs in passing at my annual doctor's visit so being a female with the condition must feel pretty lonely.  Hahahahaha! That poor girl was so close to first base, and she did not even realise! I am a female with VwD and a Factor VIII deficiency. Nice to meet you. Yea, with my excessive food allergies and bleeding disorder it makes dating REAL fun. It can be. I am also a carrier of the above so the conversation (I have several reasons mostly my genetics are fucked and my family is being studied genetically for also mitochondrial disease) with female friends about not having kids is always a awkward one for sure. There is a fb group for ladies w/ hemophilia but it is very small and not very active.  Wow VwD and Factor VIII deficient and a carrier?  Talk about piling it on.  Nice to meet you and thank you for technically doubling the total of female hemophiliacs I have met.   So sorry to hear this- i imagine one must be difficult on it is own let alone two. Do you mind me asking, does the blood disorder and/ being a carrier bring on the food allergies or would this be separate? It is great to hear there is a fb group for ladies with hemophilia- given that in general most people perceive hemophilia to be a male only disorder not realising that it also affects women and symptoms can be grave. Thank you for commenting and I hope to hear from you. Wow this was one great location for a camp! I imagine it could get rather lonely for those who suffer from the disorder given how rare it is although suffering from any disorder cant be easy. I am used to it at this point. I do not believe they are affiliated. Scientists and Dr's are still trying to figure out what causes food allergies. Yea I  have had people tell me I could not possibly have a bleeding disorder because I am female. My response normally is well my hematologist would disagree. My mother - now nearly 80 - is a Haemophilia A carrier and I am a haemophiliac.\n\nAbout 25 years ago, she was tested as part of a genetic study, and it turns out she has a bleeding disorder too.

It was pretty much a non-event from a bleed perspective. Had a root canal a few years back (severe A) before I switched to Hemlibra and I probably dosed with Factor VIII recombinant beforehand but I do not recall any bleeding.  I probably would not take anything else on Hemlibra unless my HTC told me I should.  The process was not nearly as bad as all the \"I would rather have a root canal\" jokes lead you to believe.

Several phase 1 clinical trial for factor 8 gene therapy approaches are being announced and a couple have early phase 1 results.   Yeah, as I said many years ago when I was drunk: I will see it when I believe it. But from what I see, the results are not upto the mark as to what they were expecting which really raises the doubt if the effect of the treatment is indeed life lasting. I am in my late twenties. Even if it only gives me 5-10 years of not needing factor and giving my joints a rest, I will happily take that. The vector options are a concern.  If you cannot do more than one pass before 80% of recipients develop a neutralizing ab, then you are correct, but if we can go 10 years with AAV and then give a patient a lentivirus and get another 10 years, and then a future vector, we can start at age 25 and get to middle age at least.   \n\nEven if all we can get is an enduring level of 15%, we stop all or most spontaneous joint bleeds and we decrease the number of bleeds from minor injuries.

Sometimes, I feel like the side effects make it not even worth it to take the medication (usually to help control my menstrual cycle). Does anyone else have similar experiences? I have heard of headache and some other side affects. Some people do say it makes it not worth taking. I am not sure what you can do about it.

I could probably keep going but why is not there just one standard *correct* way to stop a bloody nose that they teach you in med school/nursing school I am old school, pinch the bridge, lean head back and count to 60. Repeat until bleeding stops. I was thought this method by a nurse in 70s and it works for me. With hemophilia, titling the head back just seems like your asking to fill your belly up with blood.\n\nI just do the same thing if I cut myself, apply pressure and wait for it to stop. (I am not a hemophiliac) if I need to use both hands I put some toilet paper up my nose to catch the blood. When you pinch the nose it stops the bleeding, hold it long enough and it stops. If it is real bad I use a cold washcloth. it tightens up the blood vessels, like ice packs do for other bleeds. Did not think about that. After so many years, the easiest solution for me has been to just roll a single square of toilet paper up in to a plug. Small enough for me to just forget about it for a while and not play with it.

Results came back homozygous (2 copies of the variant). I do not have any obvious symptoms but I also thankfully have never needed surgery or had any physical trauma up to this point. It seems that XIII is pretty rare so just wondering if anyone here has it and what their experience has been. This is great advice, thanks for sharing. I am still a bit in shock, as I have never had to think about these things before. Good to know that a lot of doctors may not be familiar. This was found during fertility testing, I am being referred to a hemotologist now. The information online is scarce and frankly frightening. The medical bracelet is a great tip. Have you only had issues with major injuries or smaller bleeds as well? Just curious as I have never had issues with small cuts or while giving blood. Very interesting, I had no idea it could take so long to present symptoms, as I am 33 myself. Really appreciate the info on what to expect. Hi! I am factor XIII, also found while we were going through fertility testing after multiple loses. I do have some bleeding issues, I have severe menorrhagia and I bruise very easily, nose bleeds, headaches, fun stuff. We wound up going with gestational surrogacy to have our child. My main experience is only finding a very small number of doctors who have even heard of Factor XIII. So getting treatment has been less than fun. So does that mean that you are a carrier for hemophilia A? Or that you have hemophilia A? Either way it is essentially the same difference. What you should have tested is your factor VIII level. That will tell you how severe your bleeding issues will be and what your dose of replacement factor VIII should be for various bleeding issues. The most common type of hemophilia is hemophilia A, factor VIII deficiency. But it is rare in women. It is more likely you are a carrier, meaning your sons could have hemophilia. But carriers often have mild hemophilia (low factor VIII level). Hemophilia treatment is very specialized , so it is recommended to find the hemophilia treatment center nearest you and make an appointment. Chances are they will know a lot more than anyone else. Thanks for chiming in! May I ask, what led you to surrogacy? Also any tips for how you found a doctor who is experienced? The fact that I am homozygous (2 copies) means I have it. From what I have read Factor XIII is a little different in that my blood clots normally, but then the clot breaks down, leading to excessive bleeding. I am not sure what the treatment options are but I will definitely talk to a hematologist. 7+miscarriages with one almost leading me to dying. We clot easily with factor XIII, I form clots between my uterine lining and embryo. The clot tore loose but did not completely rip loose the embryo, but that led to a bleed and infection got in. I turned septic. Fun stuff. \n\nI went to the NHF meetup and met some other Factor XIII folk who told me about a doctor in Houston and another in California. I went and saw the one in Houston. He pretty much told me that because there are so few of us worldwide that it is not financially interesting for anyone to do much research. I am sorry you went through all of that. I have been lucky thus far that none of my losses have come with complications. That is frustrating to hear that no doctors are willing to do research on this.  I am pretty heartbroken to hear this probably means a healthy pregnancy is not possible but I appreciate you sharing your story so I know what to expect. Ah. I knew something looked funny. I know nothing about that one. A few things:\n\n1. Definitely follow through with your hematologist referral, they will have the best advice. That said, if you are in the US, you are one of about 150 *total* FXIII patients. So do not be surprised if the hematologist has not seen a FXIII, even if they are at a hemophilia treatment center (HTC). The leading FXIII expert in the US is ( at CHOC in Los Angeles. I would ask your hematologist to consult with her, if possible.\n2. Connect with ( They offer programs for ultra rare bleeding disorders, including FXIII, and they can connect you with providers and other patients.\n3. There are two good FXIII medications, Tretten and Corifact. Once-monthly IV dosing, can be done at home similar to hemophilia meds. This is such great information, thank you for sharing! Dr. Nugent frequently speaks on FXIII at national conferences in the US and has facilitated the FXIII pre-con at NHF's Bleeding Disorder Conference in the past. I do not know much about Factor XI deficiency (aka hemophilia C) or who the experts are, but ( has some good info. I would look at the reference section to see who is publishing...Paula Bolton-Maggs in the UK shows up a few times, maybe email to ask who is her US counterpart. NHF or HFA are also good resources.

I was born in a 3rd world country where no one knew what hemophilia is. When I was six months old, I fell off stairs and got a in my upper lip. \nEven though my dad was in medical field too they could not figure out what was wrong with me. \nI did not stop bleeding for a while.  After sometimes one of the doctor decided to give me fresh blood. My dad and I have same blood type so he gave me blood. After receiving it my bleeding immediately start getting better. Doctors had to send my blood over to Sweden to find out I was a hemophiliac. \nGrowing up in 3rd world country our only hope was ice, cryo and plasma. We got factors donated by people from 1st world country as they would see our suffering back home. \nDue to hemophilia, my parents moved me to USA to get better health treatment. \nDue to untreated bleeds in my right knee and my left knee, it caused major arthritis. I have gotten my replaced at the age of 18. Now my left ankle is taking a toll. \nI am on profi now. I infuse 2-3 times a week. I am so grateful my parents brought me here and I am getting all the medicine I need and all the help I need. \n\nBut today my friends, I woke up with a spontaneous bleed. Huge bleed in my targeted joint left ankle. I live in a dorm on campus with 4 other students. I was ready to start my day of going class/gym and work. \nI cannot get up and step even a bit on my left. There is bleed behind my ankle. It is a horrible joint at this point. My factors are in my car. When I get better I will go to my car and infuse myself. \n\nI have got chance to meet so many people like us in the community thru summer camps and meetings. It helps to know you are not alone. \nI do not know how I will get on thru my day today but wish my luck guys. \nIf you want to get connected with me I would love to talk with other hemophiliacs while I am on my bed icing. It is important to get that factor in you ASAP man. I am sure you know that. Hope you get better soon.  You need to check out Hemlibra. You have my sympathies and I have to say that you have such a positive attitude. \nI am glad you got a dose of factor.  Make sure to keep it handy. I am on Hemlibra and it is amazing, but I saw the bill to my insurance company today. 70K for 1 months worth. We need to stand up more on this atrocious pricing on our medicine. This medicine is life changing, but yet they are getting outrageous amounts for it. I know I am not paying that, but it does not matter. That price tag keeps it out of reach for many who could benefit greatly from it and live a closer to normal life. We need to stand together and demand these companies be less greedy amd help more people. That pricing is insane for this drug no matter how good it is.\n\nI am also sick and tired of companies treating me like I am different than them. I run circles around most able bodied people, mostly because I feel like I have more to prove, but that is beside the point. We push harder than anyone and we thrive, we dont need to be treated like we are special. We just need proper medication to move forward in life, but corporate greed is making that harder and harder with each advancement. We are not someone science experiment or the thing that makes them feel warm and cozy when they go to sleep at night like they did something that day. These $800 doctor appointments and outrageous medication has to stop and it needs to stop yesterday. Glad you got it treated. Yea, hemophilia can feel like a curse but I would not trade what I have learned from the pain and patience for a hemophilia free life. The Buddha said something like- The path to enlightenment is through suffering. So in that sense, it is a blessing. In my opinion these bleeds behind ankles are so bad. When i start getting a bleed behind the ankle area i dont feel anything but wont be able to take even one step with ankle. For me it was actually surprising to see how \"cheap\" it was in comparison to my previous meds (Eloctate were around $50k each when I was on that profi). Hemlibra has been wonderful though. Still way more expensive than Recombinant or Advate, though. But those are not strong enough for me anymore. I would have chosen Canada, but whatever works. Happy you are on the mend!

Are ther companies that make protective clothing for babies/children with this disease?  Some companies sell helmets for infants with bleeding disorders to prevent them from head injuries.  Found this article that included information about a company that makes padded clothing to protect children. Hope it helps! \n\n This is just a part of the rest of their life. Treat them as normal as you can, research the best ways to protect their joints. This will be the biggest factor they face in adult hood. Even the helmet will not help that much with internal bleeding, I have always argued against them in the sense of a false security in the Childs mind causing them to take extra risk. I understand the feeling of wanting to protect them but tell them to try not to go overboard with it. I am a severe type B and I played tackle football, skateboarded and did all the things normal kids did (more than I should have to my own admission). He will pay for it with bleeds occasionally but I do not regret a single second of anything I did. If you or they have any questions feel free to message me. Also, you will want your friend's grandson to be part of the gang as he grows up.  If your neighbors only see him wearing a helmet the parents and grandparents in the area may read that as \"special\".  This would translate into the other kids in the neighborhood thinking and acting as if it were true and suddenly he turns into the weird kid on the corner that no one wants to play with. This is a huge issue for my family right now. We know the kids cannot do all the \"normal\" activities that other kids can, but what limitations do you put on. How will those limitations effect how he perceives life.  I wore knee pads when I was old enough to run, but stopped using them for most activities once I stopped falling so much. Used normal safety gear for activities like rollerblading (elbow pads and such). I started factor infusions at 9 months old, treated on demand for a few years and then switched to prophylaxis some time around 4 I think. Once I was on proph, I did not get injured so easily and could live a relaticwly normal childhood.  Exactly.  With this generation of boys, it is really important to realize that football is probably out for more than just boys with health issues.  Most parents who read the news know about head trauma and are thinking twice about contact sports.  \n\nBy making your kid feel like he is the frailest of flowers, he will miss the boat on taking up sports that are growing (like trapshooting and cross country) for fear that he will be injured.  \n\nYou cannot be stupid, if your kid has an idiot PE teacher, you have to pull them.  If your PE teacher is smart and forward thinking and does non contact activities and teaches kids to be healthy and fit for life, then you need your son to be of a mind to jump right in. Kid can do all activities just should not be smashing his head on shit for fun. I was in wrestling and did well until junior year when I tore a ligament in my groin and realized being able to have sex is more important. With factor as strong and available as it is for most people it is almost a non-issue nowadays it seems like. Even with joint issues? I have a terrible ankle from soccer. Sports are hard on everyone, some sports like soccer and football are even harder than others. 28 y.o. with severe type A and 4 arthritic joints here. Do not treat him any different. Find him a good hemophilia treatment center, and let him do what he wants. Educate him about the risks without scaring him away from trying things. No contact sports is a good rule of thumb, but he is going to get a lot of injuries over his life and that is ok. Let him live. Now a bad inhibitor is a bit different story in terms of what he can do, but it should be the same in terms of what he is encouraged to do. Do not treat him any different than you otherwise would.  I have arthritis from bleeds in both ankles and elbows and i still mountain bike and snowboard. Cannot run for shit but that is ok. He will figure out what he should and should not do with the help of his hemotologist. As long as he treats properly and there is no inhibitor his joints should not get too bad. Mine did because i was bad about treating when i should have. Oh to start again... Thank you all for your thoughts.

This year my cousin on my Mom's side was confirmed as a carrier for Hemophilia. They are now testing her Mom. I was planning on trying for children next summer but now I do not know if I should wait or not. \n\nI am really stressed about this decision since many of my aunts (and my Mother) have needed complete hysterectomies by the time they were in their 30's. I am 26.\n\nSo either I risk being a carrier myself, wait to long and I am not able to have children, or hope the testing process is fast enough.\n\nAny advice, opinions, or clarifications on the DNA testing process would be amazing.  Would being a carrier make you not want to have children? I honestly do not know. I would just feel so guilty if I did. I am probably making a big deal out of it :/  Well obviously it is different for each person but as a former severe now moderate B patient, I can honestly say that it has not held me back from doing anything I have wanted to. There going to be inconveniences sure, prophylaxis is not a picnic. There will be activities you might not want your child to take part in but honestly the experiences I have had in my life and the people I have met along the way far outweigh any of that. That helps a lot. My entire family has been freaking out about it since my cousin's baby got diagnosed. Like we need to put everything on hold until we trace it. (There were no known cases of it in our family so it took everyone by surprise) \n\nThank you for sharing your experience, it helps a lot. \n\n And as a counterbalance, my life is filled with constant, daily pain and it has held me back immensely. If I had the power to go back in time and tell my mother to not have me and adopt instead, I would. Without hesitation.\n\nThis is a genetic disease we are talking about. Sure, the future looks good in treating it, but to 100% make sure it does not go on to a new generation (barring mutations) is to not have a genetic child of your own. My mom got a hysterectomy after my diagnosis, so I am an only child. I have made the choice that no family member of mine will EVER have to suffer like I did and I am not having children. This ends with me.\n\nI have seen my friends die because of the AIDS epidemic. And even though factor is now man made for the most part, you never know what could happen in the future to the clotting factor, shortages included. And I have not even mentioned inhibitors yet.\n\nI would talk to a hemotologist more than a message board. We can only give you wildly different, anecdotal evidence. Everyone has had a different life with this disease depending on which decade they were born in, and it varies even more with severity. But, like I said, the only sure way (barring mutation) to stop future generations from getting hemophilia is to stop making hemophiliacs. Very good points. I understand that A sufferers tend to have a harder time of it than B sufferers. The financial costs also had not occured to me as fortunately I live in the UK so all of my treatment is free on the NHS.

(right?)\n\nI have talked to my family doctor but he said that my cousin's medical team would contact/test family members as they figure out more. I will just mention my concerns and plans of having kids in the next year to my cousin. \n\nThank you so much for sharing your experience!  delete If you are stressing out about it, you should just go get some blood drawn and be tested for it or not. You can have the results within a matter of days. It is a 50% chance if your mom is a carrier.  No problem, I did not want to put too much of a downer, but it is an aspect. Each generation is better than the last when it comes to breakthroughs, but you cannot definitely predict the future. If I could suggest something, I know your family doctor has your best interests at heart, but from my history, when it comes to hemophilia they know next to nothing. So, if it is at all possible (if it was ok with your cousin) I would contact their hematologist and talk to them. Or if they are far away talk to your nearest one. They can give you direct answers and can help at every step. They can even set you up to talk to other carriers 1 on 1. And possibly, if it is a different office, they can test you sooner.\n\n Hopefully, your tests will be fine. My mom's sister and my grandma's sisters were not carriers. The odds are in your favor, and I hope it works out. But, if your tests are positive, your local hemophilia clinic has many avenues to help you at every step, and they can help you now as well.  That is great advice, thank you! The fact that I have two brothers without gives me hope but you never know. I will definitely be talking to more people and experts to get answers sooner.\n\nThank you again, I really appreciate it!  It is not a big deal anymore. It was, but it really is not.  Get the genetic mutation that your cousin has.  This saves a pile of cash and makes insurance companies much more inclined to pay for your testing.  Once your family knows what specific mutation you are at risk for, then you test his mother to see if he is a new mutation (30&amp;#37; of all patients are this) or not.  If your aunt is not a carrier and your mom is not a carrier, then unless you have a new mutation different from your cousin, then you are not at risk.  If you are at risk, you have a 50&amp;#37; chance of inheriting the mutation.  \n\nGiven the progress in hemophilia, I would not panic too much.    Even if you are a carrier, you have a 50&amp;#37; chance of having either a normal boy or girl with each pregnancy.  And if your child is an affected boy, you will still have a wonderful new son that will bring you great joy.  He may need medicine, but he will be a treasure to you.  \n\nWith prophy factor, boys who in past generations were crippled by the adulthood are now getting college scholarships in sports.

As a person with non-immgrant visa, is there a way for me to get clotting factor? How does it work? Whenever we have travelled, we have always taken enough factor to last the entire trip (plus a couple of extra doses). Our hospital has never had an issue giving us enough factor for the trip, I would guess this is your safest bet. Coming into the US, you should be able to bring in as much product as you will need to cover your time here. I would have a valid prescription with you. I have not had any problem bringing factor into our out of the U.S when vacationing internationally.

I mean, we do that anyway, in my own research I have come to the conclusion that Hemophilia has no effect on the male libido despite knowing several hemos with robust progeny.

", "Travelling on international flight with factor VIII &amp; Hemlibra Hi,\n\nMy son is having severe Hemophilia A. We are currently residing in US &amp; we plan to travel to India. \n\nCan we carry the factor &amp; Hemlibra along with us on a International flight in Carry-on ( cabin ) bag with a 6-month dosage.  Has anyone traveled on International flight with the medication. Was there any problems or issues in security clearance. Most probably we will have a transit in the gulf country. So I wanted to know if anyone has carried the medication of this size with them. It is been a long time since I did a international flight with factor. Last time I did I had a note from my HTC about the medication as well as talked to TSA ahead of time. The letter from the htc made it easier to get through customs. I travelled two times in the past 2 years woth haemophilia. I got a letter from my doctor in advance. On that, she stated my condition and my medicine as well.\n\nI prepared all the stuff that I needed into my compact medicine bag (  ( ), and put the whole thing into a plastic bag.\n\nThey never had any problem with this. In fact, they never looked into the med pack. \n\nThis is all inside the EU, so I cannot tell anything outside Europe. Can I ask where you bought that medicine bag? I have traveled internationally with factor a few times and never had any trouble at customs. Customs knows what they are looking at. If anything they will take issue with how much liquid you may have with you. I have found traveling abroad they tend not to care about lyophilized powder in vials, they know it is probably medicine, as it all typically looks a certain way. I got it for free in my hospital. A lot of this depends on exactly how much medication you are carrying with you - are the hemlibra doses 1/2/4 weeks? Assuming your son does not need factor regularly and you are bringing a Just In Case supply, how many doses? Six months is a very long time, not sure if it will all be in India.\n\nYou will be tempted to break down the vials/components to save space, but on the off chance that you get pulled by customs it will be easier to explain if they are in their original packaging. I have taken like month of advate (12 doses, so 60 ml?) in and out of US for traveling multiple times (about 6?). I was only questioned once, and when I told TSA agent that I had hemophilia, he did not even care to check. So I think you probably will not run into any issue. I would still take a documentation from your HTC regarding the medicine and your son's condition just in case. I flew to Bangalore from the US a few months back with no problems. I carried 8 doses of factor with sharps and medical supplies and was not even questioned. Just make sure you have a letter from your doctor just in case. i have traveled tons with factor in a variety of forms. To be prepared, I have a \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d letter from my doc about my medical need to travel with factor and etc. \n\nonce it is recognized as medical supplies I have never had a problem with volume of fluid or otger utems mentioned above. \n\nLPT: I know many people wear whatever to travel, but since I get apprehensive about the same type of things as OP, I make a point of dressing as I would to go to a business meeting. \n**It never hurts to look like your sh*t is together when dealing with arbitrary authority in need of enlightenment. (you can quote me on that)** I have seen similar bags given to customers/patients(*custotients? pastomers?*) from companies that make factor - maybe ask at your HTC if they have anything like that I just went to Malaysia a few months ago and have traveled abroad with factor a lot. Get a letter from your son\u2019s hemophilia doctor stating the reason for the medicine and it is importance. Your doctor will have done a lot of these and will know exactly what to right.\n\nOther than that you will be fine. I have only had problems once at degualle airport in Paris. Even then, the security just harassed me for about ten minutes and then let me go. Thank you for your valuable inputs. As most of you mentioned a letter from HTC would help, so I will work with my HTC to get this for my son. \n\nSince we are carrying 6 months of factor dosage, to make enough space, can we just carry the inner case by removing it from the box that manufacturer provides. This will help us to manage the space. Will it cause any problems in the customs or security clearance due to lack of original manufacturer packaging. Thanks for your response. \n\nDid you carry the factor in the original manufacturer's box or you just carried the inner box. Just checking so that we can arrange medication within the cabin bags. \n\nAlso did you let the airport security staff at Bangalore to scan the bag through the machine or did you opt for manual check. I took them out of the box and just had the inner containers. I put it all in my carry-on which went through the normal scanning by airport security. Is it safe to scan the factor through those machines ? I was under impression that we should not scan it. Also they might see the liquid if they scan it &amp; then they might open the bag to see it right. As Indian who traveled to Dubai with Hemlibra. Both customs only asked what the medicine was and for the Doctors letter, make sure to mention the amount you are carrying in the Doctors letter. If you have Doctors letter custom will to give no you trouble at all. And i carried hemlibra outside of the box in my handbag Thanks for your response. This is very helpful.

Hi all,\n\nDo anyone have any experience with Jivi?\nMy doctor wants me to switch to Jivi next month from regular F8 2000 U / 3 times week. I was informed that Jivi is a half life treatment factor. I will still take it 3 times pr. week. \n\nMy biggest concern is that Jivi contains this so called PEGylation attachment that can be traced in human body aften longer use. \n\nI believe that all half life products are using same method. Anyone with any experience with these type of treatments?\n\nThanks! All drugs have a half life. I think what you are referring to is an \"extended half-life\" product. Your regular FVIII product would be considered a standard half-life product. \n\nThere are a lot of drugs in many different therapeutic areas that are PEGylated or glycoPEGylated. If you would prefer to not use a PEGylated product, consider Eloctate. It is an extended half-life FVIII product that is not PEGylated. In my state (mid-Atlantic area, Eloctate is by far the most commonly used extended half-life product. \n\nFrom UpToDate: \n\n&gt;A recombinant product composed of factor VIII fused with a monomeric human immunoglobulin (IgG1) Fc domain (rFVIII-Fc; **Eloctate**) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 for treatment of bleeding, prevention of bleeding, and perioperative management of patients with hemophilia A. This product binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn, present on many adult cell types) via its Fc domain, and this binding protects the factor from degradation, extending the half-life of factor VIII 1.5- to 1.7-fold.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;A recombinant product composed of factor VIII covalently fused to one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules (**Adynovate**) was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in individuals 12 years of age and older with hemophilia A, which was expanded in 2016 to include children &lt;12 years. The PEG molecules extend the half-life by 1.4 to 1.5-fold. Studies in the setting of on-demand therapy or surgery have shown this product to be safe and hemostatically effective. A glycoPEGylated product (**Esperoct**) was approved in 2019. PEGylation and glycoPEGylaton differ in the site to which the PEG moiety is added (amino group of the protein versus carbohydrate, respectively)  \n\nIn reality, insurances need to start covering Hemlibra (emicizumab) for the general hemophilia A population. Disclaimer: not a doctor, do not take medical advice from me or any stranger on the internet. \n\nFor me, I am a young adult with severe hemophilia A but I have always bled more like a moderate. I use Jivi with a dosing rate of 2500 IU per 4 days. (it is an odd one but it works) I have had very few bleeds since I started using it and it is let me infuse less frequently due to that extended half-life. Overall, it is working for me. I do not have experience with Jivi but is your current product not working well?  If you still have to stick yourself 3x a week, why bother switching to something else?  Just thinking out loud.  Sorry I cannot offer any real advice about the product. I am covered for Hemlibra. I take it once a week , subQ. It is easy. I still get the occasional bleed but I do a lot less  actor now and have way less bleeds. I used a pegylated Factor before. It was literally life changing. Not as many infusions as needed under regular recombinant and that was also when I was closest to living like a normal human. Prior to that I was averaging 1 bleed per week. However the staff had concerns over the long term impact of pegylated molecules in the body and anyway there were a lot of blood tests after that so most if not all of those pegylated factor should be long gone from my system. I heard that they may stick in body forever. That is the reason why they do not give it to kids under 12 years old. That is my biggest concern. What are you on now?  Thanks for the info man! I will see if I can get that product here too. It is because this Kovaltry is expiring and I need to change. I had a crappy half-life with regular factor so I had to switch to EHL.. I am on a peg product.\n\nI was super tired for a month or so add my body adjusted. So glad I was switched as it cut down bleed rate a lot .

My husband and I took a foster placement of a 14 month old on Sunday and told \u201che gets big bruises but it is not a big deal.\u201d On Monday we receive a diagnosis of Hemophilia Type A, severe. \n\nThey will be putting a port in to prophy dose 3x weekly. We are currently at the hospital getting factor bc he toddled right into a cabinet. \n\nAny advice on medical treatments? Activities? General parenting tips? I am usually a very carefree parent but suddenly can see myself wrapping him in a bubble. I think it is an added layer when it is someone else child too. \n\nAnything you have for me would be super!  He is a normal kid who bruises easily. I am severe type A. The insurance part used to be way worse but that is kind of fixed now for the most part, and if your insurance is not good enough there are some groups that cover factor related medical costs. Other than that, just treat him like any other kid. Monitor bleeds and common injury areas if you can in a journal, the htcs like that. Ports can have issues, but sticking a child is traumatizing so there is a toss up.  What kind of issues with ports? The Peds hematologist we work with made it sound like that was really the only option. Also we had to do IV factor tonight Andy was an absolute disaster so I am not thrilled about that as an alternative.  I had ports for ten years. No problems except for right at the end when I had an '''extremely''' rare and unusual issue with it and it had to be removed  (basically a port is a metal anchor disc with a tube that goes between the disc and your vein. The tube detached and went on a journey around my body). It was so rare that I was written up in a medical journal. Please do not worry too much about ports. :)\n\nMy veins were really small as a kid so it was ports or bust basically. At school etc it was just one of those things - some of my friends referred to it as my \"third nipple\" but I was never actually made fun of for it.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is ports becoming clogged or infected - make sure to always wipe the port with alcohol before inserting the needle, and flush the port with saline before and after injecting factor. We have two boys (age 2.5 and 5) with severe type A, It is scary at first, and bubble-wrapping was also our first thought :-)  \nBut as /u/Usually_lurks12 said, he is a normal kid who bruises easily, as long as you keep good track of big bruises and especially joint bleeds, you will do fine, and he will too.\n\nKeeping a strict profylaxis regime will significantly reduce joint bleeds and bruises. Both our boys receive doses 3x a week through ports and generally only show minor bruises and joint bleeds are very rare. They are active, playful and overall happy kids who just bruise easily. Thanks! We get the port put in the 16 and will do 3x a week. Im glad to hear that will help in the long run too.  Yea it took six nurses last night all trying to even locate a vein they wanted to use and it did not go very well so I think that is a problem also. Thanks for tips.  yeah it is not fun seeing a little child being surrounded by doctors and nurses all unable to locate a vein. That can become very traumatizing for you and the child... For a child with difficult veins a port is a very good solution  Find you if you have a hemophilia \u201cfoundation\u201d chapter close to where you live, they are a wealth of information and support. \n\nIf you are not already at a real hemophilia treatment center try to get to one of those a garden variety hemotologist, the child\u2019s long term health outcomes should be better at a HTC. \n\nSevere A is no reason to bubble wrap. Many of us lead very active life styles. I rode my bicycle from San Francisco to San Diego several years in a row, it 600+ mi in a week. This ^ Surrounding yourself with people who have experience and access to resources will reduce your stress tremendously. That is what kept my mom sane through my childhood. Do not let them just do whatever they want. Be his advocate. I regret making my son get a port that ultimately he did not need because they came out with a subcutaneous method. Ask for Hemlibra. DONT GET THE PORT ID YOU DONT HAVE TO. They just cleared Hemlibra for non inhibitor patients and it has completely changed out life for the better.

I have had what I now recognize as bleeds growing up after surgeries/injuries but no one ever picked up on it as being anything except an expected surgical risk. I have a few questions for other people who are mild or symptomatic carriers in a similar range.\n\n\\-I have chronic joint pain, but I do not know if that is due to bleeds or something else. How do you know if joint pain is due to a bleed?\n\n\\-My hematologist has not said anything about any treatments except for when I have to have some upcoming surgical and dental procedures. Do any of you with similar Factor IX levels infuse or take something like Stimate? I do not really spontaneously bleed to my knowledge aside from nosebleeds or if I hurt myself, and even then though bleeding can go on for a bit, it has not really to a concerning amount. I have to give myself weekly subQ injections for an unrelated issue and have bruising related to this, but again has not been terribly concerning since it is always been that way for me.\n\nThanks! Hi! Welcome! Disclaimer that I am not a doctor but I will try my best\n1) are you talking about current bleeds, or damage from past bleeds?  Current bleeds tend to start with a tingly or \u201cfuzzy\u201d feeling (at least for me) and if untreated end up with swelling and pain while bending or putting weight on the joint.  The definite test of is it a bleed for me is: does it resolve immediately with factor?  Chronic joint pain may be due to repeated bleeds, or to other causes.  That is a q for your Dr. \n\n2) Stimate is not used for hemophilia B, only VWD or mild A.  Learning to self infuse is a great idea in case of emergency.  My factor level is 5% so I infuse regularly.  But it depends on the individual.  If you are having ongoing joint pain and bruising, consider infusing more often than your factor level may \u201csay\u201d.\n\n3) Highly recommend an HTC as they are the hemophilia EXPERTS and see lots of patients like you, so they are best equipped to answer these types of questions.  \n\nFeel free to DM! I do not know if this is an agreed upon belief , but I am as sure of it as anything- yes, if you have 12% factor and you have joint soreness it is from bleeds. At least some of it, likely most of not all of it. At 12% you will bleed but they will not get so bad that you are forced to stay off of it. They are called micro bleeds, and you probably get them a lot. I am severe A, less than 1%. But since I have been taking Hemlibra , my percentage acts more like what someone with 30-40% has. I still get micro bleeds and they are difficult to deal with because they do not present as a problem, but they do damage over time because they do not get treated seriously. After 45 years of bleeds I know what to look for and how bleeds feel. I am sure that small bleeds go un noticed , yet do damage over time. I am not sure what the answer is for you. If I were you I would probably go on a long acting factor and infuse once a week. If you are able to get access to it.\nAnd work with a treatment center. Most hematologists do not know enough about hemophilia. They might think they do, but there is a lot to know. You should talk to a specialist, and even then try to find the best. I would think that the bigger the city, the better the HTC, just because of the experience they will have from dealing with so many cases. UC Davis HTC was one of the best I have been to. Thanks! I have another appointment with a hematologist on Monday, so will try to ask him. I have never infused factor, so cannot really use that as a metric to assess if the pain is bleed-related. No swelling, but definitely pain with bending and weight. But that could also be many other things... This is good advise^ Hey friend, I am a mild A around 10-12% as well. I do not know how old you are, but I am 32 and only within the past three years started taking my hemophilia seriously. I foolishly told myself that \u201cI am just a mild, I do not need to worry\u201d, which mostly worked... until it did not. I hooked up with my HTC and they have been really great, but I am noticing more and more pain issues that are most likely due to untreated ankle bleeds from when I was a kid. They are hesitant to teach me to self-infuse, because I have never done it before. I agree with u/blueishblackbird that you have probably been having bleeds your whole life that have probably led to weird physiological problems that you can probably still deal with. I have been working with a physical therapist from my HTC and also with an athletic trainer to deal with long-standing postural issues and imbalances that I probably developed over the years because of my ankles. I definitely agree! \nIt would be worth being seen at an HTC - they will sort physio referrals and give you a joint health check. They will also talk you through treatment options, like if you need to learn to infuse. Definitely the best way to ensure you get good care going forward! On point one, active bleeds in a joint, I think you will know. I say this because my own factor is at 13%, so I did not experience a joint bleed until my later teens. Having said that, I had a fall, hit my hip, and tried to walk when what felt like hot, molten glass or sand was flowing through my veins. It is such a distinctive and unusual sensation that unless it is a very mild bleed, I am not sure how it could be missed, especially once you can see the joint. \n\nBecause mine is also classed as mild and was not caught until age 18/19, there was some joint damage in areas that had repeated injury despite the lack of obvious joint bleeds (Eg: wrists). They suggested imaging to confirm, and, when I balked at the cost, they were able to get me into the NIH study on bleeding disorders (this was 10 years post original diagnosis). I would recommend seeing if you are eligible for the program as it covers most costs, and all of your samples are entered into a bank, meaning as you age, there are physical samples from you available 10, 15, 30 years down the road for comparison. I am mostly doing it to aid with the cost of treatment, but it seems like a good safety net and one of the few ways I can assist with hemophilia research. I am B Severe with a very detectable bleed difference so not sure this will apply/help you too much. \n\nMy arthritic/joint pain is a very sharp pain with a soft mobility restriction. Meaning it will hurt to extend/retract the joint but will not be limited in range.\n\nMy bleed pain comes with swelling and throbbing pain. Mobility is very limited and cannot move past a certain point. The pain level also has a wider range and can get very severe where arthritic cannot.\n\nRegardless of whether you spontaneously bleed or not just make sure you have some type of factor and the ability to administer it fast or be able to get to someone fast who can. If you get into an accident or have any type of head injury it can be life saving.\n\nI would probably recommend checking out an HTC at least once to see if it fits you. Best of luck to you. Joint bleed means the whole joint is swollen and hot. Really swells up. For example\n\n\n\nNot me.", "PSA: INTRANASAL DDAVP IS COMING BACK SOON  I am getting sick of injections give me dat stuff Where have you seen this? Hold up - I thought it was only certain brands that went away? My hematologist filled my prescription for my nasal spray earlier this year and did not mention anything about it. Should I not use it? What is this? Treatment for VWB ???? They all went off the market due to higher concentration than it was supposed to be. Not sure why your doctor was able to do that. My hematologist told me FUCKING SAME Well, oops. He filled it in like March, so maybe it was off market after that? It did well at preventing any bleeding after the surgery I got it for, and I did not die, so I guess we are all good lol. Lol It was recalled in August of 2020. Depending when your pharmacy had ordered, they may of had a lot not affected by the recall. If you still have the bottle, you can check it against the FDAs recall ( STAQ Pharma has nasal DDAVP now(Since I think September). It is \"cheap\"(compared to most factor lol), but expiration is bad and last I checked they are not licensed in all 50 states. It could be worth asking your pharmacy if they can get it. That is actually what I am getting soon until the good stuff comes out I am surprised many of you use this. I have not used Stimate in 15 years or so. Once I started infusing factor, it seemed pointless to use Stimate when it barely helps at all. \nAre you guys getting real relief/help from using it? What scenarios do you use it? Do you use it in conjunction with factor infusing?   I am happy for all of you who seem to really love it though! I know it is been tough for all of you! I do not love Stimate personally. Factor works 100x better. But I do not like being infused and it is also good for when I cannot get infused in that moment.", "hemophilia, ankle replacement, CRPS Hi All, \n\nI have not really used reddit much before, but I am looking for people that have had a similar experience to me and I thought this might be a place to find it. \n\nMy husband is 32 with severe type A hemophilia. He has a target bleed spot in his left ankle and had a total ankle replacement there in April of this year. I know this is relatively new for hemophiliacs to have done, so there may not be any of you here. I am just wondering if anyone else has had this done and how it went. My husband was recently diagnosed with CRPS. He is in so much pain that he still cannot walk again. We are moving on to treating the CRPS and have some things to try.

I will try to remember to post here again when there are updates. The replacement itself seemed to have been successful but for some reason he still has pain. His doctors have decided that reason is CRPS. So far, he is had a sciatic nerve block. That helped the pain, but only for a day.

I have a history of BAD bleeding noses, especially when I was a teenager. I get them less frequently now, but when I do they last a long time and usually end with an enormous blood clot. My first miscarriage resulted in me in the ER with uncontrollable bleeding but when I asked about it they just said it was because I was further along (13 weeks). My father, grandmother and great grandmother all had bad bleeding noses like me and I have been anaemic a couple of times ( most recently in March last year).

However the hospital I feel are trying to force us to go to hemlibra. As I understand the big benefits of Hemlibra I find it concerning that should emergency treatment is needed it will need to be administered intravenously. Plus a new injection procedure could seriously affect my already anxious child. I am thinking of training for veins but I get hand tremors due to anxiety and feel I would not be able to do it. The port-a-catch will not last forever and it is his second one but the comfort of knowing I can control his bleeds and especially in an emergency gives more security all round and less trauma.\n\nThe consultant (UK) did say when this one packs up it will be taken out.\n\nI feel we have not a choice in staying with the port-a-cath. Does anyone know if we can actually opt for another in the future? Yes you absolutely have a choice. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. Stand up for what you need and fight if you have to. You know what is best for you and your child. Eventually you will need to learn to infuse because in reality it is easier and much safer to access veins than a port, especially when your kid gets a little older. It is really not hard at all. You will get there eventually. And either way Hemlibra is not for everyone. I know a lot of guys who choose to stay on factor because it works. Hemlibra may be easier and less of a hassle for some, but it does not cover you as well as factor. I am using Hemlibra but have had many injuries and even spontaneous bleeds since being on Hemlibra. And I just infuse and all is well. Hemlibra is not a cure. And if anyone tries to tell you it is your only option they are lying to you. By law you have the choice to use whatever you or your insurance can afford. Factor does not necessarily cost more than Hemlibra either. Usually factor costs less depending on how much you use. If you need any help or advice feel free to contact me anytime. I work with hemophiliacs and have Hemophilia myself. I am glad to help. I am a mild Hemophilia A and I infuse myself just as needed, and my previous hematologist tried to push me to Hemlibra as well. I put my foot down because I only have a few bleeding episodes a year and the Recombinate I have been on since age 9 works just fine for me. \n\nI am starting to build up a low level inhibitor though so I may have no choice in the future, but for now I stuck with what I wanted.\n\nAlso send your kid to Hole In The Wall Gang Camp, when he gets a little older they will teach him to infuse and it is an amazing experience for us to meet others our age and not feel so alone in the daily struggles. Yes. You always have a choice with respect to treatment of your child. \nYou can just say thanks but not right now, maybe reconsider when he is older or when the port fails. \n\nThe port is a only a temporary solution so there will be iv infusions eventually\u2026\n\nHemlibra does mean only emergency treatment - but that should be rare, so hopefully very few iv injections so less traumatic/less of a challenge to find a vein. Hemlibra was a great fit for me because I am not very active. The constant low levels of factor work out better for me than the peaks and troughs of Factor8 replacement.\n\nThat being said, most of the damage to my joints has already been done. My bleeding episodes are very rare, but I was very active as a kid, and would have constantly sprained ankles every winter. All that damage really built up. Cannot speak to the choice you have in the UK. But I think you should consider hemlibra. It is life changing. The subcutaneous injections are easy and essentially painless. I would have much preferred that when I was your son's age to my mother poking at my veins and missing, or having problems with my portacath. Yes he will need an IV from time to time. And that is okay. It is easy for you to learn to do it (my mom had problems because my veins were scarred from years of FEIBA) or it can be done by a medical professional if necessary. Those emergencies should be few and far between. \n\nAlso, I had my potacath for 12+ years long after I stopped using it. Just had to be flushed occasionally. But I wish I had gotten it out sooner, the removal was gnarly. I am not sure about your choices. But I am interested to learn more about your concerns. Port-a-caths have a great many potentially VERY serious risks. They are at much higher potential risk than a simple intravenous injection and require upkeep. It is my understanding they have largely fallen out of favor here for those reasons. \n\nWhile you definitely should not let someone pressure you into anything I can tell you from my own experiences that Hemlibra has been amazing for me. I WISH I had had this as a child. I do not bruise hardly at all anymore. My bleeds have basically disappeared. And the injection process is so easy i cannot even compare the two. It is basically like doing insulin injections. The hardest part of Hemlibra has been remembering to take it once a week. When I have a procedure or a serious injury IV dosing clotting factor is no big deal. I was very aware when I asked my Hematologist about it that Hemlibra was still VERY new as far as treatments go. Before I started Hemlibra I read the a bit if the scientific papers about it is development. I looked into it is efficacy rate and how it reduces bleeding episodes. I spoke with staff at Genentech itself. They have a nurse line you can call and ask a bajillion questions to. I would also be happy to answer any questions I can. Or share any experiences I can offer. \n\nAlso, I do not think going to Hemlibra means you HAVE to lose the port-a-cath right away. You might just ask your provider if you can keep it for awhile after the switch. Advocate strongly. Which you seem to being doing well already. Let me start in saying I am not here to scare you.\n\nHemlibra has weird things going on with it.  It has done weird things to me, and another person I have chatted with.   His side effects were too much, so he does not take it anymore.\n\nIt caused me to get chalazions (eyelid fluid filled sacs).  Had to have minor surgery to the eyelid to get them taken out.   Both times this happened was right after giving the \"loading\" dose.  That is where the dose is very large for the first couple of weeks.\n\nThe other guy said he got fluid filled lumps when he injured his foot.   My guess is that it *can* mess with the clotting cascade in different ways.   Since it just creates a bridge between factor 9 and 10, so that the clotting cascade will continue, it is a bit of a Frankenstein drug, for sure.\n\nNow, the question on everyone is mind, is if an injury were to happen by a head injury, could a fluid filled \"bump\" happen in the head?   Yea... That would be bad.  \n\nThere is just so much that is new about this stuff. I have had crazy spontaneous bleeds while taking hemlibra...  Never joint bleeds though!   It is always a muscle though.   And it is a weird thing when it happens.   It starts out like a standard muscle bleed...  but then does not get better until I IV recombinate.  \n\nI am learning more and more, but it seems the bleeds are not related to actually injury as we are used to.   It seems they are something different...   Like an isometric exercise like stretching for a decent period of time, or holding up a phone to your face for an extended period.   It is not an injury, but I am thinking the body \"thinks\" it is an injury, starts the clotting cascade, then something goes wrong.\n\nI am sure they know about this problem well and good, but profits. Hey there. I have two sons with severe hemophilia A. My older son has what I call SEVERE severe hemophilia. He is always needed about 50% more than the normal dose of factor VIII. Both boys have ports and I was taught to infuse both of them, twice a week, and often had to give the oldest much more as he still had severe joint and muscle bleeds. He was on Advate until about three years ago when we switched to Eloctate, which worked better but still allowed a lot of breakthrough bleeds. \n\nThey started Hemlibra in late 2019, and it has completely changed our lives. They do not get bleeds. They barely bruise. I was worried about all the things you are: what if it does not work? What if they have emergencies and need infusions via port? Do I have the heart for ANOTHER way to stab my children with needles? \n\nSo we left their ports in in case of emergency. We flush them every 6-8 weeks to keep them clear. Since we started Hemlibra our oldest has had one muscle bleed and our younger has had zero. For nearly two years now. The ports are still there for my ease of mind, but had we taken them out, we would only have had to go to the hospital once for an IV infusion. \n\nGiving them the Hemlibra is SO MUCH EASIER. It is exactly like getting a vaccination or insulin injection. My older (7) does not even flinch anymore. My younger (4) still cries but is over it in 30 seconds. I numb the area with lidocaine first, and it takes almost no time. Like I said, it has changed our lives.  Feel free to PM me with any questions. I completely and totally understand all your concerns! Huh that is interesting. This is the first I have heard of this.Do you know anyone else with this issue or other people that Hemlibra is not working for? It *is* working, but it also has some serious things that happen with it.\n\nI do not know anyone outside of this reddit with type A  (or B) I had sore joints when I was taking the dose every 2 weeks, so I went to a smaller dose every week and the side effects stopped. I think it was that my body had an immune response to the high dose all at once, so splitting it up and doing less once a week is tolerable. Maybe that could be happening with you as well? I like the weekly dosing better anyway because it is easier to remember - every Friday- instead of every other week . After the factor VIII contamination in the 80s, I would not trust a new hemophilia product for a very long time.  I have distinct memories of the doctors assuring my parents that the contaminated factor was safe and guilting them for not taking me in for infusions more often.  And do not forget, when they could not sell it in America any longer, they simply shipped it to countries with lower safety standards and continued to poison people.  Lives mean nothing, only money.  Your concern is valid.\n\nAlso, I am not trying to scare anyone either.  Just stating facts for posterity, lest the whole debacle be forgotten. I was there.   What you speak of is literally what happened.\n\nMessed up.. I have just built a low level inhibitor and never took hemlibra and this happens to me. Areas where I rarely get bleeds have started bleeding from just basic use of my limbs. I used to always have a natural factor viii of 7-11% now I am averaging around 3% with a Bethesda of .32 for the inhibitor.\n\nI was an alcoholic for about 10 years and just got sober and this started about 2 months into sobriety. Yup you are right on that, I was born on the tail end of the contamination and was not given any factor viii until I was 9 years old. They managed my bleeds with subcutaneous DDAVP and made me ice and elevate. Even after it was over with, my doctor still tested me for hepatitis and HIV frequently. So, you are currently taking Hemlibra, and experience strange bleeds that you have to treat with factor? I am betting the youngins are much more resilient than us oldies who are having problems with Hemlibra.   I am so glad to hear it works for your kiddos - they are so lucky.  Life as a hemophiliac child is incredibly traumatizing. It truly is. I am still careful with them obviously, but they are nearly normal kids now. A fall or a bruise is just\u2026a fall. Or a bruise. As a mom of two of them I cannot even tell you what a relief it is. Them learning to ride bikes\u2026learn to do monkey bars\u2026everything really. It is such a gift. I am so grateful to the researchers and manufacturers. And I am so sorry it does not work for everyone. I am even more thankful after having read the stories of those it has not worked for. No I am not on hemlibra and have the same occurrence. I was saying it because that experience may not be related to hemlibra. oh, i guess it could be, but I am pretty sure it is.  After 40 years of not having a chalazion, and then having 3 which all occurred after taking loading doses, I am pretty sure hemlibra is to blame. The chalazions yes, I was specifically talking about the spontaneous bleeds. I believe for me it is related to an immune response due to the low level inhibitor I am showing. \n\nUnrelated to all this, I started getting something like contact dermatitis but targeted around joints which was a sudden thing too. My doctors do not really know the cause or if it is Hemophilia related. Just random swelling and redness every now and then, but no bleed. Typically occurs close to when I infuse for an injury, but it is not near the injection site or the bleed I infused for.", "Factor VIIII son.. unknowns Hi. I am new here. This is a bit of a long story but wanted to get to know a bit more about the day to day lifestyles of someone with hemophilia B FVIIII. \n\nMy wife and I got married two years ago. Prior to her getting on my insurance her doctors figured why not just run some tests to see if she was ready for pregnancy. Found out she is carrier of hemohila B. So we went thru IVF and now have a baby boy free of hemophilia. Unfortunately we recently had two miscarriages and it is been both financially and emotionally draining. We were contemplating trying naturally. From my understanding it is a 50/50 chance a boy gets that gene. And if so the degree of severity can range.  My greatest fear is we have a baby boy with F VIIII and he bumps his head and bleeds and dies. Can you all enlighten me a bit more. So back in the day, concerns about dying from simpler injuries would be more legitimate. Both factor FVIII (hemophilia A) and factor IX (hemophilia B) have tried and true medications to sustain \"normal\" clotting levels, and they are all covered by insurance.\n\nFrom the genetics side, you are correct. Its 50/50 since hemophilia is sex-linked on the x chromosome. Your son will have your Y chromosome and one of your wife's X chromosomes. In a similar thought, your daughter has the potential for being a carrier like your wife. Regardless, there are major medical breakthroughs like gene therapy coming through that essentially makes your body no longer have to worry about hemophilia. Others on this subreddit can talk to you more about that, but hemophilia really should not be of a concern for you or your wife if you have health insurance or live in an area that supports you (the UK, Japan, etc) Thanks. Unfortunately I live in the US and our health care system is atrocious. I just have fear that if we do have a boy naturally and he bumps his head while sleeping he would die in the crib. Am I over thinking this? I live in the US as well. Thankfully, most states recognize that kids with illnesses need help and expanded Medicaid. There are programs like CHIP (children's health insurance program) will provide your child with full medical care up until they are 18. From then, thanks to the affordable care act, they are covered by your insurance until theyre 26. That is a huge amount of time to prepare for any changes. You arent alone.\n\nNaturally you are going to be more stressed and not know what to do when bleeds happen, but there are protocols in place when you get hooked up with your local hemostasis treatment center where they are there for any emergency What is the day to day like for someone with factor IX. We are both super active parents and I just do not want my son to have to be a bubble boy and take medicine/pills his entire life. It depends on the severity and if they have inhibitors or not, but in the end it really boils down to a case to case basis. For me, I work out 3 to 4 times a week (weightlifting, biking, etc) and hike whenever I want. I infuse myself intravenously (a shot) 3 to 4 times a week, every other day, and I am normal. I cannot, and other hemophiliacs, do any contact sports like football or hockey, but I know some who have. It depends. The risk of injury was too high for me so I ran track and played baseball instead I treat kids with hemophilia.  We have an absolute ban on contact sports.  I recommend that parents look at the \u201cSteps for Living\u201d information section on   On this site is reference called Playing It Safe.  It has a great reference where sports are listed according to their risk to a boy with hemophilia.  Green is safe, yellow is conditional, and red is dangerous.\n\nI tell my new dads to read the list and try out all the green sports.  Find the ones you like and he will follow you in this. Thank you very insightful. My greatest concern is we have a baby boy who is hemophilia and bumps his head on the playground or something when he is super young. Like in his crib when sleeping and dies. Thank you. Insightful. We have two sons with severe hemophilia A, one is almost 3, the other 4 months (and 2 daughters who they could not confirm whether they were carriers or not after tests due to rarity of the particular strain I guess).\n\nMy wife's father of course also has severe hemophilia A but he has had an inhibitor his whole life which has been very debilitating as he could never take factor consistently until recently, he is now using something called Hemlibra which you can search information about right on this subreddit I am sure.\n\nEverything is better about living with hemophilia nowadays, but it is still certainly an additional worry, stress factor, expense, etc.\n\nThey have even gotten better at overcoming inhibitors now, at a conference a Hematologist was saying he is had an over 80% success for a while.\n\nAlso, I think it is now becoming common to offer Hemlibra to infants as even our conservative Hemo center has brought it up as a topic with our 4 month old (never brought it up with our 3 year old).\n\nWithout going into detail about Hemlibra, it can last for multiple weeks, you do not need to administer through a vein, and even works for those with inhibitors as previously stated.\n\nSuffice it to say, things are not so grim as you are fearing, it becomes more normal. \n\nWe give our 3 year old factor every other morning through his port (this was a surgery almost 2 years ago). I play with him like any other kid essentially once he  started getting regular factor. We go to nature school, parks, etc.\n\nIt is an adjustment, essentially training yourself to reliably and correctly administer factor intravenously, but once you get comfortable with this you will feel way more confident should any emergency pop up. Our Hemophilia Center helped us a ton in getting to this point. \n\nWith Hemlibra around now, I do not actually know if we are going to even get a port put in for our 4 month old, still debating it. So I suppose that would also be a debate for you guys to have with your Hemophilia Center. Thank you very insightful. What is a Port? Here you go: \n\n\nThis is good but can fill in if you have any other specific question on it. Thank you. And they have that in their chest the rest of their lives? My son is a severe FIX kid and we had similar fears. Truth is that could happen with any kid that falls and hit there head. With prophylactic treatments these are almost a never thing. My son actually did fall and hit head, split his scalp back when we were using benefix as our product. Was a mess and needed stitches but we all survived the ordeal. Now he is on a long acting factor and we infuse once a week rather than the every 2nd day that we were doing with benefix Thanks insightful. Just debating really if we try IVF again which is a severely financial heavy endeavor or try naturally and flip the coin 50-50 on having a boy who is a carrier of factor nine. We were lucky enough to have one boy but we recently had two miscarriages. Our baby boy will not have to deal with any of these medical situations and I would hate to have a brother of his who has factor nine have a life long battle with the illness always dealing with shots and infusions No they outgrow it after several years, they will have it removed surgically, around 5 or so is the plan for our son, he had it placed at 9 months.\n\nAt that point I guess it becomes a discussion on whether to place a new one or go without it, might not need it anymore if Hemlibra truly becomes the norm, we are kind of hitting new territory here with some advances as people have mentioned already. Ah ok I understand now. Thank you. Yup, no problem. I guess I should also underline, this is not ***that*** bad to handle at this point, it is doable, and yet our sons have ***severe*** A, they have no factor 8.\n\nWe have met parents with kids that have mild hemo B, and they do not have to do all this daily stuff, they are essentially living normally and is sorta kind of relatable to a severe allergy. They had one nose bleed turn into a hospital visit + drama because they did not know anything about hemophilia at that point yet.\n\nIt is on a spectrum but I guess the takeaway from our situation for you is that even in the worst case scenario it is definitely doable now, there is a lot of assistance and information. It is more of a severe ***inconvenience***, i.e. not that bad just kind of an annoying thing that becomes somewhat normal, now day-to-day. Definitely do not want to downplay anything, but I grew up with a friend born with diabetes and I would say her day-to-day was similarly inconvenienced, not too far off as a comparison. \n\nI think once you learn what hemophiliacs had to deal with in our parents' lifetime, you come to appreciate what it looks like today a lot more as well. Yes absolutely. We have friends with a diabetic son. I would say he is admitted just as often, if not more than our boy. &gt;Our baby boy will not have to deal with any of these medical situations and I would hate to have a brother of his who has factor nine have a life long battle with the illness always dealing with shots and infusions\n\nThis is a great point.  My brothers did not have it but I did.  I think it really fucked up our relationships.  I think family dynamics are probably hard enough without adding a chronic disease into the mix. Keep in mind if you have a daughter carrier she could be a hemophiliac too. So, I would say, these two examples are F8 (hemo A).\n\nHowever, there exists...\n\n\n\nAnd\n\n\n\nThere are really no limits* today to activity. \n\nTo say, much of the older community may be \u201climited\u201d due to joint damage from repeated bleeding. So, as long as the person has been taken care of with modern treatments and regimens and has no other complications, they are only limited by themselves. FWIW I have hemophilia B at 5% which is considered mild and I have only ever had one incident, at age 39, where some stitches on my shoulder from a cyst I would had removed became infected and broke in the shower and blood started literally squirting into the air.  I took a taxi to the ER and and by the time I got there my undershirt and the towel I had over the wound were pretty well soaked.  They just redid the stitches without giving me any factor or coagulant.  I am not really convinced it would have been any different for a non-hemophiliac. \n\nOther than that, normal childhood with no incidents or limitations. They opted not to remove my tonsils because of it, but that was in 1987.  Now I live in Europe and got a colonoscopy a while back. The doctor suggested I speak to a hematologist first to see if he had any concerns and he just said they should give me amchafibrin (a coagulation medicine) beforehand just to be safe. \n\nHonestly the biggest life long problem is with American health insurance and life insurance companies trying to fuck you because they see the word hemophilia and assume you are the Russian royal family bleeding out right there over the phone. Did you play sports as a child at all. Any issues? In addition, it pushes the same difficult reproductive decisions into the next generation. \n\nNothing beyond normal PE class in the school. Not because it was prohibited, in fact people were often encouraging me to be more active. Just because it was not my thing. Did the doctors say what severity of hemophilia B was indicated by the mutation they discovered? Not that I am aware of. Just that my wife is a carrier. We did IVF to extract that gene from the embryo we currently have. Unfortunately we had two miscarriages of the boys ( This graphic makes it seem very cut and dried.  But it is not always the case.  Some patients with low factor levels may experience fewer bleeds than predicted by their severity, while others with high levels may experience more bleeds than predicted.  It is one aspect of hemophilia that is not well understood.\n\nAsking about severity may help to inform your future decisions.  I guess you are not aware of anyone in your wife's family that has hemophilia?\n\nHere is a different blunt question: is having just one child an option? He is not likely to do that.  We worry more about collisions with other kids.\n\nWhen it comes to head bleeds, remember the golden rules.\n1. The time between an injury and factor is a risk factor.\n2. Medical alert IDs are life savers.\n\nGo over this with your HTC.  Be active in your local chapter and be the parent with lots of questions.  I much prefer to spend an hour with your list than have three \u201cI forgot to ask\u201dphone calls. Thanks. We just do not of the risk of trying naturally is worth the 50/50 coin toss. We were very fortunate to have a healthy boy with out factor 9 our first round of IVF. but with two miscarriages and the financial burden of doing another retrieval ~$25k I just feel beaten down. Shit. Severe is that high in HB. Again it is just a coin toss. Not sure I am willing to risk that. The long term medical costs would be more than going thru IVF again for a retrieval and eliminate the factor 9 completely. It is costly but seems worth it at this point. It is just so financial and emotional draining. Everyone has to do what is right for them.  Factor 9 deficiency is less of a burden now with long half life factor and gene therapy in process.  Talk with your local Hemophilia Chapter or treatment center. Has anyone suggested that you contact a Hemophilia Treatment Center in your area for (", "Have undergone any kind of surgery? If yes, how did you recover? How was your experience with it in general? I have limited mobility in both my knees with the right one bending just 80-90 degrees. The doctor has given me two choices. Either manipulation under anaesthesia or arthroscopy. So I just wanted to know your stories. My haematologist is reluctant of a possible arthroscopy. I am more on the arthroscopy side because it will apparently give me much more range of mobility.\n\nCorrection: Have you* I got run over by a logging truck when I was 18. Shattered my right femur, right hand punched through the windshield and had to have my face fixed too. I was on a factor drip for a week and than treated daily for six months during recovery. It was terrible and I died like three times but it oh well. Feel free to pm if you want to talk about it.  I have had a couple of GA surgeries (I think 4 or 5) including a multiple hour emergency and never had any real problems from them. Recovery just involved factor 8 into an IV line before (maybe during?) And after the surgery. I think the only difference in my recovery from a non-haemophiliac person is that I stayed in the ward a day or two longer. Wow. Awesome. Staying a day or two longer is expected but 'no real problems' that is awesome  I have had several surgeries over the years; total right knee replacement  (went spectacularly well, was starting to walk on it within 3 days), right thigh fasciotomy, right upper fore arm fasciotomy, chest tube, and of course all 4 wisdom teeth surgically removed.\n\nOf all of that only the wisdom teeth were problems, was in the hospital for about 10 days total and getting the bleeding to stop was difficult.\n\nWith modern factor replacement therapies as long as you have the surgery done in a hospital that has experience with bleeding disorders or better yet has an HTC in it you most surgery should be just fine. ALWAYS include your hematologist/HTC in any plans you have to undergo any surgical procedure too. I do not get why your hematologist would be against arthroscopy. Sure it is an incision but it is not like they are slicing it open.\n\nI have had synovectomies in both ankles ('05, '13) and an ulnar nerve translocation (in January). As long as you stick to your infusion schedule, *rest*, and do not overdo the painkillers, it will all be fine. I had a bone spur removed from my right leg, it was a short one hour procedure that was not too invasive. It would have been an in-and-out procedure, but they kept me overnight to monitor for bleeding and whatnot. Pretty uneventful. This was nearly 8 years ago now, and I have had no complications. \n\nAs far as my personal exprience: I just had lots of bruising, but it really was not a big deal. I am a very mild haemophiliac, and my right knee is damaged but highly serviceable in general living. I have pretty much full movement.\n\nBut increasingly up until 2008 I was getting repeated joint bleeds - like every few weeks. My orthopod was reluctant to operate but I bulldozed him into it. There were complications, admittedly - I was in hospital for about a week rather than the originally planned couple of days - but since then I have not had a bleed in that knee.", "Any EDC factor tips from experience? We have a 7 week old with severe favor IX deficiency. No prophylaxis yet, but we have medication on hand if needed.\nQuestion: do we actually need to carry with us everywhere we go?  Any tips and specific product recommendations for keeping cool while traveling around? Mostly traveling in vehicle 30 minutes to an hour from home for long days. Hoping there are better and more reliable options than just a cooler and ice packs. Welcome to the community!\n\nThings will get much easier once your little one's on prophylactic treatment- most of the newer generation rarely get bleeds. Until then, it is important to be mindful of your location in relation to a supply of factor, and the proximity to a pediatric hematologist.\n\nDo you need to carry the factor everywhere? No. That would be pointless unless you are able to administer the factor yourself, or if you are close to a hospital able to administer the factor. 30 minutes from home is just fine.\n\nMost modern factor is non-human plasma derived now, and has a shelf life of around 6 months at room temperature. No fridge required. Depending on what factor replacement they put your little one on, you can just put it in an insulated bag and it should be fine. Just do not leave it in the hot car. I do not (and would not) carry factor everywhere.  As long as you are able to get home within a reasonable amount of time, leave it there.  And now you will wonder what a \"reasonable amount of time\" is and I will say \"ASAP\" but within an hour or two is much faster than an ER visit.  I went to the ER many times, was taken back right away, seen by the doctor who requested Factor VIII right away, only to sit for 2-3 hours waiting for the factor because the pharmacy was waiting for it to reach room temperature based on the instructions.  I say all of that add perspective.  The quicker you treat, the better but it is not worth carrying it.  Leaving a dose or two at grandma's or a friend that you visit often is a good idea but for the most part it is safe to leave it at home.  I store mine at room temperature (check instructions) and keep a bag in the closet with several doses and supplies ready to go just in case I need it.  I live in a small town and the local hospital does not even have Factor VIII so the bag is ready for my wife to grab in the event of an emergency.  That is how I handle things, hopefully you will get some good ideas from us so you can create a system that works for you.  Good luck and welcome to the club. Thank you very much As others have said probably no need to tote it around with you everywhere. if you do decide to carry it with you because life happens and you never know how accessible it is going to be if you leave it at home the important thing is do not leave it in the hot car. Put it in a purse or in bag in the diaper bag or something that you will not leave in the hot car. Also rotate the dose so that you are not carrying around an ancient dose. If he needs an infusion use it and replace it that way it is always fresh.", "Patient Support Program - Discussion  My name is Maggie and I am with LaGrippe Research.

Really happy there is a community here. I was diagnosed with a mild type A hemophilia about 20 months ago. Never really thought anything of it until I had my wisdom teeth pulled in a normal out patient procedure. Everything went swimmingly until about 9 days out when I suddenly started bleeding profusely and ended up landing in the hospital for 3 days. It is actually made me want to become a coagulation specialist! \n\nI have a few questions though, such as 1) What age were you diagnosed with hemophilia, 2) How severe is it and how do you cope with it on a daily basis, and 3) Who do you see?

I am a 29 year old male with severe Haemophilia B.\n\nI have been on prophylaxis treatment with Benefix since I was a child, treating myself twice a week. Thankfully no inhibitors, but I have arthritis in both my ankles, especially the right one. They cause me the most problems more than bleeding.\n\nOver the last 5-7 years, due to a sedentary lifestyle, I have cut back on how often I am treating myself to once a month (on average). I can only recall 1 bleed in that entire time, but there may be a couple more.\n\nBecause I am hardly taking treatment and have bleeds so rarely, I feel like my treatment is not that necessary like it was when I was growing up. It feels bad to ignore the constant \u201cYou should take your treatment\u201d comments I get from everyone who knows about it, but it is expensive for the country (I live in the EU) and I on some level I resent needing it.\n\nHow often are you taking your treatment?\nDo you feel like you need is as infrequently as me? What, can you get arthritis even though you are in prophylaxis? Oh god I did not know this, I am just a 15 yo and I thought I could live without fearing arthritis thanks to prophylaxis.\nWhat should I do to improve my chances of keeping my joints healthy? \nI already do a lot of excercise and such, but is there something else I can do? I have in my case, but I have also had points in prophylaxis where I have not stuck to it as rigorously as I could have. Whether that caused arthritis or whether it was going to happens anyway is difficult to say.\n\nWhen I saw younger I regularly had bleeds in my ankles. That is most likely what is up the deterioration of them. If I understand your post correctly, you are not treating as often as you should because you are worried about the expense for your country?  I guess it is admirable that you are trying to control costs, but you are potentially harming yourself in the long run.  If your country has socialized medicine you should count your blessings and utilize it to improve your health situation.\n\nLook into extended half-life products like Alprolix or Idelvion which may allow you to treat as infrequently as every 10 or 14 days. People that do not have Hemophilia get arthritis too. It is just as hemophiliacs we are more susceptible to getting it due to joint damage caused by bleeds One severe bleed can cause permeant arthritis if I am not mistaken. A single one? Jesus christ that is fucked up, I hope I get to see a even better treatment than gene therapy treatment within my life-span. Protect yourself at all costs bro, Gene therapy is here they offered it to me at my last clinic appointment which pretty much cures hemophilia if I am not mistaken. Now replacing the cartilage in my ankles is another story and the is the crux of my issues. I am so glad I have not fused my ankles, another hemo posted a link to synthetic cartilage awhile back so there is hope for us.. technology is ramping up fast. Gene therapy will hopefully offer hope for our brothers who suffer without medicine. Keep in mind these drug companies do not give a shit about anyone aside from making a profit, I will never respect them or hold them in any esteem after the Bayer incident. There is no way this shit should be 2000 bucks a box especially when it is synthetic. As we get older we tend to be less physically active so we have fewer bleeds from activity.  Our metabolism slows down so we do not use up our medication as fast as we did as kids so we can go longer between treatments, especially if we only treat the worst of them and just deal with the minor inconvenience bleeds, pain, and swelling.  You are probably allowing damage to compile by not treating regularly.  Believe me, I would love for prophylaxis treatment to have been more common 40 years ago.  I know I would be in better condition today.  I even understand the idea of doing the noble thing and not costing money if you really do not have to, and I thought that way briefly.  But when you look at how much money governments spend, you and 1000 other hemophiliacs could stop using factor and it would not move the needle.  Appreciate that it is available and use it because choosing not to will only hurt you in the long run.  Which will cost money eventually so take advantage of what is available.  Suffering does not benefit anybody. I am a 30 YO moderate B and I take Alprolix every 10 days. It is great. \n\nWas on Benefix every 3 days I until I was 25 and thankfully made this switch. You must have been offered a spot in a gene therapy clinical trial.  No hemophilia gene therapy products have yet been approved by regulators. Yes you are correct it was a trail. AlprolIX is the bees knees! I am a 33 year old severe vWD 3. I should be infusing 2-3x a week but lately I have been doing it 1x every 2 weeks. It is NOT good and not healthy. I notice way more bruising, bleeding and joint pain.\n\nWhile you may not notice any major bleeding episodes, there may be \"micro bleeds\" happening in your joints. This has been a recent discovery that while we may not feel too bad, our joints may be bleeding tiny amounts from everyday use.\n\nFor example, sometimes when I wake up, my ankles are stiff and sore due to arthritis. If I keep using my ankles throughout the day, it could potentially go from a micro bleed into a full bleed if I do not infuse.\n\nWhen I was in my early 20's I did not infuse for 8 WHOLE MONTHS. My excuses were school work and my 2 part time jobs. Now I suffer with a pretty damaged elbow.\n\nMy factor is expensive for my country, but I need it. Please, if you can, INFUSE NOW. Save yourself the pain I have now. It sucks and it causes so many other issues. You have to be carful with not treating like that. You may think your getting by, but later in life you may find damage from tiny bleeds that went unnoticed when you were younger. This was the advice given to me when I was treating sparsely.", "Who knows about your condition? My chick gives me a hard time because I do not like her to mention my hemophilia to people.  Other than family I do not like to mention it, not because it is embarrassing but because it is more a weakness I do not want exploited.

My son is 10 months old and so far, we have not required any extra padding for him but he is on a prophylaxis regimen.  With that being said I know plenty of parents who swore by knee pads, elbow pads and double-diapering.  My suggestion would be to also include pants that provided and extra layer of protection in the bottom area since bleeding can occur as they are learning to stand/walk and they fall in repetition on that area.  The superhero idea is cool but I also just like plain colors for pants so that I can mix and match with his tops.  I found a pair of cute pants at H&amp;M that were a camel color and they actually had an extra patch on the knees for some padding.  They are my favorite pants for him because the color matches with a lot.  If I were a mom and spending extra money on clothing that offered padding, I would want something very versatile.  \n\nAlso, if the padding could be installed on the inside, that would be cool--kind of like a bra for lack of a better comparison.

The clinic has been in touch with my insurance company and told me that I should be receiving the Factor VIII from Maxor).  I called Maxor but have not heard back. \n\nAnyway, I had an OBGYN appointment this week and I was told I am 1 CM dilated, but it is unclear when I will go into labor.  Apparently the hospital has Factor VIII handy for the delivery, but I was told that I need to use Factor VIII clotting factor post-delivery for infusion for a few days....which was supposed to be mail to me.\n\nAnyone in a similar situation? What now? I am having trouble getting Maxor to call me back.  I am concerned because I could go into labor at any time..... I am so sorry, have you tried contacting your local hemophilia chapter? I would just keep being the squeaky  wheel. Call and email until you get confirmation of shipment. Also reach out to your hematologist to see if they can reach out to the insurance. \nIt is in their best interest to send you the factor because if they do not, you will have to get it directly from the hospital inventory which is more expensive for them. I have had plenty of factor delays and droughts in my life, but never when I was on the clock like you are.  First, I cannot imagine you being sent home without factor so I would not worry too much about being left without BUT it is time to make sure everyone involved knows the situation.  Make sure the hematologist, nurses, doctors, insurance company, Maxor, etc... know you have not received your home doses and labor is imminent.  Somebody should be able to pull some strings and rush things along.  The insurance company and Maxor are obviously the ones to start with but do not be polite, make sure they know time is running out.  If it is not resolved before you go to the hospital, make sure everyone involved in the birth/recovery knows your situation.  The hematologist can probably use the right language to get things rushed through Maxor but I have had nurses that knew how to handle situations for me or had a contact that was able to help me through tough spots.

I have always been told I couldnt with Hemophilia but I wanted to be sure, not interested in getting one now but I am later down the line. \n\n2nd, should I smoke weed? I have alot of friends that do and I would like to join them however I thought it would affect me poorly. Primarily I want to start working out and losing weight with a friend of mine but little activities cause bleeds or at least pain, wanting to know if weed (recreational or medical) would help ease pain.\n\n3rd, would I be able to get the Covid vaccine? I have never once gotten a vaccine in my muscle, only fat tissue, and I am wondering if I could get the Covid Vaccine the same way, if not is it safe bleeding wise? I quarantine and social distance myself properly but just wondering. \n\n4th, could I see a chiropractor? This is honestly just me being scared but I have severe back and shoulder pain and want to know if it is safe. \n\nSorry if I sound too worried but I have done basically nothing in my life due to Hemophilia lol. I have done all of those 4 things and no problem at all, of course it depends from person to person but in my case, no problem at all, however in case of doubt you better check it first with your doctor. 1. I have moderate hemophilia A, my hematologist has personally recommended that I infuse before and after a tattoo but that I should call in before planning it to set up a care plan depending on the size of the tattoo and such (I have not gotten a tat yet but I have asked for future reference).\n\n2. Smoking weed wont affect your condition. However, I will warn that you should be careful with how much you smoke because you could get injured while high and not even know. I personally cut my thumb deeply once on a glass I did not know was broken and did not feel it due to the high. Thankfully it stopped bleeding with some pressure.\n\n3. I have seen lots of people say on reddit that the vaccine has not affected them with their bleeding. I received the shot today and no bleeding happened. Just soreness. The needle is really thin. \n\n4. I have been seen by a chiro and been adjusted plenty of times without issue. Usually they do not apply too much pressure and are careful with their adjustments. But like I said I am Hemophilia moderate, so I do not know 100% if there would be much difference in Severe A. It is always smart to check with your own hematologist and also let the chiropractor know of your condition and to be extra careful. \n\nHope this helped :) Thank you this did help! Yes to everything except the chiropractor. I mean, they do more then crack you, but do not get cracked. And tell them you have hemophilia and they probably will not do much to you either for fear of being sued or something. You can do pretty much anything g if you infuse regularly. Do not let hemophilia limit you. You can do anything you put your mind to. Some things like mma fighting might not be the best idea! But you know, witching reason. I know a guy with hemophilia who has climbed Everest. Another who is been an Alaskan bush pilot since he was 16, and he is 75 now and has not missed a summer of flying. I ride dirt bikes , rode my Bmw on 12\u2019 half pipes as a kid, and I travel the world and play in punk rock bands and I am 46 now. The more you do the more you will be able to do. So do it all, and take care of your body. Eat right and exercise, all that, do not do stupid drugs, the regular healthy living stuff, and infuse as much as you are able to and you will be fine. Medical care should be a priority if you want to make hemophilia as little of an obstacle as is possible. Oh yea I am severe A, and in better shape now than when I was a kid. Anything else? Yes, yes, definitely yes, not really sure. 1. I am severe A with an inhibitor (in remission) and have multiple tattoos. Pre-dosed with 100% correction prior to going, did not tell artist.\n\n2. Smoked weed for years, helps dull the pain for me.\n\n3. I would not recommend anyone get the jab. Just my personal position on it.\n\n4. Went to a chiropractor for a couple years and never had issues, though that is me... if you go and have pain or bleeding issues stop. \n\n\n\nAlways talk to your doctor, but remember to think for yourself. You get to choose what to do with your body, and the consequences of those choices are also your responsibility.  1 - I would not get one.  Too much risk of it looking absolutely horrible.\n\n2 - I hope you are over 25!   MJ will stop your brain from developing until that age.   To quote south park...  \"Stan, it is not that weed is bad, but it makes you ok with being bored.  And when you are bored is when you are supposed to learn to play an instrument, or get involved with a new hobby.   If you keep smoking, you might find yourself waking up at 30 and not know how to do anything.\"\n\n3 - Yes.  I have gotten the vaccine.  Just give a dose of factor before.  That is all that is needed for me, at least.   No ill effects at all.  The wife was a little tired.   We have been shot full of so many things all our lives...   do we know any of us who have gotten covid?   I would not take a risk to not get it.  Seems stupid to me. \n\n4 - NO.

I once knew someone whose brother was a police officer. For the military it is an automatic no. There is no way for them to guarantee you receive meds if you were to ever be deployed which means you would put yourself in danger as well as your fellow soldiers.

Just wondering if anyone else experiences cyclical bleeds.  In my experience I can go months without any serious issues, but typically once or twice a year I will have a month or two where I have bleed after bleed.  On examination I do not see major lifestyle changes during the months with bleeds and those without.\n\nOne aspect that seems to relive bleeding series is strength training.  For the last few years I have been doing bodyweight and barbell strength training routines and the months that I have very dedicated and lifting 3-4 times per week I see a massive decrease in bleeding events.  An impact to my knees or shin when not engaging in strength  training is a guaranteed bleed.  But a similar impact when I am in a heavy training cycle might not even bruise.  I assume it has something to do with inflammation and forcing inflammation in controlled exercise.  Anybody have thought on this or experience anything similar? The month of March has always been a problem for me. Kept active all winter either snow skiing or snowmobiling but it did not matter. March was a month for bleeds. I have been doing cardio for over a decade now and strength training for about four years. I have not had a joint bleed in forever, but I did have an iliopsoas bleed last year when I went from treadmill and weight machines to HIIT yoga and bodyweight exercises. Since then I stick to a recumbent bike, which is boring but safe, and using free weights under the guidance of my physical therapist. No issues since and I have been able to get a lot of range of motion and mass back in an arthritic shoulder.", "Please help My partners doctors are fucking worthless, and are doing nothing about extreme pain after a hyaluronic shot in his ankle. If anyone has any advice whatsoever, we will take any leads. They are not listening. I am sorry they are going through this.   I have a problem elbow that I used to take pain killers for, but my doctor also stopped prescribing them, with nothing to carry me through in their absence.  I do not know how they can do that and it seems pretty insensitive to do to a hemophiliac in such pain, but they do it anyway.  \n\nI have found that large amounts of marijuana seems to help, but that just seems to make me not care so much about the pain, though it is still there.  If you want to give it a shot, there is something that I have used to manage really bad bleeds.  It' might be all in my head, but sometimes my partner will gently glide her fingertips over whatever is hurting, and that will put me straight to sleep.  It does not relieve the pain for long, but when I have been in pain for hours on end, it is enough relief to let me get to sleep.  I do not know why it works, but it seems to draw the focus away from the pain and focus on the tingling across the skin instead.  It is something my mother used to do when I was a child and had a bleed, and it has worked for me for almost 50 years.  Might be worth a shot.  \n\nI hope they start feeling better and that things get easier for them, and for you.  I know it can be an emotional hurricane to be with a hemophiliac and this we have to deal with, but people like you are  angels to us. Consult another doctor but could be a cortisone flare.  That is so frustrating, I hate this knee jerk reaction to the opiate epidemic. What state are you in? In CA Kratom is legal to buy, it is similar to an opiate and was very effective in relieving severe headaches for me. Please be careful though, as it is super addictive. While I disagree with doctors bowing to politics, I do happen to be in recovery from opiate addiction lol. And I got very hooked on Kratom. But if your husband has never had an issue with opiates then it might be helpful. Good luck! ( My boyfriend is a mechanic with hemophilia (less than 1% clotting factor) and his doctors are at OHSU. They have an entire dept dedicated to hemophilia. I would suggest looking into OHSU Oregon. \n\nI am not sure where you all are located, but they are very compassionate and answer all my questions and concerns when I have concerns for my bf. \n\nI truly hope you can find something that works.

Jesus when i was being lazy for years and doing on demand I would get more than once a month easy. Being on demand wrecked my ankles, elbow, and knee. \n\nSince switching to prophy 10 years ago, no new target joints. Started Helimbra a month ago, interested in seeing how this goes. The shots are certainly much much better Only more than once a month? I was having weekly bleeds on on demand. I had done prophylaxis twice. The first was ineffective as the dose was too low for me. The second started out ineffective as the dose was too low for me. They had to raise it twice in order for the spontaneous bleeds to stop. That means the formula for calculating the dose is just a guideline which may not work for everyone. Anyway, once the spontaneous bleeding stopped, I started exercising and the strengthened muscles have helped my joints a lot. I also stopped driving and started walking everywhere and taking public transport instead. Did not they run factor level checks before after, and then next couple days? I am lucky enough to go to one of the best HTC's in the world, so I often have a very skewed view of what many people with hemophilia go through.\n\nThat is awesome about eventually getting it under control though and how well you are doing. Helimbra so far for me week 6 has been amazing. I tiny shot in the stomach every 2 weeks, and no bleeds what so ever. I am feeling better than I have in years. Plus, I still have normal factor, just in case I get a breakthrough. Looking forward to seeing just how much I can push myself now.\n\nThey said it is basically like going from severe to moderate There were some months I would. Usually at 3 small bleeds a month. \n\nHell I get them in my knuckles from cracking them. If I sleep wrong I can get a hip bleed. They did do the factor level tests. But the bleeds continued. It takes one kind of doctor to look at the factor level tests and say everything is fine; and another kind of doctor who sees the real world data of bleeds continuing and put his foot down to increase the dose. Ahhh, that really sucks they continued.. When I went on prophy for the first time, my HTC was all over things, kind of to the point of annoyance, even now with my new treatment. They have been sending nurses to my house even to double check everything weekly.", "Go bags So here is a question guys/gals. I have seen posts about backpacks and such that you transport your meds in. So my question is this: \n\nif you are regularly carrying factor with you do you treat on demand? \n\nAnd the second question is are there any prophy users that routinely carry factor with them? \n\nAnd now that I think about it one other question do you carry anything additional in your go bag?\n\nI only ask because I have the occasion where I need to take my dose to go today. Looking into my backpack it is awful empty with one dose. I keep a \"get home bag\" in my car minus an extra dose. I prophy regularly (which I only began recently) so I dont cart around an extra dose. My concern is issues with hot and cold temperatures. \n\nHavent considered an EDC bag \ud83e\udd14 That is more what I was curious about because I have seen the posts about go bags but never understood the point of carting meds around as a prophy user. Obviously an extended trip away from home is a different story. I treat on demand and used to keep a box. It was made for fishing supplies but fit everything including factor for a full dose . Would peal the pharmacy sticker off the bag the factor came in and put it on the box. I then added into my emergency info to not leave with me from accident or such without the box.  I have since changed to leaving it at work and my supervisor knows to grab it if need be. I have two packs.  One is a \"small\" pouch that has a double dose with supplies to administer.  The second is a medium sized duffel bag with 8-10 doses and supplies.  Occasionally I will grab the small pouch if I have to go away for a day or two.  It is easier than packing with my clothes and potentially forgetting something.  The large bag has a velcro patch labeling it as \"Factor VIII\" so my wife or possibly other family member can grab it on the way to the hospital if I have been in an accident.  Thankfully I have never needed the large bag in an emergency but I decided to put it together a few years back when I went to my local, rural hospital for a kidney stone.  I would never had one and thought it might be something seriously wrong with me. While there, my hemophilia came up and I learned the hospital's pharmacy does not even stock any type of Factor VIII at all.  I just make sure I rotate my stock every 6 months.  I store both packs in a closet so they are not refrigerated but you might be a bit more careful with product than me.  I will also grab the big bag on the rare occasion I have to go out of town for work or family emergencies.  It is just easier not having to pack meds and supplies when you are trying to not forget your toothbrush. I made a small to go pouch that had infusion supplies that fit into a small cooler bag that I would add factor to. I still bring it with whenever I take my son out for any trip that is takes us out of range of his clinic. Granted he is on Hemlibra now so it is more like a just incase shit goes south bag. I recently discovered that some companies such as xyntha have travel cases/bags for free. Checkout your factor company's website to see if they have it. I have listed the one I have from Xyntha below for you to check it out and it makes my life so much easier when traveling. \n\n\n\n(scroll down some and you will see the travel case) I think if you kept a sling pack or maybe a phanny pack on your person at all times, it would not be a big deal. Having an extra dose on you just in case is not such a bad idea now that I think about it.

I understand it is a rare genetic disorder,  but we have no known family history of this.  I am just curious if anyone else has personal experience in this bleeding disorder.\n\n*Her factor level is 29% and she has been asymptomatic thus far.  Probably a carrier if she is asymptomatic?  First, not sure where you live, but have you been put in contact with a hemophilia treatment center?  If you have access to one they are the best option for the best outcomes in the management and support of the condition. They offer truly specialized care to all members of the bleeding community. To put it in another perspective and some of this is simplifying, for most primary care providers hemophilia is an old out dated footnote in one of the books they read in med school, a average hematologist may have read a chapter on hemophilia in med school because many times hematologists are also oncologist(cancer), but the doctors at the HTC are the authors of the most current books on the matter. \n\nSo I have severe A, but it runs in the family and we have low level(mild A) women in my family. So while it is not FVII it is related. There are many others in here that will have more direct experience with FVII in females. \n\n\n Yes. She is asymptomatic. She complains of joint pain but never swells or bruises abnormally.  Thanks. We have been seeing the only pediatric hematologist in South Texas. I think your absolutely right that A Hemophilia Foundation would be more resourceful to us.   I would say pediatric hematologist does not always mean hemophilia treatment center, if they are an HTC they tend to be very clear about we are a HTC. HTC are one stop shops with a team of doctors that usually consists of a hematologist, Physical therapist, orthopaedic specialist, nurse practitioners and a social worker and they are all on the same page to provide the most comprehensive care to people with bleeding disorders. Most of the hemophilia treatment centers tend be attached to pediatrics because the mortality rates even 50 years ago were so low many of us did not make it in to adult hood. I was just saying it is something to consider if you have access to or are finding your current hematologist that may non specialized in bleeding disorders is not providing the best care. \n\nMost of the hemophilia foundations are more inclusive of the other bleeding disorders like FVII, FIX, VWF(von willi), and more, it is not A\u2019s only.  Get onto either the CDC or the NHF's website.  Both have a HTC database that you can search by closest one to your town.  I would suggest seeing a coagulationist (at the Hemophilia Treatment Center).  They can confirm or refute the diagnosis and if confirmed, get her onto a management plan.  Factor VIIa deficiency does occur and the family history is frequently not helpful as it is autosomal recessive so you can have a lot of unaffected generations.  Most people are mildly abnormal.  It is rare to see one lower than 10% (does happen, but most are in the 20-40% range).  It is treated with NovoSeven RT which is an insanely expensive drug.  Call your insurance company and ask for a case manager and coverage to see an HTC to confirm this diagnosis.  If she has it, and needs surgery, she will need really good insurance and you want to make sure that your coverage is set up before hand.

AMA Hello all - I am posting this AMA for anyone who might be curious about my experience going from being pretty inactive, to getting in running shape, while managing my severe hemophilia.\n\nI made the decision to start running at the end of last summer, as a way to lose some weight and just get healthier. I started walking in the park, and running in short stretches, until the day I could run 3 miles without stopping. Now I have run 10 miles a few times, and I am sure I will be ready to finish the half on March 17. I plan to keep training continuously, with the ultimate goal of running the full NYC marathon in November 2020.\n\nYou might be able to guess some of the challenges I have faced so far:\n\n* Ankle and knee bleeds - nothing major, but these were definitely happening for the first 6 weeks or so of running. It took a while for my body to get used to the repetitive stress. Now that I have gained some strength and improved my form, I am not getting these bleeds.\n* Managing my prophylaxis - I have tried my best to stick to a regular schedule for my training runs, and align that schedule with taking my medicine. I have been taking Advate for many years and it mostly works great for preventing any breakthrough bleeding. It is just kind of a pain when a bleed does happen, or when I have to adjust my run schedule, and adjust prophylaxis accordingly. I have an appointment with my hematologist the week after the half marathon, and I am very interested in switching to Hemlibra, and curious about how it could make training easier.\n* Losing momentum - I am not naturally fitness-minded. When I break my routine, or miss a run or two, my motivation to pick the routine back up suffers. As I finish writing this, I am about to leave my apartment to go on my first run in about 3 weeks, since I have been having pain in my left hip for that amount of time. I am not sure it was ever a bleed, but I was staying off of it to be cautious, and not injure myself further before the half marathon.\n\nHere is a link to my crowdrise page - If anyone would like to make a donation of any amount, it would help me reach my fundraising goal, and help the NHF with all the good they do for our community!\n\n(\n\nI will look forward to getting to know some of you on this subreddit, and answering some questions!\n\nThanks,\n\nGeorge I can tell you from my experience with this sub that your going to be disappointed in the turnout for this AMA, still cool what your doing though. You should do it in the ama page. Not here Ok. I have some insights that may help you. But I do not like how long it takes to type everything out. So if you are interested in talking, message me. It is easier to talk over the phone.  True, the sub is not great. But then again the \u201chemophilia community\u201d is not famous for being accessible. Go figure. It is up to us to dig. To ask for help. And to reach out and to be open to feedback. If you have severe hemophilia (or you are one of those \u201cmoderates\u201d) and you have lived to be a young adult, that qualifies you to be an expert on the subject. \nWe all have our strong points and failures. But we also all have unique experiences that we have lived through. And no amount of schooling or research can compare to what we have lived through. Day by day, minute by minute. For fuck sake! \nSome of us have been lucky enough to live in populated areas with other hemophiliacs to commiserate with. And some of us have had family members with bleeding disorders to learn from. But some of us are alone in this. \nIt is important to understand that hemophilia, as much as it is a definable disability in all of the ways that it is understood, it is also a personal experience- not that long ago in the telling of this story, as little as 2 generations ago, the life expectancy of someone with hemophilia was around 13 yrs.  So , that sucks, and also- because of this, not a lot is known. Not a lot of history about how to treat hemophiliacs older than 13. And that would not have been a peaceful death.. Swelling until the pressure from your blood filled knee stopped on it is own? But in the last 30 (40?) yrs, with the introduction of clotting factor, there have been so many , constantly changing improvements ,as well as \u201clearning experiences\u201d. Hooray for us!!!\nBut with the many improvements, came an equal amount of individual experience, that if noted, has been filed away as quickly as the medications were able to be improved upon. So, my point in saying all of this, is that WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. More so than any hematologist can offer. More so than any organization can define. Is the strength of our own experience. And because of the rarity of hemophilia, and our low numbers, these experiences of ours are not common enough to make a dent in any medical statistics.  Because we are all individuals, more than we are a large number. \nI wish I could just talk to other hemo\u2019s. Because what I have to say and what I know from experience, and the experience of following my family and friends and taking away from their lessons are things I can only pass on to others personally by talking to them. So if you want to talk message me. We could learn more from each other if we talked. \nIt is a pain I know. Dealing with people is a pain. I will answer your messages regardless.  Damn dude, I guess I will respond when the movie adaptation comes out for this comment. No questions from me, but I did donate. Will be cheering on Team NHF. \ud83d\ude42 Cue violins Thank you so much! That is awesome man congrats! Can I ask, how we are your joints prior to beginning training?  I am Severe A as well, and had a similar journey a few years ago -- going from not being able to run 1 mile without breaks to doing 10+ half marathons. My right ankle is a target joint, and all of the training definitely helped it get stronger and have fewer bleeds as well.\n\nI will be curious if you decide to continue pursuing the full marathon after completing half. In my case, after finishing every half, I thought about what it would take for me to do the same thing over again, and truly had no desire to do so. I have heard from many (non-hemophiliac) people that the full distance is not worth the toll it takes on your body. But then again there are hundreds of thousands of people each year who decide it is!\n\nBest of luck on your race! Hey man, I did a half marathon in the UK back in 2015. Good luck with it, you will definitely feel the benefits of keeping regularly fit. Have the states not seen gene therapy come through yet? I know my brothers are both on it and have seen great results from it. My target joints are my elbows, so prior to beginning training I had not had too many ankle or knee bleeds. All in all, my joints are in great shape due to my being on prophylaxis basically my entire life.\n\nAs I write this, my left hip is hurting. It does not feel like a bleed. The only thing I can compare it to is the few times I have injured my shoulder bowling, which would leave it hurting for a couple weeks. The half marathon is one month from today so I am really hoping the pain goes away and does not affect my training. I am going to finish the race regardless, but I want to be in good shape so I can finish under 2 hours. I really want to get to a point where I am fit enough to run 10 miles 2-3 times per week. I am curious to see how difficult that ends up being, and what training for a full marathon really looks like for me. Last month I ran 50+ miles with no real issues, but the hip situation I am currently dealing with popped up out of nowhere.\n\nThanks! I am not sure if gene therapy is an option for us in the U.S. yet - I have not heard about any recent developments. If it was approved by the FDA, I feel like I would have heard about it, but that is great for your brothers! I will do some reading.\n\nThanks so much for your donation!

My dad jus told me i shoudlent be running but ive been running for like 3 years so idk what to think. He said i start to bleed if i run. Is this true? Can i run if i have helimbra cause im thinking of switching later next year. Also what possibilities does helimbra bring to hemophelics. Ty I used to run and now both of my ankles are destroyed. The joints have completely worn out. It is not worth it, trust me. I am taking painkillers every day. If i stop runing will i still get pain in my ankles in the future? I think this is a better question for a hematologist, especially if you are wondering about your capabilities with a different factor. \n\nI would say that if you do go for runs, be sure to stay up on your factor, stretch and ice after your workout. Doing these things is paramount. You could switch to riding a bicycle, too, because it is less impact on your joints. Longevity being the goal, you will get more from two wheels than from running Dam u right. Ty I just heard from some people that theyve had 0 bleeds with helimbra so i was curious Ye but be careful How do i be careful? U know your bodyso did what u think u can Helimbra is really good i was on it when it was in testing and it has been great only little bleeds We can run while young. As you age it may catch up with you. Biking may be better. So if i bike i wont get ankle injurys when im older? Also why does everything worsen when your older? Biking and swimming are lot less stressful on your joints so they will last longer. Age will catch up to everyone eventually. Ah ty Gumpy_ said it right. \"Longevity being the goal\" Whatever feels ok today may be absolutely excruciating in ten or twenty years. I wish I had understood this much earlier in my life. Now I am 35 and doing the math to balance funds enough to afford two shiny new ankle joints. I can barely walk. Unsupported my daily max is less than a mile. Total. I am already on the max dose.of Celebrex and the Hemo and I are both hoping to get the ankles done before I start having GI issues. My legs hurt constantly. Walking or No walking. Anything beyond walking is a none option. Literally, If survival required running for more than 100ft I would just be dead. Lol. Even just walking between a half mile and a mile results in serious to excruciating pain. Consider the long haul when choosing your hobbies. Aim for low impact, you will thank yourself later. \n\nI do want to mention this just in general... \n\nThey have been doing studies about asymptomatic joint bleeding in Hemophiliacs for years. Now with Hemlibra they are even more curious how often damage from joint bleeding you do not even know you are experiencing occurs.  It is not information they have in abundance, but there is data to support the idea that even when you do not feel like you are bleeding you just might be bleeding a little anyways. And that little amount of bleeding can still do damage long term. Apparently, from what studies and articles I have read, a not insignificant number of our population has joint damage that does not line up with the amount of symptomization and known bleeding that has been documented. Leading more and more hematologists to believe that asymptomatic bleeding is more common than previously believed. I do not know how old are you, but in my case, I started feeling severe pain in my twenties. I used to run when I was a teenager. \n\nAlso, many times I was not on a proper level on factor, because I refused to inject myself (stupid rebel me). Additionally, I played football/soccer with my friends from time to time. Godam. This alot to take in. Can i exercise such as weigtlifting? It sucks even more to cause i wrestle. Its my last year and i wana get it over and done with cause overtime ive learned more about hem and how wrestling isnt recomended. But still see people telling me here that with helimbra theyve been living pretty normal lives. Im kind of confused lol Dam, football. That Is a harsh sport. Hope your better It is all about choice and balance as best as I can tell. Stress is life. Our bodies respond to environmental stressors. Without gravity to stress them our bones weaken and deteriorate. Same thing with our vascular systems. Appropriate stress is essential to thrive. So you have to find a balance between exercise and excess stress. Weightlifting is ok, powerlifting probably not. Lol. Yoga is going to be even better. It accomplishes most of what weightlifting accomplished while still being very rigorous and yet still low strain. Running? Bad idea. Biking? Much lower impact aerobic exercise. Finding the middle ground seems to be where it is at. And that is not to say that you CANNOT do those things. It is just that for us the potential cost and risks to our bodies is much greater than for a normal person. Can you ride a motorcycle? Absolutely. But you are much more likely to die if something goes wrong than the regular person might. Can you skydive? Sure, but special care to protect your ankles and knees should be taken, and I would not recommend doing it weekly. Lol. And also...you are more likely to die if something goes wrong lol. \n\nAnd I mean hey, I frigging LOVE my Hemlibra. Love. It. Nose bleeds that stop on their own. No more random bruises I cannot recall the source of. And a simple shot in the belly fat once a week. So much less time playing thread the vein! Love it. All kinds of goodness. But I imagine that a Hemophiliac saying, \"almost normal life\" is still going to be thinking of something different than a normal individual saying, \"almost normal life.\" Something just.konda tells me we set the bar for almost normal in different places. I dunno. May just be me though. Dam ty ty ty bro. That Is alot of good info. How did helimbra change your life though. Like did spontanious bleeds stop. Can you run more or do more now? What changed. Ty Running is hard on anyone\u2019s joints. I would say do everything you can to stay in shape, but running a lot, like a cross county runner or for sport is probably going to mess up your knees or ankles. Hemlibra will not really change that. I do a lot of hiking, and I can go a long way because I never damaged my joints too badly. I cross country ski too. But running jars your joints so badly that it takes a toll. I think you will get more satisfaction out of being able to walk until you are old age if you lay off running too much. Ok Sucks that im in wrestling rn though. Ive learned alot and want to get it over done with before somthing happens lol. Wrestling might not me as hard on you as running tho. You might get a bleed or whatever, but you probably will not do as much joint damage, unless you hyperextend and elbow or something. Keep working out and you will be less likely to bleed and your muscles will support your joints better. Ty. Ill bike to the gym from now on instead of running. I would. That is the way I stayed in shape and it works great. It is the refusal to infuse that almost definitely causes the issue. I too have been running for years, no problems. I infuse the day of my run, every time. Disclaimer that you should ask your Hemophilia treatment center before making decisions, but if you treat properly, your factor works well for you, and you have no preexisting joint damage, you absolutely can run. I would not like... train for a marathon every year... but a few miles every few days is definitely possible for most people.  I run regularly (2-3 times per week, 3-4 miles per run) and have not had a single issue. I infuse the morning before I go on a run, no exceptions.  No infusion, no run.  I am also diligent about stretching and strengthening workouts, basically injury prevention for any runner with or without hemophilia. Nice. Ty Yes, very thankful to G-d and my medication for making it possible What Is G-d? The Lord, or whatever you would call the higher power. In my religion, it is considered disrespectful to spell out the name, so a hyphen is used in place of the o. Oh ok. Good to know I can only speak on my own experiences. I loved to run, but my ankle did not. At first, medicine, ice, and stretching helped but eventually it did not. I went years with a limp. However I got a joint injection and found a bike. I jumped into cycling because I was able to push\u2019s my body further and harder and not suffer the joint complications. I now race mountain bikes and track bikes and I am the fittest I have ever been. Oh shit nice. Are trck bike the street one A track bike is like a street one but does not have any brakes and one fixed gear. It is meant for an enclosed track! Yes id you are in Helimbra you can most likely run no problem, I have been doing sports for years and just started helimbra almost one year ago and I have been running and doing all kind of stuff and I have not had one single bleed since starting helimbra. Yes, you are probably right. It is really important. What sorta sports? Also before helimbra how was the pther medicine for you? I took factor VIIi, and with that I only did weightlifting, but since I started helimbra I have been doing pretty much everything, calisthenics, kettlebell work, gymnastics, capoeira, running, hiking, volley, kitesurf, wakeboard, I have been having the most fun with my body I ever had. Godam. And 0 pain and bleeds or injurys because of hemophilia? How old are you? 0 problems hemophilic related, I have had some plantar fasciitis for running too much, too soon, I did something like 30 days C25K, first day 4km in 38min last day 5km in 22 min, so pretty pleased with the result but got me injured. I have had some superficial bleeding for impacts in sport but in 2 - 3 days they where gone, I am 22 at the moment and have previous injuries in my ankles which I work on them all the time so I can keep up w the other activities. I have even made a post here a few months ago showing my body results, look at my profile and find it, you get to see for yourself. Picked up cycling around two years ago when I started having ankle issues. Cycling 50+ miles feels way better than walking a mile 26m. Severe 9. I wrestled, tennis and soccer in high school. Heavy weightlifting and cheerleading in college. And while I am glad I did those things it was too much on my body even though I was not experiencing any issues back then. I sort of wish I was just told to bike and swim and lift for longevity sake as I am ready for an ankle replacement now but trying to buy some time.\nAlso one bad injury from those sports can lead to a target joint. I got a hairline fracture in my ankle and went down hill in about two years.\n\nI would take up cycling (road, gravel, Cross country mtb or trail mtb should be fine) and hiking and try to avoid high impact activities.\n\nI think weight lifting is great if your not trying to be a body builder and just lifting to stay in shape. Instead of trying to max out and lift heavy focus on low weight high rep endurance workouts. I think weight lifting has done a ton to protect my joints Too much blood can be kind of corrosive. Bleeding into your joints will slowly strip bone and cartilage. You also have membranes around your joints to help reduce the amount of blood and keep lubricant fluids in it, like your Synovium in your ankle or bursa sac around your elbow. Bleeding into your joint can fringe these membranes too This is definitely a question that you should ask your hematologist. I assume you have Hemophilia A? Do you take clotting factor? How often and is it on a consistent basis? What is your severity? Many hematologists actually suggest working out, swimming, and running as healthy and safe exercises. I actually know of a hemophiliac (A severe) who plays ice hockey.\n\n HEMLIBRA, as you mentioned, allows the patient to inject clotting factor subcutaneously, and has a half-life of  646 hours, or about 4 weeks. It can be taken once a week, once every 2 weeks, or once every 4 weeks. More about HEMLIBRA here: HemoTalk.tk Nice. But i see people saying running is bad I think consistent running such as every day could be bad for the hips, as in anyone. I have hemophilia A severe and ran track for about 9 years. It is usually a good idea for hemophiliacs to strengthen their joints in some way so when they get older there are less problems. I went from having at least one bleed a week to no bleeds over about a 9 month period now, it is been life changing for me I personally done a fair bit of running my self pre-heamlibra but ended up developing osteochondritis dissecans, which is caused by repetitive stress on the joints possibly from the running l it is also quite likely it is  genetics related it was pretty horrendous pre heamlibra, had a lot of bleeding into my forearms and hands aswell which was putting pressure on the nerves and causing muscle wastage in my hands. \n\nMy advice would be keep on top of your fitness because being unfit will lead to having more bleeds which you want to mitigate as much as possible.\n\nEdit: I do not think running is bad for you and should not be a problem if you are using your factor properly, I just got unlucky and ended up with a knee problem that is likely more genetics than it was activity related.\n\nThe heamlibra for me removed a lot of the pains I was having in general and I  take it once every fortnight, I would say if you are having lots of issues and it is becoming difficult to manage heamlibra is probably something you should look into, I have never been told not to do anything just to consider the consequences that your actions may have down the line so if you want to do combat sports then just make sure you are being as safe as possible while doing them. On the topic of weight lifting, the stronger your muscles are the more they protect your joints and also if you have aches and pains going to the gym and working out help massively in managing that pain.\n\nSomething to note is heamlibra does not work for everyone there are issues that can appear that mean you will not be able to continue taking it so I would advise you do your research and ask your doctors lots of questions.", "So, funny story... (partially nsfw) So I have Severe Hemophilia A. This morning I had a dark black poop and freaked the fuck out. So i immediately take my factor and start thinking about if I could have done anything to hurt myself or done anything to cause internal bleeding. Right when I am on the verge of calling my htc and heading to the emergancy room I remember I had two glasses of red wine last night, which always dies my shit a dark purple color.\n\n\n Crisis averted.\n\nSorry if tmi but I figured some of you other bleeders would find it funny. your poop is the window to your health, and also your ass. turns out they are both ok. congrats. it is good to see not bad news. Every time I eat beets...  I thought you were going to say \"then I remembered I had anal sex last night\", since it is NSFW. Poop is not nsfw. That would have been more entertaining. Right? \ud83d\ude0f  This is such a common problem in all people that the GI docs now instruct endoscopy patients to not drink anything like red wine or grape juice during their clear liquid diet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlad I am a pediatric treater, my patients do not drink that much.  ;)", "Question to carriers... Firstly, I would like to preface this question by saying, yes I am talking to a hematologist and yes I will be getting genetic testing but I would like to wait as long as possible as my infant with severe A would need bloodwork as well.\n\nI have no history of hemophilia in my family and am currently working with my son\u2019s hematologist to determine whether I am a carrier or not. Initial bloodwork showed my factor level at 81. Our hematologist said it is unlikely that I am a carrier but will need to do genetic testing to determine for sure. I want to wait to check this because I would really hate to have blood drawn on my son any time soon but I am so curious. Do any carriers on here have levels similar to mine? My mother was the first known carrier in the family. Her factor levels are in the normal range. They determined she was the origin of the mutation after my younger brother was diagnosed.\n\nYou can usually still have relatively normal clotting levels as a carrier since women have two copies of the gene (hence why there is a 50/50 chance a male offspring may be born with it). It is not always the case, however.\n\nWhether the mutation originated with you or your son should not matter as long as you (and any immediate female relatives) are not trying to get pregnant. They should be able to do a genetic test on you without drawing your son\u2019s blood. We would like to have another baby at some point which is why I am so concerned... and I thought the same thing about my bloodwork but I guess we need to figure out which gene is affected to determine where the mutation occurred. We will likely wait a while as I really cannot bear to let him get poked again. \ud83d\ude2d I am not a geneticist by far, but the gene that encodes Factor VIII is located on the X chromosome at the q28 position. Have not heard of other mutations outside of the F8 gene causing hemophilia A. If there is a reason why they would need his blood, I imagine it would be to compare his segment with yours. There is a chance I am wrong, though. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIf you can wait until he is at least 1, venipuncture should not be nearly as difficult. Just make sure you tell whoever is doing the actual stick that he has severe hemophilia\u2014they do not always let phlebotomists know. I think you are right about comparing the segments. I cannot remember the exact reason they needed to draw his blood as well but that sounds familiar. It would really be nice to have my husband in appointments so we can both be listening. It can be so overwhelming... darn COVID. \n\nAnd we will absolutely let them know. Fortunately our hematologist has a lab connected to it specifically for the office\u2019s patients but I am a helicopter mom so I constantly remind people. Lol The only way to tell if you are a carrier is to get a genetic test to look for the mutation. We did IVF to avoid passing it on to our son. I was a known carrier bc my dad had it. I had genetic testing to confirm and to be able to find an embryo without my family mutation. My factor levels have always been within normal range. I have had increased bleeding (nose bleeds, heavy periods, increased bleeding with dental work and minor surgeries) but not to the level of a hemophiliac My daughters are both carriers and one has a level around 40% and the other a level of 65%. But some carriers have levels as high or higher than yours. Having another baby should not be a concern. There are women that we work with that have very low levels and there are things the doctors do to ensure there are no bleeding problems. As far as your boy getting poked, you might have to get used to that if he has hemophilia A. I have hemophilia A, obviously, and I never even noticed when I got infusions as a kid. My mom distracted me and I was more concerned with the motorcycle book I was looking at then what the person with the needle was doing. Just do not make a big deal out of it and hopefully your son will not either. /u/blueishblackbird, I have found an error in your comment:\n\n &gt; \u201clevels and ~~their~~  are things\u201d\n\nI declare the comment by you, blueishblackbird, unacceptable; it should say \u201clevels and ~~their~~  are things\u201d instead. \u2018Their\u2019 is possessive; \u2018there\u2019 is a pronoun or an adverb.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Agree. Just wait for the genetics. And do not let it stop you having more kids! It is way more manageable now than when I was a child (I have severe von willebrands so spent a fair amount of time at my HTC as a kid). \nAlso - spontaneous mutations happen. There does not need to be a family history of a bleeding disorder for one to occur (me!) That is what we are thinking if I am a carrier. There is so much to think about there though,  not to mention the cost. So glad it worked out for you! I am not too worried about myself. My birth with my son went without complications. I am more worried about having another son with hemophilia. I worry about having to split my attention from my first but I would also really like him to have a sibling. I know carriers with levels close to 100... Then there are ones like my sister and me who have mild Hemophilia. You can be a carrier but have different levels of expression.  My dad is a hemophiliac (level around 13).  He passed hemophilia to my sister and me.  We are both technically carriers, but have different levels. Mine is around 19-20 (mild hemophilia) and hers is around 40.  (We do have different mothers though.)\n\nI have a daughter and have not bothered to test her yet, since I have lived my life relatively normally as a mild hemophiliac. I did not even know I was one until I got tested when I was pregnant.  I needed factor for delivery but my day to day life is the same.", "Insurance prior authorization Is anybody having issues getting prescriptions authorized? I have Blue cross blue shield of Florida and have been trying to get on the hemlibra but so far have been denied. Does anyone have experience getting it approved? What was the reason they gave for the denial? All the information I have from the insurance is denied. No reason specified. I have always had to have prior authorization for my Eloctate. Has to be done every year in fact. But usually they get it approved and for whatever reason even appealing the decision they are still flat refusing.its even listed on the formulary as an approved medication for my insurance just needs that auth.  \n\nMy doctor is going to submit again and see if they cannot get it through. Was just curious if anyone had experience convincing the bean the counters at the insurance company to approve medication. The biggest joke is that Florida blue prime therapeutics which is another pharmacy to handle prior authorization claims. Even though the specialty pharmacy that handles all the hemophilia therapies is cvs Caremark. So you get the run around no matter which way you approach it I am involved in writing and reviewing prior authorization guidelines for pharmaceuticals. \n\nGenerally, the guidelines (aka rules) for getting Hemlibra differ based on whether you have inhibitors or not. Many insurances do not require anything else of patients with inhibitors. This is because Hemlibra is much cheaper than for them to pay for than bypassing agents and high dose factor. For people without inhibitors, though, it tends to be more difficult to \"qualify\" for Hemlibra coverage. Generally, the doctor has to show that you have a valid medical reason why you cannot use standard factor treatment regimens, such as IV-access issues, a history of some sort of odd reaction to FVIII, because standard FVIII replacement is cheaper for insurances to pay for. \n\nThere is more and more evidence coming out demonstrating that Hemlibra may have significant benefits over FVIII in people without inhibitors, but do not expect many insurances to make any significant changes any time soon. Which is strange because by my math the hemlibra should  be cheaper overall than Eloctate. I am racking up close to 70k a month for my current treatment. Which by my math should make the hemlibra a little cheaper to prophy. Even though I guess technically there would be a little cost since you have to keep Eloctate on hand as backup. \n\nGuess it is true what they say though. The insurance companies really are not in the business of helping patients. So no tips for how to change their mind if say you do not have inhibitors and have not had injection issues? I have heard the hemlibra users are feeling less joint related pain. I may be fortunate in other hemophilia related issues but I certainly have the arthritis pain problem. Have you tried this?\n\n( I have not but that seems to be more geared to co pay assist as opposed to uncooperative insurance companies. I have been on Hemlibra since it was approved. It is costing my insurance company much less, no doubt, but it is billed differently than fVIII. FVIII is billed under \u201cmajor medical\u201d, while Hemlibra is billed as a prescription medication. Maybe your insurance is set up as such that you cannot spend that much on prescriptions? I did not have a problem getting approved, but it did take two tries. The Dr had to reword the script, then it went through. But I have been having trouble accessing veins, and was using a lot of factor. I also wanted to say that I never had joint pain until I started Hemlibra. I was dosing with Hemlibra every two weeks and the joint pain (arthralgia) was really bad and I considered going off of Hemlibra. But I switched to the weekly dose , which is half the medicine but weekly instead of every two weeks, and I am tolerating it well. It seems that I was having some kind of reaction to the high dose all at once, and halving it was enough to make my body able to tolerate it. Just be aware that some people do experience increased joint stiffness on Hemlibra, and apparently it can be lessened by doing it every week, rather than every two weeks or monthly. I did not notice the pain and stiffness until around the second month, and it is only in the mornings, or when I sit still a long time, and it goes away for the most part within seconds of being in a hot shower. I started to have really bad tendonitis in my elbow, and when I decreased the dose it has been getting better. Still not gone though. Good luck getting on Hemlibra. Even doing weekly injections under the skin beats infusing every other day. And I have had almost no bleeds since I started (besides falling off of a ladder, and I infused as I normally would for a week). So if there were no side affects for me I would say it is a miracle medicine, even with side affects it is pretty great. If you contact the insurance company they have to give you the reason they denied it. The only reasons I had it denied it was missing a code. Some of the insurance companies are starting to say you have to use specific brands though. I would start off by contacting the company and go from there. \"We are dedicated to helping you understand your insurance coverage and assistance options.\u00a0\"\n\nSeems like it is worth a try. Yeah I used the web page to take a quick look. I am going to try calling them though. Might be better off giving a person the specifics. Call your insurance company and get somebody to explain exactly why it was declined.  It might be financial which is hard to overcome but it may very well be something as simple as the wording of the prescription or a coding issue.  In my experience the insurance rep will be pretty open and honest about what happened and how to work around it.  Good luck. From what I have heard and read it sounds amazing. Sounds like the joint pain and stiffness you experience is about the same I have already. I have been on Eloctate for a few years now and it is been by far very good but the hemlibra just sounds like it is so much better overall plus like you said only infusing once a week sounds much nicer. I do not expect it To turn my life around. I am getting a bit older as hemophiliac go (30) so I was kind of one of the guinea pigs early on and I know my joints are basically towards the end of their life. Fortunately it is just my ankles. I had knee surgery when I was five and I was the youngest patient (at the time) for that. Which cured my knee problems overall. \n\nStill seems like hemlibra is the way to go. I have been trying to remain active and keep my joints healthy and everything I have read and heard of the hemlibra just sounds like a huge quality of life improvement. Anyway. Hopefully I am able to get them to do it. The doctors office is going to resubmit. Unfortunately I am not near enough a htc so I am relying on a hematologist who at times seems to know less than I do lol. I am joking of course but it is a little upsetting that I have to calm and get them on it again. I have stated my desire to try the hemlibra I would like for them to keep trying till they get it approved. Quick up date for those inquiring minds... insurance company says \u201cnot medically necessary\u201d so I guess I will see if the doctor can correct that aspect on the authorization forms. As someone who is had most of their medication denied atleast once before being approved, I recommend taking it to court if it is not approved again. Seems like a lot, but the process is not that hard, not too expensive either, and most of the time the judge will side with you. I thought about that myself actually. Wonder if there was legal recourse. I am 30 now. I have had my medication denied several times over the years now myself. They claim this time it is not medically necessary. Checked into that they seem to think I may qualify for free meds through them so we are going to see how it goes I guess. Supposed to be faxing some documents for my doctor to fill out. Well that would be pretty nice. There might be, but I have never gotten any. Though I would say to focus more on getting the medication than getting compensation Well naturally. Meds are the most important fortunately I am not without meds. I have done that in the past though when they decided to not renew my prior authorization and not tell anyone till I was out of meds. Usually happens about once a year that they try to deny me meds. Sorta a joke. That is one of those that requires a creative touch from the doctor.  It is probably more to do with a new product being misunderstood. Good luck, and let us know how it works for you if you do get approved.  I am still on the fence myself and I am sure I will have work to do with my insurance company should I decide to make the switch. Sounds to me like the person reviewing it is like why does he need that he has Eloctate. It is like yeah I guess technically I do not need it. But it would be a huge quality of life improvement if it works half as good as they say. Insurance companies, in general, tend to suck unfortunately.\n\nI have spoken with multiple hemophilia treatment center docs about Hemlibra, but it is been awhile. I will review my notes and see if I can find any tips that may help you obtain coverage. If it makes you feel any better, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida will not approve our breast pump claim. Tried through a company and bought one at Target cheaper than the company without insurance. They have claimed everything from not covering over the counter, request for prior authorization for them over a certain price, not being medical grade, being medical grade, etc.  Even though it is supposed to be covered under ACA, they have denied us twice.", "Starting Hemlibra We started the paper work for hemlibra this week.  I will likely switch over from Advate by December.  Reading about the experiences of the group was very encouraging Mind sharing any of the things you read? Were they online? Thinking of making the switch myself If you scroll through the group you will find stories that paint a picture of satisfaction that seems very high.  Truth be told I made my mind up before it was even on the market for hemophilia A I am starting on the 21th October! Also switching from Advate You guys are going to be amazed. If for some reason you get stiff joints in the morning, this can be a side affect called arthralgia. It usually is not that bad and goes away after a few weeks. But if you are like me, I had it pretty bad. It took a couple months until I almost considered stopping hemlibra. But I decided that instead of taking 2cc\u2019s every 2 weeks, I would try taking 1cc every week. That solved the problem for me. No more arthralgia at all. My guess is that 2cc\u2019s of the delivery system (which is kind of a flu like vaccine sort of thing) was causing achy joints, like the flu. It was an immune response to the delivery system. But 1cc is not enough to trigger my bodies immune response. This has happened to a few other people as well since I went through it. Over all it was no big deal at all, I just like to tell people Incase it happens to them. 1 sub q shot a week is nothing. And if you have a bad fall and still get a bleed, just infuse some Advate just like usual. Just finished my last loading dose of HemLibra. Every two weeks from here on out and do not have to intravenously inject anymore, unless I get a bad bleed. Good luck to you! My dad just switched to Hemlibra and it is the first time ever he had a nose bleed that just STOPPED", "What is the meanest thing anyone has done to you when finding out you got a bleeding disorder? I did an exam on family genetics, everyone else was doing it about why their eyes are a certain colour, why their hair is curly and so on. I choose to tell about my bleeding disorder and how my aunt having it leading to my mom getting tested and told she was not sick and there was no risk of transferring it down to her children (oh the 60s, how you ruined my life). \n\nAfter my presentation my teacher basically walked up and pinched me in the arm saying \"females cannot have bleeding disorders, if you did your arm would be bruising by now\".... My bruise gave me the highest grade in that course and I never saw that A-hole teacher again. Od have punched that bastard in the face\n\nPeople just crack jokes at me, but I have heard every \"hemo\" joke you can think of and it takes the wind out of their sails when I do not laugh or take any offense to them. Holy crap. That is not okay. The husband and I made jokes about that I could survive a stabbing (Factor 13 that can cause me to clot easier or bleed depending on apparently what ever direction the wind is blowing) and I openly joke about being a mutant. That is some incredibly immature behavior. When and where was this? That is assault. \n\nThat is someone who should not be a teacher. I have never, not one time had an adult make fun of me for having a bleeding disorder. Children on the other hand, sure, because children are little psychopaths until they are more fully actualized. just people calling me homofobic since it \u201csounds similar\u201d In all honesty the worst for me when was I had a leg bleed in middle school at 7th grade and my bitch of a pe teacher who was fully aware of my hemophilia and did not attend my iep meetings to help me adjust to the class and make the grade and decided she had enough my \"bs\" fake illness (her words not mine) calls me out in front of the whole class while I recovered from a leg bleed a week prior due to me having severe hemophilia and demands for me to get up and I told her I could not and she starts to yell calling me a liar who takes advantage of the government who could be helping people with real illnesses i was then sent to the principal office for disobedience and disruptive behavior cause I had a mental breakdown soon after and this was the moment the teacher had fucked up because what she did not know what that my mom do not play games with teachers she ripped that teacher a new one and was it worth it since she had multiple complaints before which got her fired My uncle's ex wife told everyone in my home town (less than 10k people) that my brother had aids.  We were both born in the 80s after the outbreak.\n\nI had a CNA ask me how long I would been on H and pointed out my track marks.  That was pretty humiliating.  I do not go to that doctor anymore, but I am afraid it is in my chart.  GD rednecks, man. I get the same thing on daily basis, I do not get offended by it I just wish they could come up with funnier, more original jokes Reminds me of myself when I was first grader. I am from a 3rd world country and had no access to factors 16 years ago even though I was a severe. I was always happy to go to school coz I rarely could go, but one day I forgot to take my diary and this bitch of a teacher mocked me by saying how I was tourist in my own class. Even as a first grader that felt oh so humiliating :( i was called homophiliac until i graduated This was 2017, University, guy was a professor, I did not need to do much as I had 30+ witnesses to it and the bruise to prove it so that guy never worked at that campus ever again. I did not want to get police involved as the uni board was on my side. My country is pretty shit with punishment so he would look at a maximum of like 250 dollar fines. Not worth the extra stress of dealing with it. Jesus fucking Christ. I hate doctors. I got several puncture wounds on my arm from testing my bleeding times and all my doctors think that I self harm, does not matter how much I tell them that it is from medical evaluations they still get psych involved every time. You would think that someone who spent 1/3 of their life in school would be smart, sadly most doctors are so stupid it is painful. And my wife wonders why I do not tell anyone.  Life's difficult enough. Go Mom!   \n\n\nSpending so much time of your day with someone like that and you can kind off see why so many kids turns out like a-holes. When I was 17 I missed school for a month, when I got back I was wearing black, no make up, no joy and pretty much on the verge of crying all the time. My mentor asked me who died as a joke, My dad was not the answer he was expecting. It was a glorious dumpster fire after that. My parents kept it low and as I grew up I did the same...maybe 1-2 teachers and maybe a feu close family members.

And we are not doctors around here, sorry, so I would be hesitant to listen to the advice of a group of anonymous people when it comes to the safety of consuming expired medication. I know it sucks, but I would dump it. Not worth the infection or reaction you could get. No way. It is expensive but not worth dying for. It is possible you could use it and be fine, and possible you could get a systemic infection, blood poisoning, something bad like that. I am not a doctor, just a hemophiliac, but no. Not worth the risk. Just say you used it, toss it , and say you needed to use more for another injury if you are worried about insurance or whatever. Definitely not. Most package inserts say how long it lasts after mixing.

It is pretty tolerable and actually feels better when i am active then when i am resting. Does anyone know what this could be? If you think it is a bleed you should treat it, rest, and ice it. You could try some hip stretches ( . If it persists talk to your doctor. I sometimes get hip pain from sitting too much and the stretches help relieve it. Good luck! Sounds like arthritis.  When the cartilage is worn down in a joint, we experience some discomfort and the more it wears down, the discomfort can become pain and the pain can become chronic.  Exercise can be helpful but too much of the wrong type of exercise/activity can do more damage.  If you have an HTC, mention it to your doctor and physical therapist if they have one on staff.  Your doc can refer you if necessary but a physical therapist can give you specific exercises and stretches that may help with the pain and mobility.  The sooner you start properly dealing with these problems, the better.  Walking to compensate for you hip will put undue stress on your knee, ankle, back, etc... and could lead to other problems.  You might be able to google up some exercises and stretches to try for now.  Of course you need to talk to your doctor and get x-rays to check things out to confirm it is arthritis but whatever it is, take care of it sooner than later.  Just as an example, I ignored a hip injury as a teenager and eventually my body decided to repair itself by growing a calcium deposit that severely reduced my hip's range of motion.  Take care of yourself.  I guarantee every one of us old guys think back and wish we would done things at least a little differently.  Every bleed or problem adds up and if you feel it at 16, you are definitely going to feel it at 60.  Medical science keeps getting better but you need to take care of yourself the best you can in the mean time.  Good luck. I have right hip pain too\u2026 going on 10 years now.

", "Ankle fusion Hello, i made a post a couple months ago saying i was going to get an akle fusion and a lot of people asked me to let them know how it went. I am now 7 months post-op and i can tell you, its the best darn decision i'ce ever made. I am basically pain free, i can walk 10km easily (couldnt even walk 1 before) im limp free and i can finnaly enjoy the outdoors again. If you are hesitating i can guarantee that it will ve worth it. Great! I am severe and have had both hips &amp; left knee knee replaced. No pain is gr8! BTY it is not \"a limp\" always a swagger! Welcome to the club. It is a weird feeling not having to worry about just walking anymore. Glad it worked out for you! I know!! It feels like i have a new ankle! Damn, im sorry you had to go through all of that! This my first major surgery (im only 17) but yes no pain is awesome! That is awesome, congrats! Do you mind me asking what age you are? I am 25 and very active outdoors and find both my ankles are really holding me back now. Every time I bring up fusion, though, I am told I am too young to be considering it. Did you find this? Thanks for the update. I have experienced the relief of chronic pain by having my knees replaced but have always been curious about ankle fusions.  FWIW, they are practically \"fused\" now with only a couple of degrees of movement left and very little pain, but in my teenaged years and twenties, my ankles were my most common cause of pain.  I am glad you got the surgery while you are young.  We have enough pain to deal with, enjoy your new found mobility.  Just curious, is the fusion expected to last a lifetime or is there a chance you will need other work done in the future? Thank you :) they didnt say anything about future surgeries so im hoping its for a lifetime. I am 17 so im sure youll be fine :) good luck I am also part of a gene therapy trial and have not had to take F8 for almost 2 years! It is weird, the last of my factor just expired. Omg!! Ive never tried that, i do not think its very popular in canada. Must be awesome to not infuse!! I am 25 and have severe B. I was told my ankle is that of a 70-80 year old, in terms of cartilage. My ankle specialist told me that a fusion is always an option, but taking my age and occupation into consideration (I am a nurse) he said I should wait until I am older. I have chronic pain. I can walk long distances with some pain and be okay, but afterwards it will stiffen up and hurt worse for a while. \n\nBasically, my question is when would you recommend getting this done? What was your day to day like? Was your range of motion completely gone before surgery? \n\nI have always been afraid that, yes a fusion will get rid of my pain, but that I will limp more and be less mobile with it fused. Is that not the case? \n\nSorry for all the questions, this is something that has been in the back of my mind for a while now. Hey! Im a severe A and I will tell you that the fusion was the best decision in my life, im 17 i had 0 cartilage left, couldnt walk a km without extreme pain, i was missing all my school and i was getting more and more depressed and j couldnt do any outdoor activity whatsoever. \n\nI would suggest getting it as soon as possible, when you are still young you heal faster, you will have to be on sick leave for a while (3-4 months) but after that i guarantee you wont regret it. \n\nI have almost as much motion now as i had before, but without the pain. Theres 2 joints in you foot that provide motion, the other one just has to work a bit more now. I can drive, walk, hike and i recently started to try jogging, i have not felt this good in about 5 years.\n\nHope this enlightens you in your decision, it is a tough one to make i am aware of that, still feels extremely weird to not have an ankle anymore, but you get used to it pretty fast.\n\nGood luck, shoot me a message if you have any more questions, i love talking about it to help others :) Not on market, just trial phase at the moment. It is weird not infusing. I normally did 3 times a week before treatment. This is good to read. I am so scared of it :( r/bleedwriter Wow man that sounds amazing. So you do not notice any limp at all? I know this sounds dumb, but the main reason I am apprehensive about doing it is because I am scared of having to limp around all the time. Most of the time I can walk normally, unless I have been really active and am in pain. \n\nDid your ortho doc clear you to jog/walk that much? Or is it something you feel comfortable doing? I cannot tell you how badly I would just like to go for a run. If a fusion could help me just jog I would be ecstatic. \n\nThanks so much for answering my questions. Yup. Having mine done was the best thing ever too. \n\nHow much movement do you have? I had a lot more than I thought I would Me too! I was pleasantly suprised to see how much movement i had! I can barely tell the difference, only when im driving. I used to limp really bad before the fusion so maybe that is why i dont notice any limping but people around me say that they cant notice any limp so im guessing im walking pretty good.\n\nHavent seen my ortho in a while because of the virus so im just doing what i feel comfortable with.\n\nNo problem at all if you have any more ask away. :) Ok, ill have to talk to my hematologist about it next time. I infuse every 2 days so it would be such a relief to not have to do it anymore. It sire is a HUGE decision, and it will hurt a lot in the first couple months im not going to lie, but if your ankle is as bad as me, you wont regret it. Dont know what this is lol Which trial are you in? One for Biomarin. Probably will not be on the market for at least 5+ years.

", "So my wife has type A hemophilia and has questions about pregnancy and getting tattoos. So my wife has hemophilia type A and her hematologist (who had never had a female patient before) could not give her many answers. On top of that she moved so right now she is without a doctor. She was wondering if child birth was still possible for her or what kind of complications she should expect?\n\nShe also wanted to get a tattoo (I have plenty) and I was not sure if she could with hemophilia. I have seen a post here before about guys taking factor 8 before and after however her insurance will not cover her to get factor 8. So should she still be ok to get a tattoo?\n\nIf anyone has answers to one or both of these questions that would be awesome! Hey there! First off let me start by saying this: Her hematologist should, if unable to answer the questions herself, be able to get in touch with other hematologists to get a medical opinion about her treatment. **I am not a doctor**; I am a community advocate and bleeder myself, but I do not have any special training or knowledge in this area.\n\nThat said, I found ( which seems like a good place to start. It says what you would expect: Pregnancy is not life-threatening with hemophilia or other bleeding disorders, and childbirth itself is not much different from individuals with normal clotting factor levels, but she should *absolutely* still have a hematologist as part of her pre-pregnancy care, and her clotting factor levels should be closely monitored.\n\nAs for tattoos, ( from Hemaware (the magazine put out by the National Hemophilia Foundation) details a number of potential problems regarding tattoos, and discusses ways to ensure that the tattoo procedure is safe for your wife.\n\nMore disconcerting (to me, speaking without any understanding of your situation whatsoever) is that she has hemophilia and is being denied access to Factor 8. If she has a prescription for factor, she may be able to contact one of the companies who produces factor products and get a small amount of factor for her to have on-hand (usually 3-6 doses). If she is living in the US she may be able to get in touch with her local ( who can help get her access to Factor 8, as well as a staff of individuals who should have access to plenty of information for her and her physician. You might also try having her reach out to her local chapters of either the ( or the ( as one of the main roles of these chapters is ensuring the safety and well-being of people with bleeding disorders in their area. They will be able to offer tailored, local resources to her. Apologies if you know all of the above already; my goal here is to be thorough :)\n\nHopefully the above will help. Please let us know if you or your wife have more questions or if you need anything else. Thank you so much. I just read this to my wife and she said it was a beautiful response and extremely helpful. She did not know of any of these resources and we thank you for taking the time to type all of that out. Not sure about the pregnancy part of your question, but I can help with the tattoo part. I have Hemophilia A, and have 5 tattoos now (actually just got the 5th yesterday). Those would be on my foot, ribs, back, above my knee, and around my whole calf/shin. I did not Factor before getting any of these. \n\nIf it helps, I am a 4%er, and considered moderate. Just have to be cautious of getting something on a part of the body that swells. My shin and now top of foot swelled more than anything else has. I put ice on it and kept it up during the recovery, but it did not immobilize me like actual injuries have. \n\nHope that helps. Happy to answer any other tattoo questions I can.  Awesome thanks. Yah I am not sure where she is going to get it either but I will be sure to let her know. I believe she is considered moderate as well. I think she was afraid of the color running or something but I said I had not heard of that happening before.  I have not heard of color running either. My calf/shin is pretty large (took about 15 hours to put it in perspective) and it is all in color. I have not seen any issues with it running. To be honest, I had no idea females could be hemophiliacs. I thought they were carriers only. I thought that as well and when my wife told me when we first started dating I immediately thought she was just making up stuff just to sound interesting I was born with severe hemophilia A and I got a couple tattoos when I turned 21. I am on prophylaxis factor 8 for background. For my first tattoo I stuck to my same 3x a week schedule and it took forever to heal. My second tattoo I took some extra factor 8 during the healing process and it healed much quicker (2 weeks compared to around 4) \n\n\nJust wanted to chime in with my experience. Factor 8 definitely helps. Also when you sign to get a tattoo there is a check box that says \"I do not have hemophilia\" tbh I lied on the form. I did all the research but I did not want the artist to worry. I factored before and everything went smoothly. Not advocating for lying but just letting you know it is what I did Oh ok I do not recall my former saying anything about hemophilia but it makes sense. We are currently working on getting her some factor 8 since she has never been able to get it before.  Get to a Hemophilia Treatment Center.  In the US, you can find one close to you on the either the CDC Hemophilia page or the NHF site (hemophilia.org).  She will benefit from establishing care and plugging in with a high risk OB (Maternal-Fetal Medicine) clinic that they work with.\n\nAffected Carriers are out there.  These women can be as bad as moderate hemophiliacs.  She should skip right past the community hospitals and establish care with an HTC and then get referred to an OB they work with regularly.  Keeps all the records in 1 place and makes communication smooth. I know a woman who Carries it with slightly lower levels and before ops and birth I believe she gets a small amount of factor.

Thanks friends!", "COVID, Hemophilia, and the USA Hope  you guys are staying strong. I am a Hemo B mild, and I will have  to go to the USA for college in January (and we all know how the US is doing with its 200k cases per day...). I am a bit worried about how covid could impact me and whether if covid + hemophilia could lead to something serious. If you guys got COVID (I hope not), did you develop any serious conditions as a result of hemophilia? That would  be great if you could share any insight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw, I read through this case study which seems to highlight that there was no significant problems for a man with hemophilia:\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, WFH says there could be some serious problems:\n\n( Had it, had zero issues as far as Hemophilia goes\n\nSevere A Great, happy that you did not face any problems Same here! No issues what so ever. Also A, Severe The issue now may be hospital capacity depending where you are going. If ICUs are full and hospitals have cancelled elective procedures if something serious where to happen then getting treatment could be a problem. I appreciate that. I wish you safe passage to my my country and the best health, brother Has not been enough time to properly study the long term effects of COVID on the body, let alone the impact on hemophilia.  I am Mild A and an ICU nurse, follow precautions, wear a mask, avoid contact with anyone you do not live with, wash your hands often.  Too many things are uncertain, this has not even been around for a year. We are in a hard-hit area.  The biggest concern is safety and accessibility of emergency treatment in the event of a non-COVID incident or injury.  A slip and fall on the ice, for example, would normally mean a few hours at the local Emergency Room (ER).  Now, it would mean a very long time trying to get seen at an overly crowded ER, and the risk of being in a tight space around others who are obviously ill.  Medical staff may be less qualified (or less supervised if new) and more exhausted than under normal circumstances. \n\nA friend recently went in for a different issue and was going to be admitted, but spent the night instead in an ER a hallway because the hospital had no beds.  At the end of the very long next day, they were sent home with an IV and medications and instructions to call an ambulance if they \"crashed\". That is unprecedented in our mid-sized town. So - a big goal is not to take unnecessary risks right now.  It is not a great time for ice skating or mountain biking or using a chef's knife after a few drinks. Why tempt fate?\n\nSecondly, in severe cases of COVID with certain complications, treatment protocols suggest anticoagulants - even for persons with hemophilia. That is complicated, and it is important that a hematologist consults with treating physicians before and during treatment.  The overtaxed medical system in the US is making this sort of collaboration between medical professionals more difficult. \n\nI would recommend that you talk with your current hemophilia treatment physician before you head to the US.  Would they be willing to do a consultation by phone if needed?  Would they be willing to share your patient information with a hemophilia treatment center near your college?  If your current physician can share recent records, that center might be willing to do a telehealth (video conference) visit with you to establish you as a patient without requiring you to come in.  That way, you will have a name and contact information in the event of serious infection. \n\nLastly, be mindful of everyday health practices.  Take precautions even when those around you do not seem to be taking things seriously.  You will discover that some college students are not taking guidelines to heart because they feel a bit invincible, and are pretty sure this virus will not hurt them much.  One common school of thought seems to be, \"Go ahead and live the social college life - just do not go around great-grandma to keep *her* safe.\"  \n\nIt may take some bravery on your part to communicate that, as another poster pointed out, there are still unknowns about how this virus affects people with hemophilia in the long run, and you would rather not mess with it.  Wear your mask and ask those around you to do the same.  Steer clear of parties and large gatherings.  Carry and use hand sanitizer and wipes to clean tables in classrooms.  I know you know all of that - but it may be a little trickier in real life at a new school, than in a community where everyone acknowledges common sense guidelines.   If anyone makes rude comments, do not let it get to you.  You future is more important than their moment of judginess. One more thing you might want to do before you go or soon after arriving is to figure out who you can talk with if you feel stressed or have concerns.  And, find like-minded friends who will support you. \n\nHere is wishing you a beautiful new year and all the best adventures at college! Obviously it is different for everyone but I had what I would call a medium case covid in June and I did not suffer any side-affects at all in regards to hemophilia. I would not worry too much. The chances of having hemophilia complications with covid is very, very low. Had not thought of that, thanks! Awesome! Thanks for the insight! Wow, thank you a lot for this information! That is a lot of great information. I appreciate it. Have a great holiday and new year to you too! That is reassuring, thanks! Thanks man, stay safe! I have done a ton of research since COVID first hit the media.  So, what you do not hear in the main stream media is that blood type matters when it comes to the virus.  Sure they mentioned it one time maybe, but it really does.  If you are type O you are at less risk of contracting or getting a serious case of the covid.  And because the virus causes clotting issues in people this is one time I will be grateful to have a bleeding disorder.  Not being able to clot effectively may just be the saving grace of for the blood disorder community.  Now, I am not 100% on that, but I can say that my theory so far has proven accurate.  If anyone knows of someone with a clotting deficiency that DID get a serious case of the COVID please let me know so I can record it.  But as of right now, I think as long as you stay away from crowded places and protect yourself you should be ok.  Hope this helps. While it has only been almost 1 year, the long term affects of the COVID are in fact being seen.  I myself know several people who, while they did not have a severe case of the virus, are still suffering long term effects from it.  They all got it early in the pandemic, so between 9 to 11 months suffering with residual covid.  It makes me hurt for them.  And while they are not apart of this community, it is still awful.  The problem I see with this is several parts long.\n\nFirst, can you really say they are cured if they are still suffering? I looked up the definition just so I was straight, but recovered means that the body has returned to its pre-issue state.  If you are a long hauler that is not the definition of what you are going through.\n\nNext, they keep extending the length of time someone can shed contagious virus for.  Last I saw it was up to 70 or more days passed initial onset.  That means people who are 'recovered' are still shedding live contagious virus for that long.  But, it is ok CDC let us decrease the quarantine length, ok? \n\nNext, there is a NEW more aggressive strain in the UK. For Pfizer to say that 'there is no reason to think their vaccine will not protect against that'? Really, did you prepare the antimutation vaccine....its a miracle....\n\nSorry for the extra thick sarcasm, but come on.  How stupid do they think humans are?\n\nThat is the end of my rant now.  I hope I was able to share info you did not know and give you something to think about.  And, in terms of treatment, I am just going to say this once.  Viruses and bacteria cannot develop resistance to plant based medicine, and when my husband got covid no one else in my house did and he was legit over it in 3 days.  We have been researching deep into what makes this thing tick and we do not listen to the news.  Anyway, I hope everyone has a wonderful rest of their day. Wow, that is a really great insight! I never even thought about it. Thank you for sharing this with us! That is good to now that being a hemophiliac does not hurt us as much for once. Yeah... all I was saying was that it has not been a year yet so there could be quite literally a million different problems that are discovered after we can study covid for longer, aka long term affects.  The point of my post was to say: literally no one knows yet and no one even know when we will find out ALL of the long term effects let alone how they affect hemophilia, so you should probably assume the worst of cases of you are worried in any way and protect yourself by all means suggested by the CDC.\n\nThe mutation would still be at its core the COVID 19 virus, Pfizer is correct that it is pretty likely their and others vaccines will cover the new mutation; much like the flu shot does every year.  Looking forward to getting dose 1 myself next week. Ok, let me ask this: every year do you get the same flu shot? \nI will answer: No, because they have to account for mutation.\n\nI will absolutely NOT be getting vaccinated because what you do not hear about are the 22 SEVERE reactions that happened during testing.  All they talk about on the news is bodyaches, headache, fever and all gone within a day.  Here is an article showing the FDA admitting to these 22 adverse reactions to the vaccine (\n\nYou cannot blindly follow what the main stream media is trying to shove down your throat without doing your own research.

My doctor told me bleeding disorder medication makes up like 75% (or something) of all the profit in entire drug industry.

Thanks and I look forward to learning more from all of you.\n\nEdit: I searched the subreddit and saw this has been discussed before, but it was 12 and 24 months ago. I figure there may be new stuff out there since a year ago. Pretty impressive to go 16 months without a severe diagnosis!\n\nYou should consult with your hematologist - they may have a specific app they have patients use, or the company that makes your factor might offer an app of their own. Your drug company usually has its own app.\n\n16 month diagnosis is not unusual. Medical professionals will take time to check bleeding not due to child abuse or accident before ordering tests.  I personally use MicroHealth on Android. They might have an iOS app too. HemMobile is also an okay app, although I prefer MicroHealth.  Talk to your factor provider and also your HTC. HemMobile, I think you can sign up and they also send you a free fitness tracker. I think that is US only. I am actually thinking of building a web app for my wife and I to use. What is it that you are interested in tracking other than date, factor amt, etc? Not sure yet! We are in the hospital today having his port placed. Maybe reminders to infuse? Factor re-order reminders (although I think our son\u2019s factor is auto-reordered)? I have seen some that log bleeds. \n\nI am a designer by day, and so clean design is personally important to me. Currently I like the way the MicroHealth app looks and its features. Time will tell if it gets the job done.  Nice! I am new to development so looking for a few projects to work on. My wife and I talked about this recently. My son gets factor every 3 days. Reminders would be super helpful for us too. And, good luck to you! My son is 7 and he is had his port since he was 11 months old. We are working away from the port and toward self infusion. He is ready for it. I am not sure we are though!

If you have a hemophilia treatment center you go to, they typically have physical therapists who can help with this. Otherwise I would say you should go with options that are low- or no-impact, like a stationary bike, swimming, walking, etc. Weight training, when done with the proper form, can also help protect joints by adding some muscle, but again, form is really important. I have been exercising regularly for about 15 years now and there are some things which I have had to stop doing because they seemed to cause trouble, so keep in mind what feels fine today may not in the future. Even things like HIIT yoga I had done for a while eventually seemed to cause bleeding. Now what I do is exclusively recommended by a physical therapist I trust and have worked with for years. Start slow and build up over time. What were the things you had to stop doing? Running, pullups, yoga (on a hard surface at least). Probably more but I do not remember them right now. I have settled into the weight training I do with no issues for the last five years or so: squats, dead lifts, curls, bench press, and body weight stuff which I alternate days with Try cycling or join a biking group.\nIt is a relatively low impact sport and you get to be outside. So you are telling me to join hell\u2019s angels? Whatever works for you buddy! Lap swimming if you are a proficient swimmer.\n\nAlso, water aerobics does not look like a real workout because typically you just see old people doing it, but trust me it is a work out and low impact too. I cycle a lot and have lost a lot of body fat. Apart from that walk, walk, walk! Swim, bike, walk. I have a bad ankle, bad elbow, and bad shoulder. All on various sides, so I cannot reliably stick to any traditional workouts like squats or walking or pushups because I will inevitably have a stretch of bad days where I just do not want to stick to a regimen.\n\nWhat works for me is having a gym available with a variety of machines, and just doing targetted workouts with whatever is not feeling too bad.\n\nAt home, I really like doing some core back exercises, because that is what I need to stretch and build strength in the most. Superman, Superman Punches, Pelvic Tilt / Glute Bridge, and Reverse Bird Dog. All start from laying down, and do not strain my joints. It would be better for me to do something that uses my bodyweight against me, but ust have not found something that reliably works for me. Come on guys!  \nIn any case, you need to clearly define the goal, so the top-starter asks how to reduce body fat mass, and not increase muscle mass.

Like I said, I do not have access to infusions unless I am hospitalized. I will ask my hematologist about this but any advice or has anyone who does not self infuse gotten a tattoo? I have got mild hemophilia A and I have got two tattoos without any treatment whatsoever. Not necessarily saying that was wise on my part, but I did not have any issues. This might be bad advise, but if it were me and I really wanted a tattoo I would probably start slow, maybe get the outline done and see how that goes. Then get a little done  at a time. If you end up needing factor you could always go to the ER. I doubt it would be bad enough to really be a health risk. It might just get a little more swollen and if it is too much of a bother then you might have to go to the ER and infuse. 12% is probably enough to keep you from having serious problems I would think. I know plenty of hemophiliacs with tattoos and have never heard them mention any trouble. try to see if your hematologist will prescribe a dosage for the event I have hemophilia A at 8% and did not have any issues. Do not do it bro my cousin tried to tattooing( type A more than 1 percent) a quote on his elbow it turned out to BE REALLY BAD the arm was all blue he could not move it for days, he is alright now but he suffered for almost a month I think the advice about taking it slow is best, everyone reacts differently. Thought I would add that I have heard of many severe\u2019s having no issue, but one of the more annoying risks is the ink can bleed out a lot more Factor is so expensive I cannot imagine getting some because you want a tattoo.

No, was only recently diagnosed so have not been able to get set up with an HTC yet I would hope that an HTC hematologist would do everything possible to make ER visits an absolute last resort.

I have been considering this for a bit and it seems like becoming a CO is not much different in terms of medical disqualifications from becoming a police officer. Any information whether provided from experience or just knowledge is appreciated.  Basically the same as any other job:\n\n- How severe are you and would your management of the disorder interfere with the duties?\n\n- What are the basic physical requirements and can you meet/exceed them? (I assume that like any other LE position there would be some sort of physical test)\n\n- Are you fully aware of how strenuous the job will be and confident that you can do it on a daily basis? Conservation officer = lots of time on your feet outdoors, I would assume.\n\n- How supportive would the workplace be? Think of the most reasonable worst-case scenario: you have an ankle bleed and you just cannot get out of bed. Is it easy to call in and have someone cover for you? Are you going to catch shit from your bosses? Will it damage your reputation?\n\nIf you are severe I would maybe give it a bit of thought because of the physical aspect of the job, if you are mild/moderate you could be fine? You are checking hunting permits, not doing drug busts in downtown Baltimore, how dangerous can it be. As a Baltimore native, all I can say is: ( This is now a reminder to myself to finally watch season 4 and 5. The big question like others said is how severe you are . I know in Texas game wardens get called in when they need extra law enforcement for disasters and get into some pretty physical stuff. They also work alone a good bit so that is something to consider. Though if you are working with a partner you could be putting them in danger also if you cannot perform at full capacity.  Any law enforcement job could put you in contact with people acting stupid who could injure you. I do not want to dissuade you just putting it out there.

Before I was prescribed Stimate, my nosebleeds lasted anywhere from 3-6 hours.

Considering the workload,  what do you  suggest is the ideal career  for a hemophiliac?  I am a software developer and my job even gave me a special chair to minamise an already super safe job so I do not get uncomfortable wrists  There is no ideal career for a Generic Hemophiliac, because there is no Generic Hemophiliac - everyone has different tolerances, different joint issues, different treatment plans.\n\nI work as a journalist/photographer so most of my week is sitting at the computer writing stuff, and the rest of the time I am hauling 40 pounds of gear around the city and running around stadiums taking photos.\n\nPreviously I worked as an English teacher, which was a stressful job for all the wrong reasons (lots of standing, poor diet, stress, poor sleep schedule).\n\nIt is a lot easier to think about what jobs are *not* ideal careers (extreme manual labor, lots of standing, etc). I agree with /u/dokool, there is no ideal career for a any hemophiliac. It all comes down to the person's strengths and weakness.  It you spring bleeds constantly, you should not be in your feet constantly. If you you are more of a mild bleeder, maybe you can. It all depends on the person. \n\nFor example: I am a RN and can walk between 2-4 miles every night, sometimes more, but I do not spring bleeds as easily anymore since I started Alprolix. \n\nYou just have to find something that suits your own personal needs.  I am an academic (social sciences), I would certainly recommend it - it is fairly flexible, I can work from home quite easily if I am having a bad day, and my job mainly consists of thinking, reading, and writing. I also work with very supportive people, who understand my condition, which I think is a fairly important factor too.  I build, repair, and sell firearms and own a sporting goods store. It works well for hemophilia as mostly I just sit and talk and use small tools.  Do you have any problems (bruising or more soreness the next day) shooting large caliber rifles or 12ga? My son is 6 yr old severe type A. I would be starting him on .22 but would like to know for the future.  I own a 375 h&amp;h I shoot once a year. Always gives me a bleed but it is worth it. I stick with guns that have recoil reduction like my scar 17s, AR platform rifles, and mid range calibers for handguns to prevent bruising. I do shoot large caliber bolt action guns but only standing to reduce the stress on my shoulder. With skeet and trap I use a 12 gauge and have no bleeds, done that for years but occasionally bruise if I shoot magnum buck shot or slugs. Good to know. It has always been on my mind. Thank you.  Of course. Feel free to pm if you have any other questions.  Good to hear your experience with trapshooting.  It has become very popular in high schools in my state.  I have been talking it up to my patients.   I started when I was 12 with a Mossberg 500 12 gauge and have not stopped!  Interesting. \n\nWhat is the special chair?  What purpose does it serve? I have only been shooting once fwiw, but I fired a 12ga and an akm without any bruising or soreness the next day. I would agree with the other opinions stated regarding that there is no ideal career for a general hemophiliac. You need to find one that fits your specific strengths and interests. I would say that you would want to stay away from heavily physical jobs. Anything where having bleeds is going to prevent you from completing your main job responsibilities.\n\nAssuming you are in the US I would also pay close attention to what types of insurance benefits your future employers might offer you. Other things to think about depending on your chosen career field are the ability to work from home periodically. This can be helpful when you are having leg bleeds, etc.\n\nPersonally I work in the IT field and its worked out well for me. I have been with the same employer for over 10 years and they have been flexible with me the few times I had bleeding issues or had dr appointments. I am kind of late to the party here but I might be able to offer some insight into shooting with Hemophilia.  I grew up with a single parent (father) who was an avid outdoorsman so my weekends were spent shooting, hunting, archery, fishing etc... but we always shot guns.  We lived out in the sticks so the back yard was an open firing range.  I did not have any issues with bleeds from shooting, and I do not even remember any bruising from a .22.  Of course everybody is different but if he is strong enough to shoulder and fire a .22 rifle I would say let him have at it.  It is good to teach him not only the safety aspect of guns but to help him form good habits like keeping the butt plate tight to the shoulder and how to use the sights and scope to help him minimize potentially painful mistakes with larger calibers later.  I am 40 now and my entire adult life I have had occasions after shooting when my shoulder was bruised. Mostly because I spent a long day at the range shooting hundreds and hundreds of rounds.  Not painful, debilitating damage but a little black and blue mark I notice in the mirror.  Personally I have not had that happen with .223 or smaller.  I usually do not leave a mark unless I have been shooting 7.62X39 or larger.  The 30 caliber rounds only get me if I spend hours blasting away and I am sure a butt stock cushion would offer some relief but I have never bothered with them.  Anyway, that is a lot of typing to say yes, let him shoot. As long as he is strong enough to handle the caliber, let him shoot it.  On a side note, I got into archery in my early teens and I think it helped me with strength and flexibility by drawing the bow.  Anything that encourages strength and flexibility is a good thing for us.  Especially as we get older.  I.hope this helps you overcome any aprehension you have about your son shooting.  And FWIW I am a severe type A.  Happy shooting. \n Basing this on ideal career focus, hemophilia patients need to have coverage for insurance, really good job insurance that is. \n\nA personal preference of mine is to be able to sit and work for long periods of time with little run around. \n\nI am studying for legal assistant into paralegal with minor in accounting. \n\nPreferable jobs would be in County, State or federal jobs. They offer benefits that out play most available insurances. I personally would take the pay difference to get the better insurance. But I have Type A sever so I may be more biased than others. \n\nOther Jobs that offer exemplary benefits would be what you should direct yourself towards IMO. Places like hospitals, or for medical administration. \n\nAgain this is an opinion not a \"do this or you are failing.\" I work as clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, researcher and going to study forensic and investigative psychology.

This will be interesting! Hemlibra has been a blessing! Definitely interested in this topic though. It is not curing anyone yet, but early trials from certain companies show an increased production of the clotting factor. So less bleeds in a year.  I am severe A. Baseline f8 .4%. Was on profie doses every 4 days. Averaged 30-40 doses a year. Started gene therapy 3 years ago and have only taken 6 doses. Five of them have been in the past year as the therapy seems to wear off. My clotting factor has been as high as 150%, about 6 mos. after initial dose. It came down and stayed in 50-80% range for approx 18 months. Now has dropped to 9% (as of 6/28/21). Which is still high compared to my baseline. The infusions were due to trauma. I fell twice, stepped in a hole while walking the dog.

Have you heard any theories for why your FVIII activity level is dropping? So you are enrolled in a clinical trial?  Which one? Sorry, I work at a testing site.  I cannot really say which one.  But I can say that the results seems to be really good at first, then slowly taper off (factor levels) over a few years.  We are not sure yet if it will taper off completely to zero or hang around in the 10-20 range indefinitely.  With the expected high cost, the longevity is very important of course.  We are in year 3 now with several patients at several initial dosage amounts. From what I understand the \"virus vectors\" what they injected, I call them nanobots. Have a limited lifetime, they were to jump start my liver to produce F8 like it should. The hope was that my liver would continue producing at a higher level w/o help from the nanobots. Unfortunately it looks like as they kick the bucket my liver is returning to a pre nanobot state. I hope they will give another dose after this one is done. Its been nice not having to infuse all the time.\nHoping this may turn into a cure so my grandson does not have to continue to infuse. Is this a test for Factor VIII or Factor IX? I am currently 65 years old and participated in one of the Spark studies. My Factor VIII levels have \"leveled out\" between 20-30%. The last testing 6 weeks ago was at 29%. I had the therapy over two years ago and the leveling out occurred 2 months after the therapy. My levels do fluctuate but I have not had a single bleeding episode since receiving the therapy. I was using Factor VIII on demand before the therapy and was transfusing about every 2 weeks. It is sad to hear that other people had a drop off in their FVIII levels. I would be interested in knowing which therapy they used. I was one of 5 people receiving a newer vector  and I have been told that every other person had immune responses that significantly dropped their FVIII levels.

However, I am having trouble finding a job that would cover my meds. I am lucky enough to be a Mild type A, but I do not know of any jobs that would cover meds so expensive. Am I just going to have to find something that cover most of it then I will have to just eat the rest of the bill? This has never been an issue before, because my father is in the army and TriCare has paid for it all. I do not know of another job that has benefits like that. Thank you so much for the help in advance. It can vary depending on your needs (prescription costs verses ded/co). Some employers will post their benefits or you can find it by searching online but that can be rare. Unfortunately, most benefits are revealed after your hired, including any waiting periods before you can join those benefits.\n\nMy experience has been that bigger employers (including state and federal jobs) have a larger pool therefore better benefits but that is not a guarantee and may vary on where you live. \n\nI am not sure how the market place (healthcare.gov) benefits pay if you need to get your own coverage. But from my understanding, those benefits do not usually cross state lines and you can only enroll during open enrollment (roughly November) unless you have a qualifying event. However it is an option if you want to take a career path that does not involve a large corporation.\n\n(This is assuming you live in US and this is just my personal experience).\n\nIf you have any employed friends, you can always ask them but most people do not actually understand their benefits so it may be better to see the actual health insurance pamphlet they were provided last.\n\nI do recommend when looking at benefits, do not shy away just because you see a high deductible plan. Sometimes employers offer HSAs which they may deposit money into and your premiums can be much lower. Hsa deposits and premium payments are deducted before tax so that can also be beneficial and roll over every year unlike most FSA accounts.\n\nif you are looking for a future career, Healthcare is a complicated beast and I would not choose a career path based on benefits today because honestly, they keep changing every year.  But I understand your concern because I was the same when I was younger and had to find coverage for a different medical issue right out of college (before coverage under parents was extended to 26). I actually ended up working for a health insurance company and learned a ton which has helped immensely since my surprise hemophiliac was born. I would say look for a career path in high demand which gives you more negotiation power but that changes so much that when you finish your education/training, you might find that market flooded with competition. Safer to stick with what you are good at and interested in. I agree. Healthcare is such an active topic in the USA that the situation could be completely different by the time you are in your career. I have very strong political views on this topic, and you should too, since you have an expensive, preexisting medical condition\u2014this is something we cannot ignore or be apathetic about\u2014but there is no way to predict what difference your choice of career will make so make that decision for better reasons. \n\nObviously, if you are looking for a job right this instant, rather than a career, yeah, bigger companies and higher paying jobs are going to be better, and health care for freelancers, retailers, artists, is hard whether you have hemophilia or not. One optimistic idea is to check whether your drug company has an assistance plan. Mine covers anything my insurance does not (so I do not have to pay the co pay) and no income proof was required. What country are you located in? USA Any job that provides benefits should do the trick. I am a software developer now but a few years back I was working customer service and I was able to get my meds completely free. What medication do you take? I am on Xyntha and I treat as needed. Pfizer makes the drug and they offer a copay assistance program. Most factor producers have a program like this and they will pay your full copay, rendering the medication completely free.

I know that there are not any published articles that covers this.\n\nHowever, I read somewhere that taking fishoil supplements may cause bleedings even in people without hemophilia.\n\nDo we know anything related to hemophilia and taking omega 3-6-7-9 supplements? I never heard of this fish oil treatment. Interesting I have been told to stay away from fish oil. Cannot exactly remember why but something to do with it sometimes acting like a thinner? Me too. Told to avoid Omega 3. I used to take a ton. I use collagen peptides I had to stop taking fish oil after having a couple of bleeds in a short period of time. I have got mild-moderate hemophilia A so it was out of the ordinary to have a series of bleeds like that. Once I stopped taking the fish oil, the bleeds stopped.\n\nI ate (and still eat) a lot of oily fish and have not noticed any bleeding issues from that. Do you track your bleeds? Have you seen any correlation between when you have been taking fish oil and bleeding episodes? If it helps your joints without causing more bleeding than usual, there is no reason not to take it. No. I am on Jivi 4000 units twice a week. I only have major improvements in my ankles and knees. I was just curious if these supplements could give me bleedings or even worse micro bleedings. Try it for two weeks (everyday) remember to get 3-6-7-9. I tried before with regular omega 3-6 but had only minor improvements Do you feel any improvements? Any side effects? But this does not make sence? Then we should avoid eating fish? avocado and other omega fatty food? The supplements could increase bleeding risk by themselves, but if you are doing prophylaxis that is going to more than balance out any anticoagulant effects of the fish oil.\n\nI do not have any studies at hand, but I recall omega-3 fatty acids having general anti-inflammatory effects, so it would make sense that they would help with arthritis pain. I think this is advised if your factor levels are low. But it should not matter if you are on Hemlibra or doing prophylactic infusions. I also dont think omegas are going to hurt more than they might help in some cases, even with a low factor level. I know too much vitamin E can cause nose bleeds, maybe it is something similar. But if you are raising your factor level then you should be fine. I have been told that the risks outweigh the potential benefits of supplements, although dietary intake is fine (same with turmeric). The best thing I have had for joints is a workout routine my physical therapist developed for me along with some k-tape every now and then - I know some claims of what k-tape can do are not really proven but sometimes it is just having the tactile sensation in that area that is helpful. Interesting! I just started taking fish oil today, what a coincidence haha. I was told those are fine just to avoid taking super concentrated Omega 3\u2019s on a regular basis. I have severe hem b.\n\nI have not taken fish oil for a couple of months but I have used it since I was a child and it really helped me joints feel supple. I am 32 now. \n\nI am experimenting with collagen now and it seems to be going well. I switched because of my concerns over quality of mid to low end fish oil products. What kind of collagen? I would like to try to.\nPills or like protein source? Can you send me an example? Thanks! I use collagen in pill form. I use Revive Multi Collagen capsules! Just ordered some, thx! Do you feel any improvements? My skin has definitely improved, it looks more dewy. And my joints feel good so I would say so. I tend to take two capsules first thing in the morning with water.

No one to share my experiences with, no one to laugh with about disgustingly big bruises, no one to pick up factor with at the hospital. This should have been my brother. He passed away when I was young, about 4 years old. I have very faint memories of him, he was also a hemophiliac, Severe A. He died from AIDS during the tainted blood crisis.

But now I am older, and now I feel like grieving my brothers death. I have accepted that I am a hemophiliac and it hurts even more to know that life might have been a bit easier if I had a big brother to help me along the way.

I have casually followed the emergence of clinical trials for gene therapy over the past year or so, but have not made the leap to actually sign up for one. Today, my hematologist suggested that I sign up for The ALTA clinical study for SB-525 by Sagramo for Hemophilia A. I did the screening and am a good candidate, but I am still skeptical, and frankly a little uncomfortable, with the thought of unknown long term consequences. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight or words of wisdom that can help me make an informed decision on what is best for me\u2014 or know of a good resource for my own research? I know several members of this sub have participated in trials, and I am very interested in hearing your thoughts, positive or negative. \n\nA little bit about me: I am in my mid-twenties with Severe Hemophilia A and have no target joints or muscles. I have no inhibitors and I live a very active lifestyle.  It sounds like you must be pretty good about prophy if you are active and have no target joints. So you probably have a good routine and everything is well controlled. Which is awesome. So you may feel like there is not a huge personal need to jump into a study.\n\nThough, I would say that even though long\\-term complications *could* be a result of gene therapy, the same could be said of continuing to live w/ hemophilia. You never know if an injury would sideline you, or whether you ever run into issues getting FVIII due to insurance, lack of availability, or inhibitors, or the risks associated with any surgeries or dental work you might need down the road, etc etc etc.\n\nSo as cliche as it sounds, I guess I would make a list of pros and cons.\n\nI am not familiar with this specific study, but its method of action seems very similar to studies like BMN 270 and SPK 8011. Though there is no long term data for these studies, the short term data looks very promising. I would review the published data for these two studies and see if you have the same reservations. The worst side effect seems to be some having to be on steroids to keep the liver from producing enzymes that would inactivate the vector.\n\nI did a gene therapy study back in the 90's and was considering enrolling into one again. My experience was overwhelmingly positive. Regardless of whether I got any personal benefit, advancing science is kind of cool. It can be intrusive and annoying with the amount of visits and tests that happen over the course of the study, but the payoff can be amazing. And if it works, you got a potential cure for free. I am in the Spark SPK\\-9001 trial for Factor IX gene therapy.  I was infused with the vector about 18 months ago.  Since then my FIX activity level has gone from between 1 and 2 percent to, at last check in March, 38&amp;#37;.  I did not have an immune system response to the vector, so I did not have to take steroids at any time.  I have not had any bleeds, so I have not had to treat.  I did infuse one prophy dose as a precaution prior to undergoing an unrelated endoscopy procedure about six months into the study.  I have had no indications of an inhibitor.\n\nSo basically everything went about as well as could be expected for me. 10/10 would do again.\n\nHere is the trial I think you are talking about:  (\n\nHere is the most recent press release I could find about it:  (\n\nFrom what I can tell, they have not published any results so far.\n\nI was very lucky when deciding on whether to participate in my study.  There were several brave people who went before I did and their results were published.  While it was still a small number of people, I knew that things were mostly going well.  In your situation with the Sangamo trial, I would ask them to share the results they have so far.  And, as u/pixeltip said, compare Sangamo's results to the published results so far from the Biomarin and Spark FVIII gene therapy trials.\n\nThe Sangamo trial is trying to determine the best dose of the vector to use.  It is possible that early participants could receive a dose that is too low to raise their factor activity level a significant amount.   The folks in my trial consider 12&amp;#37; the level at which the risk of spontaneous bleeds is zero or close to it.   And while every percent over what you have now is helpful, if you end up with too low a dose they cannot just give you a second, higher dose because you will have developed neutralizing antibodies to the vector.\n\nI would recommend meeting or calling the doctor running the trial location you are considering.  In my experience they are more than happy to talk about the trial and answer questions.  See if they will send you the Informed Consent document so you can get more details about what happens in the trial.  Heck, maybe even contact the doctors from the Biomarin or Spark trials and talk to them.  \n\nIf you have specific questions, let me know.  I feel like I have a bunch of gene therapy factoids bouncing around in my head but no orderly way to present them. I am halfway considering doing it myself. One of my main reasons is that I do not know if my insurance would cover a cure in the future. \n\nI personally have been having issues keeping up with prophy due to anxiety, though. Pharmacy keeps sending low-quality butterflies that tend to move and flip. \n\nIf you are not having any issues with hemophilia, you should just ask yourself if it is going to be worth the risk.

Hey everyone! I work for a specialty pharma company on their innovation team and I have been tasked with figuring out what problems patients have with specialty pharma and how I can use technology to help fix it. Since hemophiliacs make up a large part of our patients I figured asking the hemophilia community what problems they have would be a good place to start. So please if you are interested in helping me gain some insight, leave your biggest complaint about specialty pharmacy below. Thanks! Whilst it is great to see a pharma company interested in consulting people with hemophilia, some more transparency would be nice. Is there a way to reward people with hemophilia for their expertise and time in helping with this consultation? Does this kind of project align with ( Is this a form of research? If so, has it been ethically reviewed? \n\nI do not want to come across as harsh, it is honestly really refreshing to be asked for input, rather than handed a product/gimmick that does not work! However, given the $$$ that pharmaceutical companies make off of hemophilia, it would be nice to be involved more formally and acknowledged, rather than have our lived experience and knowledge appropriated and sold back to us!

And how has it been going?  \n\n\nI inquired about the new meds a couple months ago. Last week my hematologist contacted me about going on it. She wants me to call in January to schedule an appointment on how to mix it, inject it, etc. She sent me a booklet about it. Shows how to mix it up and whatnot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose that are on it, there any vast improvement over just taking your meds regularly? Currently I try to take my F8 twice a week, but I do skip a day here and there. Helimbra I would be taking it once a week for the 1st month then once every two weeks. So that is a plus I guess. I was hoping it would just be a shot ready to go, like an epipen or Humira. So I still have to mix it up just like my F8. No real different there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, how has your experiences with it been? I have been on Hemlibra since the beginning of November (no inhibitor). So far so good!\n\nI was on weekly Eloctate treatments for a year. Switched over to this weekly. The first 4 weeks you take a double dose (which for me required 2 pokes each week) but now I am into my normal dosing that I just started this past week which is only one.\n\nThe first 4 week went fairly well. On Eloctate I think I had 2 breakout bleeds in my target elbow joint, both during last winter. On Hemlibra I had one last week when it got extremely cold and I shoveled (I usually do not shovel due to Hemophilia as it always caused bleeds). The breakout bleed went away on its own the following day. Really never got bad which was weird since my elbow usually gets bad kind of quickly. It also has helped tremendously with my elbow over the past month. Less aching due to it helping with inflammation.\n\nThis all being said, I did not go completely unscathed from Hemlibra for the first 2 weeks. I did get all of the smaller symptoms. The red skin discoloration on the injection sight, the aching joints and slight dizziness (probably from my blood pressure going up and dropping though since I have never poked a needle in myself before).\n\nNone of those have returned since my 2nd week though apart from very slight red skin for about 20 minutes at the injection spot. But it is less and less each week as my body adjusts.\n\nThe mixing is super easy. Literally just put a bit of air into the vial, put it into the syringe and inject. It is not like traditional Factor VIII medications where you have to swap some of it to another vial. It is also a very small amount. My double dose was 1.8ML and I am at 0.88ML now each dose. Before it was 2 syringes and now it is just the one. We are going to evaluate how I do on my current dose for a month and see if I should switch to once every 2 weeks or maybe even once per month. But for now I am okay with once per week. Far easier than going to the Infusion Center once a week to get multiple IVs poked in order to hit my scarred veins!\n\nOverall, this has been a great experience. I hope in the long term it continues to work like this, at least until gene therapy becomes a more readily available thing. \n\nHope it works out for you! It is definitely a life changer. Still sort of surreal that we finally got to this point! There is a big push in Canada to write to your provincial health ministers to get Hemlibra distributed in Canada. So much politics holding it up here with supply chain  21 months now, total game-changer.\n\n&gt;So I still have to mix it up just like my F8\n\nNo? I get mine pre-constituted, ready to go.\n\nYou may be interested in *every other hemlibra thread we have had*:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ah. I have watched a video of it and it makes sense now. Hematologist told me about loading a syringe up with a vial; I thought that meant I had to mix up the vial like I do now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny my bad on the other discussions. I never use Reddit. Only reason I am here is for the Hemophilia discussions. Yep - they cannot do preloaded syringes because the dosage is based on weight. I currently get weighed every 12 weeks or so and they re-adjust my dose.\n\nI am not quite sure what my dosing schedule will be like once the trial officially ends (it is not approved for non-inhib use in Japan yet but it is coming), but I was more or less told that if I wanted to take it every two weeks I could... with a double dose (so ~1.6ml), which is still two syringes and two shots. Guessing it is going to vary from doctor to doctor. I have been on it since the beginning of November. Been throwing a 20 and 25 pound weight in the air almost every day occasionally, along with bicep curls. I have felt some arm/chest muscle sensations and have not gotten a bleed. This is when every time I shove them up in the air, I hear my right elbow crackle and pop. That normally meant an automatic bleed, but I have not had one. I have vaguely playing it safe, but kind of not. If I did all this normally, I *would* have had multiple bleeds since then and it would have screwed up my RoM even more. \n\nHonestly, I have never felt a stronger persistent desire to workout in my life aside from maybe when I was in 7-8th grade when I wanted to get some muscles for high school. Of course, that resulted in me having to stop over and over again because of those random bleeds that threw me into painful depression over it, except the depression was so automatic that I would never even realize it. I was so used to pain that it felt like just having a cold, except it was debilitating as far as the limitations it put on me for that natural antidepressant of exercise. \n\nOver all, all I have felt after using my bad right elbow a bunch has been a general tense sensation, similar to a bleed, except without the feeling of warmth or puffiness. Just a kind of slight pain. From what I have heard from others, that is kind of all that usually happens. I heard one guy who was on it for a year and a half ended up getting one bleed while helping his friend move furniture or something. I really hope it was from dropped something on a foot or something, because that is sensible. If it is just from joint tension, that is a little upsetting, but I have not had any problem with bleeds yet.\n\nIt is not a cure, but it is as close to one as I can imagine, and the injection is also incredibly simple. You just pull out the right amount with the transfer needle, swap that for the injection one, pinch your belly meat on the side, poke it in, then release the pinched skin and inject it. Simple af compared to all the nonsense required for a dose of factor. I have been on it for 5 weeks now, just got it on the lowered dose, it is going well so far not had any problems, a lot better than the high doses of the treatment I was getting before regularly because of my inhibitor, has opened up a lot of free time in my week and I do not feel like Hemophilia is such a drag on my days anymore with not having to spend the better part of 2 hours just doing medication. Just hope it continues to do well for me last Friday was my 13th week dose of hemlibra.  Not a single spontaneous bleed in this period. 2 trauma bleeds got cured in one night. \n\nAnd  it was very helpful for student like me in country like India   Hi, thanks for sharing this.

Although acetaminophen does not reduce swelling, it is safer than other medicines.

Acetaminophen does not have these side effects. \n\nMedicines that people with hemophilia should **not** take include the following:\n\n* Aspirin\n* Ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin\n* Medicines that contain salicylate. This ingredient is closely related to aspirin. Alka-Seltzer, Pepto-Bismol, and many cough medicines contain salicylates.\n* Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, such as Aleve. These medicines are designed to reduce swelling and reduce pain. you know your body best though, I have a severe hemophiliac friend who takes aleve for his joint pain and he is been okay. I know a lot of folks with bleeding disorders that take celebrex for long term joint pain as well!\n\nI personally avoid acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) because I have vWD type 3 and we tend to bleed more into the mucosal membrane than hemophiliacs. Ibuprofen and related products (advil, excedrin, motrin, etc) have a risk of GI bleeds and a general anti-clotting tendency. Even non-hemophilia patients are told to not take NSAIDS after surgery. I would look into a new doc/hematologist... I am severe. 200mgs is nothing. My severe brother takes celebrex, which is also an NSAID. It is not as bad as Asprin imo. I Take it for fevers and headaches in a pinch. It is probably counterproductive for bleeds.  After a nurse almost pumped me full of ibuprofen, I asked my doctor if he could put in ibuprofen and Advil as allergies, and that has seemed to solve a lot of problems there.", "Daughter has VWD, is Zoloft safe? My daughter was diagnosed with VWD last year. She has a hormonal IUD to control heavy periods, a script for  Tranexamic acid (that we have not had to use since the IUD),  and  Stimate for any incidents that may occur. \n\nRecently she was put on Zoloft for depression and anxiety. Her pedi put her on it and knows her history so I did not think anything of it. She is been on it a month and they raised it to 50 mg a few days ago. \n\nToday while looking at the copay card for Zoloft I noticed it had a note about \"If you have had bleeding problems talk to your doctor before taking Zoloft.\"  Is this a concern for VWD? Does anyone know the risks?\n\nIt could be a coincidence but she also happens to have some bruises on her legs that she does not recall getting which I would not be worried about until I read this. It is not uncommon for her to have bruising because she is an active yet clumsy  teen and you add that with VWD, quite a lot of bruises. \n\nI sent a email off to both her pedi and her hematologist but that might take a couple of days to get a response. Many of these drugs affect platelets.  Have your hematologist and pediatrician discuss this.  Do not stop taking this without your daughter\u2019s doctors instruction. I have mild vwd and take Zoloft. Have been on it for years. Went to my yearly blood clinic a few times since being on it and they have not said anything. My internist used to be a hematologist and he is also fine with it. Call your pharmacist and they should be able to explain why that warning is on the medication. That makes me feel a lot better. I will call t pharmacist and ask them, too. Thanks for the advice. I msged them on the online chart and will not stop the drug unless they advise to. Good luck", "Can we drive a car? Mild A here. Is it possible for us to drive the car? Since driving will involve a lot of foot power. ", "Vitamin E foods? Good or silly idea? I am a moderately severe hemophilia A and I have been avoiding vitamin E fastidiously ever since I learnt it could cause bleeding. \n\nHowever, I have also been stricken with this recurrent perianal abscess that just keeps coming back after about an operation every year for the last decade. \n\nIs it a good idea to eat vitamin E foods for a hemophiliac? You should really talk with your doctor. A lot things like this pop up online as fads and trends, and it is really hard to know what is based in reality. Wikipedia (not the best source but the quickest) does say vitamin E can have some pretty adverse effects for a generally healthy person. I would hate to see you develop other symptoms while trying to help ease the bleeding. Please go talk to your doctor and get their opinion on the potential risks and benefits. I am trying to get an appointment with him even as we speak. A vitamin E deficiency causing this whole recurring abscess saga would make sense. \n\nDo you take any food with vitamin E?  Sorry, I do not think I was being super clear. Taking vitamin E in excess when you do not need to may have adverse side effects. Again, that is just from a quick google search so it may not be entirely accurate. You should be careful though, alt health fads can be really dangerous. You should really be approved by your doctor before changing anything in your medication even if it seems harmless like an increase in a certain vitamin or protein. ", "BioMarin Submits Biologics License Application to U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec to Treat Hemophilia A | 23DEC19 ", "What do you guys do to exercise? My knees and ankles are pretty much shot. I need to do something about this extra weight I am carrying but I do not want to aggravate anything. Swimming and generally exercising/stretching in the water. Also try crunches and sit-ups if you are talking about some extra belly fat you would like to get rid of. You do not need your ankles for that. I would second swimming. I ride a stationary bike a lot.... Sometimes it makes my knees mad but I like the aerobic exercise it provides. I suspect you know this, but just in case: There is no such thing as 'spot reduction' -- exercising your abs does not help you lose weight around your stomach. You have to lose weight overall.\n\nThat said, swimming is a good recommendation. I do not have joint problems so it is not going to be super helpful, but I lift weights (squats, deadlift, bench and overhead press, pullups) and run on an elliptical machine (for cardio). Thank you. I had a feeling swimming would be the consensus. I swam competitively for 10 years. It definitely helped me stay active while helping my joints at the same time. In no way is the below medical advice but below is what I did when I wanted to drop some weight and improve health. \n\nI would say this is a tough situation but understand as I have terrible elbows. It is not going to be easy however starting slow, especially with any weights is really important. Start with the lighter weights if you plan on attempting it. Always factor up before-hand. It would be great if you can have a trainer help you with learning and starting on any equipment you do not know how to use. Many gyms provide this for free at least once at the start of your membership. \n\nMany others have chimed in here about swimming which I agree with. Swimming is really easy on the joints but also allows you to gain muscle while also burning calories to maintain/burn weight. \n\nThe biggest difference I saw when losing weight is improving your diet and focusing on portions. Try to see where you can improve your diet and how you can portion out your meals. Try to get help from the numerous fitness and diet subreddits here and I am sure you will be well on your way to improving everything overall :)\n\nCheers and I hope this helps!! I did not know that, but thank you! Just a side note, I am a 23 y/o male from Montreal. \ud83d\udc4c Swim. And bike and walk a lot. Weight lifting is good too if you can move up slowly enough. As long as you are covered with factor or whatever you should be ok I swam as well. It is extremely effective. Elliptical and very very careful yoga \nI wish I had access to a pool for swimming laps Same, except I have a fused ankle and right elbow issues. It is all about knowing your limits and what lifts work for you. I would not recommend any isolation lifts, anything that puts way too much stress on joints for movements that you would not ever do in a regular day. The ones mentioned above are great. Take it slow though, less weight more reps in the beginning and slowly build your way up. I am devoting some time in 2020 to exploring yoga further.  Over the summer I had the opportunity to try more low impact forms of yoga that involved holding poses for longer rather than getting into a 'flow\" and I found great benefit from this type of practice.  It would be my hope to work with some teachers to make them aware of our joint degradation plights as and form a kind of consensus routine that we could use for exercise and recovery from bleeds. Yoga, rowing, anything aquatic, and cycling have been my go to\u2019s for a long time. Healthy balance is key When it comes to diet, has anyone tried keto? I have. It is a very easy diet for me to stick to because of the rules you need to follow, and because I know a lot of the science behind it. On other diets, it was easy to rationalize a small cheat, but something like a candy bar could throw me out of ketosis for 2-3 days.\n\nIt is also great for me because fat keeps you feeling fuller. No more feeling hungry like a half hour after eating.\n\nOnce you get in to it, you could try Intermittent Fasting. I eat one big Keto meal a day and some vitamins, and fast for 23 hours on the weekdays. Surprisingly easy to get in to, and can be done non-Keto too. Less extreme fasting methods include eating all your meals in an 8hr window, so your body is fasting for 16hrs. Qi Gong is also great. It is more like body-meditation than exercise, with slow precise movements. It is a meditative martial art, like Tai Chi but with lower impact. Just anything to get you moving will help. Do not want to do more damage by jumping in to too much. I do what machines at the gym I can, making sure to get a little of everything. Sometimes this means only doing the machine with one arm/leg since I have elbow and ankle problems on different sides.\n\nI am not good at stretching at the gym, so just getting moving helps me. I do my stretching at home with video guides to motivate me. Swimming did not work for me as it led to more bleeds. Finding a good pair of shoes and walking while on prophylaxis did. It is all about trying to eat better. Exercise alone will not get you far. Oatmeal, buckwheat etc in the morning on a regular basis. My knees are really bad, but luckily enough I can move around with a bicycle and have a indoor bike on hand as well. I dunno if you can manage something like that with shotty ankles tho. In any case, thanks to the MyFitnessPal app I managed to lose about 10 kg's (at 178 cm I was pushing 90 kg and started to have trouble tying my shoelaces). Smoking and drinking did not help much either, but I managed to cut down on that as well. We should make a proper support group for something like this. Trying to live healthier lives and whatnot. Log splitters, chainsaws, tractors, grapples, and other heavy equipment. \n\nHeating with wood keeps me in check for sure. No, but pretty much all the science points to it being bad for you. You need carbs for energy. My username gives it away a bit, but rowing. It is a great low-impact , full-body exercise, and the mental benefits of being part of a team and out in nature (on the  river or lake) are fantastic, too.\n\nProblem is, it can be pretty expensive, and you need to be near a large body of water. While indoor rowing has the physical benefits, it is also often the most boring part of the sport.\n\nIf any other bleeders in/near London (UK) want to give it a try, hit me up. My wife and I sold the car a decade ago and now get around via bike and transit. I am older and had a ton of knee damage from bad treatment protocols when I was young 1970s. When I eventually had to get my knees replaced, the fact that I had been a cyclist for most of my travel meant my muscles were still strong. PT was a breeze, now I can hike 8 miles!", "Long wait time for appointment with hematologist Just a rant post. It is been a hot minute since I have been seen at a Hemophilia Treatment Center. I am in my early 30s and never actually been seen as an adult, which I realize is bad. But I am getting my shit together and finally reached out to the adult HTC in my area. I am told the first available appointment is 4 months away. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Wtf. I guess I am lucky my symptoms are manageable... for now. Glad to hear you are getting back on track with those. 4 months is a very long time to wait.. If you do not mind me asking, where abouts? Also, be sure to get emergency contacts in case a doctor has to speak to a hematologist in case of an emergency. Not sure if its common but in Seattle, you can call the center and get assistance especially when it comes to convincing the triage nurse that your injury could be life threatening. That is a good pointer re emergency contacts. Thanks.\n\nI am in Dallas and the adult center is here as well. I am told there are only a limited number of spots for new patients to be seen, which I get, but this seems excessive. it can be hard.  especially if there are not any other treatment centers in the vicinity At my HTC, \"clinic\" is only run one day a week, and each patient is typically there for at least 3 hours cycling through the various components, so there is really only a few patients they can see in a given week. The previous HTC I went to had a similar schedule, so if yours is anything like that, you could see how it might be 4 months before there is an opening. Yea, hemophilia treatment centers are terribly underfunded. No on is happy about this. Most of us learn to take our health into our own hands. That being said, is there anything we can do to help? I mean, most of what we deal with is a judgement call, or can be solved through an advocate. There is not a whole lot that a hematologist knows that a severe hemophiliac in his 40\u2019s cannot tell you how to treat. So what is up? Try me. I have always had issues with my HTC. They pop up and close down randomly around here. My current one is ok, but he did try to talk me out of Hemlibra saying that it would not work and wanted to go to 3 times a week prophylaxis. I had already gotten the loading doses of Hemlibra from his old assistant so I got to go ahead and try it. I feel better now than I ever have. No amount of factor ever did what one dose of Hemlibra did. I actually look forward to my treatments now. My doctor is a straight up asshole so I cant wait to rub that in a little on our next visit. Rub it in a lot.  Also ask him if he is making the same stupid recommendation to other patients. I appreciate the offer! I do not have many issues day to day. Plus, as far as I know there is nothing I can do to self-treat aside from avoiding blood thinners and injuries (but I would love to be told I am wrong on that!). So really I just need to get seen so I can work with a hematologist on a pre-op plan for a surgery I may have coming up, which will likely just involve them signing off on FFP. That is probably pretty standard from what I have experienced.  The HTCs I have used across several states have a \"clinic\" scheduled every so often and how often depends on the hemophiliac population they have treat.  I have also noticed they tend to schedule by age.  So the \"adult clinic\" at your HTC might be first quarter.  Unless there is an emergency, they are probably trying to fit you into their system.  Once you are in, they will see you annually as long as you do not have any unexpected problems.  Of course these assumptions are based on my experiences.", "Dimension Therapeutics Announces FDA Fast Track Designation for Lead Candidate DTX101 in Patients with Hemophilia B ", "Tattoo on Hemlibra vs Elocta Hello my blood friends! (Severe A here)\n\nI have a question regards getting tattoo on Hemlibra! \n\nI got 3 tattoos (one is pretty big and everything was great) when I was on Elocta. Now I am on Hemlibra and I was wondering what is the different? I was talking with my nurse and she simply do not know the answer to it yet because it is so new. What she did told me that on normal facto my factor lvl would go to around 50% and on Hemlibra is around 15%. I was wondering if that is going to be a problem?\n\nAnyone here with a tattoo using both Elocta and then Hemlibra?\n\nGetting a shot of Elocta is not really an option because it is not for medical purpose.\n\nThanks everyone! I think once you get the tattoo it will then become a medical reason. You might as well make something up because I think you are going to want to infuse. Hemlibra will keep you from most spontaneous bleeds, but it will not completely stop bleeds from injury. A tattoo is more of an injury, would not you say? I had a blood blister on my tongue pop the other day and it bled like a fountain until I did an infusion of factor, then it stopped immediately. I am severe A and on Hemlibra. I imagine a tattoo will be a similar situation. But I could be wrong? Maybe start slow and see how it goes? I do not want to say that you are wrong because I am also not 100% sure and that is why I am asking but people do not really realise that tattoo needle is not really go deep into our body. Of course it needs to go deep enough to put ink but it is just a little bit and normally there is no blood at all. So it is really not super \"bloody surgery\". But still like I said I am not exactly 100% if just Hemlibra on its own will be enough. What I can say for sure that when I cut myself during cooking sometimes it heals much better on Hemlibra on it is own than Elocta. I do not think you will be in danger or anything if you try it. It is just that if it starts to swell up or not stop bleeding as much as you would like you might want to do a shot then.\nI also seem to have low von Willebrand\u2018s factor. So I use factor eight that has von Willebrand\u2019s in it as well. That might be why hemlibra does not completely do it for me. I am not completely sure of this I am still waiting to get my von Willebrand\u2019s factor level back. I guess my point is that everyone is different and it is not such a simple answer. I have most of my upper arm done. Just did a session last Friday in fact. I will infuse eloctate the morning of the tattoo - after that I just let the hemlibra do its thing. Even when I was only on eloctate I would only infuse day of and let it go after, I always thought it kept the colors in better - but that could be bullshit so take it with a grain of salt. Do you think hemlibra on its own is not enough?", "Pain Management Hello fellow hemophiliacs,\n\nI thought that I would create this thread so that people can share their tips for managing pain.  It can be a little bit difficult as a hemophiliac since 90% of OTC painkillers are NSAIDs and thus, generally, a no-no for hemophiliacs.\n\nHere are my tips:\n\n1.  Tylenol.\n2.  Ice.\n3.  If it is a soft tissue bleed (muscle, etc), then move it.  I cannot speak to joint bleeds since I really do not have them.\n\nWhat are your tips?\n\n(I am still really, really annoyed that they took Vioxx off the market, why do not they just put a warning label on it?)", "Head Bleed and Concussions Hi i am 17 years old with mild/moderate hemophilia and I really want to play football. Naturally I have a good arm from playing baseball my whole life and want to play quarterback. They obviously do not recommend football at all for people with hemophilia but I really want to play. What happens if i get a bleed in my head or a concussion? Like what are the consequences. Thanks Hi bud. I am sorry but I am going to tell you what you probably do not want to hear, which is you should not play tackle football, full stop. \n\nGuys who do not even have hemophilia sustain lifelong injuries to their knees, back, and head trauma that affects their cognitive abilities the rest of their lives. Very few who play in high school can play in college and even fewer go pro, and if they do they make far less money than other professional athletes. \n\nYou are 17 so you will graduate high school in a year or two depending on if you are older or younger for your grade. It is NOT worth throwing away your lifelong health for a year or two of high school football. Sorry.\n\nIf you have been playing baseball your whole life and you are good and not sustaining injuries, keep with baseball, see if you can get a scholarship from it, and go from there. \n\nIf your reasons for wanting to play football are because of the fun of the game itself, check out other sports and see if there is something similar or that also excites you. If it is for the social aspect, there are definitely other activities you can do for a social outlet. And if it is to be around the popular kids, just junk that because nobody is going to care who you went to high school with in two years anyway.\n\nEdit: adding that for what it is worth, I would never allow my non hemophiliac son to play high school tackle football either, AND when I was in high school I also desperately wanted to play football and had to be told no by my dad. There are certain sacrifices we must make as hemophiliacs. It closes a couple of doors for us but we still have endless possibilities. \nOne moment of fun is not worth a badly damaged joint you will have for your whole life.\n\nConcentrate on the things you can do. The world is wide. There is surely something else that pushes you forward :D The consequences include dying playing football. It is not worth it. Maybe look into trying kicking. I think it is against the rules to hit the kicker, so would lessen the chances of getting tackled head on, though it still does happen all the time...\n\nProbably not worth the risk! \n\nYou could do other things, like get into football refereeing, you would still be involved and make a little bit of coin (plus, nfl refs make a lot of money, something to aspire to). You could ask to be involved in the coaching / managing aspect of it as well if you ask the coaches. There is other, safe ways to get involved!\n\nAnd the consequences of getting a head bleed could be death. My friends father went to sleep with a headache, it was a head bleed and he died. The consequences are significant and severe if something bad were to happen. Not to mention high schoolers can be pretty shitty, when it gets around you have something that you should be treated special to play football. You might get people trying to intentionally or \u201caccidentally\u201d hurt you on the field over it. Were you ever teased on the school yard over hemophila? Those kids are still there looking to get away with hurting someone. I am always one to say this: do not let hemophilia stop you from doing what you love. But there are a few exceptions to this. Tackle football being one of them. Brain damage is too serious of an issue, and all it takes is one brain bleed that goes untreated for a few hours. This is almost sure to happen if you play football. At least to some extent. I hit my head pretty hard once and blacked out for a second, and when I woke up I did an infusion right away and went to the hospital and was admitted and stayed for two weeks to be sure I was ok. I did not suffer any brain damage from what I can tell, but my memory has never been the same. If I had not infused right away I am sure I would have been screwed. It was really scary. People hit their head that hard all the time playing football. \nNot worth it, I promise. I have met too many guys with hemophilia who had small brain bleeds that went un noticed as kids and are mentally impaired now, and completely unable to talk or function normally. It is a really sad thing. It is just not worth the risk, and it is almost certain to happen to some extent. I take a lot of risks myself, but never risks that I know have a definite negative outcome. You can do just about anything with hemophilia if you are careful. But it is impossible to play tackle football and be careful. Same goes for boxing. And being in the jackass crew. There is a short list of things that just are not smart to do if you have a bleeding disorder. It is not too terrible to have to avoid a few things in life. Do not play football, very very very very very bad idea. \n\nIf you play and get hurt, do not say you were not warned I know it is sucks but it is not worth it. I wanted to play rugby but realised it is just not worth it.

It is never been visible, just wondering ? I am not a doctor but in my experience if you have bruising around a swollen joint that just means it was a contact injury that caused it as opposed to most of my bleeds which just pop up from basic usage. Do you remember hitting it on anything? Yeah, that is normal. It is the body essentially processing the blood that was there. The hemoglobin in blood is being broken down and one of the final products is called bilirubin. Bilirubin is yellow, hence the yellow color under the skin.

Reading the posts in this sub have made me feel less alone. Also helped me understand my dad\u2019s debilitating arthritis a lot better (his target is his knees\u2014the one that is not titanium is totally shot.)\n\nI am a 23F carrier. My father (68M) is a hemophiliac (VIII, severe A), his brother/my uncle was too. I am just posting to reach out to anyone who is affected, whether it is you personally, a parent, a child, anyone you are close with in your life. If you ever want to talk, DM me.\n\nMy father is coming home from the hospital on hospice today, he is at the end of an almost year-long battle with liver cancer. Unfortunately, there is nothing left they can really do besides put him on a ventilator (he has a ton of other complications on top of the cancer, which metastasized, bleeds, etc..) and he is choosing to stop all treatments. His liver cancer was the result of Hep C, which he contracted through a blood transfusion or factor sometime in the 80s I would guess. My uncle contracted HIV the same way, he died of AIDS in 1991. Just for context, as I know these things have historically affected this community in a huge way.\n\nThat being said, I thought it would be nice to share with you all something he said, as he has been talking about his hemophilia more at the end of his life. He reflected on the crazy amount of time he spent in the hospital as a child in the 50s and 60s getting transfusions because they could not treat at home. Losing his brother and other people he knew in the community to AIDS. He knows he is got to be one of the older hemophiliacs out there. But despite it all, despite the things he could not do as a bleeder, he feels lucky. He said chronic illness is not something that many spouses can handle well, but my mom has stuck with him for 35 yrs. That a lot of hemophiliacs from his generation did not marry or have children, or live to almost 70\u2013 and he did all of those things. He only sees how fortunate he has been. He has had a lot of wonderful phlebotomists/nurses (he could never stick himself) and we live near a hemophilia clinic and our family has become friendly with many staff members. They have supported him, and us, endlessly. \n\nSo all that being said, I hope you all take care, that medicine keeps improving. I hope that your quality of life is better than my father\u2019s (which he maintains was as good as it could be given the circumstances!) \n\nLike I said before, it has been extremely comforting to me to find this community. The things you all post about are extremely real to me, my anxieties about being a parent one day have finally been validated by other people who.actually.understand. The anecdotes about your target spots even. It is all real. Thank you. I am sorry that you are going through this.  I also have young daughters, and I have little doubt that it will someday be one of them sharing a similar story.  I know you are never really \"old enough\" to lose your parent, I just hope I last long enough that it does not completely destroy them.  But  68 is like 102 in Hemophiliac years, he  must have some interesting stories!  I am so glad he was able to live a \"normal\" life.  IMO hemophiliacs are somewhat pushed to be abnormal, but if you are going to live in a padded room, never have a first kiss, never see your child born, never get an adrenaline rush just from being here, why bother?  Your dad seems to have lived an awesome life, in spite of Hemophilia!  That is something to consider, regarding having children of your own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, your mom is a true saint. One peculiar thing I have noticed when looking family histories of Hemophiliac men is that they tend to never marry or marry someone who loves them eternally.   There are a lot of family trees with 20-30 year life spans on men who is widows lived another 50 years and never remarried.   I love your mom.  It is people like her that make it possible for people like me to even exist and be OK in this world. Hey, I am a teenager with the same type of hemophilia as your dad and maybe it is comforting for you to know that it is way better now. I spend a lot of time in hospitals too but it is never unpleasant. Besides, I have been doing it for so long it is completely normal to me. Apart from the occasional hospital visit and having to jam a needle in my arm twice a week I do not even really think about the fact that I have hemophilia. Best of luck to you and your family. I too am a severe A and member of the \"Tripple H Club\".  Men like your father and uncle have made the lives of all younger hemophiliacs better.  I was diagnosed at the age of 10 with the second and third Hs and the men like your father served as role models for myself and the rest of my age group.  \n\nThose guys showed us how to persevere and truly live.  The struggles guys like your dad dealt with made the lives of the younger generations immeasurably better and still do today.  The hemophilia community in the US is rather tight knit and I am very thankful for all of the friends the community has brought into my life.  \n\nIf you can, thank your dad for me.  I may know him, I may not.  One thing is for sure, most of the strongest, most caring, and bull headed people I have ever known were adult hemophiliacs, second only to their wives and mothers.  Please feel free to message me anytime, I would love to hear more about your dad. Thank you for taking the time to share. I am sorry for all that you are going through. I take some comfort in the fact that stories like his (and many of our own) will soon become less and less frequent. So if and when you ever decide to have a child, know that there are so many more options today than what your father had. He went through the thick of it and it sounds like he is lucky to have you and your mom.\n\nTake care. Excuse my ignorance, Triple H Club? My guess is Hemophilia, HIV and Hepatitis? Yes, a very exclusive club called the Tripple H Club.  Basically a show of sadistic humor most of the older hemos have grown to enjoy.  Having a sense of humor when living with chronic crap is a must. Thank you for sharing. I was born the year that recombinant factor came out so I am one of the oldest of the \u201cyounger class\u201d of hemophiliacs that came after the blood tainting issues. To this day, I have only met a handful of severe hemophiliacs that made it through the 80\u2019s, but those guys were some of my biggest inspirations for me growing up and learning to deal with life. People like your father are rare in our community, and I bet he is got some excellent. All the best to him, and to you and your family. Absolutely, got to make light of the shitty cards that have been dealt!\n\nSucks to hear, thankfully your struggles have brought a lot of attention to our disorder and made things unbelievably better for the younger generation.\n\nWas it all a result of the Bayer scandal? Yes, the contamination was the reason for the second two diseases.  Bayer was the largest player but not the only one.  Three other manufacturers and even the NHF all took part. \n\nYour dad however had to deal with treatments, or in reality go without treatments that I was lucky enough to have because guys like him were around.  He would not have had factor at all when he was young.  The factor infected the hemophilia community with HIV and HCV but was better at stopping bleeds.  \n\nReally any hemophiliac over the age of 38 is pretty damn lucky to be alive today.  Unfortunately when most people lost their sibling the way your dad did, they pulled back from the hemophilia community.  Do you mind if I ask if your dad stayed involved in the community or not? Sorry, I am not the OP in this thread. I am actually the result of a genetic mutation, the first in my family tree with Hemophilia.\n\nYou will want to ask /u/skywasyellow about her father.\n\nI am curious as to what your feelings are towards the organizations like Bayer. To me, being 28 years old, they are my life savers, but 10 years before me they were both the giver and taker of life. I feel like that would leave many very confused on what to feel. Oh, sorry for not paying attention.  In reality, I need to use clotting factor.  Manufacturers are a necessary evil.  That does not mean I trust them to do what is in my best interest.  I refuse to use a Bayer product myself because of personal bias.  I know I was infected through a Bayer product that I received well after they knew it was contaminated.  There are numerous other manufacturers' products available in the US.  \n\nI keep a skeptical eye on manufacturers and what they are doing.  It was not until a company called Genentech proved Bayer lied about not being able to heat treat that they started heat treating the factor.  Then even though they started making heat treated factor they kept selling the contaminated factor for 2 years until the FDA sent them a memo forcing them to recall it.  Once they pulled it from the shelves here they sold it in Canada and other countries.\n\nSorry if I do not trust the company that began its life making chemical and biological weapons for Nazi Germany and testing them in the concentration camps.  That is who Bayer is. Thanks for answering my question in depth. I grew up using Bayer product and have known nothing but it.\n\nIt was not until I was a teenager did I learn what a shitty company they are. Unfortunately, we do not seem to have many alternatives in Canada and I am choosing not to make a switch for fear of developing an inhibitor and as gene therapy is in the near horizon. I may as well wait for a \u201ccure\u201d. He has lived a full life in spite of everything.. and you are right about my mother. She has been at the hospital with his for at least 12 hours a day for the last month. She learned how to infuse him when he got a picc line last summer (before he tried immunotherapy) and was incredibly at ease giving him his factor. \nI wish the best to you and your girls. I can guarantee they cherish you, my dad\u2019s hemo never stopped us from spending valuable time. Thank you. I think Kogenate is actually a pretty safe choice and coming from someone who does not like Bayer, I guess that is a compliment.  I am not keen on the pegylated products or any of the other \"long acting\" products.  I think their long-term safety is questionable and the efficacy is not equal to the hype.  Hemlibra is looking extremely good but I do fine with traditional recombinant product so I see no reason to change. Thank you for sharing, I am so sorry to hear about your dad. I hope he is comfortable and pain free right now. We are all with you! &lt;3 \ud83d\udc9c Thank you for this beautiful message.\n\nI am so sorry your are dealing with your father's failing health.  But it is incredibly special for you to take time to send this incredibly heartfelt, sincere message to us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a severe VIII 36 year old whose family has dealt with a lot of the same issues as yours.  If you ever need to talk, you can always DM me. Such a good point about the OP's mom.  True, unselfish love through difficulty is an incredible thing. Between zyklon B and giving hemos those disease, it is a company I will never trust or use. Many other companies have clean records and a fairly ethical background. Bayer took the infected products that were banned in the US and continued selling them in overseas markets like japan, while fully aware they were spreading those diseases\n\nFuck bayer. I met an older doc the other day. He talked about the 4 H's in the early 80's:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaitians, Homosexuals, Hemophiliacs, and Heroin users\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese were the groups affected by a mysterious new disease, before HIV even had a name.", "I am obviously a carrier and have had this card since my haemophiliac son was born. But what does it mean?! Nobody ever explained it to me.  It looks like a reference card for emergency room physicians. It says that your son\u2019s factor VIII level is 0.41 (severe) and that he does not currently have an inhibitor to factor. It also gives the numbers for his hematologist, which is really the most important part, because in an emergency most physicians will not really know how to manage hemophilia and the hematologist can help them over the phone. This is my card?! Not sure why I ever need one. My sons is &lt;0.1 Hmmm. I am not sure that they meant it to be a card for you, unless you also have factor VIII deficiency. Some carriers do, but not typically that low. However, if there is a notation difference between US labs and UK labs, and what is on your card equals 41% in the US, then that could totally be what it is, and would mean that you have a slightly increased risk of prolonged bleeding yourself since your factor VIII level is lower than normal. It does look like your card gives the factor level in International Units (IU)/ millileter, and US levels are typically reported in IU/deciliter... the more you know, eh? \n\nI think they wanted anyone caring for you in an emergency to know you have low factor levels, just in case you were having issues with bleeding. Here is a little more information about low factor levels in women: \n\nBest of luck! Thank you! That is what I do not understand as no physician has ever told me that I could have a deficiency just that any surgery or severe accident I would need factor. Needed factor after all my children.  I am from the UK. Will take a look at the article:) My mum is a carrier and she has a slight factor 8 deficiency as well. You carry a copy of the faulty gene, but also a copy of the non-faulty gene, whilst one corrects out the other it is not always a 100% correction hence your deficiency. I am amazed you got a card and any recognition for having low factor at all! Very different experience in Australia for females.", "Hi, I am a mild type A hemophiliac and I am looking to know more of what I can do to help fight my disease I am 19, but my parents did not let me see me hematologists for about 8 years or so of my life because I used to always pass out from blood tests (or at least that is why I think they did it). Luckily I have only needed Factor for only about a month ever in my life.  I want to know how I can get involved more in the hemophilia and bleeding disorders community.  I have always been unable to make it to the hemophilia walks nearby, but I want to know what I can do.", "Chronic nose bleeds are ruining everything Literally every single day of my life at some point of the day my nose will randomly start bleeding and not only a little. At school, at work, with friends, while running my nose just starts bleeding and fucks everything up forcing me to run to the nearest bathroom while pinching my nose like an idiot and then forcing me to explain to people i have a genetic disorder after having to pinch my nose for 20 minutes, Its so embarassing. \n\nIve tried everything, nasal gels with antibiotics, lubricants, cyklokapron, nose cauterization 2 times. Nothing works. Its so tiring. I just want to be able to live normally without having to worry about my nose. Have you used Tranexamic Acid at all? It is what my Haemophilia Department advise I take if I am getting regular nose bleeds. I hear your frustration and am sorry you are going through this. No solutions here but hope you find something that works. I took some photos quite a few years ago of my face just pouring blood everywhere and captioned one for Facebook with something like: \"Real love does not take days off.\"\n\nAre you a severe hemophiliac? If so, I would wonder if anything changes if you were taking Hemlibra. It only puts a person in \"mild\" status, but it is been a life changer for me. Try daily intranasal amicar if it is available where you are. It has to be compounded and sprayed daily for maintenance but helps a lot with nosebleeds for most people. Hemlibra was a life saver for my son...totally worth it if you can...they have a program through gentec where you can get it for free... Hey buddy, you remind me of myself when I was younger. I made post on here which did not go into too much detail about my nosebleeds but it was just as bad. Some hemophiliacs including myself tend to get a nose bleed fairly easily and the only way for the nose bleeding to go away is time.. as you grow older, your nose bleeds should come to a halt as did for me and several other hemo\u2019s i know. When it eventually does stop targeting your nose, it may transfer over to your joints which is the most common for Hemophiliacs A or B. When I did have nosebleeds tho; I pinched my nose right then and there wherever you are and look up for 5mins. The pressure needs to be constant as well, not too light but not too hard that you are going to break your nose. Only ample pressure is needed. This is the most important part, when releasing your nose from a pinched position, DO NOT just let go of it after holding that pressure and start moving your nostrils or anything of that sort. Slowly release the pinch as to not tear the blood clot you just formed. Take your factor regularly and keep a ice pack around. You can use Tranexamic Acid or Amicar. Speak to your Hematologist for which one suits you better. You will be better soon, do not worry. In addition to the amicar people suggested and factor, I would suggest taking vitamin C 1000 mg every day if you can Thanks for the great advices, it really helps me put things in perspective. How old were you when the nose bleeds started reducing? Bc I turned 18 this month Ahhhh good old 18. I had few nosebleeds at that time but I did still have it once in a blue moon. When I turned 20, it was gone completely. I am now 25. Sorry to hear that, but maybe your body is unable to bear heat. Try avoiding foods which contain caffeine or spicy foods. Drink more water and keep your head cool. Wear a cap I guess. Although I am not sure if you have done it but visit your nearest Hemophilia society or a doctor who can help you with this or perhaps a nose specialist. It sounds like your bleeding is not controlled and after some pressure or movement it starts again. Take a day or two off, relax and breath try breathing through your mouth more. And apply some ice packs to head. I hope you feel better. If you need anyone to talk to, PM anytime. Cheers Ive had a couple of appointements with professionnals and specialists they only prescribed cyklokapron nasal gel and antibiotics which didnt really work That sucks, I guess you try the method provided the gentleman above who suggested to pinch your nose. Also, try some methods I suggested maybe they can help. Seems like you just need a break and relaxation. Good luck! Urgh. Feel for you! Nosebleeds have been a feature in my life with severe VWD\u2026.\nSo aside from the meds etc\u2026.\n\nI can recommend a cold soda can or ice pop - firstly to put between your eyebrows to help blood vessels contract. \nThen to drink/suck as will also cool the inside of your mouth (and if you are like me, take the taste of the blood away as it is trickled down your throat\u2026) \nIce cubes also work but less tasty\n\nAlso have you checked for seasonal allergies! Hayfever will often trigger bleeds. \n\nMy mom was convinced I had more when I was having a growth spurt\u2026 and they have been better since adulthood so it does probably have something to do with it. When I was 18 I had nosebleeds 1-3 times a day, made working in a resturant a pain in everyones ass because I either bleed into food or had to run away for 20-30 min while I was waiting for it to stop. I am now 28 turning 29 and I have nosebleeds 1-2 times a year now. Scared the hell out of my partner the first time I had one when he was around, he even called the non emergency number for a hospital because he went full panic while I just sat there calmly waiting for it to stop. Please stop with this herbalism bullshit. Vitamin C does not help with hemophilia, and you post this type of garbage here all the time. Vitamin C is not an herb, and, in my experience, nutrition and anti-inflammatory supplements do help with reducing bleeds from my personal experience as a severe hemophiliac.  I do not want to argue online. Agree to disagree. Nutrition and herbs can bring anti-inflammatory effects to the body and help reduce bleeds, in my personal experience. Let me put it this way: there is no evidence to suggest that eating vitamin C in any way helps with hemophilia. Unless you have a peer-reviewed study you want to share on this claim your \u201cexperience\u201d is anecdotal, which is at best misinformation and at worst harmful. No hematologist has ever suggested this as a lifestyle change for hemophiliacs because there is no evidence to support this bogus claim I would say that there are likely peer reviewed studies on the connection between nutrition and hemophilia. \n\nMy experience with vitamin C and nosebleeds is anecdotal. I am not a healthcare professional. Just a severe hemo patient with things I have tried. \n\nWhen I suggested vitamin C, I should have said, as I have said before, do your own research and decide if you would like to try it. I am in no way prescribing it or offering scientific evidence. \n\nJust something that has worked for me. There is also evidence that, for MD students, \u201cOn average, students received 23.9 contact hours of nutrition instruction during medical school\u201d, in ( peer-reviewed study. \n\nImo, you would be lucky to have a hematologist who was able to be conscious of nutrition\u2019s relation to staying healthy as a hemophiliac, but that is likely not the case for many, certainly not for me. It feels so much better knowing im not the only one that went/is going through that. As the only hemophile in my circle i often feel weird or like theres something wrong with me conpared to other and while it might be the case knowing others have went through that is releaving and makes me hopeful, thanks for your comment. Fully agree. Over here where factor availability was limited in the past, some hemophiliacs tried this nutrition nonsense and most ended up with permanent joint problems if they were lucky while the unlucky outright died.", "New Gene-Therapy Treatments Will Carry Whopping Price Tags  That was an article about leukaemia. Perhaps you were confused?  If you read the article further it goes into detail around how providers are thinking about the financial obstacles around how expensive gene therapies will be billed, not just around leukemia. This is very applicable to hemophilia gene therapy treatments, as they will undoubtedly experience the same cost structure issues as well. Half a mil. I already have difficulty copaying 1k a month for prophylaxis.\n\nI need to change my career for a high paying one. Or get into a clinical trial. I was. How many of them can you get into? Depends on what the trial drug was and how long ago you were in it.  Go to clinicaltrials.gov and look up a trial.  They will have patient eligibility data as well as exclusion criteria for any of their listed trials. Honestly it is not surprising. \n\nGene therapy/editing is going to be a personalized manufacturing process. Your basically paying for a custom hopefully one time treatment/drug, and there are no economies of scale to apply. It is not like the products of old where you had a pool of patients to make money off of year after year to offset for the cost of good sold, so now you have the same or in reality a smaller eligible pool of patients with potentially a one time use to cover your cost of goods sold so they have to charge way more to make the numbers work.  Or live in a state with an adult state run assistant program. \n\nOr tap those co-pay assist programs.  Absolutely, and in our case I do not see how they would ever make the numbers work. When many of us have treatment bills in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, gene therapy would have to be a few mil. I am hoping in the future they can use off-the-shelf T-cells and just bulk produce them to keep the costs down. Well in our application it is not t-cells, t-cells are for the immune system.\n\nFor hemo application there is still the mode of inserting the new genitive material. Additionally, the various mutations of the gene that causes hemophilia  would keep it fairly personalized I imagine.  Are not there only a handful of factors that cause hemophilia? Cannot you just create adenovirus with DNA payloads for each clotting factor? You can, but if you have the antibodies for the adenovirus being used your out of luck. \n\nBut like I said, I imagine that the payload could vary due to the mutation. It is probably more complicated than that too, but it is what I have gleaned from the available material.  &gt; Gene therapy/editing is going to be a personalized manufacturing process.\n\nAFAIK current hemophilia gene therapy is not that personalized.  They can brew batches of AAVs for use by more than one patient.   I think it will be somewhat personalized at some stage of mfg because of the risk of it not working or causing an adverse reaction. \n\nthere are only so many strains of AAV being worked with in general across all therapy applications. It not as simple as \"brewing up a new batch\". But, I could be wrong.  They are doing like 9 patients for all of the gene therapy drugs I have seen around, that is going to be very hard.  I did not mean to give the impression that researchers are inventing new AAVs out of thin air.  They pick one from the 12 known human AAVs to act as a foundation for a particular application, in this case hemophilia gene therapy.  They then bioengineer that foundation to add or delete aspects of it.  One important addition is the DNA for the FVIII or FIX gene.  The end result is an exemplar virus that can be mass produced or \"brewed\" as I put it earlier.\n\nGetting back to the original point I was trying to make:  nothing in this process is specific to a particular patient.  Patient A is infused with the same vector as Patient B.  \n\nThere may be personalized hemophilia GT vectors in the future but that is not the current approach.\n Fair enough, that is my basic understanding of it as well.\n\nI suppose that what I meant is that the application of the treatment will have to \"personalized\" in that you will be screened for the AAV antibodies to their particular vector. Additionally, I wonder if they would even bother with a small scale run using a patients material to predict response levels. So, at some point the vendor might perform assays on your material. Much of this has to do with the Novartis leukemia therapy that is 1/2mil but if it does not t work they do not charge you, I feel that is a loaded promise because by the time they actually give that therapy to you they have screened and done enough \"homework\" on you to be willing to make a 1/2 million dollar bet. ", "Anyone run a business from home?  Hi everyone, \n\nI am a severe factor 9 haemophiliac from Canada.  I am 35 years old and my ankles are starting to cease up to the point where moving for more than an hour becomes unbearably painful, in general, it is just painful, I am sure many of you are familiar with this experience. \n\nI graduated in 2015 with a degree from university in product design. I have not found any work and much of the work resides outside Canada. After having read some of the comments regarding insurance caps in the United States I am really not interested in moving.\n\nI am not interested in ankle fusion either\u2026 I feel in the future artificial cartilage and 3d printed bone may bring tangible relief to those of us suffering from degenerative arthritis and bone deformity. I have told my Doctors my intention is to \u201cpark\u201d my ankles and that is what I have done. Thankfully, I have a really supportive partner who has enabled me to work from home. \n\nI am trying to build an online business. I found my passion later in life and I loved welding making furniture and the likes but not being able to stand move or explore feels like once again the walls are closing in.  So again I find myself switching gears, trying to turn that passion into something digital.\n\nThis disorder is very limiting and from the outside, we can look normal like everything is all right. I do not even bother telling people anymore it is such a rare disease people are so ignorant it pisses me off\u2026 I know, it is not their fault either. I am pretty bitter and I keep to myself mostly these days. I would rather stay home then go grind what little cartilage I have left. \n\nI know I have it good and I hope I do not come across as a whiny bitch. I stumbled upon this forum when I was having a really bad ankle day\u2026 I needed to read something from someone who understands this shit. I read a post from one of you who had grown up with no factor and in much more pain than I have ever been explaining how fucking brutal his day was. It broke my heart; I had no right to bitch that day. This shit wears on us all. Anyways I am happy to be here and hopefully get to know some other hemos.\n\nI guess after all that nonsense my question is any of you guys out there manage to build an income stream from home or work remotely. How do you accomplish your goals with limited mobility? if so please share your tips or advice for pushing through...\n This is not a response to your main question, but have you ever tried an ankle brace?  I found ( about a study of two types of ankle braces.\n\nI have two bad ankles too, but they do not seem to be as problematic as yours.  I feel the same was as you do about fusion, but I am afraid  the other options you mentioned may be too far off.  Also, I have been told that at least one of my ankles has probably partially fused itself.\n\nIs there such thing as a \"clean out\" type of procedure for ankles?  I have heard of it for knees but do not know about ankles. I do IT work and it is worked out well for me. I do not work remotely, but I know guys that do. My job is more physically active than your typical IT job, but I know plenty that are not. Once you get into a job like this and gain a decent enough reputation people are more willing to be flexible in my experience. \n\nSome jobs are more willing to let you transition to remote after you have done some time working in an office for a year or so. Find something you are interested in that looks suited to working remotely then chase after it.\n\nIf you need something to hold you over until you find something better I know some call centers were starting to hire people to work remotely from home. You basically signed into a system from your computer and they gave you an ip phone. Then you could take calls from your house. I was a network admin for a call center that was looking into this several years ago and I know a few started doing it. Not sure how widespread it is these days.\n\nI am not saying everything is easy. I am lucky right now to have a manager that is flexible and joints that are in good condition due to prophy.  I have went back and forth with hiring managers over requirements to be able to lift minimum amounts of weight in job descriptions that did not match job responsibilities. Once you get an interview for one that you want focus on why you are a fit for the job. Do not make it a point to focus on needing the remote job for medical reasons. \n\nThere is a lot of jobs and industry moving to electronic and remote work so I think the outlook is good for your situation. You just have to find your niche. \n\nGood luck! Yeah, I wear two braces one on each ankle they are awesome and they make a huge difference. ASO EVO is the brand.\n\nI would not be surprised if your ankle is partially fused. At the clinic here they use ultrasound and the physiotherapist noted that the bones begin to deform from lack of cartilage. \n\nI was super reluctant the first time she brought out the ultrasound, I was scared to see the condition of my ankles. In the end, you just see a whole lot of scarring and pitting. It looked like hundreds of little ridges on some microscopic mountain. In a healthy ankle, you will see a clear but thin crescent between the bones. It was kind of beautiful to look at, the physiotherapist showed me their ankle by comparison.  \n\nSome people I know have done the fusion which results in 1 month suspended leg brutal agony bleeding like a bitch and then 6 months recovery. Lastly, you will have trouble walking on sloped/ramped surfaces, but the pain is gone. They swear by it... again I am still holding off. Yes, I find the fusion brutally primitive. I hope someone invents some 3d printed joints soon... and I hope you are wrong and it comes sooner than later for both our sake. \n\nI will ask the Doctor next time I am at the clinic about the clean out method. An electric scooter would also be a good option to minimise grinding while walking. \n That sounds reasonably fair and realistic. I have been applying to call centres, I will look further into remote jobs. In the mean time, I will need a side hustle and your recommendation sounds pretty solid. \n\nI am really set on building a business, I have published one book on Amazon so far and I plan to continue to expand the business around digital products related to my field. In time maybe there will be a silver lining to this all this.\n\nIt always inspires me when I meet a successful hemo as we face many barriers and being able to succeed despite these limitations takes some serious tact and discipline. Thank you for your encouraging advice. \n Here is another ( to ( I am definitely looking forward to gene therapy, at my clinic they mentioned it as well. \n\nI think we will all be cured of the bleeding aspect in  the next decade or so, however we will still need to find a solution to the ankles which is a condition onto itself. \n\nAgain I am praying for 3d ankles, I figure if you still have your ankle they will be able to scan it and make a reasonable print in the future, that is one of my theories anyway and a major sticking point for avoiding fusion. \n\n\"The human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art.\"\nLeonardo da Vinci... are not that the truth...\n\n\n I have severe A, have a titanium hip and a very bad left ankle so I started working retail and ended up moving into partnership too purchase the business. It works well enough, I can sit or use those squishy mats when I stand. It is nice. I have only had a couple of hip bleeds and the slightest movement was like an avalanche of blood... that hip operation must have laid you out for some time.... \n\nI hear you on the mats as well. At home, I cut yoga mats in half and then put a squishy ikea washroom mat over top. When all is said and done you will end up with two mats that are very comfortable to stand on. I find you can shift your weight to new spots as it compresses and it beats standing on non-padded surfaces.\n\nThanks for sharing your situation, it gives me a better grip on reality. It is really good to know that there are other hemos out there doing the business thing despite their limitations, a good bit of motivation! Thank you. \n\n Yeah they put me on some good drugs for that but it was still incredibly painful, they did the operation because my femur was crushed in a car accident. I was bed ridden for a year after that it was not fun. \n\n\nSo most companies make the mats I am talking about they call them \"zero g mats\" I think, but what you use sounds just as good if not better haha. &gt; I am not interested in ankle fusion either\u2026 I feel in the future artificial cartilage and 3d printed bone may bring tangible relief to those of us suffering from degenerative arthritis and bone deformity. \n\nI know its a scary proposition, but I might consider re-evaluating having fusions. I had both of mine fused in my early 30's and I was kicking myself after for not having done it sooner. I can walk normally, jog, hike, etc, with zero pain. There really is no major difference in how I walk. It is now been about 8 years and I have no ankle pain. I was worried about other bones around the ankle stretching and bleeding, it thankfully has not happened yet. Complete life-changer for me. \n\nJust food for thought. I am wondering if you have found anything on cleaning out?", "Having kids. Hey all. Just started reddit so this is a bit new to me.\n\nWas curious about those with children. Its been a topic my wife and I have been discussing lately, and with my hemophilia it makes me a bit nervous. I was curious how being a hemophiliac has interfered with your life as a Dad. I am worried that during times of a bleed, I will be unable to carry my child, ride bikes with them, or even take a simple walk. I am a severe Factor VIII so I often have trouble doing some of the most basic things. Passing my hemophilia on is also a big concern. How the genetics work, it would be my grandson I would have to worry about. \n\nAm I overthinking this too much? Or are these really concerns I would have to deal with?\n\nThanks.", "31 Apparel donates to NHF ( makes t-shirts based on NFL teams, with an artistic flair, and they donate $5 from every t-shirt to the National Hemophilia Foundation - pretty cool.

My significant otter has been dealing with joint pain in both knees. This is a person who relies on cardio workouts for mood regulation and mental health. Last year he had to stop running, now he will stop rowing, there is panic about the future, and adaptations are neigh. And so I ask:\n\nWas there a moment where you had to change your lifestyle, if so what changed?\n\nIf you have a partner, in what ways have they been (and not been) helpful? \n\nAre there particular foods that help with joint pain? \n\nIf you have had knee pain, are there particular exercises that lead to improvement/healing?\n\nI would be grateful to hear from you all. I have had to make many adjustments to my exercise time due to severe hemophilia and the subsequent arthritis and tendonitis in my ankles and knees. I have shifted my exercise away from any high impact activities. I used to love basketball, but I have had to stop the running and twisting and pivoting that is so important in a game like that. I have found that I can still get a great cardio workout with swimming, bicycling, walking, and hiking while minimizing the impact effects by simply being careful and mindful of my lower joints while doing these activities. \n\nI have found my knees and ankles will hold up pretty well if the exercise is gentle movement of the joint and not so much the bouncy, impactful movements. Stepping softly and purposefully, picking up my foot and rotating it and placing it back down instead of twisting the knee and ankle joints...Purposeful and thoughtful movement is a great way to prevent the pain in my degraded joints. \n\nAlso, he can look for activities that he may enjoy that simply do not utilize the lower body much. Yard work and gardening are two activities I love that primarily use my upper body and back. I can rake up a sweat very fast and hardly use my legs for anything. \n\nI would also recommend he talk to his doctor about pain management options, and physical therapy too. I absolutely despise being dependent on any medications, but I reluctantly accepted my doctors advice to try out an arthritis medication called Celebrex and it has absolutely changed my life for the better. I was using a cane to walk and could barely stand for more than a few minutes before I started on it. Now I can function normally with minimal pain and I have not used a cane in years. Cannot speak to knees but I have two end stage ankles. Rowing was a good workout but eventually it just caused swelling and pain like everything else. Swimming is excellent. I am fortunate enough to live near a lake and so I will be doing MUCH more of this this summer. I strongly recommend the water. Is he on prophylactic care? I can exercise more on days that I prophy infuse than on days I do not. \n\nWould he be Interested in taking up swimming? \n\nUnfortunately I hit a point in my late 20s when I had to stop running due to joint bleeds in the knees Thanks for the details (and the idea of gardening!) Thank you, had not thought about swimming at all Yes, he injects daily, and also is in his late 20's. Seems like swimming is making waves- definitely will be the undertaking this summer I am 25. Used to be completelly locked in wheelchair, now walk at least 5km(3miles) with 10kg backpack everyday, and increasing goal every month. All because of better treatment(hemlibra). Not sure what is available to you, but from my perspective with good, proper treatment he should be able to continue everything. If he is in a lot of pain replace joints(last hope)? Know few hemophiliacs after joint replacement, doing kind of extreme sports. Need a bit more info to give better and more complete advice :) Being that a lake is literally a block away from me, and a much larger lake only a few miles away I also plan to get a simple kayak soon. Nothing crazy fancy, just a modest one man kayak. It is sitting exercise, which makes perfect sense for my ankles (also likely your partner's knees) It would also allow me on the water even in colder, albeit arguably less pleasurable, weather. I imagine good fast pace row with a double oar is absolutely perfect cardio and the only leg work to speak of is basically just bracing your body inside the kayak. Does he visit an HTC (hemophilia treatment center) I would suggest talking to the physical therapist there.  Knee pain that stops one from exercising is not normal for someone in their 20s, even with hemophilia.  It is possible that the issue is treatable - maybe his factor is not working properly and he needs to switch brands, or maybe he even developed an inhibitor.  Maybe there is something else going on separate from hemophilia.   Please let the hematologist/physical therapist know! My whole life has been an exercise in adapting my life style. But I have done more than 99% of people I know. If he needs the happy chemicals from exercise try swimming. It is super easy on joints and you can get a hard workout still. \nPartners can be helpful to me when they leave me alone when I am in pain, I do not like being grumpy around people and hurting their feelings when I am down with a bleed. It is nice to feel understood, but you will likely never understand what it is like to deal with bleeds. It is so hard to explain to anyone how it works. But making a good meal for him will probably always be appreciated!\nKnee bleeds are one of the hardest to \ndeal with. Besides hips, shoulders, elbows, ankles, well...\nLetting bleeds fully heal before walking, and then some more healing after they are healed before walking is best. \nAlso, always encourage treatment (infusing with factor). If he thinks it is a bleed, it is. Infuse. If it hurts at all or might be a bleed, infuse, it always is. If it is not healing fast enough and he wants to \u201cwalk it off\u201d that is almost always a bad idea. If it still hurts it still needs rest and treatment. Hemophiliacs do not get hurt, or feel pain somewhere, and not bleed. Someone might disagree, and to that I would say they are wrong! Better safe than sorry either way. \nNeed any more advise?

Can happen behind one eye, or both.   Not fun\n\nand now for the most odd and problematic one...\n\nCLOGGED TEAR DUCTS!\n\nThe first one happened happened pretty soon after I started hemlibra.    I did not do anything about it, and it eventually turned into a chalazion, which required some pretty horrible eyelid surgery to remove.   \n\nYesterday, I woke up with a very irritated eye.  Different duct.   It was near the main tear duct, closest to your nose - the one that is visible.\n\nI immediately started putting a hot towel on it, and at the end of the day, there was a small pimple sort of thing on the ridge of my eyelid.  Just a tad bit of force pushed it out, and now it seems to be better, but I have NEVER had this sort of problem before... forget it happening twice in a year.\n\nI am SERIOUSLY starting to wonder if the pros from hemlibra outweigh the cons.   The muscle pains alone are the reason why I am typing this right now...  Just horrible.  \n\nNot to mention the bloody insurance company puts up a fuss now that I am on it and thinks I do not need standard factor VIII recombanate for breakthrough bleeds. GO TO YOUR HTC OR HEMOPHILIA DOCTOR. If you really think you are having serious issues Reddit is not the place for you, tell you doctor! I am on hemlibra and have not had any of these issues, but if I had, holy crap I can tell you for sure I would not be posting on Reddit about it. Go see your doctor, that is the best advice anyone on Reddit can give you. \n\nIf you really want my advice? The tear duct thing sounds completely unrelated to hemlibra simply because there is no connection I know of between blood clotting and clogged tear ducts. Again, go see a doctor. As for muscle cramps and aches, you could be having micro bleeds and not know it, hemlibra works well for me, but it might not work as well for you. \n\nThe point is: GO SEE A FREAKIN DOCTOR IN CASE THIS IS SERIOUS. YOU HAVE INSURANCE SO I KNOW YOU CAN, GIVE ME PEACE OF MIND AND SEE YOUR DOCTOR!!! Def agree. Go talk to your doctor! I still get break thru bleeds and even spontaneous bleeds sometimes. So if I did not have factor I would be screwed. I do use about 1/10th of the factor I used to tho, so it is been a great help. I was experiencing sore joints for the first few months on Hemlibra, so I switched to weekly injections , thinking that the immune response to so much Hemlibra at once (doing every two weeks but a bigger shot) could be the problem. It seemed to help. I still have stiff joints in the morning, not bleeds at all, just my hands are still, my knuckles. I do not know if that is from the Hemlibra or not. No other side effects that I know of. But it is a new medicine and I would be surprised if there does not prove to be some issues for some people. The delivery system that Hemlibra uses is used to deliver other drugs for other ailments, and they have been around longer. I cannot remember the class of drug they are called, but I know that some people using similar stuff have had side effects, so maybe that is something to think about. It was not a blocked tear duct... blocked oil gland.  Sure... could have been a coincidence.   Sure seems very odd.  Maybe I am just getting old....  Something is weird about this medicine. \n\nA doctor is not going to be able to verify if I am having microbleeds into my muscles, and if these (before, unknown to me) bleeds are caused by some sort of weird disruption in the clotting cascade.  \n\nI can tell a doctor about this, and he will be like \"Oh.. uhh hmm... OK... Yea... uhhh...  No clue.\"\n\nThere is just too few of us, on different and new medications.   You are going to know more about hemophilia than 9 out of 10 doctors.  Think about that for a second.. I do not use a 1/10th of what I did, but it is definitely less.  VERY few joint bleeds.\n\nYea...  The hemlibra definitely makes my joint seem \"arthritic\" or something.   Hard to explain, is not it?    I am thinking to switch to weekly injections, but when I brought it up to my doc, he said \"Well, the problem with changing the medicine dosage is that the insurance companies will not cover it.\"\n\nMight just do it on my own.   The problem is that I would much rather experience 3 days of intense muscle pains once every other week, then 2 days of intence muscle pains every week.   We will see what happens there.\n\nIt is a \"mab.\"   Monoclonal Antibody.\n\nKeep an eye out for those new commercials with meds that end in \"mab.\"   There is TONS of them.\n\nI mean, this medicine has a \"boxed warning.\"   It is killed people.  Specifically, people who have used ... oh boy...  It is some sort of adjunct medicine.   I will try to remember to find that and let you know, if you do not already. The thing is that weekly doses are less medicine once a week, rather than twice that, all at once , every two weeks. So for me, my body can handle the lesser amount every week, but had a harder time with the double dose all at once. Get me? So it did seem to lessen the joint soreness by a lot. I still get it a little, but it is not as bad. I used to use a lot of factor, like every other day, then I would still bleed on top of that and need more at times. So on Hemlibra now I am infusing once a week or so on average , instead of almost every day on average. So maybe not 1/10th of what I did before but something like that. \nThis whole idea about \u201cdo not treat your hemophilia as needed, because the medicine is too expensive\u201d is such a fucked up way to think of it. I do not prescribe to that bs. I know it sucks dealing with insurance and jumping through all the hoops, but I have always found a way to make sure I have what I need. And I do realize a lot of that has had to do with luck and privilege. But any doctor or provider that tells me I am not worth the $ can fuck right off. It is a ridiculous idea. It is not my fault the US Jack\u2019s the price of prescriptions up so high. It is the CEO of Bayer that should feel bad, not me. I have dealt with so many fucked up situations trying to get factor. Being on ssi disability to get insurance, and not being allowed to work or own anything for years, to now paying 1500 a month for insurance, plus a $10,000 a year deductible, plus $5000 a year deductible for prescriptions. Luckily there is factor copay programs. Point being, any dr that tells me that insurance will not pay needs to get a clue. That is not their job, to save the Govt or big business money. Doctors are supposed to help people, and prescribe the medicine that you need, and let the insurance companies pick up the pieces. Idk what I am trying to say. I am greatful for the access to factor. I have lived without it before at times and it sucked. When I switched to the synthetic factor it did not work as well, but it took a year of ankle bleeds and not being able to walk for 8 months before anyone figured out that was what the problem was. Then 5 years of PT later I was back to normal. Anyways, I wish people could stop thinking you can put a price on someone is health. I get it, factor costs a lot to make. But it sells for a lot less in India than in the US. So there is more to it than the cost of production. People are becoming billionaires while we are told it is too expensive to live without pain and being able to walk properly. I think the hemophilia community needs to re think the idea of being worthy of treatment. If it made sense I guess I would almost be able to understand the idea, but it does not add up. I am pretty sure your doctor is wrong about your insurance. And even if it is not, it is really none of his business to talk about your finances. He is your doctor not your accountant. Oh believe me... I hear ya brother!   I am going to ask him about this, and I can at least say that I know of someone else who had the same problems as me, but reducing the doseage and going weekly helped out.   It never made sense to be why to give the shot bi-weekly instead of weekly...  less peaks and valleys in the levels of antibodies that way. Cannot you ask your clinic? Like yeah your family doctor may not know but the clinic who initially put you on hemlibra should I hope", "What do you guys think about radiosynovectomy?  Never had one. Should have had one decades ago after I started getting repeat joint issues. \n\nIt sounds like a total pain in the ass, though. From the description of my old HTC, it sounded like for me it would not have offered much relief. \n\nIf you are young and do not have a lot of joint damage, you may look into a long acting therapy like hemlibra if possible. That is done more for me than anything else.\n\nEdit: I should clarify I am not young and have tons of joint damage and switching to hemlibra was the best decision I have made in my treatment. If anyone is having issues with bleeding and might benefit from hemlibra, I recommend it from my own experience. It is not only something to switch to if you do not already have damage. Had one when I was 16 on my left elbow and it worked for a while. I ended up needing to get my elbow arthroscoped and will eventually need another. It is just a way of kicking the can down the road. If you bleed enough the synovial lining will eventually just bulge again. \n\nThe procedure itself is OK, they stick a long needle in to your elbow and inject it, then it hurts a lot. I had it done like 14 years ago though so the process might have changed. Severe A here  \nHad it done to my elbow, which i could not straighten, let alone lift something or brush teeth. After 2 procedures I was able to regain some of my strength, going as far as hitting the weights at the gym. That right elbow is still like 20-30% weaker than my left elbow, and till this day cannot stretch it fully, but the pain is gone, i can do bascially everything i want. There is not even a comparison. Highly recommend radiosynovectomy. Had it done in 2014 or 2015 cannot remember. I had it done 4 years ago and it should have improved my ankle greatly. However I was 16 at the time and didn\u2018t stay in bed for the 60 or so hours that they recommend.\nResult: I did not feel much improvement at all.\nWe are discussing the possibility of a second try. Yet we are not sure if the first go was unsuccessful due to my mistake or the treatment itself.\n\nMy pain tolerance is a bit higher than the average person. Nevertheless, in my eyes, the procedure itself didn\u2018t hurt much. I got an arthroscopic synovectomy on my left elbow, not the same but it did help with the constant joint bleeds I was getting. My last elbow bleed was october 2019 as I was getting used to holding a baby during that time. Now a days, I just get really bad nerve and arthritic pain. But no bleeds! How old were you when the procedure happened? \ud83e\udd17 Hemophilia A here. I had mine done back in the early 2000s when I was having a bleed or more in my right ankle every month. I have had arthritis in that ankle since I was 6 years old. I had the procedure done when I was 14-15 years old.\n\nNow, nearly 20 years later and I have not had a bleed in my right ankle for years. I went several years being totally noncompliant with my meds, often times going months at a time without infusing, but I rarely had any bleeds in that ankle, despite having bleeds in all my other major joints on a semi regular basis.\n\nI can honestly say that the procedure changed my life entirely. If your doctor recommends the treatment and your comfortable with the follow up appointments, I personally cannot over recommend this procedure. 23/24 \ud83d\ude0a", "Any Software Developers here? Hey guys,\nI am a 20 year old residing in India with moderate Hemophilia A. I am a Junior year CS student right now, and am planning to go into the software development industry in the near future. I just want to know the experience of other developers in the community. More specifically, my questions are:\n\n1. Does Hemophilia affect your ability to code in a professional environment?\n2. Sometimes I get a bleed in my elbows, which makes me unable to code for 2-3 days, and sometimes longer. Do your managers understand situations like these and allow you time to recover?\n3. It it harder for developers like us to get jobs in the Software Industry?\n4. While on the job, does sitting for long hours affect your health in a negative way, like causing bleeds or anything else? Moderate A here. Two of the biggest advantages of being a software dev are:\n\nA) the ability to work from home\n\nB) being an almost totally sedentary job.\n\nMost bleeds do not really cause issues since you can sit or lie down, though it will be hard to work sometimes with a bleed due to lack of concentration or tiredness but for your questions:\n\n\n1) No\n\n2) Every manager I have ever had has been very understanding with this.\n\n3) No, it might even help in interviews as you can mention how you overcome challenges and are forced to have better time management etc.\n\n4) Nothing Haemophilia related but you should not be sitting for long hours anyway (if you do not have a bleed) try and get up for a stretch or walk or even go grab water often for your body and yours eyes' sake ex-freelancer/programmer, 20yo severe hemo-a.\n\n1. Coding is not only mentally restraining but puts a lot of pressure on shoulders and forearms and I had multiple elbow bleeds just cuz of typing too much. But ability to code does not gets affected where I am assuming that the term 'ability' is referring to my programming skills.\n2. Not sure about every workplace colleagues but as per my experience, most of the people do not understand this condition at all. \n3. I am not eligible to answer this as I did not try to apply for a job. I have a hemophiliac friend in the US who usually works as an tech assistant. He mentioned about changing his job a couple of times because of his health issues. For me, I had to discontinue my studies because of frequent bleeding.\n4. Physical inactivity for a longer time weakens the body and weakness might affect bleeding episodes. Even the specialist physiotherapist recommend regular workout for hemophilia patients to prevent frequent bleeding. I just do some stretching, a little walk in the room itself and drink water every then n now and I recommend the same.\n\nHope it helped. Have a good one. I am not a developer, but I have worked extensively in the software industry. I also know others who code and it is not a hindrance. \n\nRegarding the manager, it depends on each person right? Do not hesitate to take time off, attend to your bleeds and rejoin work. I normally tell them I have a joint pain, swelling whatever and that I need to rest it with cold compression, sling, pain meds etc. \n\nRemember to do the necessary physio after the bleed to keep the joint healthy long term. Many ignore this and have inflammation very soon. \n\nMost important, do not fret about these things. I am sure you will have a successful career and be well. Thanks a lot for the kind words. It really helped! Thanks a lot! Thanks for the comment.

Yes, though honestly I have more issues with pain than typing due to an elbow bleed. I have a hard time thinking straight if a bleed is bad enough, if I have a minor elbow bleed, I usually work through it, but if it gets severe, I take off.\n2. I do not generally tell managers that I have Hemophilia, and I am generally careful with whom I tell. My mother got let go when I was a kid for having a kid who was a Hemophiliac (she won that lawsuit), and I suspect it took part in why I got let go in another job several years ago. Generally, I work to establish that it does not matter what it is I am calling in for, i am calling in. And largely I do not call in enough where that mentality is an issue (usually it is not unless you run out of PTO).\n3. Do not tell them in the interview process. It is illegal in the US to not hire someone due to disability, but incredibly difficult to prove that is why they did not hire you. Just do not tell them, it should not matter.\n4. Not for me. I do get issues in my elbow if it does not have the ability to move, but that mostly surfaces in watching movies or going on long drives. Thanks a lot! Hi there,\n\n32, Severe B from India with Master's in Computer Science from IIT and now working in Berlin. To answer your questions:\n\n1. Haemophilia is not a hindrance as long as you keep it managed with proper treatment. I do not remember taking more sick leaves than any one else in my 9 years of career in Software Industry.\n2. Elbows bleeds mostly occur due to wrong posture. Get an ergonomic desk and chair and you should be fine.\n3. It is not an issue to get a job either as long as you are qualified for the position. I have worked with Top IT companies. No employers cares as long as you do your job.\n4. Sitting for long hours is bad but it is not any worse than any normal person. You need to focus on regular exercise.\n\nAll the best and let me know if you have anymore queries. Thanks for the assuring reply! Will definitely reach out if I need more guidance &gt;1. Does Hemophilia affect your ability to code in a professional environment?\n\nNo.\n\n&gt;2. Sometimes I get a bleed in my elbows, which makes me unable to code for 2-3 days, and sometimes longer. Do your managers understand situations like these and allow you time to recover?\n\nYou will be at work and no longer in school. I am not in America and over here, you will just be told to go after two three times. Even in those positions where they do not fire you, you have no hope of promotion once they understand that it is a forever thing.\n\n&gt;3. It it harder for developers like us to get jobs in the Software Industry?\n\nNo. They do not understand the real implications of haemophilia and mostly do not care either so you will be hired if you do not harp on it.\n\n&gt;4. While on the job, does sitting for long hours affect your health in a negative way, like causing bleeds or anything else?\n\nYes. Lots of bleeds. Need to be active and exercise on prophylaxis to build up muscles. Weak muscles results in bleeds as they are not strong enough. Thanks for the reply!", "Where to get factor in SC?

It could even be the sorts of questions that you are too shy or concerned to ask them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any of these sorts of questions that do not necessarily revolve around treatment and science but more around living with Haemophilia that you would like to know more about? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, this could be to do with travel, sex life, parenting, genetics, employment, etc. It could be anything really.\n\nStuff which is not being discussed by professional sources.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know your thoughts, I would really appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!\n\nLiam I do not plan on having children ever, hormonal BC affects my SO in a not great way, and other sterilisation procedures are very invasive for her, is a vasectomy even an option for me? Are there any other men with haemophilia out there who have successfully gotten vasectomies? I would like to hear what their experiences were like, there is painfully little information shared online by fellow people with haemophilia, but places like this subreddit seem to be growing and that gives me hope for the future! \n\nThanks for your post OP, hopefully it triggers important conversations I think that there is a growing trend to address the connections between Hemophilia and mental health. Professionals are beginning to realize that Hemophilia is on the edge of a very slippery slope that leads to poor mental health. Younger people that have been on prophylaxis may not have had the same issues as us older ones.  Anger, frustration, and sadness can result in a simple bleed. Now throw in pain, pain management, and disablement and you have the seeds for deep depression. On top of all that you have health care costs and availabilities, work and job security, and the normal dealings of everyday life. Is there any wonder that suicides are taking place in our community? I am sorry if I have gotten a little too intense but this is something I feel very strongly about. I wish you all the very best and you my reach out to me anytime. Thank you. Good point. this is what I was going to suggest When I was young (I am 50 now), I decided that no one deserves to have hemophilia so I was not going to have kids. I did not have any children. I can most certainly tell you that when you get to my age without having any kids you will regret it. Now I look at millions of years of successful reproduction and think that I am the weak link that let all their efforts pass away into oblivion. You think, fine, but not me...OK. \n\nI had 1 job and I fucked it up. Do not be me. Thanks for the advice, haemophilia is not the only reason I do not want kids, my partner also has a chronic illness, we have both had to take care of children and know what it entails, we are not comfortable with that level of responsibility especially considering that both of our health is not in the best condition and will not ever be. I will second this.  I am in my mid-40s and made the decision to stop this suffering with me.  Not to mention I assumed I would be in such bad shape by 30 that I would not be able to be an active, effective father.  Whoops.  Medical science has done a pretty good job keeping me up and at it and that is not something I considered when I was younger.  Life is already a little boring and I am sure it is going to be a lot lonely in another decade or so.  Hemophilia is not a reason to skip kids. Or he will not regret it.  I do not. I was wondering if there is any health issues I should be concerned about regarding alcohol. I have not asked my doctor yet and online it does not really give a good explanation if it is bad for me. It is a blood thinner but as long as your prophylacticly infusing I do not see any hard in enjoying some drinks I am going partway and adopting. There are hundreds of thousands of children out there growing up alone in the world and I can try to be at least be a good parent to one or two without passing on my illness. How are things going on providing absolute cures?\n\nHow are things going on genetic manipulation (more of interest to carriers, perhaps, but you do not want to exclude them I would have thought)?\n\nWhen is the price of recombinant Factor VIII coming down? And being bored or lonely is not a reason to bring another life, possibly the carrier of a chronic disease, into this world. I never had advices for my children's everyday safety. What are the better helmets? What are the good things for the house? For protecting the corners of tables?\nI had not clear informations on: when do I enter emergency mode? How do I know if it is important or superficial?\nI had not a clear list of which drugs should I avoid, totally or if possible. Some vaccines cannot be taken under the skin, only in intramuscular, which should be avoided. Nobody told me about it. Nobody talked about the food: some fluidify the blood, other thicken it. (' but it is useless!' I do not care, I want to know). If I think about other things I will edit. I will third it.  I am a greater.  I spent my 20\u2019s learning how to take care of you wonderful people.  I did not marry till late and we were unable to have kids.  Fortunately I have two step kids that I have come to love dearly and luckily they feel the same.  I am now 60 and for years noted how marrying and having the two step kids not only made my life less lonely, but really helps stay connected to the world.  \n\nAll your age group eventually have kids and that becomes your generational norm.  Have kids and be a scout leader and make allergen free snacks for parties.  Beats being the weird old guy down the block. How much kickbacks are the HTCs getting from big pharma? These are literally the lifelines of those companies. Hey, realize you asked this a while ago but just wanted to give you a perspective. Dunno what type you are but I am B Severe. When I was younger (Under 22) I do not think I ever got a bleed I would attribute to drinking. However, as I got older I definitely got bleeds from drinking. I believe this is due to the limited motion in my joints and the numbness alcohol can sometimes make you feel when drunk, letting me move the joints past positions I normally would not. So my general thoughts would be you should be fine if you do not already have some pretty major joint damage. Just be careful,have fun, and do your best to avoid any type of head trauma.", "Gene Therapy Update - Month 6 - A Cautionary Tale  I feel you. There are some head stuck in the sand ostrich-like doctors who insist on sticking to the data they have collected despite the patient sitting in front of them showing them otherwise. Hopefully your data gets pushed upstream to the actual researchers who can investigate the cause of your unusual reaction rather than getting buried. Thanks for the reply.\n\nI do not mean to be too down on the team. I have known a lot of them for a long time and I have always had great care. I think in my case I started by experiencing all the usual side effects the other 10 patients before me experienced. However mine seemed to evolve and get worse every week. On the flip side I reached a very high clotting factor level when they expected  it to drop and my immune system was particularly stubborn when they were trying to suppress it. My liver has also been fast to react when I come off the meds.\n\nThis is all part of being an early test case in a trial of this magnitude I guess... I feel you man.... I am in the exact same situation. Think I may be someone who was dosed not so long after you. I had the worst side effects from the steroids and tacrolimus for 3/4 weeks... all the things you described. Really really really bad bowel problems too. I will not go in to details. Tbh I do not think the severity of the drug like tacrolimus was really fully gone in to with me... I guess they did not want to alarm me but after doing a fair bit of my own reading its a pretty nasty drug to take. I am glad I am not a transplant patient who has to take it long term. I''m now in the dose reduction stages and am experiencing the side effects a lot less frequently and severely. I was also initially told 12 weeks course of both drugs but tacrolimus has been pushed up to week 20.. guessing based on their experience with people like yourself so far. It was a rough few weeks, but I think I have adjusted well.... only issue is now, I am in full shielding and lockdown until end of July at least because the medications make me a high risk individual for coronavirus due immunosupression. The one thing that has kept me going is knowing its temporary. Also, years of suffering bleeds has definitely helped me have the resilience to get this rough patch. Ultimately, short term sacrifice for potentially long term gain. But man, do these meds wreak havoc. My body did not know whether it was coming or going! Hey, that is good (or terrible) to hear there is someone out there going through the same thing. \n\nI am in to month 7 now and now and still on steroids! It really does sound like we have had a similar experience. I did my own research and came to the same conclusion about Tacro. I felt like I was experiencing everything on the list of side effects. I kept having the tacro dose bumped up because my immune system was not suppressing the way they needed it to. There was one day I was particularly struggling with the burning in my hands and feet and they upped the tacro dose by 1mg. The next day I could feel the intensity of the pain escalating. \n\nI refused to go back on Tacrolimus about 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for the side effects to subside but I am trying to stay positive about it. I am feeling pretty exhausted after the past 7 months. I suppose on a positive note I am so over having a decent clotting level that if I end up at 2% it will be a nice bonus. My hematologist just talked to be about gene therapy today. I have been hesitant in the past and content with my prophy treatment. With coronavirus going on I do not think now is a good time to start that kind of a procedure but after reading what you have been going through it makes me hesitate more. I agree that we tend to be a stubborn lot and have higher pain tolerance than most.\n\nI have just come off of ankle surgery myself. Having replaced the one joint that was really causing me bleeding troubles and still being on pt rehabbing it and working through that pain it really makes me question if I am ready for several more months of trauma on my body. Hopefully things are evening out and you are feeling better now. \n\nIf you had the chance to go back in time would you choose the gene therapy again? Hello, thanks for reading my post and getting in touch. In short, if I could go back in time I would probably tell myself not to try the gene therapy experiment. There are a few reasons for this and they are personal to me so may not be as relevant to you.\n\nI just finished my 3rd round of immune suppression this week. I have been on prednisolone for almost 8 months (aside from a few weeks off) and I was on Tacrolimus for almost 6 months. The side effects of these drugs hit me incredibly hard. A lot more than average. It put a lot of physical and mental stress on me and my family. It had a big impact on my work that will take some time to recover fully. \n\nThe benefits of being on steroids as an anti inflammatory were great while they lasted l. As I tapered off the Pred my ankle condition worsened.  I am resigned to crutches now until I get it fused and with covid affecting surgeries, I do not know when that will be.\n\nAs I mentioned above I have been off prednisolone this week and already my ALT levels have shot up. I had a choice of continuing on prednisolone to bring down my alt and manage the immune response but I feel like my body cannot handle another 10 weeks of steroids. My consultant has told me that based on my previous immune responses and the current ALT level it is likely I will have little to no clotting factor left and to be honest, while I am disappointed and a little frustrated by that it is outweighed by relief that I can finally continue my life steroid and immune suppression free. \n\nI have learnt a lot from the experiment. Firstly that Injecting 3 times a week is really not that bad. There were days where I yearned to go back to injecting for the rest of my life to not feel the way I felt on those drugs.\n\nSecondly the impact it had on my family. I am a pretty independent person and I have never let my haemophilia get In the way if I want to do something for other people. However over the past few months I have not been able to do anything for myself let alone anyone else. This put a massive strain on my girlfriend and our 18 month old baby. She had to look after me and the baby which effected her work and life balance and put a strain on our relationship her mental health and mine.\n\nI hope this has been useful and if you want to chat some more feel free to send me a message. I think I am in the minority of people who have had such a negative experience with gene therapy so bear that in mind. I do not want to be overly down about the whole thing. I think gene therapy is amazing and will be an eventual cure for haemophilia. I just got unlucky with the meds and side effects. This has been quite useful. I appreciate your candor. Ive always been an independent person myself and tried not to let my hemophilia get in the way but my girlfriend and mother just dealt with me being off my feet for 9 weeks and I am still not 100 percent at walking. so I am sure they can relate to your girlfriend about dealing with a 187lb man child that needs a lot of assistance. \n\nThe hematologist thinks I am an ideal candidate but honestly With Eloctate and only sticking once every four days I am on autopilot and fairly content with the idea of sticking for the rest of my life. It is a nice idea being able to be untethered awhile but after reading your experience it does make me hesitate more. I am not sure if I want to find out how my body responds to the drugs. coupled withe Covid-19 now is a less than ideal time to be immune suppressed. Again I appreciate you sharing the info and hearing your opinion. Being someone who has never had access issues and such it certainly leads me to the sticking myself for the rest of my life is not so bad side of the argument.", "Chris Bombardier has just made history by becoming the first person with severe hemophilia to summit Mount Everest  That is a cool ass last name.

Spent 7 days in the hospital each time, each required a fasciotomy so have nice scars on each arm, and the last one they had to transfuse 2 (almost 3) units of blood because it bled so badly.\n\nAnd about 3 years ago had a compartment bleed in my right thigh after helping prep a friends house to be reroofed. I know compartment bleeds happen, but did they say something you are doing is making you have them more? Did you wait a long time to treat? I have only had one incident where I was told to monitor it closely because I could have a compartment bleed and they thought I might have to go the hospital.Knock on wood.. The first one in my right arm was spontaneous, no idea what caused it. The second was the result of moving. I was moving apartments and carrying one end of my couch when the other end got dropped as I was coming through the door, smashed my arm pretty hard between the metal frame of the couch and the door frame, the doc's figured since it was only a couple months since the first one resolved the tissues were still tender and it caused a re-injury of the original bleed. The third one, in my left arm was the result of an accident. Was lucky my elbow did not get broken.\n\nAnd lastly part is probably due to age, 39 years old. As you get older your body does not hold up to things as well as it used to.\n\nAs to the thigh, was just probably the result of a pulled muscle that I did not get treated promptly and then kept working on the house (up and down ladders, scaling the roof, and probably generally over working it). It took about a week to go full on compartment syndrome, even with pumping in over a dozen doses of NovoSeven.\n\nMy older brother has also had problems with compartment bleeds in his arms after 30, so seems I am following in his footsteps unfortunately.

I would check to see what their procedures are for medications.  I would hate for them to sit on a shelf for a month waiting to be shipped through.

I just take a couple weeks worth, or enough to last 5 days in an emergency, and have some ready to be sent from a friend, just Incase. Customs will only give you problems if the factor is expired. Even then it is doubtful, but it has happened before sending factor to countries with strict medical policies. That may be a good idea.

Life as a bleeder has been challenging, for sure. Its as challenging a life as it would be with any other diagnosis (i assume). I was never bullied, I was pushed away from contact sports. I felt like I was weird until I attended a summer camp program for kids with bleeding disorders (ages 8-16). What could I blame my parents for? I was diagnosed as the result of chromosomal mutation (or something like that), not much to blame them for.\n\nI am not a father but what I can suggest to you is that you allow your son to be a kid. You said you are doing prophy, that is awesome. Teach him to understand why he needs it, what his meds do and how important they are. Growing up, he should know he is in fact normal and that taking factor is just the same as combing his hair or brushing his teeth. There is no reason he cannot try out for the baseball team when he is older (for example), just dose up before practices and especially before games. If you reinforce the importance of prophy and treating at the time of an injury he will have a better quality of life than if he does not dose appropriately. As your son gets older and wants to try things like sports or weight lifting or whatever it is, just be supportive. Over time he will learn when he needs to treat, and you will have to trust him to do so.\n\nWhile he is still young, get involved with a local hemophilia chapter if there is one in your area. Mine has been one of the best resources and some of the best people I have gotten to know. He will need some preferential treatment at home for sure, as did I. Like I said, teach him that dosing is as much a part of his routine as brushing his teeth, that could help normalize his bleeding disorder for HIM. 28 y/o moderate type B here. Things as a bleeder are tougher, but overall your son will live a normal life. Yeah, he will not ever be the QB of his HS football team, but that is pretty much the extent of being a bleeder in your teens. \n\nAlways let him know that he is normal, the hardest thing for me growing up was seeing myself as an outcast because of my condition. Know there are times he may get upset about his condition, but that is normal. \n\nHaving him know the importance of his proph. schedule is something I wish I would have done when I was younger, especially in my Jr. High/HS years. It would have saved me from a lot of unnecessary hospitalizations.\n\nYour son is as normal as any other kid. Yeah, its scary that he has to stick a needle in his vein, but over time it becomes as normal as brushing your teeth. I learned to self-infuse by the time I was 12. \n\nYou are doing the best thing by being supportive. As long as he has that, he is going to be absolutely fine. Thanks for sharing. My wife is a carrier and she often worries he will blame her for him having hemophilia. Our approach as a family is this is all normal, we make \"factor time\" as positive an experience as can be. He has a port right now so that makes it easier to do factor.\n\nSounds like the Summer camp was a positive experience for you and that is encouraging to hear. I assume its just like any other summer camp, or did they do anything different or special?\n\nAgain, thanks for sharing. Reading your stories helps me try to better understand and prepare. Thanks for sharing. Currently we factor up once a week via his port. My little dude is a crazy rough and tumble little guy. We treat him just like any other kid and try not to coddle him too much. Our hope is to be as unrestrictive as possible with the exception of sports, there we are always told by our HTC that absolutely no contact sports but then I talk to hemo guys and they always say the docs are being overly cuatious. My wife and I agree (now at least) that he can try any sport except football. \n\nYou mentioned the important of the prophy schedule, do you mean just like remembering to do it?\n\nis self infusing hard? did anything make it easier? Our activities at the camp were exactly the same as any other summer camp with the addition of learning how to self-infuse. Some campers do not self infuse off the bat, some learn how to self infuse on their third day. Meeting other kids with hemophilia helped me normalize it, even a lot of the staff members are bleeders. 33 y/o male with severe A. Your boy will be more than fine. If you really stick to your proph. schedule he can do sports and what not. My now 9 y/o nephew also has severe A and had a brain bleed when he was 1, today he is playing football in a club and doing fine. Of course there will be a couple of bleeds, joint pain but overall treatment has improved so much. When I was a kid I was only treated after I hurt myself or my ankle/elbow was fully swollen - that caused permanent damage. As others mentioned already, please stick to the proph. schedule and do not skip any, if you keep a constant factor level nothing can stop him! Thanks! that is great about your nephew! I hope he enjoys it. I would add wrestling to this list. I have first hand experience as mild with too many joint bleeds. X2 34, severe A...\n\n&gt;I read your stories about chronic pain, arthritis, joint bleeds etc, etc and I cant help but wonder how life for you as a Hemophiliac has been? Were you bullied, did you feel left out of sports, were you discouraged from playing sports, did you ever get made to feel different than others and if so like around what age? Do you ever feel angry about having hemophilia and did you blame your parents?\n\nMy parents were totes supportive of me being a normal kid and doing as much as I could - played soccer, went to all sorts of camps normal and otherwise - but a lot of that shit still happened, because all teens go through a shithead phase and a lot of those sorts of issues are going to bubble to the surface.\n\nBut given the recent improvements in long-term treatments (see my flair), I feel like this generation of hemophiliacs are going to have QoL beyond anything we had and will end up being closer to 'normal'. Sure they should probably still avoid tackle football, but it is going to be much easier to keep them going. 15 yo male, I have it better than most people here because I am young.\nHowever, I am going full hormones right now and I cry about being a bleeder every now and then but it is just a phase.\nWhere I live money is not an issue to hemophiliacs, so I am very lucky, and as long as you do not make prophylaxis look as anything special but something of everyday's life, it will not be stressful at all\n\nI excercise daily because I need my joints to be strong so age does not get the best of me, also being slim is a **huge** advantage for a bleeder because they will need less factor units in their proph.\nAlso, I can have the luxury of hiding my condition from my friends and they do not think anything weird  of me, neither they are more careful with me. Feeling like everyone else is really good.\n\n\nA hemophiliac probably will not be a pro athlete, but if he does not get to do excercise his joints will grow weak.\nBut of course, this is true as long as he is constantly in proph\n\nForgot to mention: Severe A Did not ever think to blame my parents. Life has been pretty great. I am 45, and have lived thru the worst that a hemophiliac can probably see, in the US with treatment available anyway. As far as hep-c, hiv and seeing 100\u2019s of friends die, mostly kids. But I have been lucky and patient and have been able to wait out bleeds and stay healthy. Also have learned to be my own advocate and tell health providers what I need. It is not a terrible thing to live with if you have the support of family and a clear head. Again, I have been blessed to have people on my side that have helped (a mother, uncle and older brother with hemophilia that have learned what to do before I came along) so things for me were not as bad as they could have been. \nMy advice as a parent is to be careful, but tell your kid that he can do anything anyone else can, while being realistic. Do not baby him. Let him try things, but treat heavily if you are able to. If he has factor in him he is pretty much like anyone. If he is hurt, infuse, period, do not question it, just do it. I have always been active and done as much as I could, but when I have a bleed I take it seriously and let it heal. If I stay active and keep pushing I do great, then if I have a bleed or am sore I slow down, but just long enough to heal up, then I am back at it. \nI think it is important to remember that troubles and challenges are hard, but they make you strong. Yes hemophilia is tough, but I would not trade it for what I have learned from it. I have been through some hard painful times but I am better for it. I am 45 and have lived through hiv hep-c and tons of bad bleeds and I am still able to ride motorcycles, play drums professionally, hike, bike, be a single parent, work full time and do more than most people I know do. And is you considerer how much better treatment is today than 40 yrs ago, I think your kid will be ok. Just educate yourself and be realistic, make sure you have insurance and can get the treatment needed at all costs , and he will be ok. I had to jump through all kinds of hoops in my life, ssi disability, spending lots of $ on insurance, learning to find loopholes of all kinds, but I was always able to find what I needed. I know I am lucky, but it can be done. Now with the long acting factor and Hemlibra available things are looking up. If you need advise pm me. It is no trouble to point new families or people who need help in the right direction. Try not to worry, take it one day at a time. It is a whole lot harder in my opinion to have a kid with hemophilia than it is to be a kid with hemophilia.. in the sense that as someone with hemophilia its all you know , and you accept it, but as a parent you have to figure all of this out, and worry, and it is hard. I get that. I understand what you are going through to some extent. My daughters are symptomatic carriers, that is half as bad as what you are dealing with and it is still concerning. But if you can do what needs doing as a parent and make sure you have good insurance and research good factor treatments and stay in touch with your htc and doctors, you will figure it out. I work with families of hemophiliacs and have seen the struggle that people deal with. It is not ideal obviously but it is not too bad either. Pm me if you have any questions. It is daunting being in your position as a parent but you will figure it out and in the long run things should work out and be ok. Try to stay optimistic. Soccer can be pretty harsh too. Bike riding as a kid was a life saver. Bmx. We had a 12\u2019 quarter pipe in our yard and rode every day. Not that I recommend a ramp like that, but riding bikes and swimming helped me a ton. Right on. Good to hear this. I do know of one professional athlete with hemophilia. Chris Bombardier, he is a mountain climber who climbed Everest. Maybe mountain climbing is t considered a professional sport, I am not sure, but he is a bad dude none the less. My uncle is 73 and has been a bush pilot in alaska since he was 15. He still flies a Grumman widgeon and lands in the ocean and lakes around alaska taking tourists and locals bear hunting and to their fish sites. That is some of the hardest most dangerous work there is. So if he can do this without any treatment until he was 30 yrs old I think it is it is possible for hemophiliacs to do pretty much anything. Let me first say, the fact that you post these questions and do your research already makes you a great parent. That being said, yes he may have a slightly different lifestyle, but with modern treatment almost nothing is out off reach. \n\nOne of the most common mistakes made is that parents and/or teachers treat a hemophilia patient as \"super fragile\". Yes, we sometimes need extra medicine, yes we need our profylaxes (especially severe patients such as myself), but more importantly, we need movement. We need to grow strong bodies that are capable of taking a hit every now and then. By staying away from every contact sport or potentialy 'harmfull' situation he will only be in disadvantage later in life.\n\n**My advise for you as a parent:** \n\n\\- Inform yourself as much as possible (already doing that so good job)\n\n\\- Explain hemophilia to every teacher/sports coach that they come in contact with and make sure they understand that IF something happens he may need extra attention, but that he is not made off glass as well. Not every little papercut is a big deal. Make sure your son can explain his own boundries as soon as possible.\n\n\\- Make sure it is not something he has to be ashamed of and teach him to talk about it with his friends on an appropriate age. Especially if he goes away for holidays etc. on his own, they have to be in the loop if something happens.\n\n**Some answers to your questions:**\n\n\\- Learning to inject yourself is different for everyone, depends on the wideness of your vains etc. That means it takes on person longer to learn that the other, however everyone can learn and once you get the hang of it, it is just like brushing your teeth. (I learned when I was 12) Practice makes perfect. When I was young I sometimes had to do it over 1 or 2 times if I didnt hit the vein correctly. I am now 28 and I think it has been at least 10 years since that last happened.\n\n\\- I never ever blamed my parents, I would however be sad sometimes if my bleeds kept me from playing with other kids / sports for a longer period that usual. My parents were very supportive of that and tried to explain as much as possible to me the importance of letting a bleed heal for long term purposes. Just be there, make sure you follow the right treatment schedule, and maybe spoil him a little bit extra during bad bleeds.\n\n**Some final comments:**\n\n\\- Arthritis / Chronic pains are pretty much a thing of the past if he is growing up right now AND his treatment is always in order. By in order I mean stick to the profylaxe schedule, and please always treat him as soon as possible whenever a bleed occurs. Every hour counts, the larger a bleed gets, the bigger the chance of permanent damage. (Do not worry, as long as you do it asap this will only happen in very bad cases with serious negligance from either the patient, the parent or the doctors.)\n\n\\- If you do some research or ask your HTC there are enough examples of hemophiliacs who play sports on a high level, even full contact sports. I am not saying this is something you should definitly pursue, if your kid likes a sport that is less full contact than let us say karate, that is better. But my point is, there is not much that is impossible! \n\n\\- Promote sports and movement to your kid, I cannot stress this enough. To much patients are just lying around allday avoiding contact/sports because of possible bleeds. The stronger your body gets early on, the less likely he is to have long term problems in the future.\n\nHope this helps and let me close by saying that I am confident that your son will have a long and happy life in this time and age in a country with good healthcare. Avoid cross country running too, that killed my ankles. Roller blading was a life saver for me, built up my legs and protected my ankles with good firm boot straps On mobile it wont let me see your flaire, at least not all it. That Is one thing our hemo doc says, she always says that the improvements in products for kids my sons age are lightyears ahead of what they were 20-30 yrs ago. She says that gene therapy may be here in my sons lifetime so maybe science will keep going in the right direction. I started as treat-on-trauma, then prophylaxis every 48 hours, then prophylaxis every ~72 hours, now Hemlibra which is 1x/month.\n\nEven if gene therapy *does not* arrive that quickly (and while I know there are some users in the sub who are in clinical trials, they have been saying \"around the corner\" for 30 years so I will believe it when it hits shelves and not a moment earlier), the fact that you can take a subq shot and be good for the rest of your month might as well be magic. Thank you so much for sharing! Your perspective and outlook on things at such an age is wonderful to hear. If I can ask, how is school like? Meaning, do you disclose your hemophilia to the school? is it something you tell your friends about? and if so how did they react? just wondering how youre navigating social things like that at your age?\n\n&gt;Feeling like everyone else is really good.\n\nIm glad you sound happy.  I thank you so much for sharing this. Its made my wifes day. Thanks for sharing!! My lil dude is a ball of energy, he is always bouncing, jumping, dancing and running around. We treat him just like any other kid because we dont want him to feel that he is not normal. \n\nIve learned to explain what hemophilia is, what to look out for and explain that factor is similar to what insulin is for diabetics. Ive found that comparison resonates with people well and makes them feel like he is less of a bubble boy.\n\nWhen we first started looking for daycares, one center made it seem as though they wouldnt take him due to the hemophilia. I lost my shit on them and brought up the A.D.A and basically did a ppt presentation on what hemophilia is and brought him in so they could see he wasnt some sort of fragile bubble boy. After that, they allowed him in. \n\nI learned then that until he can speak for himself, my wife and I are his best advocates and that theres a lot of ignorance towards hemophilia. Ive also had to learn to be less aggresive/touchy about people asking if he'a special needs or disabled and instead turn it into a learning experience for them. My goal is to give my son as normal a life as possible which is why hearing your stories is so awesome to me cause I feel like I learn from you guys. I just want to thank all of you that have chimed in. I showed my wife and she cried happy tears, i got a lil misty eyed myself. \n\nReading your stories is very rewarding, feels kind of like reading over someones shoulder sometimes so I thank you again for allowing a peek into your lives.\n\n Im in various hemophilia FB groups and theyre mostly run by moms who are just hemo warrior this, hemo warrior that which is great but for some reason they dont like it when you ask the types of questions I asked you guys. Dunno if its them thinking its negative or what but they shut it down quick. \n\nMy wife wanted me to ask hown you or your parents handled telling friends about your hemophilia? She wants to tell every kids parent we meet, im more reserved and dont want to say anything about it unless we need to so they dont treat my lil dude any differently. Dude, Alprolixis a blessing. We have done Benefix, Idelvion and now were on Alprolix. Thankfully he is only ever had one spontaneous bleed so far. It was a knee bleed and he couldnt put any weight on the leg, cried and screamed like hell. Had to factor 3 days in a row (normally we factor once a week) with two diff products but by day 4 he was no longer limping on wincing. Only my closest friends know about my hemophilia because if I told everyone they would think I am made of glass and should not be touched, I went through that when I was younger and did not like it at all.\nHowever, my school does know about my diagnosis and until I reached 11 they had a shot ready in the fridge, but since it has been seven years since last time I had a significant issue with bleeding we have reduced extra care.\nAbout how my close friends react, they do not care I think they already know I am strong enough not to worry, also, you would be surprised how basically no person has a perfect health.  \nI have no problem having an average social life, I can go out and fall and get hurt without worries, I just take care of my wounds, my mom, AKA my favourite human on earth usually puts everything I need to deal with wounds in my backpack so I do not need to hurry home. My advice as a mild hemophiliac that does not infuse is to just be supportive.  The football question even made me feel depressed, the route I chose was to trick my parents into thinking water polo was not a contact sport.  Idk I guess it varies case by case but sports are truly so important to anyone, I wish my parents were more supportive of my hemophilia and less anxious about it as they mainly just gave me anxiety about it when I was younger.  Hope I could help still, thank you it sounds like you are doing a great job raising your kid already.  The most important part is to just let him be who he wants and you are doing that even if that is a struggle.\n\nEdit: also a huge tip I learned naturally was that the more muscles you have the less you bleed, no doctor will tell you that at least not hemo doctors. 18 year old hemophilia A severe with other blood related diseases. Since my birth, my mom made me understand that I was not different, but my blood was, and growing up that helped a lot! Now I understand how some things are particularly made for me. I live in Switzerland, skiing is a big thing here and I have never been able to try it. When you are 8 and all your friends are making plans together to go ski and you are left alone it is really really hard to accept. That being said, my parents or friends of family always offered to do something else so that I was not left alone. \nThe big deal is that you have to find a way to make your child feel as normal as possible. It is extremely difficult sometimes, but the older he will get the better he will understand. Also, you need to emphasize how important medicine is for him. I know far too many fellow hemophiliacs who became teenagers and thought they were stronger than the medicine or they decided it was not worth continuing. One has serious issues in his knee that he will have all his life and the other was extremely close to die in a car accident. You never know what can happen in life, it is really important to be on top of your medication. \nIf you have any questions whatsoever feel free to pm/dm me and I will be more than happy to help you! \nGood luck \ud83c\udf40 Thank you very much! I am a severe hemophiliac in his late 30s.  My life is great. \n\nBoth you and your HTC are correct.  The things you worry about may be a part of your son's life but that does not mean he cannot live a completely full and wonderful life.\n\nI was never bullied but I did feel left out of sports when I was a kid. However, I used the extra time to do art and musicals which I loved.\n\nI would suggest putting him in schools where sports are not over emphasized.  It is not the easiest being a little boy who cannot play sports as much. However, if the social network around him is not completely dependent on sports, he will be better.  Art, computers, plays, video games etc are a good way to go.  Having said that, I am a huge sports fan and grew  up loving taking part in sports as a fan, writing for my school newspaper etc. \n\nYour son will face some extra challenges.  However, his challenges will be much easier than those from previous generations.  Those challenges will not prevent him from have a great and full life.  I find those challenges make me appreciate the good stuff in life more. I am a 16 y/o moderate hemophilia type B, I run and swim at school and no one knows about my hemophilia besides close friends and that is only because I recently had a bleed. Hemophilia is taught in biology classes so it is more known about that you may think! Hope he does well in life :) When it comes to sports, football is a for sure no. Just educate him that his body will take wear and tear a lot differently.  I played baseball and wrestled in jh/hs but i know my joints have payed a price. I would highly suggest baseball as a sport. I loved it, and minus getting beamed a few times, risk of injury was lower.\n\nWhen it comes to the prophy schedule, making it a normality. I was not put on prophy until I was 13/14 due to a reoccurring hip bleed. By that age I was trying my best to \"hide\"  my condition from my friends so sticking myself 2-3 times a week and leaving track marks was not something I was particularly interested in. \n\nSelf-infusing is not hard, but like anything it takes practice. I learned by necessity as my mother usually was the one to administer my factor. One day she was not home and I was hurting, so I thought if heroin addicts can hit a vein, I can too. It also helps that I have naturally large veins so missing was not something I was worried about. Send your boy to hemophilia summer camps if their are any in your area, I remember going a few years in a row when I was 8/9 and seeing counselors teaching the older kids with fake arms and by the end of camp they were infusung themselves. It is really not that hard, scary more than difficult tbh. When I was young, my mom would tell parents because you never know what is going to happen. For instance when i was about 7 i was sleeping over at a friend's house and i fell off the trampoline and got a pretty gnarly bump on the head. Luckily my friends parents knew about my condition and immediately called my mom. I was able to get dosed and continue my night of fun with my friend. I highly suggest telling at least your son's friend's parents when they will not be in your supervision. As I got older I let close friends know but it was not something I would tell every single person I met. I wanted people to get to know me for me and not be labeled the kid with hemophilia. \n\nAs far as other kids' parents treating me differently, not one ever did. But my mom made it clear to them that I could do anything their kid could do for the most part. Even had one friends family invite me to go skiing with them and his dad taught us both to ski on that trip. \n\nYou guys are doing great things as parents and asking all the right questions. I have never felt resentment towards my parents. They had no control over my condition.\n\nActually I feel like my hemophilia has made me closer with my parents because they have done so much for me Great info in this post. Exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are huge With my friends I just tell them and give a little explanation and it is never a big deal.\n\nOne suggestion is to not discuss your son\u2019s hemophilia too much on social media. I have chosen not to disclose my hemophilia in my career for a number of reasons. If you post a lot on social media about your son\u2019s hemophilia you will take away his ability to not tell people about his condition in the future.", "Socks! I found out through my Physical Therapist that there is a program that allows Hemophiliacs/VWD $1,000 per year towards expenses a 'normal' person would not have. I am getting around $100 in Swiftwick socks (only 5 pairs) to help with ankle bleeds. She said someone purchased a Yeti cooler for their factor with it, someone else got exercise equipment.\n\nI do not know how long I have missed out on this, and I do not want anyone else to! \n\n(I live in the U.S.) What is the name of the program?

Great idea to use as for everyday ankle compression/support I am interested in this as well. Never heard of these socks either All you need is a letter verifying your diagnosis and stating medical necessity of whatever you are getting. They also funded a Bontrager wavecell helmet I ordered last week. But for the socks, compression on your joints during exercise can reduce risk of bleed, you should check out to the Flite XT. Thank you!  I have ankle problems and if I am on them all day I can definitely feel the hurt for days after and I am not overweight. Would love to workout more but find the joint pain too much sometimes. I wonder what people could get aware with this program to take full advantage of it. Have you been to physical therapy? I am working on ankle strengthening exercises now with mine. I do not know what your situation is, but my HTC offers it free, hopefully yours does too. I go yearly to my HTC for the usual check up and see a physical therapist that looks everything over. I have been giving a few exercises but feel maybe physical therapy could be more beneficial at my age. (27M) I have been seeing my HTC PT every two weeks for a little over a month- you may be able to do some ankle strengthening on your own. I have been doing drinking bird exercises which really test your balance. I had to do bridges and monster walks for a month to get to the point that I can actually do one drinking bird rep. I hope you can get some improvement in your ankles, it is a huge game-changer. Glad to hear it is working for you and gives me some hope that I could also see some improvement!", "Volume of Prophylaxis? Hey! Severe A here on Prophylaxis taking KovaltryTM, when I reconstitute/recombinate my vial and do my infusion, there is always like a little bit of backdraw liquid (a few drops) i cant get from the Vial, it is not a major amount but i was wondering does that have an impact on the volume/dosage you should be getting? No, there is a built in margin of error for that sort of thing. yeah im still getting the 2.5cc!\n\nthank you for your response :) It is called overfill and it is accounted for.  A vial with 1.0 mL on the label actually contains ~1.1mL. so essentially im not missing any factor VIII that should be going into my veins? Correct! I use Eloctate and the same thing happens. Also happened when I was using Advate. The person who taught me how to self infuse said that it is normal though.", "Tattoos! What do you think?

I am in Pittsburgh and would be happy to help if you are crossing through PA &gt;Hi Sean,   \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are in Philly this week. Please call Melissa asap 212.505.6805. or email ", "How do you all deal with depression?  Hope everyone is doing great... jus stopping by to share my experience.. started volunteering at shelters really helps to clear the mind. Do not get to do it everyday.. but a couple hours a week make me reflect and feel appreciated.. not only by the ppl who work there but by making a bond with some animals that really need the attention.. I go to the range and shoot. It clears my mind and keeps me happy. When I can I also go to the gym but bleeds hold me back more than I care to admit.  Yea man i try to go every other day and do cardio in the pool.. im glad you have something that takes your mind off of hemophilia.. I have been trying to convince my chapter to provide some type of support programs Bob's Burgers and lexapro. Curious what does lexapro make you feel/ does it make you forget does it give you like a high euphoria feeling? It just makes me more at ease. I was anxious for a long time and it kept getting worse, so I decided to give it a shot. Consulted with my physician and escitalopram (lexapro) seemed to gel with my other meds. My go-to is a lot of marijuana and funny movies. \n\nCounseling was never recommended by any of my doctors.  Not even when they told me that they had carelessly given me two deadly diseases along with my medicine.  I am glad they do now, because it would have helped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW, your pic made me realize that I do not think I have ever seen another hemophiliac in the wild.  I do not know how I would greet another hemophiliac, but I suppose the silent nod like we are members of Fight Club would be appropriate. I am currently trying to figure it out myself. But I usually like to watch a lot of VFX heavy movies, draw, and cook something really comforting. If the pain is really bad, I take a pain killer and watch cartoons. &gt;the silent nod like we are members of Fight Club would be appropriate\n\nI like this, I like this a clot. friends and movies Getting outside with my dog helps a lot. Other than that it is trying to stay busy and active with friends or enjoying a good game/show. I volunteer at animal shelters like you as well. Something about the non-judgement of animals is very helpful  What specific suggestions have you given your chapter?  Always looking to improve our HTC and chapter. When I depressed I become funny, my friends can confirm. I get really sarcastic and basically roast myself about having hemophilia. Also pubg mobile and comedy shows. Hey brother. Thanks for the idea. I currently do not have an effective method. I will try a shelter. Stay strong my friend.  You too man stay strong! Trust me it can definitely help bring up ones spirits  Do your friends know what your doing that its your way of coping?  Yes movies definitely provide an escape for a couple of hours! Yea when pain is to bad, i usually sit back vape a thc cartridge and watch adult animation shows like rick and morty.. ive used thc as an alternative to dilaudid pain killers I am located in Texas so a couple of months ago at the Lonestar chapter I try talking to people and told them that we should have some type of support group or just meetings on how to deal with depression at conferences.. My HTC when I told them I was going through this Made me talk to their social worker but I did not feel like she understood me but I did make my point that we should have some type of get-togethers for men only no nurses no reps Yes exactly animals as long as we treat them right will always show compassion towards us they just want to be loved as well. I am glad you found something that works for you I use THC cartridges to help with pain. I am from Texas so that is a little challenging to find at times.  You have not seen another hemophiliac in the wild as in you do not know any in person?  I am not sure if they do or not. Usually they just laugh at what I say. Honestly this is the first I have heard of hemophelia chapters, and I am 26. Is it like son's of anarchy except everyone is sore all the time? The only hemophiliacs I have ever known were related to me. Every state should have some type of hemophilia chapter.. they hold dinners where patients meet with pharmaceutical reps and learn about new treatments. They try their best to solve any medical needs.. I was also in the \"there can be only one!\" zone for most of my life. It was pretty weird meeting people having the same issues as you IRL. The social worker was likely their standard pathway for mental illness.  I would ask for a counseling referral from the HTC.  Bypass the Social worker (they are good at their jobs, but if this was not enough for you or they were a bad fit for you, time to move on.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe will work on adding depression to our HTC plan.  We typically screen our teens and adults for depression at their clinic visits.  I will be sure that these  screens are active.  I will pass this on to our chapter leadership and we will work on getting it added to our annual education session's agenda.  Thanks. Hemophilia chapters are part of the national hemophilia foundation ((  You can go on this site and locate the ones that are closest to you.  This is usually a good resource for your needs and can coordinate you with homecare/pharmacies and manufacturers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you get seen at a Hemophilia Treatment Center?  If not, then you should.  They can plug you in to a chapter and can get you up to date on treatment.  Also, its been demonstrated that hemophiliacs who are treated at HTCs have fewer joint bleeds and a longer life expectancy than those who are not.  You can find the one closest to you at the website above. Yeah I have an HTC. I just never heard of a hemophelia chapter before. Thanks for the response it was very informative. Best typo of all time  I recently started seeing a therapist for the first time. I am 36 and realizing that I have been dealing with periodic depression for my entire life  I hope you find something that helps with your depression. I strongly believe that it is something that affects us ..we must all have some type of outlet that helps deal with it Hi there, in the hospital I go to in the UK I was able to get a referral from my doctor to see a psychologist about my depression. It is a service that I believe all haemophiliacs have access to. \n\nThe psychologist I saw was very good but I also paid to have private sessions as there were a lot of underlying issues which were beyond her remit to deal with. \n\nIn a nutshell however, seeing a psychologist was the single best thing I did for that stage in my life and I would wholeheartedly recommend this as an instant source of relief if things are just too much for you. Speaking to a professional and speaking to a spouse, friend, family member or colleague are worlds apart. It is not to say that your friends etc are not fantastic to speak to, it is just they have not studied the humans mind for thousands of hours so it is unlikely that they will be able to truly understand where you are coming from and what you can do to fix it.\n\nI, only now believe that depression is a lot more than your mental state which is why I would also recommend a physical activity that you can do everyday, ideally follows a routine and involves conscious breath work. For me, it is yoga. \n\nWhilst I had done yoga in the past on YouTube, actually attending classes frequently was amazing. You have a specialist teaching you for longer periods, typically 60 to 90 minutes which really gives you enough time to warm up, truly settle in and ultimately unwind. \n\nThe key here is to find a style which works for you, so go to a yoga studio where multiple styles are taught. Now, I mostly do Yin Yoga which is a slow moving and restorative yoga - this works for me because my mind is very active and the deep breathing and stretches give it and my body a momentary rest. But that is just me, you might like Ashtanga, Vinyasa, Iyengar etc...so try them all. \n\nI also 100% recommend meditation and prayer. I try to meditate daily, preferably in the morning as it is my way of controlling my internal environment directing a potential storm to somewhere where it can be beneficial for me...and keep in mind meditation does not have to be spiritual or sitting upright. No, quite the opposite. You can download an app such as Headspace or Calm where you can just simply sit down and focus on your breathing and body sensations. \nAnd yes prayer works for me, but I appreciate that not everyone resonates with this. \n\nLast but not least, a morning routine works wonders for me incorporating the above as it is my time to be with myself and to set the tone for the day. I try to wake up between 4 and 4.30 to pray, meditate and do yoga. It does not always happen this way and I do not beat myself up about it but I do feel a million times better if I follow my routine.\n\nI did say last but not least, but educating yourself about how the mind works and eating well are also beneficial.\n\nI do not suffer from depression anymore, and I do not manage depression anymore, rather I simply try to take care of myself a lot more, mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. \n\nAnyone who is out there reading this, also be careful of labels such as depression, anxiety etc. These labels give you security that something is wrong with you, but if you look at the definition of depression surely everyone at some point in their life has had  temporary moments of \u201csevere despondency and dejection...inadequacy and guilt...lack of energy and disturbance of appetite and sleep\u201d (Oxford Dictionary). So, what would happen if we used the same dictionary and associated ourselves with the definition that we want our lives to reflect?\n\nThere is a lot more I could write but I am waffling now, so happy to help anyone here with advice should they need it. Ping me a message and we can chat/call.", "V Day Update on hemophilia ", "Symptoms of Breakthrough bleeds on Hemlibra Hey guys- I was wondering what practices you hemlibra users employ when evaluating symptoms of a potential breakthrough joint bleed.  Like- toss up stage of swelling and heat or waiting until full-blown confirmation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor anyone considering- been on hemlibra a few weeks now and it is fantastic. The current concern is from over-strenuous activities while being out of shape. I follow my doctors guidance. Feel a bleeding and if after 2h it feels like it is getting worse, then injecting half a dose(NovoSeven). In 2 years so far had to do it twice. \nBoth times after half of dose, bleeding stopped and next day did not really feel like had a bleeding. Before Hemlibra bleeding meant 3 days in bed/pain. \nP.S. If you want to know more, feel free to ask here/PM. It depends if you have inhibitors or not. If no inhibitor, treat like normal. I have run into this , and it is tricky. Hemlibra has changed the game. I have both had bleeds that seemed bad stop on Hemlibra when I thought they would not, and I have had them become problems when I thought Hemlibra should have covered it. It is tricky. I treat it as if I have around 30% factor- so if that is where Hemlibra raises me to (metaphorically) then if I have an injury that 30% will not cover, I treat as usual with factor 8 to stop it. And follow the same protocol I usually did before hemlibra. Again, I have had bleeds get better before they usually would on hemlibra , and I have had bleeds take the same amount of time to heal and had to use factor every day for a while (although I eventually did not have to do as much factor during the healing process as I used to). I treat like I am not on Hemlibra if it is a serious bleed. What I do not want to happen is to assume it is being stopped and have a worse bleed than I would have (trickle) and end up with more serious long lasting swelling and joint damage. So far though , so good. It is been a little confusing but over all I am infusing about 80% less, and am way more active, so that is awesome. But yea, I get where your at. I think the standard way to treat bleeds when on Hemlibra needs to be assessed and re evaluated. Until you know, be safe and do factor. Unless you have inhibitors then I do not know. Good luck. I think things are about to get a lot better for some of us. I hope so.", "Today I am switching to a extended half-life prescription. Very excited to have less frequent injections  What a classy looking package. Like the Marlboro of factor drugs. Not speaking bad of the product but some people I know get random body aches after taking it. Just a heads up Been on it for quite a few years, loved the switch but I have noticed a spike in muscle bleeds vs joint bleeds. Good luck! I am on that one too (I am portuguese)! Did the switch since the beginning of the year. I will definitely be checking out for any weird things. I am hoping that nothing too serious happens. I appreciate the heads up. Are you talking about Hemlibra? Or Eloctate? I am on Hemlibra and the sore joints in the morning are  making me consider not using it. I wonder if Eloctate has similar side effects? Was speaking on Eloctate. So far I have heard nothing but positive about hemlibra but know very few on it. Been over a year for me (idelvyion), def a game changer. G\u2019luck! I had had used Eloctate for years, never had any issues. Hope for the same for you! Ok. Hemlibra seems to be causing sore joints / tendons(?) in the morning for me. I am looking into what to do about this. It sucks, the morning soreness (arthralgia) I mean. Other than that Hemlibra is great. I am on older product. Have plenty arthralgia on my own, glad I am not on one that causes it. Eloctate was really good for me for a year and a half. Vein scarring was my only issue. How long have you been on it? Since it was approved for the public in December of 2018. Yeah I have been on it since November. I only had the sore joints for about a month and then it all went away (apart from my normal target joint aching I get in the winter and before a thunderstorm). That is good to hear. Mine are still pretty bad in the morning, and I do not have previous arthritis. And my elbow had developed a bad case of tendonitis. I am trying to figure out what to do about it. Have you looked into physical therapy? I know it would not help the tendonitis, but it might help other areas around the joint which could ease it. Helped me out a ton. I have not been officially checked out fully, but my elbow got really bad (hence why I started prophy on Recombinant, then switched to Eloctate for the longer term, then Hemlibra due to my veins being scarred) and I went to physical therapy last year and it made all the difference. I have my first appointment in a long time tomorrow actually. So that is good to hear. I think it will help too. The extended half life Factor VIII is the real thing. Your life will be so much better now.\n\nDisclaimer: I had not used the exact same extended half life Factor VIII as the one shown in your photo. I have heard a lot about this treatment and it appears to be like prophylaxis on steroids!\n\nI have been pushing to get into a treatment like this due to my veins slowly giving up! \n\nLet me know you get on with it! I used eloctate it worked well at first then started getting spontaneous bleeds i would recommend it though 5 of my friends use it and it works well for them Hemlibra is great in my opinion just some minor muscle aches in the morning have not had a bleed with it yet", "Help me decipher this! I (33f) just got my test results back for my Von Willebrand panel, because I have been having horrible bruising since 2019 with no cause, I had to have an endometrial ablation back then because my periods were so heavy I almost needed a blood transfusion. Fast forward to now, still heavy bruising without cause, but my APTT came back elevated, so I got sent to hematology.\n\nMy factor 8  was 176%, standard range 56-140%\n\nMy Von Willebrand factor Antigen was 123%, standard range 50-200%\n\nMy Von Willebrand factor was 67%\n\nMy iron is also low 43 standard 50-170 and the % saturation was 11.3 (standard 15-45%)\n\nMy APTT ranges from 3 different tests between 40 and 43.3 seconds since February 2021.\n\nI still have a PTT 1.1 ratio test to do tomorrow.\n\nI do not see my doctor for a whole week and I am really worried about what those number mean because they do not seem good. Tbh, that looks pretty normal! \n\nI have vWD 2A (40F) - my antigen is 15%, undetectable vWf levels, F8 is ~20-25% \n\nYour APTT is a tiny bit high but not much...\n\nDid they check for fibroids? They can cause super heavy periods too? I agree, all numbers you named seem to be normal or higher than average (from what I know, I am not a doctor) where you would expect lower numbers if you were to have a bleeding disorder.\n\nThough they do not mean everything is alright, as you said you have bleeding symptoms. \n\nI would recommend two things:\n\n1. See if they have checked if your platelets are alright. If you have too little platelets or they do not work properly it is hard for blood to clot.\n2. Maybe ask for a second f8 blood test if you were stressed when the blood tests were done. When you are stressed the the levels of f8 can peak (happens to me a lot, I am afraid of needles). They also fluctuate in general.\n\nI am a carrier of haemophilia a severe and in my case first time I had a test like this I got 119% on F8 levels. Way too high for a carrier with symptoms. Since haemophilia is in my family I could get a genetics test for it which I went to get because I did not believe the results. After that test came back positive for the haemophilia gene I was tested for F8 levels again. That second time I had only 69% F8 so those values can fluctuate. I also had bad periods, bruises and occasionally nosebleeds that lasted longer than average.\n\nIf the periods persist to be bad you might want to look into taking birth control until you have other medication that can help you.\n\nI wish you the best of luck finding your condition and a solution. I hope it will not be long &lt;3 I was not stressed at all about the blood tests. Needles do not phase me and I did not actually expect my numbers to come back wonky other than my APTT which we knew about.  I was more expecting my Von Willebrand to come back weird but that report  said that was normal. I just do not know what an elevated F8 means.\n\nSo", "20 M. I have severe Hemophilia A.

Sorry, not familiar with the Ohio situation but,\n\nIf you go to an HTC already they might have a social worker that can help find you an option.\n\nYour local hemo chapter may also be able to provide some guidance on best options While GHPP is an awesome safety net, I think there is only one other state with something similar and that is NY. ( Thanks for the link mate. Really? I did not know that, that sucks. Yup, GHPP is a state funded program run by California departments of health care service. GHPP is for people older than 21, while CCS(California children's services) is basically the same thing for 21 and under.  I knew that it was fun by California, I just was not aware that other states did not have similar programs.\n\nThe more you know. Thanks Moved overseas :/ Oh really? How does it work over there?  I pay about $250/month, am 100% covered for any and all hemophilia-related issues (including surgery, of which I have had two in Japan), and get a monthly hardship stipend from the city. Whaaaa??? That is not bad! I assuming you are a citizen over there? Nope, do not want to give up my US citizenship and I have been here nearly 11 years so permanent residency is just around the corner.\n\nThen again I have not taken any factor since February b/c I am on ACE910... Wow that is great! Everyone else in the world is so far ahead of the US when it comes to treatment. And gene therapy seems to be a long way off yet.", "Hemlibra deaths? Has anyone heard or gotten more info about the deaths they talk about in this article?  I knew before taking hemlibra about the six deaths in phase 2 of trials But this article is now saying that there were four deaths last quarter and a total of 34 since fda approval. \n\nAnyone have more insight? I have a meeting with my doctor later Im worried to take another dose. Looks like a rather badly reported article to me also! I have been on Hemlibra for 3 months and without a doubt would say it is the best thing that is happened for me, no more bleeds since starting (before was at least 2 a month on average) and my target joints are all starting to feel like they did 10 years ago. \n\nFrom what I understand the deaths have been linked to incorrect use of factor to \u2018treat\u2019 bleeds and the use of Fibre (correct me on improper name of spelling).\n\nObviously I would discuss your concerns with your Hemo team to help calm your concerns, can I ask which country you are from? I thought so too but Death numbers also posted on the drug manufacturer\u2019s site as well. \n\nJust alot scarier than when I read that it was only six deaths in phase 2 trials when agreeing to make the switch First things first is to not panic or cease taking a medication or other treatment without talking to your doctor. I do not know the specifics on Hemlibra, but I know often deaths with medications are attributable to either a) allergic reactions (like many of the covid vaccine adverse events) or b) Improper use (using a maintenance medication as an emergency med, or vice versa, improper route of admnistration (Supposed to swish but you always swallow the med, diluting or not diluting the med, there are many, many wrong ways to take medications! You would be surprised how good people are at finding silly things to do!) over or under medicating, even dosing being messed up. \n\n Talk to your doctor/HTC. They will be able to help with your concerns more than random people on the Internet. They know your situation, life, and medical records better than we do. They are there to help make sure you can live your life to the fullest, and that includes talking you through fears like that.", "Proceeding With Caution? Hi everyone!! I am using a throwaway because I want to surprise my partner, but does anyone have recommendations for fun and exciting Valentine\u2019s date ideas that do not include the usual roller skating or ice skating or things like that?

My VWD really only flares up during my period. The one option I was given for treatment was hormonal birth control, but I am nearing the end of my rope with its side effects. I do not personally know any other women with the condition, so I was wondering what treatment/medications work best for fellow female redditors. Are you followed by a hemophilia treatment center? If so, what state do you live in? I work at an HTC and we have monthly girls clinics that just adresses girls needs with heavy menstrual cycles. There are several different options and other alternatives. Maybe this is availble where you live? I live in Maryland. I did not even know HTCs existed, I will look into it. \n\nI would start by contacting your state chapter. I put the link above. They should be able to connect you with the center that will best suite your needs. I would also look at the National hemophilia federation website. There is a lot of information about women living with bleeding disorders. Best of luck! Tranexamic acid might be a good choice for you. I second getting in touch with either Hemophilia Foundation of Maryland or the Hemophilia Federation of America. Stimate Weirdly, it was my neurologist (I also have epilepsy) that pointed out taking regular folic acid supplements thst would help the bleeding and cramps. When I was not taking them regularly, I was nonfunctioning the first three days of my period. Now it is bearable on the first day with some Tylenol and I barely notice it after that. The CDC has a specific site for heavy periods and for VWD. How often do you use it? Thanks, is there a brand of folic acid you recommend? My daughter is a symptomatic carrier. Stimate is a nasal spray that she takes when her period starts and then 24 hrs later. Then skip a day (or two I think) then repeat until it is through, usually a week or whatever. It is easy to take. There is a pill that goes along with it too, it is called tranexamic acid. The dr prescribed those together and it works well. It is the standard for women with Vonwillebrands or hemophilia. I get a generic brand prescribed to me, but I am sure anything over the counter would be fine as well I replied above on accident Thank you so much for this information. Does a hematologist prescribe it or an OBGYN? A hematologist, but I do not see why an OBGYN could not. It is not a narcotic or anything. Unless they just are not comfortable prescribing it. But I think the pills that go with Stimate are common for anyone with heavy periods. So maybe your OBGYN would be fine prescribing both.", "Hemophilia Hey guys.

Hey guys,\n\nI am a European with severe Hemophilia A living in the US. I am still very new to the intricalities of US insurance/healthcare. Last year, I have enrolled at Takeda copay assistance program and they have been diligently covering my monthly Advate shipment copays (about $250/mo) ever since. I went to my doctor last month and they have requested to do some blood tests (the usual set: FVIII, inhibitors, etc.) on the spot, and it turns out that my insurance plan has deductibles on lab tests done outside of my university hospital. Anyway, I now will have to pay just south of $350 for these tests.\n\nHowever, I was wondering if Takeda would be willing to cover this amount for me through the same copay assistance program? The doctor used these tests to increase my monthly dosage, so, technically, it may qualify as something related to \"prescribed hematology treatment\"?\n\nDo any of you have experience of asking your copay assistance programs (at Takeda or other manufacturers) to cover copays that are not directly related to the prescribed medication? The problem I have run into, specifically with Takeda's copay assistance program, is that it is specifically for pharmaceuticals (i.e. our advate or hemlibra, etc). I ran into a similar scenario running titers and checking inhibitor levels with significant out of pocket expenses. \n\nI instead argued with my insurance and made them at least cover it as in-network co-insurance since my in-network labs would not be able to complete similar testing in-house. Thanks, this sounds like a way to go. Last time I checked, my university hospital's lab was not able to do the inhibitor levels test, so I might indeed go your route and also ask the insurance to not apply the deductible towards these tests. Thanks for the tip! As he stated it is for the medication only, and it will not cover associated supplies either. Sad part is all the lab tests and corresponding costs used to be covered by a simple copay which was in the $25-$35 range, that all changed with the ACA restructuring insurance to all high deductible plans. \n\nIt is ridiculous that the Affordable Care Act, actually made insurance less affordable. All it did was help insurance companies and medical providers drastically increase costs. Well, it did also require all health insurance companies to cover Hemophilia treatment without pre-existing clauses. There was a hemophiliac in the room with Obama when he signed it, because of their lobbying efforts.  It was no sure thing for an insurance company to cover Hemophilia care at all before that. Most of the good ones did. But it was a choice, not a requirement. But if I understand your larger point, yeah our health care is pretty much a mess.  If they do nothing to reign in costs at the source, we will continue to suffer as much financially as we do physically. The removal of lifetime cap and pre-existing conditions were already in the works under Bush. They would have happened regardless. \n\nI am more scared of the consolidation of care to large for profit run board driven hospitals, no wording on drug price negotiations, and a huge push for high deductibles which in the government marketplace have astronomical costs compared to corporate negotiated plans. There is also a serious threat to competition in the market which also keeps prices down because of the government favoring certain insurance companies and subsidizing their costs over other providers.", "To those who have tattoos - did you have any issues with the ink/image getting distorted due to bleeding? Just like the Q says.\n\nMy dad (also a heamophiliac) has a tattoo but his became super \"blurred\" during the healing process. He seems to think this may have been due to bleeding. I just wondered if any of you had had tattoos done where this had happened? I really want to get a tattoo done for the first time but do not want to risk any smudging No issues, but my calf tattoo bled and ran ink the next day.  Not of my other tattoos did. Calf tat still looks good, no issues with distortion. All of my tattoos bled about the same as anyone else during the session No issues with mine but I infused right before and probably the next day if I recall correctly. I do not think excessive bleeding can distort the image anyway tho, so it may have been the artist \ud83d\ude2c I infused before and everything went great. Before you make an appointment I would ask your doctor what to do before the tattooing and what do after. Should not be a problem then. Infused right before, did not have any problems while, the next day, or now - many years later. Tat looks as good as it used to. My partner is a mild B hemophiliac. He has several tattoos and the ones he properly cared for afterward (the standard aftercare the artists recommend) turned out just fine and are beautiful. The ones he neglected to care for are the ones where he lost color or the lines got blurry. His hemophilia really did not affect his healing at all. Some of the tattoos he took factor ahead of time for, others he did not. That did not affect the way the tattoo turned out. Really depends on treatment before and after. Can vary depending on your regime and the quality of the artist. I have a video talking about Haemophilia and tattoos. Check out Unclottable on the socials and YouTube \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb My tattoos done on prophy days held their color much better than the one done with nothing. When it comes to tattoos and most other things the only thing that makes us unique is our factor levels. So if you keep that factor level up during the tattoo and during after care your tattoo will be just fine.\n\nFind a tattoo artist that is \u201crough\u201d they typically give solid lines deep in the skin where the inks needs to go.

Sounds like I am starting an AA meeting but... Hi my name is Thomas, and I am a hemophiliac. I am type A Severe with less than 2% active clotting. My parents found out that I had hemophilia when I was born in 1986. After my parents learned all they could about hemophilia, they dug into our family history to see where it could have came from since no one im our family tree has been a hemophiliac. Long story short it was a spontaneous mutation in the gene that made me a hemophiliac.  My current meds are Advate Factor Eight Recombinant in different dosages, like some vials are 2500IU, some are as low as 400IU. I do not prophy dose because I do not have insurance and University of Alabama Birmingham Hospital are helping with my meds and hospital costs for the time being. \n\nI live in North Alabama, and the doc's around here are pretty green on hemophilia so it is a bitch to find a good doctor without having to drive 2hrs south. I am sure like you guy's i also have target joints. Currently mine are the right ankle and my left elbow. The elbow is so badly damaged from repeated bleeds that I have lost 40 degrees of motion. Mr.Assbag right ankle as i like to call him, has gotten to the point where I can walk for 5 minutes and then starts the stabbimg pains. \n\nI try to live my life as active as possible. I hike, I play paintball, I used to skateboard.. anything dangerous a freebleeder should not do.. I totally do that shit! I am not going to sit on my ass and let hemophilia get the best of me. Sure, I have bleeds after I go hiking.. but to me its worth it. To be active with my friends.. I will take a bleed for that. Just shoot me up and swallow a few painkillers and I will be back on the trails in two or three days! So let us all get to know eachother, and share a little about our lives. If you do not want to share your life story, at least let everyone else know your hemo type or something so we can all be cool like that. \n\nPS: Apologies to the Grammar Nazis.

My personal advice is that if you are on prophylaxis then you can try it out. Just be sure to wear plenty of extra padding. Airsoft pellets move pretty quick and will leave you with a ton of welts and bruises if you are not carful. Hi, also severe A here. I have never done airsoft but I used to go paintballing all the time. I would definitely recommend infusing beforehand. That is what I always did and never had a problem. Now I do competitive sword fighting and it is the same deal :) I am a mild and I used to do paintball without an issue and no treatment beforehand. I just always wore clothing that was on the thicker side and no exposed skin. You should be alright if you dress accordingly and infuse beforehand. Infuse first, always wear eye protection, never point your gun at anyone who is not playing and wearing protection, and kick some ass! If you can afford it make sure you get all metal guns.

My ankles are my target joints, soon my orthopaedic says that i will need an ankle fusion, has anyone been through this procedure? I would like to hear frome people before going through with it... dude i would not get that once that happens there will be nothing you will be able to reverse it, where are you from? I have arthritis in my ankle and I got an shot for arthritis that helped a bit. I do not think you should do fusion! If new technology comes out I doubt they would be able to fix it when its fused. you wont be able to move your ankles at all. also i would make a better title, something about fusing ankles at 16 Yeah... i thought about that... the pain is so bad though... its been a couple months that i have not got a good night of sleep... i think im going insane... i cant do physio because my ankles are too damaged, i dont have any cartilage left and the accumulation of senovium is severe... the surgeon told us that they have not made any significant advance in ankle replacement in 50 years... i dont know what to do... Hello! I am a 24 year old type A Mild to Moderate. I had an ankle fusion done a few days before I turned 18 (my surgeon likes to brag I am the youngest he is ever performed the procedure on). \n\nWhen I was very young my first hemorrhage was in my left ankle. I continued to have bleeds in that joint very frequently throughout my life. Around 14, I finally got an MRI on the ankle and they found what was likely an inital birth defect and deterioration of the ankle. The birth defect caused hemorrhages and the hemorrhages caused further deterioration. This caused intense debilitating pain up until I had the ankle fusion.\n\nI had a de-brievement done on the ankle when I was 16, but in the end there was no pain relief and frequent hemorrhages continued. During this time I wore stabilizing brace on my leg to help support my ankle. This brace prevented really any motion in my ankle when it was on.\n\nAfter the last surgery failed to provide relief, we went with the ankle fusion. My logic was that I was already in too much pain to do anything and had completely restricted motion of my ankle joint, so I might as well do the surgery.\n\nThe ankle fusion was the best decision I ever made. I had less pain from the entire recovery process than before, taking no painkillers compared to the almost daily doses before the operation. Once fully recovered, I had zero pain and have had zero hemorrhages since. I can run for the most part, ride bikes, and nobody can tell I have anything wrong with my stride (unless I am barefoot).\n\nThe only downsides are that I have a hard time engaging my left calf muscle when working out and it is noticeably smaller than my right, although it was atrophied way before the surgery. As mentioned before, walking barefoot is a little difficult and my toes start to hurt if I wear less-than-perfectly comfortable shoes. I also seem to have a harder time balancing overall and occasionally lose my footing if I have to rely only on that foot.\n\nAfter getting the procedure, I would not be too worried if I found out I had to get the procedure on my other ankle as well under similar circumstances. I hope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions! Wow, this brougt tears to my eyes... i cant imagine being releived of all that pain \ud83d\ude22 if i would do it, it would need to be on both ankles because both are equally deteriorated... but hearing from people who got the surgery done and dont regret it takes a bit of my fear away, thank you I also have severe hemophilia a and I had problems with my right ankle.  I was able to get a radiosynovectomy when I was 12 years old (30 now) and I have not had a spontaneous bleed in my ankle since. I have hit my ankle and had a bleed but with no blunt trauma I am good.  My ankle will still get sore when I am on it a lot like at concerts or theme parks (I do give myself factor before) but it goes away within a day or 2. I would say ask about that. I live in Southern California so not sure if that would be available where you live.\n\n My orthopaedic said it was to late for that... it would of been an option before my ankle became this bad but now its already too far gone...i wish i would of knew before it got to this point... oh damn dude i cant run now, your convincing me of getting it done. I miss working out. The way they described it to me sounded way worse. dude these other guys have given me hope that its not that bad. It sounded horrible the way they described it to me. If you are hurting that bad I would go for it! Do what your heart tells you! Do not live in pain!\n\n&amp;#x200B; Thanks man \ud83d\ude42 Do you get throbbing pain in your ankles all the time, or only at the end of the day after walking them?\n\nMy pain has been manageable, so I am getting orthotics to let me walk better with less pain. ExoSym, or the cheaper Toe-Off. They restrict your ankle from bending, take some weight off your ankle, and translate striking your heel on the ground in to forward motion.\n\nBoth of my ankles are pretty much gone and have always been my target joints, but I guess inactivity and early prophy trials has left my pain manageable at the age of 28 with Severe. I did have surgery on the Left ankle, a synovectomy and removing bone spurs.\n\nI normally hear folks saying they wish they had done Fusion earlier, despite the pain of recovery. So if your ortho is pushing for a fusion now, you probably really need it.\n Yeah, my pain is non-stop, havent been to school in 2 weeks. Even when im not walking on them it hurts... from the replys i got on this i think ill go for the fusion... Good luck! Basically no reason not to if the pain is that bad. Ankle Fusions can be reversed nowadays, so it really is not a permanent procedure. Fusing the ankle puts extra stress on the foot joints to compensate that loss of motion, so if the arthritis spreads to your foot and gets bad enough, they can un-fuse the ankle, fuse the foot, and look at other Ankle solutions. Great info thanks. I am in a similar situation. Your story is very similar to mine. My Orthopedic surgeon wants me to consider an ankle replacement or a fusion. I am currently managing my pain with steorid injections, Tramadol and ankle braces bit a surgery is well overdue.\n\nI was all set for the fusion but now that the idea of the replacement has been introduced I am a bit confused.\n\nI have not heard too many negative fusion stories, but quiet a few negative ankle replacement stores. ( Just out of curiosity which centre do you attend?\n\nI was told the ankle replacements have improved recently but because the ankle is much more complex than the knee there is more deterioration therefore requiring further surgery within 5 to 8 years. \n\nI too am in urgent need of a fusion or replacement but finding it hard to commit. I attend the IWK in Halifax, NS, CA. I wish i could get a replacement but i was told it wasnt available for me... Oh wow! I didnt know you could unfuse a joint!! That Is great news! Often when you get to the stage that you need a fusion your ankle movement is minimal because of the level of pain you are in. \n\nI am in need of a surgical intervention because of the pain. When I walk I basically self fuse my ankle and keep everything tense to avoid moving across any of the bone nodules that case pain. \n Ah, I am in the UK so not sure what the differences in terms of surgical procedures are. I almost feel like the replacement is being pushed on me but the thought of having to get it done again. In 6 years is a real turn off. I am.leanong towards fusion. Same for me they told me ankle replacement would not last long enough to be worth it.. Good luck. Read my sports tape post and see if there is anything there you can use.  Thabk you, i can try but i doubt it will do much. My pain is mostly from arthritis, not from bleeds. But I will give it a try thanks :) I am on ACE910 now but I used to tape up my ankles when I  knew that I would have to do a lot of walking.  Yeah, that would of been a good idea to prevent damge but my ankles are already detroyed, no more cartilage and i have big holes in my bones Ouch  Yeah... that is why im considering fusion... I know nothing about it but, before you reach a decision, you need to know as much, if not more, about joint fusion than the doctor who suggested it. Read as much as you can find on the subject and talk to as many people as possible. Educate yourself. \n\nThey wanted to fuse my right knee at one point but I refused; which is just as well because I managed to rehabilitate it with gym. It still does not extend fully but at least I can bend it when I walk. If they had fused it, I would not be able to bend it at all. \n It just sucks... it feels like its my only option and i cant do anything about it... my ankles started deteriorating at a very young age and i did not understand what it meant.... i did not take care of my ankles and now im stuck... i try to talk with people but not many 16 year olds have severe arthritis in both ankles... from what I have seen from people i talked with here it seems like fusion is not that bad but im still scared... Do not blame yourself. You are just unlucky. By the time I was in my teens, I had had (what felt like) a million ankle bleeds and my ankles were nowhere near as bad as yours. You just have to hack it any way you can and not beat yourself up when things go sideways. Cut yourself a whole heap of slack. You must have noticed by now that everyone is story is  different: so different that it is hard to believe we have the same problem. All any of us can do is own it and you are already doing that. Believe me, you are not missing out on anything you will not be able to catch up on later. \n\nDoes anything hurt more than ankle bleeds though? They suck so loudly you want to go out and buy ear plugs. Not  elevating them hurts. Elevating them hurts even more. And if your toes so much as graze the ground it is like a five-alarm fire siren went off in your head.  Thank you so much.. i really needed that.. its rare to find people that understand me, that is why i love this thread. Thanks for the advices :) You are welcome \u263a Sorry for the late reply! I completely forgot to mention what range of motion I still had.\n\nMy surgeon told me I would only have about 20 degrees of motion after the procedure due to the range of motion attributed to the other bones in my foot.\n\nBefore the surgery, that was really the only place I frequently got hemorrhages without cause. Sorry for the late reply! I have been in the process of moving. I would love to hear an update, I am glad I could help. I was in a similar situation, getting injections regularly.\n\nMy surgeon proposed the option of a replacement, but his logic was it will need to be replaced much sooner than a fusion might need to be re-examined (he said, confidently, it should last around 60 years). \n\nI would love to hear any updates! Until my girlfriend showed me this post, I had not considered other hemophiliacs might have gone through this situation. I had not heard you could reverse fusions, that is amazing. Maybe in the future, a replacement might be a more viable option for me.\n\nMy toes have experienced what you describe. They are more arthritic than ever before, although I am trying types of shoes I never would have worn before. It might be time to switch back to New Balance for me. Nothing new... i missed 30 days of school since february... im getting kind of mad my nurse at the IWK(the hospital where i go) is waiting to get all my appointments (ortho, pain clinic, hematologist) on one date but she cant find a date so i cant see my orthopedic surgeon and the pain is driving me crazy!!

Few weeks ago, my blood test revealed that my V and my X factor were low ( 40 an 30) when the others were at 70 instead of 100-90 the doctor said. I thought it was, you know, temporary until yesterday when my mother took a blood test with the X factor low. \nSo, it is hemophilia. The odds were of 1/1 000 000 for each disease. I am trying to hide my feelings but like I am really sad. For a little scar of 1 millimetre, I bleed for 20 minutes. The other factors are a bit low. \nI really do not know what to do, so advices are welcomed There is nothing to worry about. This is 2019 not 1985. Hemophilia treatment is extremely advanced and as long as you keep up with your factor treatments (as recommended by your Hematologist) you should live a long normal life. Welcome - we are very inviting. First things first - find a competent provider. Once there, do your own research and stay up to date with your information. You are your own best advocate. \n\nNow that the provider things are taken care of.... RICE is your best friend:\n\nR - rest, respect your body and understand that you do not heal like others (ego check)\n\nI - ice the area, 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off. \n\nC - compression\n\nE - elevation (if lower extremity, keep it elevated and weight off of it)\n\nLike /u/shaza15 said, this is 2019 not 1985. Your quality of life will be minimally reduced if you adhere to the treatment plan that works for you. Do not ignore small bleeds - those accumulate and become larger problems.

I take the medicine every other day and wondering if the day i dont have it i can squat heavy. Ty in advance. Once again, talk to your Hemophilia treatment center. No one here knows the condition of your joints or your factor levels. This one you should be fine, as long as you are actually only supposed to take medicine every other day you should not have to worry about the off days when it comes to general exercise like weighted squats. \n\nOf course check with your doctor, but if you are responsible and do not ever miss a dose you should be fine. Happy lifting! Are you new to squats or just curious about the days you do not factor up? If your infusing every other day, you still want to take your metabolism into consideration and that of the half life of your factor product dropping 8 hours or so after administering on infusion days. Leaving your body the most vulnerable on that between day of you dosing up. As a severe A, I would recommend squats and heavy lifting on days you do factor, not on the days in between when your body is the most vulnerable. Just my personal opinion but I would consult your Hemotology team first just to be safe No joint damages and factor levels are normal U to! That Is what i was thinking. Also i squat alot. Ty Ya, I would take serious precautions then. You do not want a bleed in the areas those squats are targeting then an additional bleed in a random area the blood will travel to- through the affected areas valley's/plains when the blood has nowhere to go as in- in the outer hip region or lower inner glute area, that will cause a double whammy, no body wants! Ty. Ill go really light none medicine days In addition to other advice, you could do your heavy squats, then see how it affects you for a few days without adding any other unusual strain. Everybody's different, so you can only prepare then find out. Unfortunately that could affect your routine, but sounds like you are more in-tune with your body than myself and others. I feel fine after squats. Never felt any pain That is good. Just be careful, since major joint bleeds have a tendency to turn in to lifelong recurring problems. But your future self will thank you for building up that muscle! I am always scared of having a joint bleed. Can you feel it? Alot? Like idk but the closest ive felt to a bleed i think is when i ran 5 miles and my right shin hurt a bit. Like it was a bit inflamed but that is the most \u201cinside bleed\u201d ive felt. Idk if you are suppose to feel it though I also have hemophilia A severe and I work out as much as I want, regardless of my infusing schedule. That being said, I do not heavy squat, although, I do squat. Before doing anything you should definitely consult with your treatment center and hematologist, but I would say as long as you follow the regular safety precautions of working out ie. having a spotter, and do not overdo it, you should be fine. That being said you should still look out for bleeds and talk to your hematologist.

Nice. Ty for your insight bro", "Olympic Hopeful with Hemophilia ", "Anyone else weirded out meeting fellow bleeders IRL? As a kid growing up, I was usually the only hemophiliac in the oncology wing, and over the years I had less than a handful encounters with other hemophiliacs at my local children's hospital. One of my uncles has the same deal, but overall I have always had this Highlander-esque \"There can be only one!\" thing going on when it comes to meeting other bleeders. I suppose since I have never let just my hemophilia define who I am, it can be awkward meeting someone strictly based on the context that we both share a bleeding disorder. I mean if we have absolutely nothing else in common, it is nearly guaranteed to be quite awkward. It is easier for me to meet, say, someone who owns a dog or plays guitar since those things really play a large role on my personality. When it comes to your own care, hemophilia can definitely be an island, particularly if your HTC/hematologist is attached to an oncology center and if you are not involved with a local chapter or camp.  But here is the reality (in my opinion, anyway)...whether you know it or not, you are part of a fairly large brotherhood of badasses.  We share the common experience of bleeding, and like /u/viceroe says, we do not let it define us, but we do have a common bond.  We know about ER visits and arrogant doctors and dashed sports dreams and iliopsoas bleeds and blown/scarred veins and maybe HCV/HIV and all the other bullshit that comes with the territory.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to embrace the hemophilia community, I have found that these common experiences forge a foundation for friendship that can be stronger than anything you are likely to experience outside of hemophilia.  At the very least, when you meet another hemo, you know that you have that...at least...in common.  Are there awkward bleeders?  For sure!!  But our commonality of experience is a starting point that you do not often get when meeting other people for the first time.\n\nMy completely unsolicited advice is to give the community a shot.  There are a ton of opportunities to interact with other blood brothers, like attending a local chapter event or a ( meeting or one of the national events like the HFA symposium (( or the NHF annual meeting ((  At the very least, I promise no one will try to cut your head off and scream \"THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!\" Love this advice and it is all so true! I will add that its actually great for the whole family to be involved and part of the community. One of the kindest and most supportive groups. My brother has hemophilia and I am an intern at my local chapter, if you have got any questions or just want to talk about getting involved in the community feel free to message me!  Nope not at all, I grew up and live in the greater Los Angeles area. There are a lot of us living her, however I do not think I have ever just ran into someone I know or met a random on the street, but the hemophilia foundation for Southern California has done a good job of bringing the community together with different engagements. I think the biggest reason I do not share that feeling is Hemo summer camp which I attended from age 7 to 18.  Nope, I have an older brother and a younger cousin who also have hemophilia.\n\nI have also met other people with it. It is fun talking to them, knowing their stories and exchanging tips on first aids and how to deal with hemophilia. It is good when the conversation steers away from hemophilia and just knowing them as a person.  I was like that to an extent at one point. I had been to summer camp as a kid, but quit going around junior high. I was never around any hemophiliacs or involved in any meetings again until after I graduated college. It was awkward at first. Then I got to know some of the guys. Even found out a few of us had been to the same college at the same time and had some mutual friends. Its beneficial and we do not always talk hemophilia when we run into each other.\n\nI also highly agree with the statement to not let your hemophilia define you and your life. The other guys that have it have regular lives to they just happen to have had hemophilia also. Its been over 20 years since I have met another hemophiliac in person. I had a good chuckle for some reason. I kind of hate it. I am radically different to each and every one I have met in that I am not careful, I am not worried about my health every minute of every day, I give no thought to my Hemophilia at all nor the damages I have accrued over 32 years.\n\nI just want to scream in their faces \"Are you your condition or is there an actual person rattling around in there somewhere?!\"\n\nIf I were to meet a hemophiliac today I would play \"Compare damages\" for five minutes and then go out and have a drink together while talking about everything that is not Hemophilia.", "Help!!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I am having severe *bleeding*. I do not know what to do. It is gone on for months. I am on Humate-P and TXA. My NP is a ditz. The humate only works for the day after but then it starts back up again severely. I am also having major cramping that makes me want to do an at-home hysterectomy. I get humate infusions on Tuesdays and fridays. I am extremely depressed. I am ruining my clothes. I can barely walk when I am cramping. I am using more toilet paper then the combined amount bought by Americans at the start of the pandemic. I am also on norethindrone, danazol, lupron, gabapentin, celecoxib, midol, Tylenol, and other meds irrelevant to this. Please help me. I need advice. I would change my hematology provider but ur really not supposed to when ur in the midst of a bleeding crisis.\n\nFor reference I have VWD and I am FTM trans so plz use male pronouns and do not use the *P-WORD* in the comments Go to the ER immediately if you are currently going through bleeding! Put an ice pack on the injured area/s on the ride over to help slow the bleeding. Just let them know your conditions and they will be able to help a lot better than us! \n\nAlso, sounds like your bleeding medication may not be working for your conditions. I would talk to your care provider about switching to a different care plan/ medication ASAP. Goodluck and chin up! We are all in this together. Thank you but I do not see the purpose of going to the ER. They would just either give me humate or DDAVP and my NP refuses to let me have DDAVP. Also I argue with her nearly every day because she does not listen to me. I legit know more about vwd than she does. I keep trying to switch treatment methods but she just says no no no no no no no Important disclosure: Not a doctor, take anything I say more as a list of things I would discuss with a hematologist to get answers.\n\nI googled to see if any meds you are using are NSAID's as these medications usually are anti-coagulants, which is bad for us bleeders.\n\nWhat I found is that Celecoxib is one of those. Midol also contains NSAID in the form of Ibuprofen.\n\nLupron and Gabapentin does not seem relevant to bleeds.\n\nNow here is where it gets interesting. You are FTM so I suppose that is the reason you are taking Danazol and Norethindrone, the purpose here is to chemically induce menopause? I am not really sure here but is not menstruation extra heavy the last few times before menopause is over? Could that be it, if the heavy bleeds you are having are menstrual (not otherwise external or internal), is because of this?\n\n\nKeep the Humate-P and TXA treatment of course, those definitely should be helping. Hi! Uterus haver with vwd 2B. Lupron injections have completely terminated my cycle and ovulation. It was given to me to stop ovarian cysts and my menstration. I am cis so I have add back estridol patches. \n\nI also take 1g - 3g of Amicar daily for incidental bleeding (nose bleeds / bruising - etc). DDAVP sadly is not compatible with my type of VWD. Like another commenter mentioned - make sure none of your medications have NSAIDS. Also make sure you are looking closely at any supplements you might be taking - so frequently people conversationally recommend things that have anticoagulant properties (turmeric being one of them). \n\nAnyway - personally I would go to the ER for an infusion because it is sad and hard to be incapacitated this way. I am sorry you are experiencing it. Hey brother, sorry to read about the troubles you are having. Please bare with me here. There is quite a few things to unpack, research, reference, and organize for you.\n\nOk, my assumption from your post is that your bleeding is directly related to menstrual bleeding and is not injury related. I am going to go forward from here with that assumption. If I am wrong then I do absolutely apologize if I have just made you pointlessly uncomfortable. \n\nSo first... if NP is short for Nurse Practitioner let me start by saying that a N.P. should not be managing your hemophiliac care. They are amazingly skilled and educated individuals and I do not want to discredit them in any way... Having said that however our conditions are fairly rare and even most of the Hematologists in the world will not actually ever see a hemophiliac in a clinical setting. You really and truly need a Hematologist who specializes in our conditions. Hopefully you can find a Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) near you and get in to clinical care with a real hematologist. Many HTCs may also have resources and information for you, and even for your General Care Provider that can help them better treat you and your VWB. Many have specialists that they coordinate care with and those relationships will only benefit you as well. If you do not mind sharing a state or country location I am certain someone, possibly even myself, can help you locate a Treatment Center near you.\n\nOk, next. As far as medications go... Full disclosure I have ZERO experience with medications such as lupron and danazol. Without knowing more I cannot weigh in on these in any regard really. From what I am reading I understand danazol is often prescribed to FtM individuals to suppress or completely stop menstruation as part of transition. If that is the reason you are taking it and you are having these kinds of issues with bleeding and cramping it is possible something is not going according to plan. I do want to say that I did find two references to Danazol and bleeding. The first is in a paper about the known interaction between Danazol and warfarin where it mentions that Danazol may have a direct but thus far unknown effect on coagulation systems in the body.\u00b9 The second is in a paper specifically regarding hemophiliacs and Danazol where it notes that bleeding actually seemed to increase in 4 the 6 studied patients.\u00b2  This seems to me to DEFINITELY be a thing to talk to a medical professional about. \n\nAs for the other medications you listed I see some issues, related and not related. Firstly, Midol contains an NSAID, chiefly Naproxen. Naproxen is both a Cox-1 and a Cox-2 inhibitor and has an effect on how we form platelets\u00b3. This can significantly increase bleeding in individuals such as us. You are also taking Celecoxib and as far as I am aware this should not be used in conjunction with any other NSAID. This combination should be discussed with a Hematologist. At an absolute MINIMUM have a conversation with a legitimate Pharmacist about complications. Both together could potentially DRASTICALLY increase your chance of gastrointestinal bleeding and that is an absolute nightmare scenario for us. Midol also contains acetaminophen. Tylenol is acetaminophen as well. Many people seem entirely unaware of precisely how dangerous Tylenol can be. It is metabolized almost exclusively in the liver and Tylenol over dosing can cause permanent, severe and even fatal liver damage. It is so easy to do in fact that the FDA recently forced a lowering of the labeled maximum daily dose from 8000mg to 6000mg to help prevent dangerous over consumption.\u2074 Acetaminophen is the number one cause of acute liver failure in the United States.\u2075 \n\nUnfortunately like I said above without knowing where you are in transition or having a more complete picture of your current medical care I cannot say too much. It is true that switching providers during a bleeding episode can be bad but if you are receiving ineffective care it may be necessary. It is also possible to call and obtain a consultation without actually switching your doctor completely. There are many options. But most important is that you get the care you need. It sounds like your current prophylactic regimen is not cutting it man. It is entirely possible that you need additional dosing to combat episodic bleeding. As far as I know we all do. Especially in the face of this bleeding issue. I hate to say this because it can be such a sensitive subject but it is possible that if you are not already you may need gynecological care as well. \n\nThe long and short of all of this is that you NEED to get in better contact with a GOOD and properly equipped provider. No one here can give you better advice than that. I am happy to help you locate better care in any way I can. \n\n(Again, I am terribly inexperienced with Trans people and trans issues. I support you, I do. I am just very inexperienced. If I said or did something that made you uncomfortable, caused dysphoria, or was otherwise shit please let me know. (Or maybe direct me to a resource that might help me learn.) Lol. I want to learn how to but opportunities to interact and learn seem fairly rare for me.) \n\n\n\u00b9\n\n\u00b2\n\n\u00b3\n\n\u2074\n\n\u2075 Not a doctor:\n\nCelecoxib is a form of NSAID, but it is a different mechanism than Ibuprofen. Celecoxib, also known as celebrex, is a cox-2 inhibitor and has a lower bleeding profile/more tolerable GI side effects thereby low risk for bleeders like ourselves. However, it can cause problems with the heart, so it is typically not prescribed in the US. \n\nOP, your problems are too complex to get any meaningful advice from Reddit. You need to go to the ER if you are having continued uncontrollable bleeding. Your NP sounds like an idiot, for lack of a more appropriate term, and I would fire them immediately so you can get adequate care. Preferably one that is more receptive and understanding about being trans as it sounds like your medications may be a factor. If you are actively bleeding you need to be seen by a healthcare provider. Is there someone that you trust more than your hem NP? Maybe whoever is overseeing the medical side of your transition? Maybe they can help you advocate for better care. My guess (as a non-physician, so please take this with a GIANT grain of salt) is that your VWF levels are dropping low enough to allow bleeding between doses. Perhaps your prophy schedule needs to change. I wonder if someone can work with you to find out what your VWF kinetics look like, meaning how long it takes for the amount of Humate-P in your system to be used up.  I am sorry that you are going through all of this. Having a uterus is the worst as a cis-female. I cannot imagine being a man and having to deal with all of this. Jesus Chris I am sorry I really do not have anything to add but I am very interested how the disorder works with the transition. Definitely seek a doctor ASAP to just be safe hope all it well with you  man . Keep us updated One thing is that I get more vascular so my bleeding gets worse in general. Also study\u2019s show that some trans guys develop cramps only after starting testosterone and of course that happened to me. Thank you. I will have to try and encourage my NP to do that Yes, I am talking about menstrual bleeding.\n\nI agree that I should not have an NP, I should have a hematologist. The thing is, I go to Boston Children\u2019s hospital, aka the best children\u2019s hospital in the world, and I see the NP out of the hematology clinic. The hospital themselves must know what they are doing or they would not receive that title. I have an ACO insurance plan so all my care is coordinated with my PCP.\n\nI started the danazol after the bleeding started to try and suppress it and it has yet to work. That study is concerning and I will be sending it to my GYN because she prescribes the danazol.\n\nI am not sure what midol you are talking about but my midol contains acetaminophen, caffeine, and an antihistamine. I do not take NSAIDS besides celecoxib which does not promote bleeding.\n\nYou did great and did not cause dysphoria lol thanks\n\nI need to switch providers ASAP, I just need to go about it in the right way. I will have to ask my hematologist to make my humate 3x a week instead of 2.\n\nThanks for the advice Thanks You are correct. My NP actually prescribed the celecoxib\n\nAnd yes, she is an idiot The danazol and norethindrone is not to create menopause. Just to suppress bleeding. My midol does not contain NSAIDs. I am not sure where everyone is hearing this from.\n\nThanks There are treatments specific to menstrual bleeding, please contact a hematologist if your nurse is not helping. You must get in with an HTC!! ASAP!! My friend: please PM me and I will help you! You need to be infusing HumateP every 12 hours and a mega dose of TXA. You deserve better!!! Your dosing of HumateP should be adjusted too.   No one should have to deal with this!! Your NP does not know what they are doing\u2026. Please let us connect you with an HTC!!

And thank you in advance! :) That women can also be diagnosed with hemophilia. That inhibitors are something to be taken seriously and handled with the care and attention they deserve. That patients deserve the guidance to chose the drug that truly works for them, not the drug that was most effectively marketed by a rep buying mom or dad a steak dinner. First this is great! Glad you are doing this. Secondly, I think you should not only talk about the technical side of things but also how hemophilia can impact a persons life. Especially when it comes to constant bleeds that can really slow us down. Also how even though we may look and interact just fine, does not necessarily mean we are doing good. If I have learned anything, hemophiliacs are some pretty tough people and it takes a lot to slow down a bleeder. If we say something hurts, it probably hurts a lot to a person without hemophilia. Just my 2 cents. Thanks Op for this opportunity to share with you and your class, cheers! Oh one more thing, a spontaneous bleed can really kill social plans instantly which can suck at times lol \"So in conclusion, people with Hemophilia are not that much different than you or me. Except that their fragility makes them better. More valuable. Like a Faberge Egg.\" Hemophilia is an odd situation for me. (18F) Growing up, I knew my dad had severe hemophilia. And he was so angry about it because all his life people would tell him that he could not do normal things (for example, playing dodgeball in fourth grade) because they were scared he would get bleeds. He refuses to tell employers because if they know he was a medical liability they are way less likely to take him on and they get all weird. \n\nThen I grow up and am told that the doctors are figuring out new things all the time because this is the first time that hemophiliacs are actually living long enough to have issues. My dad's friend (a hemophiliac) had a blood clot that gave him a stroke and doctors were baffled. I am put into a study and when I go to blood clinic every year where they try different meds on me to see what I could use to save my life if I ever get into a life threatening situation. I have to carry around a card that lists my clotting factor and what /might/ save me in the event of. Well. Me bleeding out. I am put on birth control because my doctor does not know how to help me with random abdominal pain I have and I find out that I have been anemic for more than a year. I have severe joint pain in my knees (way more than an 18 year old should have) and I am always slightly concerned that any inexplicable pain in having is a sign that I am dying that doctors have not discovered yet.\n\nWhat really worries me is thinking about my future. I have always dreamed of being a mother. That was literally my only plan for the future. And then I find out that because I have hemophilia there is a 50/50 chance that if I have a son, he will face the same problems as my dad did. I struggle with the thought of having to give my son treatments and watch him go through the pain that my family does on the daily. \n\nI will admit, I do not know much about the scientific side of my own blood disease.

I keep seeing ads for PicnicHealth on Facebook promising the exciting opportunity to share your medical data with reseachers for free! Ok enough sarcasm. Obviously if they are offering it to us for free it is because they are making money off our data.

Basically a way to get around HIPAA and consent laws.  You have already given your data voluntarily to this group, and consented to let them hunt down any you have not.

I have seen a pattern that when ever there was a big event coming up, I would most certainly get a bleed at that time. \nOr is this just kind of like a placebo? Same. I just chalked it up to luck. Bleeds cause anxiety. And when I am having a bleed and I do not realize it yet I get anxious, then realize I am bleeding. I have learned to recognize that feeling now and most of the time can catch the bleed before it gets bad. Maybe you are doing a lot to get prepared for the big event to cause a small bleed before the event? Also a bunch of tiny bleeds or bruises will use up my \u201cless than 1%\u201d so I will bleed way easier if I get bumped around or over due it at all. This was my experience for a long time until I started being more intentional about thinking ahead for my prophy. I have been afforded a lot of flexibility in my treatments, so leading up to big events (traveling for work, vacation, etc.) I just did my best to ensure that I was treating right before travel and prepared to emergency dose if necessary.\nI do think there is something to be said about life (in this case big events) getting in the way of being thoughtful/careful of taking care of yourself leading up to events that otherwise occupy some amount of your brainspace as well. Yes, anxiety can cause bleeds. It definitely happens to me. Anxiety affects your whole body. In short, yes. This ( relates to von Willebrands, but there is some crossover. Read toward the bottom from discussion down (or the whole thing, up to you). \n\nIn my experience, I can say stress and anxiety was not helpful to bleeding episodes with severe F:VIII deficiency and VWF. Stay up to date on prophylaxis. Oh, interesting! Sufficiently high levels of stress and anxiety have been clinically proven to effect the way the body heals. They have also been shown to increase the rates of injury and illness in general. It is not outside of reason to imagine that these would extend to us in a capacity that could affect our bleeding. Maybe not the severity but possibly the frequency. I do not think so, I am severe A and even when I am going through some stuff I have never experiences such things.\nEven more, my favourite thing to do when I am stressed is sports, and even when I am constantly full of bruises, not even the combination of both make me bleed.\nBut I am 15 and always had a proper treatment, which obviously has a huge impact in my life quality, tho. I cannot say stress causes bleeds, but I certainly seem more susceptible to bleeds during times of high stress.  I am convinced there is a correlation. I think I have experienced the same. I would say it is a combination of stress increasing your metabolism (thus dropping your levels over time), and being more inwardly focused and focusing on the pain. \n\nI do not get too many bleeds these days, but have a ton of joint and back pain from injuries built up over the years. Hard to distract myself from it, especially if you are trapped in your mind like with anxiety. Absolutely! Stress and anxiety definitely cause bleeds absent trauma. That is especially true for target joints in those with severe Hemophilia. I have lost count...\ud83d\ude12 I am glad you (reading between the lines) have always had access to safe factor and have been able to infuse to prevent bleeds (and the arthritis that comes with repeated bleeds). Younger Hemophiliacs are very fortunate in that regard!\n\nThose of us who did not developed weak target joints that can literally bleed from sleeping wrong or even just the jolt of a hard sneeze. \ud83d\ude12 I used to love playing sports and other outdoor activities.

Am 17 and just curious. 80% of my shots are around there. I change it by centimeters somtimes  Hey Man, Idk what country you from, but I can recommend you a gel which will seriously help you. It is called \u201cthrombophob\u201d it is easily available at any chemist shop. Not expensive at all. Apply it every day. Although not immediately after injecting. What it does is it prevents blood clots which sounds totally wrong I know for us but applying it only to the affected area will help in faster healing. After we inject in the same spot for long small clots start forming which is what you have there. \n\nJust go for this gel. If you need more help just PM. Cheers! Hi thanks. I saw this one article tho that said if u inject in same vein for to much it will collapse. Am i near that? I am the same, 90% of the shots are around a single area and I apply thrombophob, still the different coloured skin scares me. Dam bro im freakin out for a bit. It happes rarely but i just injected and it was hard to puncture the vein to get into it it make a small sound and felt like i was trying to go through rubber. Man that makes me feel uneasy Do not worry, if you like inject every day then it is a problem. Try to find another area to inject. But man do apply the cream. It shows results in 2-3 days. You will feel great. I can relate, try to get thrombophob and apply it everyday, rub in circular motions gently and let it absorb and you will be fine That is the biggest danger is getting enough scar tissue that you cannot push through. I am just a few years older than you but I have been infusing in the same arm since I was 12. I try to move up or down the vein a little to spread out the damage. Ask your hematologist about it, they may recommend you alternate between arms or in your hand.\n\n As far as veins collapsing, I am no doctor but I think that is usually more of a concern for people who are injecting drugs like heroin, not hemophiliacs injecting clotting factor. I could be misinformed though. Ty The different coloration is a combination of scar tissue and \"Hemosiderin.\" When blood leaks out into our bodies, such as through injury or in this case leaking from an injection our bodies break it down. The hemaglobin in blood is broken down into bilirubin which is yellowish in color. Normally this is done in the liver when red blood cells down in our circulatory system. It is actually a part of why human feces is brown. We excrete that bilirubin as waste in our stool. When this occurs outside the liver, such as at your injection site, that bilirubin is then broken down further into Hemosiderin, which is brown. Our bodies do not process that Hemosiderin very well, or very quickly. As I understand it it can take much longer to break down and sometimes our bodies just cram it into nearby tissues. Given enough blood, or enough repeat bleeds in an area and it will actually stain the skin brown. So, the pinkness of that area is largely due to increasing scar tissue. \n\nOn vein damage and collapsed veins: from a couple of clinical websites regarding repeated intravenous injection...\n\n\"Smaller veins may collapse as a consequence of too much suction being used when pulling back against the plunger of the syringe to check that the needle is in the vein. This will pull the sides of the vein together and, especially if they are inflamed, they may stick together causing the vein to block.\"\n\n\"A collapsed vein is a blown vein that has caved in, which means that blood can no longer flow freely through that vein. Blood flow will resume once the swelling goes down. In the meantime, that vein cannot be used. If the damage is severe enough, a collapsed vein can be permanent.\"\n\n\"Treatment for collapsed veins is often simply a matter of using a little common sense. Stop injecting into the same vein; this allows time for the vein to heal and helps prevent further damage. There are also certain vitamins and supplements that can help treat inflamed veins.\"\n\nRegarding this I would say, for myself, I have two or three \"favorite spots\" I like to use for injection and typically rotate between the three. If you stop using that site the vein will heal and the brown discoloration will eventually disapate. The scar tissue will remain though. If you were to ask for a recommendation I would suggest finding one or two other locations that you can become comfortable with and rotate your injection sites. \n\nBest of luck. I changed my shot site a couple years ago, but im fixing to start hitting a new vein again. If you are ever concerned about whether you are hitting one vein too much, it is never a bad idea to change it up. Ty You can remove these spots by small local surgery. They can cut it out. I had one removed from left arm few years ago. What gauge butterfly needle do you use? Small grey ones Hi! I am 33, severe A, and have been using the same vein my entire life with no issues. Occasionally I switch arms, but prob 90% in the same spot. I do have really big veins tho, so that might be why haha. I would not worry too much :) It would be more useful to know the actual gauge of the needle, not the color. Be carefull plz. I injecting like 5 times in one arm and end with blood, i bleed like for 8 hours(sorry bad english) Gauges are color-coded, I think gray is 27g. Well come to the club, it is a right of passage, have the same scar on my right AC vein. Used it for 30 years now Try the back of your hand....\n\n\n\nEdit : also...... This remind me of that one scene in requiem for a dream.... Be careful! Try the same spot on the other hand, or using the back of your hands, and switch between those. Use a smaller needle. I did not have any issues when I used the tiny black butterfly needles and I infuse at least thrice weekly - with misses that means like 3 x 4 or 5 needle pokes = 12 yo 15 jabs each weeks. Now that my country has effectively banned black butterflies and only the bigger yellow butterflies and above are available, i am getting quite bad scarring on my 3 infusion sites (they look like yours). I have found that applying Hirudoid Cream aka Mucopolysaccharide polysulphate (organi-heparinoid) helps somewhat but that causes its own problems.\n\nAs for vein collapse, I had one collapse when I was totally incapacitated and apparently they were pumping antibiotics daily through it. That seriously irritatated the vein and that particular collapsed vein has never recovered. When I had antibiotic injections since then, Those veins also transformed from easy to hit big bulging veins into hard to hit does not pop up veins. Rotate Veins find a few your comfortable with. I cannot get any on my left arm, cause of fused elbow and very little muscle. But I used to have a few on my arms and hand that i would hit so scar tissue would not be a huge issue.

Just wanted to post this to say that getting punched in the head is an experience il never forget. And being in a fight. Kickboxing going 80% is what we were doing. Depending on your situation ide say stay away from things you know youl get hurt by such as lightcontact sparring fighting. But things that have a bit of risk but are still doable such as wrestling, jujitsu and motos are do able. Still more dangrous then normal but definitly do able. Idk but i wanted to post this.  &gt;But things that have a bit of risk but are still doable such as wrestling, jujitsu and motos are do able.\n\nYeah, no. Plenty of low contact sports for severe hemo folk without Jujitsu or wrestling. \n\nI get it-  you are young. I recall your post where you mentioned getting a motorbike. You want to be normal. But you have a severe medical condition. You are an absolute moron for advocating heavy contact sport and activities to a community of bleeders. \n\nEither you got hit too hard in the head in your sparring, or not hard enough. I am not sure which. Idk if i said this but i said i dont recomend kickboxing or any sport like it that youl get a confirmed bleed somwere everytime you fight someone. Ive wrestles for 3 years and ive learned to take care of myself while doing so and jujitsu is even softer then wrestling( although in some situation can be more dangrous) and have had 1 injury from wrestling in my shoulder and i got physical therapy and its all better. Just be smart on what you do and see if in your current situation you can do what you want to do whatever it is. That Is the most important part Good for you? This is horrible advice Dude you are asking to die, get a fucking reality check and go to therapy. Do not ride your motorcycle, dont get into fights for no reason, and stop posting dumb shit for validation. Why cannot you find a positive way to be involved that does not end with you hurting yourself? When I was younger all of my friends would skateboard and I would go along and take photographs of them. I still would skateboard but I would not be jumping off things or hurting myself. Best of both worlds....\n\nHave you considered becoming a referee or something? Be safe, prophy before sparing, wear your medic alert to matches and while riding, bring factor where you can and make sure you have a good support network. But do not let these nay-sayers keep you from living your life and do not let your medical condition keep you from doing what you love! Were do i say get into fights for no reason. I say i dont reccomend what i did. And that people should stay away from that Well from my experience i use to skateboard and rollerskate when i was little and fell alot but like small falls and nothing ever happend. Ide say stay away from things you know your going to get hurt by. I think i said that. That Is what im saying. I think i legit say that sparring or fighting should be completely ignored because your always going to end up hurt but things such as wrestling and jujitsu are completely fine if you take meds befoee u do it and take care of yourself. If you havent done either of those 2 sports and you say there dangrous then im sorry but your an idiot. Just be careful with what you do and dont do things you know your going to get hurt with each time. Such as sparring. I think i said that to. I would recoemnd working out if your situation allows it though. It toughens up your joints and muscles so you get less injury. Huh? My dude I am in the Kinesiology program at university, which is literally Physical Education. I just am in the socio-cultural aspect of it, aka, i study sports. See? I know from first hand experience you can modify your own activities to get the best of both worlds.\n\nMy point was that you should look for things to do that do not involve getting beat up, hit, etc. I went through all of this, as a teenager, same as you. I wanted to play football, I wanted to play rugby and contact hockey. You know what ended up causing me to get hurt? Playing golf. The golf club hitting the ground causing vibration did irreversible damage to my arm and elbow. Just trust what the doctors are saying. Trust what people older than you are saying. You do not want to be in the position of losing the ability to do somrthing you were once able to. I can barely even touch my face with my hand, I cannot pick up more than 10-15lbs. You live with a disease that has long term consequences in various ways. It is not that you get a sore elbow and it goes away. The sore elbow continues to get sore, more and more, and next thing you know you need this surgery, that surgery, and eventually an entirely new elbow. \n\nYou only get one chance. That Is what im saying tho. Isnt it? Or did i word it wrong. I said that i dont recomend any sport in which you get physicaly hit and are going to always come home with an injury such as kickboxing.. i also said that wrestling and jujitsu are ok to do if you have meds and know what your getting into because its just grabs and technique type shit.  \"Wrestling is a GRAPPLING COMBAT SPORT.\"\n\n \"jiu jitsu is a COMBAT SPORT\"\n\nYou can stop now, laughs. You are not going to convince anybody here what you;re doing is a good idea. Especially if you come around speaking about getting hit so hard you bleed. You are twisting everything. I was talking to my doctor and he said i can do wrestling though. Was he wrong? If you, your doctor, coach, the school, all know the risks involved and you have a plan that lets you do it safely without getting beat up, causing bleeds. Then yeah, of course. That is literally doing what I was speaking about, finding a unique way to do a sport that does not involve totally destroying yourself. But once you explain to your coach you can die from internal bleeding, the school is not going to want to be involved with it. Have you been honest with all of them and come up with a plan for if / when you eventually get dusted / hurt?\n\nHave you spoken with the coach / school about it? Sitting down with them is probably a good start at least. And you should not just downplay severe hemophilia as something mild... I said i dont recomend sports in which you get hit everyday and come home with an injury each time. Ive done wrestling because its a grappling sport with throws and such which obviously isnt recomended but 1000 time more safw then boxing. And that is why i said i dont recomend boxing. I feel like im repeating myself here Yup and i wrestle just the same as anybody else because the sport isnt dangrous as you think. Its more tiring then anything. But i understand were your coming from. Look up wrestling matches and see what they do. No punching or getting hurt. Just look it up man, before you come and say what you think. We are going to keep going in circles. You say it is not dangerous, yet you made a post about getting hit to the point of bleeding. You have loads of people here saying look to do something that does not involve physically damaging your joints / muscles. So, I am obviously not going to change your mind. In 10-15 years when you have 3,4 debridement surgeries, are looking at joint replacement surgery and can no longer move your joints, we can talk. It happens to the majority of hemophiliacs. This is not some radically new thing, that internal bleeding can cause long term damage. Yes you might feel great in the short term, but hemophilia has a way of sneaking up on you down the road. Google bulging synovial lining, that can / does happen to most hemophiliac joints that have bleeds.\n\nI have one anecdote, until I was 23, my doctors were amazed that I could straighten my left arm to 100% besides it bleeding almost weekly for my entire life. I am 30 now, I still exercise the same amount, and my elbow now has reduced range of motion so low I can no longer touch my face. It has a way of sneaking up on you, dude.\n\nObviously nothing I say will change your mind, but all of many of us here have similar experiences / horror stories and we are just trying to look out for you / lend our experiences so you do not have to go through them. Ty for your advice man. Im looking into talking to my hem doctor to learn more about it. But what your saying is that the real shityness of having hemophilia is when you get older? But one last thing. I said i never got a bleed from wrestling for 3 years and that i did kickboxing for 3 weeks while im on vacation and i got punched in the face 3 times and i am now back in the US and wanted to say that i really dont recomend any punching sport or kicking sport. Its what ive been saying. I keep saying that i dont want anyone with hem to do boxing or any time of punching or fighting in that manner. Sure, but wrestling is literally a sport of squeezing, holding and grappling your opponent. All of those aspects of the sport scream \"INTERNAL BLEEDING\" to hemophiliacs. Yes, talk to your hemophilia doctor about it.\n\nThis is all coming from a guy who watches every UFC, Bellator, most Olympic wrestling trials, I love the sport. I am just a realist, my dude. Hmm. So why have not i had any internal bleeds, unless i didnt notice. Ty anyways tho bro For me, I was having small bleeds in my elbow that I would ignore / often could not fully detect because I became used to always being sore. Breakthrough bleeding where my elbow would stiffen up was less common (but still a monthly occurrence). But my synovial lining bulged out of my elbow and it looked like a big mushy sack hanging off the side of it, so we knew it was bleeding. \n\nI tried for a long time to do what you are doing right now, to live a normal life and not worry about the long term, and I really regret it. But I can only really speak from my own experiences. I literally now have to wear a huge arm brace and I do not wish that on anyone, it is so f'n hot and uncomfortable. Dam\u2026 i heard that theres hope for genetic treatment in the coming years though no? Also theres helimbra. I heard a couple people here on helimbra who havent gotten a bleed in 2 years. Isnt that basicaly living a normal life at that point? I take hemlibra and I have gotten two breakthrough bleeds. It works really great but it is not perfect.  I also do not do combat sports, or ride a motorcycle, so I can not report on how well it works in those situations, lol. Are your joints better now that u take helimbra? No dude. My elbow has irreversible damage done to it. There is no going back. I have had 3 surgeries on it, 1 synovial injection, two debridement (where they scrape the shit growing on your elbow joint off), and will likely need to get a joint replacement, aka a metal elbow. There is no going back once you start to do damage. Dam. Ty for letting me know. Ill be more careful from now on. How old are you if you dont mind telling me. Im 17 I am 30. I agree. If you end up getting hurt too much then take it easier. But having hemophilia does not mean you have to limit yourself. Everyone is different too, and some people do well with lots of heavy activity. I have known plenty of Hemo\u2019s who were into martial arts and they were better for it. They learned their limits too which is part of the deal. As long as you have factor on hand and infuse for injuries, and take care of them until your healed up, you can do pretty much whatever. I really believe the reason I am still healthier than most people my age is that I never let hemophilia limit me. How old r u? And what do you do I am 46. I am a musician and do all kinds of stuff. I think I have talked to you before about riding motorcycles. I have done all kinds of jobs, mostly to do with music. I have toured in bands and have ran a recording studio off and on for 20 years at least now. Now I also run a business that is helps people with hemophilia get factor. I am one of the fortunate people with severe A that avoided most joint damage, so I am still pretty much unscathed , physically at least. Having a lot of patience to let myself fully heal from bleeds is the secret. Self discipline. I am actually just about to take my trail bike up into the hills in a couple hours. I wish I had a riding buddy! Man i wish i could ride with you. But ya ty it must take patience to let somthing completely heal like that. I think im to young still but i havent gotten or felt many bleeds at all That is good. I had a ton of bleeds as a kid but everyone is different. I was one of the first people to do Profolactic infusions so I did not leave as much as some people do.", "Anyone ever struggle with alcohol? Any fellow hemophiliacs or people with bleeding disorders ever struggle with an alcohol problem? I feel like the biggest idiot in the world, as obviously it is extra dangerous for us to drink to excess and then hurt ourselves. I have had a number of bleeds from accidents that happened while I was drunk that I would give anything to go back in time and prevent. Not sure why I was never able to stop binge drinking in the past, as I am not an idiot and know that it is bad for me. But i am finally committing myself to sobriety now at least...\n\nHope everyone is well and wishing you good health. I do not have any type of alcohol problem. Maybe it is due to the fact that I am \u201conly\u201d 20 years old. However, when I started to drink with friends at parties and clubs I noticed that the numbness that alcohol invokes  made me deafen my joint pain. \nSo after every party I needed to stay in bed for the next day because I overdid it by walking too fast or just walking too much while tipsy.\n\nThis made me realize that my situation and alcohol is not a good combination. So I stopped drinking altogether.\n\nHow old are you and what have your experiences with bleeds while tipsy been? I have.  During 2019, it got to the point where I drank 11 one litre bottles of rum in a month.  Last year my parents intervened and rationed my intake, but I would still sneak an extra bottle a couple of times a month so I could get shitfaced.  In april I decided to stop altogether, and now I only drink beer and cider. The only problem I have with drinking is a bleed the next day from who knows what Yep.  Drink for pain management, but cause a bleed from who knows what.  It is a vicious cycle. I used to drink.  Then it became a problem.  Fortunate that there were no direct problems caused by it.  I gave it up 30 years ago.  Do not miss the hangovers. alcohol wreaks havoc with clotting...  especially with some of us Never had a problem with drinking in excess but in my late 20s I started noticing a lot more bleeds after days I drank so now I only drink a couple times at most every year. I would not be too hard on yourself, we all just want to be \"normal\" and it sucks having to slowly cut more and more activities out of our lives as we age. At least that is how I feel. I wish you the best. Alcoholism and substance misuse amongst Haemophiliacs is not talked about much within the community or by medical professionals. But I have met a number throughout the years, and due to how few of us there are, it seems that many Haemophiliacs are at above average risk of developing poor relationships with alcohol and or substances. I am in my 40\u2019s and throughout the years I have met many haemophiliacs that have either expressed concern about the effect alcohol has had on their treatment and condition as well as others that have engaged with high risk behaviour. I certainly drank too much and partied too much in my 20\u2019s with the Intendant bleeds from falls and recklessness. I seemed to have unknowingly at the time a need to \u2018prove\u2019 myself capable of drinking and partying harder than others maybe as an overcompensation for vulnerability. There has also been times, and I have spoken to others that have experienced this to a greater degree, to abuse painkillers and some have developed real problems with addictions. It is vital to keep an eye on your motivation and the amount you take. I know of at least 2 haemophiliacs and one Christmas disease sufferer that developed serious addiction issues and had stints in rehabs. Like anything it is about keeping safe and being honest. But I really wished I knew about the susceptibility to longer harm and risk when I was partying in my 20\u2019s. It makes me shudder with \u2018what if\u2019 from some of my memories. Especially when it comes to head injuries or traumatic bleeds. But certainly alcohol and or substance misuse is a problem for many haemophiliacs. Had a doctor pull me aside for a private conversation when I was 18, he told me they have noticed Haemophiliacs tend to develop drinking problems more than the average person \ud83e\udd37 Did not surprise me at all, we are not just dealing with Haemophilia, there is the other physical knock on effects that can come from having a bleed and you have got the mental health aspect of picking yourself up and going again, again.\n\nDrinking moderately around the house was not a problem, I always seemed to pick up a few knocks and bruises after going out and drinking. The last few times I drank I felt like it was causing my knee to inflame and also a pain in my liver, I told my doctor about this and she said no one else has ever reported a similar thing.\n\nI have not drank since 2019, I really do not miss it. No.\nMind you, I am not a \u201cgood\u201d hemophiliac; hardly keep to prophylaxis and hardly exercise. But I am 35 now and never took to alcohol because what is the reward? The risk far exceeds the reward.\n\nFind something others This does not shock me at all. People with chronic health problems have a higher incidence of psychiatric and substance abuse disorders from my understanding. Sometimes I wonder if I would be different had I not had hemophilia, but alas, that is a fruitless exercise since I will never know what that life could be like. Unfortunately drinking is causing serious damage to my health. So for me, drinking is something I can no longer do. Best of luck, my friend. You got this. I am coming up on 8 months sober after a good 10 year stint of daily drinking. I was up to a full 750ml a day of Scotch at my worst. I checked myself into rehab last November and it was the best decision of my life.

Basically I had not gone a day without getting fucked up in some way in a long time until this past November. I have never met a haemophiliac in person who had alcoholism. Maybe it is a regional thing. Well I am in my early 30s, and my experience involves having blackouts and then injuring myself badly because I am so uncoordinated while that drunk and also make bad decisions that I would not normally do. So getting tipsy is not how I would describe my behavior unfortunately. Honestly never had a problem with drinking and hemophilia related stuff until I started hurting myself while I was blacked out. \n\nIf I could go back in time, I would tell my younger self that it is just not worth it to drink.

His dentist with his hematologist said that they plan to give him a total anesthesia ( do not know the exact expressions, sorry) and a factor VIII injection to do only one session. Is it a normal practice ? Is not the anesthesia a little too much for caries ? What do you mean by carries? ( Damn, I used Google translate, I knew it was weird XD When the teeth are rotten Ah I see. Yes, being put under for getting fillings is not the normal go to option. However with the patient being so young, and doing that many teeth at once, I would imagine the thinking is that it will be a challenge for him to sit still through all that, which will not be an issue with anesthesia. It is not that uncommon. I was going to say I was surprised the hematologist did not recommend adding amicar to the treatment plan, but perhaps that is not as much of a concern as it would be for me given that the patient is mild.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo no, it is not that out of the ordinary. The only other advice I would add is to make sure the insurance is going to cover everything before the procedure. I had anesthesia when getting my wisdom teeth out and found out afterwards that my insurance was not going to cover that part, so that was an unexpected $400 bill I had to deal with. I think \"caries\" may be the correct medical term, but most people refer to them as \"cavities\". \n\nIt sounds like the dentist and hematologist have decided that general anesthesia is a better approach than injecting anesthetic (lidocaine, I think) directly into the gums.  It would probably take several injections in different places to numb all the teeth that need to be worked on.  I guess they are thinking that the fewer injections they use, the less likely that bleeding will be a problem.\n\nHere is something about the ( Thank you.

To give you some perspective on how large my duodenum is, the average is about the size of a Canadian Toonie, mine is about the size of a small football. They have inserted a GI tube that sucks all the vomit out of my tummy. It is probably the most uncomfortable thing I have ever experienced. If I did not have hemophilia they would operate but of course that would be way to dangerous for me. It is just a waiting game now, the hemotoma needs to disolve. No food or drink for 6 weeks. I can suck on hard candy and ice chips. I am hanging in there though my spirits are high. I will update you guys in another week.", "Tell us something interesting about yourself! I would like to get to know more about what fellow Hemophiliacs do for a living, like to do in their spare time, etc. I do not personally know any others with our disorder, so I would like to know about you guys. Tell us something about yourself; it can be anything!\n\nEdit: wow, it is awesome to see such diversity among our little community. You guys are great!", "I do not know what to say.  ^ I apologize for my bad grammar, my phone is wet hey buddy, you are feelings are so fucking VALID. You have a medical condition, and while you are not symptomatic it does not mean you DO NOT have a bleeding disorder.\n\nIf you are able to seek out therapy, I would recommend it. It seems like you almost have survivor's guilt in a way. It makes sense. And those nurses giving you shit for needles are highly unprofessional. That care team should be praising you for taking care of yourself and going to your appointments. \n\nI think you are doing a kick ass job. You are as much a bleeder as the rest of us. You are family, man. Thanks man, I really appreciate it. I never felt welcomed whenever I would go to the hospital for my checkups. Your post made my day :) Hey bud, your feelings are valid. i would recommend not using aspirin when you have a headache. secondly, I would also recommend therapy regarding your mental health. after that hope for a male heir since if you date a girl with no hemophilia, and you make her pregnant, if it is a girl, she has hemophilia, but if it is a boy it will not have. Finally i suggest not asking random strangers from the internet for help and seek a professional. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s, sorry if i look rude to you. I have mild hemophilia too. I do not infuse or worry about it most of the time. I did not even go to the hemophilia clinic for 15 years.\n\nHowever, I just had open heart surgery and was infused for a couple of weeks to make sure I did not have any bleeding issues. In cases like this, it can be worse to be mild than severe because they have to calculate your clotting factor and how much to give you to get to a normal level.\n\nI have also felt like I did not belong or was a fraud since I did not have to deal with all the issues that other hemophiliacs do, but we are all valid. I feel like you and I are in the same boat. I have only recently been diagnosed as an adult, and my haematologist has just arranged my first haemophilia clinic appointment.\n\nI feel awful seeing all the letters being sent to and from my two hospitals and my GP explaining all this stuff when I am actually only very mildly symptomatic. Like, I have had a couple surgeries, tooth extractions and injuries in the past and the only real problem is a bit of excessive bruising and being told I am a bleeder. I have also had the same thought about having kids, and I am also worried that my increased risk of bleeding increases my risk of miscarriage or a dangerous labour.  \n\nEven though you and I do not have many symptoms, the point is we are still bleeders, we have a right to have that diagnosis. I am grateful I am only a mild case, however I have learned over the last week that actually, I am entitled to those haemophilia appointments as that is what I have no matter how mild I have it or how severe others do. Love you hemophilia bro A surprisingly large amount of Hemophiliacs are mutants. About a third of all cases. We thought I was a mutant at first, since I have a lot of brothers, nieces, and uncles who do not have it.\n\nImpostor syndrome can be a bitch, but the bright side is that you have more doctors looking you over and catching things earlier.\n\nA lot of times I do not feel like I am Severe. I have not had a real bleed in years, just have very bad days where my arthritis and bone spurs act up. stay strong and away from blood thinners. it is great you have not had the need to learn to infused and that you do not experience bleeds.  I was mild (7%)  since I was diagnosed with hemophilia. couple years ago my HTC test my levels and they said that I was mild-severe @ (4%) i still do not experience major bleeds but my joints (mostly ankles) hurt more often... I bruise easier now. I am on hemlibra and I infuse myself whenever I feel like I need it. however I am more comfortable with poking myself.\n\n aspirin (ibuprofen) / turmeric /ginger /aloe vera / chamomile   - I read somewhere to avoid this.  can anyone confirm? I had a list of things to avoid but I misplaced it. I have severe A and have never worried about ginger. Maybe if you take high doses religiously it can help people with heart disease , but I would not consider it enough of a blood thinner to worry about. The positives of ginger outweigh the negatives for me. Just had to say that because I love ginger. i see. thank you for your response.! I will research some of them benefits. I am not sure if any benefits for hemophilia, but for things like having a cold or flu, or for nausea it works great. Plus I love the way it tastes and I have been told it strengthens bones and ligaments , but that was more of a wives tale type thing, not science based. that still sounds good if it helps with cold and flu...the only thing I have drank with ginger was Canada dry like twice lol 35 year old with severe A. At 18 I felt just as you did, for different reasons. I have had MANY episodes and would hardly ever take my medication. I did not feel as though I was worth the price tag. Why should I infuse a medication that costs tens of thousands when I am not worth pennies. I also never wanted children, so much so I never had sex with my partners just foreplay. From 16 to 24 I just smoked lots of weed and felt worthless and did nothing. But hey, now I have got two kids, a beautiful wife and a full time job that covers my medication. Granted I have no cartilage in three major joints... I have happiness.\n\nYou writing this and sharing it is huge.

Periods last so long that I basically lose all my blood and  become severely anemic. Birth control used to work for me but all of a sudden stopped for reasons no one can figure out. I have tried tranexamic acid, but I am supposed to take so many of those giant pills a day that they make me puke \ud83d\ude2d I genuinely have no idea what to do but this seems like a complaint a lot of people on here have been making. Has anyone found anything that works that I can ask my hematologist or gyn about?", "Do I Have Hemophilia ??? so to keep it short and simple, I like blood but only in visual instances (in certain cases, which I will explain later) because, in a fucked up way, I believe that splattered blood on the walls or anywhere really looks kind of aesthetically beautiful if that makes any sense. This is mainly the reason I enjoy bloody crime thrillers (goodfellas, taxi driver or kill bill \nare some of my favorites) or even horror movies (the original carrie movie showed me how much I love a good blood splatter) also, there are some music videos that I really really like just because they have a lot of blood in them like rockstar by post malone and ugly boy by die antwoord. \n\nthe thing is that even though I love watching blood in an \u201caesthetic\u201d kind of way, I do not like blood in other ways. I do not like tasting it, it does not turn me on (so I know it is not a fetish) and the thing that confuses the heck out of me is that when I see myself or someone I care about bleeding, I literally pass out ??? It is happened a couple times and I do not know why ?? \n\nam I normal? do I have hemophilia? I am so confused haha", "How much is it expressed in the level of FVIII in percent? When Hemlibra is injected, is it equivalent to a dose of FVIII strength of 100% or more or less? How much is it expressed in the level of FVIII in percent? I am not on Hemlibra so I am only going on what my hematology team told me, so correct me if I am misinformed. But I believe it brings you up to around 30%, essentially making you effectively a mild hemophiliac. That is why you still need factor on hand in case of bad bleeds. Hemlibra does not increase FVIII. It creates new substance which is similar to FVIII. Due to that when you  do factor test that is FVIII assay when on hemlibra it comes around 40-50-60% sometimes also as 90%, so i.e. why it is said that do not trust factor assay on hemlibra. My factor assay came back as 60%. I am on hemlibra for 3 years. My original I factor assay orginaly was 0.2%.hope this helps Could Hemlibra be used on demand for mild bleeding? If she can do that, why is it only for prophylactic use? Hemlibra can not be used after bleed because it needs booster dose in starting doses. For example my normal dose is .84ml but in starting two three weeks. I took 1.88ml that is double. And it does not act instantaneous like normal factor. It takes times to increase factor level. that is why hemlibra is pre-amptive medicine. Not post bleed. That is very interesting. Thus, Hemlibra needs time to manifest its power of hemostasis. How long does it take Hemlibra to exercise power? How many days? I have had hematuria before. One lasted 34 days. Then they treated me with fresh frozen plasma. If Hemlibra had existed then she would have stopped my hematuria maybe after 7 days. So, not on the first day but later. Is it such a mechanism of action? no, hemlibra cannot be given after bleed, it is to prevent blood as per my understanding, anyway refer with hematologist. Lmao is that a real thing or somthing u made up\ud83d\ude02 I am trying to figure out what is the point. FVIII has a range of normal values of 50% -150%. FVIII is consumed during bleeding but until it falls below 30% it is effective. And Hemlibra is consumed. However, unlike FVIII, only the booster level is effective. I guess that is the point. In other words, Hemlibra is consumed very quickly if bleeding already exists. And they must not give it in large quantities because of thrombosis. I am not on Helimbra. In fact, I do not think it is even available in my country. However, I am curious since Helimbra seems to raise the baseline of Factor VIII (equivalent) in the body, what do Haemophiliacs on Hemlimbra do when they go for surgery? Usually the Haematologist will raise the Factor VIII level to 80-90% through Factor VIII infusion, but what about for those on Helimbra? surgery are even easier for people on Hemlibra. because factor VIII is already around 60-70%. so with Factor VIII infusion it even increases. so very safe. I know personally two patients who undergone surgery under Hemlibra, one knee replacements and other appendix removal. both gone flawlessly Why cannot Hemlibra be administered intravenously?", "FDA Approves Genentech\u2019s Hemlibra (Emicizumab-kxwh) for Hemophilia A with Inhibitors  ( &gt; (", "Ankle Distraction Are there any severe hemophiliacs who have had ankle distraction surgery?\n\nMy right ankle is bone on bone and my left is not far behind. Over the years multiple orthopedic surgeons have commented that one day I will need to have both fused but I have 2 total knee replacements as well not to mention have seen multiple fellow hemophiliacs with ankle fusions with severe walking impediments which are far worse my condition.\n\nMy hematologist is of no assistance and has been from day one. I have pointed out ankle distraction with stem cells would probably be a better option but once you mention stem cells to any hematologist its like you stabbed their mother as they seem to lose their sh!t. I have had 2 PRP injections into each ankle already and although they did not permanently resolve my bad ankle joints (I did not expect a miracle) but there was an improvement for 3-6 months with inflammation and pain.\n\nIf I have to have joint fusion I will, but distraction with bone marrow stem cells seems to be a better alternative. I am currently on hemlibra (an injection once a week) and have not had a bleed in the last 3 years. I became more active and wore out my ankles at an accelerated rate due to the lack of bleeds so am feeling caught in a catch 22 situation.\n\nMy HTC basically have washed their hands and have said they have no solution to my ankle problems as my 'hemophilia' is under control. Just wondering if anyone else has had the surgery and could give me any feedback negative or positive. I am in the same boat.  Severe, double knee replacement, two ankles that are worn slap out.  My ankle pain was much worse 20+ years ago.  I have almost no movement in either but I cannot bring myself to give up the little flexion I have left.  If they were a source of severe pain, I would think differently but I guess I have destroyed all the nerves with a lifetime of grinding.  The problem is that we do not have a decent, prosthetic option for replacement.  HTCs are focused on controlling bleeding but they have not been much help to me beyond that.  Do a little research and see if you can find an orthopedic surgeon in your area to discuss options.  If you decide on a surgical option, they will work with the HTC.  And if you find any new options, let me know.  Good luck. Since I had to look it up: ( Previously, on r/Hemophilia:\n\n( My brother had a double ankle replacement. They used cadaver ankles. He was severe hemophilia A less than 1%. It took about 4 years to completely heal but when he was better they worked really well. He passed away a few years after from unrelated stuff. And I had a septic ankle (after years of Dr\u2019s saying I needed to get it fused) and the dr did an orthoscopic surgery where she squirted water through it to get out the staph infection, and apparently there were bone fragments or whatever else in there that came out too, so after 6 months of healing my ankle way better than it is ever been. That was 7 years ago or so and it is still great. So I would be cautious about getting an ankle fused too. There are other options, and once it is fused that is it. Then again, I know some guys with fused ankles who say it is not too bad. I would keep asking around and doing research. There are people out there, like my brothers surgeon who will work with you. Get as many opinions as you can. Yeah I did read that and tried to reach out to the poster who had it done but had no response. Its the first 2 minutes of getting up and moving around that is excruciatingly painful. After that period of walking the ankle joints loosen up so to speak and I can walk with hardly any pain. The draw backs are: \n\n1. If I sit down for 5 minutes I have to go through this experience again which can become quite daunting throughout a normal day.\n\n2. If I go on a long walk or am on my feet for longer than 15 minutes this normally results in that 'excruciatingly painful' episodes described above being an extended period - 30 to 60 minutes of torture to try and get my ankles moving or trying to break the stiffness in them. Say if I did a walk of an hour I would be off my feet for a day as the pain is unbearable once I stop.\n\nLike you I only have about 10-20 degrees left in my ankles and I would rather keep the range I have left. My hematologist and HTC are really limiting my options. I will go private but the problem I face is surgeons will not touch me without my hematologists approval. I have no joint space left in the right ankle which means no more PRP injections which were helping. Am currently looking at foot/ankle ortho specialists in my area - Australia/NZ. Thanks for the advice. I am severe with less than 1% as well and will be getting a number of opinions. I am in the same boat regarding fusions. All of medical professionals I have seen privately have commented of the negative effects of fusions and have warned me I will have continuing problems later on with the other ankle joints in my foot if I go the fusion route. Same boat. I started taken naproxen and that is been working so far. Been a month and pain is gone most days. Trying to avoid fusion as much as I can. I believe I responded to your message.

Recreational pot user and CBD vape experimenter reporting in. CBD vape juice is available on Amazon in the UK. You can also buy the oral CBD stufffrom Holland &amp; Barrett or other high street health food/supplement shop. I found the CBD vape juice very helpful for a while but ultimately I went back to smoking joints because it is cheaper and I like my CBD with a bit of THC.

His entire upper arm is purple. He is giving himself shots, but I wanted to know if there is anything else besides that that he can do or I can do for him. Any advice? RICE\nrest \nIce and infusion \nCompression \nElevation. \nThis is the formula.\nElevate it and compress it I mean elevate the bleed using a pillow and try wearing a bandage over it (by bandage I mean stockings) \n( \nIf all of the above fails and it is still terrible please visit a haematologist as fast as possible. Regular factor (infusion) must be given. I suggest him to keep his arm in a proper position and try to apply ice regularly. Please remember that this bleed can make the joint targeted and this will make his arm sticky. Wear an arm rest when moving and take care! Hope it gets better. In my experience if I have treated and the pain and swelling is decreasing, I do not worry about the bruising.  Most muscle or soft tissue bleeding will look some much worse once they start resolving.  As the body breaks down the blood it comes to the surface and can look really nasty. Eventually the dark purple colour will start getting a greenish colour, especially around the edges.\n\nThe bruising may not even be where the bleed was.  Like all liquid blood will want to pool at the lowest point.  I once took a baseball to the shin which caused  a giant hematoma, days later my entire foot was purple as the blood slowly drained.  \n\nLike most medical advice on the internet he should speak to his HTC if he has concerns.  In the meantime, as the other poster mentioned RICE.  Sit on the couch and watch some movies with him. Do not compress it ... It is the bicep region ... just elevation (so it does not go down into the elbow and forward into the forearm) and constant ice is enough ... More often compression will just flare the bleeding in muscular regions ... Keep the factor infusion as regular and there is nothing to panic Hospital, if he actually has hemophilia and this is happening you need to go to the emergency room as bleeds like this can end up getting soooo much worse.\n\nYou got to suck it up and go to the hospital Rice it is been refuted by the own creator of the method\n Oh...wow, I use it everytime and it works like a charm for me. If you got a better way feel free to comment it out thanks for the link! I will show this to my physio tommorow ;) let us see what she says I will update it to you tommorow It will not worsen  the condition and ice does aliviate the pain, but normally I just only infuse if need, if it is in a joint ill wait to the point I can use flossbands and that is pretty much how I have been dealing with things since I started researching, I have been pretty successful in my own rehabilitation journey you can see in my profile I already posted some pics of me, hope it can motivate some to start they own journey to enhance not only health but life. Honestly the treatment practices have changed so much.  In my life it has gone from being in hospital, bed ridden, in traction for a week, then wheel chair for another week for bad hip bleed to stay off it for a day then start doing some moderate exercise as pain allows.  After my most recent ankle surgery they had me weight bearing the next day.  Even more recently I was told for a hip replacement I would not even have to spend the night in hospital, same day. \n\nTruth is for most muscles bleed or deep tissue, the cold from an ice pack is unlikely to penetrate that deep.  It does alleviate pain and is unlikely to cause any harm.  Compression does work, surgeons still use tensor bandages to minimize swelling.  It can also help to stabilize the region ie prevent movement which can so help with pain. Yeahh ... Rice works great but in my case of non joint related bleedings like thighs and bicep compression does not work at all Thank you so much \ud83d\udc93 everyone has been so helpful! That is what we did last night. I gave him an ice pack and let him just lay down with his arm elevated When I touched it, the swelling decreased and you could see my finger lines in his skin. And I was really gentle. I have him an ice pack and elevated his arm. He kind of fell asleep like that. I am pretty nervous about putting a compression. Sleeve on him cause when I touched it lightly, I left finger marks. It was so bizarre I looked at your profile and saw your in really good shape. Does building muscle and working our help your condition or do you have to be really careful about lifting weights and working out? My boyfriend is a healthy weight but average muscle mass. He is mentioned before that he used to work out but I did not ask any further than that. I really want to know too!! I am really really new to dealing with hemophilia and I want to make sure I support him and do what I can to help (without being annoying) Do not worry about compression.  Honestly if it is not actively bleeding compression is not likely to help.  Hopefully by now it should not be actively bleeding ie. Getting worse,. If  it is getting worse he should go to the hospital. Well as being a hemophilic gives us extra danger in relation to joint degeneration as time goes by, strengthening the muscles surrounding the joints really helps to ease the work of the joints, if he has any lower leg problem I would really recommend kneevertoesguy, give it a look in his insta, his workout are not high load but still, are giving me and my legs really good results in range of motion, pain and overall mobility in day to day, but to any hemophilic I would strongly recommend some sort of strengthening training as basic as it might be will not do harm if you start slowly and build up. Call his HTC, tell them about it so they are at least in the loop information wise. At the hospital I go to they always have a hematologist on call, so you could try to get advice that way (they may recommend coming to the hospital or not). Thank you so much for your help!!! He has a bad ankle that bleeds at least once a month. I gave him an ankle compression sleeve for that but it is not the best. Before I started working out I had lots of bleedings, not only in soft tissue but in joints too, and now ? I do everything and a little bit more and do not have anything, besides the gain in confidence, aesthetics, even the way people looked at me changed and most importantly the way I look at myself now is different so yeah for dudes like us who grew being taught that we are almost like glass it is the best. I also have a lot of problems with my ankles and the really game changer for me was kneeoftoesguy and floss bands they are incredible for joints and idk why people do not use them as often but they are a gift from God I assure you, and you can find them for less than 20$ on Amazon. THAT is what his arm looks like! I try not to freak out but this is all very new to me. Even before he showed me his arm he kind of said, \"do not freak out\". Cause I have seen some of his bad bleeds before. Weirdly enough, this makes me relieved. Hes also been dealing with it for 34 years so I am sure he knows what he is doing, but he is stupidly reckless at times too I looked at them on Amazon. I am going to get one and keep it at my house (since he is here alot) just encase. You, sir, are a godsend. Ok, is he severe hemophiliac? Is he following a treatment protocol of Factor replacement? \n\nWhen I was on factor replacement, if I did not do medication for a period of time my factor would get so low that bumping myself / sleeping funny could cause severe bruising. Took me most of my adult life to realize that I was essentially doing this to myself. \n\nSo, it might be a good time to talk about adhering to a rigorous treatment protocol. Especially if working out / physical activity is an important part of his life. Happy to help :) He has a very active job so he is rough on his body. He seems to only really take factor when he needs it or feels like he is got a joint bleed or something. He has taken it twice a day before and I have been there to see how it is done. It is runs in his family and it is pretty severe, I do not recall which type he is tho. \n\nWhen you say rigorous treatment protocol, how rigorous is rigorous? Well, there are 3 types of hemophilia. Severe, Mild and Moderate, each have a different level of clotting factor. Think of clotting factors like dominos, a person with severe hemophilia is missing 99% of the 8th (9th whichever) clotting factor. When you get a bruise or a cut, those dominoes try to fall over, causing what is called the \"Clotting cascade.\" If you are missing 99% or 50% of that 8th domino, it is very hard to finish the chain to create a clot / stop bleeding. \n\nUsually Severe hemophiliacs are on a treatment protocol that they agree to with their hematologist / htc. They will run pharmacokenetic test to see how fast he \"burns\"/uses factor, usually that is used to determine how often someone has to do medication. \n\nIf he is a mild or moderate hemophiliac he could just be on a factor-on-need basis, ie, if he begins to feel a bleed forming, do an injection. He told me that story of getting tested and stuff. But he said he only take it if he feels he needs it. But he cut himself shaving and it was literally bleeding for 2 hrs straight before we got it under control but it kept on bleeding for a full day, not gushing like the first two hours but enough that it bleed through a bandaid in two seconds.  The shaving story is literally the exact example I use to explain what experiencing hemophilia is like.  \n\nSeems like you are from NY / the Northeast of USA:  \n\nI would suggest just reaching out to a HTC via phone, usually is a good compromise for not having to go sit in the hospital for a bunch of hours. In the past if I have needed extra medication, I have called ahead and they have had it ready so that I do not have to sit and wait for them to procure it from the bloodbank or wherever. This is really awsome and so friggin useful!!! Thank you so much!!!!! I am saving this encase anything goes south and he cannot direct me on what to do. You are awesome my good dude, thank you so much He is treating it with factor. They cannot really do anything else. Ice and elevate. I would say light compression, like I tend to put a bit of pressure when wrapping cold packs around. \nOften looks super dramatic... keep an eye on it but he will know when the bleed stops, it feels different. \nA whole range of exciting colours await you as it heals. FYI a BJ can also be very beneficial by drawing the blood to other \"region\" or at least help with the pain ... i\"m sure that others can also confirm this theory as well. \n\nAt least my wife believe it :) \ud83d\ude10at the latest comment and also, yes, call the HTC. There is an emergency after hours number you can call on weekends and at night. The doctor will give you a treatment plan. If it is that serious that there is discoloration you should definitely be calling the Htc. Especially if he is severe, but in any way I know this post is a little old at this point but my best advice to you is literally do not freak out lol. If he needs or asks for something try to be there for him but he has almost certainly been through this before and knows his limits and how to treat it. For me personally when I am bruised it is actually just an inconvenience, while the bleeds other people cannot see are way worse. Obviously everyone is different but if he thinks he can treat at home I am sure everything is fine. Maybe just ask him to let you know if it feels like it is getting worse. :) Yeah, it sounds the patient is 1) an adult 2) has had this his whole life 3) knows how to self infuse 4) has plenty of factor 5) no inhibitors or crazy complications and 6) is overall feeling well with no concerning symptoms that would indicate massive blood loss.\n\nIf all this is true, no need to go to the hospital.  a bleed in the arm can be safely treated at home.

And try wearing a sling over the shoulder while moving and take usual rest and apply ice frequently. \nHow to tell if the injury went down? Do not mind the swelling or colour only mind the warmth of the injury and the mobility( by mobility I mean if your boyfriend is able to move his hand properly) ( arm range ). If there is no improvement try visiting a Haematologist and do not panic, this pain is usual ;) . \nPm me if you want to talk about it and update about your boyfriends condition with me. Hope the pain goes down! Do not panic everything will be normal!\nThank you for reading. Hey guys happy to update it back, I completed my session with my physio today.

I do not know the answer to your question specifically but I try to recycle the cardboard boxes my shipments come in. Wish I had a way to recycle the styrofoam, packing materials and gel packs. I can only keep and give away so many of those.\n\nSame goes for the individual dose packaging. It depends where you live actually,  every city has different recycling laws.

I have seen ( done with gene therapy. The dream is, of course, that we see palpable results one day. However, if my body starts producing Factor VIII, will inhibitors destroy it, essentially keeping me a hemophiliac even though I am cured? Does it matter what percent my factor levels rise to? That article cites levels reaching 30% of a normal person, which would be life-changing if I was actually capable of attaining that without inhibitors getting in the way. An inhibitor antibody will destroy factor, but it is impact on you depends on its titer and it is nature.  Antibodies are measured by the speed they react (Affinity) and the strength by which they bond (Avidity).  A high titer, but weak antibody does the same damage as a lower titer antibody that is stronger.  If you get the gene, and you have a dangerous antibody, it will likely take out the factor you now make.\n\nYou would likely need to be treated with immune suppression at a higher dose than they have typically used for these patients.  That would be a discussion point for the team that was giving you the recombinant virus.\n\nI do not know that I have heard many people getting sustained levels of 30%, but certainly peak levels above 30% have been reported.  Sustained levels above 15% have been reported and this is important as levels of factor 8 above 12 have been associated with basically elimination of spontaneous bleeding.

Hello, 21F here my hematologist just diagnosed me with both hemophilia A and Von Willebrand's. My iron levels came back extremely low recently to the point where I need iron infusions and have been on the low end for years (most likely because of heavy menstrual bleeding). How common is it to have these bleeding disorders comorbid? I cannot really find any info on having both, but it seems like both contribute to the heavy bleeding and iron loss. I would think that is pretty unusual. How did he/she diagnose it? You are fortunate to have a dr even thinking of these. AND testing you for them. It is actually not uncommon for vWD and low factor VIII levels to be comorbid. There is at least one product, Alphanate, which has a FVIII/vWF complex. Probably not unheard of since vWD is not very uncommon, just very under diagnosed.  Being a woman with hemophilia A and not just carrier status is the very rare part. Humate-P also has 8 and vwd factors. I had a test done for vWD because he suspected it might be causing my chronic iron deficiency Personally, I have severe type 3 vWD. My factor 8 levels are very low. To the point of being considered like Hemo A. But I have never been told I have both. It is just what type 3 vWD is. Low factor 8 and low vWF.\n\nI take Humate 2-3x a week with tranexamic acid in pill form 3x a day. Helps keep all my blood on the inside where it should be :) I guess I am wondering what assay was performed. vWF and FVIII complex together, but it is unlikely you would actually be deficient in both proteins. If he just did a clotting time or something like that rather than actual test for factor VIII and vWF levels then I do not think you could be conclusively diagnosed. What country are you in? I am in the US, the test measured vWF and factor VIII activity. Both came back low (factor VIII was only mildly low though), I guess that is why he concluded it was both? I have read about that as well, I seem to have type 1 or possibly 2 vWD, not severe though I actually have both aswell (plus thrombocytopenia), though both mild, and I have realized my Von Willebrands tends to take the front seat most of the time. Because mine is mild, I end up taking desmopressin for all of the above though.", "Do you need to take factor upon swelling? Hey guys, I am a hem B mild and I normally only take factor in emergency situations or upon serious injury. Today, a little above my ankle, my foot swelled up, but usually, for other swellings in my body, I just let them heal on their own since I am mild. Should I always take factor? Even with insurance it costs so much, I am not sure. Appreciate any help Stating the obvious here but none of us can tell from an internet post what your body's tolerance is, how long it takes you to recover from various day-to-day injuries, and what sort of long-term effects *not* infusing bleeds (if they are bleeds) might have on your joints.\n\nI peeked at your profile and see you are at Nova - if cost is an issue for your factor you should get in touch with ( because they may have ways to help you out. I know it is really boring when people on this subreddit reply by just saying \"Phone your Hemophilia Treatment Centre and speak to your clinician\" ... but it is also the best way (and, really, the only way) to get the correct answer. Thanks a lot, appreciate it for EPAHF! Ah sorry, my bad. I just wanted to get a feel about other B's with mild conditions and see if they were similar to me. Thanks tho! Absolutely. Came here to say basically this. Even if the person responding to your post is a clinician they are not YOUR clinician. They do not have access to any of your medical history or information that would support any kind of decision or advice that they can give you.\n\nI could not possibly speak to the number of times my ankles swelled and, other than that swelling, did not otherwise present as \"bleeds.\" No redness or discoloration, no pronounced heat. But they were also quickly resolved with clotting factor. I have even been told by a regular Doctor before: \"no sign of hemothrosis\" but then my Hematologist said factor anyway and boom! Swelling gone in 24 hours. You all got me about to make a flow chart to walk future posters through this... A RICE ( rest, ice, compression, elevation) r\u00e9gimen is slow, but works if you can rest. However, there are various scenarios for which you might need to consult a doc. For eg.\nWas there an injury? \nIs there numbness?\nIs a nerve being compressed? \nIs there an orthopedic issue?\nAnd many more. \n\nSpeak to a physician atleast, if you cannot visit now. &gt; Should I always take factor? Even with insurance it costs so much, I am not sure.\n\nDo you participate in your drug manufacturer's patient assistance program? Most of them will cover your co-pay. If you ever have swelling in a joint, I would 100% take factor. You do not want lasting damage to your joints, especially ankles. A lot of us deal with lifetime issues from bleeds in those areas. If it is in a muscle I would be more hesitant. That being said, I am not a doctor or specialist and if you have questions/concerns you should always seek medical advice from a professional. Did not know about that, thanks! Very true, thanks, appreciate it! Thanks, appreciate it! Huh, interesting, it is been about the same for me, but due to the cost, I try to avoid it. Thank you, appreciate it! ( I mean, stuff like micro, and minor bleeds can still do damage, and have lasting impacts. Once a trigger area starts, it can start happening more and more. \n\nSo like others have said, give a call to your HTC, and double check with them. Facts, thank you! I know it is tough even with insurance, I have been in some rough spots without insurance, and making those calls whether to infuse or not is so damn stressful. \n\nWe cannot always do what we should, but at least with a professional's help they will be able to give you more info, and maybe options to help make that choice yourself.\n\nGood luck :) Thanks a lot, appreciate it! And so sorry to hear you were in that situation too. Due to the cost of the factor or of speaking with a provider? Mainly the cost of a factor but whenever I try to speak with a non-HTC provider they try to hit me with unnecessary x-rays, ultrasounds, and other things. Also I just recently arrived in the USA so it is hard for me to get an appointment with an HTC One lesson I quickly learned... basically never discuss your hemophilia with a non-HTC provider. And I mean on a professional level as a caregiver. You can of course talk about it, but as far as care or maintenance of it goes... stock with a real hematologist. Providers do need to know of course that you HAVE IT, but almost anything they need to know ABOUT it should be discussed provider-provider with your HTC. I literally told my doctor \"no.\" when he did the exact same. Wanted a whole slew of his own tests. \"No.\" Well I need to know about your Hemophilia. \"No, you do not. I have a hematologist who has made hemophilia his subspecialty and his life's work. My Hemophilia will never be managed by you. Any care or treatments you feel might interact in some way with my Hemophilia you should call this number: \"##########\" I have signed releases for you and all of my records are available through my HTC. If you are willing to pay out of pocket for any tests you want done, I am feeling generous and am willing to play guinea pig for a bit. But otherwise I decline. Will that be a problem for you to continue being my Provider?\"\n\nAs to the cost of factor, if you live in the US get with your local HTC and discuss cost. Most that I am aware of staff a social worker for exactly this reason. Their are many options and many ways they can help increase access to care. If you are insured and paying prescription co-pay for your factor contact your clotting factor's manufacturer and see about \"patient access services\" or \"co-pay assistance.\"\n\nIt took me WAY too long to finally learn how to advocate for myself.\n\nI will say this: We are pretty rare creatures statistically speaking. They ALL read about hemophilia in medical texts, they all learned a little about us in med-school. But nothing real world, nothing practical.  Most doctors will go their entire career without ever actually treating one of us for so much as the common cold. Only a very small fraction of doctors actually manage hemophilia as a condition. It is not uncommon (at least it has not been for me) for a physician to show a certain level of medical/scientific/professional curiosity about the actual real world aspects of my condition. Now, they cannot just pop right up and express that, it might be taken as rude... But I have received much better care and attention in some circumstances by being open and willing to share about myself.\n\n\n\nTl:Dr I won a bet about my hemo with a curious ER doc. \n\nHell, I took a ten off of an ER doctor one night when he lost a bet about my hemophilia. I had broken my nose and gone to the ER. Of course, they ordered clotting factor immediately after triaging me and learning about my Hemophilia. The ER doc was not super happy about just leaving me to sit and bleed on a gurney while the factor was couriered to the hospital. He asked if he could try some of the more traditional measures. I had a feeling he was half just curious about what would work so I told him like above: Whatever he tried was almost certainly doomed to fail, but as long as it did not show up on the bill I was happy to play guinea pig and let him try whatever he thought might help. And man did he try a few things. Turns out an emergency room is just lousy with things that stop bleeding. Who knew, right? Three or four different things, including some weird tongue depressor looking thing covered a clotting agent stuffed up my nose... Nothing. He gave up after that but apparently left word with the nurse to get him when the factor arrived. When he took time to come WATCH clotting factor I knew I had been right. Guy was just curious. So i asked, and he somewhat sheepishly admitted. It was a massive syringe and the directions stated a fairly slow injection... So I joked and bet him 10 bucks the bleeding would stop before the syringe was empty. He did not buy it and took the bet. Sure enough, about 3/4 done all the wet works stopped. He clicked his tongue and shook his head. I remember him saying something to the effect of \"wish it was that easy on normal folks.\" He thanked me for \"putting up with him\" and then he paid up. This was not a young guy either. He was a 40s-50s-ish man. A veteran trauma doctor at Ben Taub hospital in Houston. I am sure he is been ankle deep in blood an uncomfortable number of times. But he would never seen that before. Lol. Thanks for sharing! And wow, I have been in the exact same situation as you. I was in the ER and they did a lot of fancy tests and quirks on me as I was semi-unconcious. Turns out in the end, all I needed was factor and it would have saved up all the expenses the procedures drew up. I think your post should be part of some kind of Hemophilia guide. Despite doctors having such high salaries and having studied medicine for so many years, it is astounding how some of them know little about hemophilia. Make sure you have a medical alert bracelet/necklace. Ask your HTC about a \"Travel letter\" and a card for your wallet. Keep it with your ID. It helps. ESPECIALLY since you say semi-concious. I cannot overstate the importance of emergency medical staff knowing your condition and dosing. Especially if you are completely unconscious. That information may be the difference between you waking up again or not. Facts, facts. Thank you! I say, if you have hemophilia, take factor for any injury that does not heal right away. This is my rule: if I am asking wether I should infuse, I should have already infused.\n(In a perfect world where we have access to medicine, that is).

Last I read said we were ok with any of them, but you could check in with your local/national hemophilia society to see if there is updated info available. I have VW and got the J&amp;J shot before the blood clot piece was known ~7 weeks ago. So far so good! When the Aztrazenica first started making concerns with the blood clots, I basically said \"come at me\" because if we do not clot easily, would not that balance out the potential for any clots? \n\nThough the clots do apparently have links to high level of estrogen/hormones. Yes. My doc also said clotting might actually be an advantage, than a risk. I have heard you can still have issues even with a bleeding disorder since the deficiency is typically in on type of factor (or component to the clotting process) \n\nI got the J&amp;J in early April and I have been fine outside of being relatively low energy but I figure that might have to do with stress from work \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I thought they figured out that the percentage of people who got blood clots after taking the j&amp;j vaccine was the same percentage of people that get blood clots anyway?

Both can help you very much.\n- Lower your chance of bleeds by lowering the chance of them happening. This does NOT mean lying in bed all day, the stronger your body is and your muscles are, the less likely you are to have long lasting big bleeds. So work out in a controlled way, stay active, work your joints by just walking / cycling everyday. This also helps with mental healt issues!

My doctor said that SSRIs can cause bleeding complications and that I need to talk to my psychiatrist to switch my medication to another drug that is not a SSRI or SNRI.\n\nZoloft works really well for me and I am incredibly nervous about switching to another drug. I was looking through the options and it seems like almost every drug is an SSRI or SNRI. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Or does anyone know of a drug that has similar results? \nI take 50mgs of Zoloft for depression and anxiety. Hi there,\n\nI am a type 3 severe vWD who takes venlafaxine (effexor) which is an SNRI. I have been on this medication for a little over a year, and I have noticed minimal bruising and small bleeding. My pharmacist was concerned as well and discussed it with my hematologist and they came to the conclusion that the risk factors were low enough that it was worth trying if it meant my mental health improved.\n\nI trying to keep up with my injections, to keep the bleeding risks at a minimum, but sometimes I slip up. Everyone is different though, and everyone bleeds different. I am on 100mg and it is been good for me. I have severe hemophilia A. Have you been bleeding a lot? I would say if you are able to keep your bleeding controlled with Stimate or lysteda or tranexamic acid or whatever the treatment for vonwilibrands is for you, then I would not worry too much. Your mental health is important and it is not always easy to find an ssri that works for you. This is just my thinking. I also have VWD and struggle with anxiety, but I have not taken any prescription drugs for anxiety. However, I have had excellent results with L-theanine supplements. ( is an amino acid that occurs naturally in tea (it is why tea has a calming effect), but there are also supplements you can buy in drugstores/Amazon/etc. It has not caused any side effects or bleeding issues for me and really helps calm me down. There are very few known side effects. I bought a powdered supplement from Amazon that I mix into coffee, juice, etc. And it is a legal substance that will not cause any issues with a drug test (I have to be randomly drug tested at work and cannot even use cbd products because they can have trace amounts of thc that show up). YMMV and definitely run this by your doctor, but I wanted to at least mention it! \n\nAs another anecdote, my brother in law is on SSRI/SNRI's and has also had good luck with l-theanine. Not sure if he has ever used them interchangeably though. Hi! I have VWD type I and I am currently on Venlafaxine (SNRI) and while it is not perfect, it is not causing nearly the amount of bruising or random bleeds that I was having with SSRIs. Have you noticed changes in bruising or bleeding after you started the Zoloft? I was diagnosed after I started the Zoloft but I think my bleeding and bruising has been the same. I usually always have really heavy periods/clot passing, nose bleeds, and bruising. \n\nMaybe I have had slightly more bruising but I am pretty clumsy and have a big dog so it could just be my luck! That is good news! So I may be able to just switch to a SNRI. That leaves a lot more options! \n\nI have not noticed much change since I started the Zoloft a year ago. I still have the same amount of nose bleeds and heavy periods. Maybe more bruising but I am very clumsy and I have a giant doofus dog that is always stepping on me or knocking me over. (She thinks she is a lap dog) I will ask my doctor about that and see what she says or if I can mix it with whatever drug I end up on. I think I might have slightly more bruising. I do have a huge dog that knocks me over a lot and I am naturally a klutz. \n\nI did not know I had VWD Type 1 until recently even though my whole life I have had heavy periods/clots passing, nose bleeds, and bruising. No one put it together until I had to have a procedure and I had a lot of bleeding.\n\nSo that said I was not looking for more bleeding but my period and nose bleeds was not anything unusual. Wish I had kept track of them. \n\nI am relieved that a few people are using SNRIs with little side effects. That opens up a lot more mediations that could be used! That is very similar to my story. I was always an easy bruiser/bleeder, but I did not get the diagnosis until moving to a new state and a new provider took my health history (which included hemorrhaging 2x after tonsillectomy at 20!) and referred me to hematology. I am glad you have got the information now, and it sounds like you are taking an active approach towards being in charge of your mental and physical health :) My daughter is a symptomatic carrier of hemophilia , so she has mild hemophilia pretty much. She has some of those same problems. Not as much nose bleeds tho. Lysteda seems to be the thing people are using to help that stuff. Or stimate, but it got recalled and I do not know when it will come back. And transexamic acid (that might be what lysteda is) It always amazes me what is missed sometimes by doctors! I am glad you were finally diagnosed as well after all that! My dr did mention stimate and a stimate test but said we would have to do that later on because of the recall. \n\nI picked up my Lysteda (it is Tranexamic acid, just checked out the bottle) this week and I am kind of excited to use it on my next period. How is it that I never heard about the stimate recall?? Not sure. It was not the Stimate that was bad, it was the bottle. I guess it squirted the wrong dose into your nose.. So at least there is that. I still would not use it tho. Also I have the recall letter somewhere if you need the lot#\u2019s that were recalled. I think I googled it actually.

Remember its ok however good or bad your experiences were. I have been limited to a lot through the years. Still limited even in daily things. I have a fu ankle and one replacement (on opposite legs). My life has been full of pain. I take pain meds and smoke a lot of pot. Childhood? Terrible. I was bullied to the point of suicide attempts. Was always in a cast of some sort. Could not join in on physical stuff. Zero friends. I was always getting beat up with no way to defend myself. Ate lunch alone. Sat on the stoop during recess if I was not getting my face beat in.\n\nHigh school was a little better I guess. Went to a tech school while everyone I had been to school with before went to the local high school. Learned to turn wrenches. Clicked with a few people. Still could not do rigorous activities. Mostly played video games if I was not at the dragstrip. I would still show up in crutches and casts, but the guys I clicked with were cool with me as I could do anything to a car or truck. \n\nCollege was a blur. My experiences growing up still affected my friend making abilities. I was still a bit awkward. \n\nProfessional life is better. However it did stick me behind a desk. I work in an enclosed space behind to monitors and no windows. Had total knee replacements (both) early on. That was a game changer. No longer needed the cane I had been using since I was 12. The people I grew up with bullying me started dying off from drug overdoses, DUIs, and suicide. Started thinking on my own. Bought a house. Met my wife. Started a family. Bought a larger house- things I never thought I would be able to experience.\n\nHemlibra came out. And that is by far the biggest change. One injection a week. I have not had a bleed in over two years now. I am still adjusting to this life. I am still a bit of an outsider. I can talk to anyone, but making true friends is still a struggle. I do not do well in groups. I do not \"hang out\" with anyone. \n\nI have a lot more freedom now with the new meds. Weekdays I am behind the desk, but weekends I am tooling around on dirt bikes, running tractors, and using a chainsaw. I guess I am trying to make up for lost time from when I was a kid. I only have mild hemophilia, so it is not that bad on a day to day basis.  My dad did not find out he had mild hemophilia until post surgery and he almost died, so I got tested...\n\nI think the hardest part so far was giving unmedicated birth. The hospital barely got factor in on time and my hemoglobin level dropped from 14 g/dL to 7 g/dL immediately after birth.  I think 6 g/DL is when they start giving you blood transfusions.\n\nI think this means I lost a lot of blood.  I am sure it would have been worse if I did not get factor at all.\n\nSo yeah, for major surgeries, giving birth, etc. having mild hemophilia can cause death if you are unprepared for it.  My dad did not get any factor because he did not know he had mild hemophilia and his heart stopped 4 times during minor surgery and he was stuck in the ICU for 3-4 weeks. Man. Atleast your all ok. Can mild hems live without injecting every other day? Yeah we can, so it is not nearly as bad as it is for severe hemophiliacs.  It is just that oftentimes mild hemophiliacs do not even know we have hemophilia until a major event (like surgery or labor) and at that point it is a big issue.\n\nMy dad also had a weird bleed ten years ago where he lost like half his blood and then passed out.  In retrospect, it was probably because of hemophilia but we had no idea at the time.", "Looking for research participants who receive blood/blood products in Canada Hi, we are a team of researchers at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada.

Thanks to the tips you guys gave me a while ago I have been doing real good, I have a nice routine going that seems to work every time, one shot one kill for about 3 months now knock on wood.\n\nI still want to get on Hemlibra but it is less \"I need this or else I dunno if I can survive\" and more \"It would be a lot more convenient to have this\". That, plus being busy / sick made me put off trying to get in to an HTC until recently.\n\nLast week I called my closest HTC (which is still quite a drive) and turns out they do not take my insurance (Blue Care Network). That is pretty rough, I am still not fully versed in all this insurance stuff but I am sure that means I will have to pay a lot more per visit, do not know if there is other ramifications. \n\nI would love to get in to the HTC, but this insurance thing is messing me up, and I am hesitant to try another HTC which would be even further of a drive. Has anyone else run into this problem? What did you do in the situation? I currently pay $50 for a visit to my hematologist with my insurance, how much would it be without them taking the insurance? Are there any other ramifications for seeing a doctor who does not take your insurance? I would be willing to pay more for elevated care as long as it is not too drastic. Any tips are much appreciated. One thing I learned about insurance is use the hell out of the representatives that are available from your insurance company. Sometimes you will be surprised at what they can do to get you covered. Sometimes you just have to pester people and ask ask ask.\n\nI have the same dilemma as you, my insurance does not cover the HTC closest to me, or any other one for that matter. Thankfully every other month the adult HTC closest to me sends a team of their nurses to a hospital very close to where I live and and my insurance then considers that to be \"within their covered network.\" Judging from the limited info on my EOBs I would expect to pay around 300 to 500 dollars for a visit. \n\nIt definitely is nice getting care from an HTC because obviously they have a much deeper understanding of anything you are going through and you can be more confident that you are getting the care you need.\n\nIf you end up going the self pay route I would make sure you get an itemized invoice that details everything they are charging you for. Hospitals like to add bullshit charges because they are used to soaking the insurance companies for money. Maybe I am wrong but it seems like you are new to choosing insurance.  Sorry I do not have much advice to offer in your current situation but next year when it comes time to choose an insurance carrier, get online or on the phone and figure out which ones cover your product (ideally Hemlibra since you seem to like that option) and also cover visits to your HTC.  It is a headache the first time or two but there are people at the insurance companies that will answer questions and tell you if they cover a particular doctor or medication.  After you do it once or twice it will be easier or even better, you can just stick with the same insurance from year to year once you figure out your best option.  If your insurance does not cover your HTC, worst case scenario you will be billed for the visit.  It will probably be a few hundred dollars.  Most hospitals will bill you and accept almost any payment plan.  (At least in my experience)  I probably should not call it a payment plan so much as they will accept whatever money you send them so if you pay $25 a month, they will take it and will not report anything negative on your credit or pass your bill to debt collectors.  I would call the HTC and ask if they have a person that can advise you on seeing them without coverage.  I have been to a few and they have always been more concerned with my welfare over financial nonsense.  I even had nurses slipping recently expired Factor VIII to me on the DL when I lost insurance coverage for a while.  They have patient advocates that know ways around the system and even charities that may be able to help.  Sorry I cannot offer more but I am glad to hear you are managing better right now.  Plenty of smart guys in here that might have better advice.  Good luck. So maybe it is just my HTC, but do others not offer free comprehensive clinics? Mine offers one where you can come in, get seen by the doctors, physical and emotional therapist, dental hygienist, nutritionist, talk with career and school councilors, and social workers to help with all kinds of insurance issues.. it is all free, and they even pay for your gas, or pay for someone to drive you down. Ask the HTC if they have a social worker. They are generally good about helping with benefits questions  and other resources that might be available to you. If you do not need to go now you could always wait until after open enrollment and you are on a better plan. The only HTC that I have heard of being free are the ones in Taiwan and those are funded by Big Pharma since Factor is paid for by the government there. I live in Indiana, and from what Ive heard its the biggest HTC in the US, so that could be why. They recently had some Canadian HTC docs there learning about the place. Which they paid me $75 to go down there, so I was pretty happy with that.\n\nThey have a pharmacy there, and shuffle the profits back into the clinic. Thanks to IU medical college, Indy is actually pretty big in medicine. Rest of the state sucks, but for medical, Indy is pretty great.", "Happy World Hemophilia Day! Just wanted to wish you all well!

I got sport conditioning practice and just so i can be secure i wana see if i can do this. Ty Infusing every day usually should not be a problem, many do it before procedures. But before you do anything you should ask your hematologist or treatment center.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Join the community! HemoTalk.tk** Yea you can do that. Infusing too much is pretty hard to do. Unless you have to already combine two vials to hit your dose where you can just make that decision yourself it might be hard to get a dr to write you a second RX  for doses like that, and even trickier to get insurance to pay on something that they will most likely consider unnecessary, just saying. have you talked to your HTC about hemlibra? maybe that would be a better thing like hemlibra once or twice a week and your factor can maybe be reduced to less.... like instead of daily maybe every other day..... i dk\n\ngood luck. The answer to these questions will always be to talk to your treatment centre. They are the ones that track your treatment and develop a treatment plan. How the heck would we know what medication regimen would work best for you? The way I had it explained to me was that it seemed like they were very interested in measuring the trough level so it depends on what your trough level is like if you really do go on that modified regime. As long as your trough level is high enough, you are unlikely to develop spontaneous bleeds. Nurses and doctors at the HTC will have the formula memorised and if you are interested, you can ask them. Do not just change your dosing based on a hunch or dare. Double check the math.

I have been through a lot in my time here and some of my experiences may help someone else. I am a 32 year old Hemophiliac form Mississippi. I was diagnosed at birth and received a tainted blood transfusion that gave me hepatitis C at 5 years old. Growing up was tough for me as I could not do the things everyone else did. Everyone treated me as if I was super fragile and made me afraid to do anything. I tried sports, but was always too scared that I would get hurt to really be able to play. This lead me to want to try everything that people told me not to do. I tried every drug I could get my hands on and drank like a fish all through high school and  on into college. \n\nThe lifestyle landed me in the hospital once when I almost bled to death from a bleed in my abdomen. Then the lifestyle lead me to the only other possible outcome it could, prison. I have been to jail dozens of times for overnight stays, but prison was a different world all together. They refused me medication for 3 months. I was in solitary for 1 month when I got there. I was peeing straight blood as my kidneys were having to work hard to get rid of all the drugs in my system. By the time I actually got medicine after much litigation and threats from lawyers, I was black and blue down the whole right side of my body from laying on a steel rack for a month with no mattress. I served a year and got out. I went back to school and finished my degree in computer servicing and networking. Then I got out of school and could not find a job because of the felony conviction. \n\nI have always had bouts of depression and anxiety due to the hemophilia, and this did not help me with any of that, but I did it to myself so it kind of allowed me to make peace with it and keep going. After a few years of working odd jobs and drawing disability, I finally found a company to give me a shot. Started working and quickly rose to the top of the company becoming the highest paid person to ever work there. I had a drive that nobody else did because of what I had been through. I believe that this disease gives you that blessing. Everything is harder when you have hemophilia, but nothing is impossible. My target joints are my elbows and ankles. I battle with both daily. My elbows are both locked at about 90 degree angles from joint damage and radioactive happy idiot doctors. This causes much social anxiety as they are hard for me to hide. Most people think I broke them at one time and it gets old explaining it sometimes, but it is what it is. \n\nI have many more stories and believe that I can offer advice to various issues people face with hemophilia. I no longer have the hepatitis C as I went through treatment a coupe of years ago. I manage my own IT company now and also manage a security company that does cameras and alarms. Moral is not to let anything hold you back, and do not be afraid to live your life. If there is a stupid mistake someone could make, I more than likely made it and paid the consequences. I still do not take care of myself like I should. I use Kovaltry factor VIII now. I am on prophylaxis, but usually treat PRN. I rarely have bleeds and am up and down ladders a lot of days installing security equipment.\n\n I try to keep the disease in the back of my mind, I treat the anxiety and pain with CBD and medical marijuana. It is the best medicine I have found. I did the opiate thing and believe that is not an option at all to anyone. Sure it takes pain away at first, but stop taking it and see how that pain feels afterwards. My pain was always 10x worse after not having opiates for a day. It would even make it so bad I could not function. I even strongly considered cutting my arms off at times because it would be less painful. That stopped when I switched to marijuana, and stopped opiates completely. I have not had any opiates in several years. I do not look back at all. I hope this helps anyone going through some of the same things, anyone with any questions feel free to ask. Please add some paragraphs. It is really hard to read on mobile  done, sorry grammar and writing  was never a strong area for me No problem. Once you get to writing sometimes you dont realize how much information you actually put down lol I have the same target joints as you, although my elbows have not lost as much range of motion.\n\nCan you give more details about the CBD and marijuana you are using?  Form, dose, frequency, etc.?  Thanks so many things you wrote resonated with me. Stay strong, brother. Keep making progress.  My lack of range of motion is due only in a small part to bleeding. It is mostly due to a procedure I had done in my teens to help with bleeding. They shrank the synovial fluid sacks in my elbows with radioactive isotopes. Every since my arms have been locked up.  The cbd gummies really help the most with pain as far as CBD products go, but they put me to sleep. I use the 10mg gummies, 2-3 usually does it. If I am hurting real bad I will take them and smoke a bowl of a high thc indica. High dosage edibles does the same as well. Usually 100mg or so will put me down with no pain. The worse the pain the more I intake. I do not really dose as my tolerance is very high, just whatever gets me to where I need to be. It is not legal where I am, CBD is, but medical is not so I have to take what I can get there. The cbd salve works miracles on both joint and muscle bleeds.  The thc salve works even more, but it  is hard for me to find. Herb help me the most, the concentrates seem to make it worse as they cause me to cough excessively and that seems to intensify the pain briefly. Herb lasts longer as well. Vaping CBD helps with anxiety, but not pain. Vaping the thc carts like distillate helps some with pain, but cause excessive coughing sometimes if not careful. Blueberry is one of my favorite strains for night time pain. Sour diesel is a good one for during the day. As far as frequency, it is daily. If I am hurting when I wake up I smoke and it helps losen me up to start the day. I usually will not do it again until I get home. I am a pothead though so, my dosage and frequency will be different than others that take better care of themselves. I just know it helps like nothing else with little to no side effects. Everyone will have different dosage, just have to figure out what works for you.  As a fellow older hemophiliac, I would like to know your opinions about schools, particularly elementary and middle school.  How was school for you?  When you told other kids about hemophilia, what were their common reactions? \n\nFor me... let us just say learned to keep my mouth shut about it pretty fast because at that time (early 80s), school staff did not care and my mom was not about to file a lawsuit against the school for them ignoring the violent bullying of a hemophiliac to see who could make the biggest bruise.\n\nAlso, you say you got Hep C from the contaminated factor.  Has that any lasting effects on your liver?  Did you ever get any compensation from the companies that were sued over the HIV/Hemophilia debacle in the 80s? School for me was not too bad. I grew up in small schools in small towns and most teachers and administrators we are pretty receptive to my needs. I was blessed with a very persistent mother who took really good care of me and made sure I was taken care of everywhere I went. She went bat shit on people who treated me differently than everyone else. Mostly it was people thinking I was milking it for sympathy and excuse for missing class. That happened a lot, but I took it with a grain of salt and never let it bother me. I was never really bullied. I got caught with whiskey at school in the 7th grade, I was a legend ever since then and stayed in trouble with the law and everything else. I was a little crazy myself, especially when drinking and that was my reputation. First weekend I got my driver's license I went to jail for telling a group of cops to kiss my ass and then rolling up my window, locking the door, and flipping them off. Was not my proudest moment but rumors began to spread and the reputation was born. I was known as the crazy kid, few knew me as the hemophiliac. I always felt like I had to prove myself to everybody, and let the reputation create the monster that wound up in prison. I am very lucky to still be alive, as things got pretty wild for awhile. As for the hep c, it never caused me any issues except being diagnosed. The only issues was the idea of having it, the blood testing, and liver biopsies as I did 2 of them. Other than that I have had no issues with it even with the drinking and partying days. I was more than fortunate, and received way more blessing than I deserve. I did get a small settlement from the hep c but due to nondisclosure I cannot say the amount. All I can say is I only received a small portion of it. I did the harvoni treatment for 6 months back in 2015. Had no side effects or issues. I hardly ever drink now. Very rarely and in moderation. Getting rid of it really helped me appreciate life a lot more. I think the combination of everything had a lot to do with my rebelious youth.  My schools sucked, kids tormented me, Ryan White was a town over if that gives you an idea. The movie later meant to help, only fueled kids on worse. Most teachers especially once I got to middle and high school, just did not care. Gym sucked bc it is mandatory, so unless I wanted to gym with the mentally handicapped, I was forced to do everything same as normal kids. \n\nEventually I was expelled 2 months from graduation bc I had to have surgery before I was 18 in case insurance dropped me, despite being over the credit requirement, and was not allowed to return the year after. I had the same radioactive surgery you did on my elbow, I was one of the first ppl to have it, mine is locked up good as well. Had my knee and hip replaced, no range of motion in my ankles left, my shoulder and neck are breaking down, and my fingers are starting to lock up.\n\nPretty much tried everything under the sun, both legal and illegal, and finally found a good mix of opioids about 5 yrs ago. I take them responsibly, never had to increase. 10mg of methadone in the morning, and occassionally a Norco. Weed is not legal here, at all, we just finally allow alcohol on Sunday 3 weeks ago. I do not really like weed anyways and with a 3yr old I do not like being high around him bc weed makes me goofy and stupid. CBD oil is way too expensive, and just got legalized in very very small doses here last week. \n\nHad a few promising careers, but insurance was always a struggle and my physical condition took a toll since they were all physically demanding jobs that I was really good at and now I am on SSI.  I was in similar situation with schools.. I posted above, I grew up with Ryan White in the town over and it was a horrible time period. I got hep c as a very young child, but was a rare case and my body completely fought it off, and there is no detectable traces anymore to this day and it did no damage to my body. So I got extremely lucky, no money, but I would rather it be that way. Thanks for the reply.\n\nHere is some recent news you might be interested in:\n\n( Six months on Harvoni?  What subtype did you have?\n\nI had subtype 1a for probably 20 years longer than you and was cured by Harvoni over 12 weeks in late 2014/early 2015.\n\nMaybe I was just very lucky, but I am really glad I did not listen to doctors about liver biopsies or trying to treat Hep C prior to the current class of Hep C drugs.  It was not until Harvoni was approved that I learned that the old treatment method, ribavirin and peginterferon-alfa, had only something like a 10% cure rate for subtype 1a after six months to a year of pretty awful sounding side-effects. I do not remember my genotype exactly, but I do remember it being one of the more difficult ones to get rid of. I almost started the inferior treatments a couple of times hence the 2 biopsies, but backed out due to a not guaranteed success and terrible side effects since I was not having any problems except the idea that I had the disease.\n\n I believe the treat ment was 6 months, it may have been 12 weeks. It was so simple and no side effects I cannot remember how long I was on it. I know I had to go to the doctor a lot that year. I try to stay away from there as much as possible as I do not have very good experience with doctors. The doctors were always the worst part. I would always come home with bleeds after the doctors had been screwing with all my joints \"checking\" me.\n  I forgot to mention that I got my Harvoni treatment as part of ( This is not really a question, but since today is world Hemophilia day I figured I would stop by. Wednesday is the last day that I will spend 4-6 hours in a 40 degree cooler taking care of and pick, packing and shipping our Hemophilia Antihemophilic Factor overnight to wherever it needed to go. I spent the last 2 years, 4 days a week in that cooler taking care of the majority of domestic orders across the US, and have shipped out a couple thousand units as donations to certain places as well. I am moving to a better position at work but will still be keeping an eye on that process as it became my child. I just wanted to say, though I do not have hemophilia, working with the medicine everyday and learning so much about it from our R&amp;D team has given me a newfound respect for those that deal with this everyday.  I know we are working on a new recombinant factor VIII that will lessen the amount of dosages needed even more than our 2 current recombinant factors on the market and I hope it does well for you all. :)", "Need information regarding moving abroad for higher education Hi fellow bleeders, I am a severe haemophiliac with inhibitors from India. I want to move to abroad( developed countries obviously like usa, uk, Canada, France, Germany, etc) for higher study. \nTherefore, I want to know how I will be able to get factor in ur country? Does Hemophilia treatment and factor are covered by insurance for international student or not. \nIf it is covered then what is the procedure to get factor. Do I have to pay on top of insurance premiums or factors are basically totally covered in insurance so no out of pocket expenses.\nPlease help me decide whether to go for higher study or not.\nThank you In the UK Factor 8 is covered completely by the NHS. If you are also working, you will pay national insurance directly out of your paycheck every month (you will also have to pay a lump sum national health subsidy during the visa process). After this you will never have to pay for factor 8, or any other NHS treatment.\n\nYou will probably have to be referred to a haemophilia center by your GP - the center will then sort out your prescription. Go for it. I know many folks who are from India and have moved abroad for higher education despite of their hemophilia. I am going next year as well. \n\nYour insurance will cover everything and you should get prophylaxis by default. You will have to pay the insurance copay which is around 400 USD per month in US. You can look for financial aids that can help you with copay. Hi, first of all thank you for replying. Can I ask where are you from India and are u still in touch with those Hemophiliac who moved abroad. \nI have few more question, see I am in govt job here in India and is on Hemlibra prophylaxis. \nYou said that insurance will cover everything, how much will be the insurance premium for international student with Hemophilia or are you talking about university\u2019s insurance. In case of university insurance will it cover everything. And about the copay why where and when I will be needed to pay $400 per month as copay. Does not insurance should cover everything. Also can u tell me which insurance company are you talking about cuz I tried searching on internet about insurance for international student with hemophila could not get much info. \nAlso can we talk over phone you can Dm me ur number as I have so much to ask. \nThank you once again and I am happy that you are also thinking of moving abroad and not letting this disease stop you from achieving your dreams. My brother is a hemophiliac and he is coming to the US as well. The insurance is a nightmare to figure out and I am also currently struggling. But from what I understand so far the insurance covers 70-80% of the costs while the individual is responsible for 20-30%. These drugs are extremely costly so even those 20-30% can run upto 400+. Usually you will be required to buy insurance provided by your school so you will have to look at that policy and then understand what benefits it provides yo estimate your costs. National hemophilia helpline or hemophilia treatment centers can guide you if you call them", "Possibly have VWD type 1\u2026questions! Hi there. My blood tests came back as abnormal for VWD so my doctor is referring me to a hematologist. \n\nA little about me I am 20f and have really heavy periods and bruise very easily. \n\nMy questions are:\n\nIve tried so many types of birth controls from different pills to the IUD and hated everyone of them because of the side effects. Do I really need to be on BC because of VWD?\n\nI saw I should avoid certain medications like Tylenol or something? What ones do I avoid and which are safe to take?\n\nDo you guys take vitamins at all?? \n\nHow have your doctors treated your VWD?? Tylenol is fine. It is aspirin and ibuprofen (nsaids) that are problematic for bleeding. I am a male hemophiliac, so not qualified for your other questions :). Type 3 vWD here, do not have time to comment, I will be back in a bit! There is no \u201cneed\u201d to be on birth control pills. Personally I just did not want to deal with the excessive-ness of bleeding when I was younger. I was on BC for about 15 years. If it is really excessive bleeding to the point of anemia, it is a rather easy way to \u201cfix\u201d it. But ultimately up to you.\n\nAnd as the other commenter said, it is aspirin/Motrin/aleve etc you should minimize. Tylenol is perfectly fine. My hematologist's office has an OBGYN in their practice, I would highly recommend finding a similar situation and discussing your heavy periods with them.  I think most big teaching/research hospitals have solid hematology departments, and it is absolutely worth traveling to get knowledgeable care.  Plus, most will do telehealth now once you are established. Type 1 VWB here. I needed the BC for many reasons, mainly managing flow, but secondarily pregnancy. I was on the pill and it was fabulous. \nTylenol is safe, but like other posters mentioned stay away from ibuprofen and aspirin.  \nPM me if you want to chat, I am now in my 40\u2019s and have been living with VWB for over 20yrs. Okay! \n\nWelcome to the club fellow bleeder! I have type 3 severe vWD and I was diagnosed at 9m old. I started off with fresh frozen plasma as a kid, but as I got older I started injecting Humate (a factor replacement). If you are a type 1, it is possible you will only need DDAVP (a nasal spray) when you have any sort of bleeding. With pregnancy, your von willebrand factor naturally goes up, but comes back down post partum so you may receive factor as a precaution.\n\nFor vitamins and supplements, talk to your hematologist about anything you would consider taking. (\n\nYou do not HAVE to be on any sort of pill or shot, but it can be helpful when it comes to our heavy menstrual cycles. I have flat out refused an IUD. I have talked to several women with vWD of all severities and of the roughly 100 I spoke to, around 5 liked them, and the rest had awful experiences with it. On the severe end, some would bleed them out.\n\nI have been on some form of birth control since I was 13/14. The smallest dose. I went off at 16 and bleed so much I needed a blood transfusion. Personally, I do not mind taking birth control. I have not had much issue with it. I just change pills every few years as my body gets used to it and I start to bleed heavy again. As a 34 year old now, I have had more issues with my uterus due to endometriosis and adenomyosis. Not bleeding disorder related, but makes it difficult to find solutions that are safe for us.\n\nIn Canada, we have a Bleeding Disorders program that consists of an annual appointment with your care team. For me, I meet with the nurses, hematologist, physiotherapist, social worker, and any med student that is following for the day. At these appointments, we discuss any issues we are having with injuries, general health and wellbeing. I have gotten referrals to specialty gynecologists, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, and whatever they think would be helpful to me.\n\nThere are also organizations that can be super helpful when dealing with a new diagnosis. There is ( ( ( and much more.\n\nAs for pain management, acetaminophen is safe for us (Tylenol). Any other NSAIDS are not, like Aleve, Motrin, Aspirin, ibuprofen. The issue with those NSAIDS, is that it affects our ability to clot and with vWD we are more susceptible to mucus membrane bleeding (nose, mouth, gastrointestinal, vaginal and anal).\n\nAnyway, this is stupid long and I hope I have not scared you too much!

", "Been looking for somewhere I can ask this Hello all, I am trying to find other people with hemophilia that can maybe answer a question. I have hemophilia A and I infuse factor 8 as needed now and hemlibra 1 time a week. I have noticed when I have a bleed and I infuse my factor, the area with the joint bleed hurts more for 1-2 hours then before then after everything will just go away for good after that. My question is does this happen to anybody else? If yes does anybody know why it happens? Is it physical or mental? This has always happened so it is not really a new issue either. Happens to me, too. For me it is usually 12 hours or so it hurts. Do not know exactly why, but maybe it is because a clot has formed and now there is something that can be \"pulled\" in the joint, like how an incision that is healing can hurt when the skin is stretched? I did not even think that the blood has to go back \ud83d\ude02 now I am wondering how I thought it just like poof gone when I was a kid Probably takes that long for the factor to start working and clots to start forming at the site of the bleed Sorry making sure I am reading it right. So your saying the pain would be the clots forming at the site right after injection correct? Cuz that is just how I interpreted the comment I am not on hemlibra but when I have bleeds in my legs, especially my feet, it gets immediately more painful for an hour or 2 after factor 8 infusion. I have not noticed any new or increase pain while on hemlibra. I also infuse factor 8 as needed, and hemlibra once a week. \n\nI have been on it two years. I have gone from having probably 20+ bleeds a year to 1-2. If you are having bleeds or what you think may be bleeds, I implore you to talk to your HTC or hematologist. You should not be having bleeds on hemlibra. \n\nNot a doctor. I think your mis understanding the question. the hemlibra plays no part in this. It is just when I have a bleed and use factor like normal. I was just providing backstory ish I am not on hemlibra, currently profydosing.\n\nTo answer your question, as a kid my infusions were always as needed. It was not until I was 11-12 that insurance companies were willing to pay for preventative infusion. It took me 2 decades to start taking my meds as prescribed. I have always noticed an increase in pain within hours of infusing after a bleed. About 10-15 years ago I brought this up with my doctor.\n\nShe told me that she had other patients that described the issue, but it was the minority. At the time she was not aware of any studies into it and could not answer if it was psychosomatic or a true symptom. I never followed up on the question, but I am encouraged by your comment and feel better about my personal experience. Imma ask my doctor as well just to get a second opinion and I will get back to you on this because this is getting bigger than I thought \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I do have some long term damage to my knee because of excessive bleeds so that also could be playing some role in it as well but yes I am very curious now I know there is is a group with the issue \ud83d\ude05 I also have Hemophilia A and for a little bit I took both factor8 and was on Hemlibra weekly. I definitely experienced some pain while infusing F8, The bigger the bleed the longer it would hurt afterwards. Strangely though I experienced pain more often while just on F8 before I got approved for Hemlibra. My case was a little different as I had multiple ports for most of my life until just after I turned 24. Weirdly while on my last port I would actually experienced short term light fevers after infusing while I was on 3x a week which made the pain worse. No I mean you are continually bleeding internally, right after you inject because it takes time to start working Let us know what they say! I used my super googling skills but did not fina my additional info last night. Very curious to know if it is all in my head or not \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05 This is a really interesting discussion to me.  I am Factor 8 and not on Hemlibra. And I have not noticed the effect described.  I am wondering, if it is not impacted by the effort of getting yourself to the kitchen table or other infusion location? Or getting the medicine out of where ever you keep it? I keep mine in a basement fridge, so it is an extra flight of stairs. \n\nBut if I am not wrong, it is the swelling in the hemorrhaging joint that causes the pain.  If you have to move more, it might cause a bit more bleeding or just movement of an already swollen joint that might account for the 1 or 2 hours of extra pain.  But it should certainly be reported to the HTC. I am still weighing whether to get on Hemlibra.  I might start another thread on that and ask opinions. But it would not explain an increase in the pain directly after injection Personally I have noticed a massive reduction being on hemlibra for 18 months now. And it does not involve moving at all. It is more of just a concentrated pain just sitting there. As a kid I always thought the paid right after was the factor \u201cworking\u201d but idk. More often then not it becomes like a heartbeat pulse kind of pain I had 2 in my life and I got the 2nd one out at I think 15 (24 now) I have been noticing a overall pain reduction after being put on hemlibra. The fever thing sounds like it may have been starting an infection though so glad your all good. I am wired I have always preferred the vain in my hands An uncontrolled bleed continues to get more and more painful because it is constantly increasing in swelling, therefore it is going to keep hurting after injection until the keds have time to start working and blood / inflammation leaves the area.\n\nAt least that is how I have always understood it and it made sense to me Same for me, yeah, I guess it is because when you took the infusion, the joint was bleeding real hard so it needed time to stop even with the help of factor 8", "Does anyone else get weirded out when a TV or a movie character is revealed to be a hemophiliac?

Obviously I am dealing it with extra factor but was wondering do other people have the same problem ? I have had this happen 3/4 times over the last few years and mostly is just a nuisance.  I have not have this happen I was all ready to suggest you were bitten by a pretty gnarly spider instead of a mosquito, but then you said it is happened multiple times. \n\nI have a tough time accepting that mosquito bites can cause bleeds on their own, you do not try scratching them with a hammer or anything right? While I have never gotten a bleed from an insect bite, I have seen my non-hemophiliac partner swell up massively to mosquito bites. Do you know if you are \u201callergic\u201d to mosquitos? Any other insect bites causing bleeds?\n\nI could see an allergic reaction develop into a bleed if your skin is already swelling severely. I am allergic to Mosquito bites and have to be very careful about scratching them because mine will bleed easily (vWd). But they have never bled enough to become a worry. I have an allergic reaction to mosquitos within 1 minute after they bite me.   It is bad if I see one that is full of my blood.  Swells up to a 1/2 dollar size, but it is not a bleed.   I would really like to see a pic of OP's bite bleed.  Very unusual...   AFAIK mosquitos inject an anticoagulant when they bite so they can easily get blood, so I guess depending on how it is they get you, it is possible it leads to something bigger.  Not in 37 years as a severe A.  Normally superficial injuries like mosquito bites are not a problem for hemophilia.  Is your Von Willebrand factor normal.", "No medicine until tomorrow.

I am considering applying for them myself but was curious about the process and how hard it was for you to apply and get approved. \n\nI have type A severe and while I am physically not as bad off as some hemophiliacs with hemophilia related complications. I have several joints that are problematic. Ankles, right knee that had surgery when I was five, my left shoulder, etc. im getting older now (30) and I have started noticing more and more of a decline in my problem joints. I am missing the odd day of work here and there and I am having to reduce my work load. My job is fairly physical. Lifting heavy stuff squatting and standing. In general the usual types of pains and problems one with severe hemophilia would expect. I am in need of at-least one ankle surgery but currently cannot afford to miss work long enough to even attend to the one joint seeing as I do not get paid time off at my job.\n\nMy girlfriend has been saying I should apply for sometime now and I think I have finally reached the conclusion myself that I am not going to get any better. So the double edged sword that I am inquiring about is the monthly income that is referenced on the ssa site that says if you make more than 1220 you generally cannot be considered disabled. I make more than that a month and while I do not have many expenses, I cannot afford to stop work as it is my means to pay for the health insurance that covers my ridiculously expensive medications. As well as my means of transportation. \n \nTl;dr is it possible to get on disability while still making over the 1220 monthly? I would naturally stop struggling through work after approval. But was curious about the process and if it was possible to get approval before being unable to work. \n\nTia! Regardless of the possibility of you getting disability benefits, you should disclose where you are from, and what currency. We cannot help you if we do not know the laws involved. Good call. I am from Canada in Ontario for me applying was as easy as get forms, get doctor to sign and provide required documents and then just bring them in or send them in. On the topic of income I know here they just take 50 cents off your check for every dollar you make after a certain amount. unfortunitly not very versed in US disability procedures but should be something similar Im worried about eligibility if I can even get it as I am still working and earning more than that. They evidently prefer you to be unable to work as opposed to I am going to be unable to work soon. Such a confusing mess to navigate. Probably need to get an attorney since it is not so cut and dry for a hemophiliac. From what iv just read you unfortunitly may not qualify do to income (limit seems to be 1090$ USD per month in florida) but otherwhise you qualify do to being considered to have a disability or life threatening condition for more then a year\nI would look into SSA and there DDD program if it is still going as DDD seems to check if you qualify Does your HTC employ a social worker?\n\nThey may be more familiar with the laws and processes that you will have to deal with in your state. I do not even have an HTC in my area but the nhf might be a place to start. We were at an inhibitor summit for my son earlier this year, and went to several sessions about insurance and assistance management.\n\nThere is a whole legal team that battles for better coverage care and helping folks navigate signing up for the right assistance.\n\nI hope they can help you figure how to get support. You might want to check out the (  They have a legal hotline that may be able to help you navigate a federal disability claim. I do not think you will need an attorney. You should be able to find someone familiar with the laws just by going into your local SSI office or whichever office you get referred to. They will at least tell you what your options are. I was on SSI disability at one point and it covered my insurance (medicaid) and I was paid $700/mo. But I could not make more than $300/mo on top of that. So in my case, because it was disability I was not allowed to work. It was the only way I could afford or qualify for insurance at the time, so I took it. It was a hassle for sure, dealing with the paperwork and reviews every 6 months, and trying to stay inside of their requirements I was not supposed to accept gifts or own more than 1 car, I stretched it with a beater motorcycle. It was always difficult dealing with the paperwork and requirements, but I honestly think an attourney might just make it more difficult, and expensive. Maybe there are attourney a who specialize or are healthcare advocates, but I still would use that as a last resort. Try to get in touch with a social worker through NHF, maybe they will have some advise. But do not overthink it. This process is just some extra work. Be patient and take it one step at a time and you will likely be able to figure something out.

For context, I am a 24yo male with Type A Severe (with inhibitors). 2 years after that post, I am still on HemLibra and I am pleased to say that in 2.5 years total of being on the drug, I have still only had 1 bleed (as I was transitioning from Feiba to HemLibra at the beginning). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to make a post so that people who are experiencing similar issues could reference my experience with ankle pain and decide for themselves whether distraction is an option they should pursue. When I began looking for surgical options to relieve my pain, I was shocked at how few options were given to me by the first couple of doctors I pursued. I ended up seeing 5 orthopedists in total, 4 of whom were ankle specialists - this is *absolutely crucial* when you are dealing with an outlook requiring surgery that could preclude you from other options down the road. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, I ended up choosing Dr. Austin Fragomen at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan NYC, and received an external fixator on 12/4/2020. I am currently 4 weeks from my fixator removal date, and will take questions (maybe even a followup post) about the operation and my recovery if anyone has them.\n\nHere is some things I learned:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. When dealing with arthropathy, fusing an ankle joint will (most likely, but not always) eliminate a total ankle replacement or ankle distraction as an option in the future. Ultimately it is still possible to surgically cut/break open a previously fused joint, but the sentiment expressed to me by my doctors was that this is a difficult &amp; uncommon procedure - it is typically an irreversible decision for most patients. There are merits to ankle fusions such as reduced/eliminated pain &amp; \n2. Total Ankle Replacements were not an option to me due to my age (24 now). Even the best ankle replacement prosthesis hardware has a shelf life of \\~15 years (give or take a few years due to activity level, weight, other factors). I was told ankle replacements are mostly suggested to those in the 40-50+ crowd. \n3. Ankle Distractions do not burn the bridges for either of these secondary procedures down the road. Ultimately my ankle will have to be operated on again later in life due to how bad it is, but this procedure in my case MAY buy me anywhere from 4-16 years of reduced pain. This is an outcome I am willing to risk, given how severe my quality-of-life restrictions were prior to the surgery.\n\nFor those of you who may want to do more educational reading on ankle distractions, here is some material I located before going through with my surgery.\n\n(\n\n( \n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbove all, my advice to anyone considering this as an option to help with ankle pain is this: **do your research NOW, and act swiftly. Do not procrastinate.** Had I gotten this surgery 2-3 years ago when I first exhibited symptoms of ankle arthrodesis, my outlook would be significantly better than it will be now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions (via comment so future readers can see). Thanks for sharing. I was not aware this even existed. Unfortunately, I suspect I am too far gone for my own joints but hopefully someone else here will benefit. I did not know this was an option either. Thank you so much for sharing i have a whole new topic to discuss with my Orthopedist. I was concerned I was too far gone as well. I had 3+ years of significant chronic pain, and the subtalar joint in my ankle autofused from arthritis. I was still a candidate for this surgery, so on the chance it is not too late for you, do not be afraid to explore every option. Good luck on your journey I saw an ankle specialist and he told me basically the same thing about the fusion. I am 26 with some pretty bad arthropathy in my left ankle plus I am a nurse, so being down that long plus limiting mobility/ROM is not something he recommended at this time. However, I started taking Celebrex 100mg once a day before any heavy activity such as work and it has helped tremendously. I no longer suffer from the pain I used to. \n\nI have come to terms with the fact I will need surgery in the future, but for right now, this medication will hold me over until I graduate from grad school and get a less active job. I too was on Celebrex for about 1.5 years before I noticed it did not help any more. It seems to differ between people. Congratulations on getting some relief and best of luck with whatever option you choose! I am 31 and my ankle problems started at 13 with a bone cystic legion. I am completely against fusion after talking to non hemophiliacs about how they said it did nothing but make everything else hurt and I too am young for a replacement. I cannot offer much advice other than do not use drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, that just causes your life to go to shit as I went that route. \n\nThere has been some research on stem cells and other types of injections into the joint to alleviate pain and try to rebuild the surface of the joint so that may be something for you to inquire about. \n\nWhat I do now is meditate and keep active while drinking pineapple juice(lubricates joints) and taking a daily vitamin which supports joint health. Still sucks but not as bad as it used too. What happened to cause this original issue with your ankle? Does it make noises when you rotate it? What exactly does the fixator accomplish? Surely it will not grow you new cartilage? How can it push a bone like talus back into its original place and just stay there?\n\nI have had three ankle surgeries, they tried to insert a cadaver ligament to keep my ankle joint from moving apart initially and that did not work. I am 38 and have a 70 year old ankle after an accident.\n\nCan you walk eventually with a fixator? How long before you can go back to work and walk around with it on? I assume you have to wear wide leg pants or shorts for months. From what I was told, there is actually new tissue growth on the head of the bones - it is not technically cartilage, but it functions as friction reducer so essentially serves the same purpose. I do not have the same level of knowledge as the actual doctors &amp; surgeons, but i am 3 months post frame removal and the results are real. \n\nI was in a fixator that had a hinge, so I was moving my ankle the entire time it was in the fixator for additional blood flow &amp; to prevent atrophy. My doctor allowed me to bear weight on the ankle even while the fixator was still on, and by the end of the 3 month period I was walking with the fixator. There are no pants that will fit a fixator, i had to wear tear-off track pants with snaps for 3 months. Unfortunate, but still worth it. Hey op! How you doing?\n\nI was just diagnosed with arthritis in my ankle at 11 months post -op from trimalleolar fracture. \n\nI am considering going straight into getting ankle distraction surgery Hey! Honestly, 11 months out from original surgery and 9 months out from frame removal - results are AMAZING in my opinion. My functional ability has improved greatly, and my ankle has regained approximately 2.0mm of \u201ccartilage\u201d (not real cartilage, but soft joint tissue described to me by my surgeon as \u201cfunctionally similar to cartilage\u201d). My results have been stellar and my surgeon is hopeful that this means it will continue to improve until approximately 1-1.5 years from the frame removal date.

I am currently taking Eloctate, which, last I could find, is at around 1.98 USD/unit (hooray co-pay assistance programs).  \n\nI am hoping someone in another country is either taking Eloctate or a similar product for A just to tickle my own personal curiosity spot, but any info at all would be more than I have and would also be greatly appreciated!  I am also curious how those fancy single-payer healthcare plans that most places outside of the good old U.S. of A treat bleeders on prophylaxis, any availability issues/reductions in treatment frequency?\n\nAgain, really any info would be golden, I am baffled at how little there is readily available. I get my treatment through the NHS in the UK, feel very lucky as I do not have to pay anything. Are you talking just about price to the consumer? More the price set by the companies, I know that the actual consumer price will vary insanely given insurance policies It is not easy finding prices, particularly outside the US.  What I have done in the past is look at the websites for the national payers in each country.  NHS in UK, etc.  You will have to dig a lot, but they usually post the prices they pay.\n\nFrom what I have seen the prices for FVIII are much lower in Australia and the U.K. Since they use a tender system.  They basically ask each company to provide their lowest cost and select the cheapest option (or the two cheapest). If you are a patient in those countries you have to take that product unless you have a really good reason why you cannot.\n\nFVIII prices are around $1.50 per IU in the US, but can be as cheap as $0.50 per IU in the U.K. and Australia. Russia (thank God, I do not pay):\nFeiba 500 ME - 24000 rub (400$ approximately) \nOctanate (octapharma) 1000 ME - 5000 rub (83$ approximately) ", "Anyone on Xyntha, Factor VIII? I had my first infusion of Xyntha. It did not feel that effective. I usually feel less muscle ache after infusion but this time, close to nothing. Is that normal? I took xyntha for years and always had the relief you are describing. I injected so many times I do not remember if EVERYTIME it would give me that relief, so I would not worry about it if you do not feel it this one time. \n\nAlso if you are ever truly concerned over the efficacy of your medicine, do not post on Reddit. Call your HTC or doctor and discuss it with them, they can tell you much more confidently whether your worries are legit or not. There is really no choice. They are only going with Xyntha for the near future. Seeking feedback to ask if anyone else noticed a decrease in the efficacy of the medication and whether if it is a good idea to explore increasing the dose at my next appointment. Just to clarify, I am not shitting on Xyntha. Questions to increase your dose do not need to be tested on Reddit, ask your HTC and stick to what they tell you. \n\nThere is no doctors on this subreddit, and even if there are, giving you advice based off of a Reddit posts is a recipe for disaster. I am not trying to shit on your post, but the nature of your concerns are well above what Reddit is capable of helping you with.\n\nAnd yes you should always explore increasing your does or anything else with your HTC, never be afraid to discuss anything and everything with them. They are your doctors and they are there to help you, you should always feel comfortable asking them anything. What is your issue? If the answer to questions is just ask your HTC then what are we even here for?\n\nAlso my question was for haemophiliac's reaction to the new factor I have been prescribed. Why are you so touchy about that? I do not have any issues and I am not being touchy, I just cannot answer your question better than what I have already done. \n\nThis is a support subreddit for hemophilia. It is for posting updates on new medicine and gene therapies, as well as to provide support to other hemophiliacs. That is what I am trying to do here. \n\nI said in my original response that I have taken xyntha, have felt the same relief you felt from it, but cannot remember if I felt it every time, so ask your HTC.\n\nSorry I did not give you the answer you wanted I guess? They should be doing a factor activity level when starting a new med.  Trough level, 1 hour post dose, 8 hour post dose, 24 and 48 to see what % you are at. Are they not testing you? I used for a year or two and never really had any issues I can think of. They switched me to Adynovate because its longer lasting No. No testing. Sounds pretty odd... how do they know its working? I guess they do not? They have switched between several products in the past and some factors were definitely more effective than others.

The latter implies some sort of direct effect to hemophilia.", "A peak vs trough debate...  Debate? Your article pretty much covers it. Your statements are simply right, and there is not much to debate. Besides wether the well being of a hemophiliac is worth the money, which is debatable by some I guess, but not me. It is inhumane to let someone suffer when the medicine exists. It is not a matter of what we know is best for hemophiliacs, which is to receive proper treatment if they desire, it is a matter of how many millions of dollars the drug company CEO\u2019s get as a Christmas bonus. So many hemophiliacs are  led to believe they should feel guilty for the cost of their treatment, that they do not deserve to be treated properly because of the cost. This might sound extreme, but if it was not this way this article would not have been written. I do not think the debate is as simple as where someone is factor level should be. It should be as high as possible. Or as high as they can afford, or are capable of  maintaining with treatment. There are so many other , deeper , more complex conundrums that are at the heart of the issue. And they have to do with the cost of treatment. Like you said. It is not a health debate, it is a money debate. And beyond that it is a matter of assigning a value to one\u2019s life and to putting a fair price on suffering. It sucks being put in the position we are put in. I feel guilty that the shot it takes to keep me well costs me, or somebody $2000 every other day. I cannot possibly be worth that much. It is a weird place to exist when you think about it.  So we spend our lives jumping through insurance hoops and SSI disability hoops and Medicaid hoops , caged by the system that is set up to help, as well as by disability, the whole time feeling ashamed for needing such expensive help. Anyway, now I am complaining. My point is made: it is clear what the treatment should be, the rest is a matter of your level of compassion. I may be more confused after writing this than I was to begin with. I hope you are too. I cost just over 1000 a day, my peak levels are only 32-40% during the day but my TROUGH is 7-10%, turning me from a severe to a mild at my worst. My Qol is decent however i still struggle with anxiety and frequent infusion schedules, but if hemophiliacs can have mild level trough levels, breakthrough bleeds very seldom occur Yes I agree... there is not a day I infuse when I do not have the words \u201cyou are wasting expansive medication\u201d in my head. This year Advate and one hemoB drug have patents that are up. They will probably be extended, but it would be interesting to see what happened if it was open for a competitor to make the generic form.. would that lower costs and improve access? Well said!\ud83d\ude4c\n\nStarted this week my prophylaxis, mostly because had a kid 15 days ago, and now it is better to have my values above my \"normal\".\n\nI have severe Hemophilia A with less then 1% in paper, in real life it is not that bad. Don`t know if it is they way handle all my day, but sometimes I could get 6/7 months without any bleeding.\n\nIT is all about the money, not just the medicine for our condition, but the medical industry dont think about the patients, there really gold it is to be valued and earn money.\n\nWould like to think otherwise, but really dont think that is going to change. We live in a bitter and greedy world, we could try to change that, but imo we cannot!\n\nLet us see how this goes. All the best for you friend.\n\nCheers \ud83d\ude4c Other things to consider are the r&amp;d dollars the various companies have to invest to create and bring new drugs to market. Think 10 years ago when there was literally a small handful of options, now how many do we have? Regardless it does not justify the high cost, just something f to keep in mind. Congrats on becoming a father! Our kids definitely motivate us to care for ourselves! Did you have a girl or boy? \n\nI always find it strange that factor levels and bleeds do not always correlate. I am mild but bleed more like moderate or severe, especially in menopause. Women\u2019s levels often drop then. \n\nI also used to be able to go many mo this or even over a year without a bleed... lately it is been monthly even with prophy. \n\nI agree... the issue is larger than factor companies and whenever any company profits off healthcare or profits off people being sick, there is a struggle between those with the \u201cpower\u201d of the needed meds and those without financial resources to access them. \n\nI wish you the best in fatherhood and I hope you stay healthy so you can keep up with your new little one! Good point. The question is what will happen when the exclusivity patents expire on some of these meds. At that point r/d is supposed to be recouped. What will the prices look like?\n\nAdvate is up this year... I wonder if the patent will be extended or if it will be able to be made into a \u201cgeneric\u201d drug now. And would you trust a generic blood product? Also the cost of drugs (in the US anyway) seems to be based on the competition. I think there is a status quo to be maintained. But hopefully things will change somehow. It is crazy the way it is now. Trough and peak debates are old and passe\u2019.  Toddlers and small boys live on their troughs.  They have a steady state of activity and do not really have peak bleeding risk periods.  Older you get, the more varied your life becomes and the more you live on your peaks. It will be interesting to see if they let the Advate patent expire and any generics come on the market. I think the shrinking market for Advate with the extended half life factors and emicizumab will prevent any generics from happening. Most companies will not find it profitable..at least in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have debated the peaks and troughs before. I am on Elocate which is nice for infusing only twice a week. At same the time I liked having peaks more often with Advate to go to the gym and workout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever works the best for your situation. Are patents the reason why Factor VIII is so costly? \n\nI have been on some nationally produced (other country) Factor VIII from human plasma and the price is not significantly different from Advate which I am taking now. I think research and development of the drugs for a small population is what drives cost up. That said, the insane profit has a lot of players in a very small market so I do have to wonder if it is out of control.", "Covid Vaccine with VWD? Hi everyone!

Currently waiting on screening to see if I am a carrier - both uncles on my mother's side was/were effected by Type A hemophilia, although luckily my brother was not. Being a first time mom is already scary enough but I would like to prepare my husband and myself to care for a young one with hemophilia and would love some suggestions. How did you feel most supported by your parents? What are some ways you coped? I know this can be pretty deep for some but I want to make sure my son has the best life regardless of adversities.\n\nTL;DR What advice would you give to a parent of a child with hemophilia?  I remember the day we found out, it was a hard day but we were going to have him and love him regardless of what was to come, we just wanted to know before hand to prepare. My wife had an amniocentisis at 36 weeks to confirm, and was found that our son was affected. \n\nWe used this along with our HTC to guide delivery options. Vaginal delivery is safer if everything goes smoothly is what the literature says, but what if he gets stuck, what if there are complications. Things we had to consider carefully. On an unaffected child they would use forceps or a vacuum to help aid delivery. With a hemophilia this could cause some cranial bleeding. We opted for planned c section which to us was more controlled and less likely to cause any bleeding for our son. \n\nAdvice for you guys - learn up on as much as you can before hand so when things arise you will be better prepared. Seek out a local HTC and get materials as well as advice. Just because you are a carrier (if tests come back positive) does not mean he will be affected. It is a 50/50 chance as the affliction lies on the X chromosome and you are only giving one of the 2 you have to him. \n\nAs he grows and gets bigger you will see that the first year is kind of like the honeymoon phase, does not move around a whole lot so not a lot of bleeds. As he gets walking it may be decided it is time to start treating prophylactically. This is a good thing, do not let a few minutes of pain caused let you down as it will prevent days of pain if he had a bleed. Get on prophylaxis as soon as you are able as it makes a huge difference. Option is there for a port to be inserted as well but in our case we did not go this route as we would be trying to manage clotting factors with anticoagulants and to us was not worth the risk. \n\nSupport will be a big thing to rely on. Reach out to family, friends, HTC, even Reddit when you have Qs or a rough go about things. The best thing you can do is not worry. The medications have gotten so much better in the last 20 years and we are on the brink of a cure that he will see in his lifetime. \n\nIf you have any specific Qs let me know and I can try and answer from my experience or others can answer from their own. :) 1. Go straight to your nearest NHF/HFA chapter. They will have plenty of resources. This sort of thing is what they do and they are very good at it.\n\n2. Modern hemo moms are actually *kind of fucking insane* and the only thing you should gain from any interactions with them are models for how *not* to raise your kid. Be a mom, not a martyr.\n\n3. Hemlibra is now fully-approved in the US and gene therapy is making inroads. You will potentially be amongst those raising the first generation of hemophiliacs who are not reliant on IV treatment or factor. Our experiences can guide you to some extent but you will have a chance to basically write a completely new playbook. Find and call the nearest HTC (Hemophilia Treatment Center). They will set you up with everything you need, discuss everything essential with you and help you out with what will be needed.\n\nNext, do not be worried. Hemophilia is very manageable now-a-days. New medications are releasing quite often, advancements are being made and it is not something to really worry about; just to be aware of.\n\nDo not coddle your kid or make them feel any different. They are normal, with one small change that they just need to be aware of and they will learn when/if they have a bleed. My parents treated me like a normal kid, just with the additional awareness that if I hurt myself or have certain feelings in my muscles/joints, I would need a treatment. Make sure you look into good insurances such as Medicaid. Do your research, which most HTCs will assist with. Thank you so much for your response! If he is diagnosed, I hope that he can help those like my uncle and cousin! Were you guys concerned with the chance of miscarriage with the amnio or did you find it was worth the risk to find out early? Luckily there is a center here in Jax that can offer support! I hope that I can be a bad ass mom who can keep the family centered. I am a teacher for children on the spectrum so I already have some pretty amazing patience and hope I can let my little one run around without being a complete basket case all the time. That was why we waited until 36 weeks. If there were any complications with the amniocentisis there was not a chance that we would lose him :)\nI think it was definitely worth it. Gave us a plan that was well thought out and gave us time to prepare mentally as well. My mum drove me nuts as a child, but now as an adult I can see she was only ever looking out for me. I will say this though, home-schooling can be an option (which I do not recommend because of my own experiences with it) but if you do go down that route, make sure he is involved in lots of activities and can make friends with other kids. I did not have that option and I was a really lonely kid until I finally went to school at the age of 16, only to be bullied and ostracised because I was socially awkward. \n\nOften the psychological aspects of living with haemophilia/caring for a person with haemophilia are overlooked, I would say have some plan in place for dealing with that as well, both for yourself and your son (when he is old enough of course!)\n\nPS: Congratulations on your pregnancy! &gt;I am a teacher for children on the spectrum so I already have some pretty amazing patience\n\nOh gosh that makes you more qualified to be a decent mother to a hemophiliac than 75% of the hemomoms you see online.\n\nJust remember that if he is mild you basically *do not have anything to worry about*, if he is moderate your still pretty much fine, and if he is severe there are now once-a-week, no-IV-injection-eeded drugs that can make him a mild.\n\nThe community is weird as fuck because there are the crazy moms who can only prove their parental bona-fides by out-freedoming the others (\"I let *my* kid play soccer\" \"well I let *mine* play football\" \"well I let *mine* do full-contact MMA\"), the older hemophiliacs who were kind of emotionally destroyed by the tainted blood scandals and this is all they have to identify themselves, the slightly-younger hemophiliacs who think that they can only prove their worth through excessively performative masculinity, etc. Listen to their advice, smile politely, and ignore all of it. Truly I never let it affect my life I have severe hemophilia and I was pretty much taught to just be mindful that I have it. I always second guess activities that I know can get rough but I was never kept inside I was always allowed to do why my brother did except certain sports like football and lacrosse. Other than that you would never guess that I have sever hemophilia unless I tell you. And I only ever tell my best friends because people always treat you different they are like scared to touch you cause they think just touching will bruise you.  Talk with your OB GYN about getting a factor level from your baby's umbilical cord blood.  This will get you an accurate assessment of his factor 8 activity without drawing blood on him.   \n\nGet plugged into the local Hemophilia Treatment Center (you can find the closest one to you using the search engine on the CDC site or ( (NHF).\n\nGet plugged into the local chapter of the NHF and network with new parents.  \n\nYou want a pediatric hematologist, but more importantly, you want to have a pediatric hematologist that does hemophilia (not brain tumors or bone marrow transplant,etc) If I ever became that mom I would have to just off myself! \n\nYeah, I think that is why I am so concerned because both of my uncles were severe and lived with it through the 50s onward. My one uncle contracted HIV back in the 80s and eventually passed from choosing not to take his medication while my still-living uncle is basically metal from the waist down. Surprisingly enough he is in his mid 60's but is wheelchair-bound and to the point where I would never ask him to get tested to find the specific location of the gene mutation for my own genetic testing... It is very difficult for him to leave the house. This is the only life I know of hemophiliacs so it is a relief to talk to many of you, I truly appreciate the input.  Yes, I have plans for the genetic testing in January. Will go from there if it turns out I am a carrier and probably opt for amino closer to the due date like /u/HowInTheF suggested.  Good plan. \ud83d\udc4d &gt;If I ever became that mom I would have to just off myself!\n\nI am no longer welcome on a certain FB group because I had the audacity to make a similar statement (became -&gt; had) to a hemomom who was trying to argue that football does not cause brain damage. Their loss!\n\nThe difference in QoL between hemophiliacs born in the 60's up through the early 80's (who were affected most by the HIV crisis) and around 1985 (when I was born) is staggering - the difference between my generation and your son's might as well be like being born on Earth vs. being born on a Mars colony post-terraforming. Hemophilia is obviously serious but do not be too worried. Your child will miss out on some stuff but generally his day to day life will be normal. \n\nEducate yourself on the things he can and cannot do. He is born with the condition so missing out on activities will not be easy but he will not know any different \n\nIt seems you are already working to be an educated, loving, supportive mom.  He is lucky for that and things will work out fine with his hemophilia as a result  There is prophylaxis treatment now (which means you inject Factor VIII according to a schedule even without bleeds) and I have seen Haemophiliac body builders, construction workers and even phys ed instructors.

Unfortunately my husband\u2019s insurance (CDPHP), which we would have to switch to for the year, does not cover hemlibra. Does anyone have any experience getting hemlibra covered through another organization? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! Congrats on the newborn! (: Keep him safe.\n\nThe Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) should have a social worker that can help. They primarily focus on insurance issues and can go over your options.\n\nHemlibra\u2019s website does have a few links, as well.  I will ask about a social worker! They directed me to a nurse and she was not terribly helpful. I was surprised because they have been wonderful otherwise. \n\nAnd thank you for the links! Those look promising! Ask your HTC about possible Medicaid options. Here in Michigan, we have the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services - Children's Special Healthcare that fully pays for my treatments (Eloctate and Hemlibra), if my primary does not pick them up. 100% covered. It is one reason I will never move out of the state and I am an adult and still get to keep it for life. Oh this is great to know!!! I will look into this option tomorrow! Thank you so much! I messaged you the number of another Hemo Mom who is sure well versed in this. I hope it helps and you are able to get this resolved ASAP. Yes yes yes! I was a HTC social worker for many years. Recently had to leave because I had a newborn baby as well and no childcare with covid. Congrats!! I helped many families get hemlibra covered. Most insurance companies will cover once they are aware of the benefits. The price tag looks daunting but the longterm benefits outweigh it. Hemlibra = less factor.  We had some babies on Hemlibra only once a month at our center! I am VERY surprised the social worker would not help you. The first thing you need to do is get a case manager through your husbands insurance. Once they realize your son is a high dollar patient you would usually be assigned one. As a social worker, I would always help families with this. Start working with them and they can connect you with the right people. You can then have the HTC write a letter explaining the benefits of Hemlibra...highlighting that it will actually save them money. Remember these insurance companies dont know much about hemophilia, just that is its VERY expensive. Once educated they usually will approve. If not the doctor can do a peer to peer. Keep fighting, your social worker should be helping. I helped MANY families get approved. Let me know if you have any questions and good luck!! Our hematologist has been fighting with our insurance company for the past year. We plan to do the same for the time being in hopes that they change their minds before he needs it. That is a great idea about the case worker! I did not even realize we had access to that. Clearly I am new to all of this. Thank you so much for all of the suggestions! I will definitely be in touch! Just wanted to send a quick thank you... after your suggestions and recommendations we have likely found a way to have Hemlibra covered during my maternity leave. This group is amazing! Thanks all! Wonderful news!!! How?? If your insurance does not cover it you can apply to their charity organization. They will set you up very quickly. All you need is a prescription. \n\nFirst of all you need to contact the company Genentech. Each territory has its own nurse educator. They will refer you to their foundation and your baby should be covered. If not you should start with prophy on factor.\n\n Awesome to hear. We were in a similar situation with our newborn but was able to convince our insurance to cover it with the help of our HTC. He is been on it since 4 months (now 9 months) and have had no issues whatsoever. I am sorry I did not see this!

I would be careful with the aspirin, personally; my mom nearly bled out at both of her child births because of her VWD (although we did not know that caused until much later. ) Having some kind of a blood thinner in your system while you bleed a little more than usual may be less than ideal, even if it is low. Can you take Tylenol/acetaminophen instead?\n\nAlso, if you have taken a multi-year long break from aspirin, you might be in for a surprise kick if you take some. I borrowed one pill off a coworker 4 years after I got diagnosed due to an incoming migraine and I felt like I was high. So that was something. \n\nI am very sorry for your loss, btw. Hope you have got lots support for the hard time. What type of vwd do you have?  My parents have type I and their doctor lets them take it, but my brother and I have type iii and it would be huge mistake for us to take it. As a general rule aspirin is a no no for most bleeding disorders. Maybe you could ask why aspirin helps in miscarriage prevention and see if there is another alternative for someone with vonwilibrands? Also, I think when doctors recommend that, it is so people who might over clot dont as easily. So you might already have thin enough blood? And just because they suggest taking aspirin to say, prevent a heart attack, does not necessarily mean you will have a heart attack if you do not take it. Just my two cents. I really hope everything goes well. If you need real advise I know a hemophilia guru (my mom) , she would know. I would talk to your haematologist! They should be involved in conception/pregnancy really as they will have experience/colleagues who can best advise. \n\nUsually aspirin in for miscarriage prevention is advised for women who clot too much (anti phospholipid syndrome in particular). In agreement with BlueishBlackbird here, aspirin is generally a no go for any kind of blood disorder! Better to be safe than sorry especially if you have a little bun in the oven :) Yes, I was surprised my Ob, who specializes in high risk recommended this and I did stress I have VWD. She knows of my condition. She said aspirin helps with placenta processes. Thanks for your advice. That is a good idea. Thanks for your help. Thanks for your thoughtfulness and kind words. I have not taken aspirin for years myself and never knew that is can cause a euphoric reaction at all. So interesting! Yes, I will phone my hematologist. I will inform him of the Ob\u2019s advice and see what he thinks. Thanks so much! I believe my doc say type 1. But definitely not type 3. Thank you! I agree. I will phone my doctor. Thank you! Ultimately ask your doctor because type I can be extremely variable in severity.  Sorry to not give you a more definitive answer. Aspirin is a no no usually. But check with your Doctor to see what he says.", "Is it ok for me to do wrestling with hemophilia a severe? Hi im nearly 17 and am a junior at my highschool and am wondering if its ok for me to wrestle. Well i already have been wrestling sense freshmen year but just wana get your thoughts. Ty My school wanted a doctor's \"ok\", which I could never get (I also have Severe A). Once I turned 18, I decided to jump into BJJ.\n\nStretch, stretch, STRETCH. Do your factor religiously, know when to take it easy and rest. Ice your joints after your practices and matches. Seriously, do not be afraid to tell your coach you need to take it easy. If it becomes apparent that you need to stop, STOP. \n\nJust my opinion. Ty for your opinion. I also gota get a doctors OK. Worst that is happend is a shoulder joint problem last year but i am geting physical therapy and its much better I agree that its absolutely posible, in addition, make sure you muscle up, this actually helps prevent a lot of potential joint damage.\n\nThat being said, if you have the option and interest for another sport that is a little less contact focussed that might make things a little more comfortable.\n\nWhatever you choose, enjoy!! Stay on top of factor levels, aim to inject on days when you are going to wrestle. Warm up properly and stop when you get tired \n\n(And let your doc know!) I am 30 and severe A. I played a bunch of sports in middle school to highschool and stayed active throughout my life. My ankles cause me problems now because of basketball and tennis from back then. Medicine 10-15 years ago was more reactive than proactive. \nI was always good about not pushing through a practice or game if I felt something might be a bleed. I would say because of that I have not needed a fusion or replacement like a lot of hemophiliacs my age need.\nWith the new meds now having a 4 day half life and hemlibra hitting 1 month you can be a normal athlete as long as you do well maintaining factor levels like everyone is saying. Listen to your body if you feel something, stop. It sucks feeling like you could have pushed through it and finished because that is really rewarding. Future you will appreciate good joints more than pushing through one practice or losing a fight. Ty for your insight. I feel like im ok at knowing my limits. Cant say the same for my brother tho. He had a terrible knee injury around 12 and never fully recovered. Hes hemophelic and when he had that we were in the dominican republic were factor is almost none existent. Yes, do it. Just hidde that you have hemophilla and live with the consecuenses hehhe\nI do that... Lol The more active you can be without getting too hurt the better off you will be. Just know when to rest. And infuse at any indication of a problem. The stronger you can get the less bleeds you will have. So I think it is a good idea to wrestle. Just take care of yourself. I would strongly advise against it. High muscular and joint impacts can be dangerous and have major long term consequences. Head bleedings can be life threatening. I am 16 and have hemo a as well and I have played basketball my whole life. My right ankle is pretty bad rn and ive started to get bad bleeds in my hips one kd them causing me to lose feeling in my knee. I want to be able to at least finish out my highschool playing career but Is it worth it ? I have never met another hemophiliac whose played basketball so just wonder what your opinion is Even if you survive, your quality of life and job prospects will be severely impacted. I have mild hemophilia.  Wrestling was hard on my knees (still have some issues 20 years later) and I used factor for every practice.  I will say I love the sport and only wished I did not participate when my knees hurt while I exercise. Cat i get inhibiters if i do everyday? Or have u gotten them. I do every other day.

Hemophiliac type A severe here.\n\nI live in Latin-America and I am looking to find a job abroad in the near future in the IT field but I fear my disease will be a problem when trying to apply for job or a worker's visa. Does anybody know if it is hard to obtain resident status in Canada, Europe or Australia due to the medical costs that hemophilia carries? I have always had this question and never moved anywhere in my 20+ years of working. I do wonder about how it works under different scenarios, like a job related relocation, business opportunity like starting a new business and immigration across the globe. \n\nAnyone who has moved and their experiences, both good and bad? We are a bit of a fluke when it comes to medical costs. Even in Europe with bargaining and plenty of alternatives, the cost of our medication still comes to like $300k a year. As a result, most manufacturing companies will pay for your co-pays if you can afford some basic health insurance. It is a small cost to them for a big gain.\n\nAnd some even offer assistance with health insurance costs, or free product. Hemlibra in particular has been offering tons of assistance to get more patients since they are new to the scene, free product if you cannot afford insurance or even if you have insurance but it does not cover Hemlibra. You might have better luck posting a similar question on /r/IWantOut. Basically if you can get a job that will sponsor your visa &amp; healthcare costs - it is easier\u2026but either way it might be worth contacting your local h\u00e9mophilia society/the society where you want to move to and ask if they have any advice My SO immigrated to the EU from America with hemophilia, and not a single time has his health status come up in job interviews or anything, they are not **allowed** to ask those things.\n\nIn fact, I do not think he needed to mention it at ALL during his visa applications. Granted, he was moving on a spouse visa and not a work visa, but he did not have to give any of that info at all. The Swedish gov never asked.\n\nHowever, he DID need to make sure to bring copies of his medical files so he could get in touch with the hematologist. Most of his American care providers gave him a special document to give to the hospital here in the EU to fax BACK to them so that they could in turn fax over the files (HIPAA rules, or something like that, idk).\n\nHe was a temporary resident of Sweden and got full healthcare coverage here, no problem. He got factor issued to him (we paid a small amount out of pocket and the rest of the year was free for him) while still a temporary resident. He is now a permanent resident and his hemophilia has not affected his ability to live here whatsoever.\n\nALL OF THAT TO SAY, if you are applying for a work visa, the rules are likely different. You need to consult a sub that knows more about immigration rules.

I bleed 24-30 times a year and my joints are already in bad shape, very bad shape. I mostly take feiba although but only able to treat some 8-10 bleed in a year and the rest go untreated. Earlier I was able to just treat only 4-5 times a year only when I did not had a job. I know about hemlibra but it is way too costly even with patient support program being run in india. I am hardly able to afford feiba let alone hemlibra.\n\nSo I was searching the internet regarding new advancement being made in hemophilia as I always do and recently came to know about a gene therapy for people who have hemophilia a with inhibitors, SPK 8016.\n\nMy questions are \n\nWhether is it really for inhibitors patients or not? \n\nPeople who have already participated in spk 8016 gene therapy trial what are your current factor level, peak factor level, when you received your dose of spk 8016? How often do you bleed now or how often do you treat with factor or feiba or anything after your dose of spk 8016?\n\nHow it would work for inhibitors patient as I came to know that for phase 1 they only selected people who does not have inhibitors.\n\nHow can I participate in this trial as it is really frustrating, irritating and depressing to bleed almost 30 times a year and be in bed that too in my mid 20s? \n\nI would be very happy even though if I just move from severe to moderate if not mild.\n\nThanks in advance. It will work for patients with inhibitors. Our FDA recently made some decisions to hold off approval of another gene therapy because it can wane in efficacy over years. So it could be awhile before we see it available outside of clinical trials. unfortunately it will will cost more than any other therapy ever created so will remain out of reach for many:( Have you tried to contact a rep at the India Hemophilia Federation?  \n\nIt looks like they have some ongoing projects:  \n\nAlso, it says on \n\n&gt;ANTI HEMOPHELIC FACTOR (AHF) IS AVAILABLE FOR FREE IN FOLLOWING HOSPITALS.\n\nThere might be some treatment support through these centers. \n\nPlease keep us updated.. &gt;It will work for patients with inhibitors.\n\nWhat is this based on?  Has the trial reported any results? Gene Therapy makes your liver cells produce endogenous FVIII (your own). Inhibitors only recognize exogenous FVIII (infused not your own). Uniqure's AMT 180 will include patients with inhibitors. &gt;Uniqure's AMT 180 will include patients with inhibitors.\n\nSo does that mean it will work? \n\nOP, if you have further questions would be happy to DM:) thank you for replying, yes i know about factor or feiba being provided in htc in india. but the problem is way too many patient way too less injection available, also feiba is not available in every htc in india. availability of injection is not the matter or question here.\n\nThe thing is currently i am more interested in gene therapy hence all those question can you help me out with my queries above. u/Divrsdoitdepr  thank you for replying sir, yes i do have questions i asked 4 questions above in my post, only 1st has been answered the rest 3 are still not answered.\n\nhere are these:-\n\nPeople who have already participated in spk 8016 gene therapy trial what are your current factor level, peak factor level, when you received your dose of spk 8016?

I know this number is somewhat artificial because the meds are propping it up. I was told it would start decreasing rapidly. However after being off steroids for 3 weeks my level reach 264. This surprised everyone. \n\nAt this stage I started to really feel the after effects/withdrawal of the steroids and immune pills I would been taking daily for 12 weeks. I started feeling really tired and depressed. My whole body aches and joints felt like I would ran a marathon daily. Eventually I could slowly feel myself come back as my hormone levels began to balance and the steroids completely left my system.\n\nThis brings us to the start of January where I am starting to feel myself again. My factor levels are still in the 200+ range and despite my ongoing ankle issues I am feeling good. Then ... my ALT level took a big spike up to 168! So with no hesitation the doctors put me on a 3 day course of IV steroids as well as reinstating all the meds I was previously on but now at an even higher dose. \n\nThis means I am basically back to where I was in week 2 of the trial. Visiting the hospital twice a week and enduring all the side effects of the meds .sleepless nights, weight gain, shakes and more!\n\nMy alt has dropped to around 60 but I still need to stay on the meds and taper off gradually I am hoping next week I will be allowed to begin the 5 weeks taper and begin (again) to feel normal! \n\nCheerio till next time\u270c\ufe0f Are you allowed to share which clicnial trial you are participating in?  Ive heard of clinicians being hesitant to utilize GT bc of steroids and the side effects, The trial is \u201c GO-8: Gene therapy for haemophilia A using a novel serotype 8 capsid pseudotyped adeno-associated viral vector encoding Factor VIII-V3\nEudraCT no: 2016-00925-38;\u201d\n\nIt is been carried out by UCL in London Has anyone offered any theories as to what they think might be going on? Sorry to hear, hoping it all works out. \n\nI have been reading you updates from the beginning since I am 2 weeks into my factor 9 gene therapy.  I was actually asking my doctors about your protocol and the use of steroids.  The factor 9 trial does not use steroids unless LFT starts to rise which only seems to occur about 20% of patients.  The theory i was told is that due to the larger size of factor Viii it is much more likely to illicit an immune response as there is just more eptiopes for antibodies to bind.  Secondly which I did not know is that factor 9 and factor 8 are produced in different types.   With gene therapy factor 8 is now being produced in cells that normally would not express it.  Again this may more likely cause an immune response.  \n\nI am really hoping to avoid steroids if possible.  Right now I am patiently waiting for the biweekly blood results.  My long lasting factor is still to high to likely detect any changes yet. What causes the shakes? Wishing you good luck, my friend.\n\nI am having a blood test for antibodies to AAV next week to see if I can participate in a future study about gene therapy for hemophilia A with inhibitors in the U.S. The shakes are a direct side effect of the higher dose or prednisolone and Tacrolimus. It is pretty normal and stops when you stop taking them. They are actually more like internal tremors rather than than constant shaking. Do you mean with the factor level or ALT? Or side effects? Good luck to you too! Hope you get good results and can get on board. \n\nThe results and outcome have been amazing. The side effects of the meds and time commitment to the hospital check ups can be tough but in the grand scheme of things it is totally manageable. I mean the fact that you still seem to be having an immune response to the capsid after all the steroids and immune suppressants you have been on. The immune response seems varied across factor 8 patients and hard to predict.i seem to be one of the patients who is immune system was overly active despite level of immune suppression I was on.\n\nThose first few blood tests are pretty exciting. My factor was flat lining on the day of my infusion. Without a. Few days it was up to 9% I have not injected myself since the 21st of September! \n\nKeeps us posted how you are getting on. Thanks for encouragement.  My trial protocol include a dose of factor the day of the infusion. In my case the dose was double my normal prophy. Plus it was king lasting factor which means I am still about 20% more than two weeks later. I am hoping I will start to be able to see some results next week.\nIn someways I cannot believe it has only been two weeks.  With all the follow-ups it feels like months. Seeing some positive results is something I am eagerly waiting for. \n\nAgain thanks for your posts.  I enjoyed reading them. That sucks. So sorry to hear. This is what we guinea pigs sign up for SCIENCE!  \nTwo weeks away from my IX gene moonshot. Your testimony was a much-needed reality check. Godspeed my friend.

On the plus side I have hit the highest level of clotting factor at 260+.

I have also been told that celery and parsley would cause the same effect. Any idea to why this happens?  Pineapples do have bromelain which can increase the chances of bleeding. Same with garlic, ginger and a few other things. Almonds appear to have natural blood-thinning properties as well. Some women use them to relieve menstrual cramps, but the trade-off is an extra day of bleeding. I have also seen people use them for hangovers. Supposedly, ten almonds are around the equivalent of one aspirin tablet.  That is interesting. Especially because I love almond milk. I am going to have to run some experiments with this one.

Does anyone have a resource they jnow of where I could donate some leftover Advate I have? Just switched to Hemlibra which has been lit so far. Keeping a few bleed doses on hand but still have a few weeks supply of advate that Id hate to go to waste. Shoot an email to WFH, or some local charities. Do not let those go to waste. In some places around the world these medicines are considered Elixir of life. :) I would keep it on hand if I were you. Hemlibra only raises your level to the equivalent of 40% at best. That is still mild hemophilia. You will likely find that you will still have the occasional bleed. Certainly if you happen to get injured you will still need to infuse. I have been on Hemlibra just over a year and I fell off a ladder, twisted my ankle, and crashed on my dirt bike, just to name a few. Since starting Hemlibra I have also been being more active and have needed to infuse a few times for regular bleeds from overdoing it. I would get sore and the soreness would not get bad like a bleed used to, but it would just hang on and gradually get worse over the coarse of a week, until I infused just one time, then I would feel better the next day. I am all for donating factor you do not need, but I would wait a while to make sure. Hemlibra is a great product but I really think people will eventually see that it does not make factor obsolete. Congrats on getting on Hemlibra though. Things sure are a lot better now. Take care. Hemilibra gets you to 40%!?!?? Wow I did not realize that! That really great It does not really work that way. But the highest equivalent is said to be something like 40%, as I understand it. I could be wrong too. My point is that if I did not have factor since I have been on Hemlibra this year I would be screwed. Hemlibra helps a ton but it is not a factor replacement in my experience. My doctors told me to keep 3 treatments worth just incase. Have not needed it since I started in December 2019. That makes sense! Thanks for the info Highly recommend Save One Life (( which sends factor to developing countries. I personally donated Advate to them after switching to Hemlibra.\n\nAs others have said, definitely wait some time to be sure you are going to stay on Hemlibra, and you should still have a few doses on hand in case bleeds do occur. Note that factor donations cannot be expired. And they do not usually take supplies like syringes and needles, and recommend donating those to a local veterinarian instead.

Although, I think currently Hamilton and Vancouver are the only two places currently doing studies, at least for Hemophilia B. I believe McMaster is also starting a Hemophilia A gene therapy study but I am not sure about Vancouver. \n\nAfter having just gone through this I can say these studies require Alot of coordination between different hospital departments.  The logistics are challenging given the safety precautions needed because of the live virus used. If you cannot find something in your city and you are willing to travel, clinical trials usually reimburse for travel, food and lodging. ", "BAY 94\u20109027, a PEGylated recombinant factor VIII, exhibits a prolonged half\u2010life and higher area under the curve in patients with severe haemophilia A  ", "Anyone had heart surgery? So I have a ruptured p2 chord and have severe mitral valve regurgitation and am going to have to have surgery soon. Has anyone else had heart surgery? Where did you go?\nI have talked to 5 cardiac centers and only one has worked with hemophiliac patients. But they want to do open heart surgery, which is scary.  Holy shit dude! That is intense. I do not have any knowledge or advice, just want to offer my support. All the surgeries I have had have gone really well, I just infused right before the procedure. I think sometimes they can also give you a continuous iv drip of factor during surgery. My dm\u2019s are always open if you need to vent or process. Best of luck on this journey and I hope you have a speedy recovery. I wish you the very best and a speedy recovery!! You will come out on top of this, I am sure of it. I agree with the other comment, get infused before the surgery and ask if a drip could be used during the surgery. If you can, try to have one of your surgical doctors contact a hemophilia center to ask for advice and tips for appropriate Factor dosage and after care post-surgery. You will do great! Take care, and let us know how it goes!*Eye of the tiger starts playing in the background* (\n\n( So to break it down.\n\nMy initial heart place has a surgeon who seemed confident that he could do the surgery robotically. But did not really make mention of the hemophilia aspect.\nThe two top heart surgery centers in the country are Cleveland Clinic and Mount Sinai in New York.\n\nSo we reached out to them as well as Emory in Atlanta because they are the closest valve center. I live in Nashville and go to Vanderbilt for my hemophilia so we talked to them as well.\n\nEmory seemed like a good fit. The surgeon wanted to do it robotically and seemed very capable, but had never worked with hemophilia.\nVanderbilt has worked with hemophiliacs, but did not seem to have a solid plan for the surgery.\nCleveland clinic refused to do the surgery and recommended a mitral clip instead. A mitral clip does not 100% solve the problem and is usually used with geriatrics. I am 43. So that guy is basically only taking the easy cases so his numbers look good.\nNew York seems to have a decent hematologist and they have the top surgeon in the country. He is going to do the surgery personally, so I think that is where I will end up.\nHe wants to do a sternotomy instead of robotics because it is easier to make sure that I do not have a bleed before they close me up. Thanks for these. My girlfriend is a doctor, so I passed them along. My heart goes out to you! I have not had heart surgery but am contemplating it. I have had several episodes of AFIB and might try for an ablation if I keep having them while on meds for it. \n\nI do not have any advice, it seems like you have got what to do more than covered. \n\nWishing you the best and a speedy recovery! Bro.. they will pump you with factor. It will go just as if you do not have Hemophilia. Do not worry. You will be fine. Only way I would have surgery would be on an interveinous drip before, during and after. I have had 3 joint replacements that way never had any problems It must be nice to have a doc in the family!\n\nWhat is your Hemophilia Dx and current treatment regimen? Well I am only hemophilia A 18% mild, but in this case it is worse to be mild because it is harder to keep the levels where you need them. The hemotologist is talking about having me at 200 or 300% clotting during the surgery and the next couple of days afterwards, so that is weird. None of the centers that we talked are doing continuous drip. New York has done it, but say that it is harder to coordinate and does not give any more benefit than the other way. Yeah, the hematologist in New York said he could make it so they could not tell i had it. That is interesting.  How often have you received FVIII replacement?  Do you know whether you have received plasma-derived or recombinant products?  If you have rarely been treated I am wondering if the development of an inhibitor is a concern that is been considered. I have only had recombinant as far as I know. I have had a couple of bad bleeds in my knees and then I had my wisdom teeth removed. This must be so stressful for you.  Hang in there.\n\nMy only comment is related to surgeries in general.  Make sure you know the treatment plan that you hematologist has developed.  When and how much factor you will be receiving. Share this info with your g/f ( helps she is a doctor), especially if you will incapacitated after the surgery.  I have found that factor infusions can sometimes get overlooked once you are on the ward. It is something that is not common so is easy to miss.. I have learned you need to be a strong advocate, or have a strong advocate and take an active role in your treatment.\n\nWish you the best, keep us updated. Thanks! Yeah, I had my first hospital visit in 2017 because of my heart going into AFIB with RVR and I kept having to tell them that I was a hemophiliac. They kept wanting to put me on blood thinners and I am like, it is ok, I brought my own. &gt; The hemotologist is talking about having me at 200 or 300% clotting during the surgery and the next couple of days afterwards, so that is weird.\n\nSo this seems related: I am now mild B due to a gene therapy clinical trial.  The last time I saw the trial hematologist we had a brief discussion about the need for me to be seen by my own hematologist on a regular basis, since I am currently without one.  I figured if I was ever in a situation where I needed surgery, I would just tell them to get me up to 100% from my current ~35-45%.  Her concern was that in some surgical situations, for example knee replacement, the best practice it to proactively treat with aspirin or blood thinners to avoid excessive clotting and that those measures should still be taken in my case.  She thinks there may be tendency to avoid those measures due to hemophilia.\n\nLooking at the papers I linked you to, it seems like anticoagulants are part of the post-op practice for cardiac surgery. Your comment about 200-300% and your comment below about blood thinners makes me think that this topic may deserve special attention. The hematologist said that a normal person going into surgery would be spiking at 200 to 300%, so that is what they mimic here too. I have not heard that before.  Is that due to stress? I suppose stress mixed with the body's natural responses. That is too funny. They need to coordinate with a hemotologist that works with hemophiliacs.", "New gene therapy uses Tylenol to combat genetic diseases ", "Want another kid but worried about having a son with severe hemophilia? Is it really bad having severe hemophilia these days?  I believe 20 years ago severe hemophiliacs would not make it past early teen years. Fwiw I am a female with mild hemophilia (my factor levels are around 20).\n\nI have a daughter, not sure if she is a hemophilia since we have not tested her yet. I would like to chime in with my perspective on the topic. I was born with severe hemophilia A and I would say my life has been largely unaffected due to the disorder. Hemophilia has never hindered me playing tennis, traveling the world, getting a career, finding love, or any other normal part of life. The majority of my friends know I have it, but generally forget since it is such a minor part of my identity. For reference, I live in the United States and have been on prophylaxis my entire life.\n\nI also believe your potential son would be mild and not severe. This is less about current lifestyle and more about the birth roulette...\n\nMy grandfather and his brother were both severe and lived into their 80s. My mother is carrier and has some VWD which she developed later in life. My father is non-hemo.  My brother is mild, I am non-hemo. We had one miscarried prior sibling who was evidently too severe to bring to term.\n\nEdit: clarity I would also like to share my perspective as a severe hemophilia type A male in his late 20s. It is a minor part of my identity and aside from the annual checkups with a hematology team(I live in Northern California and go to Stanford, not sure if this type of appointment is required for others) I say my life has been pretty \u201cnormal\u201d. Sure there were things I could not do during school like contact sports but I never felt like I was denied any experiences. I am also on a prophylaxis plan where I take factor medication every other day and that is been very manageable. I have never had an issue carrying my medication on business trips or leisure traveling. I have even brought my medication to the middle of the desert for burning man, multiple times. \n\nCurrently there are also a lot of treatment plans available. Hemlibra, from my understanding, can make it so that I only need to infuse once a month. There are also trials for a liver protein that would essentially \u201ccure\u201d the hemophilia. I am personally waiting to be part of that test trial in Northern California. Let me give my two cents and I will not mince my words, I am the eldest son and I have a younger brother who is one year younger(non-hemophilaic), I was born in India at a time when the disease itself was not known and the treatment was hardly available, factor concentrates were a luxury which only the rich were  able to afford, other than the general precautions like avoiding injuries and RICE techniques.\n\nAfter my injuries came into light, my parents seriously considered over having a second child, because they were told there is a 50% chance he may have the same problem as me, if they were not confused enough when they were introduced to haemophillia, now they had the doubt if the other son/daughter would suffer the same fate, finding out the gender of the foetus is illegal in India, so the only way to be certain is when the baby is born, but they still went ahead BECAUSE I would have someone with me to depend on in their absence, and boy were they a visionary, not only because of God's blessing, he was born healthy and without any underlying ailment, but growing up I can countless instances where he assisted me in times of injuries and provide not only moral support, but criticism too. Growing up with someone is always helpful, because as we all have experienced while growing up with this condition that when going through a difficult recovery a hand on your shoulder and words of encouragement can di wonders, \n\nAt the end of the day, it is your choice to whether have a second child or not, I am 28 and I am unmarried, I will not understand the complications of raising a second child, but what I have experienced growing up, did make difficult times easy to paas by, and in this day and age, when treatment is readily available. A second sibling will always look out for the other, in times of trouble, and help them fend of any danger, and when they will both attain a certain age, they will have a rapport like best pals, for me my brother has been a blessing, and I am sure if you go for a second son/daughter they will play a vital part in your son's safe upbringing Your second children would most likely be a mild or healthy, as far as I know there is no way for you to give birth to a severe hemophiliac, but still, if you are worried about that you can always go to genetic counseling My mom gave birth to my sister and I in the mid-90s and has Von Willebrand Disorder.\n\nShe almost bled out when she had me, and required about 8 infusions as it was. When my sister came along, mom almost bled out AGAIN, requiring more infusions and was strictly told to not have anymore kids after that due to the risk. \n\nShe had a hysterectomy a year and a half later.\n\nGet your daughter tested sooner than later. My sister and I were tested in our teens, and diagnosed at the same time. This is an important perspective. And it is from someone who does not have the advantage of receiving proper medical care. I think if you live somewhere with adequate treatment possibilities you will find that although it can be a challenge, it is one with many rewards. I am severe A, 45, and grew up in rural alaska. I have always had access to factor but also lived a pretty active life. I am doing very well physically. I have had some tough times dealing with bleeds and injuries, but those things only make you tougher and allow you to gain insight. I would not trade my life with someone without my experiences because I have become who I am because of that. I feel strongly that in today\u2019s world having a child with the possibility of being hemophiliac is no reason to abstain. Unless you know for sure that there is not access to proper health care in your area. Get your daughter tested. Do not wait for an unrelated medical emergency to find out, because certain situations require this prior knowledge.\n\nYou should go for genetic counseling and take an informed decision about this. \n\nMy personal views is that all kids need to have a sibling. So I would recommend that you have another child, but that is just me, being me. And what is your age? Dont be selfish, think about the child first I (F28) also have mild Hemophilia and have the same concerns that you do.\n\nThe severity of the Hemophilia is hereditary so if your dad is mild and you had a son with Hemophilia, his would be mild too.\n\nHave you considered preimplantation genetic testing? Obviously I do not know your financial situation or the availability of this in your country but could be worth exploring.\n\nI know my parents battled with the decision of having kids as they knew if they had a daughter, she would be a carrier. They worried about burdening me with the decision you and I are facing now. \n\nFrom what I have learned more recently, the life of a haemophiliac is very different to what we would have seen growing up with the prevention and treatment of bleeds being much more manageable. \n\nI hope you find the answers you are looking for and are ultimately happy in whatever decision you make. Know that you are not alone and there are others who can share your thoughts and fears.\n\nGood luck :) Born in 1994 Are you saying that you are not switching to Hemlibra because you are waiting to be in a gene therapy clinical trial?  Why?

It could always be worse, and I am lucky enough to have friends and family that care about me and support me. I have learned that embracing it was the best thing I have ever done.

It doesnt help when your mother talks/ brags about having to deal with it.  separate yourself from your mother in basic life.   You need to get away from her, especially in social engagements.

She is your mom... so always treat her with respect, but she has no right to throw you under the bus.  If she is going to do that, separate in all situations where you know she might make you feel uncomfortable.   This will allow for a better relationship between the two of you down the road.

Well she was right haha! Much older now, cannot jog, run and I can barely walk couple hundred yards without being in agony. Only option now is to fuse both my ankles but, they only do 1 at a time and it takes a year to recover and walk on that one ankle again sooo that is not really an option until I am a millionaire and do not have to work!

Do you lift heavy? I tried fitness but was afraid that it may damage my joints even more. I always take 4000 units before any sports or fitness. Never really have bleedings like that. So damage is definitely coming from micro bleedings for me.

I was diagnosed by a doctor with a form of arthritis in my right ankle (They only did an MRI scan on my right one for whatever reason) when I was 11. The hospital I go to decided to employ a Haemophiliac nurse not long after and every time I have mentioned it since then the nurse has told me that I do not have any arthritis in my ankle. I have been ignoring it but since lurking on this subreddit and seeing how many other people have arthritis I thought about requesting to look at my notes to see If there is any documentation regarding the diagnosis, before bringing it up again. Has anyone else has a similar situation and/or what would you do?\n\n3. I have seen posts about pain and how to ease it but does everyone get these aches and pains? Particularly in their joints? Ankles, knees, etc.. Again every time I have mentioned having an ache or pain I have been told I should not be if I am taking my prophylaxis regularly. I was also told that I should not have a pains with my joints from driving.\n\n4. Does anyone know how to switch hospitals in the UK? Or would you recommend it? I would rather go to a hospital more geared towards Haemophilia, than my local one.\n\n5. I am interested in learning a martial art.

I always tell her to find a spot that does not have scars or bruises and I will think about it.  I am marked up enough without outside help.  On a serious note, take care of yourself. Our bodies are not made to last. &gt; If you do not look like you are either in an abusive relationship or into S&amp;M, you are factor levels are too high.\n\nHuh? That is how that works. I do not have any scars, bruising, etc. and my factor levels are at a great spot. I guess the only scars I have are from my infusions I used to get weekly before switching to Hemlibra.\n\nBut just because I make sure to be careful and continue to keep my factor levels at a safe level, does not mean they are too high. OK..  Not sure how I managed to not hear about Hemlibra, but wow... No more prophy or treat on demand???   We are in the future!\n\nSo... I have just poured over some information about this.   Fanscinating that it bridges the gap between IX and X factors to ignore the missing 8 in the clotting cascade!\n\nBut... the question I have, is how do they measure the efficacy?  Obviously the factor 8 levels will still be zero - so... do you know anything about this?\n\nI am about to call my hematologist right now to request if this is a good decision.   I know I did hear about something like this a few years ago in europe, and how there were some fatalities, but hopefully all the kinks are worked out. I never get bruises or anything like that...    I know girls can bruise a little bit easier, but since my factor 8 lvl is usually zero, bruising is not something that really happens much.\n\nAre you on prophy? &gt; how do they measure the efficacy?\n\nNot really sure. I do not fully understand the science aspect behind it. Not much into the biological nature. More of a software/programming person. Lol.\n\nBut what I do know is that I actually have not had any blood work or anything done. I have been on it for 2 months now. The first month I did my loading doses (double dose) and it put me up to my current levels. I started with 270 mg doses for the first 4 weeks and am not on 132 mg per week. The Factor IX/X levels stay higher up and goes around Factor VIII.\n\nSo far it has been fairly successful. I have had one (maybe) breakout bleed, although when I talked to my Hematologist about said breakout bleed, they think it might have actually been arthritis causing swelling in my left elbow. It is been a pretty nasty target bleed location and even gave me problems when I was on weekly Eloctate from time to time. But as of right now it is unknown as to what is happening. If it happens again I am going to begin taking action to get it looked at and see what else we can do about it. It is the primary reason I switched to prophy but my veins are so scarred that the day Hemlibra got FDA approval in September, we immediately began the setup to switch rather than getting a port. Took a few weeks for insurance to approve it.\n\nBut the subcue shots are a million times easier than having to go to an infusion center and get a treatment.\n\nAs far as fatalities go, I think they were all unlinked to Hemlibra. However, it is a risk as it is a newer medication and has only been around in inhibitor patients for a year or 2 and in non-inhibitor patients for 2 months. I have been willing to risk it for a better quality of life so we shall see how things go in the long run!\n\nFor the first 4 weeks I did get a small rash at the injection site, slight dizziness and my target joints that I have had bleeds in (and my left hip where I had a Hematoma twice) got a bit sore the first two doses. But those have all disappeared and I think the dizziness was just because my blood pressure rose as I was nervous from poking myself; something I have never done before since I would never be able to hit my own veins. When I was a kid, I used to count my bruises in the bath. 32 was my record, from pea sized on up to saucer sized. Also, when I was a kid my parents did not put me in shorts in public because they were getting yelled at about being reported to Child's Services (twice) or getting glares. I just got the bruises from playing hard (and hemophilia of course). I forget my sense of humor does not translate well on here.  I was having a little fun at \"our\" expense.  I am sure you and all of the other guys manage their factor levels just fine. Happy New Year.  Lol. Well I do not think I have seen anyone use humor here before, so I just assumed you were serious. Haha.\n\nHappy New Year. This may answer some of your questions: ( Do you feel the target joints were absolutely linked to the hemlibra?  Or could they have been the normal style bleeds and the hemlibra had not really activated yet?\n\nI am not a fan of giving myself shots, but after 20 years, I am pretty numb to it...   I only do as needed, and use a good vein on my hands, but if I have to treat for over 10 doses or so, it gets rough.  I have to switch to other places, which I am not a fan of, because in the hand is so easy.\n\nI am trying to think of how they would perform the efficacy of it.   I wonder if a standard clotting time method would work.  There are the old timey coagulation machines, where they poked a slice in your forearm and then used a spinning paper disk to collect the blood, or something.  Could not find any info on google, however.\n\nI do dabble a bit in the sciences, and no bloodwork scares me a bit.\n\nWhat country are you in?  America, right? &gt; Do you feel the target joints were absolutely linked to the hemlibra? Or could they have been the normal style bleeds and the hemlibra had not really activated yet?\n\nI am not really sure. It is a common side effect so there is a good chance that this was the reasoning for the aching, but on the other hand I do get some joint ache before a big storm and we had a winter storm hit the following day. So as to which it was, I will probably never know. But it only happened the first week and that is a common side effect from this medication, so. To answer the question directly, no I do not know for sure if it was linked. The Hemlibra takes upwards of a week to fully take shape (I took my last dose of Eloctate the week of the treatment 2 days after my first dose) and a month to get to full levels.\n\n&gt; I am not a fan of giving myself shots, but after 20 years\n\nYeah, I would never be able to do an IV. But this is a 26 gauge needle. Extremely small, hurts a little bit the first few times but nothing in comparison to getting an IV once per week or even occasionally so I will take it. You can really only feel the needle in your tissue. I would not go as far to say it actually hurts, as much as it is just an abnormal location to feel something like that to me. Pushing the meds in is a similar feeling. At first you feel it and you think it hurts, but then you realize it is just something new being put there.\n\nI am not sure as to the science behind it. They did extensive testing though and it passed FDA approval and it does not have an adverse effects with my non-Hemophilia medications, so that is all I needed to hear for now. So far it is been worth the risk. My nurse at the Hematology Clinic who set me up with it contacted me 3 times in the first week I took it, once per week with the loading doses and 2 or 3 times a month since then. It is still new so who knows what will happen in the long run, however if you do have a bleed on it, you are ordered to take a Factor VIII dose. Since the Factors are separate it is not really that dangerous like you would think. No over clotting, but there is always a risk of various clots and the obvious dangers behind those as all Hemophilia medications.\n\nDependent on your bleeding issues, you may only need to take a dose once per month or twice per month. For me we do once per week due to my elbow issue.\n\nAnd yeah, I live in America. Michigan specifically. Very cool.   Thank you for the detailed response.   I give myself IV's with... I think 26 gauge.   When I was doing the interferon thing for HepC, these little tiny needles (insulin?) sized were used.  Could not feel it in the slightest bit.   2 hours after, I felt like I had the flu, but I am going OT.\n\nI am really looking forward to what this could mean to me.  Since I hate prophy, this could change my life, although it would have been a lot nicer to have around 30 years ago, but I will take it!  \n\nThe science behind it is fascinating.  So, there is 23? clotting factors, and one depends on the one before it (or something).   So... when you get cut, factor 1 goes to work.  That allows factor 2 to do its thing, and so forth.  For us, we get to factor 8, and factor 9 cannot do it is thing because there is no factor 8 to work with.   What hemlibra does (if I understand correctly) is it is an antibody? and bridges a gap between factors 9 and 10, so that the clotting cascade continues, without factor 8.  But I will stop there before I become a perpetrator of fake news :) Yeah, it is a 26 gauge. I think most butterfly needles are like 24-26. But this one is only 3/8th inch long so it is extremely short. Plus with it being put into your fatty tissue, barely hurts at all. More like a pinch if anything. It is a lot smaller than I am used to though as the Infusion Center uses 22 gauge on me due to my vein scarring. \n\nAlso, I am not sure if that is how it works but it does make sense! I probably should learn a bit more about the science behind my own disorder. Lol.\n\nWell, if you can start it good luck! Hope it works out for you and makes everything better! I am thank you, honestly by now the bruises normally do not hurt enough to affect anything  I wish my bruising was not so bad, but I am very fair skinned so I think it just makes them look extra dramatic sometimes. I actually have hemophilia C so I am not on medication but I do have to do FFP. ", "I have taken 864,120 units of Recombinate since the end of 2013... On demand. I have been compiling my treatment records into an excel spreadsheet since the end of November 2013... which makes it easy to search and tally data, and today I got curious while adding today\u2019s dose... here is some data from my life with Hemophilia over the past several years.

Why are you still on on-demand treatment? Get on prophylaxis man. Before it is too late. You are wrecking your body with every bleed. I have about 1 bleed a year if that since on prophylaxis I actually live a mostly reclusive and sedentary life. Most of the recent years treatments are actually preventative and not for bleeds.  I learned that lesson a few years back when i found out I have ankle damage... also planning on switching to HemLibra in the very near future here. So about 250 bleeds in 7 years? That is more than 1 bleed a month. You should definitely be on prophylaxis to save what is left of healthy in your joints. Each treatment is not a single bleed. Several of them were multiple day treatments for one bleed.   Examples like 8 days of treatment for a kidney bleed slew the results a bit. Most of my joints are thankfully pretty good with the exception of my right ankle. Which I have been more proactive about for the last few years since I learned about the joint damage, and I have stayed off of it to let heal as much as I can. I also treat a lot more preventatively than I used to.  It is definitely healed in the past 3 years, I would have to check my logs to actually know the last time I had a bleed in the bad ankle, which is kind of amazing.  Switching to HemLibra this year, that should help things a lot from what I have heard. I stayed on-demand for too long also.  I can say that prophy and an increase in dosage by a new doc improved my quality of life tremendously.  I might switch to Hemlibra this year or next, but whichever rproduct you take, preventative treatment is worth it.  Good luck, whatever you decide. On demand does not seem to work for most people. At our gatherings, the old timers who were on it basically all hobble around with or without walking aids. I was on the way to join them until my doctor finally started prophylaxis at an effective dosage. Severe A here. You sound nearly identical to me. I rocked on demand for 30+ years. I lost both my knees, so I have replacements. And my right elbow cannot extend fully anymore. I would try taking meds twice a week for a month, then get stubborn and deal with it. I let things get too far though. My pain tolerance is so high, I just shrug things off. Anything less than a bone sticking out, I simply walk it off. I do end up paying for it later. My knees were the big issues. I dealt with those for a decade before I lost all mobility. From 12 to 23 I walked with a cane. :(", "Ankle replacement Have any of you had your ankle replaced in the last few years with the new technology that is out there? If, so how is it and did it bring any downsides or was it a good solution?\n\nThe reason I ask is that my right ankle has had several surgeries already and has never been right. Recently I discovered it has two giant bone spurs which essentially fused my tibia and the adjoining bone from any forward motion. So my current options are get a brace(this I will not think will do much as I already have a brace that I have been wearing), injections to dull the pain, go in and remove the bone spurs and make the best out of what I have already, or the full replacement. \n\nI have gotten used to the pain and it is been this way for a number of years, so I am not in a rush to do anything and would rather make a well informed decision before I go under the knife. So basically I am looking for any friendly advice any of you may have to offer? \n\nFor context I am Mild Hemophilia A and my ankle problems started with a bone cystic legion at age 13 and I am currently 32. \n\nThanks!", "Thanks for encouraging me to find a real hematologist Back in October I had a uterine ablation because my hematologists never took my bleeding very seriously but my OB, after witnessing a few episodes, was really concerned.  I posted here to see if anyone else has experience and you all suggested finding a better hematologist.\n\nWell, in February my youngest daughter needed a hematologist and I took her to our nearest big city, to their teaching hospital.  And the hematology team there was appalled that I did not have a Tx plan beyond \"go to the ER\" so they got me in, too.  I literally cried when the doctor told me how serious my bleeding history was and how I really should have been managed better.  \n\nAfter 30 years of hematologists dismissing my bleeds (and I have nearly died three times) because I do not meet any specific diagnostic criteria, I finally have a team that takes them seriously!!!  I have a treatment plan and people to call.\n\nWhich is extra fabulous because I need surgery next week and I am not terrified of bleeding to death because for once I actually trust my hematologists!\n\nI do not know that I will ever have a diagnosis, but I am determined that my daughter never has to fight so hard for Tx. I am really glad you were able to find someone better for you and your daughter. My sister had a very similar experience to you unfortunately, even when she mentioned I have hemophilia and even when her levels were below normal, she was not taken seriously. Wow! Glad you found a team to help you and do surgery. And they are there for your daughter. Sweet! Good luck with everything and please\n Update us! Nice to hear the occasilnal good news. Glad to hear a fellow bleeder is doing better. What country are you located in, if I may ask? This is great news and am happy for you! If at all possible, you may want to leave a review of the old hematologist if you are comfortable in doing so. You might just save someone else their own troubles or perhaps even their life. Best of luck with your new hematologist, cheers! I am in the USA.  I have mild hemophilia C and a family history of VWD, but my levels typically come back just below normal or at the low end of the normal range.  So all the hematologists have been dismissive, except one at the Children's Hospital when I was very young who told my mom that I would probably never get a diagnosis but that did not mean not to take it seriously.  \n\nI think it is likely something platelet related, but the testing is outrageously expensive and again most hematologists have been dismissive.  My current team suggested platelets and I nearly screamed, \"Right???\"  I would have it done now pre-op but with Covid no one is doing it. Thanks! Ugh, so frustrating!!  I have had several ER trips where doctors literally did not know what to do because there was so much blood...  And then hematologists say, \"oh but you got it stopped, it is fine, just do that again.\" Because multiple cauterizations and bags of FFP and days in a hospital are totally normal \ud83d\ude44 Thanks!  I have cycled through about half a dozen because after a few visits of them not taking it seriously, what is the point?  Unfortunately I hear my experience is typical for a woman with abnormal bleeding. If you are close to the 4 major hubs, Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, there is a major hemophilia center in each and all are so excellent and more than willing to help with anything. I did not know I have Type A until I was 18 and they did en entire study on me for nothing. \n\nSo happy to hear everything worked out! This sounds like you have been completely mismanaged and bungled and I am sorry you were just sorta ignored like that.  The evaluation should be pretty straight forward and any semi competent medical doctor let alone a hematologist should be to figure out what the issue is.  Check platelets, PT/INR, PTT, bleed time for starters  bleeding is caused by some defect in one of those categories.....  Then you check von will brand factor, specific factors, fibrinogen, some of the hyper coagulable proteins....etc..   Sad to hear this 'doctor' is that dumb or does not care and you had to deal with it. How was your surgery? It all went really well, thanks!  No uncontrolled bleeding!!!!", "Anxiety with Infusion due to bad veins As above. I have very bad veins. Veins that run. Veins that are not clear, veins that do not rise up despite having a tight tourniquet on. I have great anxiety whenever I have to infuse. I have been getting infusions all my life but I still have anxiety. How do you all get past this when trying to infuse yourself?  \n\n\nSometimes my bleeds are so bad and I am in such great pain, and yet I have to overcome and get the damn needle in and it is so freaking hard. Sometimes I need to go to a doctor's to get it done. But I get bleeds in the middle of the night often so there is no clinic open and I am so tired and I do not know how to infuse when i am in pain, so tired and my veins are not behaving. =(", "Is Inhibitor level reduce after some time Hi friends, If my body develops Inhibitor to factor eight. Does this Inhibitor level is permanent through entire life or this level will reduce after time?  It is permanent. They just move you onto a new product  Inhibitor levels can change over time and can even be reduced, I believe. This is a conversation you need to have with your doctors! (\n\n(\n\n Depending on the titer, they can even go away, at least for a while.  Titers under 2 are frequently transient, esp in kids.  Higher titers are ususally permanent, but can also vary in amount year to year, especially if you have not seen any factor 8 for a while. Inhibitors can go away. But it takes work. I had Inhibitors for 24 years. I started Immune Tolerance Therapy (ITT) / Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) with a plasma derived factor called Koate by Kedrion.

I got tested 13-15 years ago and the level ranged from 30%-35%. \n\nThen I was tested again last year and got 48%, which puts me almost in the normal range. \n\nWeirdly, I still get bleeds now and then and have phases when I am covered in bruises. \n\nAnyone have up to date resources for women and factor VIII that I can access? No point discussing it with my son's HTC. They will not acknowledge females have anything but inconcenient moments. \ud83d\ude21 Factor levels do fluctuate depending on many things. Also, labs often make mistakes. Listen to your body. If you have bleeds, you know. 48% is still pretty low too. I do not know of any resources off hand besides that hemaware magazine (I think it is called). But most treatment centers have changed their thinking and define women with low levels as having hemophilia. My daughter is a carrier with around 40% and she needs to infuse a couple times a year. She is considering just infusing every month because her periods are so heavy and she is sick of it. We finally infused her this time (a few days ago) for her period and because she stubbed her toe, and she said her period was way less heavy. I have spent years trying to talk to the HTC about it. I keep getting brushed under the carpet. But I am glad yours is assisting your daughter. Means our struggles are not wasted! \n\nThanks heaps for alerting me to Hemaware magazine. I will investigate it. Sorry to hear this. My mother was a mild hemophiliac and had bad experiences when she got her tonsels removed as a child.  She required blood transfusions after an issue with an IUD. I really thought that HTC should recognize this by now.  This is not just an issue with the odd bleed or bruising but could be serious if you were to ever require surgery or other medical interventions. \n\nAs the other poster mentioned factor levels can fluctuate alot, things like your period can affect it.  Heavy periods in women can also lead to iron deciency. There were some other posts recently asking about the relationship of Viii and VWD. Honestly, I am not a medical doctor but you likely need more testing done. \n\nI would I encourage you to contact your local chapter of the Hemophilia society or even the national chapter.  They might have some resources or doctors who are more knowledgeable to can refer you to. Maybe you need to travel to another HTC for your own care. The one thing I learned as a hemophiliac: you have to be your own advocate and have to be the squeaky wheel. Also learned to always be nice to nurses when in the hospital.\n\nGood luck. I actually also have something similar happen to me. When I was originally getting diagnosed, my factor was at around 32%, and I got my diagnosis. Eventually after a few months they transfered me to a different doctor for further treatment who ran a few test again and undiagnosed me because my levels where around 45-50 range. The issue with me is that I was also originally diagnosed with Von Willebrands and Thrombocytopenia, so my brusing and bleeding is also very much likely from that and I have not gotten my factor retested since then. Since my treatment works for all three I have not really paid mind to it.\n\nWhat I recommend, find a doctor who focuses on women with hemophilia. Sometimes doctors focus on how men present rather than women, finding someone who can focus on our normal might help.

I just switched my son ( 2y 10 months, Hem A, Severe, No inhib) to Hemlibra, we just finished the first month weekly dose phase, and this week we just administered his first bi weekly dose. \n\nAll doses have been administered in the arms, and 2-3 days after the dosing he is been scratching the zone a lot. I know it is part of the side effects but wanted to ask you what is the itching feeling like and how can I help him reduce the feeling. Since his age he does not say much and generally never complains of pain or anything. \n\nI just want to understand better what he is feeling, to help him overcome it.\n\nThank you all!! I have never felt any itching from Hemlibra. I use the belly skin/fat. Maybe try that. It sounds to me like he maybe interested in the spot that the shot happens, more than it actually itching, maybe? Do you put a bandaid on it? If not, try that. If you do, try not using a bandaid? I have t heard of anyone itching at the site. I cannot even feel anything from Hemlibra going in. Good luck. I have not made the switch yet but I have asked questions for two years.  I have been told, on multiple occasions by different people involved with Hemlibra that if you experience irritation at the injection site, to try a new site.  Apparently some people are more sensitive in certain areas.  Hopefully someone else can help you understand what the irritation feels like so you can help the little guy. My 5 year old gets his dose in his belly and has not mention any itching.  He does however complain of itching when he gets shots in his arm due to the drying effect of alcohol. That could be what is bothering your son. Thank you Thanks for the advice Thanks My son also got a minor rash around the site (thighs) the first couple loading doses. It usually subsided after a day and eventually he did not have a reaction. He is an infant so obviously we could not verbally get any feedback on how it felt, but it never seemed to cause him any major discomfort. Hopefully the reactions will lessen or stop after a few administrations. I do 4-week doses and occasionally I will get slight itchiness on one or both sites (either side of the belly) a couple days after the shot. I have just gotten used to it. For the first month of my Hemlibra, it itched a little bit. It was not like a mosquito bite itch or an allergy itch, but more of \"what is this weird feeling\" itch. Granted, mine was in the stomach area as that is where I do my treatments so it was really odd to me at first never having a treatment done there before. Hi been 2 week since I started hemlibra no problem for the moment, both injection where on my thigh,  the doc told me to privilege the fatty zone and if you Want to do the injection on the belly do not forget to leave 5cm (for an adult, I do not know the exact mesure for kids) around the belly button For kids it is around one to two inches depending on the size of the child. Or so that is what my clinic stated. Also I wanted to add something. I still have to use factor sometimes. I used to have to  infuse every other day, and now I only need to maybe two or three times a month. So Hemlibra has made a huge improvement. But I am worried about people who are new to this thinking that Hemlibra will keep all bleeds at bay. I used to know for sure when I had a bleed because it would get bad quick. Now it is harder to tell, I will bleed slowly into a joint for a few days before it gets bad enough to know I should do something. I am very active, and 45 yrs old, so it may just be that. But I think people need to be aware that bleeds can still happen and do damage. I suggest keeping factor on hand , and if you notice your little guy getting really grumpy or unusually tired, or he does not want to do things, it might be a subtle bleed. That is what happens with me. And since I am so used to knowing what to look for I can recognize it, and treat. But if I did not have so much experience with this I would not know. I have actually already had two really bad elbow bleeds happened since starting Hemlibra, that, since I did not think it could be a bleed (because usually bleeds get bad so fast, and with Hemlibra they do not) I assumed it was tendonitis and kept going. Until it was so bad that I knew it was a bleed. Then it took 3 months of not using my arm, and infusing , which is super difficult and painful. I do not want to seem pessimistic, Hemlibra is a life changer. I just think people should be aware that it basically changes someone is sever hemophilia status to moderate. So treat accordingly and pay attention. Best wishes.  Thanks for the advice, really appreciate!! Yea I went to close to my belly button once. Ouch! There are nerves there!

I am currently on hemlibra for about a year now and have no issue with it. I just saw that post and was wondering the same thing for my son. I know of no other treatment. Lots of new products on the horizon and gene therapy products are coming to market so marketing companies are doing some ground work to determine how to best market to you.  Hemlibra was an early drug in terms of alternative therapy to factor.  The early adopter set went for it.  They are the key market sector for these new products and thus the marketing surveys.  Still working fine. This. And also there might be people who have pre existing bleeding problems , target joints or have had past brain bleeds that Hemlibra does not cover well enough, so they might have trouble with insurance covering Hemlibra and factor for break through bleeds together. Hemlibra is a great option, luckily for me even though I am a heavy bleeder and still have to use factor occasionally on top of my Hemlibra my insurance still covers both. But if it did not then I would have to switch back to prophylactic infusions in order to avoid bad bleeds.\nBut I bet mostly it is people who want to try some of the new genetic stuff. Fear from pharma companies about losing market share would be my guess. The amount of pharmaceutical propaganda is only going to increase. Even insidious stuff like this, that seems innocent, but plants the idea in your head that 'something must be wrong' with a competitor product.

If you were lucky enough to get excellent care from start of life and do not have joint damage that could be one factor.

I used to go as long as possible with out taking a treatment and I never exercised so obviously I would get bleeds as a result. However this year I started running and doing upper body workouts while treating regularly (for the most part) and I have not had a bleed yet. My right elbow always ached (it was a target joint for years) but now I have almost no pain, even when working out. I think you are asking a question that researchers and doctors are still trying to answer.\n\n(\n\n[Coated-platelet levels may explain some variability in clinical\nphenotypes observed with severe hemophilia]( Same here, type A severe, however I do have target joint. My spontaneous bleeds are few and far between as in every 2 or 3 months or more. Less if I am consistent with profylaxis. I would say I deal with able bleeds about 2-3 times a year. The half-life of factor VIII in your body is also important.  If you have a very long half-life, you will be much more protected with two doses a week versus someone with a very short half-life. All good answers here.  Clinical phenotype can vary widely and no one truly knows why a severe may bleed like a mild (and vice versa).  This is one of the reasons the ( genotyping project is so important.  Hopefully they will get re-funded to continue expanding the research database. Factor V Leiden. \n\n\n\nI was about 24 years old when they finally determined that is what I had. It counters my Factor VIII deficiency. I can go months without an infusion. Then I go through these spurts of having to take it every day for two weeks.  **Factor V Leiden**\n\nFactor V Leiden (rs6025) is a variant (mutated form) of human factor V (one of several substances that helps blood clot), which causes an increase in blood clotting (hypercoagulability). With this mutation, the anticoagulant protein secreted (which normally inhibits the pro-clotting activity of factor V) is not able to bind normally to Factor V, leading to a hypercoagulable state, i.e., an increased tendency for the patient to form abnormal and potentially harmful blood clots. Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary hypercoagulability (prone to clotting) disorder amongst ethnic Europeans. It is named after the Dutch city Leiden, where it was first identified in 1994 by Prof R. Bertina et al.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "Kidney bleed I am having a kidney bleed right now.

Ugh Got To mouth bleed under my tongue after making out with a girl last night at the bar.", "Bursitis anyone? Any of you deal with shoulder bursitis? How did you treat it? There is no such thing as a \"shoulder bursitis\", because there are many bursaes in the shoulder region, and a bursitis would be named after the particular bursa that is inflamed.\n\nAlso, a shoulder bursitis is pretty rare, and per my experience, even more rare with a hemophiliac. Thus, the need for a full neuromuskuloskeletal hemophiliac assessment, to get the right diagnosis.\n\nI suggest you consult preferably the physical therapist (PT) from your HTC, a PT with hemophilia experience, or, at last, but carefully, a general PT.\n\nEdit : errors. No but I have had plenty of minor and a few bigger shoulder bleeds. And the small ones feel exactly like bursitis. If you are a symptomatic carrier or mild hemophiliac trickle bleeds can feel like this can be a pain and present the same way bursitis or tendonitis would. When I started Hemlibra my levels went from less than 1% to around 40%, so from severe hemophilia to mild. So my bleeds became less obvious. They would start slow and every time I would assume it was tendonitis or bursitis, as I have supposedly had both in the past, and it felt exactly the same (in both elbows and one shoulder, at different times, since starting Hemlibra). The reason I know it was not any of those things and that it was a bleed, is because only factor would stop it. Or because PT exercises turned it into a full on bad bleed, then only factor would stop it. I would assume as a symptomatic carrier that you have a similar level to 40%. So it makes sense that you will either have to immobilize your shoulder for a while, or treat with factor regularly until it feels better, or ideally, both. I cannot know for sure, but I would be willing to bet this is the case, since you have hemophilia and all. And it never hurts to be safe. That is, if you have access to factor. I do not know your situation so this might sound like strange advise. But I have a symptomatic mom who was the founder of the hemophilia center in our state, which became the model that national uses for all the states now, and she has had issues like this and this is how she would treat it. I have a symptomatic daughter as well who bleeds like a hemophiliac (because she is), and she gets infusions when she needs them. So it could be as simple as a bleed. Hope this makes sense. I have had bursitis related to shoulder damage. I was referred to an orthopedist by my hematologist. A steroid injection into the bursa helped with the symptoms for a bit and the orthopedist also referred me for physical therapy to improve shoulder ROM and strength. The ortho always said I could call and schedule another steroid injection as needed but I found the PT was helping quite a bit so I actually only needed the first one. Thank you, it does! I am doubting it is a bleed because I am on prophy, but maybe... I am only up above 40% for the first day after  I factor up, so it is a possibility... though it does not have some of the tingly or heat sensations I usually feel. hoping any solutions will not cause any bleeding issues!\nPS yes re your daughter actually having hemophilia... hopefully they shift her records to state it as it is!!! Yea they have changed the records recently and prescribed her factor as needed (instead of me using mine!) \nYea since you are on prophy it does not seem like it would be a bleed, but I would still treat it as such for a while as far as rest and all that. And remember too that we can just get plain old injuries too, which as I get older I am getting more of! Shoulder  injuries are especially difficult tho.

My doctor does not prescribe me any painkillers because the local healthcare system (Spain) is pretty strict with those and I would need to visit the hospital every time and get a small dose. \n\nApart from the obvious initial \"ice\" treatment, what do you do ?

Everything was solved in the morning  but during the evening of day 5 the pain went back and it felt like it was not about to stop so I took the decision of injecting my old school factor. \n\nSo my first question is ;  is it \"normal\" to still have those minors bleeds starting pain during first week? I think yes because I am not entirely loaded with Hemlibra yet.   \nAnd the second most important question ; My haematologist told me to inject my next loading dose ( 2x150mg/l - my body weight is 100kilos/220pounds ) TWO weeks after the first one, but I am reading everywhere that I have to inject it 4 times a month during the loading dose period, It is even writen in the books that came with my Hemlibra kit. \n\nMy doctor is on vacation for two weeks ( ... ) I know I am suposed to follow what he says but my body is telling me the opposite, there is no way I could last another entire week without Hemlibra or Factor... \n\nAt least there is allready a plus side, besides those minor \"i am-about-to-bleed\" pains that sometimes kicks in for no reason, I am feeling better than ever, just turned 35 a few months ago but I feel like I am 25 ... morning joints pain have totally dissapeared \n\nThanks for your answers ! I guess it can happen during the first few weeks, when I started about a year ago, the first step was to inject 1ml (150g) every week for a month, than I got down to 0.7ml (100g) every week for about two weeks, to see that it works for this amount. Only than I tested 1ml (150g) every two weeks, after seeing that it works, this is what I inject. In the first week, I think it is normal to have spontaneous bleeds or pain because your body is not fully loaded yet. I had \"feeling\" of bleedings at the start of Hemlibra too for about a month. And for dosing, as much as I heard, that you just double dose (for a few times) at first and that is it, does not matter if its weekly or monthly. Would suggest contacting your local hemophilia association. They might suggest another hematologist to contact if you cannot reach your current one to make sure that everything is okay.

She still needs to know something about hemophilia and von Willebrands.  So, in the interest of teaching the next generation of the hematologists who cover you clotter on the weekends, what is one or two things you wished the basic hematologist knew more about when it comes to VWD? 1) Do not discount us for a minor disease - especially with type III or acquired.\n\n2) If we have to infuse factor as a vWD patient, realize there is no recombinant option...which typically leads us to not wanting to infuse (we all know the history, will not go down that road)\n\n3) Oral / Nose bleeds common...but our achilles heel is internal (especially GI) and head bleeds.  Amicar is life...and to treat mouth bleeds, you can crush the amicar pills with water into a paste and it works directly on the site of a mouth bleed (most insurances do not pay for liquid amicar, more difficult to get than factor).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere are you an attending / are you an attending at an HTC (if you do not want to publicly announce the first part)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf i think of anymore, i will let you know!\n\nSource:  Am MSN Student / Have type 3  I have type 3 vWD, and the issue I run into a lot of the time is confusion over DDAVP and factor replacement. DDAVP works only for Types 1 and 2. Pain management is also a tricky situation. Many doctors have told me to take Aspirin or Naproxen. Both are not safe for vWD patients.\n\nIt is helpful when hematologists listen and be respectful. Most I have dealt with have been very cold and clinical. Looking at the numbers and not the patient. My last major emergency left me with a hemoglobin level of 46. I could not function. My hematologist said I looked okay and I was awake. I begged him for a blood transfusion. I had to BEG.

I think this is the best analysis I have seen so far. \n\n(\n\n Here is some ingredients analysis if you are interested. I have done extensive research on the formulas. So both vaccines are the cleanest, healthiest, and safest vaccines we have ever formulated in the medical world, because of the use of RNA technology without incubation of eggs. They contain no heavy metal immune boosters since RNA technology it is self adjuvanting. They contain no chemical preservatives, and no antibiotics since no live virus is present that needs to be kept in a weakened state.\n\n(\n\nThe inactive ingredients of the Pfizer list are as follows;\u00a0**SUCROSE (6 mg \\),** **LIPID ALC-0315 (0.43 mg \\ \\bis \\bis\\), SODIUM CHLORIDE (0.36 mg \\),** **SODIUM PHOSPHATE (0.07 mg \\), LIPID ALC-0159 (0.05 mg \\, \\), POTASSIUM CHLORIDE (0.01 mg \\), MONOBASIC POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE (0.01 mg \\)**\n\n(\n\nThe inactive ingredients of the Moderna list are as follows;\u00a0***SUCROSE (43.5 mg \\), TROMETHAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (1.18 mg \\), LIPID SM-102 (0.48 mg \\), LIPID PEG-2000-DMG (0.48 mg \\, \\), LIPID DSPC (0.48 mg 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), CHOLESTEROL (0.48 mg), TROMETHAMINE (0.31 mg) \\), SODIUM ACETATE (0.12 mg \\),*** *and* ***ACETIC ACID (0.043 mg \\)***\n\nThe only ingredient some are concerned about which the CDC is currently investigating for allergic reactions in 1 in 1,000,000 patients is PEG or polyethylene glycol. PEG has the potential to be contaminated with ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane because of the ethoxylation method of production. Exposure to ethylene glycol during its production, processing and clinical use has been linked to increased incidents of leukemia as well as several types of cancer. Also please note, there is no evidence that PEG is toxic for any life form. It just has not been used in a vaccine before and the CDC wants an investigation. If it makes you feel any better, the Pfizer vaccine contains 10X less PEG than the Moderna. The Moderna can be kept in a standard domestic or medical freezer unlike the Pfizer, so it is likely that it will be the one more available.\n\nThe catch22 is that the only other questionable ingredient I can find is 4-hydroxybutyl a nitrosamine, which is a lab chemical that is commonly used to induce high-grade invasive cancerous tumors in the urinary bladder of mice for cancer research. However, in concentrations of 90 to 180 mg. It is the second most concentrated inactive ingredient in the Pfizer product.\u00a0It is not something I would worry about.\n\n(\n\n(\n\nNow incredibly listen to this. The Oxford/AstraZeneca contains the cleanest and safest ingredients by far. It uses corn derived ethanol instead of polyethylene glycol, and no other ingredient in the inactive list registered as hazardous material, skin or lung irritant, or as a carcinogen. I could not locate the specific dosage. This is the one that also contains the now infamous genetically modified human embryonic kidney cells listed as \"contains GMO's\" on NHS website, the other two vaccines not containing genetically modified organisms.\u00a0Again that is not something that I would worry about at all.\n\n(\n\n(\n\nThe inactive ingredients of the AstraZeneca list are as follows;\u00a0***L-HISTIDINE, L-HISTIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE MONOHYDRATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE HEXAHYDRATE (salt), POLYSORBATE 80, ETHANOL, SUCROSE (SUGAR), SODIUM CHLORIDE (SALT), DISODIUM EDETATE DIHYDRATE (SALT), WATER***\n\nIt is being implemented around the world in Brazil, Russia, UK, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Argentina but sadly not in the United States as of yet. Ironically because the CDC is \u201cskeptical\u201d about its data's effectiveness, even though the FDA fast tracked the approval for the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer. I really hope it becomes available soon. If you read the ingredients list it really is the cleanest out of the three, and a scientific breakthrough which removes heavy metals and preservatives in our vaccines. I hope America does what Russia and UK are doing and approve the best one out of the lot.

I had been suppressing bleeds and muscles issues with prophylaxis and Voltaren Gel when the muscles ache. However an annual routine checkup recently revealed abnormal heartbeats. It seems like use of diclofenac is a cause for the development of abnormal heartbeats. Since we cannot use aspirin-based creams and if the diclofenac-based creams are also to be ruled out, what other choice is there? I know it is not possible everywhere but I live in a legal state and weed does the trick. I am not sure how relevant these would be to your particular scenario, but other common topical product ingredients include menthol, lidocaine, and capsaicin. Depending in your abnormal heart rate, though, lidocaine could probably be ruled out. I use a cbd/menthol cream and it usually does enough for me.  Sometimes I will use voltaren as well if the cbd does not do the trick. Cooling gels/freeze sprays/cool gel packs help, diclofenac is a very similar drug to aspirin anyway so should def be used carefully anyway. \nHave you tried talking to your doctor? Maybe find a product for prophylaxis that does not make your muscles ache? It is not the Factor VIII that is causing the ache. It can be due to walking too much or standing too long. I will try putting a fever gel pack on the muscle next time and see if it can replace diclofenac. And I actually just had a review with my HTC recently but the abnormal hearbeat thing was only detected after that. What is cbd? Ah i see! Hmm yeah, rest and ice probably your best bet for muscle pain! Are you getting follow up with cardiology? They are supposed to give some device to wear for a day to monitor the heartbeat soon. So in the meantime, I have stopped using Voltaren and I guess that is it. Really weird to take your own pulse and find a missing heartbeat. Maybe I am turning into the undead. Hehe well it is 2020. Zombies are the next logical step! \n\nGood luck!! CBD is cannabidiol, the main anti-inflammatory component in marijuana.  It does not get you high.  It is, however, most effective when used in combination with some THC (the compound that can get you high).  A 1:1 ratio is ideal, but lower works, too.  There are tons of really great topical CBD products on the market that are legal in all 50 states.  Look for some with \"broad spectrum\" hemp or similar.  100% THC free just means it does not have enough to be detectable but many still have just enough to still be effective for pain management.  If you are in a state with legal weed, a dispensary can help hook you up with some stonger stuff.", "Any experience with Arthrosis? Hey guys I\u2018m a severe type A hemophiliac from germany (sorry for my bad english :D) at the age of 24. Last december I got the diagnosis that I have arthrosis in my right ankle, because of many bleedings in my childhood. I knew it would happen someday, but I did not expect it to come so soon and it hit me hard. I never talked to other hemophiliacs but now I think it is the right time! Does anybody else have problems with their joints or especially with arthrosis at a young age? Feel free to tell me your storys! Guten tag. \n\nI have what (I think) you are calling arthrosis (we usually call it degenerative arthritis or hemophilic arthropathy here in the states). \n\nI am also a severe hemophilia A (with inhibitor) patient. I always bled into my ankles primarily as a kid before my hemophilia was well controlled. As a result I have a severe case of arthropathy in both of my ankles, probably first diagnosed with arthropathy at 12 or so. When I was ~17 years old we decided to go ahead and perform a radiation synovectomy on the worst ankle to stop the bleeds. That led to the bones eventually fusing together and my ankle no longer moving. The other ankle moves some but not much, and they are both quite painful. I just take celecoxib to take the edge off and keep my. Mobility Up. \n\nI am 29 now. I can no longer run, and bicycling has become difficult without severe pain. I can move around fine for work (I am an engineer) and am reasonably active (I work on cars for fun, and I keep chickens, garden etc. ) But constant pain. \n\nYou, friend, can do better than me. My joints were trash by the time I was a teenager, and I was too immature/dumb to understand the importance of physical therapy. I believe if you work with your hematologist/physical therapist to determine the correct exercise for you and do them religiously, watch your weight and keep your bleeding under control, you can do well and manage this without harming your quality of life. \n\nGood luck!  Thank you so much man! This is why I came here, wish you all the best Had both knee replaced at 25 (last year). Had an ankle arthroscopy as well. Based on my experience, try to hold on if you can with pain medications. I was taking celebrex but did not helped after that I was on some opioids which helped a little but the side effects so bad, like tiredness all the time. If pain medicines does not make much difference, go and see an orthopedic. You may have to get an arthroscopy or a joint replacement if it is too bad. Even though  going through a joint replacement process is so hard but if you keep pushing yourself with exercises and everything after the replacement, it really pays off.\n\nIf you do replacement you might have to re-do it again or do a revision after 10-20 years. Do not be hard on yourself. You are a warrior! We all did stupid stuffs as kids. We wanted to play and be stupid like other normal kids. I am only 26 now &amp; STILL at college, have a part-time job because I need to pay the out of pocket insurance and stuff.\n\nWhen I grew up I did not had any factor. We used to get expired factor (very limited doses) donations about every 2-4 years. Which we used to keep for emergency situations. That means I used to take factor which was expired years ago. It was so hard growing up. You see my earlier comment about how I am doing now. Hey bro. From experience take care of it as much as you can now. It only took me three years after my diagnosis that I needed to start getting cortisone shots to be able to get through every day life. It only gets worse after every bleed so the more protection you give yourself now like good shoes with support, maybe some orthotics, diet and proper excise etc. the longer you are going to be able to maintain a higher quality of life. Please take care of yourself because I did not and I regret it big time. Sorry to hear about your situation so early on. However do not be disheartened. \n\nSee a musculoskeletal and a PM&amp;R specialist. There are ways to strengthen the muscles around the affected joints so that their load is reduced. It is a slow and long journey, but life can definitely be better than it is now. \n\nDo post about your progress. You are not alone here. Same here 23 year old Hemophilic Factor 8 with inhibitors on himlibra for 2 and half years \nDiagnosed for Hemophilic arthrosis on my right ankle 9 months ago.\nSome things that help are custom designed sole for your ankle which helps when walking.\nGood supportive shoes. I recommend mountain hiking shoes which have high length and good padding .\nAnd soak your ankle in warm water for 15-20 minutes in morning ( only when there is no bleeding in the ankle)\nIf you took care of your ankle in a good way the replacement surgery can be postponed by 7-10 years.\nThere are some medicine as well but take them according to your doctors instructions Thank you so much for your stories and kind words! Very glad to be here Hello my friend. I am 31 yrs old now with severe hemophilia A and osteoarthritis like you in my left ankle which developed an osteophyte after many times of bleeding. What I need to do at some point is to remove this with arthroscopy. Nowadays it starts to swell everytime I walk too much (more than 2 km) but with a little rest, some ice and some ice gel it gets better. That does not prevent me from doing the stuff that I want but sometimes it can be frustrating when you are limited with a swollen ankle. Ask your hematologist to bring you in touch with an orthopedic doctor who specilises in haemophilic arthroparhy. There are many new treatments you can try to improve its condition. I had an extremely similar situation (Type A severe, 24yo male, severe hemophilic arthropathy of the left ankle joint) and I have made 2 posts regarding my journey. I ended up getting an ankle distraction arthroplasty and I believe this was the best option for me. \n\nGood luck with your situation, you are not alone! That Is really interesting! I will definitely ask my orthopedist  about it in march altough google research doesnt gave many results for it here in germany. Thanks for sharing your story, keep us updated! What would be interesting for me too: in which stage of pain / mobility have you been when they made the arthroplasty? How long could you walk, was there pain even if you didnt walk, could you do sports, did you do physio therapy? I will answer these &amp; update my post just in case others see it there too. \n\nI was in severe pain &amp; extremely limited mobility (the subtalar joint of my ankle autofused already, the primary ankle joint had bone spurs &amp; almost zero ROM). It hurt first thing in the morning 8/10, and after walking on it for 30 minutes it diminished to 6/10 but would still be painful during any weight bearing activity. Sports were 100% not an option, nor was running. It impacted my life for upwards of 3 years to the point I could not work or get much enjoyment out of most activities. It was affecting my mental health as well. \n\nI actually still have the ankle distractor on for another month, and I will keep posting updates once the recovery process is over. So far though, I already notice less pain &amp; *significantly* increased mobility (I can move my ankle up and down in the hinged fixator). I will have to get Physical Therapy once the ankle fixator is removed, but I cannot give you any notes on that until I do it. \n\nAgain, best of luck and do not be afraid to exhaust all possible options. I had to travel in order to get this surgery and I believe everyone should do their due diligence on researching all outcomes before getting any life changing surgery. Hallo,\n\nbin selber aus Deutschland und 32 Jahre alt mit schwerer H\u00e4mophilie A. Habe ebenfalls durch massiv viele Blutungen Arthrose im rechten Kn\u00f6chel seit ich Kleinkind bin. Habe allerdings relativ viel Gl\u00fcck gehabt, da ich \u00fcber meinen Vater Kontakt zu einem damals sehr bekannten Sportarzt im Bereich Leichtathletik bekam. Im Zuge der Wachstumsphase als Kind konnte das durch diverse Nahrungserg\u00e4nzungsmittel gut unter Kontrolle gebracht werden (der Teufelskreis aus Entz\u00fcndungen und dadurch verursachten Blutungen konnte unterbrochen werden).  \n\nUnter Prophylaxe war als Jugendlicher so eigentlich alles an Sport und Aktivit\u00e4ten m\u00f6glich. Mit etwa 10 kam aber der linke Ellenbogen dazu, den ich auch nicht mehr ganz grade strecken kann. Mit 18 dann zus\u00e4tzliche Arthrose im linken Sprunggelenk. Viel Sport habe bis etwa Anfang 20 gemacht, ab da haben dann doch die Schmerzen \u00fcberhand genommen f\u00fcr viele Sachen. Reines Krafttraining geht aber noch sehr gut. \n\nIch muss sagen, dass die Schmerzen in den letzten 2 Jahren wieder weniger geworden sind und auch im Alltag nicht mehr so st\u00f6ren. Ich kann allerdings nicht sagen, ob das an evtl. anderer Ern\u00e4hrung oder anderer signifikanter Faktoren liegt. W\u00fcrde mich sogar trauen wieder mehr Sport zu treiben. Durch Corona ist nat\u00fcrlich alles derzeit irgendwie bl\u00f6d.\n\nVersuch so lange es geht die Beweglichkeit zu erhalten. Denk ggf. \u00fcber gesunde und ausgewogene Ern\u00e4hrung nach, ich denke damit kann man schon viel tun. \n\n*english:*\n\n*Hi, am from Germany myself and 32 years old with severe haemophilia A. I have had osteoarthritis in my right ankle since I was a toddler due to massive bleeding into it. However, I was relatively lucky because my father made contact with a sports doctor in the field of athletics who was very well known at the time. In the course of the growth phase as a child, this could be brought under good control with various dietary supplements (the vicious circle of inflammation caused by bleeding could be interrupted).* \n\n*With prophylaxis, as a teenager, practically everything in sport and activities was possible. But when I was around 10, my left elbow was getting bad. I can no longer straighten it out completely. At the age of 18 there was additional osteoarthritis in the left ankle. I did a lot of sport until my early twenties, from then on the pain got out of hand for many things, but pure strength training still goes very well.* \n\n*I have to say that the pain has decreased in the last 2 years and is no longer a problem in everyday life. However, I cannot say whether this is possibly due to a different diet or other significant factors. I would even dare to do more sports again. But because of Corona everything is kind of stupid right now.* \n\n*Try to maintain mobility as long as possible. If necessary, think about a healthy and balanced diet, I think you can do a lot with that.* Hey :)\n\nHab auch schwere H\u00e4mophilie A und bin 36 Jahre alt. Seit meiner Jugend habe ich Arthritis in den Sprungelenken. Es belastet mich nicht sehr, bin es ja gewohnt. Alles was auf die Sprunggelenke geht wie laufen, Fussball oder lange wandern verursacht bei mir Schmerzen in den Gelenken danach. Deshalb mach ich das weniger. Radfahren geht z.B. super.\n\nWas ich auch bemerkt habe ist, dass die Ern\u00e4hrung die Situation stark beeinflusst. Ein Arzt hat mir mal gesagt, die \u00dcbers\u00e4uerung des K\u00f6rpers ist das Problem. Ich weiss eigentlich genau was die Schmerzen schlimmer macht: Alkohol, Zigaretten, Fleisch (vor allem Wurst), Zucker.... ich versuche diese Dinge zu reduzieren, bin aber auch nicht ganz streng zu mir.. man muss ja auch noch leben :)\n\nLiebe Gr\u00fcsse Bluterbruder\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have severe haemophilia A and am 36 years old. I have had arthritis in my ankles since I was young. It does not bother me very much, I am used to it. Everything that affects my ankle joints, such as running, football or long walks, causes pain in my joints afterwards. That is why I do it less. Cycling, for example, is great. What I also noticed is that diet has a huge impact on the situation. A doctor once told me that the problem is over-acidification of the body. I actually know exactly what makes the pain worse: alcohol, cigarettes, meat (especially sausage), sugar ... I try to reduce these things, but I am not very strict with myself ... you still have to live: ) Greetings blood brother What do you mean by \"fused\"?\n\n/ Type A Moderate Basically the joint is gone and the bones \"Fuse\" together.

I assume if you damaged the penis and broke blood vessels it would be a problem. And just like all bleeding, it would take longer to heal. That does not happen during typical sexual activities. Including masturbation. Maybe normal bleeding people have bruised their penis during sex? I would assume if a hemophiliac did this it could merit an infusion? But I do not think that is common.

Hi, I have Type 2A VWD and I am after some advice from a non-medical perspective. I want to hear what other people who suffer from bleeding disorders have to say on the matter.\n I used to skateboard a lot as a kid/ young teen but eventually grew out of it after a few too many injuries and rolled ankles. Recently, my local council has finally built a free skatepark and I have started to get back on the board.

I am not overly concerned about the risks of head injuries and bruising from falling over, but more the damage I could be doing to knee and ankle joints by constantly landing tricks.

What advice would you give to 20 year old you? I feel like asking the same question to a nonhemophiliac, I would get a different answer. This is hard, because medical tech and insurance laws have changed dramatically over the years so my experience might not apply. \n\nEven though my case was mild, I was told to sit out of gym class and avoid all team sports, leading to life long issues in feelings about sports and exercise. But by the time we hit \u201c20 years ago\u201d, when I was an old teen, knowledge about treatment,  drugs, insurance had improved, but I did not know about it. So I guess 3 pieces of advice:\n\n1. Exercise, exercise, exercise. \n2. Stay current about hemophilia news, and even if mild, see a specialist regularly. This may impact where you live as an adult since you will probably have to drive or ride to a big city. \n3. How health insurance works and what it covers in your country or employer is literally a life or death issue\u2014being politically disengaged, as I was 20 years ago, is not an option. There are not many older hemophiliacs.   I was born in the 1970s.  50% of us caught HIV as children, before the HIV drugs were released.  90% of us caught HepC, which has only recently been cured.\n\nOur world is far too different from your world for the advice to matter. I am 32. I was the same as others and told to stay out of contact sports and heavy physical activity. I picked up ice hockey when I was 25 and I would say it was the best decision of my 20s. That said, I am mild so it might not be such a good idea for a severe. My suggestion is, though, to take full advantage of your 20s when you will be in peak physical condition. Push yourself to open your mind and try new things, because you will be more adverse to it as you get older. Maybe this is just good general life advise.\n\nAlso start saving for retirement. Yeah, there is lots of general life advice that is the same whether you have hemophilia or not:  Try new things. Consider moving to a different place, even if only temporarily. If your employer matches retirement savings, save at least enough to get the full benefit. Know yourself and set yourself up for success: if you have problems controlling yourself around credit cards or drugs or snack foods or whatever, do not tell yourself some story about how you are going to magically have more self control in the future, instead cut whatever that is out of your life entirely. It is not fair but we are not all the same and do not all have the same weaknesses. Make sure you know how to be happy and financially stable on your own before you introduce romantic partners or kids into your life; neither of those things make it easier, and it is not fair or realistic to rely on another human for your own self worth or happiness. If you struggle in dating, do not fall for the lies about women liking bad men or 'the friend zone'; people of both sexes like interesting and confident people, and love and sex is not something you 'earn' with kindness. Be interesting, and if you are unusual, look for friends and lovers among other unusual people; do not adopt a fascade to attract people you do not really want to be around anyway. Spend extra money on experiences, not on things. Things are a pain to move around and come and go, but experiences will be with you forever. Invest in education and career development, but do not be afraid of getting it wrong; lots of us live different lives than we imagined at 20. Consider being politically active; unless you have a young child you probably have more time and energy for this than you will any time in your life; but be aware a common blind spot for young people, especially young men, is to judge people by impossibly high black and white standards of morality; in fact few people are purely good or evil, and the same person may have both honorable and dishonorable motivations for their actions. Treat prophylactically as often as required. Those bleeds into joints have a cumulative impact. At 53 I have two knee replacements and an elbow that barely works. You kids should be able to avoid that if you treat like hell. And try to get into a gene therapy trial ASAP. Take your prophy on the schedule they tell you. It is what allows you to do the things you want to do. Bleeds in your joints add up. If you have a breakthrough treat fast and then rest it. The better you treat your bleeds now the less problems you have later. I am 38 and got on prophy early. Thankfully my joints are in good shape and I do not have any problems with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind a job you enjoy that is not reliant on you doing something physical if you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not let hemophilia define your life. Prophy prophy and prophy stick to takin your medecine as scheduled.. Great posts in this thread.  I agree with all of them.\n\nI started saving in my early twenties and it is the best thing I did.  Particularly with the uncertainties and setbacks that come with life as a hemophiliac, it is great to build up money to fall back on in case you need it.\n\nAlso, I am 37 and just now addressing mental health issues that I am realizing I have always had.  Pay attention to your mental health.  We all have to go through a lot of stress and it can have an effect. I was born in late1968, I have severe Hemo B. When factor was available to me in 1978, I used it regularly. They told us then that if we treated a bleed with 3 hours it would not cause damage. I always treated my bleeds right away.  In my early 20s my hematologist suggested I try to excercise regularly to strengthen muscles and prevent bleeds. I did and worked, I got into shape and lifted weights and went 9 months without a bleed  that was the longest I have ever gone between bleeds, and that was on demand. Now I am almost 51 and prophy 2 times a week.  As I have gotten older, I have had more issues with arthritis and joint damage but I still excercise regularly, walking mainly, but getting into shape as a young person has kept my joints in relatively good shape. I would say exercise and treat and you will be ok.", "Day to day life ..... Hi all, I was wondering if you could help me. \n\nI have a new friend with haemophilia B and although I do know a little bit about it, I do not know what it is like living with it. \n\nI am trying to understand their life I guess, what they are comfortable and uncomfortable doing, any limitations they may have that I have probably not even considered, and just what daily life is like for them. \n\nI am afraid of bombarding them with questions, but I would really like to know what I can do when they are not feeling great, how I can be of any support etc \n\nI hope this makes abit of sense, \n\nXxx Hemophilia patients are not monolithic; people lead different lives depending on a number of factors including their severity, what sort of treatment they are receiving, longstanding issues they might have if they are older (joint damage etc).\n\nThese days, if you are in a country with modern medical care and have access to prophylactic factor (or better!), your life is \"normal\" in relation to about 90-95% of the average population. Even higher than that if you are younger and on one of the newer drugs.\n\nThis post is admirable, but do not ask us how you should interact with a stranger we do not know - ask them. This is a great response. Luckily, your friend has a more common type of hemophilia, so it is really likely that he can treat himself, as Sokol mentioned. \n\nEven for people who have rare bleeding disorders (I have a factor 1 deficiency) who cannot infuse preemptively due to the cost, there are other ways to do the same thing as anyone else. I still snowboard, but now I wear hip and knee pads with wrist guards plus a helmet. If you want to do something badly enough, you will find a way. You seem like a great friend! I would just explain to this person that you know they probably lead a normal life, but is there anything off limits or activities that might require adaptations so they can be included? I think you have misunderstood what I am asking perhaps, im not asking how I should interact with them personally, I understand everyone is different. I was just asking if there are things I should consider that maybe I would not have thought twice about. Im worried about my lack of knowledge and understanding and I was just hoping to gain a bit of information here. Thank you, yes I agree these are things that I do need to ask \ud83d\ude0a &gt; Im worried about my lack of knowledge and understanding and I was just hoping to gain a bit of information here.\n\nWe can offer you a billion different circumstances and scenarios based on our individual experiences, but the only circumstances you *need* to know about are the ones your friend is facing. Yes ok. Thanks anyway", "I could not walk for a MONTH!

I hope it is better now :)", "My Life Story. So finally after being a lurker of this subreddit and that I am almost 22. I decided to create a user and share my story so here goes.\n\nI will keep it short. I was diagnosed with Severe Hemophilia A when I was nine months old and let me tell you life sucks. It really sucks I personally refer to it as my curse... The messed up hand of cards I was dealt. However a few years back I have grown to accept it but even then I still have times where I lose it. I have anger issues, pain is the only thing I can actually feel. My left elbow is damaged and my right ankle is probably on the way. Thing is I have many regrets. Things I wanted to do, Careers I wanted to chase all crushed by this curse of mine. And it affects me sometimes. I dropped out of school as I could not deal with it. I have learned everything I know by myself and I plan on studying Programming as that is like the only thing I can do. Family tries to support me but honestly I am detached and cannot be bothered. Thanks for reading I just needed to vent.\n\nTLDR: Hemophilia Sucks!", " I do not always roll a joint, but when I do.... It is my ankle. I love that the shit posts get way more up votes than everything else here Someone make a hemophiliac gold for this man", "Canada OKs new BiogenIdec longer-lasting Hemophilia B drug. Sets stage for US FDA decision in a couple of days. ", "Synovium surgery/radiology Hi,\n\nI am a severe A Haemophilia/Hemophiliac from the UK that is had problems with his elbow joints since around the age of 10, I am unable to get full flexion in my elbows and cannot twist them all the way, I sometimes struggle with medication but have not had a severe bleed in a year or so at age 20 (I do not get them so often even twinges; I do not infuse on a schedule for the most part, terrible I know but, my confidence with self infusion and unavailability of assistance makes it difficult sometimes)\n\nMy doctors have suggested that I should get radio yttrium synovium treatment and surgery as a last resort, I am just wondering if anybody here has had any dealings with it and if it has been life changing, I struggle with exposing my arms because of this and I work in IT making moving equipment (nothing major of course) difficult sometimes on them and especially during high temperatures and stubbornness to not show them so i am walking around nearly passing out with a pullover hoodie on etc.\n\nAny advice or constructive criticism is welcomed, I am motivated to change - I just do not get much contact with other Hemo's.\n\nThank you very much. Speaking as a Severe A who cannot fully extend his right arm due to repeated target joint bleeds as a kid:\n\n1. Get your shit together and stick to a prophylaxis schedule. Talk to your HTC, get a nurse to sit down with you and help you work through it (maybe they can send someone to your house, I do not know how it works there). You are young enough to be able to prevent this sort of long-term damage.\n\n2. I have had arthroscopic synovectomies on both of my ankles and they turned out very well, but of course there are occasional stiffness/soreness issues. The difference is that if you cannot use your legs, you can still sit at a desk at work. IF you cannot use your arms, you are *fucked*.\n\n3. I had surgery to treat ulnar impaction (or impingement?) on my right elbow last year. If your elbows are fucked, this is a legitimate problem you may face in the future that could lead to loss of sensation in your fingers and even being unable to user your hands if it gets really severe. DO NOT LET IT GO THAT LONG. Work on figuring out what is causing you to not be on time with your prophylaxis. Sounds like you are full of anxiety\u2014talk to your nurse practitioner. They wanted to do a synovectomy on my right elbow when I was about 12 (24 now), but I did not do it.\n\nI can honestly say that it is highly unlikely to heal without surgery, but if you stick to prophylaxis and do not let yourself get a *single bleed* there, it might not worsen.  If it were me I would probably try to delay any decisions about invasive joint procedure until after I see how things go after Hemlibra is approved for patients without inhibitors.  I have a feeling it could make a big difference for you. I had yttrium injections in both knees when I was a teenager now I am in my 30's. To cut a long story short I have 2 knee replacements so said injections did sweet f\\*\\*k all. \n\nI have other friends older and in my age bracket who have fused elbows, which I can only imagine is crap. You definitely do not want that. I have had many bleeds over the years in my elbows but have 80degs of range in each, work in IT (nearly 20yrs) and manage to complete most tasks assigned to me.\n\nFYI I did not have prophylaxis/self infusion as an option in my life but suggest as with others keeping on top of that to try and preserve what you motion/range you have. Surgery/Stem Cells maybe an option later down the track. But remember to never give up. 3. This just started recently happening to me. My elbow has been bad for years, but I noticed that now when its really bad, part of my thumb pad is going numb.. How did the surgery work for you? SEE AN ORTHOPEDIST RIGHT NOW.\n\nI first noticed it when I had a marathon PS4 session and my pinkie/ring finger were kind of numb/tingly. I thought I had just been sitting/holding the controller weirdly but it lasted a couple days, then I mentioned it next time I saw my hematologist and he sent me straight to orthopedics who diagnosed it immediately. My grip strength in that hand was something like 15kg below that of my dominant (left) hand when the difference is usually supposed to be around 5kg at most, and the ortho said if I did not get the surgery soon I would be at risk of permanent damage.\n\nFortunately the surgery went great and I was back to holding a (very heavy) camera in around 4 months; a year later I had improved sensation in all of my fingers and my grip was much stronger. The fingers in question still get a bit tingly if I am resting my arm on the chair for too long (because in the end they just shifted the nerve) or if the weather's weird but it was absolutely the right decision. Will do. I saw one about 10 years ago who told me it was not bad enough to warrant surgery. I have not lost any strength yet, but I agree, should get it checked out again. Thx. I would definitely go for the arthroscopic synovectomy i had them when i was 13 on both elbows..really helped out a few years.. at age 26 i had my right elbow replaced and my range of motion is not all there but no more swelling no more pain.. just soreness from time to time I am having the same problem now. My media nerve is tingling from my shoulder to my pinky. Any other feedback on your ulnar impaction surgery (I.e. Outpatient procedure?, % of recovery, bleeds?)?\n\nI have been doing PT for about a year. Gained a little range of motion back, however the nerve pain is coming on strong! I stick to my prophy for the most part, infusing Idelvion 1xweek.\n\nPrefer not to have surgery, unless it is a must. Back in the day (18 years ago) I had a few radiation synovectomies, which provided reprieve, but it was short lived.\n\nAppreciate the advice! It worked out pretty well - I still have issues if I sleep on it weirdly or lean on it for a long time, but no bleeds. Have also had issues in my thumbs that is apparently some sort of arthritic thing on and off but I have managed it well enough.\n\nHonestly if you are getting tingly nerve pain, you should just go ahead with the surgery.", "Temperature limit I am wondering if anyone can tell me what happens if my advate exceeds the temperature limit of 86 degrees. I ask because my AC unit went out and I had my meds in boxes. I know they reached the limit and am now weary to take a dose. Dont know about advate, but octanate, imunate and refacto...if they past the minimum packege temperature and heat up, there good to go for 3months...you cant cool them again, that is what the package says...\nFrom personal experience, I had some factor the overheat and I but it back in the frige...worked ok... Ok. Yeah if anything I figured it would change potency of it. Other non-hemo individuals told me it would be ok. I just wondered if anyone had any actual experience. I would just call your HTC. I forget what the limits are and how much it will reduce effectiveness.\n\nI recently had a shipment of hemlibra that I missed due partly to my fault and in part because of ups not getting their info straight, and I have had two breakthroughs as I am getting back on it. \n\nJust call your HTC. They should be fine, I have used Advate that was stored above 86\u00b0 for a few days from a power outage. The efficacy could be impacted slightly, but will still be functional for bleeds just in case. \n\nBut the bottom line is to contact your Hematologist/Health Care professionals, for the final say. \n\nI am not sure about your situation, but when I have had questions about bleeds, medications, etc., My hematologist will always respond within the same day. \n\nHope this helps! Thanks you!! I plan on contacting my doc, just been hectic with the AC still out, trying to get it fixed and dealing with this foot bleed. Your reply answered my concerns, obviously nothing is certain and official word from docs are best, but this provided same relief. Given my meds were in the 86-90 degree range for a few hours, I feel a little better about it. It will not hurt you. If anything It just might not be as affective. But I have never refrigerated my factor and it works fine. There has to be some limit they put on the packaging but it has never seemed to matter", "How do you guys do it? I have VWD type 1 and I feel like I am suffering sometimes because of it. Blood pouring out of my nose for hours and hours on end. Being seen as a \u201cnose-picker\u201d/munchy every time I go to the ER, multiple times a week. This does not happen now because I am stable on factor but still. I am supposed to have the least severe bleeding disorder? That is crazy. I cannot imagine how hard it must be to have it worse. Keep trekking on guys. Yeah, it sucks. I stubbed my toe so hard that I heard some cracks a few hours ago. I have factored up and lay here praying that the toe is not broken ER medical staff is only good at the general medical field, anything remotely out of the ordinary and they will stop at nothing accusing you of wasting their time. Finding a nurse or ER Dr who knows about VWD is so rare that I actually started crying when I did not have to defend myself and my VWD type 2 to my doctor when I went it after my nose refused to stop for 6 hours. We are the bruised, but not broken, warriors of the realm of invisible pain.    I would like to say with pain comes wisdom!   \n\nDo you know where the nose bleeds stem from?    I had something done to reduce my nasal turbinates to breathe better.   The doc numbs ya up, and then inserts a needle...  i will let you do the reading.  \n\nAlso, for what it is worth, he said that usually people are put under for this.  Nah... not for me!  I have toughed it out twice.    Only takes 5 minutes, and you are numb, so close your eyes and hold the nurse's hand. Ugh nose bleeds are so annoying. I would usually rather have an internal one. At least there is no clean up then. A couple years ago I started having a lot more nose bleeds than usual and my HTC sent me to an ENT (ear nose throat) doctor. He was able to basically cauterize the capillaries in my nostrils that were apparently a little too close to the surface and kept bleeding. It felt pretty weird but was very quick and relatively painless. I have had one or two very small nose bleeds since then, but nothing even close to what it was. Talk to your hematologist and see if they can recommend  someone like that for you. They think it is just my VWD doing it is thing. I have had more cauterizations than I can count on my hands, and I have also had a surgical cauterization (aka under general anesthesia) via endoscope and nothing looks wrong. Good luck Even after I say I have VWD, and show them my medical bracelet, they still sometimes think I am a munchy and/or have no idea what it is. I have already had that more times than I can count. They do not work for me. The only thing that helps my nose bleeds are DDAVP, FVIII, and Endoscopic electrolysis In simple terms, if you got factor it is manageble...if you dont have factor it is a shitstorm during a wildfire. Done both...\n\nBut you got to move on! Yeah that is pretty standard for ER staff. Do not even get me started on dentists thou. Does not matter how much you say you have VWD they will still poke you with a pointy end and start accusing you of not brushing because \"You are bleeding aaaaaaaa loooooot\" Yeah idiot, I fking told you! One day at a time.\n\nI used to have frequent nose bleeds. And 1-2 squares of toliet paper folded up really helped. The porous material is similar to gauze, and promotes clotting. dango!   Well, I guess bleeding to the outside is better than the inside.  Just ask all of the fused ankles in the group  :) Lol", "How do i stop a inside bleed Hi hem A severe. Never gotten many bleeds but am wondering how do i stop them cause i think i got one in my shin cause its hot. What do i do? Go see a hematologist. Are you being serious? I see you posted and discussed taking factor / hemlibra / inhibitors etc... and now you are asking where to even start with a bleed for your severe complex bleeding disorder as well as with almost no real information to go on (Severe Hemo A with a hot shin)... \n\nFirst off, I would very much recommend reading up on Hemophilia and general best practices laid out by Medical Professionals and if possible to see and talk to a Hemo Medical Professional as well. Even if just over the phone/skype. There are other important Hemo links in the sidebar with more info too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a personal, anecdotal answer to your medical question. From my experiences, heat and a straining feeling in a joint/area usually means the start of a bleed. When possible, I would Rest, Ice, Compress, Elevate as often as life allowed me to (with school/work etc...). If you have/can afford the medicine (factor/etc...) especially in severe patients it is always beneficial to start on medicine as soon as possible when you know you have a bleed. I would normally use the R.I.C.E. method above, use my minor Hemo medicine (DDAVP) right away and if the bleed progresses into the extreme category then take my major Hemo meds (Factor). \n\n\nAll in all though, I very much recommend visiting a Doctor/Medical Professional though to learn more. While this forum is a good place to discuss Hemo and Hemo related issues, medical advice from random strangers on the internet should always be taken with a grain of salt. Ty There is no need for a length reply so here is what you need to know/do: To stop an internal bleed, you need Factor. In order to know which Factor you need, you need to see a Hematologist. Lastly, while the bleed is present, apply ice on and off in 10min intervals(avoid frostbite and promote circulation) to reduce as much inflammation on the site as possible. Ok. What do you mean which type of factor though isnt there only one? Factor 8. Or am i wrong Yes, there are multiple factor types. A quick google search will give you the answer to your question specifying the exact Factors present in a Humans body. If you are type A severe then factor 8 is the one you need. Do you have a prescription for factor? If so, infuse the amount recommended for your weight to stop a bleed. Also, rest (do not walk, you can use crutches if you have them) ice the shin, and elevate it. Do this now even if you do not have factor. Stay off of your shin, do not put weight on it or walk for the next few days probably, or until\nThe pain and swelling, or heat is gone.  \nIf you do not have a prescription for factor 8 then call your treatment centers or dr. Where are you located? Ya i got factor on me. Ill elevate and walk on it very little in the following days. Ty You said before you did not think you ever had a bleed. Did you crack your shin on something? Or were you running and now it hurts? Obviously, get your factor. If you banged into something, then a cold pack might be more helpful than with muscle soreness. Cold can help slow the bleeding making the bruise a bit smaller and less painful. But do not go too crazy if your skin is not used to cold. You want to cool it down, not freeze it. You are not a steak. Well ya ive almost never experienced bleeds like this for some reason. But i ran like 50% more then usual. and ive had this pain twice in my life right there. This year twice. It lasted for like 2 days last time. Its like an irritation. But now it feels kind of normal and not hot but irritations stil there if i use the muscle though You do not sound like you give factor very often. Usually when a bleed has gotten out of control, I end up having to give Factor for a few days in a row. There is a chart to show the amount of factor to raise your level to for the different types of bleeds and for the number of infusions to be given. That also varies depending on the type of factor you have, whether it is extended half life or the original type.\n\nAs for the various types of factors, if you can catch a glimpse of your haemophiliac treatment centre's factor storage, you will see different types of factors there and they serve different purposes. have you looked up shin splints? I take mine everyother day but when its serious or i got an upcoming event i take it 2 days in a row 1. Infuse factor \n2. Call your HTC\n3. RICE It (rest, ice, compression, elevate) 1. Call your hematologist or treatment center\n2. There is an article put out by HemoTalk.tk", "Abstracts from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) 2021 Virtual Congress (\n\n(\n\n(", "Tips for sore joints (Haem Arthropathy) Hey folks sorry for my english I am from Germany,   \nI am 25 and since last year my ankles condition got very bad. My orthopedist says the only long term option is to fuse the joints, but I want to wait a little more. Sometimes the pain is nearly unnoticeable (after a long time of rest) and sometimes, like now, when I walked a lot, it feels like they are ignited. No  bleeding, it just feels like they are sore or something like that. Do you guys have any tips for this phase? I know cooling helps, but maybe any other things that help you out in this stage? Thank you a lot already! I take a turmeric / curcumin supplement everyday and it helps a bit. Also wearing a wrap on my ankles when I am going for longer walks. My doctor prescribed Celebrex but I do not take it very often. If you like swimming, I highly recommend it! I also think using a sauna is great for joints. The heat helps with stiffness. Drink lots of water and try to to have too many sugars. I find alcohol makes my joints hurt a lot.\n\nI also use a cream called Voltaren here in Canada, the main ingredient is diclofenac. I do not know if there is anything like that in Germany. A question about the wrap: I feel like after I take it off, the joint is more unstable than before. Do you feel the same effect? Or does the feeling pass when you take it off at evening and go to sleep? Thank you for your answer! Yeah we have Voltaren here as well, maybe I should try it! Try dipping your ankle in warm water for 10 mins in morning, and wear good quality shoes which supports your ankle while walking, by doctors recommendations I have custom made soles for shoes as well. I have not had cartiledge in my ankle for probably 25 yrs.. they actually ended up basically fusing themselves together from all the friction and pressure and lost all my range of motion.\n\nMy feet still hurt a ton after activity, so that part did not change at all.\n\nI take celebrex, I use a couple neat very minimal braces. It is basically a thin, 1 inch wide strap that wraps under my arch, crosses over my ankle, and wraps around the achilles. It is very minimal so my feet feel supported, but not unstable after I take them off. \n\nI also go and get pedicures once a month, because the massage and heat therapy really helps.\n\nEdit: Found a pic of the brace, it is a Shock Doctor 844 ( I second swimming. Is not Curcumin an anticoagulant?  I have told my doctor about the use and they have not advised me to stop using it. I have moderate hemophilia so I am not sure about the impact on people with severe. It is anecdotal evidence but if I stop taking it for a day or two my ankles hurt far more. I am sure it is helping  It has great anti-inflammatory properties. No I do not get that feeling I use a 3m ankle wrap. \n\n\n\nYou may want to go to physio or get a low resistance theraband and look up some ankle exercises for stability.\n\nAlso prophylaxis helps. If you know you might do a long walk treating before hand goes a long way. I am not a doctor but am a believer that if you use strapping and rely on them, it will  make your joints and then muscles around them weaker which will result in more longer term pain and injury.\n\nSomething to consider... by all means use them if your hurting/helps with the pain, but do try to chop and change, walk with out one - to give your joint muscles the chance to  to strengthen naturally I got my ankle fused about 13 years ago. I was bone on bone at that point, and everything was agonizing.\n\nI have been told since I was a teenager that I would need to get my ankles fused. To my past self, this sounded horrible. I put off the fusion as long as I could. I only went to see a surgeon when I felt envy for the South African sprinter with no feet., since his ankles did not hurt(I am guessing).\n\nThe operation &amp; recovery was not so fun. However, on the other side of it, I saw almost immediately that I should have done it at least five years earlier. To avoid fusion I gave up time with my family and was sidelined frequently when there were things that I would have really liked to do.\n\nMy recommendation based on this experience is that fusion really does help a lot. The pain is gone and i do not miss so much stuff(except when I am feeling lazy). \n\nI know it is a hard pill to swallow, but the fusion might be a door opening rather than a door closing if you take my meaning. Bon Courage! Thank you for sharing your story here, how old were you when you fused your ankle? Did you notice any side effects in other joints after the fusion? I Heard it can affect arthrosis in other joints on the foot. How long did the whole OP and rehabilitation take all in all? Sorry for the number of questions here I am just very insecure at the moment :D Hey thanks for the answer! Could you send me a link for the exact product you are using? Glad to help.

Does it have any effect for you with the cream? I have heard that too, but I have not had any issue with it at all! I have not had issues with incresed bleeding with diclofennac but it can cause heart problems with chronic use. Do not ask me how I know. Hey fiddler! What is chronic use for you? Did you use it everyday? I just got the Creme and I think it helps a lot, but I will use it only when the joints are really inflamed (is it called like this? :D) Almost daily for several years now. Beginning of this year, ECG showed heart skipping beats etc. Totally threw away all the diclofennac after that. Switched to a menthol cream which seemed to do the job. Hey westmonster I DM\u2018d you for some individual questions! i am probably doing it wrong but I do not see any mail on reddit just sent a private message to /u/mostdopevogt I have had no cartilage in both my ankles for 3years and just got an ankle replacement for the right ankle (zimmer). This was after years of ortho  surgeons wanting to fuse my ankles. But I held off because I did not want my calves to atrophy and also more arthritic issues with other joints in the foot. I would say get some basketball boots or other boots that are ankle supportive. If you have no cartilage anti-inflammatory meds will not help. I was taking Celebrex/meloxicam for years which did zero for me. I take CBD oil which helps with taking the edge off the pain especially if walking for more than 15-30minutes.

Do we just wait and observe until we experience a bleed or something?  As a 3-4% moderate will he need regular infusions of factor and will it be a battle to stay covered?  I am certainly concerned with the costs and coverage and obviously his quality of life, but looks like a lot has changed in the recent decades.  (a relative of hers apparently died rather young in the 80s, but I believe that was a result of getting contaminated blood and ultimately getting AIDS).\n\nAny advice or words of wisdom is greatly appreciated.  We were also hoping to have another kid so he has a sibling to grow up with (hoping girl), but now I am morally conflicted to take that chance again.  Perhaps adoption would be best. I am a not a father, but have very similar hemophilia as your new son.  I would suggest getting in touch with your nearest htc.  They can help you figure out all the ins and outs of insurance and what to expect from a baby with this condition.  My htc is great, always willing to walk me through insurance claims and connecting me with companies that will pay the copay on my factor orders, thank god.\n\n  Circumcision is a personal choice, I was cut and that is when they determined I was a hemo, and can be done safely, but is not necessary.\n\nYour son is lucky, as a moderate hemo I have a good quality of life.  I have to infuse once or twice a month and am very active, running, weight lifting, working outdoors.  Last time I was tested my levels were 3-5%.  I do not need a port or have any fused joints.  It is the unlucky severe hemophiliacs that seem to really suffer, sorry bros.  Most people who know me would be shocked to know I have a bleeding disorder, and my close friends often forget.\n\nThere are great opportunities to meet others in this community through National hemo foundation and regional groups. I was lucky enough to attend the Paul Neman camps as a kid and those experiences changed my life.  Hemophilia has a shit ton of drawbacks but there are some positives and treatment is getting better every year. Do not forget, adversity builds character.  Good luck figuring all this out and pm me if you want to chat further about my experience.\n\n &gt; Is this accurate and recommended, I was surprised by it due to their potential inflammatory nature?\n\nYou need to get in contact with your nearest NHF/HFA chapter and (if you do not have one already) get set up with a hematologist, preferably one specializing in pediatrics. They will be able to guide you better than a normal doctor regarding most of these issues.\n\n&gt;our decision I guess and i am leaning towards no (on the circumcision) why take the risk of complication?\n\nI am severe and I was diagnosed as a result of my bris, which is a *great* story for parties. It is absolutely feasible if you want it done, even w/ moderate.\n\n&gt;Adverse reactions from vaccines makes me extremely nervous despite the claimed safety.\n\nDo not be a garbage person, vaccinate your kid.\n\n&gt;myself who while employed long term have no benefits or any insurance\n\nYou are going to need to figure out your insurance issues *tout suite* - again this is a question for your local chapter, who will have many years (if not many decades) of experience helping new parents get set up with whatever supplementary programs are available in your local state.\n\n&gt;So in addition to my concerns above, what is next? \n\nThese are all questions for your HTC/hematologist and chapter, but in general moderate is way less of an issue than severe. Even at 3% your son may not need to infuse unless it is in anticipation of strenuous physical activity such as sports - I would not let him play (American) football but he should be good for mostly everything else.\n\n&gt;I am certainly concerned with the costs and coverage and obviously his quality of life, but looks like a lot has changed in the recent decades.\n\nIt is not quite the difference between HIV care in the 80s/90s and HIV care now, but it is certainly a lot easier and safer than it was in the mid-80s. No reason a hemophiliac born in a first world country cannot have a 100% normal QoL and odds are there will be long-term gene therapy or other treatment coming down the pipeline by the time they hit puberty.\n\n&gt;We were also hoping to have another kid so he has a sibling to grow up with (hoping girl), but now I am morally conflicted to take that chance again. Perhaps adoption would be best.\n\nThat is a convo w/ your hematologist and whatever sort of doctor does IVF. Congrats on the son, as others have posted the best thing to do is find your nearest Hemophilia Treatment Center. They are equipped to handle the loads of info you will need. If you are near Indiana, the IHTC is amazing.  I have a six month old boy with severe hemophilia A. Similarly, I found out while pregnant that I am a carrier. \n\nMy boy has received Hep B and all vaccines at the regular schedule. My Dr. has recommended all shots be administered subcutaneously to reduce bleeding. He has not had any issues so far. He was not circumcised but boys with hemophilia can be with the right precautions. They did not do a heel prick for the PKUs, they instead drew blood intravenously to reduce possible bleeding. Have you met with a pediatric hematologist? They will explain what happens next and how to move forward with treatment. I have a nurse and social worker assigned to me that I can contact anytime there is an emergency or I have a question about an injury. The social worker helped us choose an insurance plan that would best cover our expenses. Get in contact with you regional hemophilia treatment center. \n\nAs for the next kid....We briefly consider PGS IVF but we have decided to wing it and just get pregnant naturally. You will come to your own conclusion, you have options and in the end it is up to you.  Get in contact with a Hemophilia Foundation in your area. They will help you find a Hemophilia Clinic appropriate for you and help with insurance. I live in Michigan and have Children's Special Healthcare and am fully insured for life with all Hemophilia factor treatments and hospitalizations I have had. My treatments are $50k each, but I do not have to worry about them because insurance pays them in full. There are cheaper alternatives, but I am on a new, stronger treatment for a target joint bleed.\n\nAs a Moderate/Severe Hemophiliac, I have never had an issue with shots nor are they something to worry about. I have been fully vaccinated with no problems over the years (I am 24).\n\nAs for concerns regarding your wife's relative dying from the transfusion, that is no longer a concern as modern day factor is 100% lab-made blood. It no longer comes from real blood. Plus he is being born into an amazing time for Hemophiliacs! There are trials going currently for a potential cure (might be temporary, might be permanant, only time will tell) and the new drugs we take are very safe and work very well.\n\nI recommend that once you do get a Hemophilia Clinic that you ask for a travel letter stating everything a doctor would need to know about your child's Hemophilia. Speeds things up a lot faster than having to explain it everytime and be questioned.\n\nIf you have any other questions, I will be sure to attempt to answer them! I do not have kids myself but have personally grown up with Hemophilia. My Grandpa has it, in his 70s and is still going today. He has had major surgeries on his knee, ankle and back, but this was due to the lack of quality factor they had back in the day. My cousin has it and works a semi truck driving job doing just fine with it.\n\nOne word of advice. If he has a bleed, especially if it is joint related, **Do Not** hold off on getting it taken care of. Nothing is more important than making sure to keep your joints and muscle in proper order for a comfortable life. One thing you might want to read up on is ( which can make treating hemophilia more challenging.\n\nThere is published study that seems to indicate there may be a way to reduce the chances of developing inhibitors: (\n\nThe big takeaway of the study can be found in this (\n\n&gt; Newly diagnosed individuals and their caregivers should consider the new data from the SIPPET study in the context of all the accumulated data on inhibitor formation in PUPs  and the pathogen safety risk/benefit of the two product classes and consider the following options:\n\na. Initiate therapy with a pdFVIII /VWF product in all PUPs.\n\nb. Initiate therapy with a rFVIII  product as previously recommended by MASAC (6).\n\nc. Initiate therapy with a newer rFVIII product. What product(s) and dose are you taking that cost $50k per treatment? Eloctate. When I was on Recombinate it was $1,600 each for a 3,000 unit dose. That lasted me around 12 hours of Factor levels. My Hemophilia Clinic switched me to Eloctate at 5,000 units. This stuff lasts 23-24 hours. They originally said it was in the $30ks but I keep getting the bills from my Infusion Center I go to and they vary around $50k so I am not entirely sure.\n\nBut I am surprised my insurance pays for this rather than cheaper alternatives considering I get weekly treatments now. Well remember too, sometimes uncircumcised men get injured for sexual activities and bleed. I think it is safer to have him circumcised. If the doctors know about the condition, they can do the circumcision on him safely.  Get involved with your Hemophilia Treatment Center and your local Hemophilia groups, especially if they have active parent groups.  Go on line to the NHF (  They have a couple of online assets that will be very helpful to you and your wife.  One is called \"Steps for Living\" and this is a series of things starting with babies and going through adulthood.  Really helpful stuff like recognizing bleeds, picking babysitters, etc.  The other one is for later in childhood.  Its called \"Playing It Safe\".  A great information source on sports and other activities that kids can do safely and ones they cannot.  Start reading this over the next year and develop hobbies in the green zone and your son will naturally follow your lead.\n\nYour vaccines can be sub cutaneous (under the skin).  This prompts a good discussion point about getting a hematologist IN a Hemophilia Treatment Center.  Hemophiliacs that are treated in an HTC both have fewer bleeds and a small, but statistically significant longer life expectancy. You need to factor him up.  There are some studies that suggest that early exposure to factor increases inhibitor risk so circs are more risk than they seem.  The baby is described as a moderate, so not as big of a risk as a severe.\n\nfactor is expensive and for a procedure that many see as cosmetic, it is not easy to justify. I go to IHTC, what do you like about it so much? Well Ive been to a few HTC and its really just flat out better. They do so much more than most. Indianapolis is also one of the best places for medical learning, thanks to IU.  There is so many services they offer that many do not. \n\nThey pay for my gas for visits, they have driven personally 2+ hrs to my house to help me with insurance paperwork, when my fridge broke the staff bought me a new fridge and drove it up,  they helped get me into college for free, they paid for my disability lawyer, they host men group meetings all around the state with cool activities, taken patients to Pacer and Colts games free.\n\nThe PT specialists have given me so much free wraps, braces, etc. When I have to see outside doctors they call and work with them on my hemophilia, instead of just handing me pain meds they actually worked with and trusted me for 2 yrs while we tried different ones, til we got a good combination that was fair. When I have ran out of factor when my insurance cut me they helped find me factor for 6 months for free. \n\nThey are always on top of my medical care, informing me of my options, helping me set stuff up, calling me at 2AM when I need help with a bleed. I still remember one time, I was leaving for vacation and my house was robbed the day before. My trip was prepaid so I couldnt cancel. One of the docs on their day off drove up to my house just to give me new factor and pain meds for my trip.\n\nI mean they just offer so many services from career counseling, mental health, help with really everything..\n\nThat is not to say I have not had an issue or two over my 34 yrs but overall they are far better than the other doctors and HTC I have been to. I have only been going there for about 2 years and I like it and all I just feel they can get a little over whelming with the comprehensive appointments and stuff like that. I agree though that they will go out of their way for you. That to me was a big plus when I switched from Riley (I live in Indy so all the IU stuff is right in my backyard)  Yes, it is tough for the appointments I agree, sadly though insurances are putting a lot of pressure on hemophilia doctors. Most ppl just do not get Hemophilia, they think it is just if you get cut you will bleed to death. So HTC are really having to log so much stuff now. I never used to do logs, but 2 yrs ago I had to start. The pharmacy cannot even fill my order now, they got to transfer me to a nurse or Medicaid and Medicare will not pay. \n\nThere is so much outside stuff making lives harder for ppl with hemophilia than they need to be. \n\nIHTC actually had an office at Riley when I was a kid, had a surgery there. I can see how it is different going from a place like Riley to IHTC. Riley is just great for kids honestly. Oh side note: If you ever need any advice on the place feel free to message me. Theres really so many things they will help with, even your utilities occasionally if they can. They have so many rude patients, that if you are polite and friendly, they will go out of their way for you.\n\n They have a new doc there Hardesty, he was a little rough and know it ally when he started a couple yrs ago but he is gotten better. When I started asking questions about future treatments/studies etc.. he would start kind of nerding out and now hes opened up a bit more towards me lol.\n\n He is actually going to try and run his own gene therapy trials soon.

Your home care company will have back packs or other devices.  Check with them.  For home use, I would store the factor in the refrigerator or freezer depending on the instructions for your factor product to give you the longest storage life.  The factor infusion equipment may be better stored in a stackable plastic drawer, but something lockable would be best as this keeps little hands out of the sharp port needles and this saves a trip to the ED. Oh my gosh I had not even CONSIDERED locking up the port needles. Thank you for your helpful reply! I also use stackable plastic drawers for all my supplies  and all factor gets stored in the fridge. I usually use a backpack when I travel because you do not want to put that stuff in your checked luggage. Good luck with your son, thankfully in this day and age he will have high quality of life despite the Hemophilia.  I break up my FVIII when it arrives and store it in a travel kit (provided by the manufacturer).  I find it easier to grab-and-go a travel kit when I need to infuse, rather than source each individual item. I also keep loose supplies in an 8-gallon Rubbermaid Action Packer. Hey, my son ( 7 months) also has Hem A severe, detected at birth so he is been on treatment since, it is  been a hard learning process. As for storage all supplies (needles, pads, sterile fields, etc) I keep them in stackable plastic containers, easy to clean and keep sterile. For the factor I keep it on a mini fridge with a humidity and temperature thermostat attached ( bought separately), always keep a month stock. \n\nFor travels it is a pain the ass, he has a catheter so the infusion it is not easy, I usually plan ahead to where I am traveling and find a nurse or clinic that knows the procedure, for the supplies just pack them in a small container, the factor in a travel cool container and you are set ( I am using Kogenate fs, lasts for 30 days below 24 C, after fridge) ask your doctor for a travel prescription. I use ambulance medication boxes, small devider and spots for it all. Also, you can always ask when ordering if u can change some things around. More of one less then another. In my family we always had a drawer, usually the largest, in the fridge dedicated to holding the factor. Then we a shelf in the hall closet that had all the random supplies you need for infusions in drawers.\n\nGranted we never needed ports, so you might just need two shelves or something like that.", "Standardized Ultrasound Guidelines Needed for Patients With Hemophilia, According to Expert Panel ", "Any Hemo brothers here that live in Iceland?

I have those in my hiker boots and they are rather amazing. Absolutely no padding though, the cadence insoles look rather nice. I am liking Hoku One One shoes - great cushioning has meant I did not need any insoles Thanks is for the advice, I will check them out! I have pretty much gotten to the point where regardless of the shoes, I am using inserts (dress, athletic, etc.). Makes that much of a difference that I can really tell by the EOD if I have not worn them. Even to the extent that I am wearing indoor shoes with them My first summer with barefoot shoes I would only wear them for a few hours at a time, but after a few years of use they became my standard daily wear. I never tried running, though running usually results in swelling regardless of shoe, I am more of a cyclist anyway. I found that my ankles would more easily recover from injury with improved muscle strength, but things came to a bit of a halt when I developed plantar fasciitis, so YMMV. This is a great thread. Finding what shoes work for me has made such a difference to my quality of life. For me it is Doc Marten's , I will not wear any other brand now, my ankle issues have substantially improved since having good, supportive shoes My HTC referred me to a prosthetics specialist. Luckily they were honest with me and told to try inserts before I paid them to make something. They recommended going to a higher end running store and talking to them about it. \n\nThey recommended the superfeet. The tennis shoes I got are designed for prolapsed arches so I do not have to use the inserts in those.\n\nIn the end it is whatever works best for you. Good call.

I did some research and it suggested that cooling your body might actually be bad for coagulation, and so im worried this therapy could actually worsen my joints. \n\nIf anyone has experience swimming in cold water or how cold temperatures affects coagulation it would be greatly appreciated. \nThanks I have not heard of this. I take cold showers and have not had a problem...granted I am not immersing myself in water. Have you tried adjusting your technique? Blood vessels contract (or shrink) in the cold, and blood is redirected towards your vital organs. Fun fact, muscle can last a good amount of time without oxygen. You shiver to generate body heat and if youre a naturally vascular individual, your veins disappear when you are cold. \n\nSo if you, say, have a bleed in your toe, and spend a lot of time in a cold environment, not enough blood is going to the bleed. Not enough blood, not enough factor (assuming you have dosed).

Have your hematologist contact your dentist.  Cool, thanks for the reply. Sounds like it is not a big deal as long as your dentist or other dr can reach the haematologist. I thought maybe minor surgeries were being delayed or postponed because non-haematologists were too afraid to treat.

He is not in network with my dental insurance, but paying a bit extra has been worth it. I understand some people cannot do that.

The neurosurgeons worked at the same hospital as the HTC and were comfortable with the situation.\n\nJust make sure everyone is aware of the hemophilia before any scheduled procedure and they have a treatment plan. If you feel uncomfortable with it then do not do it. Basically talk to your hematologist and the doctor/dentist before any procedure.\n\nAlso, if it is anything more than a dentist/minor procedure make sure the hospital that is doing it has a fair bit of factor on hand. You do not want to have a treatment plan and the hospital not have factor if you need it.

Accidentally forgot to prime butterfly needle with medicine, started to inject. Worried air in vein could be an issue. Can anyone help?  You need to inject a lot of air for it to be an issue.  Like 100 mL or so.  Small amounts of air your body can re-absorb.\n\nIn terms of who to call, do you have a primary healthcare provider for your hemophilia?  They often have 24 hr lines you can call. Does a specialty pharmacy provide your factor for you? They tend to have a nurse available by phone 24 hours a day. They may not be immediately available but can call back ASAP. I have done this more times than I would like to admit. If it is only a few cc\u2019s you will be fine. Although the gurgling sound as it goes up your arm can be unsettling, it would take far more air than what is in the butterfly tube to cause issues. My doctors said that, as a precaution, they rarely make tubes long enough to cause major embolism problems if you forget to prime once. I do not think you should worry, unless the syringe was filled with air too. Thank you all! I  have never primed with medicine. I have always drawn blood back in to the syringe, all the air bubbles float to the top.

I am a 24 years old male with severe  hemophilia A with &lt;1% factor VIII levels,after being on reddit for about 2 years and mainly visiting it for my hiccups encountered during playing Terraria (awesome game though!), I was only wondering today that if reddit also had a hemophilia sub-reddit ,in the vast expanses of reddit universe haha,turns out, not only it does but also had such helpful folks around too!!!

How does it compare with Benefix and Idelvion? I get a lot less bleeds on Alprolix. Maybe that is because i find a 10-day treatment cycle easier to adhere to than taking factor every three days? I think i have had one bleed in the past year on Alprolix, which is a record for me. My son has factor 9 deficiency and was on benefix and Alprolix.\n\nWe infused benefix 2500 units every second day and he was still getting breakthrough bleeding. We changed to Alprolix every 5 days and the bleeds were a lot less but he was still having breakthroughs. After a year of Alprolix we switched to Rebinyne. One year of Rebinyne once a week and not a single bleed that needed an extra infusion. Not a single hospital visit. Not a single ultrasound. He is way more active now than ever and the bleeds are completely subsided by this product.

Does anyone use the new hemlibra? What are your experiences? How long does it take to inject?\n\nThx This is not an answer to your question, but there will be a conference is Glasgow this May put on by the World Federation of Hemophilia. If you are able, you should come! It is a great opportunity to learn more about new medications and meet other bleeders. We have one patient on the med now.  So far, so good. Here is a tv news ( you might find interesting. You have an option to use it in Germany? Not yet bur i will probably be approved in a few weeks for bleeders with inhibitors. Its wonderful. It has changed our life from daily infusions into a port to a once a week subcutaneous shot. The one downside is my son is two and the medicine really burns so he does not handle this as well even though it is a lot easier than accessing his port everyday. Port did not hurt because of the numbing agent used so he would not feel the needle stick.  I have been on it for a year, AMA. Are not conferences like ~500 EUR a shot? Or actual hemophiliacs get a discount ? It is more expensive for physicians and pharmaceutical companies to attend. People with bleeding disorders are offered a cheaper ticket. I think it is around 225 EUR. Congratulations! I am glad it is working for you. Did you notice any difference in your joints or is it the same like before with regular factor therapy?  No more of the aches you get when your levels are at 0% and you know you need an infusion. No more rushing home when you turn your ankle a bit on a sidewalk. No more worrying about veins cooperating! \n\nEven when my ankles have come close to a bleed (such as, erm, as I write this), I know that with some intensive RICE they will be fine in a day without the need to call my doctor panicking about whether or not I should of use. I am curious about the amount of fluid you have to inject sub-q.  How many ml?  How does that feel? Around 0.85ml. I alternate between sides of my stomach; right side always leaves me a little queasy for a moment if I hit a weird spot. Still nothing like stabbing yourself with a butterfly! How high is your fviii level at minimum? Does this level vary the same amount as with the usual injection (after 30 min the highest level; after 24 hours half the amount etc.)? Thank you Wow, such a small amount. Today it was approved:  Here is the weird thing: your FVIII level does not actually go up. Hemlibra essentially works by skipping VIII and jump-starting the interaction between IX and X, which then causes the clotting process to continue.\n\nI believe one of the study reports said that Hemlibra users have the equivalent of a constant 10%. I have been on it for 24 months as a drug trial as it has not been approved in NZ/AU yet by Pharmac/PBS. I was not on prophylaxis previously. I have zero bleeds now. Injection as others have said is 1 subq a week at a rate of 1ml = 1kg of body weight. Previous to this I was on Factor7/FEIBA to stop bleeds over the years.", "Chiropractor adjustments Hey all, \n\nJust recently subbed and am a 24 severe type A. I was wondering if anyone has ever gotten an adjustment by a chiropractor. If so how it went! I recently got my first deep tissue massage and it was awesome but caused me to bleed a bit in my traps as expected.  Personally, I would be careful with chiropractic adjustments, mostly because there are documented cases of hemorrhagic stroke (even if the risk is pretty low) from adjustments which tore major arteries. A lot of times I see the benefit of chiropractic being increased blood flow, which of course is not always a benefit for us like it is for others. If you are looking for a chiropractic adjustment to help with pain, then I would say maybe trying something like a swedish or sports massage instead of deep tissue would be worth trying, though a sports massage may involve a bit more stretching than we should get. But I could just be squeamish about stretching right now because I tore my psoas doing yoga a couple weeks ago.\n\nThe best advice I can give of course is to contact your HTC's nurse coordinator or speak with your hematologist about it. Depending on your insurance carrier, a chiropractor may be covered where something like a masseuse would not be, but either way I would definitely still want to go through my HTC to get a referral instead of yelp. Chiropractors are not doctors, do not go to one. Get massages and do easy training exercises instead to try and get rid of your issues.  I am sorry but I exercise 4 times a week and am in good shape not for a hemophiliac but for anyone. I studied kinesiology as my undergrad too. It was a question relax lmao  I had a car wreck a few years ago and had some issues with my back and neck. My PCP wanted to refer me to get a deep tissue massage, but my hematologist recommended against it due to the bleeding risk. I ended up being referred to a physical therapist. I would always run something like that by your HTC. Even if they recommend against something like that they can usually recommend an alternative solution for your situation. Adults with hemophilia can drop 2-3 units of blood into a bleed on one side of the paraspinal muscles (psoas).  Tear a vessel and you could end up with a lot more problems.  I would go to your HTC's physical therapist and get some treatment and some exercises.   I cannot stress this enough.   I have gotten bleeds from going to spinalsnappers.

My main symptom is extremely heavy periods, we have tried 3 different contraceptive pills, norethisterone and tranexamic acid in the past. None have worked and a couple made things worse. About 5 months ago I got a mirena IUD, things felt better for a couple months but this months period has been one of the worst I have ever had. I pass big clots and fill pads every 2 hours even wearing a double pad. In the past I have went and got desmopressin from the hospital but this has done little for my periods even though it raises my VW levels, it really only helps with nose bleeds.\nDoes anyone have any urgent advice as I am really struggling on how to deal with this. Some people use humate P Hi love! I am a severe type 3 vWD gal myself and have had heavy periods too.\n\nMy heaviest cycles were pretty awful and tranexamic acid did not help me either. I was also offered the Mirena as well, but after talking to several women with vWD, they all said it was a bad choice. Most got worse bleeding or bled them out entirely. It is a very difficult choice to make as we are all different and bleed differently.\n\nPersonally, I have chosen to not have a period at all and I take oral contraception continually. I think I am currently on Marvelon 28 and I just skip the sugar pill. I have done this for almost 2 years.\n\nPlease check with your care team and see if you can talk to a gynecologist that understand bleeding disorders. Sometimes, low estrogen can increase bleeding as well, low thyroid too. These have all been issues I have had as well.\n\nDrink lots of water, take iron supplements with orange juice, do not take super hot showers, and please please please talk to your care team. Get your hemoglobin checked, and talk to gynecology about other options. Being anaemic really sucks, I can speak from experience. Hi there, thank you for your help!! I wish I had talked to someone with VWD who had the mirena before I got it but every doctor said they thought it was going to work and I just listened\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI am anemic too! I was told to double my dose of iron recently due to lower levels so hoping next time I get some bloods done that is higher. Someone had suggested before being able to take a contraceptive pill alongside having mirena and I think I might look into this. \nThank you\u2763\ufe0f something to always remember, doctors do not always have all the answers. Our conditions are unique and not every doctor has experience with women who bleed.\n\n I used to moderate a facebook group for folks with vWD. I would suggest looking them up. If they are run by anyone named HL, Rosa, Laura, or Emma, they are good ones. I asked about the mirena there and I got 100 answers from 100 different women with vWD, all with different severities. I think 10 of them had no problem, the rest had not so great experiences.\n\nI would suggest getting an ultrasound or other types of imaging done to make sure it is not just the bleeding disorder causing the heaving bleeding. Best to rule out as much as possible.\n\nI am always here if you want to chat :) I do not personally do well with only progesterone birth control. It makes my bleeding  very inconsistent, unpredictable, and occasionally it will go on forever. \nI typically do better on a combo estrogen/progesterone pill. I actually spent a couple years with an arm implant as well as taking yaz because the combo really helped me. But everyone responds differently. \n\nI had good luck with Amicar. It is a liquid medicine that tastes awful. But I have used it occasionally for periods. Worth a try maybe? They make amicar in pills. Just fyi I was in the same position as you with the Mirena but ended up having a lighter period but for about 3 weeks of the month every month. Tranexamic acid also did not help much. I am in a research study now comparing tranexamic acid and a new medicine. DM me if you want more info  about it. Thank you I will look into it! I am a VWD type 2 and suffered heavy periods since my period startet at age 12. I had a IUD and lost it due to very heavy periods, now tranexamic acid helps me, but there are other things I tried before, maybe some of them are worth to discuss with your docotors. Everyone is different, what works for one is not working for others. \n\n\\- Talk to a haematologist AND a gynaecologist. Best, the two doctors talk to each other about how to help you. My gynaecologist was unsure about my VWD and together with my haematologist she found a solution.\n\n\\- Use a menstrual cup. They have a scale, so you can track your blood loss. I sometimes use tampons and to find out how much ml they take I injected water from a tiny syringe with a scale until the tampon was full. So i keep track of the bleeding. This helped a lot when I talked to my doctors, because if you tell them \"I lost 400 ml last month due to my period\", they will take you more serious than if you say \"my period is heavy\". \n\n\\- Consider a different amount of medicine. In the beginning, I started to take tranexamic acid the second day of my period. It helped, but I still lost too much blood. I talked to my doctors, now I take it as soon as the bleeding starts and I am allowed to take even more pills than are usually advised. (4 days 3 x 2 pills a day, then 3 x 1 pill a day, 2 pills a day and 1 pill a day until the bleeding has stopped.) \n\n\\- I took the contraception pill continually, what worked for a while less or more. I had tiny bleedings, but it varied with the hormones used for the pill. I tried some different combinations and there were huge differences. \n\n\\- My haematologist informed me that before giving birth I will receive a blood transfusion where they will give me only the VDW-factor, not the blood. This may be something to discuss with your doctor, maybe this is something women can receive even without being pregnant. \n\nAnyway, good luck to you! Inform yourself and search, see a lot of doctors and never give up. There is definetly someone who will be able to help you.  (I saw 10 gynaecologists and 2 haematologist until they found out I had VDW (I was 28 at the diagnosis) and it took two more years to find the right treatment ...)

I am lucky because my mother also happened to be a nurse which did wonders for my treatment level as a child. Prescribed Advate 2k on phrophy but, I follow the \"aura\" method of bleed prevention as well. That is, infusing (I usually do 100%. 4k units according to my docs) when you feel a bleed coming on. As does most every other severe hemophiliac that I have talked to in private. \n\nI was diagnosed after biting my tongue as a baby. Had to wear that fun helmet thing for a few years as a kid. I hope you guys know what I am talking about. My earliest memory of really knowing there was something weird about me was having one of those hang out lines. I do not know what possessed them to give that to a child. Either way, it got infected and went septic like superbleeder. Was on antibiotic drips for a while. After that I went through a series of three mediports. The last one being in for about 8 years. Got rid of that and started learning how to infuse with butterflies. My target joints are my left elbow and ankles. I have lost around 15% of motion in my left elbow. As far as close calls relating to the disease I have not had any major ones, luckily. I have only been to one national convention as a 12 year old. That was at Disney World in 2002 or 3, I think. Also went to Hemophilia summer camp a few years.

Hemophilia B is the only bleeding disorder connected to the European royal families and many people who are not connected to the royal family also have Hemophilia B. \n\nHowever The fact that you were born with two X-Chromosomes makes it significantly less likely that you have Hemophilia as generally having a nonaffected X chromosome would only make you a carrier, and the likelihood of two mutated X-Chromosomes is near impossible. In your situation I would look into being tested for Von Willebrand disease, low platelet count, or platelet disfunction as the most likely causes.\n\nPLEASE NOTE I am not a healthcare professional. Almost all that I know comes from my own experiences talking to nurses and doctors about my Hemophilia A, and by talking to other members of the bleeding disorder community where I live. If you have been tested for Ehlers danlos there is a lot of people with both it and Von  Willebrand\u2019s disease. (I am mixed race and female, I have both). My EDS makes some of my VWd symptoms worse and the VWd makes some of my EDS worse. So that is potentially an answer for you. Just a correction here. Women can have hemophilia with only one mutated X if they have skewed lyonization/ x-inactivation. This happened to me and many others I know. Women are more likely to have mild hemophilia. Thank you for the correction, being male I am significantly less exposed to this information. Absolutely correct.  My mother was in reality a mild hemophiliac and almost died from bleeding episodes a couple of time in her early  life, like when she had her tonsels taken out. It wasnt until after my birth she finally got the proper treatment/care. To add to the other top comments, Hemophilia also has a large amount of mutations. Around ~~10%~~ 30% seem to have it from a mutation instead of inheriting it.\n\nIt looks like it is not likely you have Hemo, but there are many other disorders that can cause bleeding. If you are taking T, that can also cause more bleeding.\n\nPersonally, I do not have too much of a problem with bleeding from small cuts.

It may be the newer long term data which was reviewed this week at WFH which shows it is not sustaining the initial year 1 levels. Some analysts are no longer sure of insurances wanting to pay for a therapy that may dissipate in time.Even if levels in the 30s are still an awesome feat. some may ask what the cost of that compared to hemlibra would be etc. what is exciting for hemophilia does not translate fully to the finance world. Makes sense I suppose. BioMarin has a PDUFA date of August 21, which means a gene therapy for hemophilia A may be approved in 2 months in the US (crazy!!).

Not only could it affect the elbows, but it can also affect the joints in your hands, so be aware of that as well.  I am relatively mild and get treated only as needed, but could not do bag work very long. This is mostly because of what a previous bleed in my shoulder left behind, though.\n\nCertainly if you are going to do this, then you will need to make certain your technique is perfect, and that you have your hands wrapped well and a good pair of gloves. For me, I would be less concerned with my elbows than my shoulders and wrists, along with stuff like jammed fingers.\n\nI have a good relationship with a physical therapist who knows my limits well and how willing I am to push them, so if you have got anyone like that I am sure they can help or recommend someone else who can.   \n\nThese bags are not as bad on the joints as traditional bags.

However his mother claimed their Hospital (NewCastle UK I think) is researching a link between two and I read online Doctors saying it is far more common in Haemophilliacs .\n\nAre their any other ADHD Haemophilliacs on here and does anyone know about the possible link between the two ? I could not find any studies on it just Doctors giving Anacdotes .  I have got both... have never thought about a link between the two. I have got hemophilia and ADD myself but I have never heard of any link between the two before. What would the mechanism be? ADD is a relatively common diagnosis; I would expect there to be some overlap between it and hemophilia simply by chance.  I do not know that is what I am trying to find out. My Mum told me, another guys mum told her that her sons Doctor told them there are way higher rates among haemophilliacs and they are researching it.\n\nHowever I could find no studies to back it up. Shit like this just annoys me, the not knowing and needing to know haha. As you can see it was a long game of chinease whispers though, could be total shite. Every boy out there who goes to a doctor because they are having a tough time in the world is ADD.\n\nIf you are all that, and you have lots of energy, you are ADHD As someone who was medicated early for ADHD I' never had to deal with the \"high\" from it.

She argues that unlike me she is \"normal\" and she will not give the disease to her children and I am going like AaJsjskBsanLjdkanKan YOU ARE NOT \"NORMAL\", YOU KNOW YOU HAVE HEMOPHILIA YOU HAVE HAD TO GET FXIII FOR GOD'S SAKE.\nbut she just will not listen because she is too scared to admit it, and, worst of all, I do not think she has the patience to deal with all the paperwork to have a healthy hemophiliac, I am just hoping with all my being that he is not a bleeder, I do not want to see my nephew suffer, he is getting his test tomorrow, please world, let him have just a little bit more luck than me. He is lucky to have an uncle with your knowledge and concern if it turns out he does have hemophilia. And your sister is dealing with a lot of emotions as a pregnant woman. Hopefully she will surprise you. All the best. \ud83d\udc9e My mother apparently kept her family's history of hemophilia a secret from my father when I was born.  The doctors figured it out within a few weeks but because she did not say anything, my Dad and his family had to start from scratch back in the 70s.  My \"mother\" was not in the picture for very long after everyone figured out her deceit but luckily I had an Aunt who was relentless in tracking down the best available care and updated treatment options.  It was not ideal but things worked out about on par with other bleeders of my generation.  You cannot know how things will work out but you and your mother seem to have a lot of information to share if the situation calls for your expertise.  I suppose I can understand denial, even if it is not healthy but we all cope with life in our own ways.  You are part of her support system, just be ready to help if needed. My mom had two incredibly gruelling births, partly because of her Vwd. My aunt was her mid-wife for both, and after my sister was born she told her directly to \"Never have another vaginal birth, ever again\" because my mom almost bled out on both occasions. We did not find out about the VwD being a thing for another 15 years, though, but it would have been good do my mom to have had in hindsight.\n\nFor things like birth, it can be a huge ordeal for the body that can kill you if you do not take the appropriate precautions. Do you think mentioning it to her spouse/the baby's dad might help win her over? How did the birth go? With dropping factor levels did she need factor to keep herself safe? I know many women like her with mild Hemophilia who need factor too. Mild hemophilia is anything under 50%.\n\nSome of us milds even need prophy. So glad doctors are learning more about how to protect our women.\n\nIt could be her lower levels were her hormones dropping before birth...\n\nHow are she and the baby doing? It went fantastic but my mom's bleeding pattern is being ok for a week after birth and then go full bleed. Before she knew about hemophilia, she just thought she was weak, but due to this we are not completely relaxed yet.\n\nHer levels are probably 70% - 80% right know but her blood test does not arrive until tomorrow.\n\nThe baby\u2026 he seems to be ok but he had problems clotting some blood after he was separated from his cord and after he had an injection. That is no good sign but does not mean that he has hemophilia for sure, we are waiting for the results.\n\nOur hematologist is an angel tho, she has already told us that she will take care of him if he does has hemophilia, so that is good Great!

I woke up about a week and a half ago with some pain there. Not being that out of the ordinary, I infused and moved on with my day. Instead of getting better though its gotten worse since then. At first I was having trouble opening jars, then lifting things, and now I am at the point where it hurts to move at all. \n\nI have had arthritis in it for a long time so that was the main culprit after I realized it was not a bleed. But the fact that it is getting worse tells me that is probably not it. I considered that a chunk might have broken off the inside and is floating around in there, but the crepitus (crackling) is not any worse than it was and it is not hanging up my movement at all like that issue has in some of my other joints. It feels a lot like a bad bleed, but my range of movement is as good as normal, so there does not seem to be much swelling inside the joint.\n\nMy mom mentioned that sometimes if you sleep with your arm folded against your chest it can irritate something or other and cause pain. I have had that happen in the past and it has always gone away after a few days. So the worsening condition makes me think it is not that either. The only option I can think of that I have not ruled out is tendonitis. I do not have any experience with that though so I am not sure what it feels like.\n\nI am going to see my HTC soon if this does not resolve itself, but I figured I would ask you guys first. Any thoughts? My right elbow hurts from time to time. Particular movements cause it to hurt (reaching across my body, opening doors, etc.). So what I did was make a note with my Hematologist and prophy as usual. I noticed that it would only hurt around the colder months, but I started doing 10-15 push ups a day to keep it moving, and it has certainly helped. It could still be arthritis.  I would keep treating to make sure you are not constantly rebleeding.  I think you will like need an xray to tell for sure what is going on.  Osteoarthritis can cause swelling and pain on its own even without bleeding. \n\nI have a really bad elbow, have had multiple surgeries, it is now at the point that there is no joint.  When I bleed it keeps bleeding into the surrounding tissue.  I did not lose too much range but lost all strength and it hurt.  It was so bad that if I did not treat every 36 hrs it would rebleed. Fortunately surgery fixed it.  It was a bone spur which also could be your problem, that was slicing my muscle everytime I moved.\n Try to ice it and not move it until you can get into see your HTC. I have A severe. I have only had a few elbow bleeds, but I have had bursitis in my right elbow and tendonitis in my left. Both feel like bleeds and fit your description.  When I started using Hemlibra the tendonitis appeared (maybe because of the arthralgia side effect from Hemlibra, or maybe because I was more active and the increase in activity caused some wear). Now I am feeling the bursitis coming back and it hurts like a bleed but is not  getting worse like a bleed would. I bet you are dealing with something like that. I went to PT and worked on exercises that improved my posture and took some of the tension off of the tendons that cause elbow pain. It helped tremendously. My left elbow tendonitis went away completely. I might do similar exercises for the bursitis in my left elbow. People without hemophilia have these issues too, so it is not always due to bleeding. My left elbow has become a target joint and I went on Hemlibra because of it. It has helped tremendously, but during the winter months it aches a lot more. Plus before big storms (snowstorms, high pressure thunderstorms, etc.). But I only usually get 2 spontaneous bleeds per year at the moment. You had arthritis and you kept working out? I am asking because I am 18 and was really into calisthenics but since January my elbow started hurting and I cannot straighten it up.

It feels like the pace is quickening.  I think I have been hearing that gene therapy for hemophilia was '2-3 years away' for the past 20 years!  It is exciting these trials are actually happening.\n\nUnfortunately, during screening for a gene therapy trial I just found out I have antibodies to the AAV5 vector all of the recent good news has been about.  I got the call 20 minutes before posting this.  So that is a bummer.  I was really looking forward to participating in a trial here in the US.  But other trials are coming online, and new vectors and therapies are right around the corner.  I am optimistic something will become available in the next few years.

I actually did not do this trial but one of the authors is my hemophilia specialist and I may end up doing the same trial next year. I can answer most questions :) My hematologist is one of the authors of this study. It is as amazing as it seems :) Any improvements? How can I apply for the trial? First hand she told me a couple of participants were reporting 50% factor even after a year without injections!\n\nI am not sure about applying, ask your HTC. That is great and all, but since late 1990s we have been told a cure is 5-10 years away. And since that time, there is been 5-10 sure fire \"findings\" lauded in the press, just like this one, every...single...year. So maybe this is finally it, or maybe it is one of the dozens and dozens and dozens that drift away into nothing. Either way, I will not believe it until it is in my hands, and like the article says, \"There is a wide variation of results that cannot be explained.\" Meaning it works on some or possibly not at all, or maybe a just a little. \n\n So now I need to update my mantra that I say 5-10 times a year when articles like this come out, \"I will believe it when I am taking it, and my texts come back that I am cured.\" The approach used in the article you linked to is not anything like what is being used in the OP's article.  The 2001 trial involved nonviral gene transfer of skin cells *in vitro* which were then implanted in the body.  The recent trials involve viral gene transfer into hepatocytes *in  vivo* via a single infusion by vein.  ( Shit since the *early* 90s we were promised that. And y\u2019know what? It is here. I am on a weekly subq shot, I believe the sub moderator is on a gene therapy trial. The future is now, do not be a wet blanket about it. I understand that. I was not talking about a specific approach, only that we found a safe, effective gene therapy solution as early as 2000, but it never came to market. I think the problem was that any increase in FVIII activity they observed ( I got 6 months of effect from it where I needed very few infusions. My uncle was more like 8-10 months. Not bad from a Phase 1 safety study. It never got to Phase 2. I am actually not sure what my patient number was in the study. I know I got the larger dose of 400m and my uncle got the lower dose of 100m. Interesting.  Have you considered trying to get into one of the current FVIII gene therapy trials? Do you mean that with a single 400iu shot, your Factor level was raised to normal for 6 months?  Not 400iu... 400 million modified cells producing FVIII.\nAlso, not normal levels, but enough to stave off most bleeds. I would love to, but it does not seem like anyone is recruiting in the northeast US. ( just updated their list of study sites last week.  \n\n( which also reported early FVIII results this month may also be worth a look.\n\nAlso, I think most studies reimburse for travel.  So if you are willing to travel I would not expect it to be much of a problem. The Spark one looks interesting, thanks! I am not a wet blanket, I am a flat out realist. These press releases are just to drum up more money for their \"findings\". None of these are close to cures. Every time one of these comes out, people actually think it is a real cure, and their hopes get up. Then, it fades out of existence, blows up spectacularly, or will takes years to get FDA approval.\n\n And taking something that increases whatever missing factor for a little bit longer than normal then it goes back to zero is not a cure. A cure is never taking anything again and you are factor levels are at \"normal\" levels without ever having to take anything else again. And like I said, since these press releases are money grabs, and are not actual cures, I will believe it is an ACTUAL cure when it is in my hands and my results come back that it worked....not a second before hand.\n\nYes, in the 40+ years of being a hemophiliac, it is been night and day. I have survived the AIDS crisis. I saw dozens of my friends slowly die. It no longer takes 30+ minutes just to mix 30+cc's every dose. It is no longer a dice roll of getting HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis or an inhibitor. Factor went from coming from human blood, then hamster cells. But, a new press release about a new finding every month for 25+ years, you start to weed out the BS. A cure means you are actually 100% cured and everyone else is cured. Not, one guy got cured and everyone else did not and the researchers have no clue why and the product might not even make the market.

When I needed a shot, I just went to the nurse and joked with the nurse \"Hey, I need to shoot up, I need my fix\" (dumb joke, but w/e we were having fun) and just gave myself a shot.

Only time I had an issue was when there was a substitute nurse for one day, I ended up getting the principal to come into the nurse's office so he can clear things up.\n\nIt is been a while so I do not quite remember exactly what the note said, but I think it said something along the lines of \"it is essential that sars911's medicine is accessible to him at all times, just in case anything happens in school. sars911 is trained and able to self-infuse\". etc etc etc....\n\n I think this advice is solid. I grew up in New York and definitely kept factor at the nurses office and always self infused. It sounds to me like they are mistaken. Sometimes things like this come from a lack of understanding of hemophilia. I have had some success having my doctor or the nurses from the hemotology dept contact people directly to explain. Often people can be more understanding with all of the facts. That is weird? In my 504 I am able to infuse at my school? Lived in PA, was never an issue for me to self-administer, always just stopped by the nurse's office before a soccer game or whatev.\n\nSounds like you have a lazy nurse. Bring in your chapter and let them clean up the mess. My son started self administering when he was in 6th grade. He had been I fussing since he was 5 but at school was a different story. It is all about your school board policy. Ours was old and was for a hemo b student. Nothing was applicable. I filed a motion to change the policy. Got my HTC on board and the district policy was changed. Nothing illegal.  Definitely get a doctor\u2019s note saying he can self-infuse at minimum. I would take that to the other school administrators and try to educate them a bit about hemophilia in general. They likely do not know anything about hemophilia or understand how important it is to infuse quickly if he gets injured. I would not go to lawyers unless they continue to refuse to let your son have access to necessary medical treatment.\n\nI would draw parallels to diabetes, asthma, and allergies. They would not prevent a diabetic from giving themselves insulin, an asthmatic from using an emergency inhaler, or someone using an Epi-Pen on themselves. Accidents happen at school. My brother got a small concussion in gym class in middle school. Anyone can trip and twist their ankles. I had to take a couple of doses at school after I had a surgery. \n\nUnless they have a trained phlebotomist on staff, they do not have someone qualified to infuse. Kids\u2019 veins are hard to hit. I would not trust a school nurse to be trained and in good practice to hit my veins if needed. And I know my veins better than anyone. I know which ones move, which ones look nice but are too small to hit. I know what angle to attack from. My veins are tricky, a stranger is likely to bruise one up. That just puts more stress on my other veins as I have to hit them more often, especially if I have a bleed. It is a big liability on the school if they do it and screw up. If you do it, they are not at fault if something happens. Sorry but that is fucken retarded beyond all means... if I were you I would tell them they have the right to sodimise themselves. While I was in highschool I was encouraged to do my injections in front of everyone and talk about it... I loved doing it and only ever needed to self administer once and even then there was no quarrel over that. Get a 504 and put self administration in the plan.  Send me a private message if you want... former school administrator here.  They cannot deny access to meds or deny your effective treatment plan.", "I have never met another hemophiliac. It is bothered me for a while now. I am going on my eighth year of being diagnosed, and I am nervous just typing this now. I make jokes about having hemophilia constantly, but to me, it is normal. I actually made a reddit account for the sole purpose of encountering other hemos (Is this what we call ourselves? It is what I say, I do not know if it is offensive, or what) I know I have been lucky, but I have never really had the opportunity to talk to anyone else. My grandfather had hemophilia, but the Navy 'cured' him just in time for WWII, and he passed before I was aware of what it was, so I have never really gotten to talk to anyone who knew what I was talking about. But, if you took the time to read this, thanks. I would like to talk to you.", "Fundoplication/Major Abdominal/Bariatric Surgery in Severe Hemophilia Hi all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a severe Hemophiliac (Type A) and am scheduled to have a modified fundoplication (anti-reflux surgery) next month. My Hematologist and surgeon do not seem concerned despite zero historical evidence of a Hemophiliac undergoing the procedure successfully. The only one I could find was a emergency operation on a severe Type A in the 80s which proved fatal 63 days later. \n\nMy Hematologist is a bit hazy (very disconcerting) and believes that she vaguely remembers overseeing a similar procedure... We reached out to other major Hematology clinics around the country and no provider could recall a fundoplication being performed. \n\nThe planned Hemostasis regimen is demanding (continuous IV) and other surgeons pulled out due to this. \n\nHas anyone undergone similar abdominal operations successfully? If so, were there complications? What was the recovery like? \n\nI am 26yo btw if that makes a difference in recovery (provided I survive). Seems like the common complication is bleeding which for us is always the main concern. I underwent Arthroscopic Ankle Arthrodesis which is Ankle fusion which is nothing compared to an abdominal procedure but I support the success of surgeries nowadays for us hemophiliacs. Throughout the entire recovery, I was on prophy, every 48 hours I would take Factor and it definitely did speed up recovery. What I did was I found a specialist surgeon who has done this procedure and has great feedback and everything turned out fine by god\u2019s grace. Get more opinions from other surgeons who focus on abdominal only, not hematologists. Your hematologist is only concerned regarding the bleeding and you should be fine if both doc and hematologist are not the least bit of worried. Morbidity is less than 1% for your procedure so you do not have to worry if that is a concern. You may have gas and other GERD symptoms. The only real worry is you not giving infusions on time which will definitely slow the recovery process. Good luck. I have not had stomach surgery but I have had others and I was instructed to take factor 30 minutes before the surgery and every 12 hours for the first couple days if I remember correctly. The surgeons always said that I bled less than the average person lol. If you have enough factor you should prob be fine, but I am no doctor so I do recommend maybe trying to call other HTCs for more info You probably mean mortality as the morbidity ranges from 10-60%. Dissecting through the diaphragm up to the heart is always a recipe for disaster in a Hemophiliac. Apparently the serosa is inherently thrombolytic? Some papers from Germany discuss using antifibrinolytics during the operation then heparin after day 4. Problem is: I used aminocaproic acid during my wisdom teeth extraction and it resulted in a \"wet clot\" aka hypercoagulation in a socket that had to be removed. NBD in the mouth but could be fatal in the mediastinum. Frankly, I would rather be more on the bleeding side than the clotting since embolisms are risk as are pseudotumors. \n\nSaw some posts from other Hemophiliacs who had multiple fasciotomies that I assume were embolism related. Do not mess around with FVIII. If some incompetent nurse administers too much while I am out on drugs... anything that is involved penetrating the peritoneum? I am not sure what that is so probably not haha I had emergency laparotomy about 15 years ago (severe VWD) they just stuffed me full of factor and kept track of my levels. Had pretty impressive bruising but otherwise fine. \nSo long as they correct your FVIII levels &amp; monitor them - should not be an issue. Sounds good. Thanks for the input. I am borderline VWD as well (slightly above 40% threshold) so we decided to use human derived Factor VIII with VWF to hopefully improve my healing. I hate the idea of using plasma derived since I have always been on recombinant TC derived factors; however, hopefully it will confer an advantage. Did you have any issues with impaired healing despite factor replacement? Not massively, I heal a bit slower anyway but my wound healed nicely. I had a little haematoma at the top of the wound, but it did not make much difference in the overall process. Also I had been bleeding internally badly beforehand - so I was not in the best shape going into the operation - having a planned surgery is much easier. \n\nMainly post op I was tired and sore! As a nurse with hemophilia who has given factor to a patient before, I can assure you that the risk of \u201can incompetent nurse\u201d giving you too much factor while you are hopped up on narcotics is basically nil. They treat factor like a blood product in most hospitals and it is subject to as much scrutiny as a unit of blood or platelets would and is sometimes even dispensed by the facilities\u2019s blood bank. \n\nGood luck on your surgery though, sending positive thoughts your way. Do you know how much Factor sells for? I have heard it being compared to the price of gold. It is not something that a nurse can easily get more of and give you even if she wanted to.", "Roche announces positive interim results for emicizumab in phase III study of children with haemophilia A ", "When would be here?

I had a swelling and I went and got my Factor IX 3 days later from the initial swelling date. It is been 5 days but the swelling has stayed the same in size. The doctor says I might need to get another infusion, but I am not sure if the swelling is just the result from the injury (ankle sprain) and whether it is not hemophilia related, and if it was, should not the first infusion fix it? I also had swelling in my thumb at the time, so I am not sure if I need multiple infusions for 2 injuries at the same time.\n\nI know it is best to just speak with my HTC or care providers, but any insights much appreciated! Where are you from? If you have good treatment facilities, you should have immediately infused. Infusing after 3/4 days is not good enough, there is blood build up in that region which needs to subside and the bigger the bleed the more time it will take to heal. It might take weeks to fully subside. So best advice is always to immediately infuse after any knid of injury no matter how small.\n\nPS: HTC is where you should get you advice from though, they know your condition best. Take factor immediately upon injury and ice and rest to further reduce inflammation. Because the infusion happened a few days after the internal bleed, it will take longer to heal. Thank you! Yeah that is my bad, I was worried about the costs but I should have just gone there asap. Do you know if it is ever necessary to infuse a 2nd time tho? Appreciate it, thank you! Do you think I should infuse once again tho? It is not up to me to decide that but from the knowledge my Hematologist has provided me throughout my life so far, I am 90% positive you will have to give infusion based on the half-life of the factor. Only your Hematologist can tell you when that half-life is for yourself. Please contact them asap. I have come from ankle swellings to being a cripple to getting ankle arthroscopy for the subtalar joint to being pain free. Word of advice that I highly recommend you follow: do NOT slack on giving infusions at the right time. You will regret it later. &gt; Do you know if it is ever necessary to infuse a 2nd time tho\n\nYep. General rule with my factor IX (BeneFIX) is to treat another smaller dose if it is not 80 percent better within 2-3 days. I have had a tonne of bleeds that require a second dose, but please check with your HTC. I was always told if the bleed is not treated within 3 hours it can cause damage.  the longer I would wait to treat the more doses I needed to stop the bleed. This depends on how severe the initial bleed was and what your factor  IX level is. mine is less than 1%. So I am considered severe and Have been on prophy for last 6 years. I treat 2 times a week. I have maybe 2 or 3 bleeds a year. But used to have a bleed every 2 to 3 weeks. Thanks for the insight, appreciate it! So sorry to hear that, hope it is all good right now! And thank you for the advice! I am finally able to do my daily activities without much pain at all (1/10). Life is finally enjoyable.

I really want to fight! Not like street fight lol but I want to box or do a martial art, any martial art that is a little less high risk then others? I do not want to have to infuse every time.  Seems like a really bad idea! I am mild FVIII (~12%), and I got away with playing baseball, basketball, and other low-contact sports. Martial arts is all about defeating an opponent either with strikes, usually to the head, or submissions which put great stress on joints, muscles, and tendons. You want to minimize all of those things as a hemophiliac. I imagine you would be fine to train martial arts, but it would be very reckless to do any real sparring. From one mild hemo to another, you might think you are fine at 15 but when you are 32 like me, little injuries catch up to you. I am a patient with Severe A, less than 1%. I have trained BJJ, Muy Thai and Krav Maga. \n\nGet after it and know your limits. There are safe ways for everyone to train. When your body tells you to rest, rest. Make sure you stretch and eat healthy, and most importantly dose when you need to dose. Martial arts are, for the most part, high risk no matter what. Decide what you want to learn and get going! You could check out cardio boxing to start (like TITLE boxing club or I Love Kickboxing). They are full no contact. It might give you the option to learn techniques and get the workout without the high risk. However, still be careful on the heavy bag. Elbows, knees, shins, and forearms can still all get pretty bad bruising. Talk with your doctor before starting anything! Also, talk with the instructors at the gym you choose, they can help you get appropriate gear. Things like shin pads will help reduce bruising. Feel free to PM me with questions! ( had a record of 12-2-1 until he confessed that he was a Hemophiliac and was forced to retire from MMA.   It can be done, but probably not on a professional level or even in competition (unless you do not tell anyone, apparently) Holy shit :D I would also comment that since you are young you should definitely follow your prophy schedule. I didnt and let bleeds come on and then when they did I would delay infusing because I hated infusing. Now my target joints are shot and it is not fun dealing with. Keep up your prophy, know your limits and live your life the way you want to. Thank you for posting this! According to wiki he has Factor XIII. As someone who also has factor XIII and is dating an MMA fighter this was super interesting. I have done boxing training as it worked wonders for my fitness, made me feel more confident and gave me goals to work towards.\n\nAs a severe Haem B (Factor IX) I would never consider stepping in a ring to fight, nor would I if was mild and probably not even if \"normal\"... the risk of severe head injury does not seem worth it in my opinion. \n\nThere are literally hundreds of other sports to choose from that carry significantly less risk, so do not narrow down your options so young. I wish I would not fixated so heavily on football (soccer for you yanks here) when I was younger and tried my hand at more unique sports.\n\nSide note, Tai Chi might be an interesting route to explore, though it does not really involve \"fighting\" it is considered a martial art. I think there is a chap in American with Severe B who is a qualified instructor and teaches at some haemophilia events.  I believe his name is Rick Starks. Might be worth a google to see if you can get in touch with him and ask for some advice around martial arts.\n\nAll the best and stay safe Did they test Paddy to see if he had elevated levels of other factors? The devil is in the details. There is also Qi Gong which totally does not involve fighting and is commonly done as exercise. Im severe A, less than 1% and just got the red-black belt on tae kwon do, the more importante thing is to follow your dose schedule, get to know your limits and keep going. In my case, if I stop a couple of days, the nex time that I exercice my whole body hurts, and im not talking about muscles xD.\nSorry for the english, spanish speaker and the mobile keeps translating every single word FeelsBadMan. You could also try Aikido or TaiChi \u2014 both styles involve less contact fighting, but still very active and fun martial arts.

Just wanted to know your opinion,thanks in advance. Doctors speak a lot of nonsense. Do not pay a lot of attention. I have been hitting gym for 5 years now. First 3 years at a real gym, since  past 2 years now at home. I have changed my physic a lot. I can lift weights like a normal person and even more sometimes. The only thing you have to work on is patience and doing it really slow. Be consistent and make sure to rest. Rest is really important and sleep as much as you can. You will actually notice your bleeding frequency decreasing. It will make your joints only stronger and better to resist bleeding. I have Hemophilia A for Severe. I feel amazing after every workout. I wish you good luck! Be careful! I have been lifting regularly for about a decade. My bleeds that I am greater than 50% sure were related to my routine were a shoulder bleed I think I got from pull-ups that I did every day, which I have since cut out completely, and a soas bleed (but third time in that one) from doing HIIT yoga aerobics which I switched out for a recumbent bike. Otherwise no issues in that time. As part of the therapy specific to my soas I do squats and deadlifts three times a week and I increase the weights when I feel like I am ready to - if the form is good you should be fine. It really depends on a number of factors.. \n\nSeverity of hemophilia, the type of treatment you take, and the kind of lifting you are doing, treadmills are not really considered that great bc they are high impact, and my doctor always recommends exercise bike over it. \n\nI am severe factor A and have fucked up plenty of my joints. Im older though, and treatments sucked in my youth when I was lifting. With newer treatments, as long as you are careful, you should be ok. \n\nDo try to be low impact, lift on days you infuse if you are severe and on profy, go slow in your moves, do not increase weight by a ton, always small increments. It takes longer, but lower weights and higher reps is the safest route if you are severe. \n\nIf you have got a trainer, and you have made them aware of your condition and they are guiding you, and you are infusing, resting, and ice when needed, you should be alright. You expect some occasional issues obviously, but not as many as you would get from being out of shape. I do not know of any difference in joint damage from a normal person who lifts weights. The big difference you will see is the increase in factor usage compared to a sedentary lifestyle with no weightlifting. In my experience, hemophilia lifestyles are a lot like different models of cars. Weightlifters are like sports cars or large trucks, they burn a lot of gas (aka factor). Non weightlifters are like hybrid cars that just sip the minimal amount of gas. I have always felt that having a strong and toned body improves your resistance to injury and that probably offsets a bit of factor consumption, but you will be infusing more to repair muscle tissue that would not normally need repaired if you were not lifting weights. All forms of activity and exercise seem to increase my factor usage, but the health benefits of maintaining a healthy body are worth the extra factor usage. Aside from the increase in factor use, I do not know that I have had any extra joint damage compared to a non-hemophiliac weightlifter. My doctor explicitly told me that I should be lifting weights. Maybe not super super heavy weight but moderate weight with high reps. Muscle around the joint can protect the joint (according to my hematologists) \nMy HTC has a physical therapist that helped me set up a safe plan for me There was a severe hemophiliac weight lifter who said he never had bleeds anymore because he was so fit. He died a while back from unrelated stuff. He was pretty well known in the hemophilia community. Weight lifting is a good idea if you can start slow enough to make progress and not get set back by bleeds. I have not had too much luck with it because it is hard to not push myself too hard and get a bleed, then the recovery time stopped any gains I would have made. So I stick to swimming and biking and yoga. But now that I am on hemlibra I am able to make more progress with exercising, so maybe I will get there. I am in pretty good shape tho for a 44 yr old sever hemophiliac. I have been lifting weights for about 10 years now and have never had any hemophilia related injuries due to weight lifting. I personally think weight lifting is a great way to strengthen your muscles to protect joints. I would say to make sure you stretch regularly before lifting and focus on form, not the amount of weight you would like to workout with. Type 2 hemophilia (factor 9 - 1.8%) here, I have been regularly since last 4-5 years and I have had no issues except for one psoas bleed two months ago when imI was following a HIIT work out from YouTube. So what I would suggest is to go slow, build good form and avoid high impact stuff, other than that hemophilia does not expose you to any more joint damage than it does to an average human being (when we do not bleed of course). Severe A here. You can lift weights, just go slower and make sure your positioning etc is correct. If something starts to hurt, there are so many exercises you can trade to work that muscle group you want worked. Ever since the shutdown/virus, I have not been to the gym. I decided to buy some resistance bands, and I have actually think I have found my niche in my fitness game. They are so low impact and you can work as hard as you want, whenever you want. It has changed the game for me honestly, because there are so many YouTube accounts dedicated to teaching you all the exercises you need. Of course this will not get you big and bulky size wise, but it will tone your muscles to no end. Doing these exercises along with some freeweights may be good for you. I am not a hematologist obviously, BUT it has been working for me and I am satisfied with my results so far. If you pull something, hurt something, STOP and nurse/take care of yourself for however long it lasts. Lots of water!! Eggs and veggies every day! Okay now I am on a tangent. Good luck buddy!  \n\nI have been power lifting for just under three years with Haemophilia  and I have not really came across any issues so far.\n\nThe one adjustment I make when lifting is when bench pressing I put the pad that people use for their hips/shoulders so that if it ever contacts my chest in a less controlled way it is cushioned. (You should not really let it hit your chest with too much of an impact but sometimes it happens)\n\nDeadlift no issues, long socks or trousers help with shin scraping but I have personally never found it a problem regarding bleeds. Squatting again no issues. Same goes for any overhead /  dumbell movements. I have gone to multiple HTCs in the US; all of them have encouraged me to lift weights.  They have all explicitly told me to avoid impact cardio (such as running on a treadmill).  So basically, they told me the exact opposite of what you were told.\n\nIn my personal experience weight lifting has had no effect on the number of bleeds that I have had nor has it caused joint degradation.    I will emphasize that I am on prophylaxis.\n\nOut of curiosity:  Where do you live?  I only ask because it would surprise me if a US-based HTC said something like this. I live in Italy , I have had some small joint damage in the past as I lived in Albania and could not do a weekly based prophylaxis ,I did it only when had hard bleeding , have done some surgerys now and it is seems going better , my biggest problem are the legs so I go very easy on them Yeah I just go for bicycle cardio and sometimes when I did treadmill I just went for high inclined and moderate one so I would not have to run . I do not agree with adding extra weight to your upper body especially if your ankles are shot. I always encourage yoga, swimming and cycling, I think its best for us to be toned and light and to keep the extra weight off the joints, I once knew a hemophiliac that was muscling up and and his ankles were shot to hell thought it was the stupidest thing ever. I am a moderate A, as well as an M.D.  This advice is absolutely correct.  While each situation is different, I believe the pros of safe weight training massively outweigh the cons.", "Advice for child refusing treatment? My son is 7. Severe A with a port-o-cath. \nHis dad started treatment training (5yrs late) and I feel he has traumatised him. Since his dad inserted the needle wrong which resorted in a panic among the nurses, that I was called upon to rectify with no problem. My son will not let his dad near him again. He was a little paranoid after this with me also accessing his port but was ok eventually. Thursday his port was swollen and I assumed he would bumped it. He was very anxious during me giving treatment and said it really hurt. Since then he will not let me near him. He has not had factor since Thursday and I am really worried \ud83d\ude14 No amount of convincing or bribery is working. \nAnyone else been through this? Or can advise? It is a hard situation, I am 28 years old and I remember having my mother insert via port and it was never easy, I recommend some sort of numbing spray. Try to not make it a big deal either he is just going to have to get used to it. I still have issues self injecting but it does get easier I used to run away from my parents and hide as a little kid, so totally get where he is coming from. Tbh I do not remember exactly how I got over my fear. I think my parents actually started iv\u2019s on themselves a few times to show me it was ok. Also they bribed the hell out of me with junk food and toys lol. I would recommend just talking to him, validating his fear, but explaining why it is so important and maybe comparing his bravery to some his heroes By 7 you should be talking about him learning to self infuse. It will give him a good feeling of independence. Or you may want to be introduced to Hemlibra. Whatever you do you must include him in the decision process. Best of luck, we are in this together! I am 34 years old and still occasionally find myself stalling or dragging my feet when it comes time for dosing. Our brains are pretty much hardwired to avoid injury. And maybe doubly so self injury. It is not exactly easy to negotiate with that part of your brain either unfortunately so while logically we know it will only make things worse later it still does not change the feeling. It is just something that has to be adjusted to. He will get used to it. I have no experience with port-a-caths but a numbing spray really might help. Thank you everyone! Thing is we use EMLA cream beforehand so it is numbed so not sure why it hurts :-/ \nNurses want to start him on Hemlibra however he is so anxious about anything Haemophilia he is going to kick off also if it comes to using veins. I have tried educating him and explaining everything but it makes him worse. I just do not hear of any other young ones being this distraught. We were doing so well until his dad messed up. I think my brother was actually like this when he was younger too. He had a port. My parents would have him sit in this big chair that was a \u201clion\u201d chair and had a lion plushie head on the top. The chair was in front of the tv so he would also watch cartoons. I think my parents would also give him his favorite snacks I do not remember. He is 20 now but this was when he was probably aged 5 ish to about 8. Maybe I am getting the age wrong. Anti anxiety meds? CBD? We see you.  Just reading all of the comments and the post itself brings back vivid memories First and foremost stop saying that Dad messed it up. Me having hemophilia was extremely hard on my Dad and he blamed himself for a lot of it. Do not forget that your son is not the only one in your life, and they are not the only one struggling. As that relationship with his dad will suffer if the blame is placed on him. I am 35 and still struggle with the shots. It is not just the pain that you fear, you develop a mental block against it. This is all a mental game and has to be approached as such, this cannot be taken too serious or you will go insane. Worrying helps nothing either and will only make it worse on everyone, especially your son. The goal is to keep the infusion as not that big of a deal, the more important you make it the more nervous your son will become. You must find a way to normalize it somehow. I started self infusing when I was eight, but since they have a port self infusion can be a little tricky to teach at that young of an age. It was more difficult for me to learn to stick my port after I got it than it was to hit a vein because of how awkward to was to stick my chest.  There is no good answer anyone can give your for this as each situation is different and so is each mindset, but blaming anyone does not get it done and will only lead to more problems in the future. I know it is hard, but me living my life with my parents blaming each other for stuff that I did is the reason why we do not talk today. Like my son. When he was a toddler I would sit him in his high chair and feed him snacks whilst I would go underneath and treat him. He usually watches tv with no problems to distract Have you looked up hemophilia parents/mom/dad meetings? They do have those in different hemophilia chapters. Since so much is virtual, you could even check out the hemophilia chapters from different states if you are in the US. Also, you could contact WFH, world federation of hemophilia and ask them if they can connect you with different events Thank you for your informative advice. Will definitely take it into consideration. As for the father issue. He has done nothing for our son and we separated when our son was 1yr old through domestic violence, whilst I was holding our haemophiliac son in my arms, he abused me violently. He had chance to train when I did when our son was 2 but after 2 sessions he quit. Now he is taken me to court and enforced going through training, regardless of how our son did not want his father to do it. He injected incorrectly, I have never injected that wrongly in my whole experience of accessing his port. His dad is abusive and an alcoholic also so forgive me for suggesting he messed up. My son was actually managing his haemophilia before this. But I understand you thinking differently I have actually contacted the GP and school and they are doing an assessment on him. Psychologically this has affected him massively. I am not sure in the UK that they medicate young children for anxiety but with be interested to find out if we have that option I am in the UK so will probably see if the Haemophilia society can suggest anything. Thank you. My dad was an alcoholic as well. Had a wreck with me in the car with him as well as he was drunk driving when I was around 5 I believe. I even saw him how a shotgun to my mom's head once. They battled viscously over the years and divorce proceedings were not great either. I was not close to my dad as we felt like we were worlds apart and he hurt my mom. My whole life all I heard was my mom talking bad about my Dad and it kept a strain on ever having a real relationship with my father and never allowed me  to forgive him. Then the day came where I had a blood vessel burst in my stomach and was bleeding to death. As I was going into shock, my dad was there and I heard the tone and hurt in his voice as he begged me not to go. I still hear his screams to this day and that was over 15 years ago now. That is what I am talking about, no matter what they do, they will always be Dad and they will always be the only one that they have. They learn their truth about their Dad through their mom as the son is closer to the mom. Always remember that, as that fact right there is why me and my mom do not talk today. That coupled with the insane invasion of privacy as a child because she was to scared that I would be just like my father. The mental side of this disease is way way more important than the bleeding. It is just as mentally taxing on the father as it is you and the son. The mother tends to get a little egotistical over this for some reason, I know mine really did. So do not let my situation turn into your situation as you do not want this kind of end result with your son. Totally agree with everyone in keeping everything normal and not a big deal. See how he is tomorrow for his treatment before school in the morning and from there. Had a nice talk with him tonight so fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e First and foremost, I never talk bad about my child\u2019s father to my son and my son does not know how I feel or hear about his dads mistake from me. Also can I just say that the fact that you have disowned your mother for your abusive, alcoholic father is very concerning. If you can give that much forgiveness to your father that almost killed you and pointed a gun to your mother, why desert your mother?! Of course mothers worry our sons turn out to be like their abusive fathers it is natural, why would not we?! But obviously you should not vomit this stuff to your child. It is very damaging. But please do not think everyone is painted with the same brush. You need an ego check there chick, and learnt to forgive as you are not perfect either. Secondly, you have no idea how weird this gets and how little anything here matters. When you are lying there dying then you can call this vomit. When you experience that peace where nothing matters and love is all there is, then you can talk about everyone being painted with the same brush.  I disowned my mom because my mom's action put me in prison. We are more alike than you realize and everything is connected. Just like your attitude will ruin your son's view of you. Just continue to bash the father and see how far that gets you later in life. Do not listen to those that have experienced the same situations, what do they know right? Swollen port and the infusion being painful could also mean the port may be to old and failing. Talk his care team to get a xray or ct of the port to rule that out. My son at 5 had the same issue and it was due to hit port having a catastrophic failure (not saying that is what is happening here) but always good to check. My son also absolutely hated being infused by anyone with his port we fully switched to Hemlibra and he has more of a choice in where his infusion is and has the ability to give himself the shot if he is up to it. \n\nSome times kids can start to fear the needles and getting some help to work through that fear is helpful. Thanks. That is a great point! Will definitely consult with the team about this! And thanks for the advice on Hemlibra too! Apparently a psychologist is starting in the department in May so hopefully that helps him also It is not always the first thought when dealing with port and kids refusing to infuse. \nOh that is good that a psychologist will be there in May. In the mean time you can try working with him asking what it is that is bothering him and finding ways to encourage him to do the infusions. Like a infusion buddy, which is a stuffed animal the child can practice doing infusions on themselves. Therapeutic play can be helpful while you wait. That is a brilliant idea thanks. I will definitely try that :) It was something I learned from my time as a patient advocate with a small hemophilia pharmacy. It helped my son greatly and several other kids I worked with. I will never stop recommending it. My son recently started being defiant about treatment. I reached out to my doctor and he got me in contact with the HTC's child psychologist. It was probably the most informative thing I have done because it focused less on Hemophilia and more about why your child feels scared or distraught. She said it is normal, natural and a good response for a kid to want to fight back against something they find painful. How is he after he receives the infusion? If he quickly goes back to being his normal self, it could just be him trying to combat something he does not like (that is not a bad thing). The psychologist recommended I get a play Dr kit, which I did.  After a couple days of \"practicing infusions\" on his toys, pets, me, himself, he seemed more comfortable talking about infusions. When it comes to real infusion time, make sure he is involved in mixing the medicine and knows the process. My kid collects the trash from the medicine and syringes and throws it away, so he can be a part of the prep too. I have silly names for each step of the process which he thinks is funny, and keeps the process light hearted. Like the blood return is \"the train leaving the station\" and then the saline is \"chugga chugga ing down the tube.\" I would recommend talking to a psychologist, they know how to help with certain behaviors and can recommend things you can do to help make it a less anxiety-inducing experience. At 7 years old he does not have all the mental tools to relax himself for something that is admittedly a little intimidating. Give your partner some slack, my husband does not do the infusions either. I know I do not totally love poking my kid, so I get it. I have also done some bad pokes and \"messed it up\" when I was just starting to learn, I think it is good he wants to be involved and will only get better from practice I was so scared of getting my infusions when i was a kid(constantly up to about 11) my port, my arm or my hand, all were a big no. I kicked nurses, i bit them and i scremed til i passed out more times than i can count to. I went to a child-psychiatrist and even tried laughing gas and every distraction you can think of, none worked, not even the gas, i managed to dodge them even without seeing anything or really hearing them while laughing like a maniac, but my fear were to strong. I have very severe type a(I got none of my factor naturally and get bleeds even with medication and always have had) so they had to basically give me something to sleep and then give me it while passed out when I really had to get medicine or basically bleed to death. I dont really remember what made the fear stop. I think it was a mix of getting infected in my port so I had to get it out, wanting to go to hemophilia summercamp by myself and being able to take by myself like my friends and also being put in hospital for about two weeks for a \"infusion bootcamp\". Today I have no fear for it at all, I try new veins whenever I feel like it and today got about 10 different places I rotate between.\n\nThe big thing for me i think was the fear of it hurting like it did once in a while. In the port the sting when piercing the tight skin and when you sometimes would get the scrape against the metal(which still haunts me today). In the hand or arm the sting and the way it could hit a nerve and the pain when someone would have to search for the vein. The most important part here for me, and it kind of sounds like its the same for your son, was the lack of control. I did not know it back then but later I think that was what made it so scary, that you cant control when/if it hurts so you cant really be prepared and you tense up and get anxious.\nSo I would suggest trying to make him as comfortable as possible while doing it, maybe watch TV, talk about something he likes or he reads a book. Make him focus on something else while also making him feel that he is in control. Something that probably made it worse for me was the lack of control, I had a lot of severe bleeds in hips, knees, elbows and feet that jus required medicine now, instantly, and I had no control. If I said no or wait or something like that it just were not possible to wait for the time I needed, and I get that today but I think that is a foundation of the fear I felt and maybe your son feels. If he has to take it before school like I had I understand that the time is not there necessarily but getting a routine and making him feel good around the infusion time will probably help a lot. And making him feel that you understand why and how he feels and helping him understand how important it is that he gets it done is important I think. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, I am on mobile so formatting sucks and I am also not English so I understand that the text is not 100% correct but I hope its possible to read anyway. Get the port checked because it is possible it has been damaged, in this case you will need to move to intravenous injections, go to the hospital or another place that can give the factor through the vein because he needs to get it someway. Talk to the doctor about changing to hemlibra, it is given subcutaneously and last frequently usually, it makes life so much easier. Talk to him about learning to inject himself, it is important to be independent the sooner the better (but do not push him to hard if he is not ready), I regret not learning to earlier. Same No do not apologise I really value your input. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f I am so sorry had to go through this too! My son is severe A too and so very important for prophylaxis. Really appreciate your time to answer and really beneficial to get advice and experience from those who understand:) I am 30, type A severe. I have / had been slacking on my own medical needs for 10 years. Im currently recovering my second ankle surgery. I have so many issues with joints and that is even with my mom treating my via port, every single day for the first 7 or 8 years of my life until I took over. Then I started slacking off more and more and I kept ignoring it and only treating when I had a bleed, its a horrible way of dealing with it.    \n- right ankle fusion because I could not walk at 22.   \n- left ankle clean out because I could not walk at 30.   \n- left elbow clean out because I could not lift things at 20.  \n- right elbow has no cartilage and it basically looks like a T-Rex arm.   \n- muscle mass is pretty small / I am pretty weak because I cannot really lift weights.    \n    \nIf you wanted someone to talk to him that has lived his life, I would be more than willing. If you wanted to do video chat and he could see how messed up his ankles / elbows / joints could be he does not take care of himself, I would not mind. Whatever you think would help him. I have a 5 year old son and 11 year old daughter (technically step daughter so no genetic risk of hemophilia carrier).    \nI learned how to self infuse at 6 at hemophilia summer camp in Michigan, might be a good place to do. I still think about my time there and what an amazing experience it was. Do you use emla numbing cream? I never felt the needle with it Get it checked right away. It could be infected. Agree with this. I did not have anything like as many injections as a child but I did have a phase at a similar age where I hated them. \u201cMagic (emla) cream\u201d made a big difference - I think some of it was psychological as I got used to needles again relatively quickly, it just takes one layer of stress out of it. \n\nMaybe it is time to start getting him to help in prep for self infusing - so rather having something *done* to him, he is actively taking part in it? \n\nMy mom is fascinated by how easy I find self infusing now (I am 40, my OH is more freaked out by my ability to whack a needle in my arm), I just find it tedious as for VWD the volumes are still pretty big \ud83d\ude02 I hope it is a simple as a port replacement Wow that is a lot of issues I am sorry you have gone through that :( my dad had many joint issues with his joints too. Sadly he died in 1998 so my son does not have that familiar family member to consult with. Very lovely of you too offer your time and experience I shall definitely bare it in mind. You were 6?! That is crazy!! Here in the UK we do not have summer camps for that sort of thing. Sounds like a a great way to learn :) Wow that is a lot of issues I am sorry you have gone through that :( my dad had many joint issues with his joints too. Sadly he died in 1998 so my son does not have that familiar family member to consult with. Very lovely of you too offer your time and experience I shall definitely bare it in mind. You were 6?! That is crazy!! Here in the UK we do not have summer camps for that sort of thing. Sounds like a a great way to learn :) So update of today. He woke with an elbow bleed (no surprise why bless him) so he agreed to let me do his treatment. He kept messing me around and not letting me but after I rang the Haemo team and they told me to bring him in, he finally let me. Three syringes in and he ordered me to take it out because of pain. Straight to hospital. The nurses tried for 3 hours to persuade and bribe him to check the ports functioning. At one point they let us go get some fresh air outside, he ran to the car and would not get out the car, saying he is sick of his haemophilia and would rather die, who gave me this and other upsetting things :( One nurse put me at ease saying they all go through this at one stage. Eventually he would only let me insert the needle and the nurses took over. They have done bloods also to check for infection and factor life. Surprisingly no x ray but he said it did not hurt. He made promises to the nurses that he will have his factor tomorrow too. They spoilt him with many gifts too.\nPray for me tomorrow folks lol. I somehow feel that this pain he feels could be psychological paranoia?! We have spoken to him about Hemlibra and the nurses were checking veins. We were all letting him use a tourniquet on us, it could be described as a vein location party lol! You should of seen how he picked up and started using the tourniquet correctly straight away, like he would done it before I was so shocked! \nI definitely need to let him help with the preparation like most have suggested here.\nThank you again for taking the time to give a reply and make me feel less alone.\nAll the best to you all x Yup it was definitely a great place to learn. End up helping to  guide my career into laboratory work as a phlebotomist and moved up to a leadership roll from there. When you get to the self infusions, make sure to order 27 Guage butterfly needles. Theyre incredibly small and do minimal damage to the vein (although it takes longer to push in since you can only go so fast). I have to have over 1k sticks in the vein in my left arm by this point and it still works fine. I got on Helimbra about 7 months ago, and my word it is been amazing. Everyone is different of course, but I wish I had this so much as a kid. I have had 1 bleed in 7 months, and that is bc I really screwed up my back. \n\nIt is such a massive improvement, and the tiny needle in the belly is basically nothing compared to port, and intravenous injections. \n\nAs for the port, or any injection really, you may already use this, but they make a numbing cream you can put on about 30 minutes before hand and it made a huge difference for me as a kid. \n\nAlso, when your kid is more comfortable, definitely start experimenting with self care. It really helped me as a kid, especially psychologically. I felt more in control over my disease, and helped so much. \u0130snt there under the skin treatment newly developed? There's Hemlibra. Is that what you're referring to? It's sub-q and not intravenous. But it's not clotting factor. It takes the place of prophylaxis. Works, imho, MUCH better than factor for prophy. It is not however intended to stop episodic bleeding. For actual injury or high risk activity you still need clotting factor. I\u2019m late to the party but I learned how to self infuse at a very early age like 5-6 and never had a port. The biggest thing to me is making sure he understands why he needs this medication and teaching him to do it himself. That said I always preferred when my mother did my infusion and once my parent got divorced anytime I was with my dad and had trouble hitting the vein myself I absolutely refused to let him do it and we would go see my mom to do it. \n\nSometimes a little boy just needs his mother. If you knew my father and how ham fisted bull in a China cabinet he was about things you\u2019d know why I didn\u2019t want him to stick me lol. \n\nOut of curiosity is there a reason he has a port? I\u2019m 32 and have been self infusing for 26 years now and never had a port. That almost daily dozing with needle sounds like a hell. No offense, I mean to say there needs to different solutions found. Arent there any rich people who would dump money on this to make it simpler and earn money via funds etc. Elon would do xprize on this for 1 mil maybe. Hemlibra isn't daily. Depending on bodyweight and need it's either weekly or biweekly. I do mine on Friday. It's a 28 gauge needle too! About the size of the ones diabetics use for insulin. I can barely feel it. Hemlibra is same with hemopilia? Hemlibra is a non-clotting factor prophylactic treatment for Hemophilia Type A. Depending on where you live in the world it is approved for use in Severe to Mild Hemophiliacs both with and without inhibitors. It is administered by subqutaneous injection. Depending on weight, age and severity of condition it is administered once weekly, or once every other week. \n\nPretty interesting stuff. It is an engineered antibody that basically does the same job clotting factor protein VIII does. Which is chiefly to activate factor X. Basically tricks the blood into thinking factor VIII is present and doing its job. But it lasts MUCH longer in the body than clotting factor does.", "Hemophilia C (Factor XI Deficiency) Hi all. I just joined. Anyone else here with Factor XI deficiency (aka Hemophilia C, PTA deficiency, or Rosenthal syndrome)? My mom and I both have it. I have only met two others (sisters) who had it, but that was probably 20 years ago. Wow that is rare i am type B severe i do not think i have ever met someone with type C My partner tells me I am a rare, shiny Pok\u00e9mon. \n\nFor right now I fall into a mild-to-moderate category. My type is hard to predict because there is an incomplete correlation between factor deficiency and symptom severity (for example, somebody with very low factor levels can have no bleeding problems and vice versa apparently). Also, as far as I know, Factor XI is not available in the United States so I am limited in my treatment options if I ever need it. Just fresh frozen plasma. Wow, I think you win the rare bird contest. But do not worry, we accept you just the same. I am interested to hear the differences between factor XI and XIII or Nine, or Wonwilibrands. Since I know how 8 and 9 work (basically the same symptoms, and VWbrands which is its own separate thing.. How do you bleed? That is too bad, getting plasma administered sounds intimidating. My symptoms have evolved over time. When I was a kid they were mostly related to spontaneous nosebleeds. Sometimes I would swallow it without realizing and then vomit blood (scared the shit out of my parents). Other times I would pull clumps of congealed blood out of my sinuses. \n\nAround puberty I grew out of nosebleeds and into menorrhagia. I would have heavy periods lasting 3-4 weeks at a time. I would bleed through my pants and get sent home from school a lot. I would also occasionally get muscle aches from swimming, but not sure if that was related to the hemophilia because I thought swimming was supposed to be okay for hemophiliacs. That all lasted a couple years. \n\nNowadays my symptoms are pretty manageable. I do not have menorrhagia anymore (for now). My most common symptom is just random bruising. I do not really have major bleeding episodes that are not tied to trauma or surgery so I feel fortunate in that regard. I just have to be cautious about surgery (or childbirth) and will likely need plasma as a precaution. Other than that I do not do anything for my type C. TIL Hemophilia goes past the letter B. Hem-C sounds like a cool nickname, though. Welcome to the family! Go Mavs! Thanks! I am fairly new to Reddit and just learned how to add flair (I saw you have yours set). Looks like there is not a Type C flair option. Story of my life! \ud83d\ude05 Oh me! I found out a few months ago and life is making way more sense. \n\nApparently my grandpa and my dad both have it, but my dad did not think much of it until he turned 70 and had a clotting issue. Since it is on my dad's side, we did not put two and two together for years that that is what was causing the menorrhagia. I also had tons of nosebleeds as a kid, but also had a ton of allergies so no one thought anything of it. Mine seems to be mild at the moment. \n\nI did my first round of iron transfusions 2 months ago and it is literally been life-changing. That persistent ache of exhaustion behind my eyes just vanished. Wooooo! A blood buddy! Haha\n\nI wonder if I need an iron transfusion lol. My under-eyes and eyelids always turn purple by the end of the day, so much so that my SO gets concerned people are going to think my SO is giving me black eyes. \n\nI have not seen a hematologist in probably 15 years, but I have an appointment in a couple weeks to finally get checked out. I would HIGHLY recommend it. I only went in to get the diagnosis confirmed because my gynos have never really believed me about how heavy my periods were. I just wanted the diagnosis so they would have to take it seriously. But my hematologist was fantastic and actually read my chart and believed me (so sad that this makes me so excited). He really pushed the iron transfusions. He said given my levels of iron it is be essentially impossible to get enough back in my system orally. \n\nIt is two sessions of transfusion, then you reup every 6-12 months. Honestly it was kind of nice. At my hospital they bring around lunch and snacks and goodie bags. I read a book for an hour and then felt like super woman. Just found this thread, i am 33 female in UK, me and my mum and older brother have factor 11. \nI have had 2 babies and both times i have had plasma beforehand to help clot and tranexamic acid tablets afterwards. All went well. I bruise very easily usually more on my legs (probably the kids jumping on me) but does not usually cause any problems, the odd nose bleed. I think i am 48%. I am only just researching my deficiency more now since it affected me through pregnancy and labour, nice to find more people with it!", "UPDATE: I am worried by surgeon is not taking my bleeding disorder seriously. Thank you all so much for your support! Your support and kindness was greatly beneficial and I want to give you an update. \n\nAfter my original post, I checked in with my surgeon to go over the plan. I was unable to get information from him. Thankfully, I got a call from the surgery coordinator at the hospital later that day. I told her about my concerns and she told me she was going to look into it and call me back. Apparently, he had received the letter from my hematology team and had already ordered the medication and transfusions that were recommended. I suppose he just did not have the time for open communication? It was shitty, but thankfully it was taken care of.\n\nI had the surgery today. From what I have heard, it went well. Minimal bleeding. I have to stay in the hospital overnight and he will review everything with me in the morning. My problem right now is pain management. I cannot have NSAIDS, so that adds extra levels of fuckery and pain. \n\nAgain, thank you all for your support! \ud83d\udc9c Codeine with paracetamol or tramadol for pain.

I am assuming I will just get factored up and have to maintain a high level for a week or so at least. Talking to my HTC next week. I have had an appendectomy and it was fairly simple.  They kept me a day longer than usual to be safe.  I have also had a calcium deposit removed from my hip, arthroscopic surgery on my knees separately, then both knees replaced separately, a root canal, and an ingrown toenail cut out.  It is always the same, just let my hematologist know and she or a nurse is there to make sure I get my factor before surgery and they set me up with a higher dose for a couple weeks or so while I heal.  As long as a hematologist is monitoring your levels before and after surgery, most any surgery is uneventful.  Remember that you are ultimately responsible for yourself so do not be afraid to question any doctor or surgeon if you do not understand or agree with their methods.  The only people I have had problems with have been physical therapists but luckily I have a good HTC.  Good luck. I am severe A and I had my gallbladder removed. It was very smooth.

After seeing many posts from here and experiencing with my own life I feel like there should be a place where we can access information regarding this silly little condition of ours. So, I have decided to make this place myself by starting a YouTube channel. Currently I am in the process of gathering ideas (also my ankle is hurt so I cannot make anything at the moment) after reading how someone lost their job due to this condition I want to help all my brothers and sisters. I have ideas like how to self inject, how to workout, what to eat, what not to eat, and what can we do when we feel demotivated or disappointed with ourselves when hurting/bleeding. I am not going to establish this for the views or likes or popularity I just want you all to know how to truly be independent and let these so called 'normal' people know how amazing we can be. I will be working on this very soon. I hope to see you guys there.\n\nBe safe! All the best! Thank you! these videos can help someone out. we will support you! I really appreciate that man! Hey dude. Go for it! I started a YouTube channel a few of years ago focused on my sharing my Haemophilia experiences. I am awfully inconsistent at uploading haha but it has been something I have really enjoyed doing. Definitely worth it. Since then I have seen a few other guys start making YouTube videos about their condition too. It is great to see. I look forward to seeing your first video and feel free to reach out if you have any questions That is really amazing mate! I would love to see your work. Please send me your channel. Absolutely I would reach out with you for a collab if you are up for it we can spread information to those in need! I will let you guys know this week when the video is up, thanks for the support! I approve. You may proceed. Also thank you. That is fucking awesome! Just found this sub and it is really cool to hear everyone is experiences and relate.

There was not blood in the knee at the echography. The day after, it was not swollen anymore and did not complained. The doctor gave him an antifibrinolytic to take for one week. He also told to immobilize his leg. Now 2 days later, he ... ... says that it hurts him and a little bruise appeared. Is this the regular procedure ? Cannot the antifibrinolytic hurt him if he takes it while maybe not necessary (what is the point if there is not blood in the joint or in the wound)? This sounds like an outdated treatment plan I had growing up in the late '90s/early '00s. What country are you in? Typically with a soft tissue or muscle bleed, bruising can occur after the bleed starts to resolve.  So that is perfectly normal in my experience.\n\nFrom what you described in previous post,  disclaimer I am not a doctor, is sounds like maybe this was not a joint bleed but soft tissue bleed.  Caused by the trauma of falling. Is the bruise on the top of the knee or the sides?\n\nAslo in my experience soft tissue tend to hurt after they start to heal.  Does hurt to touch, move or just rest is causing pain.  If it is a joint bleed and it is getting worse the pain will throb all the time even at rest.  \n\nHowever, if you are concerned you should call you HTC.

That is asking for trouble. Yes. Why do you tell that ? Personal experience. Used to be prescribed one dose, which may or may not clear up, and in the latter cases resulting in cumulative damage to the joints. Making the next bleed even easier to trigger. Ok.

This was after I decided to try keto for a couple of months, and was noticing some physical  changes happening. So now marks my six month point, and here is what I am happy to report:\n\n**Hemo results:**\n\n* Joint bleeds have reduced by about 50%. I am not directly attributing this to what I am eating, but rather the weight I have lost. Much less stress on ankles, knees, hips. I rarely have joint bleeds nowadays anyway because I am diligent about prophy; but I have definitely observed a decrease in achiness and pain.\n* Arthritis pain I have had in my ankles is gone. This is what originally started me on keto. I think extra weight I had gained was putting tremendous pressure on my ankles. They are both fused, so when I say \"ankle\" I mean all of the surrounding joints.\n* Minor bruising increased for the first month or two, but now it is back to pre-keto levels\n* I used to have terrible nosebleeds on almost a daily basis... those have completely disappeared. In fact, I had a nosebleed yesterday for the first time since March, and I think that was due to heat/humidity when I was walking at lunch.\n\n**Non-hemo results:**\n\n* I have lost 28lbs and 2 inches from my waistline (15% of my starting weight). 2 pounds to go to reach my first goal weight. (200 to 172)\n* I also had IBS w/constipation symptoms for years, are they are now completely resolved. \n* 2 months ago, my Vitamin D level was very low. PCP prescribed a high level dose (50000/wk over 8 weeks) and it is now back to normal.\n* My blood glucose, cholesterol, trigs, potassium, liver function, renal function, blood pressure, etc., all normal. PCP is very happy with my progress.\n\nThese are just my own personal results, but I am pretty rocked about how much I have benefited from keto.", "Blood in Sperm!! Can anyone help me ..

Obviously med students and such like that will understand and be more open minded about dating a bleeder than some of these backwoods ignorant hicks might be lol. If you are looking for some after date extra curricular activities sometimes it is easier to not mention it for awhile because I have found myself having to explain what hemophilia is and that it is not contagious before which really ruins the mood.

I cannot remember if I had it on my tinder profile or not, but I did meet my wife on tinder so, hey! I have a noticable limp which really helps lead into the \"yeah, have some damage caused by my hemophilia.\" I typically like to get it out of the way with anyone, not just partners, as early as possible. If you have any complication due to your hemophilia might be a good way to lean into it. Yeah, even though I am not that old I already developed quite a limp. And also the orthopedic shoes I wear 24/7 make it quite apparent that something is a bit off. During my first year of Uni I needed to mention it on the first conversation because I was the only one walking with a cane. It usually comes up for me because it is related to my work. But when I did not work with hemophiliacs I would still mention it before too long just because of talking about myself. I do not think it is something that you would be blamed for holding back tho. It should not affect dating. I was brought up with not a single person not knowing about my condition, in school and what not. I am 23 and engaged, my partner knew from very early. She knew the knock on effect for our children when we decide to have them and she knew the effect it has on me in day to day life. But the whole time we have been together she has supported me and understands when to step in and explain my condition because as I am sure many of you guys are tired of repeatedly explaining what haemophilia is, like I am.

What the deal with broken bones as a hemophelic. Thinking about riding motorcycles so just in case yuh know\u2026 does it take longer or weirder to heal. How much longer. For example broken rib or wrist bones. Ty in advnace Probably not longer for the bone to heal but most likely a ton of factor for it and ancillary injuries. Everyone I have ever known with a motorbike put it down at least once, often not their fault. Good luck. My dad said i shouldent have a motorcycle because if i break a bone itl take for example 12 months compared to normal guys 2 months. Is he right? That is not correct. I have broken bones and had surgery on bones (screws), and the healing time is really no different IF you take your factor as advised by your doctor. If you do not take factor it could take months to properly heal.  Not the bone so much, but the tissue around it. \n\nWhen I was a kid I was screaming along on my bicycle on steep downhill slope and my chain broke. I ate it, slid along the road for who knows how many feet.  Did not tell my parents and I had a visible bruise along my upper leg for almost a year. Had I just taken some factor right away, and maybe some boosters over the next few days, I am pretty certain I do not have bleeding in my leg for almost a year. The concern that your dad likely has is not necessarily that broken bones will take longer to heal, it is that it is so fucking risky as a hemophiliac to ride a motorcycle (which is already dangerous enough). Even a minor problem for the average rider can be disastrous for a hemophiliac, as the threshold for brain injury is so high. You can take every precaution in the world (helmets, skid plates, etc) and it will not matter if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nTo answer your question: no, the time for bones to heal does not change. The only difference is the clotting. If you break a bone that causes internal bleeding, THAT is life threatening and extremely dangerous for us bleeders. Do you think i can ride motos if i take helimbra? You think helimbra makes it any safer? Just into motos and almost 18 so idk what to do Honestly more than broken bones I would worry about head injuries. Not telling you not to ride, got to live your life the way you want but motorcycles are dangerous and head injuries are very scary for us.\n\nAs far as broken bones go, i broke my wrist and I do not think it was very different from anyone else. I took my factor for the same amount of time I would have a regular bleed and did not have any issues rehabing. Everyone is different though. I thank the lord everyday that i havent gotten any serious injuries yet. Im 17 btw and wrestle. But is a head injury a big thing to hemophelics compared to everything else That is awesome. I am all for sports and generally being as active as possible. When I was your age I skated, played football (not for school), played Dance Dance Revolution. I have the body of a 70 year old now but I do not regret any of it. It is really just about risk assessment. Is riding a motorcycle worth the risk that comes with it or can you find equal joy in life elsewhere. My advice would be to just really think about it and make sure it is worth the risk. \n\nA head injury is definitely more serious to us. I am not referring to scrapes and bruises but bleeding internally which can happen from any serious blow to the head is not something you want to mess with. With our joint injuries we can develop lasting damage which may decrease our quality of life over time but a head injury can be life ending. Dam. Ok ty so much bro. Isnt football like a head injury factory tho? Anyways glad you did everything and turned out ok. Howw does hem effect u in older ages? Football is definitely a head injury risk too which is why I only played with my friends and not in a competitive form. Skateboarding was also dangerous to an extent but when my friends were ollying down stairs and whatnot I just did not do it.\n\nFor me personally (34) I have some bad arthritis in most of my joints which makes walking difficult and has caused lots of back pain. If you have not had too many bleeds I would not worry about it too much, that is what causes the degeneration of joints. I never understood what bleeds ment in a hemophelic term. Like im sure ive had some but idk how they feel. Inside bleeds. Also does helimbra do anything special? I raced go-karts as a kid, oval track cars in my teens, and ride a motorcycle very often now. That is what factor is for, live your life the way you want man. No sense in living if you cannot do the things you want and take risks. Just take a safety course and gear up with what you can. If you have the money get an airbag jacket or suit and your chance of injury will be greatly reduced. Wow ty dude. Thinking of getting a used any bike 250cc then upgrade to cbr650r motorcycle. Also have u had injuries. How did it go for u if you did? No broken bones, but plenty of bleeds, strains, and sprains. Worst racing accident I bruised every single rib front and back and I was back at it the next weekend. Just get the 650 to start, you will get bored with the 250cc in a weekend. I ride a 17' SV650 and it is a great bike, no issues other than regular maintenance which is minimal. I have not dropped the bike(knock on wood) but I also rode quads and dirt bikes as a kid and went down and flipped a bunch in the woods and just got regular bleeds. \n\nMy main advice is just make sure you learn to properly ride and try to expect the unexpected. Never trust traffic will do what they are supposed to. Always be alert essentially, and keep your eyes where you want to go, most crashes are from panicking and looking at the side of the road or a nearby pole/guard rail and you tend to ride exactly to where your eyes are. Wow ty dude. Ya i think it is smarter to just take more moto practice classes to then just buy what i want from the getco. Do u take helimbra? No I treat as needed with Recombinate. I was a mild with a 7-11% factor level for a long time but for a few years now my level has only peaked at 3% and sometimes is down to 1% since I have a low level inhibitor. So I am a little better off than most of us, but I still get bleeds pretty easy, some are just from normal use and repetitive motion. If I am going to do something with high risk I tend to pre-treat now to be safe and avoid the bleed. So lets say i drive my moto everyday for a while. Should i take factor all those days? Probably, but ask your doctor to be sure! If you are geared up and not going to ride at high speeds, you should be fine with whatever routine you have for factor. Thinking of driving normaly but in a straight were theres nobody that can possibly crash into me, rip the throttle for 2 secs. Hi there! Hem A Moderate. I saw you had alot of good people answering your question but just wanted to throw in my two cents. I am 23 and have gone through an internal stomach bleed (before I knew I had the condition) and a 4-5 year old knee injury (also went though internal bleeding in the joint). The stomach thing I believe was from a punch I took to the gut from my uncle when we were play boxing, was a fairly strong punch. Luckily, the bleeding eventually stopped on it is own. My knee injury went a bit different. It swole up pretty bad and left me unable to walk for a few months. I believe I injured it from jumping upand down repeatedly at my Highschool dance. Received factor for it after it had gotten all swollen and let the blood diffuse out over time. It is now been a couple years and I still feel mild discomfort/ weakness in my knee from that experience but now my other healthy knee is feeling run down from taking most of my weight. Oh well. Basically what I want you to take from my experiences is be careful! Even the smallest little weird injuries/impacts could cause a bleed. I still like to ride motorcycles in Mexico with my cousins but these days I try not to drive tooo fast and drive more precautios just incase I do end up in a bad spot. The best advice my hemophilia doc gave me is give yourself a few years to understand your body and see how hemophilia affects it. (Does your body hold up well under more intense activities or not). Over time you will see what activities you can do freely without a problem or what activities you should try to avoid. Take care man, we are all going through life feeling down about not being able to do too many crazy things but do not feel bad or alone about it :) Hopefully the future holds good fortune for us hemophiliacs", "Accommodations Do you have any tips for someone with the fear of getting blood drawn/ needles?

Any advice helps, thank you!", "STAT: The Return of Vioxx  The article is behind a #paywall After surviving hemophilia, hepatitis C, and HIV, Joseph Burke considers himself a walking miracle. But the medical odyssey that saved his life has also ravaged his joints, and now each day begins in pain, whether from his ankles, knees, shoulders, or all of the above.\n\n\u201cI just white-knuckle it, grit my teeth, and here I am, you know?\u201d said Burke, 41.\n\nBurke suffers from a side effect of hemophilia called hemophilic arthropathy, a buildup of blood in the joints that leads to pain, inflammation, and tissue damage. There are no approved therapies, and the most commonly prescribed pain treatments are opioids. Burke\u2019s prescription is a single daily tablet of Percocet.\n\n\u201cThere are days where I am sitting there, like, \u2018What if I just take one more half?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a constant mental battle. That part scares the crap out of me, honestly.\u201d\n\nHe wants a treatment that can soothe his pain without the anxiety of keeping an addictive drug in his home. And he is pinning his hopes on a decades-old pill more famous for class action lawsuits than medical miracles: Vioxx. \n\nThe pain drug became synonymous with pharmaceutical risk more than 15 years ago when studies revealed that it roughly doubled patients\u2019 risk of heart attack and stroke, leading to an estimated 60,000 deaths. That led to a congressional investigation, allegations of lapses at the Food and Drug Administration, and agreement by the manufacturer, Merck, to pay a nearly $5 billion settlement and pull Vioxx off the market.\n\nFor years, though, Tremeau Pharmaceuticals, a privately held Massachusetts drug company, has been seeking to resurrect the drug \u2014 Merck\u2019s patents have expired \u2014 and pressing forward with a plan to convince the Food and Drug Administration to approve Vioxx for patients with hemophilic arthropathy.\n\nEarlier this year, the FDA signed off on Tremeau\u2019s plan to run a placebo-controlled trial that would support that approval, and the company has secured $110 million in financing from the blue-chip investment firm Gurnet Point Capital, which will fund the study in its entirety. Tremeau expects to begin recruiting patients this month. \n\nFor Brad Sippy, the company\u2019s founder, it is been a long time in the making. Sippy worked in Merck\u2019s marketing division in the 2000s, and one of his jobs was managing the Vioxx recall. He remembers receiving angry mail, accusing Merck of causing so much suffering. \n\n\u201cBut then after about three or four months, it quickly flipped over to \u2018When is this coming back?\u2019 and \u2018I would do anything and sign anything to get it back.\u2019 And a lot of that was people with hemophilia,\u201d he said.\n\nVioxx had long been the off-label drug of choice for hemophilic arthropathy, preferred by doctors because it could relieve pain without the increased bleeding risks inherent to other anti-inflammatory drugs. The cardiovascular issues were real but manageable with patient monitoring and careful prescribing, doctors said. Vioxx\u2019s recall \u201cleft a void in our arsenal,\u201d said Catherine Broome, a hematologist at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cIt was a sad day,\u201d Mark Skinner, who has hemophilic arthropathy, said of the Vioxx recall. Skinner, 60, counted on the drug for pain relief but now takes Celebrex. It has the same mechanism as Vioxx, but the results are inferior, he said.\n\n\u201cIs my memory perfect from 30 years ago? Probably not,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cBut my buddies and I think about the good old days, and Vioxx worked. There is no question that it worked and it was better.\u201d\n\nTremeau\u2019s plan is to enroll about 160 people with hemophilic arthropathy between the ages of 12 and 75 and randomize them to either placebo or Vioxx, whose generic name is rofecoxib. After three months, patients in the placebo group will be able to switch over to rofecoxib, and Tremeau will follow them for another year to study long-term safety. \n\nThe goal is to prove that rofecoxib can ease the burden of hemophilic arthropathy, which Tremeau is measuring using a patient-reported scoring system of daily pain. If the drug is significantly better than placebo at keeping those scores low, the study will be deemed a success.\n\nBut the answer will not come quickly. In order to properly isolate the variables, Tremeau is requiring that patients who enter the trial discontinue any pain treatments they are already taking before entering the study. For some patients, that would mean spending at least three months without their regular painkillers, with only rescue medicines to rely on in the event of breakthrough pain. Sippy acknowledged that it might prove discouraging for some eligible participants, and Tremeau expects it may take a year or more to recruit all the patients it needs.\n\nSkinner, who was formerly president of the nonprofit World Federation of Hemophilia, said the challenge will not be insurmountable. The community of people with hemophilia has an abiding interest in participating in research that might improve the lives of fellow patients, he said. There is a group of people, affectionately known as \u201cstudy boys,\u201d who are game for just about anything that might benefit the community, Skinner said. And for Vioxx, a drug for which he has such fond memories, \u201cI would be in that \u2018study boy\u2019 category,\u201d he said.\n\nTo Tyler Buckner, a hematologist who treats hemophilic arthropathy at University of Colorado Health, the potential return of Vioxx presents a welcome option for patients who are often forced to make do with mediocre pain treatment. About half of Buckner\u2019s patients with hemophilia deal with chronic pain. Celebrex works for some but is \u201cfrustratingly inadequate,\u201d he said. Opioids can be effective but require constant monitoring and present risks some patients find frightful. If Vioxx proves safe and effective, it would bring an eagerly desired alternative.\n\n\u201cIt would be a huge boon to quite a few of my patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could take my patients who are on opioids and replace some or all of them on a treatment that was effective, that would be huge.\u201d\n\nFor Burke, an effective treatment for hemophilic arthropathy would make the walking part of being a \u201cwalking miracle\u201d a little easier. If the Tremeau trial is a success, rofecoxib would be the only medicine developed specifically for his condition; it would be \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d for a group of patients accustomed to settling for whatever they can get, he said.\n\nBurke has been in a reflective mood in recent months, as he is been using his pandemic downtime to get to work on a memoir, working title \u201cBloody Incredible.\u201d Growing up in southeastern Kentucky, caregivers did not know much about hemophilia and the many precautions it required, and Burke\u2019s efforts to fit in with other kids led to frequent bleeding episodes. The treatment that kept him alive through childhood, one derived from donated blood, also made him one of the more than 10,000 hemophilia patients who unwittingly contracted hepatitis C and HIV. Thousands would eventually die of AIDS.\n\nThe advent of ever-more-powerful medicines means kids today will not have to go through what he did, and the prospect of gene therapy promises to bring a functional cure for hemophilia in his lifetime. He feels superlatively fortunate to witness that, and obliged to make sure the history of hemophilia is not lost.\n\n\u201cI am kind of a torch carrier,\u201d Burke said. \u201cYou read about Ryan White and Ricky Ray, the hemophiliacs who succumbed to AIDS, and you just pause for a minute. They are not here. You carry the torch for a generation that will not know or understand what it was like.\u201d\n\nThe ensuing decades brought medical advances that would dramatically change his life: treatments that reduced his risk of bleeding, drugs that transformed HIV from a death sentence to a chronic disease, and a cure for hepatitis C, which he received in 2014. He has not had a bleeding episode since 2018.\n\nAll that remains is the joint pain. And to Burke, the potential return of Vioxx offers a chance at relief.\n\n\u201cThat is the exciting part,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThere is potential. There is hope. Finally the veil has been torn away from this specific area of the bleeding disorder community.\u201d", "1 month factor Hi all. I have hemophilia A and my doctor mentioned about 2 years a go about a 1 month factor. I take mine rn every other day. I also wrestle although i try to be careful on what i do. Just wana know your opinions on if i should take it. Or what it really is. Any side effects. My final wresting season is this winter and after that im thinking of just chilin. Id be nice to have some educated opinions. Ty! You are probably talking about Hemlibra, as it maintains protection from bleeding for a longer period of time than, say, a regular factor. I, too, dont know much abt it search the word \u201cHemlibra\u201d in this subreddit and you will find plenty of info. Hemlibra is a created antibody that... Basically does what clotting factor VIII does. In simplest terms the primary function of factor VIII is the activation of Factor X. Hemlibra does this without needing factor VIII. It essentially tricks the clotting process into responding as though factor viii were present and functioning normally. Consequently this is why not equivalent to Hemlibra exists for Type B's. A fact which I genuinely lament for those amongst us so inflicted. \n\nIt is not a clotting factor and it is also not a protein. Because of this it has a MUCH higher halflife in your body than typical proteins do. Depending on weight and severity of hemophilia it can be dosed weekly, bi-weekly, or (in rarer cases and among smaller children) monthly.\n\nBefore I started taking Hemlibra I read both Genetech's promotional literature on it as well as the published research studies submitted to medical journal as well as the FDA for consideration and approval. \n\nOn a personal note I absolutely LOVE this medication. Not only because my chronically bleeding and severely damaged ankles feel better. After 8 weeks I barely bruise. My nose does not bleed like it used to. Accidentally gave my thumb a decent tap with while woodworking. A couple years ago that would have swelled so badly the pain would have been unbearab. Barely any sign of a bruise under the thumbnail now. The swelling in my ankles is always lower than it was previously. It is a simple subqutaneous injection. Like insulin. You draw it, already a liquid (no mixing) from one or more tiny vials into a syringe with a ~28gauge needle and inject it into some fat. No intravenous injection! No hunting veins. I recommend that ANYONE (mild, moderate, severe, w/wo inhibitors) who has this as a treatment option look into it. Ask your hematologist! If you live in an area of the world that has not yet approved this for use for people with no inhibitors or those less than severe... Write whatever amounts to your country's political leadership and tell them you want it to be available to you as well! Hemlibra is great. I have found that I still get bleeds sometimes if I do really strenuous activities, I imagine wrestling might sometimes cause a bleed that requires regular factor. Hemlibra works great for most stuff , but it raises your factor level to about the equivalent of 40% (but it lasts 30 days), where as a dose a factor will raise your levels to around 100%, but that will be at 50% after 12 hours, and down to 10% after 30 hours (something like that) , so that is why you need to infuse every other day. So Hemlibra is great, but you might still get a bleed sometimes, but as long as you infuse right away for it , it should be fine. You can infuse on top of Hemlibra with no overclotting or other problems. I use about 1/15th of the factor I used to. Things have improved for me , mainly because now I do not have to infuse every other day. Which is hard to do. So I think that if you do not mind infusing every other day, then you should stay on factor because it does work a little better. But for most people , doing Hemlibra once every two weeks (not IV, but a quick shot under the skin, which is way easier) is so much easier that being at 40% consistently is better for most of us. I think. It is a lot to figure out, but I bet you would like Hemlibra. And if you do not then you could always switch back. Can i workout or lets say, practice self defense fighting with helimbra? I would think so. It depends on what kind of shape you are in. I bet if you are already doing a lot of physical stuff and not getting too many bleeds then Hemlibra should work fine. You just might have to make sure that you can still get factor too, because you might need to still infuse sometimes for injuries. I would just make sure your dr knows that you do martial arts and that you want to keep factor on hand incase of injuries. Then see how it goes. Waiiiiit. I thought you could only do one of them. Like u got to choose. No? So im livin normaly with helimbra but if i get a serious injury i can put the other one? Yes. You use both. Hemlibra works to keep most bleeds from happening. But people still need factor for injuries or surgery, anything that would definitely cause a bleed.", "Travel and School Letters (and College Letters) I am a pediatric treater.  I have set up travel letters in our EMRs to customize for our patients to use when traveling.  Aside from the usual diagnosis and emergency dose/contact statements, have any of you encountered something that you would want to have added to a pediatric travel letter?  Same with school.  I have a canned letter that is customized for the patient, and I would like to know if you encountered any specific problem in your school that we could add.  Any of you get 504 hearings to set up IEPs due to your hemophilia?\n\nLastly, I want to compose a College Letter that we can send along with our patients to college, as we tend to keep the guys till after college so their records stay in one place till they move to where ever their jobs take them.   Any thoughts as to what you would want in such a letter?  \n\nThanks As far as the college letter, I think it is usually best for students to go through the disability services at the given institution, so they can get all the paperwork, etc. to give to professors. Generally, professors do not need to, and legally cannot, ask about the specific nature of a student's disability, and just need to know the necessary accommodations.  Thanks, that is something I can add to my patient advice.  Any items you would add to a letter that the patient could take with them to college?  I will work on a letter for the disability office. I do not think much, could just outline reasonable accommodations on a case by case basis. For me, it was just extra time for exams and assignments in the case of hospitalization or other complications. Could also include accessibility if a wheelchair or crutches are ever needed.  I know this is a late reply, but...In addition to the lived experience that brought me here I also have training as a school counselor. Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders will qualify for a 504, but at times the child/family/doc/etc. will have to really fight for it. By law a 504 provides accessibility; some folks who write 504s/decide who gets them (I will refer to them as gatekeepers) say if a problem has not caused issue at school so far, there is no need for a 504 because accommodations have not been needed. For example, a teenage girl with Von Willebrand disease may have a mild form, and may not typically have noticeable symptoms at school, but there is the potential she may cut her shoulder if she is at a locker and someone runs into it, closing the door and the metal edge cutting her. Or maybe she slips and cuts herself in art, carpentry, or cooking class. Just any freak accident. The potential for need is there, the documented result of potential injury is there, and slight accomodations may be appropriate in some circumstances. For example, maybe the 504 simply specifies in courses where she will be around sharp objects or using them to cut food/lumber/whatever, the teacher be notified of her disease, potential outcomes of her being cut, and aware of what to do if it happens, and keep an extra eye on her. It is warrented for sure, some districts it is going to be a fight though.\n\nBleeding/Clotting Disorders will not qualify for an IEP unless there is a simultanious physical, intellectual, or mental health disability which requires the curriculum to be altered. Where 504s alter accessability to general educatin curriculum, IEPs also alter the education itself. For example, if that teenage girl also had an IQ of 68, then she would qualify for an IEP and the 504 related services would be built into it.\n\nThe only other major curve ball you might need to know about is mental health. Most mental health related disorders qualify for 504s, not IEPs, in most districts and most circumstances. There might be a place to argue IEP for emotional disability in students with bleeding disorders whose mental health results in self-injury that, due to the bleeding disorder, may be more medically significant, IF the self-injury is linked to school based triggers (high stakes testing, sensory stuff, noise, whatevs). \n\nOf course, at the college level there is just Accessibility Services who, under the 504 law, accommodate all of the above based on best practices.\n\nHope this helps!", "Insurance Problems Hey fellow hemobros\n\nI am a moderate/severe hemophiliac and I am currently having difficult getting my factor (Advate) through my insurance company as my coverage is being handled incorrectly. Are there any companies or agencies I can contact to assist me and help push through to get my factor? Are there ways to get emergencies doses? I usually infuse prophy but all I have left is 1 dose so I am trying to hold onto that for an emergency. Otherwise I have to wait it out until November 1st, and I am quite frankly scared because my target joints are acting up already.\n\nAny insight would be a major help! Thanks everyone. Does Advate have a patient assistance program?   I would contact them and see what they can do to help. I was going to say exactly this.

Here is the link for Advate\n\n(  Seconded. If you live in the US, call HFA and ask about their Helping Hands program. They might know what to do. You should also submit your story for their CALLS project. Start with the resources already mentioned, then if you have problems, contact your HR office at the business you work in (if you get insurance through work) and they may be able to help get it sorted.

My state has a consumer affairs office and the IC is not at all afraid to get medieval on a company if one of the taxpayers is not getting the quality customer service they deserve.  Yours probably does as well.  Nobody in the Deep State is going to want symapthetic victims with TV camera laden \"Channel XXX is on your side\" crews pouring into their offices. Thank you, both of you, for your help. I have submitted my story at CALLS.  I am going to reach out tomorrow to the local chapter, but I recently have moved so I am not sure how I will be received.  Based on the information I am receiving from my provider and nurses that have been trying to help me, I am definitely contacting the state. Someone deleted my pharmacy benefit, which includes my monthly premium and deductible, in accident which is causing me to go through this month without any factor. Absolutely disgusting on this insurance company's end.  Call your insurance company and get a case manager.  They may be able to fix it quickly. I will be as soon as 8am hits tomorrow. Thanks again, I appreciate you With open arms, I would hope! That is what they are there for. Whereabouts are you? Happy to help I moved to southern New Jersey - near Philadelphia. It is nice! I am excited to see what they have in store to help.  Oh well then you may be in range of Eastern PA NHF, which is my old chapter. There are plenty of great HTCs in Philadelphia so it is a great city to be in. Jersey has a Hemophilia Association. Hanj.org they should be able to at least guide u to the right direction.

Thanks so much Not much idea about preimplanting and childs (tho I can say I am a 15 yo w/ severe A who has been 5 years bleed-free even though I am really into Parkour) but I do know about complications during childbirth.\nFemale Hemophiliacs usually get higher levels of FVIII/FIX during pregnancy but a couple days after childbirth it goes down and, at least in my family, that is when heavy bleedings come into play, my mom almost bleed out internally when she was younger.\nSo, that is my warning, if you are not feeling ok a couple of days after birth inmediatly head to the hospital. Just want to add my perspective. I was born in 1994 and have been on prophylaxis my entire life. My quality of life has been great (can count the number of serious bleeds I have had on one hand). Perhaps I am out of the norm, but I would say hemophilia has actually had a positive effect on my upbringing.

Hi, Apologies if I am not using the sub the correct way. Please feel free to remove if so.\n\n I am in the process of getting properly diagnosed and have recently found out through blood tests, that my blood clotting time is very high, suggesting that I either have a bleeding disorder or liver problems (honestly liver issues are not likely). My platelets are totally fine, but we are doing some more tests for my clotting factors.\n\n I have suffered from heavy regular nosebleeds since about age 6 and for several months now I have been having daily nosebleeds, several times a day (sometimes lasting all day if very light). There is no obvious issue with my nose and I tend to bleed/bruise alot anyway, so it is looking likely that I have a bleeding disorder.\n\nHowever, when you read up about bleeding disorders, they always say that women may experience long periods. I do not at all. My periods are extremely heavy (Like blood clots the size of a fist), but they only last 2-3 days and are overall painless. \n\n Does anyone else have bleeding issues without extended periods? Is this possible? Somewhat similar symptoms. Hemophilia B carrier. Most months periods lasted 4-7 days, but sometimes shorter. Terrible nosebleeds growing up. (Vaseline up the nose helps a lot!).

A longer duration is not what I would imagine. I am a woman with hemophilia a and my periods were similar to what you described. I learned I lost as much blood in a day as most women lose in their entire period... So number of days may not correlate with a diagnosis. Yes, sounds like me pre-sorting things. I have von willebrands, nosebleeds is definitely a key thing in my life - I have Kleenex in literally every room of the house and always in my handbag...\nMy periods used to vary between long (7-10days) of moderate.

Was diagnosed at age 18, thanks to my brother. He suffered through 18 eye surgeries (after getting poked in the eye while playing handball in PE) and a serious knee injury where he pushed through every single test (even after our doctor cancelled them). So, we were both diagnosed in the summer of 2015.

Clumsy kid with bruises, daycare thought it was abuse and my father was detained. However, the heavy bleeding after a circumcision following my birth should have been the red flag. They did a bleed test by cutting two incisions on my forearm, one \"open\" and the other \"closed\" and timed the clotting. This was in 1986. Dodged the AIDS outbreak thanks to being prescribed recombinate.  \n\nManaged to be serious injury free for a good 17 years. Then two bouts of severe internal bleeding from stomach ulcers, total knee replacement, having a port implanted due to failing veins and an elbow replacement on the horizon followed by ankle fusions no doubt. Currently 34 years old, working electrical construction. Union benefits are the only way I can afford healthcare (USA) without GHPP. Still working on being healthier. Severe type A hemophilia, diagnosed at birth. With two brothers who died of HIV. Femur fracture, reconstruction of knee, arthropathy in both ankles and tendinitis in left elbow. I have a relatively normal life, I exercise every day (weights and cardio). I am relatively successful in my work (Deputy Director of Credit Risk in a bank). Waiting for two ankle surgeries to improve my quality of life. I am 30 years old and despite living with daily pain, the desire not to die because of this is greater. Diagnosed at birth.  Severe type A. I have a slightly shortened range in my elbow and ankle, but nothing very noticeable.  Ironically, I have broken almost every bone I have at one point or another, had many serious injuries, passed out and fell head-first onto concrete, crashed on my motorcycle, been hit in the face with a bat, and just about any other injury a person can have.  I was a younger brother who tried to keep up with the older kids and disregarded the whole \"Hemophilia\" thing that my mom was always harping on about.  Somehow I have been very lucky in regard to Hemophilia. \n\nUnfortunately, I was no so lucky with the other wonderful things packed into factor in the early 80s, and that is what is caused, and is still causing, real damage to my body.  I am still alive, though, so I guess maybe I am lucky there, too.", "Still waiting on a diagnosis Hey guys, I am not sure if this is the right place for this post, and if not please call me out and tell me where I can go instead if possible. \n\nI am 24F in the UK and in the summer I got some routine bloods done for heavy bleeding and random petechia. My APPT and PT came back slightly raised, so repeats were done and then the results were even more raised. I had my von Willebrand levels tested and they were all fine, so I was referred to haematology and had blood tests 7 weeks ago (17 blood tubes in one sitting!!). They are looking at all the less common clotting factor deficiencies and I have been told not to expect the results until my appointment (1st of Feb). \n\nMy concern is they have not really told me what to expect and what is really happening. The actual words they said to me were \u201cin the meantime do not do any contact sports and try not to get pregnant as you may have a miscarriage and become really poorly\u201d.... which I thought was slightly unprofessional in itself (I have a medical background and know I would never say this to one of my patients!). \n\nI do not know if this is a rant, if it is a plea for more information from people who may have other factor deficiencies, or people who have been through the same long-wait for results. My concern is I should be getting the Covid vaccine through work soon and they would not even do my flu jab as I had to declare I am under investigation for a clotting disorder. My GP said this is beyond their scope and the hospital say I will have to wait for my scheduled appointment before I get any more info. In the meantime I am still here bleeding daily (gynae checks I.e ultrasound and PAP are all fine and contraception has been changed - no change in bleeding so far), hovering over the anaemia border and just feel completely at a loss on what to expect. As far as I know this is not really going to have a huge impact on my life and may just be an underlying thing I have to declare, but no one has told me otherwise. \n\nSorry for the rambling, I am just pulling my hair out here!! Definitely still get the vaccine!! For context: most of us are diagnosed as babies because our clotting disorders are so severe.  So I would assume you have a moderate or mild case. I get vaccines with no issue and I have a very severe bleeding disorder. \nHope that helps!! Wait are you saying you are having menstrual bleeding daily? For how many months have you had daily menstrual bleeding? How are you tracking blood loss?  I would suggest writing down how many completely soaked pads or tampons you go through (write down date and time for tracking purposes) \n\nPersonally I use a menstrual cup as it is easier For me to track blood loss. Most menstrual cups hold 30ml of blood so it is easy for me to say \u201cI have lost 400ml of blood in the last 24 hours\u201d etc etc \n\n\nDiagnosis is much easier if you provide them with DATA but you need to be recording that data for them Document document document! Let us the medical staff do what they need to do with those 17 (holy hell!) vials of blood. You absolutely need to keep track of your bleeding on your own and keep your doctors informed. Maybe eat foods high in Iron? \n\nI dont intend to undermine your knowledge in the medical profession, so if youre already taking the above steps then good on ya. As for the comment about pregnancy, my friends wife suffers from a type of bleeding disorder that occurred twice after child birth, and only after child birth, so I assume that is the angle your docs were going for, just poorly worded.\n\nBest of luck! Near enough every day since April/May, initially put this down to my contraception (Nexplanon) but I came off this for 6 months, had loads of exams and stuff done and everything seemed normal but bleeding continued, now on Kyleena and there is been no change to bleeding. I monitor it all on my Health and Notes apps on my phone and use a combination of all three (pads, tampons and cups) depending on the heaviness which changes daily. Initially I noted down everything but over time the GP seemed less and less interested so now I just note if I am bleeding and whether it is mild, moderate or severe. Everything gynaecology related has essentially been ruled out (as far as I know, I am not really being kept in the loop!) Thank you! I really want and need the vaccine but work will not do it because I am still \u201cunder investigation\u201d and they cannot safely administer it, my GP said it should be fine but do not do it until I am cleared by haematology and they are saying I need to wait until my appointment. I have had so many vaccines, tattoos and piercings (only time I have had bleeding problems from an \u201cexternal\u201d source is post-surgery and post tooth removal) so wish I could just get \u201cyes you can have this vaccine\u201d written in black and white to show work. They did not even let me have the flu jab this year!!! Thank you! \n\nHonestly I have eaten so much spinach and greens (as they have suggested it could perhaps be vitamin K deficiency if not a clotting factor deficiency), I would be surprised if I do not look like Popeye soon!! \ud83d\ude02\n\nLike I said in another comment, I started off documenting a lot but now I just put \u201cbleeding - yes, severity - moderate\u201d on my notes app. I will pick it back up and do it more in depth from now. And with the pregnancy thing, yeah I get why they said it as I know it is currently a grey area as to what is happening, but I think it is a big thing to drop on someone and then go into no further detail!! Thank you for your comment \ud83d\ude03 For flu jab, you need to insist that it is subcutaneous injection to have the best chance to avoid bleeding. I have had a few anything goes flu jabs where nothing happened but also some where it really swelled up. Oh that sounds horrendous! Starting with the simple thing - vaccines are fine, ask for subcutaneous route and press the area afterwards to help minimise bleeding/bruising (always as for a plaster!). Are you being seen by a hospital with a haemophilia treatment centre? Honestly if you are bleeding that much ask for a sooner appointment. Have you tried tranexamic acid? \n\nIt pisses me off that women\u2019s bleeding problems are often not treated as effectively as they good be because \u00ab\u00a0it is just a heavy period\u00a0\u00bb. \n\nI have severe von willebrands and have been on some form of contraception since I was 15 to control my periods, now 40 (last 15 years using mirena pretty successfully). \n\nI really hope you get this sorted, sending a virtual hug I have been waiting over a year to find out i have a factor 11 deficiency but they refuse to diagnose me with anything or treat it. I believe i have hemophilia C. They just keep repeating blood work with the same results, for the past year! Tattoos and piercings?? Ohhhhh youre going to be fine!!!  A single jab from a vaccine will not hurt you I would guess. Fingers crossed the doctor clears you to be able to get it. Im jealous to be honest! My place in line for the vaccine will likely not be until july or August Are you regularly getting your iron checked? That is a lot of bleeding. I am unaware of how the UK health system works but perhaps you just need to keep calling every few days to check in and remind them that you have been bleeding vaginally DAILY FOR EIGHT MONTH! Damn they really need to move faster with this! You deserve better treatment Had my iron checked and it is low enough for me to get symptoms but not so low that it deserves treatment. Officially it is \u201cborderline - no further investigation needed\u201d. My doctor does not seem to really care, saying it is normal for the Nexplanon (even though I have come off of this and gone onto a different contraceptive). No one seems too concerned apart from me!", "Tips for getting a tonsillectomy with hemophilia B Hey everybody,\nThis is my first time posting here. I have severe hemophilia B, and I am scheduled to have my Tonsils removed at the end of March. I was wondering if any of you have been through the experience and have any tips for handling the recovery process.\nThanks!", "April 17 - World Hemophilia Day to Increase Awareness Bleeding Disorders ", "Describe how inside bleeds feel for you I want to see how pain or feelings differ among people in inside bleedings For muscle bleeds (which are more common for me) it basically feels like the muscle is being stretched from the inside, which it is, from the blood. I have only had 1 joint bleed and it was in my shoulder but I could not move my arm because the pain was so bad Im feeling a slight disturbance in my shoulder when i use it somtimes. Little to no pain. Is that bleeding For me, I could not move my shoulder at all. But that is the only joint bleed I have had and since you are severe it would not hurt to get it checked out asap Dam u couldent move it? Also should i go to emergency or just apointment Like i can use it 100% its just theres a small miniscule amount of pain im feeling randomly Joints: Warm, restriction (restricted movement), pain, discomfort and redness \n Skin: swelling, pain ( when disturbed/on contact) (purple patches too!)\n Teeth: pain while chewing and moving the jaw \n Muscles: restriction, warmth, Little to no pain \n Fingers: restriction, swelling and discomfort\n IC: Concussion symptoms and pain ( visit your haematologist asap ) Usualy my left elbow bleeds around 2times a mouth.\n\nIt starts with the joint feeling oily and hot, little pain...for us who had no factor, you get the feeling the party is starting...\nIn 4 to 5 hours it blows up big time, huge sweling, very hot, joint fully locked...you wish that the bleeding stops and your ok, but heck no!...the bleeding continues pressure on the joint is imens, iven the thought of moving hurts like shit...\n\nThen the paint kick's in...massive paint, the kine of pain you remember for years...2days of agony...on the third day the pain reduces slowly...you start with cold water...ice, you start to take of the rap around your neck wicky held your arm for the 3days because your muscles are shit...you get some sleep...but wake up after 3hours because your heart rate slowes and the bleeding starts again, after about 10min walking circles around the room, heart rate goes up, bleeding stops...you go to bed.\n\nAfter 6 days your arm in about 70%healed...and you move on to the next... So i infuse every other day. How long do i gotts wait if it is bleeding. Can i workout my shoulder? To me joint bleeds give pain equivalent to a broken bone, and I cannot use the joint in any capacity for at least a week without excruciating pain. Huh. Ive as far as i know never had joint bleeds cause i cant remember that type of pain. Although i do remember having 1-2 bleeds in my shin after running couple miles and it hurt. I recovered 2 days later though Infuse what? What do you understand from 'no factor'? Oh nvm Listen kid, hemo and contact sport is bad, really bad...to what you want its your life...but in 3years you will be f.....six days till sunday I do not know what severity you are but I am severe so that may be a small cause in difference to recovery time. That said you will know if you ever get a joint bleed. It starts out with general stiffness but after a few hours the pain will be unbearable. Im also severe. But ya ive never experienced Unbearble pain in joints but i have experienced 1-2 muscle bleeds in my life When I had a shoulder bleed it was one of the most painful things I have experienced. I could only lift it halfway.  Limited range of motion is a huge clue to me that I have a bleed... Hot lava, squishy in my joints (feels like the squish of wearing sneakers that are soaking wet), knee joint bleeds feel almost bubbly tingly and painful of course too Even the change of gravity makes me hiss out of pain", "How tf do inside bleeds feel like Im 17 btw. From what ive been told i have hemophilia and sense i was 8 months old i was given factor. I see all these people here saying that bleeding in knees, elbows and such. Like i want to know if the sames happening to me or what cause ive never felt \u201cpain\u201d in my joints. Atleast not yet. I just want to know how bleeds feel for other people or if its a weird feeling altogether. Im just confused, ty in advance What severity do you have?\n\nI have Severe A. My bleeds hurt sometimes, ache sometimes or it is debilitating pain. Elbow bleeds hurt like hell when I try to straighten my arm. They usually throb pretty good, I do not normally get a \"hot\" sensation but I get wicked stiffness in my joint. \n\nOther bleeds, like muscle bleeds, can be difficult. I get them frequently in my forearms and if said part of my arm touches a table or something, it is tender- basically tender to the touch. \n\nBleeds in, say, my fingers are not so bad. That to me is just an ache that will not go away. They take the longest to heal because I do a very hands-on job (coincidentally how I get all the bleeds in my hands and forearms \ud83d\ude05) Severe A and as far as i know i havent had those hard pains in joints like u say. Mabye some aches? But i never really pay attention to those. I workout and if i do have aches they feel similar to sorness Motion is lotion, ya dig? Stay active and take care of your body and you will be better off than me (I am ten years older than you). I get bleeds easily, more so than when I was active in the gym during high school. Be well \ud83e\udd18 Ty. Pls take care. I know now that i got to keep doing exercises to strenthgen my joints so i dont have problems in the future. Or not many problems. I guess it ranges. I have had a ton of bleeds in my joints. Elbows, wrists, ankles, knees, hips, fingers, toes. \n\nFor me the main feelings are swelling, tenderness or pain when using the joint or putting weight on it, pain when transitioning from load bearing to resting, throbbing, warmth, the cartilage in between the articulation points may distend or pop out.\n\nIf it is severe, you will have no question it is a bleed. \n\nIf it is minor and in its first stages it is almost a 6th sense and I just know I have a bleed. Swelling is usually a sign of bleeding into a joint.  Swelling, warm/hot to the touch, reduced motion, and sometimes discomfort or absolute unbelievable pain depending on the bleed and previous damage to the joint.  The pain usually comes after you have had a lot of bleeds into a joint.  Every bleed, large or small damages the joint and the damage accumulates for your entire life.  Do not think ignoring something is a good idea because it does not hurt now.  We all would love to go back in time and treat a little sooner or more often or take better care of ourselves.  Eventually it all catches up with you. Swelling, pain, stiffness, heat (the area will feel warmer to the touch). You will know if you have a bleed. And if you do, stay off of it until it is completely better, maybe even a day or two after , if it is a joint bleed. That was you will avoid as much damage as possible. Dam. As far as i know ive never felt that. I do have suden irritations somtimes but that is it Bleed? The area with a bleed will be swollen, slightly reddish and warm. Movement will be restricted as you will be unable to bend fully. If it is a bad one, the pain will be so bad that you will be unable to sleep. Bleeds usually start with a fuzzy, tingly feeling, then the pain and usually an inability to move the joint. You can learn more about bleeds and Hemophilia here: HemoTalk.tk", "Treatment infrastructure Hello brethren, as the title suggests I would love to hear how you guys get your treatment and what process you go through to get it. For Example, the only way to get factor therapy in India is by 3 means:\n1) you can buy and administer it yourself, but that is expensive as hell.\n\n2) certain govt approved hospitals alloted budget to buy the drug but the stock is almost too little to administer to everyone and it takes a lot of time to get it restocked to due to bureaucracy and red tapism.\n\n3) if you are a govt servant you are part of a govt approved program where you get the treatment for any ailment without any extra cost, I come under this one, and one of the few fortunate ones to get ample doses.\n\nI am trying to find out how things are different in other countries so that I can help others by taking this fight to the courts and help countless others who are deprived of good treatment. Greetings my brother from another mother,\n\n1. I reside in U.S.A\n2. Am under the medical program: Medicaid, based on low-income which approves 95% of medications including Factor\n3. I receive 3 month supply of Factor 8 as well as Hemlibra\n4. I have been administering it myself since I was the age of 14\n5. It is indeed very expensive without Insurance coverage even in the states. Black market value for Factor shows ~3K USD Hello brother, I too reside in India but I can assure you that you are missing another point.\n\nThe government of Gujarat has made Factor VIII FREE for Haemophilic patients, it is just hard to convince the hospitals to get it on a prophylactic basis. My family had to spend some time but in the end I get my doses and they go out of stock only a few times. I also have a 10-20k units with me for emergency purposes. Hey 32m factor 8 deficiency live in the United States. I learned how to self infuse at a hemophilia camp when I was like 8. As far as getting and paying for my medicine, it varies obviously but this is my experience. I have had private insurance since I was 18 years old. Private employer insurance is typically the best insurance you can have in the US. Since factor is so expensive I can tell you health insurance does not cover much if anything for hemophilia. Instead, and I am not 100% sure for every state, but most states all people with hemophilia have to sign up for some form of medicaid which is government run insurance and they cover it. We call a pharmacy over the phone and it comes to our door. From the UK;\n\nI have been self infusing at home since I was about 15, I get my treatment and any extras (sharps bins, smaller plasters, cotton pads) delivered to my house every 12 weeks. I get a phonecall on week 11 asking what I do or do not need and then pick a date for delivery the following week.\n\nIt is all free due to the NHS, I obviously just pay tax / national insurance on my earnings. The supreme court had ruled in favor of people with genetic disorders to adequate cover a few years ago. Unfortunately, that order has not been enforced. No insurance company still offers insurance cover of any sort.\n\n Certain states offer it under certain plans like the employee state insurance, etc. Others offer it at a state government healthcare facility, which would be a challenge to go to during say, a psoas bleed. \n\nI do not even want to get started with the challenges now with COVID going on. \n\nBest wishes with whatever you are planning. But it is a long journey. Do not give up. Hello bro, the \"FREE\" part you are talking about is true for majority of hospitals in India, the city I live in, Prayagraj, has 2 major hospitals which gets funds for this particular drug and is offered to patients at no extra cost too, right now though, it is a completely other story as patients are being turned away due to covid priorities. The catch is getting injected within time and minimum hassle, like you said, it is hard to convince hospitals to get everyone on prophylaxis, which is true, because the demand exceeds supply. I know one of the activists or should I say a leech who cashes on people like us, but whatever he may be, he is the closest to being someone who was vocal for free treatment, as for th covid one, it is actually very embarrassing, the medical college in my city is telling people to go to lucknow to get their treatment and have also made it quite clear that they are a part of the surplus crowd.\n\nI will not say the order from the court has not been implemented, because technically it has been, but not at a scale where it would have been effective. The budget that gets sanctioned is like alms and is always too little and too late, the problem I see is that even with millions of patients throughout India why is it not treated as a disease with priority like cancer and diabetes?.\n\nThe biggest hurdle is insurance, if somehow it was a part of the disease that are included in the charter, it would not had been so much of a worry. From what I know and please correct me if I am wrong,the Insurance in India excludes all genetic disorders and any disease which occurs naturally by birth?\n\nThank you for your wishes, I am still clueless as to how will I go about it, that is why I am still researching and gathering every Information I can, stay safe brother. U.K. &amp; France - no restrictions on amount of factor needed and fully paid for by the state. Plasma derived, recombinant standard &amp; long acting FVIII and hemlibra approved for use. (All free). \n\nFor prophylaxis you usually get monthly supplies in France. Self injection is basically when you are ready to/want to, but they also will arrange for a nurse to come and give it at home if needed. Wow, sounds like ours is lagging 30 years behind. So as for the nurse part, what role do they play? I mean, are they your first point of contact for all the queries? And trained to assist in all sorts of situations?. Happy to hear that atleast your state does not make you jump through hoops to stay alive, stay safe brother, thanks for the info. No - more like if you do not want to infuse - they always offer it to me because I only use prophy occasionally (have severe VWD). But if parents of kids did not want to they would also offer it. Hey bro, really appreciate the information and I hope you are healthy and doing well. So from what I can collect, it is that a certain percentage is paid for by the govt or insurance agency and the rest is bourn by you, would you say that their contribution is significant or better than none at all?. \n\nAs for the self infusion part, I got to learn it in quite an interesting circumstance, I used to be dependent on my doctor for getting the doses but that meant, sometimes waiting for hours in his clinic, out of spite for depending on him for something so trivial one day (2014, @ 23 years of age) I just nicked myself and after a dozen or so tries, found the right way....I wish I had a training like that, but oh well, good to hear that bro. Well I would not question their judgement I get complacent with my infusions too. In my experience, employer-sponsored private health insurance **does** cover most of the cost for hemophilia treatment.  But keep in mind that the private health insurance itself can also be expensive.  \n\nMedicaid is a federal government insurance program but it is administered by the states.  So states have some latitude in determining how the program works.  As far I know, there are income limits for Medicaid eligibility.  An ( from 2018 said:\n&gt; Nationwide, a third of adults and children living with hemophilia are covered by Medicaid.\n\nBut the bottom line is that the US health insurance system is an often confusing patchwork of federal and state laws and regulations that leads hemophilia patients to have to navigate public and private health insurance plans, drug manufacturer patient assistance programs, hospital and pharmacy financial assistance programs and nonprofit third-party financial assistance programs. From Romania\n\n1. Under 18years old, you get factor 8 prophilactic, dont know what amount.\n2.

I have to prove every 2years to the state that I still have hemophilia.....yup you read that right!", "Recent Factor X deficiency diagnosis - mixed emotions and rant! (Long) I feel like I need to rant and rave in a safe space, although my condition is very mild.\n\nSo at the grand old age of 25, after 10 years of complaining to my GP about heavy menstrual periods, excessive bruising and all sorts of health professionals telling me \u201coh, you are a bleeder are not you!\u201d, I finally have my diagnosis. \n\nEach test my GP performed PT and APPT have been prolonged, and I was referred to a Haemotology clinic last year. After about 40 blood tests in total and each appointment being rescheduled at least twice due to covid and other reasons, I had a  phone call from a registrar at my hospital. He said all my factor assays were fine, VW was low end of normal but fine and my PT/APPT were not significantly prolonged. He said he is just going to do one more coag blood test and then discharge me. He also said to me \u201cyou are not even anaemic at the moment so I do not think your bleeding is as bad as you think\u201d. Told me that if he took a sample of women my age, 80% would have the symptoms I am describing and in his own words, \u201cit is a known female thing\u201d. \n\nWell, this left me reassured but kind of bummed out at the same time as I just wanted to know what was wrong. I have a lot of family history of heavy bleeding, including an uncle who passed away in his 20s from a spontaneous haemorrhagic stroke, so I wanted to be certain everything was fine. \n\nI had my further coag screen and had another telephone appointment last week. It was a different doctor, a locum consultant. He said they have finally narrowed down which factor was to blame - Factor X. He said it is a very rare condition that he has little knowledge on, and he would have to refer me onto the specialist haemophilia centre. I was reassured that my levels are only that of a very mild deficiency (50%, normal ranges 77-131%), but significant nonetheless. I mentioned that at my last appointment I was told all factors were fine, and he said that was absolutely not the case. \n\nI now have very mixed feelings about this diagnosis. Yes, I am happy it is finally been recognised as an abnormality as opposed to multiple doctors over the years telling me there is nothing wrong with me. Also, looking over my previous blood test results from a teen, my PT/APPT were prolonged there too and nobody thought to tell me. However, I am harbouring this guilt that actually, the deficiency is only mild and I am making a big deal of nothing. I am having a bit of imposter syndrome about being referred to the centre. And quite honestly, I am worried. \n\nDespite having no serious complications in previous surgeries/extractions/piercings/tattoos etc (except the whole, \u201cwow you are a bleeder!), I am now having to really put things on hold. My work will not allow me to have a flu vaccine in-house, I may have to delay potential upcoming knee surgery following injury, and I am also having to put on hold my plans to start a family. \n\nI do not even know if anyone has made it to the end, I think I just really needed a rant. My friends and family are great but most do not know - although my immediate family are likely going to have to all be tested now too, especially as my kid sister has some bleeding tendencies too. My partner does not know how to react, as I reassure him it is mild and nothing to worry about, while hiding some panic myself. And I do not want him to google stuff and worry. I am also now scared I cannot give him a family he really wants. \n\nThank you for being a shoulder to cry on (or a forum to rant on!) At least the mystery is gone and you can focus on the correct course of action. If mild you may be able to get by with on demand treatments.  Good luck. Hey! Welcome! It is a known and unfortunate fact that women have a harder time getting diagnosed than men\u2026 being dismissed by doctors and not taken seriously. I am a woman with hemophilia and I have experienced this. The good news is that there are others! Here is a ( just for women bleeders. Hemophilia Federation of America\u2019s symposium is going on ( and is fully online and free. Also, you can 1000% still have a family. Like no question you can. And if you have any questions, please feel free to DM me! Welcome to the club nobody wants to be in! Factor 10 deficiency is pretty rare; I only know a few guys that have it, and no girls I am aware of. Feel free to post here anytime you have a question or need support. You will not get a ton of responses, but there is always a few bleeders checking here. We are a supportive and empathetic group. \n\nIf there is no known family history, mild hemophiliacs often find out later in life when they get a surgery or have an accident. Us with severe usually have family with it or find out pretty early in life. I imagine it can be overwhelming to learn all this new stuff and it will make you question the future or whatever. Just remember that your body is the same it has always been, you just have a bit more information and understanding of it now. \n\nThere is a lot of genetics stuff I want to mention, but I do not want to overwhelm you too much.

Bring on my subcutaneous factor. \n\nThe 'daily' part would suck, though. Not sure if I would prefer that over my 10-day duration half-life factor. \n\nWonder how they are going sourcing eligible gene therapy candidates. Seems to me that quite a lot of us have been involved in gene therapy trials now, which makes us all ineligible for these future ones. Us severe FIX guys with no inhibitors were rare enough to begin with. I agree that the daily part does seem daunting.  Although near the end of the poster they do say:\n&gt; The prolonged half-life and stable high levels of FIX activity have the potential to allow for less frequent dosing\n\nAs far as finding trial candidates, I think there is a fairly large percentage of hemophilia patients who are hanging back because they are not yet sold on gene therapy.  At least that is the impression I have gotten from people working on some GT trials.  As a result, hopefully, there are still plenty of people available for a more conventional trial such as this one. That would be cool if this pans out!

Assuming IV", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Joints Over Time in Boys With Severe Hemophilia A ", "Can someone help me understand the typical factor levels for type A carriers? So I have factor XIII deficiency (&lt;1%) and have known about it all of my life. Diagnosed by umbilical cord bleeding at birth. It is pretty manageable, but my husband and I are currently trying to conceive so I have been going through a lot of tests and doctors appointments.\n\nMy last blood draw got screwed up in the lab and they ran my FVIII levels instead of FXIII. They came back at 39% and I am honestly really shocked and have no idea what to make of that.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge there is literally no way that FXIII deficiency should cause a drop in FVIII. My only other thought is that I am potentially a carrier of type A. However, I feel like the chances being an FVIII carrier and having FXIII deficiency are next to impossible... \n\nI have been trying all day to remember if I have ever had FVIII levels checked before now, but I honestly do not think I have. \n\nI have already got repeat labs and a follow up appointment setup, and I am working on scheduling genetic carrier testing. I am just really confused, so I was wondering if anyone could offer some insight into the 39% result and if this is a cause for concern. Do low or out of range levels automatically indicate carrier or could it be a coincidence? Get the repeat labs and go from there.  I once got a factor VIII test back that said I had 63% activity and I have &lt;1% in reality. No lab is infallible and some of the factor activity labs are particularly subject to human error. There are also multiple types of FVIII assays with varying levels of accuracy and contraindications. Traditional one stage FVIII assays are susceptible to disturbances in FIX, FXI and FXII levels but as far as I know are not impacted by FXIII since FXIII is a separate coagulation pathway from FVIII. However, not a doctor. A modern chromagenic FVIII assay would be best to rule out interactions and isolate FVIII from the other factors. This article found that the mean factor VIII for carriers was 60%, while mean factor for non carriers was 102%:\n\n Thanks so much for your response! That actually helps clear something up for me. Using the same sample it appears they did both a standard activity and a chromogenic. The standard was 60% the chromogenic was the 39%. I was thinking the chromogenic would be more accurate, but was not completely sure. \n\nShould I request the chromogenic again for the next round of testing? And is it possible the 60 had some interference?\n\nI definitely think the additional testing is going to help understand the results. Labs are set for June 4th. I had to wait until the half life on my FXIII infusion would be low enough to test my current dose. Thank you! Will definitely read through, looks like a good resource. Accuracy is suspect on either test. But the chromagenic is less susceptible to interference from other factors. I think \"normal\"  range for both is something like 55% to 200%. Personally I would request that both assays be reperformed to eliminate confusion. \n\nIn regards to your carrier status, I do not think FVIII levels can be used with any certainty. Genetic testing is the way. Presumably the FXIII is also heritable, though it is less well understood. I would want to talk to a genetic counselor prior to having kids just to discuss that anyway. Will do on requesting both tests for the next round of levels! I will be curious to see how everything compares.\n\nLuckily we have already been working with a genetic counselor because of the FXIII deficiency. The FXIII gene is actually non sex linked recessive, so my husband is the one who needs the genetic testing for that one. I am fairly confident our dr will be willing to order FVIII for me though. Unfortunately, my hematologist said they can only do levels not genetic testing. Just an FYI that if a woman has fviii levels below 50 she should be diagnosed with mild hemophilia and not as a carrier or symptomatic carrier.", "How long does helimbra last Just wondering how long helimbra last and what % of factor does it give you throught the hole time Not possible to answer this question. \n\nBut generally, hemlibra is dosed to either once a week or every other week. Factor level is messy, because hemlibra is not actually factor VIII. But you should not be experiencing spontaneously bleeds, or bleeds from minor injuries if you are using it correctly. What the dose is will depend on your weight and (I presume) the severity of your hemophilia. The half-life period for himlibra is 30 days, means to consume half the quantity it needs 30 days, but Roche recommends weekly dose. Lets say a normal person has 100% healinng. What % would a severe hem A have with helimbra You do not understand, if you take 100 ml hemlibra, 50 ml is consumed in 30 days that is half life, next 25 ml will take 30 days, and for your information hemlibra does not increase your factor lvl, it creates new antibody by combining factor 9 and factor 10, the antibody is similar to factor 8, that is why when on hemlibra factor 8 test comes as 60% or 80% I am currently on Hemlibra and dosage is 1x per week (Monday for me). It is a building block for Hemophiliacs. We will have 30% of Factor VII throughout the entire week which is enough for daily activities. I have been on it for the past 6 months and cannot complain. However, when I feel there is more inflammation than normal or an injury, I use Advate to bring my levels back up to 100%. So far no complaints.\n\nEdit1: I do not give prophylaxis any longer which is a +. Reason is due to not being as active(no sports of any kind but I do exercise frequently(strength training/mobility).", "Arthritis achievements To rule out any surgery options I updated imaging on my right elbow after 8 years (been highly arthritic for 10).  I have been actively rehabilitating the arm for the last 4 months and it feels relatively great compared, but here is where it gets fun.\n\nThe ortho looking at my x-ray/mri/ct scan says while I am seriously bone on bone, it seems that I have continued to carve away at bone in order to create a smoother clearance inside the elbow.  He was impressed and confused and kind of horrified.  \n\nThe other side of it is that there is not any joint space left (surprise), so we would need to do an open surgery if one were required rather than an arthroscopic.  The good news being that there is not a surgery to be done to assist my joint mid arc at the moment, just strengthening the muscles around it.\n\nI feel proud of this because my arm feels better than it has in a decade, and I feel like I have bought myself a lot of comfort if not more time until a proper intervention needs to be done. Awesome! Glad you are improving. Elbow bleeds are the worst. I feel for you. I had a bad ankle for the first 30 years of my life. Really bad. Then I had an emergency surgery because i got a staff infection in it, and I could have lost my foot. After the surgery and 6 months of healing , it was better. Like new. It did not hurt anymore and I can walk anywhere, like normal. Talk about luck. I got most of my motion back too. It is still not perfect but I cannot believe how much better it is. That was 15 years ago now, and my health has only improved. I can do things I never could before. So it is possible to heal up beyond what you though you could. It truly is.  I have not had a bleed in my elbow in a year and this is the first time in my life I could say that What is your rehab regimen? Good question.  A lot of manual resistance exercises to strengthen the muscles around the elbow as well as graston.  \n\nResistance training with thera bands has been my godsend as they also let me stretch out in them and you really cannot overdo them in an idea situation.  Deltoid raises at different angles as well as bicep curls with Thera bands have been what got me past the first deeply uncomfortable sessions In my mid teens my ankles felt like walking on broken glass.  By my mid 20s the pain started to subside and of course my flexibility was nearly zero but the pain was manageable and  it long after, the everyday/every step pain was gone.  I am sure we feel it the most at the end of the joint cartilage and eventually blow through the nerve endings to find a manageable level of discomfort.  Glad you you have found some relief in whatever form.  Anything is better than temporary, surgical relief that needs to be performed every 8-10 years. We are amazing and horrifying people.  I am glad I could enlighten an orthopedist to our side show Cautionary story. \nMy elbow was pretty much like yours.  The humorous has carved a nice groove into the ulna.  Elbow was much better than when it first started.  Things were good for 10 years.  One day everything changed.  Elbow started to bleed but it was different than other joint bleeds.\n\nMy ulna grew bone spurs which started to slice into my muscle evertime I moved.  There was no joint so the blood just kept going into my forearm.  It would never completely heal and was not able to bend my arm for days.  Even the slightest bit of resistance would send ungodly pain in my arm.  Plus it got to the point that I had to treat every 24 to 36 hrs or it would bleed like clock work since the spurs continued to slice my muscle.  I endured this for more than 6 months.  My poor veins where shot especially since I was limited to certain locations bc of the elbow bleed.  Had to keep my elbow and forearm wrapped with a tensor to help keep the bleeding done. \n\nGood news is that had surgery to remove the spurs and everything is back to normal or at least my normal. Waiting for the next thi g's to go wrong.  Worried one day my bone will just snap when the groove gets deep enough. I share that worry about snapping the bone.  Thank you for the cautionary tale because While I am leagues better I am very much ill at ease.  Hopefully Hemlibra helps keep it managed The one thing I learned through the ordeal is that hemophiliacs' arthritic joints are much different than the general population.  Not all orthopedic surgeons understand this.  I was there was nothing that could be done, that I needed a replacement or fusion.  In the end it was a simple surgery that did not even require a hospital stay and was back to work after 2 days off.\n\nI have the use it or lose it philosophy so I dont want to be downer just to keep an eye out.  Also probably a good idea to take some Vit D and calcium to keep the bone strong.", "Eye bleed? It has been quite a long time since I had an eye bleed. basically half the white of my eye is red. I had already given Factor VIII to raise it above 80% yesterday and gave it a few sterile eye drops (no medication).\n\nShould I take tranexamic acid as well? Contact your hematologist or HTC I would say it is not a big deal. Something like that takes a tiny amount of blood to make it look super bad. If it is not swollen or continuing to bleed just keep yourself above 30% or so for until it resolves and I would think it will be fine. Scary tho huh? Bleeds suck, especially ones in unusual places. I am tapa a severe and have never taken tranexamic acid. We had something called amicar for mouth bleeds (teeth, nose bleeds...) but it does not seem to be used anymore. As long as you have factor in you you should heal as anyone would. Does 30% means raise it to that amount at infusion time or keep jabbing to ensure it does not dip below that amount?\n\nI increased it to 90% when I first noticed the bleed 2 days ago and going by the halflife should have about 12.25% or less left now since I am moderately severe but bleed like severe according to the bleeding frequency chart.\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nEach vial I have raises my factor by about 30% and I googled hemophilia eye bleed which said do 80%.\n\n I would keep it above (about) 30% until you are sure it is not bleeding anymore, or at risk of re bleeding. Usually a week or so for bad bleeds. But that is if like, you hurt your foot walking, and your going to need to walk, or you hurt your hand writing, and your going to have to write. But if you did something like injured yourself , and you are not likely to do it again, then it is not going to be at risk for bleeding as much, right? So since it is your eye, which sounds like a spontaneous thing, or a broken blood vessel from sneezing or whatever, I would think you will not re injure it as easily. Unless it is really aggravated and swollen, and looking around hurts, then in that case stay above 30% or so until it is not aggravated. I am extra cautious because I do not like having lasting damage to my body, and because I have access to factor. So you know what you are capable of. But if it is something like your eye, you need those, and if it just means infusing every other day for a couple of weeks, do that. I think people should infuse every few days anyway if they can, because it actually ends up costing around the same if you are severe, at least in my case it does. I use Hemlibra now so things are different, but that is what I had to do. And if I had a weird bleed like you are having I would just infuse more, or more often, depending on how I was doing. But now with Hemlibra I am at about a constant 30% (in Hemlibra terms) so because I have been stable for a while with no bleeds I am stronger and injuring myself less, and also do not have spontaneous bleeds like your eye things sounds like it is. Anyway, yea just keep infusing every other day till it is better enough to not worry you, and you will be fine. It is really hard to OD one factor 8. The stories about that are usually people who were factor 9 bleeders and only had factor 8 to stop bleeds, so they had to take more and could overclott and have a heart attack. But it is not an issue for hemophilia A. Unless you really mess up and do like 5 times as much as you should. So it is ok if the Factor level goes above 100%? That was something the doctors and nurses had ever talked about. Yea it will not hurt you.

But we he stand he says it hurts and do not rest on it. Should we substitute him or wait to see if it gets better ?  Deffo treat him and then take him to the hospital if it does not improve. Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. Keep him off his feet, ice pack on the knee (for not more than 15 minutes at a time), put a compression wrap/bandage on it for another 15 minutes at a time, and keep his knee elevated, above heart level if possible, I know toddlers are hard to keep still but that is the only treatment options I know Call your Hemophilia Treatment Center. They know your son\u2019s unique situation and can tell you the best course for him- infusion, hospital visit, wait and see, etc. It did not get worse, but not better. He seems to be alright. If it was a little severe, it should have expanded, right ? And I could not bend it without him feeling pain ? (It is not bleeding and there is no wound) They are not the best...and he never been infused. If I can I better avoid it... Yes and no, joint bleeding does not always swell up to crazy levels, the main point of treating bleeds early is to prevent permanent joint damage, even minor bleeds that take more than a day to clear up, contribute towards permanent cumulative damage to joint cartilage, and the knees are target joints for most people with hemophilia. \n\n\nWhen I was a child, access to meds was not always consistent so there has been some permanent damage done to a few of my joints but I escaped rather unscathed, both my knees are in great shape and I had maybe one bleed into either of them, that I remember... I would say keep an eye on it and ring your haemotologist or local hemophilia centre (if you have one) and ask their advice is he scared of needles refuses to be infused? or did you not learn how to infuse? No offense meant, but I am going to give you a dose of reality.\n\nYou have an obligation to your son to ensure he gets the best care. That means if you do not know what to do, calling the treatment center. 12% is not enough to heal an injury. I take hemlibra to keep me at about 20% and I still need to infuse with factor if I have any kind of injury. \n\nAs far as home treatment go with RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation). He should not put weight on it until it is better.\n\nEvery bleed will do perm ant damage and to be blunt, you do not want him having a target joint, or with bad osteoarthritis when he is a teen or in his 20s like I had.\n\nCall the treatment center and if he needs an infusion, get him one. We are going to the hospital. I start to freak out now, I hope I did not wait too long... Absolutely treat him. Blood in joints causes damage to the joint. Which may mean he will have recurring bleeds (spontaneous possibly) in that target joint or damage and pain later in life. Medicine is too good and available these days to not take it. You may want to consider learning how to infuse and keeping a dose or two at home in case of emergencies. Good man. No reason to freak out, just do the best you can. Go to events, talk to other hemos and hemo parents. \n\nIf you manage his health well, he can absolutely have a fantastic life. I am 34 and am lucky enough to not have any joint replacements (yet, but could use a new left knee) and no narcotic addictions because I never really had to take them. I got exposed to HCV through blood products but my body killed it (no virus ever found).\n\nYou will need to learn to infuse him so you can give him one immediately if something happens. You might want to ask about prophylaxis treatment in general. Although I will say hemlibra is the shit for me... life changing. I infused 4 times a week basically the last 30 years and now I do 3 injections once a week and I have no bleeds now.\n\nTake a deep breath, everything will be fine. Thank you. I will learn as soon as I can... You will get the hang of it. Do not worry. Just learn from experience, talk to other parents and bleeders by attending your local Hemophilia events. Do you have any other bleeders in your family? His cousin. Update: we just get back from hospital. He had an echography: there was not any liquid in the knee. Then he was infused anyway. It was for the first time: the nurse tried on the right hand first, she did not succeed so she made it on the left after; my boy was very courageous. 10 minutes after they told us to go home: I am a little surprised as it is the first time, I hope there cannot be complications. Thanks everyone for your advices and good words. Happy New year, may you be healthy. Treat Even when doctors say there is t swelling , there usually still is enough to do damage. I have been in to the ER many times with pretty bad bleeds that the doctors who were not familiar with hemophilia said were not swollen or what they call a hematoma. But it was bad enough for me to need to rest for days. Make sure your son does not put weight on it until it is better. Do not push him to \u201cwalk it off\u201d , like a lot of people will suggest for people without hemophilia. When there is swelling, even if it is not still bleeding, the swelling will do damage to the joint. So make sure he is not walking on it until he is ready. If it hurts, do not walk. If it is swollen and stiff, do not walk. He will save himself so much trouble in the future if he learns this while he is young. Hemophiliacs do great with a lot of activities , but when a bleed happens it is important to baby it. Best of luck, take care. Thanks for the update. Glad your boy is okay. I would definitely recommend seeing if your local hemophilia foundation has a summer camp. It would be great for him to go when he is older. \n\nInfusions suck, flat out. Big ups to him for being brave and doing it. I still hate them despite being pretty proficient by now for self infusing. \n\nAnyway I do not want to overwhelm you with info when you have already had a rough day. Glad he is doing well, and good in you for getting him there and taken care of! I know it can be very scary the first time your child has a bleeding episode. There have been studies with joint bleeds and small ones that do not get detected (called 'micro bleeds') that can cause lasting damage. When I was 4, I developed a target joint (my elbow), because I was too scared to tell my parents that I was bleeding. Please be careful in how you react to your child telling you something is wrong. My parents were new to Canada and working long hours, and I knew that telling them I was hurt, meant they had to miss work. It was a lot of stress on a 4 year old child. I also want to say that reaching out to forums and chats with other bleeders is a great thing! I know you care and you are doing your best. You and your child are going to be okay! Thank you. We do not have summer camp here. The hemophilia treatment center is basically 2 doctors and a nurse in an hospital. Sometimes they say something, and an other time they say the opposite. I also have been yelled at for asking questions. Reddit is my main source of information. I read all the threads here, it is very helpful. And people are really nice most of the time. Thank you. Yes. That is what I was planning to do. Thank you. I think everyone has covered the joint damage stuff, but I just wanted to say there is not much reason to avoid giving medication.\n\nAlmost all factor manufacturers will pay for your out-of-pocket costs. So you should not worry about the finances.\n\nThere is a small chance of developing an inhibitor which is like your body rejecting the medicine, but then there are a bunch of other medicines that can be taken.\n\nAnd even if a bleed did not cause permanent damage, giving medication will speed up his recovery. I know many parents want their sons to live normal lives and be active and everything. Using medication does not stop that, but instead helps it. I know all that. But many people here are quite incompetent. Nobody talks each other, we have to explain everything to everyone each time. They do not know how to make a shot, many are like afraid, and it is an hospital specialized with children...They do not have basic stuff like toys to distract them while doing it, they do not have any specific methods like I do not know, playing music, singing, anything. The mortality rate is too high in there and errors are too frequent.When I go there, I am afraid. If I can avoid it, I avoid it. I thought (wrongly) that it could be harmless. Now everything seems to be okay. Thanks to everyone. Definitely scary when you cannot trust your own hospital or HTC. I am a severe and my parents used to make weekly drives an hour away because they did not trust our hospital. If your hospital is trying to look out for their own ass, I wonder if there are short phlebotomy courses you can take to do learn how to do it yourself.\n\nI had a port in my chest when I was younger so my parents could easily infuse me, but that got infected after a short time. I learn as soon as I can. Is Hemlibra available where you are?  With that you would only have to do SUBQ injections instead of IV. No it is not :/ Update 2: He has to have his leg immobilized for 7 days and take Exacyl. I agree with all this. Waiting to treat adds up in terms of joint damage. By 50 I had two destroyed ankles, needed knee replacements, and have a left elbow that can barely lift 20 pounds without swelling. If he is in pain, he is having a bleed.

My ankle is a bit shot cuz I was a dumb kid, but my quality of life has not been affected much.\n\nI do not wish to mitigate/ignore/downplay the impact that Hemophilia has on people, especially folks who were around when the treatment options were not as advanced. I guess the younger generation is blessed to not have gone through what you have gone through.  To answer your PS, yes, hematologists will, not uncommonly, deny that a woman can have hemophilia. My sister has visited multiple hematologists in a huge New England metro area, will have factor assay levels come back below normal and talk about her issues bleeding especially after surgery, tell them that her brother has hemophilia, and yet they still will not even try something like desmopressin for her. The farthest they will go is \"symptomatic carrier.\" It is frustrating. how the do they justify the below normal level? They do not. They just keep taking the levels until eventually the reading goes up even slightly and they say it is acute and not chronic.  huh, but surely there are enough reported incidence of woman with hemophilia, arn't there? You would think so. I would say it is about 50/50 in my area for doctors, including hematologists, who would say women can have hemophilia. If she had vwd I am sure it would not be a problem to get proper treatment but when it comes to VIII and IX deficiencies some are just set in their ways. huh, they cannot imagine the possibility that somebody gets two shitty X chromosome? damn. that is got to be annoying.\n\nHopefully you guys found one that will recognize that women can get hemophilia. I would not even know how to respond to someone with this viewpoint. It is baffling.\n\nI grew up w/ other hemophiliacs, when to hemophilia camps. Went through major hurdles with my ankles and hemophilia did definitely define what my childhood was like. I lost a hemophiliac uncle to HIV. \n\nBut damn, its not my identity, nor is it a culture I am part of. It is a blood disorder. Yes, and honestly I am glad the younger generation has not. I dont wish it on anyone.\n\nI was tormented through school for my hemophilia, outcast, ppl thought I had AIDS like Ryan, no one talked to me. I was put in a corner in the back, not allowed to do anything for fear of bleeding to death by the school. My cousin dropped out bc he could not take it. Id have to walk to school on crutches, sometimes a wheelchair. We had windows smashed over AIDS fear, fellow employees would gang up on my parents at work bc their premiums were raised due to me or insurance companies would outright cancel company insurance. My parents had to work 2 jobs a piece.\n\nMy uncle bled to death from his Hemophila when I was in kindergarten. I had my 1st surgery in 4th grade bc my elbow was shot. I had a 2nd at on my elbow at 17, it is still shot. My ankles have fused from damage and have no range of motion. Had my knee replaced at 21, my hip replaced at 28, just saw my surgeon about replacing my replaced knee, severe arthritis in many joints. My cousin, and 2 friends with Hemophilia are in a similar boat. Which isnt even as bad as some of the older men I run into at the charity events and confrences.\n\nI have never had a family doctor bc many in my area wont even see me. They are too afraid of something happening and getting sued. Hell after 20 yrs I finally got a dentist last week to see after I hid my hemophilia. They found out though.. first thing he said was \"Wow, I didnt know there was ppl with hemophilia out there.\" Then proceeded to shake as he was looking in my mouth constantly asking me if was going to cause bleeding.\n\nMy HTC and I started a mens group yrs back. Its finally grown to a good size, we go do a lot of stuff. The differences between mine and previous generations, and the younger ones can be big. Some still have issues, but not as many. It makes me happy tbh and I am glad so many have it easier :) The problem is this identity is being embraced by the parents of patients, as though being a parent to a former hemophiliac would make them less special. I have never seen any hemophilia parents in real life feel special for having a child with hemophilia. Not saying there arent, there probably are a few, but it is literally one of the most expensive diseases out there. So most parents have to stay poor to provide their children with gov't healthcare.\n\n You see it all the time in the big Facebook group. Parents wrap that shit around them like a safety blanket. I would agree with this...from what I see in the UK a big problem now regarding haemophilia being such an instilled part of a persons identity is due to the way parents behave. I see some take it in their stride, deal with it amazingly whilst also encouraging their kids to get out there and be \"normal\"...however there are those that just live in the facebook groups where haemophilia has clearly become a dominant theme in their life and they end up imprinting it on their kids...and these end up being the kids who have tricky independence issues as teens later on...something I experience a lot as a volunteer at youth camps Saying that someone can get fucked for not having the same view as you is pretty dense.  I personally would not cure my Hemophilia. I would hope that my kids and grandkids could enjoy life with the cure but at this point Hemophilia is a part of me. If you would have asked me in my early 20s I would have said take this shit I do not want it. But to reiterate a point made previously, it is made me who I am. Some of my closest friends, and best opportunities have come from it. Now do not get me wrong, I think the whole \u201cchurch camp\u201d vibe that some people give off about it is definitely fucked up. But for some of us it is just become a part of what we do and who we are on a daily basis. I do not look at people who want to be cured and judge them....we all got our reasons.  Yeah you are stuck in a confined past. To the commune with you! Haha. It is not my past I am siding with, it is the present. My past is full of \u201cfuck Hemophilia\u201d , right now I volunteer and talk to new families as much as possible. I do talks, and host groups to help other bleeders. 5 years ago I would have laughed at the thought.  In 10 years I may feel different. At this point it is all hypothetical.

I got hem 8 A Just wondering if there some sorta process to switching to helimbra or if its just\u201dthe next day i can start\u201d. Got To ask a doctor When I did the clinical trial, they had me take factor for maybe a couple times after my first Hemlibra dose because it did take time for the levels to build up from 0, but once your levels are sustainable you are good (although you should always keep a few doses of your 'regular' factor around in case of emergency).\n\nYou will also probably start with weekly doses and then as you get more comfortable you can switch to biweekly or monthly. Ty bro I started 2 years ago; it was an easy transition. I have Hem A severe and have not had to supplement with any on demand (Advate) medicine. I take it every other week and it has been amazing. Isnt it like 40% effective as normal factor. Do you need to be more careful or limit yourself more. Or just go about your day? If dosed correctly it should be perfectly fine in my opinion. I have had a better experience using Hemlibra than Adynovate (what I used before). I have never been SUPER active (a 26 year old male) so my life is basically the same but with many fewer injections. I have a brother with the same condition and he has had the same experience as me switching to Hemlibra. Ty brother Sure thing. I highly recommend! It has bettered my life so much. It was an easy transition that only required me to go to my HTC and learn how to take it. Never used anything else since. It is not difficult, but you do have to take maintenance doses for the first 4 weeks.  For me, it was just every Monday for 4 weeks, and the I switched to bi-weekly. I would say Hemlibra is **far** safer. I have taken Advate in the morning and it somehow faded enough that I end up with a bleed from playing darts/guitar at the bar by 3am. Was drinking of course, but nothing that physically stressful.\n\nWith Hemlibra, it just basically makes you a mild hemophiliac. It is completely consistent, too. I will end up with some joint pain after being physical, but I have never ended up with a bleed fading in from it.\n\nIt feels like it must be preventing any minor bleeding before it can become anything problematic. As far as I have experienced, factor just does not compare unless you have already got a bleed. That Is really intresting. Ty bro. Im thinking of switching after the first couple months of 2022 I am hem 8 a also and I made the switch abt a year and a half ago and it was a very easy transition, they make you take like 2 or 3 doses of factor to boost up your levels and then you just take your once a week hemlibra, I did not have to change my activity at all in fact I can do more things now than before Ty for telling me your experience. My doctor said i can take helimbra when im done with wresting because the normal factor is better for more intense things. Helimbra looks like a great experience lol. Can you travel more around the word with it sense you can last longer. How big are the things you need to set it up and inject. So for me I take it once a week and while\nFor some they take it every other week. So it is possible that you could have two months worth of medicines in just 4 doses which is amazing.

I will try that next Monday when I am there. I use 27\u2019s too. The pharmacy where I get my factor sends them with my supplies. Where do you live? Maybe I can hook you up with these guys? I am in Asia. I will try what the other guy said and ask the pharmacy if they can order a box for me. Ok good luck. I have ordered them online before but I cannot remember where. I just kept searching on google until I found a place that would send them. Make sure you get the right length too- 27g 3/4\u201d is usually what is best. What do you mean 3/4\"? They come in different needle lengths. 1 inch is too long, and 1/2\u201d is too short. So the 3/4inch is the one that most people use, but you need to specify when you order them.

I think either would work though.", "If factor products were as inexpensive as insulin would we maintain higher trough levels for joint protection?  Can you define trough level in this context? Trough level is the lowest level of factor before the next infusion. Most hematologist go for 1%, most likely due to factor costs, yet new studies say about 20% or 30% at the lowest might be what is really needed. Interesting question, however I do not know if I would use insulin as a comparison given all the stories of peoples struggles with access, treatment adherence and even dying due to the rising cost of insulin in the US. Good point... I use insulin becaue  it is expensive but nowhere near as expensive as factor and to compare it to something cheaper seemed to far fetched... I see what you did there. Yea for many reasons , if factor were cheaper and you had  better access therefor infused more often you would be much healthier. Do not take this the wrong way I am by no means trying to be a dick but I am curious where the information comes from. Cannot say I have discussed in depth the math and such behind my factor dosage with the hematologists but I feel like we definitely do not aim for 1% trough. And we have certainly never discussed adjusting my dosages based on cost. The only special consideration we gave for my dosage is to get to the next vial size so I would not have to mix multiples at each infusion. You can do a Google search for Hemophilia and protective trough levels and should get multiple research articles. I think the insulin analogy is a good one.\n\nIn the beginning the goal was to prevent hyperglycemia.  Over time, the goal is to keep a vary narrow range of blood sugars to avoid damage to the body.\n\nIt is clear that with Hemophilia gene therapy, that even if you only got to a steady 20% FVIII level you would be better off than infusing FVIII and spending some time at 100% and some time at 1%. I certainly agree that factor should be less expensive but I still do not know that cost is a prohibitive factor. I mean how many hemophiliacs actually pay for their factor? I mean between health insurance and the various factor assist programs that all the manufactures offer I think cost should not even be considered with prescribing a treatment for hemophilia. Especially for someone who is severe and would thus have less than 1% activity.  \n\nMaybe because I have gotten older and understand my body and the signals it is giving me I have always communicated with my doctor if I felt my factor levels were not rising enough. When I switched to eloctate and we were tweaking my dose to get me to 4 day intervals I could tell my trough was low especially as you tend to have more breakthrough bleeds when that happens. And we adjusted up. \n\nI am sure I am not the only one but for me it is almost like a 6th sense and I can tell when my factor is to low. That is where your extended half life factors come into play though.  I said it above in a more long winded manner but I cannot see price being an issue when I do not know of anybody who foots the bill for their factor. \n\nIf the majority of hematologist aim for one percent then I think it is because of outdated thinking. Not factor cost. That is true.  You could take an extended half-life factor as frequently as a short half-life and see higher trough levels. I mean it is a fair question.\n\nI like to use Diabetes when explaining Hemophilia to other in the sense that when well controlled, there are few outward signs, however when uncontrolled there lots of comorbidities. Yup, especially if you engage in high risk activities... I wonder if it is more of an issue for moderates and milds...  \n\nI get what you are saying about a 6th sense, but it is newer for me since I have only been on prophy six months..... And I have lived with pain and bleeds for so long (now significantly reduced) that it is a learning curve... It is entirely possible, I am certainly not trying to pretend to be an expert but a mild or moderate sorta has a buffer as far a a trough goes compared to a severe. I have always been able to tell my doctor and we adjust accordingly he trusts that I know my body and it is  signals so we have never really sat down and tried to do the math to plan for a trough. So much as we did the math to get my factor levels to where I felt fine from day one to day 4 on my infusions.  \n\nI also wonder since you are one of the rare flowers, that Is a girl with hemophilia. If there is just a lack of understanding  in your case in particular of troughs. Obviously The focus is always on joint bleeding with hemophiliacs but  obviously the trough needs to be planned around certain womanly parts of the month that most of us may over look as being considered a breakthrough bleeding episode. \n\nAll the same since I do not know of any bleeders paying for factor out of pocket the antiquated thought that the goal for one percent should be tossed. Factor up till you feel good from the first to the last day. All good points... newer research is showing that one in every 5 carriers has levels below 30 (mine are lower and the factor I do have does not bond right to VWD so it is not stabilized in my system)..... \n\nWhat is interesting is that, before I was properly diagnosed, I was told on multiple occasions that carriers waste expensive factor.... it was crazy... and many women and milds in general hear this... which is what caused me to pose the question... if cost were not an issue, would we raise trough levels, or even try to keep more people closer to 100 more of the time? Some argue that time at peak levels (closer to 100) are also important for healing, even if only there for a few hours every few days...... I only make scabs if I happen to cut myself on a day with prophy...  \n\nAs for us paying for it, true.... I am so thankful for good insurance..... it covers everything and, though my HTC did have to show medical necessity, it was easy to prove and then never questioned again..... \n\nI also found that the older HTCs who traditionally treated only severe men are more apt to mention cost over ones that have clinic days just for women, etc.....\n\nI hope that made sense......longer acting factor is something I am going to ask about at my next comprehensive visit.... but I think we are starting with a PK study, which makes sense......  I mean cost is definitely a huge issue for many.. it is why several companies have programs to help ppl. Some I have been on for example were like use their products for so long, get some free doses.\n\nOther issues include like when my medical bills reached a certain point, the insurance company just stopped dealing with the company my father worked at. They tried raising fees once, but then just noped out. The other employees were so pissed, bc they knew it was us and jumped my dad in the parking lot after work.\n\nMy HTC has social workers, insurance specialists, and even holds seminars on trying to deal with insurance companies. Yeah you should definitely find out how your body reacts and how quick your factor level drops. I am currently on eleoctate which is amazing. After a few dosage tweaks I get 4 days between infusions. \n\nI tell you what though if you want to talk about expensive it is probably at least twice as expensive as advate. Last time I looked they billed my insurance almost 60k for 8 doses. Works out to like 7k a dose. It is insane but I have not had a breakthrough bleed in a long time now because of it. I was on a study so my trough level was around 7-8% from half life calculations. However it was that pegylated stuff so take that into consideration. By the end of it, I was like Superman. Then they took a lot of blood from me over the next year after it ended and most of it is gone. I have only ever been at 100% continuous dosage when I was on the verge of dying. When I was on the trial, falls etc did nothing to me and that was with a peak of 70%. Would you want to go back on it? Totally! The half life was 20 hours, not 12. Even major surgeries had reduced bleeding significantly and back then I was having a major surgery annually.\n\nThere were concerns raised on the long term effect of having that pegylated stuff in your system though. So there is that. Wow! Why did you go off? Was it the end of the study or the safety issue? End of study. Right now it just makes better economic sense to infuse higher doses of regular factor as opposed to regular doses of extended half life factor. Are talking copay/deductible cost to the patient or cost to the payers, because the economic sense answer to that could vary wildly. That is a very good point; I was thinking about cost to payer, as the cost to patient's very wildly and are largely devoid of any economic sense. The reason I mention it is that cost to payer is a factor that may well affect the ability of a patient to follow a certain regimen as insurance companies likely will not pay for highly expensive plans that deviate from the dosing recommendations. My point is that extended half life factors are not worth the additional cost if you still plan to infuse relatively often, at least for factor VIII patients. They cost 2-3 times more, so if you asked me if I wanted 1000 units of eloctate daily vs 2000 to 3000 of kogenate, I would take the kogenate every time as a better way to keep factor levels high. Additionally, higher doses of standard factors every day or every other day are probably easier to negotiate than normal doses of EHL factors every day or every other day, as it is more in line with recommended dosing. If cost was no factor, EHL factor infused often is clearly the superior treatment choice, but standard factor is still the more pragmatic choice. Obviously acknowledging the still extortionate pricing of insulin in places, I would say in theory...yes. However, I think you would struggle to get any doctor to admit this. Sadly, I to often see haemophilia doctors out there reinforcing the \"acceptable\" trough level, which just feels so outdated and is language that really does not help the advocacy efforts to get people with high as troughs as possible.   \n\n\nSince the introduction of EHL factors, I managed to push from 2x a week to 3x a week prophy. My trough went from around 4% to 12%. Before, I experienced several bleeds a year and my ankle always felt a bit off especially by the end of the week. Since being on 3x a week for nearly 3 years....huge change. It is anecdotal but I am certain my elevated trough has helped massively. It is also worth considering that I am getting 1 extra peak a week. That is another time point where I am afforded a near normal level of protection. \n\nI would be keen to hear what a doctor would say in response to this question... Thank you. I hear stories like your all the time and wonder constantly. My trough is about 6.6 with two times a week prophy and I wonder what injuries would be like if that were pushed up.... I am still getting about a bleed a month, but happy to have prophy a all as a woman.", "Can someone with hemophilia drive a race car I wanted to get into go cart racing and hopefully one day into some real race car stuff and wanted to know if hemophilia would stop me from doing so. I have hemophilia A severe btw Reminds me of ~20 years ago when Aventis Behring sponsored a NASCAR truck.\n\nAnyway, the answer is the same as any other physical activity: it is your body to do with as you please. Will keeping your factor levels up allow you to drive things fast in controlled environments? Probably. Will it make things complicated in the event of a major crash/accident, no matter how much safety gear is in place? Also, probably. You have to decide how much you care about those probabilities, potential long-term effects, risks etc. Yes.

Had to quit due to unrelated back injury.\n\nIf you are passionate about racing and are willing to pay the ultimate price to pursue a passion, do it.  Just be prepared and know the risks.

Personally, as a Hemo I would skip that, I have driven gokarts, I have ridden sport racing motorcycles, I put them in the same category as go karts in terms of crash risk in full racing environments. When, not if, in a gokart crash you get ejected as there are no belts, so there is no car around you anymore. Watch some gokart crash videos on YouTube.

Whilst these people did not necessarily receive normal levels, many have shown sustained 3-5% FIX expression. These early studies were to test the safety of viral vectors primarily. We are seeing more promising results in FIX therapy now due to the addition of the Padua FIX variant which appears to achieve much higher factor expression.

I am curious to see how the rate of suicide in Hemophiliacs (especially older ones with more 'complications')  compares to the non-hemophiliac average.  I read that Barry Haarde, a somewhat famous older Hemophiliac who rode his bike cross country to raise awareness ended up committing suicide not that long ago, even though he was presumably not actively dying and seemed content.  I was only surprised by his suicide until I really gave it serious thought, now I just think \"that figures\".

Hemophilia can make you feel like you have an unfulfilled life, but I really do not recommend it.  Even for non-hemophiliacs people get amputations from bad accidents. You can probably imagine how catastrophic that could be. Imagine being a hemophiliac with one hand or one foot. We should not risk our health so easily. That is just the reality of the situation. Limits in that any injury will be more expensive, take longer to heal, and probably be more life threatening than for a normal person, but otherwise no reason. We will all die at some point so live like you want. You can do whatever you want so long as you are willing to accept the potential short- and long-term risks and consequences it could have on your health - same as anyone else. Certain health and safety precautions can reduce some risks, but not all, and you have to decide whether those risks are worth it.\n\nLearning to understand that, and finding the maturity to accept it even if it means you do not get to do something you want to do, is a part of growing up.\n\nThat said, if you want to be a dumbass, that is your prerogative, but it will not stop us from calling you a dumbass if your follow-up is \"I ate shit on the highway and the docs say I will not be able to walk normally again.\" It all depends on if you want to be here for a good time, or a long time.\n\nIn all seriousness, you can do anything you want in this life. But some things carry heavier consequences than others. You are very young and you have your whole life ahead of you. Do not waste it on something like this. I have seen far too many videos of moto accidents and death scenes of folks who are normal bleeders.\n\nHow much confidence do you have in your medical system? Would they be able to treat you and your condition in an event of a serious crash? Are you willing to take your medication more often to prevent injury? Are you willing to wear a helmet, protective jacket, pants, boots, and gloves at all times?\n\nReally think about this. Is it worth the potential pain, loss of limb, trauma, and possible inability to provide for yourself? Do you have people in your life who would care for you if you cannot dress yourself? Bathe yourself?\n\nI know I sound like a worried mom, but just consider these questions please. I will add definitely get a medic alert bracelet, wallet card, and possibly chest tattoo with your information Yes due to the fear of haemophilia I do not ride motos because one day I fell from my bicycle and my knee got injured and It become the target joint \ud83d\ude14(sorry for my bad English) No. Dumbass huh. I am 46 severe A and have been riding since I was able to balance. I have never been in a serious accident because I am careful and skilled and ride responsibly. I also do a lot of other things even people without hemophilia do. Your own fear and perception will limit you far more than hemophilia can. Severe A. I am 46 and have been riding motorcycles since I was 5 or 6. I am in better shape than most people my age, Hemo or not. I have never been in a serious accident and I have learned to ride properly and I am very careful. I have owned a lot of bikes, right now I have a 2018 Ducati ss, and a Ktm 450 dirt bike. I ride as often as I can, and always have. Yes, you can do anything you want. Just be smart and pay attention. I have never let hemophilia limit me, or people tell me I cannot do things, within reason (mma fighter is out of the question). I suggest you do not either. K Holy fuck dude. Your a \ud83d\udc51. 46 and ride all that shi? Your an inspration. You will motivate me to be a better rider when i do get my bike. Im also 17 btw Also do u do helimbra Oh shit. Sorry I did not realize who I was talking to! K I am sorry that you let your life be dominated by your insecurities. Good luck with that~ Awesome. Do not listen to anyone who tries to limit you. Stay on top of your health and with work and focus you can do anything. Attitude is everything. Take riding seriously because no matter who you are, it is dangerous. Definitely no wheelies! Those guys are nuts! But I feel like because I know how bad I could get hurt riding, I have learned how to ride extra carefully. It can be done. I know plenty of Hemo\u2019s who ride. My uncle is 70 something and still rides a Harley, and he is a bush pilot in alaska too. He had severe A and was alive before there was even factor, and he still flies where most people do not. Anything is possible. I have been on Hemlibra for just over a year. It is great. I still have to infuse sometimes because I push myself pretty hard, but I infuse way less than ever. It is a new drug and there might be some kinks to work out, but it is been a big help to me. I was getting so tired of infusing every other day or more, and my veins were shot.  Just a nooby moto questions here but are super bikes such as ducati ss boring on the road sense u cant really go fast cause of the law or u find a way around it? Also im thinking of ninja 400 as first bike but idk if to get a zx6r which is a 600cc ss or a liter bike such as bmws1000rr. Or just get cbr650r and stick with that as my second and last bike Yea the bigger Ducati\u2019s do not like to go slow. But there are plenty of highways where I live so it is perfect. If I were you I would start smaller for sure, do a lot of reasons. You will have way more fun on like a ninja 400 or a Ktm 390. Those light bikes are plenty fast and way more fun to learn on. Do not get a big bike to learn on, there is nothing in it. I would even start on a smaller enduro if I were you. Ride that for a year then get a street bike. Plus with an enduro you can practice on back roads and trails which is a lot of fun. I would not really recommend anyone go straight to city/highway riding. If you do, take a safely coarse and ride a lot in neighborhoods and back roads before you get into heavy traffic. There is a lot to learn, but it can and should be done. I tell anyone tho, if I had not ridden from a young age I would not feel safe on a street bike, Hemo or not. That being said, I started riding street bikes at 16 with no fear or regard for safety advise, and I am still here. Just be really careful. Never ride tired or above your ability, or impaired obviously. What Is the most speed youve done on highway? Its just that my dream bike is bmws1000rr 2017+. Ofc that is like 4-5 years from now if my passion sticks with me but im planin to get ninja 400 then either zx6r or cbr650r and then couple years after those 600cc\u2019s i get that bmw. How does your family see your decision on riding that fast ducati or motos in genral? That sounds like a good bike plan! My family has never mentioned anything besides wear a helmet and be careful. My Mom is a year younger than my Uncle, who has severe A hemophilia and has been a pilot since he was 16 (you could fly younger back then). He used to wake her up at 5:am when he was 14 and she was 13 , and they would take one of their parents float planes out to a lake and go fishing until he had to be to work (at the flying service my grandparents owned) at 7. So we have a history in our family of not letting hemophilia limit us. So my mom never batted an eye. We also had a 12\u2019 quarter pipe in our back yard as a kid, for bmx and skateboarding. I finally stopped skating because I hurt my ankle too much. Some things will hurt you. But things like flying airplanes or riding motorcycles, or driving fast cars will either kill you, or not. I mean, how many Hemo\u2019s here have fast cars and drive crazy??, cmon! Just learn your skill and be careful. And, get good road gear, a nice helmet, pants, gloves, leather jacket- that stuff is a must even for short rides. I have fallen before and that padded gear saved me. I just slid, did not even get a bleed (and I bleed super easy), I was just a bit sore. I did not ride with road gear for the longest time tho. Probably until I was in my 30\u2019s. But I probably should have. Even if you do not crash, getting hit in the knee with a rock at hwy speed sucks! That was a long answer. I do not mind the questions. I am a huge advocate for hemophiliacs doing what they can. Especially (obviously) if you have access to factor and medical care. For those of us in places with not as good of care, I am not sure how I would answer this stuff. But if you can get factor, use it! Oh yea, fastest speed I have been to is around 130. Anything faster is just too scary. Even that speed I could not stand for more than a couple seconds. I have been on rides where I was at 90 for almost an hour straight tho. Pretty fun. I would not try that for a few years tho, on trusted and empty highways. (I live in AK, so there are plenty of roads like that). Nice bro. You got a really inspiring family. My parents struggled alot before we got to yhe US. When my brother was 12 and i was 4 my brother got a GNARLY shin and knee injury from someone accidently kicking him. We use to live in the dominican republic and decided afger that that we needed to go to the US for the medicine and better life. We did but especially my mom(my dad said i could but when i mature a bit more and behave which he said im doin better in) my mom is really against it cause shes beyond over protective. Be grateful u got a supporting family bro cause shi for mes looking grim. Also how much was that ducati ss? U ever go fast on it? And one more question, im 6,2 what gear u recomend? Ty Yea I am super thankful for my family. The Ducati was a lot new, like 18,000. As far as gear goes, go to some motorcycle places and look at what they have. They will know more than me. Dude just do whatever you want. I have had people telling me what I should do for most of my life. Let us be honest....you slam into something at 100+ mph it is not really going to matter if you are a hemophiliac or not. Try all the things you want. Sky dive, lift weights, play contact sports, climb mountains. Do what makes you happy. Being a hemophiliac is mentally and physically taxing enough. Do not let other people tell you how to live.

(Mexican, English is not my main language sorry if I write strange or something)\n\nI have never been totally aware of my disease until a couple years ago, I just let it all to my parents, try to not hurt myself as a kid and that is all.  The entire life I believed I was mild/moderate with about 5%, but have a bleed about every week.. i thought it was normal, but every person I meet even with 1% or less says that he has one about every 2-3 weeks even a month. My doctor said to me that I am severe, because I behave as one.\n\nBUT, this is the riddle..\n\nI have NEVER peed blood, I can hit myself so bad = No bleeding or bruise. Straight punch to the wall, no bruise. Play soccer or have high phisical activity, no bleeding.  But does not care what I do, how much care i take, I need factor every 5-7 days, for an ankle, my right elbow or a random muscle... If I barely walk in the week = bleed, cannot get through the 7 days. If i play soccer = no bleed that day, but still cannot get through a week! and this happens with everything, i get a random bleed everywhere every 6-7 days does not matter what i do, but i can do \u201cwhat i want\u201d and be okay. \nNo need of crutches, a night of rest and I will be fine in a day with one dosis of factor.

Have ear piercings now and had no problem) but I need factor every between 3-7 days, for a bleeding that I do not see. If I hit my muscle i get no bruise, but it hurt as it gets hard to move and to the touch. \n\nI started getting aware about this a couple years ago, and this bother me so much.

It is just one more thing from life that I need to be mindful of. I would recommend that you worry more about finding a treatment plan that lowers the number of bleeds you have than comparing your situation to others based on your FVIII level.  There are thousands of FVIII gene mutations and researchers still do not fully understand all of the things that make one person's condition better or worse than someone else's.\n\nI do not know what FVIII product you are using or what is available to you, but you should ask your doctor about an extended half-life product like Eloctate or the new product Hemlibra (which you can read about on other threads in this subreddit). I have a 1 year old child with mild A, and your comment made some good to me. Thanks. When I was younger I was more stressed and paranoid about it (I blame it on the puberty), but after I got through that phase, it is just one more thing for me to not forget.\n\nGet my keys, wallets, check the weather etc.... and take the shot.\n\nI guess Hemophilia prevented me from becoming a professional athlete, but I never really cared to be one anyway. I still played basketball, soccer, and most other sports while growing up. Extreme heavy contact sports like American Football, hockey probably should be avoided, but I never really cared for those anyway. Oh...to be 18 again, but knowing what I know now! Take it from a fellow severe - DO NOT neglect preventive treatments, especially if you are playing soccer or otherwise active! I had a bit more joint bleeds than you (and/or at a younger age). I have also had lots of \"random\" muscle and other soft tissue bleeds, sometimes days after a \"bump\" or for no apparent reason. My R ankle, L knee, and R shoulder were all totally shot by age 22. I had four surgeries on them in my 20s, including a total knee replacement at age 25 and a R shoulder replacement at age 27. The knee has been GREAT, the shoulder marginal. But the ankle was only somewhat better for a few years, then gradually got worse than it was before. Since ankle replacements are hit-or-miss and I resisted getting it fused, I just suffered through the pain (as the left one gradually caught up to it) for 20+ years. Although I used to be pretty active (basketball, hike, rock climb, skydive, etc), the severe ankle arthritis has severely limited what I can do for about 15 years. The worst part of that is missed opportunities to be active with my kids. I finally had my R ankle fused in Sept. My cast FINALLY comes off next month and I will still have to take it easy for 2-3 more months. It is a very difficult and inconvenient healing process. But given a do-over, I would have had both ankles fused much sooner!\n\nMy point is that the damage from repeat bleeds will sneak up on you. The moderately annoying discomfort you may already feel on occasion can become severe disabling pain fairly quickly once the damage reaches a tipping point. I hope you can do better to PREVENT bleeds so that does not happen to you. But if it does, be as aggressive as you can about getting the pain relieved, even if that means joint replacement or fusion. Both are a difficult recovery. But trust me, living with severe chronic pain for decades is MUCH worse, even if you develop a ridiculously high pain tolerance like I have.

I have never had much of a problem getting shots in the past, since the wound is so little, but historically some have bled more than others, so I generally look up whatever vaccine I am getting in advance to see what others in the bleeding disorder community have to say about it so I know what to expect. The COVID vaccine was no different, and the NHF and HFA posted on their websites reassuring that it would not be a big thing. Based on what they said, I determined I would probably need to apply pressure for a little longer than the flu shot or something, but figured it would not be any issue because of the fifteen minutes you have to wait afterwards before leaving the clinic anyway. \n\nI was super excited to get my vaccine, and woke up at 4 AM to schedule an appointment because they were difficult to get ahold of in my area at the time. I sat down to get it and the technician\u2019s eyes immediately moved to my medical ID bracelet on my wrist and asked what it was for. I explained and assured her it was fine, but she said she did not want to give it to me. I was genuinely confused and continued trying to politely convince her. Eventually, I had to pull up the HFA website to show her. And she reluctantly agreed to vaccinate me. It did not bleed much at all (comparatively lol), I was perfectly fine.\n\nI mean absolutely no disrespect to her or any medical professionals, she is doing an incredibly important service in ending this thing. I just thought it was weird that she so vehemently disagreed with my description of my own medical condition.\n\nAnyone else ever have a similar experience?

No bleeding either - I infused for the first just in case, but not for the second. \n(S\u00e9v\u00e8re VWD) I had prophylaxis before the vaccine and the nurse there just noted that I had haemophilia and that I had infused before the jab. Had a similar experience and had to get an official okay letter from a haemophilia specialist, they denied to vaccinate me till I had that letter and it took me a long time to get it. I am a nurse and have hemophilia, that particular person's choices were pretty strange and if they had concerns they probably should have asked someone else! I had no issues with either jab related to hemophilia personally.  &gt;I explained and assured her it was fine, but she said she did not want to give it to me.\n\nIn fairness to the tech, \"do not worry it is totally fine\" is not something you want to hear from a patient under the best of circumstances, especially if it is regarding a condition you are not familiar with!\n\nI made a joke about how the needle was smaller than I was used to and my nurse freaked out for a second, then after I explained she insisted she would press the gauze down on the injection site for two minutes rather than the usual 30 seconds \ud83e\udd37 I have had one or two people hesitate to give me shots before.  They have all been vaccinations and probably people that do not have an extensive medical background.  Once I explained that I punch a vein 3-4 times a week they conceded.  The most aggravating bout of ignorance I dealt with was having an emergency appendectomy.  Laying in the hospital bed a day or two later I asked for a shaving kit and the entire nursing/orderly staff had a mental fit trying to decide if it was safe.  Nobody wanted to be responsible for handing me a razor.  Finally my hematologist came by to look in on me and she told them to bring me a razor.  I get being cautious but adult patients know what they can or cannot handle.  You should absolutely have caution if you have blood clotting disorders, but not so sure about this.. you are probably better off than any. Lol I had to wait to get cleared by the Doctor they had on site to get my vaccine, the nurse doing my registration did not know what vwd was so she did not want to clear me without confirmation it was safe. Doctor told her it is safe, and told me to press on the injection site for 2 minutes and off I went to get my injection. From my experience the person who gave me my vaccine didnt know what hemophilia was entirely I had to explain to them three times that it was a bleeding disorder and they were like so its a type of cancer right?  Or they would say some ridiculous things and called a doctor over who almost did not let me get the shot until I told them my hemotologist said it was ok and even then they were hesitant. When I was in high school, I was never able to convince the school secretary that I did not have cancer. I told her over and over again and tried to explain it, but it never got through to her lol.\n\nEventually I kind of gave up because she tended to be strict with the other students and not especially friendly, but was kinder to me because she thought I had cancer. One time senior year she let me leave early because one of my teachers was being terrible to me and I did not want to be there anymore (totally different wild story)\u2026 she was just like \u201cI will handle it honey it will be an excused absence do not worry about it\u201d which was really nice but I felt kind of guilty because she definitely was helping me out because she thought I had cancer. I would have used stimate if it had not been recalled last year (i have pretty bad type 1, so I used to use my stimate/DDAVP pretty frequently but only do infusions for more serious bleeds). End of the day, I probably would not have needed the stimate anyway:) Yeah - I have no idea when they will fix that (does not work on me but still\u2026) \nAnd yeah, I was cautious with the first one, then decided I was being overly cautious! Yea stuff like this happens all the time. Sometimes medical people do not know what they are talking about, but like to think they know best. When this kind of thing happens just stand up for yourself and tell them you know what you need and they usually give in. I have had to learn to be my own advocate. I do not let anyone tell me what is best for me but me. Usually if you are confident with what you want people respect that. And when they do not I have sometimes had to put up a fight. Being my own strong advocate has probably saved my life more than once. Do not feel guilty you tried telling her lol but my school nurse knew about hemophilia and still checked up on me asked me if I needed a break for a bit stuff like that. Even when I got into a \"fight\" with a kid, it was not anything serious or special I coldcocked the kid and he was taken back from what happened, the kid was bleeding from his face and his face I am general was swollen on the left side she was adamant to tending to me first even though I just had red knuckles. I tried telling her I was fine and she needed to attend to the other kid cause he was bleeding but she just would not have it, it was nice to have like special treatment but at the same time it is like it is not really needed but thank you. So many ppl have no clue about hemophilia and how it works, so I do not blame them for the most part anymore. So many think a papercut is going to kill me. A lot of family doctors will not see me bc they are terrified of my hemophilia and screwing up. \n\nLuckily, I finally found one 2 towns over\n\nGlad you got it though, mine did not really bleed either, and I took an ice pack with me, and kept it on for 10 mins after the shot. A lot of those techs are not familiar with our disorders at all, and have to be hesitant if they do not know about it. Instead of trying to refuse you, she should have asked around. But if it is a small place like some pharmacy, they might not have anyone around who is familiar with it, and try not to take any risks due to lawsuits.\n\nHeck, even dealing with doctors we tend to know a lot more than them about our condition.\n\nI think bleeding disorders as an umbrella term were just flagged for the after-care of possible bruising and applying pressure, or using coban instead of a band-aid.\n\nThankfully, my shots were done by nurses, and my 2nd shot even from a nurse who had some experience with the contaminated blood products in the 80s. There was a weird and vague warning on the pamphlet we were given pre-vaccine. My vaccine was administered by the military. I asked about the warning and what it meant and they huddled and came back and said \"well, you might bruise\". I was like lol, i bruise from going through a turnstile, that is fine. I did not even bruise.\n\nThey might have seen that warning and assumed the worst from it.\n\nMild type 1 vwd here.", "A local hemophiliac burned too brightly yesterday.

Hi everyone I am a 24 year old M and I just started taking hemlibra (1 month ago) after being on factor for the entirety of my life, so I was wondering if anyone has any experience with hemlibra and recovering from workouts. I just started going to the gym recently and I have noticed an increased soreness compared to when I was on factor and going to the gym. Does anyone have any thoughts/recommendations I would say you are probably imagining it unless you are pushing yourself more without realizing it. Funny, but I was actually just doing some arm reps right after I opened Reddit and was reading this.\n\nAfter I first got on it(I am 33,) I noticed playing darts at the bar would still sometimes result in elbow pain that felt similar to the start of a bleed, but there would just never be any bleed. In that case, I think it *was* just because I was not worrying as much about holding back and my joint damage started getting to me. Hemlibra only raises you to the equivalent of around 30% factor. People with 30% factor still bleed after workouts and doing things that would aggravate joints. If I am doing hard things like dirtbike riding or hard exercise then I do an infusion before just like I regularly would. I have noticed now though that the better I get in shape the less infusions I have to do because I am getting stronger. Hemlibra is great for keeping little things at bay. And factor works better now when I do have a bleed. I still use as much the first shot but I do not have to do as many follow up shots as I used to. I hope this helps. You have to adjust to a new normal on Hemlibra  but once you figure it out I think things well go pretty good. Just do not let the doctors try to convince you that all you need is hemlibra because if they say that they do not know what they are talking about. \u201cOnly\u201d, lol.  I would take that, what does a typical prophy dose give you, 40% for twelve hours? I need to switch. Typically 80% to 100%. 6% to 30% is considered mild hemophilia. People with Mild hemophilia still bleed. If you have under 50% factor 8 you have hemophilia. Hemlibra puts you at a steady constant low factor level. Compared to the higher peaks and lower troughs of replacement therapies that you can plan around.\n\nIf you are having consistent trouble recovering, maybe talk to your team. You can always treat it like a bleed and infuse with extra replacement therapies on top of Hemlibra, but this sounds like it would be an ongoing thing.", "Mild Hemophilia A I was born with Mild Hemophilia A, so it does not really affect me that much because of the severity.

Because it changes things so much. But that is another long  discussion for another post. I have not experienced this. Since hemlibra I have not even had a bleed that needed any correction.

Im afraid that this medication will cause problems down the road.. idk im almost 30 and well down here in tx friends my age and older are very iffy about even tryin it out It is a pretty well understood medicine as far as the mechanism in which it works. I did a lot of research and talked to some of the most educated hemophilia people around, and there is not much to be concerned about, as far as I can tell. I think the soreness I am experiencing may actually be from a different medication I am taking. I will know for sure in a week or two when I quit taking it. But honestly, I am one of those people who is very careful about what medicine I take, and I have years of experience working in the hemophilia world, as well as 44 years of having severe A, and I have vetted this medicine as well as is possible. So, take advice from this internet stranger... I think it is safer than any factor ever has been. And it works really well. The only danger I see is that people might not treat for serious bleeds when they should, because they think Hemlibra is covering them. It works, but only as a preventative measure, not for trauma. Some people think it is redundant having to carry two different types of medication factor and helimbra.. what if you are in an accident or experiencing a major bleed..  i am guessing you have to go into the ER and they have to calculate how much factor they can/have to give you because of the helimbra in your system? No. You can take the normal amount of factor on top of Hemlibra. It does not double up. That only can happen if you have inhibitors and you are using something other than factor VIII. As far as having two kinds of factor, that is not a worthy argument, since Hemlibra is taken every 2 weeks. So you will be carrying far less factor- your small Hemlibra dose, and an Emergency dose. It is still less to carry. I think medicines like Hemlibra are going to greatly change the lives of hemophiliacs for the better. I can tell you from my experience, I am a new person. And if I have a bad bleed, I treat it the same as I would before. There is no more risk of overclotting than when using factor alone. But these are all questions you should ask your HTC. They should know this stuff. Good luck. Do not be afraid to find out the facts. It is all known. Not a mystery, or magic or whatever.  Severe Hemophilia A with an Inhibitor here. I noticed something similar to this after this last year. While I have not had a single bleed since I started, I now have the skeleton of an elderly bricklayer. (I actually only got my first bruise last week after goofing the Hemlibra injection.) I had a theory about why I might be having more problems with arthritis now that I am not bleeding. I think it probably has something to do with microbleeds. Our joints are already really damaged, and I imagine the tiny bleeds that might happen MIGHT contribute some lubrication? I will see what my own Hematologist has to say on the matter. I know about microbleeds a bit from when I was using a factor that did not work as well for me. This is not the same at all. It is not in just my joints, and it feels like the flu pain, without being sick. Usually in the morning. But I should make sure it is not something besides hemlibra. It could be a reaction to gaba. I am weaning off of it now so I should know more in a week or 2. There are things I think about different bleed types that I think we will see on hemlibra though, in the same arena as microbleeds. I think with a constant low level of factor, like what hemlibra mimics, we might get small bleeds that resolve without treatment , but still cause damage. Partly because they do t get so bad that we do not treat and rest, but bad enough to be bad for the progression of arthritis. Because of the micro bleeds into joints or whatever tissue scars and makes someone sore. So yea. I have come to the same place as you sounds like, as far as my observations predictions assumptions or most likely scenarios about hemlibra. I hope they keep working on it and make it work better. It would be great if it raised the factor level more (in the way that it does). Still it beats hitting veins and being laid up so often. I am doing a lot better than I was using only factor. I still treat tho. I learned that right away from some injuries. My hands. Those have been getting sore. Not sure if its the meds, or just the more manual labor I have been doing since warm weather is finally here. I ride motorcycles almost every day, and after awhile my hands get tired of holding the grips.  All my other joints are fine though. Yea me too. Sore hands, almost like they are puffy in the morning, and stiff. I have been riding motorcycles every day too. Doing a lot more than I could before, more consistently anyway, so it is hard to say exactly what the soreness is from. But I had long runs of having no bleeds in the past, and was just as active as now and did not have this weird stiffness then.  Im going to keep an eye on this. It might be important to point out to doctors. I have a feeling this will be one of the side effects of Hemlibra that will need to be addressed. If it is the case, I would at least like to figure out something that helps it. It sucks being sore and stiff in the morning. Not as bad as bleeding all the time. But I was never sore like this before. \nI did have it explained to me that the mechanism how Hemlibra works is similar to a vaccine. So the soreness (arthralgia) could be similar to the flu- our bodies are reacting to the Hemlibra as they would a virus, swelling for whatever reason as an immune response.", "BioMarin Pharma (BMRN) Says Late Breaking Abstract for BMN 270 Accepted for Presentation at WFH ", "Knee surgery for severe hemophilia Hey guys.

Over the years my boys have had EVERY bleed possible. \nAsk me anything about any bleed,recovery, treatment ... ect. \nAlso just ask anything about raising 2 boys with severe haemophilia.\nIt is not easy, we struggle at times.\n Hi I am the youngest of five children. My brother and I were both born with severe hemophilia A. We were the first in our ancestry to be born with the disorder. I am sure it must have been really difficult for my parents raising us. \n\nI am now 22, moved out and living on my own. I take care of my own health and do not rely on my parents any more. \n\nMy question is this: What is your hope for your boys? \nSince you and my mother have a lot in common, I want to know a little of your mindset as to how you want your relationship to be with them in the future. I am wondering if there is anything I could do to show my mom appreciation for all the work she is done raising me. I want them to be happy.  &amp; tell your mum how much she helped you. I wish my boys would. \nI need to know that I have done a good job. If I have done one. \nI need to hear from them that it is okay to have haemophilia. \nI have terrible guilt about being a carrier. I feel my boys pain , but in a different way. \nAll I have ever wanted was for my boys to fit in. But I have realised over the years, they cannot just fit in. \n Sorry I did not answer .

I will definitely make the trip down to my hometown more often and give her lots of hugs and tell her how much I appreciate and love her.\n\nI want you to know that taking care of hemophiliacs is no joke, and if your kids are still alive and kicking, you have done a good job. I was not okay with having hemophilia until around highschool, then I started taking proactive steps in my own health care. I would tell my girlfriends I had it, and I would not make it more of a deal than it was. I become captain of the tennis team, president of two clubs, and well, just fit in fine. \n\nI am not sure how old your boys are, but I would recommend not losing hope that they will not fit in. I now view hemophilia as a large factor spurring my interest in the benefits of medical science. Experiencing life as a hemophiliac pushed me to major in Chemistry, and now pushes me further to pursue a PhD. It was a hardship I had to face head on, but the experience has turned me into a more responsible and tenacious man.\n\nI encourage you to give your boys as much responsibility as they can handle, so that they can learn to become self sufficient and one day, not rely on you anymore. If your goal is to make them happy, they must get a handle on their health themselves, and as soon as possible. \n\nGood luck with everything, and if you ever want to chat or have questions, I am just a PM away. You may find my perspective useful.  My boys are in their early 20s \n&amp; thanks  (Severe A in mid 20s here) Do not feel guilty. If you are anything like my mum you did everything you could for them and yet still blame yourself every day for not doing more. I love her to pieces and just want her to be proud, I could not ask for any more from her.\n\nThe future is bright! In the next ten to fifteen years gene therapy will be a thing (it is already in early clinical trials and the results are incredible!) There is nothing your boys cannot do. I live away from home in a foreign country studying a masters' degree (and have done for a few years now). I have friends, girlfriends, employers who have all known about my condition and it does not matter to any of them one bit. I have never been mocked or excluded for having what I have, ever (except when I could not do rugby in year 7/8 PE class).\n\nEncourage them to self-infuse and live their own lives. This does not control me and it does not have to control them! I really question the advancements to haemophilia care. \nWhat has really changed in the last 20 years for the average person with haemophilia ??? \nNothing ...  prophlatic treatment still the same. \nMaybe the product is easier to make up. \nUnless your on a trail . Your Hemophilia is treated the same as it was 20 years ago    As a person in his mid 30s with hemophilia the changes have been incredible during my life time. \n\nThe reason things have not changed in the last 20 years was due to the incredible advancement in the previous 15 years.  We now no longer worry about diseases like HIV and Hep and we can do prophylactic on a level that we could not for the first ten years of my life.  \n", "I am curious if anyone has had any luck with elbow braces on a target joint? So I have had a bad elbow over the past 2 years. It got to the point where I had to switch to prophy, then eventually upgrade from Recombinant to Eloctate and now I am on Hemlibra which is working wonderfully along with physical therapy, however I still get bad aching in my left elbow when doing certain physical activities (one, for example, is using my racing wheel on Xbox).\n\nI really want to get back into using my wheel again, but within 15 minutes of using it my elbow begins to ache, and in the past it would cause bleeds. I was wondering if anyone has used an elbow brace for a target joint and how it works for you? What one would you recommend (should I talk to my doctor about it or can I just get along with buying a cheaper one on Amazon)?\n\nThanks! Have you got a PT that you work with? They can help you gradually strengthen your elbow so you do not keep re-injuring by inadvertently trying to do the things that you used to do all the time before the series of recurring injuries...make sense?\n\ntl;dr get a good, bleeding-disorder experienced PT. They will help you do wonderful things I worked with one last year for 6 weeks. It helped a lot and I continue to do my workouts every day on my own, but in most cases I am perfectly fine. But for whatever reason there is something about my racing wheel that causes aching (I think it has something to do with rotating my arm repeatedly in that motion). I am fine in my real car, but I am not racing it around a track in real life so it is not really the same. \n\nIt is far better since I started PT last June, though. I have not had a bleed in my elbow since sometime mid-last year but idk. There was talk about it possibly being arthritis but we have never done an MRI or anything to check for sure. It acted up once after banging it on a door and it started restricting motion temporarily back in January (I was 2 months into my Hemlibra at that point) and my Hematologist did not think it was a bleed but we treated with the Eloctate just to be sure. It went away after a day and I have not had that pop up since again. But I do not know. Maybe I will see if I can get a better PT but there is not many options in my area and would be a potentially long drive and insurance is a bit weird about it. If those were the cards I had then me &amp; my elastic bandages would get even closer than we already are! Good luck (-: A brace might work, more PT might work over time, changing your grip on the wheel or seating posture might work - or a combination of all of the above.\n\nA $15 elastic brace on Amazon should not be that much of a hardship - buy it and see if it works. It is at least a starting-off point. I have used braces for ankles and knees over the years and they have been helpful.  However, I have also noticed that the more I used them, the weaker that joint became, because it was becoming dependant on the brace.  Use it if it helps, and especially if you can avoid bleeds, but be conscious of the fact you can become dependant and adjust accordingly.  Using it a few hours a night is probably different than walking on a brace days at a time, but that is my experience so take it for what it is worth.  I have tried a few elbow braces and all I have gotten from them is reduced circulation in my hands. Ankle braces work great, elbow not so much. Ask your doc about voltaren. It is a pain relief cream (maybe anti-inflammatory, i forget). Does not last super long but it is targeted to where you apply it and has worked great for me. Good luck! Exactly this. At one point in time, we were recommended to wear these braces. End result I was limping all around for years and my elbows became very bad. After going off them and starting prophylaxis, they have improved greatly.\n\nMy own experience. Yours may vary.", "Gene therapy  Think the source is reliable?

I have just attended a national conference specifically for those suffering from inhibitors. I myself was the first in my country to receive emicizumab (heamlibra) I only just joined this subreddit and was wondering what are the percentages of nationalities on here? I have scrolled through and there is obviously others on emi. I was wondering 2 things:\n\nFor those of you living outside the US what is your access to Haemlibra like? Have you had any difficulties applying for it, or accessing Information.\n\nAnd for those inside the US what is your process for applying for/getting access to Haemlibra? Obviously our health are systems are very different.\n\nObviously if these are too prying questions I totally understand and am sorry. Just curious for who makes up this subreddit and what their journeys have been like. I live in Ireland and I am with the Irish haemophilia society. In Ireland, they have the ability to go into hemlibra without any extra costs. Many of my friends are in it with inhibitors I also went to an inhibitor summit that took place in Ireland just a little while ago! Hello blood brother! Do you know what the application process is like? For us it is not got funding for everyone, we have to do a named patient application. As in prove we are in bad enough shape to require funding. Similar in Ireland? Or is it just available for whoever wants it? Blood sister more like haha! To the best of my beliefs it is anyone that requires it can get it, if your doctor recommends that it would be good for you it is almost certain that you can get it. Luckily it is not means tested! This is what I have heard anyways and I attend a lot of conferences to do with haemophilia and Von Willebrands care in Ireland! My apologies haha. Thank you for answering. And that is the way it should be, those who need it should be able to get access. Especially inhibitors patients. No problem! I think the exact same way! It should not be means tested it should to available to those who needs it! Ireland is a really good place to have Haemophilia and any bleeding disorders. There is a lot of funding available and we just had our first gene therapy person last week! Hey! US person here, Haemlibra has already cleared our FDA and is available for use, most of the time it is just need to talk to HTC doctor and they will see if you want to get on it. After that it is just the good ole fight with the American Healthcare system. \n\nTLDR: Ask doc, punch insurance in face, Repeat step 2 till they give up, new meds. So the government is still funding it for you? Or is it insurance. Also its not an issue of FDA in nz its funding :/ The US health system surprisingly works well for many hemophiliacs. With the drugs being so expensive, manufacturers pay for our out of pocket costs, so I get my medicine for free. And as a bonus, any surgeries or doctor visits I need for the rest of the year are covered since I hit my out of pocket maximum.\n\nIf you do not have health insurance, there are other avenues of aid that manufacturers offer.\n\n(Hemlibra is actually like $5 a month, but practically free) Outside USA. Do not have Helimbra here. Do not have extended release Factor VIII here either. The most high tech drug available is recombinant. I am in the UK (with the NHS) and was offered it, I declined (for now) but know that I can call up my centre and start on it if I want to.\n\nPersonally, I did not like the idea of still needing a supply of my NovoEight factor in case I was badly hurt, coupled with the short life of Hemlibra outside of the fridge compared to NovoEight (7 days vs. ~6 months).

To give you an example why, in high school, the other hemophiliac (moderate) at the school was constantly infusing. My mother made fun of him for being \"weak\" and gloated how I am mild and did not need infusions. Now here I am, responsible for my own health, and realize I need to infuse a hell of a more than I have. Just this year, I have infused about 6 times (4 surgery related).\n\nHere I am, sitting at a ski resort, with my wrist and tailbone throbbing from a fall while snowboarding. Of course, I left home without my Advate, and am paying for it dearly. It is only been a recent realization that I need to infuse a lot more, be more careful, and pay better attention to my body. To those with mild hemophilia A, what is your relationship like with your factor? I am thinking I should just start infusing prophylactically in situations like this, and actually remember to bring it \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \n\nI am having to change Hematologists due to changes in insurance, and cannot reach out night now. I am definitely not the best at managing my disorder.  Hey, I am not sure where to start. PM me any time with any questions. I have been through all of this stuff and can help with whatever.  I am also mild at 7% but usually have at least one bleed a year and have had some major ones in my life. It is tough when HTCs expect people like us to already have the resources and know how to manage everything at home. Feel free to PM me if you would like.\n\nI am a bit older than you and from an era where prophy was not standard, due to tainted product and a shortage (I think that was late 90s/early 00s). Now when I go back to camp as a counselor most of the kids there are on prophylaxis, even a couple mild ones. I am still not on prophylaxis and it is never really been a discussion with my hematologist to start - but again it could be due to age.\n\nWhen I was 20 I tore my iliopsoas and that was my first real bleed I had to deal with on my own at college. It was tough. Luckily I had professors who were sympathetic and an HTC nurse who was the best he could be for me. I was uninsured at the time because the ACA was not in effect and my dad's insurance no longer covered me. If you can get to an HTC, not just a hematologist but a clinic that focuses on bleeding disorders, they may have ways to help you are not aware of. They really do want to help. They will also have a social worker who can be a good resource.\n\nThe most important person helping you with hemophilia will probably be your nurse coordinator at your HTC, so be picky and honest with them. Life got a lot better for me when I could fully trust mine. I am a mild..same levels as you. I treated maybe 3-4 times over the first 20 years of my life (cut in the head, iliopsoas from basketball, and a bad cut woodworking). At 21 I had a severe ankle sprain I did not treat .. I let it be for 5-6 months and it turned to arthritis. I now have factor at home, know how to infuse, and travel with it at all times. I mainly infuse for my ankle if I know it is going to swell up from a long walk.\n\nI would definitely get in touch with your HTC and keep a stock of factor with u and know how to infuse..especially if you are traveling.\n\n Shoot up every other day. It is for your future self. I didnt and was a little too active for a hemophiliac now I got both ankles jacked up and my left elbow. If I would have just not seen myself as \"being weak\" for taking my medicine I would still be able to run and lift. I am 30, was diagnosed mild A at birth and have an uncle with mild A as well, so my family had a lot of experience in treatment. The only time I prophy for anything is with DDAVP nosespray and treat a lot of minor bleed/soft tissue bleeding with the DDAVP as a first line, if no improvement after a day I infuse my Advate 25 per kg dose and kindve go from there. I am also a nurse and feel like that gives me a little more insight to my bleeds, but usually my past experiences kind of guide how I treat. RICE first aid treatment is always a big part of treatment for me, and the most impactful prophy for my treatment has been 4-5 times a week of yoga/stretching/strength training. The scariest risk of not treating bleeds to me is the risk of compartment syndrome which can lead to loss of limb or fasciotomy, and no one wants to deal with either of those. I have been lucky enough to have great insurance benefits my entire life so paying for Advate has never been an issue so it is easy for me to air on the side of caution and treat if there is any question. The past few years of working on being active, regularly practicing yoga and lifting weights has made it so I rarely have anything but minor bleeds or bleeds from some kind of trauma; usually banging my knee on the bed frame, not thinking about it and treating a few days later for a small knee bleed. Hope that helps in some way.  Dude I know exactly what you mean. I always would look at the other kids and try to keep up and show that I was not \u201chandicapped\u201d fortunately for me it was caught fairly early on in life and after destroying a knee and having surgery on it when I was 5 we moved to prophy. I still probably over did it at times and did not treat as actively as I should or would try to hide bleeds. Couple that with being a growing kid and the factor available not being nearly as capable as it is now I still ended up with two bad ankles. \n\nFortunately that is my biggest issues and the knee surgery took care of everything that was wrong there. Just have some mild knee aches when the weather changes but no bleeds anymore. \n\n Keep in mind I am actually severe and cannot imagine what having mild hemophilia would be like compared to what I have gone through and endured for nearly 30 years. but with the modern day breakthroughs and safety of current production medications I would definitely consider prophy Eloctate. Stuff has an extended half life so you could definitely get away with every four days dosing. Or the possibility of hemlibra now which can have a half life of 4 weeks and is no longer injected into a vein which makes life even easier. One shot a month essentially. \n\nNaturally I am not a healthcare professional and you should talk to your hematologist about it. But it sounds amazing to me. I have a hematology appointment in 2 weeks to switch to hemlibra which I have heard essentially will make a severe hemophilia like myself mild. \n Hey, OP. Im a 22 (M) Mild Hemophilia on a 2 day prophy because I didnt manage my health well when I had my first major bleed at 17 (4 ankle bleeds in 3 months after the initial one). First and foremost, dont be upset about being on prophy. It sucks to infuse, but it will make such a difference in your life and you can definitely feel when you miss your days. I am still very active (frisbee, football, soccer, hiking, rock climbing, etc) and honestly without my infusions, I am not sure I could manage. If I were you, see if your doctor knows of a hemophilia community you could reach out to? I am from the midwest, so we have the Midwest Hemophiloa Association. It is a really great resource and I have made so many friends from going and helping them at their camps. I used to have this preconceived idea that people with our disease are more or less sedentary, fragile people, but after going to that camp with over 80 other people (of all ages) with bleeding disorders, I can assure you that there are folks like us, who love being active and manage to do so with timely infusions. Feel free to DM me if you ever need someone to talk to! Best!", "About teeth aligners for hemophiliacs I was wonder if aligners (not braces) can cause severe bleeds for Hemophiliac people? I was curious because I found this website  where they make custom aligners for your teeth. I am always worry about my 4 front teeth protruding whenever I smile and it bugs me off. I was wonder if this can cause any bleeds? If you are on profilaxis, it should not be an issue. You will have to get your dentist and hematologist to sync up and make a plan for you. I am on Hemlibra rn, once every 2 weeks. So I have to consult them first before going for it right? Thanks Yes. Definitely. You might need to up your dosage or frequency. I had conventional metal braces as a teenager and it was never a problem.  I have a hard time imagining these new plastic aligners causing a bleed. I know this comment is old but wanted to comment for future readers. I am hem A moderate (5%). Just wanted to say that I got Invisaligns and they did not cause any severe bleeding. Your teeth move really slowly when you get invisaligns so it dosent make you bleed at all. I did bleed a little from my gums once when I first had the trays. The plastic was pressing against a small portion of my gum and made me bleed a tiny bit. But if you floss and brush regularly you will be fine :) (I have sensitive gums) Always best to talk to your dentist and hematologist tho, they know best. Thanks for finding this post.

Lots of past posts in this subreddit on Hemlibra -- take a look through the search results for stories both successful and otherwise: (\n\nI am on Hemlibra and love it, and happy to answer any specific questions you have. Sorry been on Reddit a while and still do not know everything. Yeah I have been on it for about a year now was curious how it was affecting others I have been on it for a year and a half or so. I still get bleeds pretty often and have to treat with factor. But no where as near as often as I used to. And the bleeds tend to heal quicker and require less infusions to get under control. It is been tricky for me to learn that bleeds while on Hemlibra come on slower and are less noticeable, so I have let a few go too long and they became worse than they probably would have if they came on quicker so I had recognized them and infused sooner. If that makes sense. So I have had a few kind of bad , couple month long joint bleeds that I would not normally have. Because they did not feel like bleeds to me, until they finally broke thru and got bad, at which point they were already serious enough to have to spend a couple months baby-ing back to health. But now that I am used to how bleeds work on Hemlibra for me, it is better. I just infuse at the slightest sign of a bleed, and sure enough, it gets better. Then a few days later if I do not rest enough it can come back and I will have to infuse again and rest more, and I heal up. But they only usually take a couple infusions to fix. Where as before Hemlibra I would have to infuse every day for a week or two and rest in order to heal all the way. Now I can usually get away with only a couple I fusions and resting half as much as I used to have to. I think the advise they were giving with Hemlibra to \u201cwait and see\u201d if the Hemlibra stops a bleed is bad advise. It never works that way for me. If I have a bleed, it means the Hemlibra is t enough to stop it, and it is getting worse. More slowly, but still, if it did not stop by the time I feel it, it is not going to. That is my experience. Also though, the newer synthetic factors never worked at all for me either. I have to use alphanate or something with factor VIII and vonwilibrands for some reason. I guess some severe A hemophiliacs need to have both of those factors already bound together in the medicine, because our bodies do not recognize the synthetic factor VIII well enough by itself. Something like that. So maybe since Hemlibra is a way of tricking the body into making the clotting cascade, I still might need the vonwilibrands factor as well for me to make a clot sometimes. Hemlibra does keep a lot of the spontaneous bleeds I used to get from happening tho. So I am much better off now using it. But if I had to choose between Hemlibra and alphanate only, like if my insurance said I could only use one or the other, I would be forced to use tons of alphanate again. Because Hemlibra alone does not quite cut it for me. Luckily I have not gotten any push back from my insurance yet. Probably because I am using almost 1/10th of the alphanate I used to. So even tho Hemlibra is expensive it is still cheaper for them to cover both. Hopefully this does not change. It was also a little bit of a challenge getting the treatment center doctors to understand that I was still bleeding as much as I am on Hemlibra. But they eventually saw what was going on and kept writing on going scripts for both Hemlibra and alphanate.", "Cigna will no longer accept Co-Pay Assistance.

", "Iliopsoas bleed Tl;dr: Looking for recovery experiences with iliopsoas bleeds to feel less alone.\n\nI have Von Willebrand instead of Hemophilia but hopefully it is ok for me to post here since I think hemophiliacs are the only people who routinely deal with the personal hell that is psoas bleeding.\n\nIn January I had a spontaneous iliopsoas bleed on my R side. This was pre-VW-diagnosis and during a COVID surge in my area so I was hospitalized in the overcrowded hospital for 2 days because my hip was totally contracted and they could not figure out why, and the pain was so unbearable no amount of morphine was touching it. Finally they took a MRI and found the bleed, and immediately discharged me on bed rest with no treatment besides Tylenol for pain \"control\".\n\nThe hematoma from the bleed resolved after about 8 weeks (confirmed by MRI) and I have had physical therapy and follow up with a orthopedist but everything has been focused on exercising the injured muscle with basically zero improvement.\n\nI have really limited strength in my hip flexors on that side, 8 months later. We are talking, cannot lift my leg to climb stairs level of weak.\n\nAlso, I have been getting increasing pain that feels like a \"crunch\" inside my hip joint with any type of weight bearing.\n\nBetween the weakness and the pain, I still cannot walk reliably 8 months after the bleed, and I am in moderate-severe pain 24/7. Am I going to be in a wheelchair for life now?? I had this bleed on my right hip a week before flying to US. Had to suffer a lot of pain by only using ice pack since I cannot get any medicine. Once we got to US we went to a Hemophilia Treatment Center and got free medicines and this is where I met the PT. She helped me through a lot of exercises how to get back my strength on my right leg. I was same as you before very depressed that I thought I will not be able to walk anymore. We made the hip bleed heal first before doing any exercises. At first I still fall whenever I walk, right now I can run a little bit and walk for miles. The only problem is that you will still feel the numbness from your leg to your foot what I have mine until now. We are still figuring out on how we can also fix this. Do not lose hope. Everything takes time. I will pray for u. Oof. Yeah I have had quite a few iliopsoas bleeds. This is a complicated subject. If you want to PM me please do. Maybe we can talk about it. I know what you are going thru. It took me quite a while and the right way of understanding things to get better. But I have not had any more serious ones for a long time now. Anyway message me and we can talk Thank you! Messaged you! I have had multiple Psoas bleeds back in the early 2000's when i was in High School. I got my first one in about 1999 i think. I had been shoveling show (we live in west virginia), and the twisting motion of shoveling and throwing it is what pulled it. The bleed was so bad, i could not sleep at all, and the only pain relief i got was holding my thigh up to my chest with both arms. After going to the ER, they discovered via CT Scan that it was a psoas bleed, and I had a week long stay in the hospital with aggressive infusions to finally get over it. I had numbness in my knee cap area for years after that one!\n\nLater on, I had gotten another bleed in the Psoas while doing Marching Band. At our band camp i pulled it, and it bled for days and days, and i think required another hospital stay. \n\nThankfully, i started home infusing after those events. I will never play around with psoas bleeds again. I would recommend prophylaxis treatment to help prevent them if you are going to be doing something with twisting motions like Golf or something like that. If you do get a Psoas bleed, treat it aggressively! do 100% doses every 8-12 hours! You can \"potentially\" die from bleeding into that muscle since it is so large (that is what my hematologist told me). \n\nHave a good day! I think part of what has made this bleed so debilitating is that I never received any infusions or treatment for it, so there was a hematoma in there for several weeks compressing everything. I wonder if it is still bleeding a little, there was some blood still visible on the MRI but the orthopedist told me she considers it fully resolved.\n\nIt is crazy to me (but makes sense) that this would in some cases have been a hospital admission vs an immediate discharge, likely because of COVID overcrowding, which is what happened to me. I guess the ER doctors must have figured I was not going to die from the hematoma, but like you say and I have read, these bleeds can be life-threatening if untreated like mine was, so the whole thing is just upsetting.\n\nI would not even have been diagnosed with Von Willebrand if I had not insistently followed up with my primary care to determine a cause for the bleed. I \\*still\\* have not been able to get a treatment plan going forward for any infusions 8 months later. Hematology through my insurance has been extremely slow and they declined a referral to my local HTC (I have Kaiser in CA).\n\nI guess overall I should feel lucky that I am not dead or more disabled than I am but honestly the whole thing has been so painful so I mostly feel angry that I have not had more support. My partner of 3 years dumped me a week after I was discharged from the ER... he hated having to help me around the house, leaving me on my own to try to scramble and figure out how to keep myself alive when I could not move from the waist down without excruciating pain.\n\nIt is been a horrible 2021. Thanks for reading my rant essay. Oh my goodness, i am so sorry for all of that happening! what terrible experiences! : (   2021 has been a bad year, most definitely! \n\nWaiting for insurance companies to approve things takes so long, and it sucks that the patient is the one that has to suffer in agony!  And yes, you are very fortunate that you are still alive. now that hematoma might take a while to \"Work its way out\" of your body. The only thing i could recommend (which is probably exactly what you are doing) is to keep moving, so that the blood will organically work it is way out of your system. And hopefully, the insurance system will get with the program to be able to get you into some sort of treatment program and the care that you need. \n\nGod bless!", "Love you mom &lt;3 (does anybody relate to this?)

On the other hand it made school sports miserable as I was not allowed to join in with anything that resembled a contact sport. \n\nMany years later - I no longer have to worry about infected products and I can self infuse if needed.

Going To make this quick. I gota brother. Hes has scitZafrenia or however you say it. Bipolar also. We both have hem A but i think he has B, idk tho. Im 17 hes 25 and i was pretty safe when i was young living in the caribean with little to no factor my brother was very active when young and we moved to the US to gain more medicien cause my brother got a gnarly knee injury and from what i heard, his hole shin( the thing that is under the knee) was bruised and he needed medical attention. It was from playing soccer or somthing, idk. Okok ima drag on forever if i keep this pace up but long story short my brother has mental issues and has always DEEPLY HATED hemophilia. I know we all hate our condition but we learn to accept it but he hasent. He recently in the past years has a tendency to go ballistic and rage and trash shit, including his phone. 2 days ago he went insane while im out of the country and it was just him and mom. He raged about his gf not responding to him and his calls(IMOP he shoulder have a GF, he is jobless and unstable) and he trashed the factors that he had in the fridge and threw them away. Idk were tho cause mom never told me. So im nervous he is going to do something to himself or mom. She had to call the police and he got restrained and they asked my mom what is going on and in the end he got sent to the hospital and idk what is going on from there. Im worried and am looking for any advice or thoughts on the situation. For clearence on me, im fine and wrestle for my school team and am taking care of myself. Depending on the state, and what circumstances exactly brought him to the hospital, it is possible that he could be held up to 72 hours if there is a belief that he could harm himself or others. During that time he is entitled to basic healthcare, which I would guess does not include factor treatment, but I cannot say with certainty.\n\nIf it happened two days ago it is possible that he is still being held either in that hospital or a facility that has more psych resources. If that is the case, then there are more scenarios where he could stay longer than that, again depending on the state. \n\nIt is hard to say exactly what might have happened though. I work at a large hospital and it is not uncommon for our emergency department to have people under psychiatric evaluation end up staying for many hours while we attempt to find a state psychiatric hospital for them that has vacancy. It is also possible your brother was taken to the hospital and discharged relatively soon after. I am sorry for all the obvious pain your brother, and consequently, you family are going through.  Living with hemophilia by itself is tough, having mental issues like schizophrenia and bipolar only make things worse. \n\nPerhaps your hemophilia doctor can work with the psych doctors and get your brother some help in managing his emotions, or get him on medications to help him.  You should reach out to your hemophilia coordinator, assuming you have one, with the hospital you usually go to.\n\nIf they cannot help I can highly recommend Johns Hopkins Hospital here in Baltimore.  They have an excellent outreach program and it is my experience (62 year old with Christmas Disease) that that throughout my life they have help me with all sorts of issues tangentially related to hemophilia.  And if they cannot help you directly they may have resources in your area they can contact for you.\n\nAdditionally, it sounds like you and your family could use some standard counseling in dealing with your brothers actions of late. If your mother has insurance, check to see if that is available.\n\nI can PM you the phone number for the Hemophilia Coordinator at JHH that I know.  She is very good at what she does.  Let me know. Your brother sounds a lot like myself  when I was much younger.  I hated Hemophilia and everything about it. It was not just that it kept me from sports and activities that the other kids were able to enjoy, but just the fact that I was somehow different and \"defective\" and that really got to me.  By avoiding treatment  as much as I did, I managed to sustain a few permanent joint injuries that affect my walk and how much I can lift, and I was furious at Hemophilia for that as well.  I spent most of the best years of my life being angry and pushing everyone away, except for the few who were somehow willing to stick by me.  \n\nIt might seem like I am trying to sell you something, but what helped me was getting a nice set of over-ear headphones that blocked out all external sound and listening to a man named Alan Watts talk about who we really are and why we are really here.  I have seen countless psychologists and psychiatrists, and each time it ended up with me feeling sorry for myself and nothing ever getting better.  I was diagnosed with PTSD and all that did was make me feel that it was OK to act the way I did, because I had a legitimate medical excuse. I was prescribed mood stabilizing drugs but they were not very effective and  only seemed to add to my \"defective\" image of myself. Changing my perspective of myself and my place in life is the only that that made a difference.  You can find almost all of the lectures I am talking about, in audio format, and some video and text also, at ( and I sincerely hope you keep this in mind in case you find that nothing else works.  As I said, it saved me from harming myself and the people around me and it also made me feel a lot better about **everything**.  \n\nI am terribly sorry for your brother, and of course for your family and I hope your brother finds a way to be OK with the life he has, and thank you for posting this here.

Hey, having a bleeding disorder sucks. Hard. But I feel like those of us that grew up with one have a tendency, maybe out of necessity, to be pretty good at finding silver linings. Some of my most cherished childhood memories were from The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. That place is fucking magic. Danced with a girl for the first time there. Had my first real crush there. Made a whole bunch of special connections and a few lifelong friends. I really wish I would made more effort to be a counselor there and help make that magic in some other kids' lives. Too busy partying at that point in my life. And then there were the NEHA camps, which were almost as magical. So many friends there though. Hemophilia has brought me so much pain and suffering over the years, and on a daily basis at this point with all the arthritis I have. But I also would not have so many cherished memories and friends without it. Would not change a thing if I could. Well, might have infused more often, but I would not take it away. Camp High Hopes for me, the highlight of my year. Then my family moved to the midwest where I have stayed, with no local Hemophilia community. Hoping to drive 6 hours to Colorado to volunteer at their summer camps. No.  None at all. Camp bold eagle may be my favorite place on the planet, I love everyone there so much Camp Tapawingo Baby!!! I went to rocky mountain Easter seals camp for hemophilia and those are my best memories, dance at the end of the week, had my first kiss there. We went white water rafting in middle school and highschool, the nurses taught me about infusing and everything you need to know about hemophilia I went to a Catholic elementary school back in the early 80s.  Small, private school so everyone knew I was the \"fragile bleeder\" and I was treated as such.  I was not allowed to take PE or participate in any physical activities such as softball, kick-ball, field day events, etc... I was always the kid sitting on the sideline.  Meanwhile, I had a collection of exercises my physical therapist suggested I do to stay flexible and build up muscle to protect my joints and such.  And I had an evil, wicked stepmother that forced the exercises on me like some kind of punishment rather than being helpful or encouraging so I did them every single night.  Pushups, situps, pull-ups, stretches, etc...  Somehow eventually I signed up for Boy Scouts and of course half the scouts are my classmates.  One of the scout masters knows I am new and wants to help me get a few quick and easy badges so he starts with the physical fitness badge.  He asks me how many push ups and sit ups I think I can do to record it in my scout manual and give me a badge.  He is not actually making me do the exercises, he is just taking my word.  One of my school mates overhears me say \"probably 50 or 60 sit ups\" and he has a fit.  He knows I am the fragile boy from school that is not allowed to do anything so of course he assumes I am physically unable to do even a single sit up.  The scout master tries to calm things down, I tell the kid I can do more sit ups than him, and before you know it the whole troop is laying on the floor and we are having a sit up contest.  Most kids were done around 20-25 sit ups, a few make it a bit further but I am the last one still going by 50.  I stop since I have obviously \"won\" and the kid that challenged me to begin with reminds me I said I could do \"50 or 60\" so I lie back down, tell the kid holding my ankles I will finish without him, and I crank out another 50 before the place is going crazy and the scout master stops me.  Now I am a legend the next week at school.  Word spreads and eventually at the end of the week, during PE a few of the scouts tell the PE teacher how I dominated this sit up contest in scouts and how I am not fragile and I should be allowed to play.  I could tell the teacher felt bad having me sit out every class, game, event, etc... so it did not take much to convince him.  He just tells me that if any other teacher shows up (highly unlikely) I should slip off the field because he could get into trouble and of course I agree.  We split into teams and my team was up at bat first.  I was standing 20-25 feet behind home plate, lined up in our assigned batting order when the our first batter took a monster swing.  She missed the ball, she kept spinning around a full 360 degrees like a bugs bunny cartoon, let go of the bat, and it flew through the air smashing me right in the knee.  My PE participation was over before it started.  I only ever got as far as being picked for a team and assigned a spot in the batting order before being carted off the field on a stretcher and taken to the hospital via ambulance with lights and siren blaring.  It did not last long, but my bleeding disorder, wicked stepmother, and those miserable ass exercises I had to do conspired to make me a little legend for almost a week when I was in second grade.  Those were the days.  40 years later I am still waiting for my time to shine again.  I guess you could say I peaked early. I built a practice arm where I and my parents could practice infusing with. It was built out of tinfoil and straws and kept improving upon it such as adding food coloring and water in the straws.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Join the community!

Due to that when you  do factor test that is FVIII assay when on hemlibra it comes around 40-50-60% sometimes also as 90%, so i.e. why it is said that do not trust factor assay on hemlibra.

First off, talk to your doctor or HTC about it if you are curious. I and many who comment and give anecdotal experience are probably not medical professionals.\n\nMy understanding is my factor level is equivalent to about 12% at any given time because the half life of hemlibra is so long. \n\nIt is not factor, but an antibody that can fill Factor VIII spot in the clotting chain. Because it is not factor, and because the body favors real F8 over hemlibra, you can still infuse while on hemlibra and not have to worry about stroking out.\n\nI have been on it two years and it is been life changing.

If that makes sense. It was not a \"big deal\". Largely because it was hush hush for so long (I think due to HIV/AIDS stigma from when he was younger). \n\nAnyway. Just wanted to get it off my chest because none of my friends really understand because they do not have exposure to the disease, and have not lost their dad, so its a two-fer.\n\nIF I do have a child with hemophilia - will a doctor at a treatment center guide me? Or is it more of a figure out where to go and who to contact sort of thing? I just have a billion questions but I am assuming I would not know if they have it until they are born? \n\nUgh. I am already telling myself to calm down. If you live in a city with a treatment center, or if you can be in touch with one they should be able to help you figure all this out. If you reach out there are people who are more than happy to help and answer questions. You will be the opposite of alone. There is a pretty strong hemophilia community if you choose to become involved or try to meet people. If I were you I would try not to worry at all. If you had a boy, and if he had hemophilia, then you can worry. But even then, with treatments what they are today, things will be ok. I have hemophilia A severe and I am 45. I have been through the worst of what is possible and I am still healthy , more active than a lot of people my age and doing really well. I would not trade what I have learned from dealing with hemophilia for not having it. It is not something I see as a negative, it is just a thing that is somewhat different. Besides you will probably have a girl. Good luck starting a family. Do not let the possibility of hemophilia concern you. Cross that bridge if you come to it. First off- were you ever diagnosed with a case of hemophilia yourself, or any other siblings besides your sister? That alone can help inform the likelihood of passing the gene along.\n\nHemophilia is one of those things they can do the prenatal testing for because it is tied to a gene/DNA. For example, in my family we have my dad who is A- and my O+ mom. She almost bled out during the births of me and my little sister, but no one knew why and she was basically told not to have anymore kids after that. When my sister and I were 15/16, she was getting treatment for really heavy menstrual cycles (which eventually led to PCOS). But one of the first avenues they went down was a bleed time test, which showed she had VWD. My mom and I were asked to go for tests as well shortly after, and low and behold we both had VWD as well. Note that my sister and I are also O+, so it made sense that we would have gotten almost exact carbon copies of the faulty platelets. \n\nAnd while my mom\u2019s dad does not have an official diagnosis, he was often a bleeder as well in his youth and often was covered in bandages. And again, he also has the same blood type as us. \n\nIf you decide to go through with the prenatal testing (something you can chat with your OBGyn about), once you have the results medical professionals can help you from there. Extra blood can be on hand if infusions are needed for you or baby, and other such precautions can be made. They can get you connected with a hematologist so that by the time baby is born you are prepared to hit the ground running. Because her father had hemophilia and she received his only X chromosome, she is what is called an obligate carrier. All daughters of men with hemophilia A and B inherit the mutation, unfortunately. Hi, 33 year old male with severe hemophilia A here! The treatment for hemo is so much better now and there are even better options. You can also get a port for your baby so you you do not have to use needles to infuse. There is also the new med called hemlibra which looks promising. Your best bet is to find the nearest hemophilia treatment center and become established patients even before your baby is born. They can help answer questions and also make sure your factor leaves are safe for delivering a baby! I know this must be scary. My parents were terrified. But I turned out to be extremely athletic with very few bleeds through out my life. :) Hope this helps! Thank you! I really appreciate your response. Thank you. I think that is a good idea, checking in with them ahead of time. I did not even think about my factor levels, I have never had them tested. But I think it would set me at ease at least from that point of view to confirm that are in a normal range. Thank you again! Of course! And good luck with your beautiful new baby! I found out I am a carrier when I was a couple months pregnant with my son. We met with the hemophilia center and came up with a plan. They tested the cord blood when my son was born to see if they could get a good enough sample that would tell us if he had hemophilia. The results were inconclusive, which they said the test is a long shot but why not try to find out. They just tested him last month (he was 10 months old) and he has mild factor 9 hemophilia b. They said they usually do not test until the babies are about one year old so that their liver is more developed. They tested a little early becausey son was born with webbed fingers (syndactyly) and will be needing surgery early next year. I would meet with your hemophilia center and get a plan in place. When I first found out I was so nervous but having a plan and more education put my mind more at ease. If you ever want to chat feel free to message me \ud83d\ude0a. Thank you! Now you have made me curious about my nephew, I will mention it to my sister to see if he should be retested. He was tested at his first doctors appointment, and her doctors (OBGYN/PCP) did not tell her that he could even be tested from the umbilical cord or anything, so I doubt they know about waiting for liver development. \n\nI called my local treatment center to set up an appointment to have my factor levels checked, if notning else it will put me at ease. My doctor had to send a referral and the nurse had to ask me a couple of times \"what was it called again\" so that leads me little confidence in them. I think getting a relationship with the hemo doctor will be good just in case. I appreciate you and everyone else's suggestions!! My dad has mild hemophilia (level 13%) and was not diagnosed until he had a major surgery and his heart stopped 4-5 times and he almost died...yeah, not great.  I got pregnant and then did not get a blood test done until I was in my third trimester. I also have mild hemophilia (level 20%).\n\nWork with a good hematologist. I worked with a clinic and they were amazing. If you have \"expressed\" hemophilia, you will likely have to get infused with factor right before delivery and for a few days after.\n\nIf you have a boy, the hospital will not be able to use forceps or vacuum (which IMO, not using those is a good thing).\n\nI ended up having a girl (so I have not even bothered testing her yet for hemophilia). If you have a boy, there are extra precautions to take, but apparently hemophilia is not as big a deal now as it was even 20 years ago.  Just work with a good clinic/hematologist.\n\nAlso, people on this forum said that mild passes on as mild, etc. Not sure if that is true, but if your dad was not a severe hemophiliac, it is likely your kid may not be one either?  I think only severe hemophiliacs have it really bad.  The rest of us just have to worry about hemophilia when we get surgery/give birth.", "Any VWD have experience with copper IUD?

Thought I am a severe (Hem A) I very rarely bleed and this combined with the fact that I am quite young (15) means that I have very little experience with bleedings and I am not even sure how does it feel like because I was very young last time I had any bleeding (My hematologist says something along the lines that I have considerably fewer bleeds than average, which is something I am thankful for daily)\n\nWith this out of the way, these are my questions, yesterday my left knee started hurting, it weirded me out a lot, but it was infusion day and I though \"Meh, then it is ok\", so I infused myself and then went on with my day, sat in my chair and did homework **but**, once I got up In noticed it is still hurting, it is not a strong paing by any means, nor does it impede my mobility, as I can walk perfectly and I still can stretch my legs slightly above average. The pain is not directly in my joint but at the side. Problem is, it is not warm as I was told a bleed would be nor I can feel any inflammation, I will probably go to the hospital if my knee is still hurting two days from now, but I wanted your opinion so I could know if I can rest easy, infuse early and continue resting or I should be worry and go to the hospital as soon as I can? Rest is very crucial. If there is a little pool of blood inside due to being late to infuse, then it will take a day or two to subside.\n\nBut if the pain increases after a day of infusing, it is the sign that tells its not completely healed or is still bleeding. \n\nTake rest. If pain increases then visiting your hematologist is a good idea.

Oh yeah that is right, it was my longest through of the week, I might have been more rough with my body than I should have that day. I will do as you say! Hello, 23yo severe Hem A here. \n\nYou should generally be cautious of joint pains as Micro bleeds can do a lot of damage. Its more or less a new topic that started with the introduction of extended half life treatments. I was your age when the first one was released and immediately switched, my knees got significantly worse because of all the time I spent at lower factor levels. I ended up taking half doses often, tried every extended treatment with same results and then went back to kogenate I did not know this was an issue, (I am not using extended half life factors), but my hematologist is very adamant about getting me a new extended half life treatment before this year ends... should I be worried? My advise. Infuse again right now. Then stay off of it completely. Infuse again in 24 hours. And continue this until it is getting better enough to walk on without it feeling weird. I would continue infusing every 24 hours until it isnt noticeable anymore. This may seem like a heavy treating regimen but having a knee bleed that gets bad reall really sucks, and once you get one, they can keep happening unless you really let it heal. Do not mess around, it is just a few days, rather than a lifetime of this happening every few months. 4% is a huge difference compared to less than 1% (severe). I cannot be as laid back about bleeds. Especially knee bleeds. For me, anytime something hurts , it is a bleed. Same for me. I need the factor that has vonwillibrands in it as well. I use alphanate. The synthetic and longer lasting barely worked at all for me. It turns out some of us do not bind the factor 8 with vonwillibrands as easily as others. So alphanate has them both already bonded so my body does not have to. I am on Hemlibra now, but even now I still bleed more than most people on Hemlibra. It is a big improvement but I still infuse almost weekly for stuff. I am way more active so that is part of it, but also I just think I need that vonwillibrands factor and a factor 8 boost too to stop some stuff. Hemophilia is a lot more complex than a lot of people, even most hemophiliacs and hematologists realize. There are a lot of variations. FUCK i did not know it was so dangerous. luckily enogh, today I infused and walked very, very little. I will infuse again tomorrow and continue resting no doubt, thanks you very much for advice. Try not to worry too much. But yea take it seriously and you will be ok. I am 45 and still riding dirtbikes and all kinds of crazy stuff. Take care of yourself and be patient when you get bleeds and you will be good. And treat prophylactically. I get it, it really sucks having to sit around and put life on hold but it is worth it in the long run. It is just a few days usually. Sometimes a week or two. But if you do not let it get better that is when the problems really start. That can all be avoided. Take care man. Bust out the pen and paper or whatever gets you through it. dayumm... The extended work well for a lot of people, I just know that it did not help me. It does not hurt to try it out for a few months and see if it helps. My hematologist was understanding and was happy to help me search for the right factor. Do you have one of the missense mutations in the C domain? As a mild with lower levels it took my HTC forever to realize that I was bleeding and it was the vwf issue. That said, EHL works for me. I do not know what any of that means. Can you explain? All I thought I could do was get a vonwilibrands factor level test to see if that is low. It is good to check vwf levels... Some hemophilia mutations do not hind well to vwf, causing issues. Also, sometimes people are diagnosed as hemophilia because of low factor levels, but they actually have vwd.", "Question about hemlibra after trial Hey guys,  I have question, I just completed 6 months of my hemlibra trial not even one bleed for six months which is best 6 months of 21 years of life, so my question is, trial is for 2 years what is after that does roche provide any extra benefits for trial patients?

Some iron rich foods I eat are beef, bison, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, black beans and I drink an iron called Floradix. \n\nI have found having ample iron in my diet really significantly helps my energy levels Good stuff my guy, thank you! I remember reading in Journey by Robert Massie that before factor their son ate a lot of roasted peanuts. Not sure if it actually did anything or it was anecdotal evidence. I might have to try that out and see what it does for me, hopefully something good. I have always wondered if snake venom would help clot the blood. If you had no access to meds. No mention of peanuts on this list but I was unaware of the avoidance of fish oil and vitamin E.  It was tried in the past. Think the experimenting stopped when plasma was found to work better. Arnica for bruising, calcium for bones, sativa for the head \n\nI think it comes from this. In 1960 there was a story in the New York Times about it. That would have been about the same time period. I think they mentioned keeping a bag of peanut powder around. I will have to see if I can find the section and see if he discussed the source. Went and reread the section. That is the article Massie saw. His son was about 4years old, he was working at Newsweek, and he saw the article in the NYT. Said they gave it up soon since you needed take a lot and their son hated it. We were born with a genetic defect, no amount of tofu is going to fix it. After living through whole blood transfusions, cryoprecipitate, factor concentrates, heat treated factor concentrates, recombinant factor, and now Hemlibra it is a miracle that we have survived.

Thankfully I did not have to have a transfusion but I have lived through all the other stuff. 35. \n\nTaking care of our health is so important but I hope OP realizes there is no substitute and nothing that can improve, regulate, enhance, or perform anywhere near enough positive good to compare to the treatments that is natural. \n\nIt is as close to reality as the \u201cwish in one hand\u201d saying is. I would you are asking this, I have to assume you are experiencing a lot of difficulty with your disorder. My dad and grandparents came up with a whole packet of questions and lists of foods and supplements they wanted my doctor to go through like a homework assignment and provide information and context on, when I was young and having bleeding episodes all the time.\n\nIt was a waste of time and I summed it all up with the doctor by instead of giving them a list just asking them \u201cis there anything I can eat or not eat\u201d that would help. The answer was no.\n\nThere is nothing you can do on the \u201cnatural\u201d side that will ever even remotely compare to our meds. There is no food you can work into all your meals, no herbs you can take, nothing. I will add there are definitely herbs and foods you can have too much of that will fuck you up. Too much alcohol for one. \n\nWhat medications are you on for hemophilia? \nAre you in a country where you have access to a treatment center?\nDo you have a hematologist? \n\nI struggled with getting bleeds even on prophylaxis for years but hemlibra is a total life changer. If you can get access to it, do it. It is the only treatment that has ever made me feel \u201cnormal\u201d and made me okay with the decision to have kids, because the treatment is that damn good. As others have said, when it comes to hemophilia, there is really no substitute for medication.  A few diseases - like digestive diseases, or immune diseases, or diseases of uncertain cause - can maybe helped by diet.  I have a digestive disorder that I partially treat with diet and I feel it really helps.  Not at all true for Hemophilia.  You have a genetic mutation that means you are missing a protein (factor).  There is no way to get your body to make that protein.  The only treatment is factor, or now, hemilibra, which takes the place of factor.  The only natural \u201cremedy\u201d (moreso prevention) is consistent, light exercise to strengthen the joints.  It helps prevent bleeds but is not a cure and does not replace medicine. There is no substitute for the meds.

I figured it was from the friction of my jeans, socks, and leggings I had on to keep me warm. \n\nCut to a week later, I started feeling the weird, jelly/bubble feeling in my knee similar to when I jacked up my foot in high school - which was the only other bleed I have ever had. Knee still hurts to the touch, even my light sweat pants are killing me by laying on my knee.\n\nI am not on prophy and do not have to take factor unless I have surgery. I do not even have a Hemophilia specific doctor anymore (I moved out of state). I have my knee wrapped up, mainly because I hate the feeling of the jelly bubble in my knee bouncing around - ew gross. \n\nAt this point, is it too late to get some factor? My only options, since it is Friday and my endocrinologist's and pcp's offices are closed, is to go to the ER or Urgent care, and pay out the ass. \n\nIf I can get someone to call in a Rx for Stimate, do you think that would help/be enough? \n\nYes, I know I need to go to the doctor; I would just rather wait until Monday when I only have a $20 copay rather than a $300 one.

But after looking through the cdc website it seems like all the centers in Florida are for pediatrics and the only one that actually mentions adults is an 8 hour drive south for me. \nIs this common for hemophilia treatment centers to be for pediatrics?

Hey what is up, i have really severe hemophilia A and i have been missing a lot of school this year... its been really hard to keep up with everything and i was just wondering if anyone have had the same problem and what they did about it. Is this because of bleeds or because of appointments?? Either way, your school should be able to work with you, and let you keep medicine at the nurse's office, assuming this is HS. You can request a illness form from any of your doctors that are involved in treatment and they will fill it out and you give it to your school, this gives you more leeway with absence related to your illness. \n\nMost work can be done online/at home these days, does your school not already have an online platform? If not, have your parents or you talk with your school and see if there is anything you can do. I am sure teachers would be more than willing to give you a few 'passes'. Or just finish out your years online if you can. Idk how this would work with uni but if you just talk to them, I am sure there are more than a few online options to help there. Not because of appointments.. i can barely walk. my ankles are done. They mostlt let me get away with missing class but i still miss a lot of important stuff and they dont look very thrilled to have to do extra work to help me. My school dosent have any online platform and they dont look like they care that much. I just wanted to know if anyone got the same problem and what are the \"techniques\" or \"solution\" they have developed/found Oh man, I am sorry bud. it sounds like they are not doing their job very well then. Maybe someone else can be more helpful than me. Just make sure you know that you are not an inconvenience and it is their damn job to help make schooling easy and accessible to all their students. :) take care Thanks man :) it really helps when i can get some support :) I had the same problem when i was at school but i didnt really have much i could do about it, we had a very small online platform but it wasnt really good or used as much as it should, in the end i ended up doing an extra year but that year just ended up my worst for attendance so it didnt help a whole lot and now im just trying to focus on working and cant stand the idea of going back to education. What i would say to do is try and fight for the school to give you as much help as possible, my school did not do much of anything when they really should have, take it up with them, see if you can get your doctors involved if you have to to try and find out what you should be entitled to, its the schools job to make sure that youre getting as much of an opportunjty to get the most out of your education as everyone else That Is what im thinking of doing but its kind of hard... you know its kind of awkward for the rest of the year if they get forced to help you but i guess its my only option.. i really want to do well at school so i dont have to stay there any longer than i need.. Yeah i get you, its a tough situation and its honestly pretty terrible that schools arent doing as much as they should already.

I am glad I found someplace where I can relate to people, I do not know anyone with Von willebrands and am the first known to have it in my family.

Desmopressin raises my clotting levels but my bleeding does not stop or slow down so I am really confused about this, tranexamic acid has done nothing for me and I recently got a mirena coil inserted which I have bleed every day since insertion. Has anyone got any ideas what I could suggest to stop this. I feel I am at breaking point and nothing is working. Thanks. Hey, both my daughter and I have VWD. No one in the family seems to have it but us. I actually use the nuvaring for birth control. Depending on where you live. If you are in the US , especially in a major city there should be a hemophilia treatment center. Look them up and call and make an appointment with a hematologist. There are definitely ways to control your bleeding and not have so many problems with it. Some women do infusions to stop bad bleeding or surgeries, giving birth, etc. If you cannot get ahold of a HTC or they cannot help, keep looking. There are many people dealing with this and it is manageable. I work in hemophilia, if you need advise or have trouble finding resources message me and I can try to help. I am sorry you are going through this.  I had awful experiences with IUDs but found some BCPs very very effective at stopping my bleeding completely (I would just skip the placebo week).   I struggled for decades to find a decent hematologist but my OB/GYN is fabulous and since my periods are the worst part for me, too, it was enough to have her on my side.\n\nI second finding a hematology and thrombosis center near you, likely in your nearest big city or connected to a teaching hospital.  Hopefully they can actually help you long term! Hi. I have VWD and my three sons and one daughter also have it. \nMy daughter is 5yrs old. \nWe have discussed with our hemo team at Hershey Med in PA about what to do with her menstrual cycle when that time comes. They seem to believe birth control pill or implant and doing factor infusions will be her path. \n100% get in touch with your local (or closest) hematology clinic and get some more info on your exact remedies. \n\nI really hope you find something to help. You need to contact your nearest Hemophilia treatment center to get you on Factor Infusions.  Do you need help finding your closest HTC? I have a directory if you need it. \nHow are you tracking your blood loss? I track my menstrual bleeding by using a mesntrual cup to track how much blood I have lost. Another idea is to track how many pads, tampons you use per day and how many overnight. Also notate if the tampon or pad is super, super plus, etc as they have different absorption rates. \nPlease PM I am available to help more. Factor infusions will change your life Hi, type 1 vwd female in her 20's here. I started menstruating at 11 and did not know i had vwd until I was 14....those three years were awful for me every time I had my period. I went on birth control pills shortly after being diagnosed and while it took some trial and error to find one that worked for me, it changed my life for the better once I did. I am now 29 and still on them. I have looked into the iud a few times but everyone I know who has gotten them bled for a week or two (without having a bleeding disorder) and my gyno did not recommend them for me for that reason. Every once in a while I get a heavier than average period on birth control pills, and in those times I take Stimate as well to help. Echoing what others have said in this thread, look up and get in touch with your nearest specialist treatment centre if you have not already. You can look for your nearest one using the centre directory from the WFH (  \n\n\nSecondly, as a guy with haemophilia I can only say so much of course, but I have female friends with bleeding disorders and have worked on some research with nurses in the area too. Post insertion spotting can happen for a couple of weeks with IUDs but if its excessive bleeding this definitely needs to be addressed. I know some people with VWD who said a mirena coil made a huge difference for them but others who experienced no change in symptoms or had more issues. Everyone is different and treatment options need to be tailored to you as a individual (something a specialist centre should help with). Also, when it comes to periods there might be other underlying issues that are exacerbated by VWD too, so  communication between your OB/GYN team and haematology is important.  \n\n\nLastly, you mentioned your the only one known in your family to have VWD and you do not really know anyone else with it. Ofcourse this subreddit is a good starting point but be sure to reach out to your local haemophilia patient organisation. What country are you in? Despite most organisations specifying haemophilia they also serve the VWD community too but it might not be immediately obvious. You will be able to speak and meet with others with VWD. Meeting others with haemophiliac made a huge difference for me. Hope you get some solutions soon. Happy to answer any questions as best as I can too. Thank you! I am in the UK, I am seeing a Haemotologist occasionally but I definitely think I need to start seeing him more. Thank you, I am not keeping track but that sounds like a good idea! I am going to look into factor infusions. Thank you. I am in the UK, hoping this subreddit helps me understand more since it is all fairly new. Yea and maybe see if there are any Hematologists who are trained in hemophilia. It is a more complicated condition than most doctors understand. A lot of progress has been made in recent years with treatments and understanding the various ways different people are affected. I think that most women in your condition feel tired and need to supplement iron and other things due to bleeding. Plus I know as a hemophiliac that bleeding alone zaps your energy. When people are not treated properly it is possible to have micro bleeds that do not necessarily debilitate you but still take a toll on your overall well-being. I hope you can find someone who is knowledgeable and get the treatment and medicine you need. Recently they changed the diagnosis for symptomatic carriers (like my daughter) from calling it symptomatic carriers to mild hemophilia. Which means they are more likely to be prescribed factor infusions for bleeds. Instead of like in the past where women just bled more and had problems with arthritis and such, and they were not treated with factor (like my mom, two hip replacements and other problems from a lifetime of un treated bleeds). With proper treatment you do not have to go through that. For now I would recommend getting your iron levels checked and other vitamin levels , vitamin D, and a CBC blood panel to make sure you are getting the nutrients you need. You are almost definitely low in iron and vit D , and likely other stuff could be done to help that would be easy and you would benefit. If you are not already, start taking 5000 iu of vitamin D daily. Everyone can benefit from that especially with Covid happening. As was mentioned before, see a specialist for hemophilia. I am 31 and I was diagnosed whith VWD Type 2 at 27 after I nearly died because my period, which had always been very heavy, did not stop anymore.  I had a coil which worsed my period, so I got a birth control pill and skipped the pause, but I  nevertheless had minor bleedings. Finally, my  gynecologist contacted my hematologist and they decided together how to treat me. I know it is hard to find doctors who are that commited (she is the 9th or 10th I visited) but its worth the search. \n\nI finally do not take any hormons now and once the bleeding starts I take 2 pills of tranexamic acid 3 times a day plus iron pills and that works. I still bleed more than healthy women do, but it is managebale.  For pregnancy my doctor already told me that I will get a VW-Factor-transfusion so I can give birth like every other woman. Maybe this transfusion would be worth a try for you too - talk to your hematologist about it. \n\nWhat also helps: I use a menstrual cup so I can track the bleeding. It makes a huge difference if you tell a doctor: \" I bleed a lot. It is 400 ml every month.\" instead of \"My period is heavy.\" \n\nAll the best for you! Here to second the menstrual cup. Makes it easier to track, super cost effective, and environmentally friendly. I recommend always pairing with thinx (or other brand, you can search on Amazon) of period panties. Otherwise, you will have accidents. Just saying. Also, I honestly just need both anyway. \n\nI have vwd and mirena as well. Lots of women without bleeding disorders have told me that they do not get a flow anymore and I nearly cried. Mine is still very heavy even with the iud. Iron a day keeps the dizzies away. PS, if you are still bleeding from insertion and have not contacted your doctor yet to inform them/keep them updated, I would recommend doing that asap. Hey, sorry late to the game - I got my first mirena when I was about 22 (40now). I have severe VWD.\nThe way it was managed for me was to take the pill for the first 3 months too to allow it to settle in... are you managed by a centre that has a joint haem/gynae clinic? Two separate clinics but in the same part of the hospital and they communicate well! Good luck! But def recommend using the pill as cover until it settles. Also tranexamic acid of course! How did you manage hormones? I am struggling with my emotions from the mirena alone\ud83d\ude02 Lowest dose! Also your hormones on mirena are actually your own!! You will get used to them. The amount that comes from the mirena are teeny tiny! Coming back to this... how long did they let you take the pill for while having the coil? They told me no more than 3 months I think I did 3 months cover, seemed to settle after that. I also had factor cover for the first one which will have helped with initial bleeding. \n\nI still have periods with it but they are much better and basically regular. \n\nI will say that it does not work for everyone, and if you are still bleeding all the time I would go back to your doctor. You should have a check up soon anyway to check the position. \n\nHope it is ok!", "Factor XIII homozygote Hi. I tested as Factor XIII homozygote in 2019 after a stroke and other medical issues.

He is likely looking at a synovectomy in the near future but surgery frightens him so much that he does not want to talk about it, not even to his doctor. \n\nI would like to hear from the community.

What is the difference and which would be used in Ireland\n Haemophilia is the British/European spelling, hemophilia in the US and other countries that use U.S. English, but nobody's particularly going to bother you for using either. Haemophilia is the ~more coreect~ term, in that it is the original Greek/Latin term, while hemophilia is the modernized English word.  Right up there with Aluminum or Aluminium. ", "Funny Tips for Living With Hemophilia ", "FVIId - Factor 7 Deficiency Hey everyone.\n\nMy 5 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with Factor VII Deficiency -- Per NORD, she is one of 200 cases worldwide, and currently about 5% of those cases are pediatric cases. It is so rare that a large children's hospital in our area has not only diagnosed her as the first ever for the hospital, but up until now, they have never treated a case.\n\nWe have been really supported by the local hemophilia foundation groups around us, and it is been great -- but there is questions that we have not yet been able to get understanding on.\n\nIs FVIId a form of hemophilia? Per NHF, it is listed as a 'Rare Blood Disorder', but nowhere have we found data relating to it being any form of hemophilia -- though it mimics hemophilia in several ways. Like Hemophilia A and B, her blood does not clot due to a missing protein; however, due to the missing protein (and unlike hemophilia) she has *zero* clotting factor, making bleeding pretty substantial. She is also prone to bruising, joint bleeds, and gastrointestinal bleeds as well as head bleeds. \n\nAlso, there is multiple questions (and so far we have received multiple answers) regarding FVIId, and how it comes to be. We have been told that FVIId is genetic, and is passed from the parents through the 13th chromosome; however, we have also been told it could be a mutation generally based on a traumatic event - however, NORD notes that it is root cause is from a mutation of the F7 gene. While there is been no trauma, it leads us to believe it is genetic -- however, they have no way of doing any genetic testing for it, outside of testing our factor levels with a aPTT test.\n\nIf anyone has any information about FVIId, please feel free to PM me. I am trying to gather as much data as I can! First, I am sure you have had a scary few years before the diagnosis finally came. So I am sorry you had to deal with that. Luckily things will get easier now, and like you mention, the community is very welcoming and helpful.\n\nNominally I do not know if FVII deficiency is hemophilia but as you mention, for all intents and purposes, it is. Hemophilia A and B refer to specific deficiencies and I do not know if the scientific community is really going to expand on calling other deficiencies \"hemophilia\" from here on out. But it is still covered under the umbrella of causes advocated by groups like the NHF and other bleeding disorder groups (similar to von Willenbrand).\n\nThere is a commercially available recombinant FVII medication, which is good. As far as I know, the only product that is FVII is Novoseven, which I believe is used by patients with inhibitors, but I am not positive on that. On the one hand, this is widely available from specialty pharmacies so you can (and probably should) have it at home, and insurance companies know about it and have a protocol on how to bill for it. On the other hand, you are more of a captive market than many of us who have many more commercial options for us. Depending on where you live, administering the medication you have at home can be relatively easy or something you and your daughter may need to learn to do yourself. I live in Texas and I cannot bring my FVIII with me to any clinics or hospitals, unfortunately, so I either have to go to the emergency room and have them order factor for me (which can take hours) or I can infuse at home (which specialty pharmacies can also help you with).\n\nAs far as genetics versus mutation, it seems like it would be testable by doctors. A hematologist may have to do it. Depending on the type of test, factor assay levels can be unreliable (my sister had a test done twice, and came back with two difference answers) due to variance on a day-to-day basis. With hemophilia A, I have heard within the last year that about 30% of the cases have no family history of bleeding disorders, but that may not be applicable to a FVII deficiency, of course. I wish I could be more helpful on testing in case you are planning to have more children. It is crucial information to have.\n\nSo, in short: your daughter may not be a hemophiliac by name, but groups like the NHF, WHF, et al definitely advocate for her and anyone with a bleeding disorder. The NHF is having its national conference in August in Chicago this year, and will often sponsor first-time attendees if you are interested. Learning to infuse at home will be tough, but it will also make dealing with bleeding episodes less stressful and more importantly get treatment faster and cheaper than hospitals will be able to provide it, and it is a skill she will have for life. And unless the market has changed, the product you are most likely going to be infusing will be Novoseven, which specialty pharmacies most likely can handle from start to finish for you in getting it to your family. ( does a lot of programming around the ultra-rare bleeding disorders, including a (\n\nIn addition to what /u/bessle posted, you should try to attend the ( at least once.  This year, it is in Providence, RI in early April.  HFA will definitely scholarship you to attend for the first time (including hotel and airfare), but the deadline may have passed for this year.  All clotting factor deficiencies are hemophilias.  Factor 8 and 9 account for about 90-95% of them and all the others make up the rest.  It is genetic, but unlike hemophilia A and B, it is not X-linked so she could have inherited it from you and neither you or your wife may have any sx.\n\nI teach my students to think of the protein part of the clotting system like an old fashioned crystal radio.  You have an antenna, tuner, and amplifier, and a speaker.  In the clotting system, factor 7 is the antenna, it turns on the system when it reacts with tissue factor.  The signal from the amplifier is too weak to be useful and is amplified thousands of times.  The amplified signal makes a clot.\n\nIn her case, she will need a small dose of factor 7 once in a while, but in the case of a kid with hemophilia A and an inhibitor antibody, they need a  ton.  Like Marconi said about radio, \"want a bigger signal, put more iron in the air.\"  She will not need these big inhibitor doses.\n\nGenetic testing for factor 7 would be a research test.  NORD or the CDC/National Heart Blood Lung Institute might be able to direct you.", "Recommendations for CBD cream? Hi guys..I suffer from pretty bad ankle arthritis in my right ankle.

Just wondering. Its happend VERY rarely but it happend now and just want to know how bad is it if i accidently inject a small amount of air. Like those air bubbles you see somtimes. Cause i pulled it out and it made that sound that it either got stuck or had air in it. It seemed to inject correctly which is why im confused. I pulled to see if it was stilll in the vein and everything. I use the 24hour medicine btw. Its fine. The biggest danger with injecting air into a vein is embolism, and you typically need to inject a very large amount of air for that to be a risk. Small air bubbles are pretty harmless. Like i usally feel the cold liquid but i didnt this time Sometimes the needle can rest up against the inside of the vein.  If it was not in the vein you would see swelling and have pain.  Like the previous poster said, some air bubbles are fine.  You would need CC's of air for an embolism. Ty There is a test that uses 1cc of air mixed with your own blood.  So yea...   It is a lot of air.\n\nNot to mention, before the recombs that came out in the 90s (which DIDNT have HIV, only HepC) we had to go to the hospitals and sit there for a few hours while \"frosty orange juice\" was pumped into us.

You are even more old school than me! Made a comment to my Hematologist once in conversation about air in the line. And how ridiculous those moments in movies are when the assassin visits the victim in the hospital to \"finish the job\" and kills them with a teeny tiny quarter inch long bubble in the line... \n\nHe laughed and agreed how ridiculous those are. And then very casual and matter of factory laid out: \"yeah, I would say as long as you have decent vascular health it would take an entire syringe of air to really truly be a danger.\" Considering his history, education, and the fact that the man is a research fellow and a professor for bleeding conditions I would take that statement as fairly reliable. lol... yea... Life was rough.  Could write a story about it but it would be too sad to read!   But, always move forwards.  Always had to tell myself \"This will take time, but i will get better.\"\n\nNow, I am old, and that shit do not work anymore!  LOL!!!    If I do not joke about it, i will go mad\n\nBut, my cryo story was to say that I would watch bubbles after bubbles flow into my arms.  Not any of these fancy cathater needles either - the big metal ones that if you moved, they would blow the vein.\n\nAnd I swear the nurses were fucking sadists...

Hemophilia was only prevalent in royal families because the life expectancy back then was 13 for a Hemo, if that. So if you were a prince, they were rich enough to keep you alive at least until you had kids! That is my theory anyway, and I prefer it. Plus with the understanding of genetics now we know that is not how inbreeding works.  I think that, and stong genes kept hemophilia in the gene pool. \n\u2026Yea I think of all the what if\u2019s, mostly when I am hurt, but I have actually done a lot of cool stuff, more than most people I know my age.

I am glad I am not some ignorant prick that has never had anything difficult to overcome. I know it is all relative, everyone is pain is valid and all that, but I am thankful for the pain. It is over now of coarse. But I am not as fearful of the inevitable. I heard someone who had a stroke say- \u201cI do not wish you the stroke, I wish you the grace from the stroke\u201d.

There is usually a common thread they share that is admirable. I want to go to one of those big meetings again. I went to the mann meetings when I was around 17 or 18. Those were cool, they would have been better under different circumstances. But I had a blast. A bunch of us went and saw Jimmy Cliff after one, and Yes after another. The combination of that and all the pot smoke blew my young mind! If you have been to any of those meetings I bet we know some of the same people. I started avoiding everything hemophilia related in my 20\u2019s tho, just bleeds were more than enough hemophilia for me to deal with. Plus the trauma of it all got to be too much I think.

So he ordered the relevant parties to work toward making the UK self sufficient in blood products within a reasonable time scale. \n\nThen the government of which he was part was voted out and the new head of the department - either directly, or allowing those who were theoretically under his control - suspended that programme and parts of the UK carried on obtaining blood products from America.\n\nI was under the Haemophilia Centre in Cambridge, where all the blood products were obtained from the Blood Products Laboratory in Elstree (known as 'bpl', from their logo). Only one haemophiliac there got AIDS, although quite a few got Hep C (including me).\n\nThe Newcastle Haemophilia Centre, however, purchased its blood products from an American supplier. I heard, but I do not know how true it is, that *everyone* there got AIDS.\n\nI am puzzled about what you call 'recombinates'. What I know is 'recombinant' Factor VIII, and the reason it has replaced other factors used in treatment is that *because it is not made from pooled human blood,* it cannot infect the patient with blood-borne diseases, such as AIDS and HepC. But you seem to think it had a risk of AIDS - unless \"recombinates\" is not the same thing as 'recombinant factor VIII'. What can you tell me about that? Yup.   Everyone got AIDS.   I got hepC.  Wasted 15 months of my life feeling like I was on my deathbed...  for nothing.  Thanks pegalated interferon  (angry).    Thanks Harvoni for getting rid of it with no side effects in 3 months.  Insane...\n\nTBH, I do not remember exactly what it was that the Center wanted to give me.   It was the early 80s.  What I am talking about is the pooled human blood.  \n\nI will have to ask my parents a bit more.  I am just thankful I am alive, after the life i have been through Recombinant products are definitely not made from pooled blood, that was their USP. 'Recombinates' sounds like 'recombinant' but I do not know for sure that they are the same.\n\nWhat was being pushed in the 80s and early 90s was heat-treated Factor VIII, the heat treatment supposedly destroying the AIDS virus. But as one doctor said to me - \"it does seem to destroy the virus, but we do not know why\". There we go.   That rings a bell.\n\nMonoclate P....\n\nThat name rings a bell, as well ( &gt;The boys and young men participating in the studies of r factor VIII were overheard saying, \"This is so exciting, being on the cutting edge of science!\"\n\nLOL.

Recently got a reevaluation letter  (for medicaid) in the mail, filled it out and went to the office. They look at my file and there is already red flags with the case. For some reason it was paying my medicare premium, which they said is not supposed to be the case. I make too much to get the medicaid where they pay for everything, so they are telling me if i stick with the medicaid and get on a certain plan with it (which i think they said i could not get anyways) it would be about 1000 per month out of pocket. Which is half of my monthly income. (it gets even wierder, apparently I am already declined for not having filled out the paperwork on time even though the paperwork i did get I filled out a week before the due date. this is not the first time I have never gotten something in the mail from the medicaid offices or something has been really weird with them. Like they never sent me my card (was always using the numbers they gave me for it) despite having them resend it thrice and double checking the address)\n\nSO they said i would probably have to buy into the market place, which still looks expensive as fuck. My HTC said something about buying medicare supplemental (i do not know much about that right now, but my brother said something about it costing about $400 bucks a month, which does not seem to unreasonable, but with my current financial situation it would make things more difficult than they already are). \n\nNow I have been doing some reading, apparently Iowa has a much more lenient program for medicaid for disabled workers. I work in iowa anyways and have been looking to move. My gross income is roughly 2000 (if you count the disability check). Maybe it is time to consider moving to Iowa? Or is it just as bad over there as it is here in illinois?", "Ankle fusion is in my future. I know many fellow hemos have had this done. What is the turn around time?

Also probably loss of muscle in the calf (I now have chicken legs mostly because I am lazy and do not like weight training).\n\nOn the plus side, I really enjoyed driving around the electric scooters at the grocery store. And now I have zero pain in either ankle. Good luck. Hey Drew, have you talked to your doctors about a arthroscopic synovectomy?

When pulling back on the syringe I am not getting hardly any blood return. Continuing to push factor I do not get any bubble under the skin near the vein.\n\nI typically shower before infusing and have been losing weight/doing Keto. Is this something I should be concerned about? Shitty syringe or needles?\n\nThanks in advance! Yes i would be concerned. Getting lumps under your skin is a sign that you have missed the vein completely.\n\nYou should always get blood return/draw back when you are in the vein. I will put the needle under my skin in the vein, draw back, make sure it is in the vein, begin pumping, and periodically draw back to make sure there is still blood coming up the tube, to ensure it is in the vein. It should come up the tube easily, if you have to pull hard on the syringe, and you only see a small amount of blood in the tube, you have probably missed. \n\nIf you start getting a lump under your skin you should take the needle out and try a new vein, because you have missed the vein and are just pumping the medicine in to the muscle tissue. \n\nI like to drink 2 big cups of water before doing my medication, I have found that it helps make my veins more plump. \n \nI have been injecting my own medication for 21 years now (I feel old). Thank you very much! I decided to re-stick and had no problems in another vein. Appreciate the support!!! You can do it! I still miss all the time! Last week I had 3 bandaids on my hands... It happens to everyone. So sometimes the bevel of the needle can be sitting up against the top of your vein. It could allow factor to come out of the needle if there is pressure behind it, but when there is negative pressure that would normally pull blood back into the needle, it instead pulls the vein against the bevel. This would make it difficult to pull anything back. When that happens, i try to push the needle in a bit more, or move it around a bit. Of course this could push it through the other side of the vein, so be careful. That is my understanding anyway. That happened to me last 2 months ago. Do you drink plenty of water before infusing? Do you eat sweets? I always do it on my median cubital vain. Whenever I poke it, there is a blood flowing but after I put a saline it swells because the blood will not flow anymore. So instead, I poke myself now on my hands. I like to wash my hands first in hot water so I can get more veins. It is good to exercise or use stressball so you can get more veins in your hands.

In north Texas my partner and I work with Lonestar Hemophilia and Texcen and through their guidance and some of our own we have met with our state rep and senator to discuss bleeding disorder issues. I actually received a call from my state rep a couple weeks ago before she voted in support of a bill on step therapy, straight from the capitol floor thanking me for bringing it to her attention.\n\nSince part of the AHCA is giving states the power to opt out of protections previously granted, I think local advocacy is just as important depending on your state, and it is relatively easy to maintain relationships with local legislators.

I have a question about this oxford vaccine for us hemophilics. Let me preface this by saying that I am in no way an antivaxxer, but India and Nepal have authorized the emergency use of Oxford vaccine. \n\n     Now looking through the vaccine\u2019s compostion i saw that it was made using adenovirus particles, sorry if this sounds extremly naive but isnt adenoviruses used for gene therapy for hemophilics? If this vaccine makes us immune against adenoviruses wouldnt we not be able to use genetherapy since their vector is an adenovirus too? I cannot answer that. But it seems like getting the coronavirus vaccine could save your life. And not doing that so you could hold out hope for a possible  gene therapy treatment that may or may not ever work or come to market at some unknown future date does not seem a worthy trade off to me. Besides, I do not think it is going to interfere, but I do not know. I doubt anyone does. &gt;coronavirus vaccine could save your life\n\nYes that is a valid point, but we here dont have access to factors. Gene therapy will be a game changer where there is virtually no factors. But thanks for the advice, I will be asking this to our hematologist as well. I am really sorry to hear that. I hope something comes along that works for you. They cannot give you factors, but will be able to provide ~$2M drug? Factors for 10-20years would cost more, no? I heard factors are quite expensive too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Yeah, but you said there is no factor help at all. No factors is cheaper My understanding is that the vaccine uses a non-human adenovirus. Additionally, I believe most hemophilia gene therapy uses AAV (adeno-associated virus) vectors, which is not an adenovirus at all. Previous trials of gene therapy using adenovirus vectors do exist, but I do not believe they were safe/successful. If you are still concerned, I would contact your physician. \n\nSee below for info from The NY Times.\n\n\u201cThe Oxford-AstraZeneca team used a modified version of a chimpanzee adenovirus, known as ChAdOx1.

I am a 20 year old male and I was diagnosed when I was six due to heavy nosebleeds. When I was tested my VWF antigen level was around 40. Normal levels are about 50-200. I have also read published medical journals written by the former president of the American association of hematology that states that a diagnosis with the only symptoms being nosebleeds is inappropriate because of the fact that so many people with normal VWF levels have the same amount of nosebleeds. He also states that a diagnosis for type one should not occur unless one has VWF antigen below 15. Because of all this information would it be possible for me to claim that my diagnosis should have never happened in the first place. I feel that this may be hard because my diagnosing doctor was doctor Valentino, who is now the CEO of the national hemophilia foundation. Any input would be great thank you. I would not definitely bring it up to your hematologist and have then retest. Nice job in the research Talk with your HTC and get a retest.  It is common, especially in men (but in both genders) to have the level of VWF increase over time.  Especially from 40%.  Get tested and document normal status.\n\nThe 15% rule is a debatable point.  The crowd that favors that wants to have VWD type 1 be purely the clinically severe.  Most hematologists understand that there is overlap between type O blood patients and normal variants at 40% and we no longer are willing to call type 1 VWD at that level unless stably at that level and symptomatic.  That said, I have a lot of VWD patients in the 30-40% range who are stably there and do not have other reasons to have the low level. Thanks for the input are you a hematologist?  So if I am reading that correctly you are saying that if levels are stable at 40% then the chances of reversing my diagnosis would be slim? What about the fact that I have never had any major bleeding. Nowadays I get maybe 2 nosebleeds a month and they stop after less than like 2 minutes in most cases when I apply pressure. I am a pediatric hematologist.  If your level is stable at 40%, then you likely have mild type 1 VWD.  Your hematologist can go over this with your data specifically. What is your goal in \"reversing\" your diagnosis? If it is for something like employment in an industry that screens for bleeding disorders (police, fire, military, etc.) or for life insurance, your diagnosis will still be be present in your medical history. You would have to fight to get it expunged/corrected, but it is a tough battle these days. I am hoping to enlisting the Army. I would maybe just lie but I would rather get the diagnosis off my record. I am awaiting my test results but I think because of the fact that I do not present with any symptoms I have a pretty good shot of no longer having anything.", "Is getting a synovectomy/radiosynovectomy a good idea? I am fairly new to this thread, I found it a while ago and this is my first time posting, first off ill do a little introduction. I am a Severe A hemophiliac, I was diagnosed at birth since my brother has the exact same. I have and have had inhibitors to Facor 8 for pretty much as long as I can remember, so I use NovoSeven when I need it to treat bleeds, Factor 8 still works for a small amout of time and would only be used in case of emergencies. I also use a port, I have only ever had 2, and I have been using my current one for about 11 years now. (it still works well, and does not move around often enough that its a bother, be I think it will probably be gone sometime in the next few years) also, I just turned 16.\n\nSo I have most of my bleeds in my knees, I have occasional ankle bleeds, and very few in my arms, but my knees is where I have the most problems. Recently I have had quite a lot of bleeds in my right knee, each one usually taking around a week to heal, and re-bleeds occasionally happening aswell, because of this there is been talk of possibly getting another synovectomy or a radiosynovectony done on my knee. (I had one done on my left knee when I was 5 and it was a pretty big success) or, I could not get it and carry treating them as they come and try and just strenghthen my knees up, hopefully reducing bleeds.\n\nI am really not sure what would be the better idea, I have started to do regular physio, but y'know, I am a lazy teen and its usually not my number 1 priority, me and my brother want to start doing things together, he wants to get me out more and toughen me up, but bleeds have postponed that for a while. I do feel confident that if I started i could strengthen up quite a lot, but I also have quite a lot to do in the upcoming future, I have got exams to do, I am going to do my drivers test as soon as I can, I have got to think about what I want to take in college, what I want to do when I leave school and probably a lot of other things along the way, and I have allready started to see bleeds having some big effects, I was not able to take my exams last year, which was not really a big deal, but I am scared that it will screw up my exams this year, which are not that far away either. My attendance has really been hit hard due to bleeds, it is somewhere around 50% - 60% and its difficult to catch up, especially when I miss 1 - 2 weeks at a time. I think that if I got the synovectomy/radiosynovectomy, even if it is not necessary, and it helps me in these next couple of years then I will be able to do so much more then if I continued what I am doing now. They say I am a prime candidate for these procedures, I have never had any infections or broken bones, I never seem to spontaneously bleed and there is never really a pattern to my bleeds, and they are never usually a problem for longer than a week with treatment.

As far as I know it is a German company, but I think it is made on the west coast of the us?\n\nNot completely sure, it is something I remember hearing at some point since I have started Ok, so no worries about production/shipment? Yep, as far as I know there should be no issues Do not worry. Shut off the TV. This whole thing is asinine. Seriously, from what information are you making the statement that most Hemophilia products are manufactured in China?\n\nI would say all manufacturers have safety stock of finished product to deal with production issues, specifically the inability to produce due to whatever. Safety stock thresholds vary from company to company, and even product to product.\n\nI am not currently worried.

I (severe A) spent about 6 years as a flooring installer in my late teens and early 20s.  Did not really impact me then but the damage is cumulative and I am paying for it now.  If I was on a prophy schedule back then it would have made a big difference but there were times when available factor was an issue so nobody was offering me that sort of treatment plan.  As long as you keep yourself safe and know your limits you will probably be OK but even healthy guys in physical jobs pay for it in the long run. If you really enjoy it, learn the business and hire others to do the heavy lifting. I have been worried about it taking a toll on me as I get older(I am 27 now) and I do love the work it the best job I have ever had. I have been looking into a prophy I cannot remember the name but it is a shot that lasts for over three months and talking to my boss about changing my insurance to cover it.

Is it safe to have them injected by a doctor who does'nt know much about haemophelia.\nWhat should I be careful about.\n\nWeight= 69 kg\nAge= 24 yo &gt;So i wanted to know about the doses and side effects (if there are)\n\nDosing (incl. dosing calculator): \n\nSide effects: \n\nAll the previous hemlibra threads we have had on this sub:  Oh man. There is more to this medicine than I can explain to you in summary on here. Send me a personal message and let us talk. It may not be helpful for you at all to start injecting Hemlibra if you only have a 2 month dose, as there is a \u201cbuilding dose\u201d period of a month or two before your body reacts properly and the mechanism that hemlibra delivers on takes affect. I can explain better if we talk. As far as I am aware your explanation of loading doses is a little off. The half-life of hemlibra is estimated at around 1 month, but normal treatment regiments involve injecting more often than that. Thus, the initial loading period is there to build the dose high enough that subsequent doses replace all of the factor cleared over a given time period. If you did not load you would eventually reach the same factor level that you have if you do load, but it would take substantially longer. \n\nAs a secondary point, there is nothing fundmentally wrong with lower concentrations of hemlibra in the blood, just that you will not achieve the same degree of clotting. Hemlibra's dosing has been pretty carefully fine tuned to achieve maximum possible clotting, with the caveat that concentrations beyond a certian point actually reduce effective clotting, as hemlibra molecules start to out-compete each other binding to factor molecules. All of that is to say that injecting hemlibra for two months will give some clotting, though obviously less than could be achieved with proper loading and long term dosing. Above all I would still recommend OP try to contact a hematologist to get better advice. Maybe this link will help?\n\n Cool. How hemlibra works is a hard thing to understand. I still was under the impression that if you take too little, or take it and stop, and start again, that it might not be as affective. I would be cautious. \n\nOn another note,  I have a little bit of Hemlibra left every week at the bottom of the bottle. If we all pooled our unused doses and coordinated we might be able to  help this kid. It would take around 8 people or so, depending on his weight and stuff. Sending other peoples opened prescription medication through customs would be a problem tho. Wishful thinking. \nIt might still work if people all lived in the same city. Maybe there would be contamination problems. But if you had a Hemlibra party and did it at the same time, that would work. All we need is 8 people and some coordination and one person gets free meds. And no one is any worse off for it. &gt;On another note, I have a little bit of Hemlibra left every week at the bottom of the bottle.

Do you even know what \u201cwishful thinking\u201d means? I was writing a silly thought process , getting to the idea that strength in community can be helpful. Your literal (miss)interpretation just illustrates your level of ego blindness. You see what you want to see, and everyone who does not think like you is wrong. Nothing I said was to be taken literally, except by a fool who cannot understand that people can express ideas in jest, light heartedly. If you cannot read between the lines and see that it was not meant to be taken as advise I feel sorry for you. The fact that you feel emboldened to attack people with your pretentious condescending tone is just sad. It is sad that you cannot see what anyone with a little bit of insight into their psyche can see. That you feel small and inadequate. So you find what to you are flaws in others processes in order to inflate your own false sense of importance. No one likes people who do that. So go away please. It is clear from your history of insensitive comments toward patients in countries without full access to comprehensive treatment that you think of them as lesser. If you want to embrace it, that is your call, but your poor attempts at deflection when someone points it out are downright Trumpian. Wow. Now you are attacking my character? Based on what? You are so far off. It is amazing someone could be so presumptuous and dense. I really should not be feeding the troll. But if you equate helping people who need help with them being lesser that is on you. I am not going to debate you on your distorted world view when it is painfully clear that you have no idea what you are talking about or who you are talking to. You completely misread the comment you started attacking me on, and I am sure you also misread any other comments of mine while scouring my comment history to come to that far cry conclusion. Why do not you take a quote out of context (like a good journalist) from some of my past comments to further your ridiculous assumption that my thinking is somehow Trumpian. This is a hemophilia sub. Not the appropriate place for an adolescent pissing contest. Like I said the last time this happened with you- get your last word in so you can feel like you won, then go away. I am a sucker for taking the bate. You do not bother to read anything into what I say beyond what you want to hear. That is your own short sighted lack of understanding to blame. It is truly idiotic to assume you know anything about someone is beliefs by reading a few sentences they wrote. As well as assuming the healthcare system where I live is providing excellent access to treatment, out of all of the countries in the world? You do not get it. Unless you have lived here you would not. You clearly know very little about what you are talking out your ass about. Like it is some kind of contest and whoever has less access to medical care wins? Or because I live here I am  automatically a fascist? Because I have tried to help people without factor get it, that somehow makes them lesser? Because I have become invested in people\u2019s lives and done the little bit I could do be supportive of people in need I am getting attacked by you for it? Perhaps you are only reading through the limited lens of your distorted perception, and all you see is you? Your reflection. There is a word for people who do that. Asshole.

", "Reaction to Advate ? Hi all\n\nMy dad is a mild to moderate haemophiliac. Last year he had a bad nose bleed which lead to getting his nose packed in A&amp;E. That gave him an infection and long story short he has been suffering for over a year now, in and out of hospital. Not only did he have a bad bleed after the sinus operation but he got various infections which still are not gone. Today he has incredibly bad pain in his joints, one knee more than the other. \n\nHe is at the hospital and they are testing for internal bleed tomorrow I think on his joints. But it is strange as he has not been doing any heavy lifting or anything we can think of that could cause internal bleeding. He is on strong antibiotics for the nose infection and has recently been taking the latest version of Advate. I was wondering, has anyone had any bad side effects with Advate?\n\nAny insight would be helpful.\n\nThanks all No bad side affects, but for me the old blood based stuff works better because the factor 8 is already bonded with the VonWillebrand\u2019s factor, instead of your body having to recognize it and do the work. I had a bleed that would not stop when I switched to synthetic factor, and it finally stopped and I was able to control bleeds using Advate. It is not uncommon for some hemophiliacs to respond better to the old factor. And it is safe now, so there is no reason not to try it. It sounds to me like this might be the case for your father. Do not be surprised at all if your factor salesman does not agree with me. It is possible your dr will not know about this either. But I know that the people who have worked in hemophilia the longest and have the real knowledge are well aware that the old blood products work much better for some people. Think about it, I would bet that could be what is up. Thanks so much for your response. \n\nHe was getting constant top ups of factor 8 whilst his operation healed. Turns out the hospital did not have his most up to date info so did not realise he needed to be on it constantly as his body was not retaining it. Anyway, it is been about a month or 6 weeks since he was given the Advate. Do you think it could still be linked to the pain he is experiencing now? Thanks again! If he was not infusing enough to keep the nose bleeds under control then it is likely that the worsening of his joints was due to having his factor depleted. I guess it could be a systemic infection but it seems like if it were that he would know it by now, or the bloodwork would show there is a more serious infection. \nAny time I have one bleed, others start easier too because all of my factor is being used. If I had a serious bleed (or just one that was not stopping) I would have to infuse 3000-4000 units every 8-12 hours during the worst bleeding, then every day for maybe a week based on how I am feeling, then every other day at least for the foreseeable future or until the bleed was completely healed.  If I do not do that, it is not at all uncommon to have smaller bleeds (joints , muscles) that pop up , or trickle bleed until I am sore everywhere. It sounds like he was being under treated. Nose bleeds are not considered as serious as joint bleeds or whatever, but they can still be very hard to treat and use a lot of factor. He should be infusing prophylactically, every other day at least until his body is back to where he is comfortable imo. I have been through this enough to know that this is what the most knowledgeable hematologists would recommend. But it is not at all surprising that a hematologist that is not experienced in treating hemophilia would not know how to treat properly.  I weigh 190 and need 3000-4000 units per dose, and that is considered high for most people, but it is what it takes for me to stop even the smaller bleeds. If he has access to factor do not be afraid to treat aggressively. I know it is a pain to infuse daily , or often at all, but a lot of the time it is what it takes. I hope this helps. I used it back in 2004 and it did not work. I got a bleed on my right elbow and Advate did nothing to stop it. Long story short, I lost range of motion because I was on Advate. Hemofil M has always worked for me the best. I am 29 and the incident happened when I was 14. It works for my cousin who is also a severe hemophiliac but did not help me in the slightest. Hi thanks again for your response. I wanted to update you in case this info could be useful in the future. From what I understand his immune system attacked the Advate and his natural levels of factor 8 which caused his factor 8 levels to drop. \n\nHe then had some internal bleeding around the stomach which caused horrible pain in his knees. This bleeding has now been pretty much stopped. The doctor said they had two options... they can flood his body with the Advate to get it used to it (I think I understood this correctly) and if that does work he will try Hemlibra. \n\nEither way it is been problem after problem this last year or so with doctors in A&amp;E not understanding his condition and delaying treatment. He is almost lucky this bleed happened though because else the doctors would not have discovered his natural factor was depleting. \n\nWe will be writing to the hospitals to complain and flag this issue as I am sure other haemophilia patents have the same problem. \n\nWhere do you live if you do not mind me asking? And have you found A&amp;E treatment to be an issue? Thanks for your response. I think he is going to try Hemlibra now I do not know what A&amp;E treatment is. I am in the US. It sounds like he developed an inhibitor to Advate. It is common. I would switch to Hemlibra ASAP. If you were at a hemophilia treatment center and they knew what they were doing this could be handled many ways, depending on how his factor level drops after infusing. It is called a factor 8 assay. It is a series of blood test taken after a dose of factory that determines how long it stays in your system. They would also do tests to see if he has developed an inhibitor to factor 8 and to what level. But if you are not in a place that is capable of this level of care I would suggest starting Advate and keep your fingers crossed.Hemlibra  works even if you have an inhibitor to factor 8. If your Dad does have an inhibitor, they would do all the tests then just put him on Hemlibra  anyway. And the cost of giving him massive amounts of Advate to eliminate the inhibitor would be a lot more $ than Hemlibra , so it seems like your insurance or whoever makes those decisions based on cost would be ok if you asked to just start Hemlibra. I do not see the point of trying to eliminate his inhibitor since 1, it might not work, and 2, even if it does he will likely want to start on Hemlibra in the future anyway since it is a better product for so many of us. I hope this helps. \nSorry, I edited this because I kept calling Hemlibra advate ( Arts and entertainment? Yes, the Emergency Department is not the ideal place for a hemophiliac to get treatment.

So my dad\u2019s factor 8 was much lower than normal and he did not realise so was doing his usual thing. Working in the garden, shopping etc, lifting things, nothing crazy strenuous but not taking extra care either.\n\nHe does not recall hurting himself where the bleed happened (near the stomach) which he thinks is quite strange. I just wondered if this was normal? Can a bleed be caused by normal activity? \n\nSorry for all the questions but I have not been able to speak to any of the doctors.\n\nThank you Yea bleeds can be caused by anything at all, or by nothing too. Spontaneous bleeds happen often when your factor level is low enough. Does your dad know what his factor level is? Either way, the answer is yes, bleeds can happen with no trauma in people with hemophilia. Especially if you have another bleeding episode happening around the same time because your factor 8 is being used up. There are other things that will make you more likely to have bleeds. I was getting a lot of muscle bleeds for years and I finally had my testosterone level checked and it was around 60, normal is between 250-1100. Without testosterone your muscles will not repair themselves and do not work right. So I started testosterone replacement and writhing a few weeks my muscles stopped bleeding. The change has been unbelievable. I wonder how many hemophiliacs suffer from low testosterone. Mine was low from pain killer use from chronic pain. I do not take pain killers now either, I do not think they help in the long run, and they definitely mess you up in so many ways that are hard to recover from. Anyway, my point is that a lot of things can affect your bleeding. But having low factor 8 (in a hemophiliacs case) is by far the most important. The other possible things are a small part of it. Testosterone is the only thing I have found that drastically changed how I bleed, but I think that is just in my case, maybe it is affecting your dad? The only way to know for sure is to have a blood test. It is an easy test, I would recommend it just Incase. Low testosterone is common among middle aged men. So long answer. Short answer , yes.", "Anyone Have Wisdom Teeth Extractions with VWD? Hello,\n\nI am fairly new at Reddit so I apologize if I am doing this wrong. I am 24 years old and was diagnosed with VWD when I was about 6. I had the heavy nose bleeds, bruises out of nowhere, etc. I went to an oncologist regularly but went less and less after I started my menstrual cycle because my doctor believed that the VWD was not as severe. \nI went once again in 2014 because I had one awful nose bleed (rubbed my nose too hard and my nose piercing poked the inside of my nose) but other than that, have not been advised to go back since. I have only taken stimate once ever, and never had any major surgeries. \nNow that my final wisdom tooth is coming in, I had x-rays done at the dentist and its slightly erupted and impacted. Only one little nub of the tooth is erupted, the rest is under the gum. I need to get this thing pulled, but am worried that the bleeding might be too much? Has anyone with VWD had wisdom teeth pulled without any issue? I just called the oncologist to see what they say as well, and to maybe get a new prescription of stimate. The procedure will also be done by an oral surgeon, not sure if that is vital info. Let me know! Go onto the CDC's website for hemophilia and von Willebrand disease (its free and its good).  Look up the closest HTC to you.  Get plugged back into an HTC.  The wisdom tooth may need more than Stimate and getting an adult hematologist for this problem will be handy to have for future pregnancies or other more serious bleeding challenges. thank you. Turns out I cannot get in to see my hematologist until August, and I will definitely need this tooth out before then. If you already have a hematologist, try calling in and asking if you can speak to the nurse regarding the issue. They may be able to resolve it without a visit or talk to you about your options. Type 2B -- got a round of platelets and factor / IV drip of DDAVP prior to extraction. It staved off any severe bleeding. 2 days after when the bleeding picked up again I got a second round, besides dry socket, went off without a hitch.  I was able to squeeze in a visit with a different doc for next Friday- the same day as a big meeting at work :( but I need to get it taken care of. Thank you everyone for your input I believe I am type 1, very mild and have not had any symptoms besides bruising in years. I was told that an oral surgeon/dentist can make the referral for a hematologist, had teeth pulled in the past and didnt need anything for clotting but I am a litte worried about the tooth being under the gum, update: found an oral surgeon local to me that specializes in patients with bleeding disorders, cancer, etc. Excited that I do not have to go to the hematologist (could not get in for ages) and I can finally get this damn tooth out!  Getting plugged into an HTC as an adult is really helpful.  Lots of oncologists are not as well trained in coag (even more so than in peds onc), so having a specialist means you get access to clinical trials and new treatment regimens as well as referrals to oral surgeons, etc that have more experience with bleeding disorders.\n\nThe CDC's website for VWD is really patient friendly and helpful.\n\n\n\nAnother good resource is the private foundation called the Foundation for Women and Girls with Blood Disorders.  \n\nThey do a lot with VWD. Yeah I am not sure, I would make it a priority to talk to a hematologist, even if you have to switch it up. I have gotten my teeth cleaned without treatment once and I cannot convey how awful bleeding profusely from your gums/mouth is let alone from large wounds. \n\nIts also painfully frustrating to get appropriate treatment in the ER if you do not take preventative measures and something goes a miss. Good luck on your procedure! It will be great, just get your ducks in a row! VWD type 2N here.  I factored up huge prior to my procedure and 2 days after.

Thoughts and input appreciated my hemobros and von willie girls!", "After staff and research cuts, Biogen mulls selling its $500M hemophilia assets ", "Heamophilia carrier women dating experience I am a 27 and heamophilia carrier. I have been with my boyfriend for over a year. I disclosed my carrier status pretty early in the relationship. However, very recently we seriously started considering future and kids and my carrier status is causing considerable rifts.\n\nI am uncomfortable of how he reacted to me being a carrier and also about the fact that my ability to have healthy children is affecting his future with me. I am of the opinion that if you love someone, a person's genes should not matter. Of course it will be problematic to have children - but we only need to figure out how to have children - your feeling towards a person should not change. Is this too much of an idealistic view?\n\nCan carrier women\\others share their dating or marriage experiences? How did you know if you are with the right person? It is great that you are having these conversations now. Very responsible. If he cannot accept it and be understanding you may need to think how your future together will be. If you decided to have kids or even stay together. Best of luck. I completely agree with you. If you genuinely love someone and accept someone then that is a very strange reaction. He either has bad information or has some other issues.\n\nWhen I told my wife I had haemophilia she started crying because she was so concerned about my health. I have brought her with me to appointments etc and we now have a beautiful daughter.\n\nPlease do not feel bad. Your view is not idealistic. All valid points.  You also now have the opportunity to \u201cwash\u201d out the possibility of giving birth to a hemo.  I have had 2 carrier friends that chose that option.  Both of their fathers and siblings had bad inhibitors and did not want to pass that on This is a tough situation to be in, and I understand how it can feel a bit hurtful. It is great to have these conversations before getting married.\n\nI have been with my partner for 10 years, and when we met, I was upfront about my condition. My best friend had introduced us and she had given him a quick heads up about my health too, so that was nice.\n\nWhen I have appointments or emergency situations, he comes with me. He has mixed my meds for me, he is come with me to conferences, and he is taken the initiative in research and education. Early on, I was not sure if I wanted kids (same with my partner), personally I love them, but the idea of being pregnant or the ordeal of delivery has put me off for good. If we did want them, my medical care team has protocols in place that include meeting with a geneticist to discuss whether or not I could pass down my severe condition to a child.\n\nThis biggest thing that has helped us deal with my health has been communication. Talk to your boyfriend about what his concerning him. He may have some misconceptions of what raising a child with a bleeding disorder is like. I can tell you right now, that it is far better in 2021 than it was in the 80's.\n\nIt is hard to not take it as a personal affront, but it is a serious thing to consider, and it is good to know if you both stand on the same side. Is this a big compatibility issue for you? Ask yourself if you want to be with someone who may not be supportive of a sick child. Not a female but my opinion is of a male, type A severe.  You say \"I am of the opinion that if you love someone, a person's genes should not matter\" I agree with you 100% but your genes or his may matter very much as to how you handle creating a family.  It is something you should discuss. I will say that I avoided having children (with the agreement of my wife) because I did not want to pass this suffering on to future generations.  We made that decision 20 years ago and now that we are in our mid 40s, I think that was a mistake.  I failed to consider improved medical options and treatments.  I assumed the next generation of hemophiliacs would have a somewhat better life but now I have heard of severe type A teenagers that have very rarely had a bleed and a few that have never experienced a bleed thanks to medical advancements.  I could not have dreamed that possible in the 90s.  And while it is not for everyone, adoption is available.  Not to mention the wizardry CRISPR and gene therapy processes promise in the near future.  It is a tough discussion but you are better off having it now before you two end up married and resenting one another over this.  My parents got married, had me, spent months trying to figure out what was wrong with me, doctors finally identified hemophilia, THEN my mother mentioned she was probably a carrier.  That was too much of a for my father to deal with since she withheld such an important fact from him and the doctors even as I was suffering as a baby.  They divorced within a year and I was raised by a confused, ill prepared single father.  Just try to remember things are always improving and take that into consideration.  And not all people are willing or able to take on such a challenge.  We are all only human after all. I hope things work out for you. Thanks for this. To his credit, he did not outright walk out of the relationship, but the considerable hesitation also made me rather sad.\nIt is good to know however people like your wife also exist - congratulations on a great family :) Thank you for sharing. I agree we are human and I bear no illwill or bitter feelings towards my boyfriend. I understand preferences towards child rearing and wanting children may differ. \nThank you for mentioning about the advanced treatments. That puts things into perspective. I am a dad with severe A. I have of two daughters who are carriers. I have a pretty strong opinion about this. As a kid I went through some tough things. The factor was tainted and I ended up with hiv and hep -c. I had lots of bleeds and suffered quite a bit. Yet still, anyone who questions wether hemophilia is reason to not have kids, to me, is crazy. I mean I get it. But I am sure glad to be alive, and even after all of that, I would not trade my experience of living with hemophilia for living without it. It may have been hard at times, but I am who I am because of it. And what I have endured and learned from it is more valuable to me than anything. As for your fella, it is hard to say- some people just worry a lot about what they do not know. I would give him the benefit of doubt and try not to to take his fears personally. If he wants kids with you he must love you. And being a cautious father is normal. Maybe it is a good quality that he is wanting to be safe and it is probably smart of him to learn about everything and be careful before making such a huge decision. If you live in the US and have access to factor or treatment options, and if you have a history of hemophilia in your family and have someone to talk to about their experience , then that is going to help. If you are completely new to this and have no insurance, etc, then yea, it is a good idea to figure things out first. You do not want to bring a kid with health issues into the world if they are not going to be covered. There is a lot to unpack I guess. But as a gut reaction I always approach it with optimism. Because I went through some of the worst of it and I love my life. Then again I am lucky, 46, single dad, two awesome daughters and I am healthier now than ever. That is an unusual thing to say in my situation. Look at all the info you can. I honestly think having kids period is more of something to take seriously more so than wether they have hemophilia or not. Raising kids is no joke. Get ready! If it is what you really want, then I am sure you will get there one way or another. Give your partner love and understanding and if he is right for you he will come around. If he is not then do not have kids with him! Maybe this is all a blessing in disguise. As all blessings are.  Good luck. I just wanted to say that it is nice to know that I am not the only one with a bleeding disorder that is put off by the idea of pregnancy and giving birth. It honestly terrifies me and I would probably have to quit my job to get pregnant (birth control is the only thing that makes my periods bearable)/be pregnant based on what doctors told me (would be high risk and probably early bed rest months prior to birth). And it does not help that my mom almost died giving birth to me because of her vwd (undiagnosed at the time)...I am an only child because my mom did not want to go through that again. I love children too but I am so tired of repeating the above when asked and having my concerns dismissed because others think it is wrong to be childfree. Hey there. 35/M, severe A here.\n\nStraight to the point, at the end of the day you cannot make someone share a point of view or change their mind. So if ultimately you want biological children and he does not, with the possibility of them being carriers or having hemophilia then you would do well for yourself to go your separate ways. Caring for a child with a disability of any kind is a challenge and he may just not be able to handle it and know it.\n\nI will add though, that his fears and perceptions may not align with reality. So if you have not, I would do what you can to educate him on what life is like for hemophilia patients today, and how far things have come, and where they are going. \n\nI was very hesitant to have kids until I started Hemlibra. It has really changed my life and if I had it as a treatment option as a kid, my whole life would be unrecognizeable from what it has been. Since I have been on it, I have embraced the idea, and my wife and I working on having children together.\n\nAs far as dating in general goes, I have always been upfront about it after someone can get to know me enough to see if they want to keep dating or not. Think 3rd date or so. The hard truth is not everyone is okay with it, and I have had some women discontinue seeing me because of it. And although it hurt at the time, it is okay because it meant we were not right for each other anyway. If your lives and circumstances do not fit, then they just do not.\n\nAlso I will just say that I dated off and on my whole adult life and only found someone I really wanted to marry when I was 33/34. It may feel shitty if you e dated a lot and you are 27 and feeling vulnerable and tired of dating, but I hope it does not. And if it does feel that way (it did to me) then maybe take a break and then try again.\n\nLast thought is that if it would help him to go to some community events or talk to parents of bleeders or patients, then it would be worth looking into if he is willing to do that. I do not know that anyone would bare their soul at an event, but you might make a connection and he may get some frank opinion after the fact. Or even have him come to this subreddit and ask questions. I would be willing to do an AMA and I am sure others would. Thank you for sharing. I think giving him an idea of life with heamophilia is good advice. I will try to get him involved with some community events. Lastly thank you for offering to help. I might reach out. It means a lot. You are welcome! I hope he comes around and if not, then it will hurt but it is not the end of the world. If you want, you can PM me his questions or he can PM me himself and I am happy to answer any questions he might have. I have done way too much research and have heard so many horror stories of \"normal\" births that I just do not see why I would want to do that to myself hahaha\n\nI am made to be an auntie. That is my role, and I kick ass at it. That is great that you are having the discussion but I am sorry he has reacted in this way. \nMaybe he needs a while to let it sink in? \nI a woman with severe von willebrands - knowing you can pass on a disease is a miserable card to hold, you need to make sure your partner is on board for everything. \nAnd they are out there, my friend is also a carrier. She is 7 months pregnant with a boy, they have decided not to test before the baby is born because it does not change the fact they want the baby, her husband is totally supportive of this. \nGood luck, if he is the right guy for you, he will sign up for everything about you!  My Dad is a heamophiliac and I am a symptomatic carrier \\*eye rolls because women cannot have heamophilia apparently \\* (12% factor - which is actually lower than my dad's). I also have a sister who is a regular carrier. We all live very fulfilling lives and the idea that you should not have kids because of haemophilia to me is a crazy one. To each their own, but heamophiliacs can have VERY happy and healthy lives when managed correctly. My mum knew about my Dad's condition before they had kids and it is actually been a really nice bonding experience to have the same condition as my dad, we get to share a life experience with each other and have attended hospital visits together and have grown closer as a result.\n\nI hope your BF comes around and realises that if you guys have kids who end up with haemophilia then yeah some things might be hard, but it is far from the end of the world. Thank you for sharing. Your optimism makes me feel really good. Hope we figure it out \ud83d\ude42 Thanks for sharing this sir! I wish you and your daughters all the best. Male 38 Serve A.\nI have a 5 years old son. This summer number two is on the way. We do not know yet if its boy or a girl. But we are not concerned at all. My wife is a doctor and knows everything about Hemophilia. Today we all live normal lifes. In 5-10 years I am 100% sure that Hemophilia is cured. If I where you I will not be worried. Neither should your boyfriend be. 22 y/o Severe type A male here, from the UK which may be important as getting treatment and medicine seems a lot more straightforward in uk + Europe. \n\nI think you should tell your partner that your kid (and this also mainly applies only for boys) will undoubtedly lead a 99% normal life these days. Ok, s/he is never going to be a football star or boxer if that is what you value, but it is highly unlikely you will ever need to seriously worry about their health.\nThe treatment of haemophilia has come in leaps and bounds in the last 20 (and especially the last 10) years. \nI was born just before prophylactic factor from birth became the medical standard for treating haemos, which did lead to joint damage that I live with and am completely at peace with. \nA kid born in developed countries today will rarely experience serious bleeds or have target joint damage, and with the way things are going I have little doubt they will be eligible for gene therapy by the time they are 18. \n\nBasically, if your partner is questioning having a child with you simply because you are a carrier, they have nothing to worry about.", "Does anyone else have a soft spot for hamsters?

Not all uses are the same. Hamsters? The animal I associated with Factor VIII has always been mice for some reason. Were there contributions from mice in Factor prior to recombinants? Yep, Recombinate is a form of factor VIII\u00a0that is synthesized\u00a0in vitro\u00a0(in the lab) in genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It is structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring human factor VIII. It is\u00a0produced\u00a0by the CHO cells in the culture medium from where it is collected, purified, and formulated as a powder.\n\nAs far as mice go, I am not sure, but I imagine there is been plenty of testing on them. I was still a bit young when recombinant came out, but iirc before then it was plasma from human blood donors. I am pretty sure I read something about Factor VIII and mouse in the little pamphlet that comes with the vials way back when I first got it. That was like 30 odd years ago?

We are not side shows for the world to look at and pity so they feel better about their lives. We are just as capable as anyone else to do anything that they can do. Our bodies may not be 100%, but our minds can be. The mind will only project how you see yourself. If we tell ourselves that we are less than them then we will always be less than. As long as we tell ourselves that we are great and not allow anyone to tell us otherwise, sky is the limit on what we can do. Some may be. They can only trace where mine came from up to my mom and no further. Relatives like uncles, aunts and cousins are fine. I am not following you, but you should never put yourself down or below anyone else. The hemophilia is not as serious as you fear it to be. Death is not as serious as you fear it to be. Life is not as serious as so many take it. Everything is mental, nothing gets into the mind, the mind processes the information the senses give it and project the reality. If you sit and focus on where it came from or how it is going to end then you are going to have a rough life. Pain is neccessary, suffering is a choice. A 15 minute conversation with me would blow the minds of most people because of the places life has taken me and the places this disease takes you mentally.

Hi! I know 2020, 2021 and years to come will not be ideal for immigrations because of COVID-19, but I am trying to investigate as much as I can about this for the time being.\n\nIs there a way for hemophiliacs to immigrate to other countries and have access to healthcare? I know our treatments are often a burden on a countrie's healthcare, and that is why countries like the US and Canada have medical inadmisibility. But I could not find any information on how widespread this practice is, and if it is very widespread, if there is a way to overcome it\n\nFurthermore, do you know if it is possible to live in another country and just ship our prophy from our native country? And, of course, the legality of that practice?\n\nAnd, if that is impossible, is there a country where I can immigrate and get healthcare legally?\n\nFor further context I am from Colombia and I am already a very privileged hemophiliac as I have acces to an appropiate treatment, but I have always liked the idea of moving to another country, so that is why I am researching this anyway. Canada should be fine. They have state healthcare. \nCertainly in most of the EU you would need to have health insurance to cover at least the first 6 months or until you are eligible for the state health care. \n\n\u201cWe may refuse your application if we believe that your health condition might cause an excessive demand on health or social services.\u201d\n\nThe cutoff is $20k per year in medical costs. Yeah. But that applies to most places if you just turn up. \nIf you move with private cover to start with. Then get a job, pay into the state etc, ie get residency then it is ok. \nI looked into this a few years ago. \nIt is not impossible. It is not impossible, but I have heard of people being denied.  I think being young and healthy and able to pay into the system for decades into the future helps. Of course! Plus having a desirable skill set. If they want you then it is definitely easier. Having a sponsored visa from work/university etc. \n\nI moved from the UK to France, even that took about 18months to totally sort out who pays for my care, and I moved with a job. (Thanks Brexit). \n\nIt does add a layer of fun stuff to deal with. But perks of living with a bleeding disorder hey... What kind of skills would you define as desirable skills? At least like, in general. Most countries have lists on immigration information websites. Depends what the country needs.", "Hemophilia in the USA for Immigrants  Hello, I am a 17 year old UK Server Hemophiliac Type A. Currently on once every 3 day Elocta Extended Life rather than traditional every other day medication but I would be more tha happy to switch back to Advate or something if that is what needs to happen. \n\nI have never let my condition stop me doing anything the hospital did not out right ban me from. Despite having less an 0.1&amp;#37; factor in my blood naturally occurring you will find my throwing a mountain bike down a hill with me sat on top, hiking and camping up mountains, I have been a rock climber, a skate park user, I would of done martial arts but I hospital out right banned me and so on.

However I was always told I would never get health insurance over in the States. Now I know people in the state have haemophillia and manage it but I also know they also have the most complex health care system in the world from the seems of it. So how can I get insurance in America if I was a British Citizen with a Green Card. I am moving to the states at one point, I have wanted to for years and just accepted I could not but I am not giving my condition that control.\n\nCan you get insured ? If so what is the cost? Is it only on demand ? Different Laws for Immigrants ? I would want to move somewhere like Tennessee / Kentucky ect, it would almost definitely be a republican state I do not know how much state laws affect this, I know you cannot buy insurance across state lines for some incredibly painful reason. The Affordable Care Act currently prevents insurance companies from refusing coverage due to pre-existing conditions. Even Trump says he wants to keep that part even if he takes down Obamacare, but I suppose we will see. A quick google makes it look like you can still get coverage from the Health Insurance Marketplace even if you are an immigrant. If you are not given the option to purchase health insurance through your employer, you have access to a discounted health insurance plan through the marketplace. There are typically choices between different companies and different plans. Some employers also offer choices, some do not, many offer cheaper health insurance plans than the marketplace. If you are offered health insurance from your employer, you may not get a discounted rate from the marketplace. I am assuming you are not familiar with how US insurance works, you pay a monthly premium just for the insurance, and then when you get sick there is still typically a deductible (a certain amount you must pay before the insurance starts paying) and co-pay(the insured must pay a set price per visit or service) You should look into how these work, but I am betting you will want a higher premium with the lowest deductible and copay as a hemophiliac, as you will need frequent care and doctors visits. I am not actually a hemophiliac or sure what the typical copay is for factor replacement therapies, I just hate insurance companies. If you have trouble paying for replacement therapy, there are sometimes manufacturer\u2019s coupons or other aid services available.\n\nGood luck! I am sorry our health insurance system is such crap!  \n\n Thanks alot for the help guys. I tried looking into this when I was younger and could not find anything and all the people I spoke just said no way. However this seem to be a beacon of hope. Thanks alot.  Hopefully in the many years away I would be looking to move it will all turn out for the better. Hey who knows, I may even get cured with gene therapy in in 10 years.

I actually prefer the US System tbh it just took me the best part of 6 months to get medication for ADHD. Appointments not showing up, huge waiting lists, really quick appointments because they are understaffed and underfunded and once you turn 18 they will not treat you at all if you have not already got a perscription and then your doctor can just refuse it because you are 18 and there is nothing you can do in my area. They just do not treat Adult ADHD, the medications are only licensed for children officially. \n\nMeanwhile literally my entire life fell apart and I could not do anything. I nearly lost everything due to how shit our system is. At least with private insurance you can get seen. People sometimes wait weeks and weeks to see a GP \\(Like a family doctor \\) meanwhile they have a really bad infection that just gets worse. They had to start letting pharmacists prescribe certain drugs because it got so bad. I am all good now and slowly gaining my life back but I lost almost everything due to how shit the NHS is. \n\nOur whole system is just fucked and meanwhile we have trillions of pounds worth of debt and we keep over spending. So if I can afford it I would be glad to be rid of the shitty system tbh.   I am in the US and just waited months to see my hematologist, so do not let the hype fool you.  We have a doctor shortage too.  It is more  expensive AND the care is actually worse over here!  My out of pocket health care expensives are typically in the $20k range annually, and I am not a severe bleeder, so keep that in mind as well.

On the flip side, I can get in to see my hemotologist the same day if I need here in Michigan. She pretty much hunts me down if I do not see her at least once a year. She also has an amazing nursing staff that are incredibly smart and can answer any questions I have. \n\nAs far as insurance, I cannot believe anyone would have 20k out of pocket costs with insurance. You can get a catastrophic plan for around $250/month that has around a 7k deductible. Here in Michigan, we have a state funded program called children's special health care that you can keep if you are an adult with hemophilia and is income based with a max of 5k a year.\n\nI recommend next time you see your hemotologist, asking to talk to a social worker to get better information. Capitalism is great. Manufacturers of our medicine frequently help pay out of pocket maximums, and some even help with the insurance itself. Bayer has a program that also helps cover insurance lapses.\n\nIt is just a small cost of business for them, a few thousand to bring in hundreds of thousands, and good PR too. &gt; I would want to move somewhere like Tennessee / Kentucky ect, it would almost definitely be a republican state I do not know how much state laws affect this\n\nWhy would you want to move to one of the states that have created most hostile environments in the country for healthcare patients? Constitutional Carry / Shall Issue .\n\nI hold many similar values of Republican not that I would ever call myself one even if I lived in America. But I sit firmly on the right side of the political table. Holding Freedom and the Constitution above all principles. I would do anything to give the UK even just the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is truly beautiful.  Thanks so much man but unfortunately these locations are down south and I have no way to reliably get their. I will bring it up to my mum \\(I do not drive yet\\) but I see it as highly unlikely. If Manchester do it \\(My hospital which is still two hours away haha I live pretty far north\\) I will be there in a second. I would trail absolutly anything. Hey man, on that Catastrophic plan for $250 , I am assuming you do not get covered for prophalyxis though ? I literally would be dead without my prophylaxis.\n\nAlso my default to see a hematologist is 6 months unless its an emergency and then you drive 2 hours to be squeezed in between other appointments and shit and it is a total pain. Nurses always take good care though and seem to have plenty of time. They can inject you with factor but not with common sense, it seems. Good luck with that, then! In my experience clinical trials will reimburse for travel expenses, so you should ask about that.  A difference of political opinion does not denote lack of common sense my friend. I have seen the harm caused in my country through lack of arms. London has a higher murder rate than New York city and we have plenty of shooting yet our are all victims. American shooting statistics include justifiable homicide , I.E Self Defense. \n\nI have used a lot of sense, research and time into my beliefs. While admitted I like common sense in regards to why i should not run across roads and nearly get run over which yes it took me 17 years to learn ( Please laugh at this haha). My political opinions do not derive from a lack of common sense merely a different perspective on life to you my friend .  Thanks so much man. 1. Yeah, 17 years old and think that holding a gun makes you a big man, that sounds about right. Boy will you be fucked.\n\n2. We are not friends. Where did I say holding a gun makes you a big man ?\n\nI do not believe that at all. I just believe that the right to defend you and your family is a god given right. Like I said I have been victim too and seen many violent attacks that if firearms where legal could have been peaceful resolved. \n\nIt has nothing to do with being 'a big man' stop making baseless assertions . Sorry, the use of the word friend was me trying to show respect. I am poor at wording things some times and can come across very angry / assertive and wanted you to be aware I was not angry ect.  You have not been a victim of shit.\n\nI suggest that you take advantage of the time that you have to re-evaluate your worldview because if you would label yourself a Republican or Libertarian on such a ridiculous principle you might as well bleed out and let better people get the care you are seeking. I had to be taken to hospital after being assaulted for no reason with my doctors concerned for a possible brain bleed. That is victim of a violent attack. \n\nWhere did I say I would labeled my self anything. I specifically said I would never call my self republican. I am definitely Libertarian but guns are a small part of that. I believe in a free market, the right to do anything that does not harm anyone. I oppose socialism including healthcare and saying you think I should die for these beliefs is just disgusting.  Oh no, you got jumped by some chavs, boo-hoo. I went to the first college in the US that had a school shooting, and a good friend who was there at the time *still deals with it*. Like, majorly. And I have very liberal friends who own guns - for the same reasons you want them - which tells me that if you want to label yourself a conservative, you are probably a shithead.\n\nDo not come on here and try to twist the statistics - guns are a major problem in the US, whereas gun control has succeeded in Australia, Japan and elsewhere. This is the reality.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who use your white privilege to immigrate for the purpose of being able to own an AK47 and get \u201cbetter\u201d health care (you will not, see above), it is not really a stretch to say that you would point it at a minority if you thought you could get away with it, and quite frankly the country (and the rest of the world for that matter) would be a better place without you and your MAGA hat. So many assumption. There was another time where I was nearly killed by being thrown down onto a massive metal grate and I could of died. I was powerless in the situation. This was done because I was English no other reason and I had no defense I was 12 and they where 16. I am not saying I have had it the worst but I am saying bad things happen and where I live now a few years ago a man went round the whole of my county with a shot gun killing everyone. My family whre pulling their kids out of school these things happen here it is just not reported on.\n\nI am not a conservative for like the 10th time. I hold many conservative values stop fucking twisting my words. \n\nAustralia banned guns and violent crime spiked a lot, same as the UK 1997 'Handgun ban'. Huge spikes, you people only look at shootings but all violent crime and murders are bad. I am not twisting anything. (I do not know about Japan so I cannot comment). I do not use /pol/. Stop making assumptions.\n\nI am disgusted. I have tried to show you nothing but respect and because I am different politically you think I would commit murder. You disgusting person. I will always stick up for the rights and freedom of anyone and everyone. Anyone who kills anyone for no valid reason (a valid reason being self defense ) is a truly evil person. I would use that gun to defend anyone about to be attacked and no other reason. A fire arm is a tool to protect the innocent.\n\nI am not an avid Trump supporter, yes I think he is done a lot of great things (TPP, ICE, De regulation, Lower Taxes ect ect) however he is done a lot of disgusting things, Drone strikes ect ect. I do not pledge allegiance to any man, woman or group.\n\nAlso, how do you even know I am white? However yes I am white. How do I have privilege ? Is being followed home every day at 12 for a year because you are White English in Scotland, intimated, hit, having horrible shit said as a kid, no friends nothing literally because of where I am from privileged ? Nearly killed twice because of it ? Gowing home to your bed and crying alone as a little kid because you are hated by everyone and the only reason you get in \"your English\", being told by teachers I need to sound less English if I want to stop getting bullied. \n\nFinancially yes I have had a privileged upbringing because even though my parents came from quiet poor backgrounds (there where times when my nana could barely afford to feed my mum and my dad's parents literally built ships as the working class) my dad worked insanely hard, fighting in more wars than I can count, protecting his country and doing everything to provide for his family. But this does not take away the fact I have had racial bullying, Physical Disabilites, Mental Health issues, ADHD, seen more fucked up shit than I can remember ect ect. I am not bitching all these things made me stronger and everyone has their shit to deal with.  Being bullied, having ADHD ect I would never ever take it away it makes me who I am today but I do not for a second think that this is privileged. Not seeing your dad for 6 months while he gets shot at ? Yeah really privileged that. Stop assuming because of my race I am privillaged. One of my old best mates was born into a fucked up family, schizophrenic mum who raped him, dad lived alone, neither had money, moved into his dads and despite his dad having nothing to do with drugs and no idea became a drug addict to deal with like by 13. Real white privilege here.\n\nYou do not know me, stop taking one political position and assuming so much shit. You are a horrible person and I sincerely hope that you can let go of your bitterness and anger and learn to love all people different opinions or not. I am sorry you are clearly so angry, I wish I could help you. I like how you get mad that I assumed you are just a fucked up privileged white kid when you are actually just a fucked up privileged white kid.\n\nYou do not get to say that you want guns and you are happy with Trump\u2019s ICE and TTP decisions and then claim you are not a conservative. If you are one of his, then you are one of his. The fact that we lost Anthony Bourdain and still have people like you is a crime against humanity. Many factor companies have financial assistance programs. Some will help you pay for health insurance, and almost all of them will help with the post-insurance costs.\n\nPersonally, Baxter pays for my $3,000 out-of-pocket maximum each year, which means all my doctor visits and surgeries for the rest of the year are at no cost to me. In return, Baxter keeps me as a customer and is able to sell their product for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Hemophilia Treatment Centers I have been to always have at least one social worker attached to them for matters like this. Many even 'sell' factor directly to you.\n\nCapitalism works for us. You will want to be prepared to locate a job that will provide you health insurance.\n\nIf you do so you will have no problems.

Some places will not take our blood at all. Some places will take part. IIRC we can donate red blood cells. But our platelets and our plasma are a no go.

It mentions that as well. Hope this helps. Glad that you are even considering donation, far too many people could but do not. Not only can you *not* be a plasma donor, but many blood centers have language that prohibits anyone that you have had sexual relations with from donating. I tried a few times with red cross and they said no. They gave me some snacks and juice though for trying so it was a win. Even if you can, you should not. They have to use large needles when taking donations, and even normal people with sticky blood often get large bruises from them.\n\nOur plasma is the part missing clotting factor, so it is not useful.

That stinks if people do not feel comfortable at HTCs.\n\nOnce correction though, HTCs do not treat male hemophiliacs to get to 100% factor VIII.  A lot of gene therapy recipients only have factor levels around 20% after their treatment. Its not the best, but 20% is pretty solid. Honestly, what the doctor said really is not that far from the truth. You do not need that much factor to create clots. 20% is really good for someone that has hemophilia. Though in surgery or in an accident they should definitely have factor.\n\nAnd as for someone who has less than 1% factor, you never get to 100% after a treatment. Or if you do its for a very short amount of time and normally drops to about 50% if I remember right. Just so you know, it is getting better. Just went to a conference on Women and Girls with Blood Disorders. Yes!!!! That came in editing... But it was originally correct to 100% for major injury or surgery... Editors do not know Hemophilia. Correct re the drop... However, the 20% depends on the person. Mine does not work right and I hemorrhagged greatly.... Needed factor... Sadly, docs rely on factor % too much and need to look more to bleeding phenotype. I know severes who barely bleed and milds who need prophy... The danger is in doctors like this making blanket statements instead of getting to know individual patient realities.. Awesome! Where was it?

Im wondering if any of you have used CBD products to help treat joint pain or pain associated with active bleeds. If you have, was it in like a cream form? CBD pen? Lemme know! TIA I am 27 w bad ankles and I used the oil you drop in your mouth. Noticed a huge difference. I recently started using it again and do not see myself stopping again. The cbd icy hot is also a lifesaver too! Never used CBD, but I can assure you actual herb does wonders. Pain from a bleed is significantly reduced and you become capable of ignoring it. I concur 42 Male severe A - I have tried it but it did not work for me.  After being disappointed with the results I started looking into it more and learned that it is quite possible to get large differences in CBD content.  Not only from one brand to the next, but between batches of the same brand.  So it is possible I got a bottle of low CBD content even though I ordered it from a very popular, celebrated brand at the time.  I would guess it is just my body chemistry though.  Marijuana has not ever done much for me either so my thought is that I am not one of the people that would benefit from CBD.  On the other hand, my half brother swears by medical marijuana and says CBD oil makes a big difference for him.  It is worth trying but look for a reputable brand to hopefully give you consistent relief if it does work for you. Good luck. I know about the real ish, but I work a dangerous job and cannot smoke. If I fail a drug test, I end up in rehab per my employer so CBD is likely my best bet I appreciate it!

Do they make like a topical cream or would you recommend the drops over anything else? I have used a CBD tincture that you eat and felt some improvement in inflammation in my body, all over. If you live in an area where it is legal, I more strongly recommend a topical THC salve.\n\nEdit: coming back to recommend arnica salve or gel. I have natural icy hot type gel and it is great for fresh, hot feeling bleeds in the joints. For muscle bleeds / pain, I am more into tiger balm. Thanks for the feedback! Jeeeez.

The brand I just switched to is Mediterra and I use their 50mg capsules and also their immunity booster tincture that has 20 mg cbd or so per drop with some immune boosting additives.  I would say the two biggest things are regular use and making sure you get a reliable product. Are there prescription CBD oils and creams in countries that have legalized Marijuana? Hey, on top of whatever you are taking to test pain I recommend some sort of cloth wrap if you can. It is really helped me keep things moving smoothly and not accidentally hurting myself more! I find wearing a semi-tight cloth (similar to how socks feel) around a joint helps the movement to stay focused in the direction it is intended and there is less strain and pain overall! Interesting.. I will have to try some elbow socks! I tried it a few years ago but it did not do much for me. After reading through some of the comments, I think I should try again. Thanks OP! Used cream in my ankle for arthritis when I visited Colorado and it worked pretty damn well Is mediterra available online? Sorry it is Medterra and yes you can order from their website I am 23 years old hemophilia severe type A and smoking pure CBD really helps for me. Makes my joints feel more fluid and less puffed up. Really helps with my arthritic pain as well, though it does not last super long it is still great!\n\nThe topical is goood too but I suggest using both topical and smoking/vaping of it. You def can tell the effects with joint pain Have you used the topical stuff to treat pain from an active bleed? Yeah it helps but it is very acute relief Okay, thanks! Be really careful.  A canabinoid researcher gave a talk at a medicolegal dinner and outlined that the pure CBD oils that have no THC in them are less effective and have some unpleasant side effects (that is the chemical that makes skunky pot make you feel bad).  The stuff that works well has some THC in the solution, though not enough to mess you up, but plenty to mess up a drug test.  Go over this with your employer and the medical team for your company. Update\n\nI found a CBD store that opened near me and scoped it out. What I ended up with is dropper for under the tongue administration and a jar of topical cream. I have used it on and off for about a week or so. Im definitely happy with the topical, works great for muscle soreness, bleeds and joint aches. The tincture/dropper is not so much better in my opinion, honestly I prefer the topical. Both work great.

He is had a port since he was 10mosold. He gets factor 3/week. Recently we learned about hemlibra. It sounds amazing! Is anyone here using it? My wife and I would like to hear more about it if you can. Thanks for sharing! Hemlibra has been life changing, in the 11 months I have been on it I have had ZERO bleeds. Once a month I do a shot, and risk management for activities is not always on my mind anymore. Growing up I learned to look at every situation with risk in mind. On recombinant my mind was always on factor levels, last time of infusion, half life, etc. Hemlibra has truly been amazing. I would recommend it purely from a Severe Type A myself, but keep in mind that there are a lot of unknowns surrounding Hemlibra as it is after all a new drug. Severe less than 1% and no bleeds on Hemlibra for 4 months here. \n\nGood point about it being new but I have not noticed any unusual side effects. Severe A, literally 0% factor 8 levels, and from experience I can say hemlibra has been absolutely incredible. I love the subcutaneous injection instead of IV and I have had no problems at all since I started Past hemlibra experience threads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been using it for 2.5 years now - first the clinical trial and for 7 months as a regular user. I have previously written about my experiences in other threads but TL;DR yes absolutely make the switch and happy to answer any questions. Wow, this is great info! Our Dr mentioned the newness of it as well and warned about what we do not know so far. That was a bit unsettling but everything else seems great. We are trying to connect with a family close to use to talk more about it and learn of any side effects. Good to hear that you have had one! My son has 0% factor 8 levels too. He wants to get right of the port (we do too). The subcutanoues injection seems so much easier to manage. Thanks for sharing! Thank you! And, I should have searched first. Oops. There have also been a couple users who have reported lessened effects etc - just remember it will not work the same way with everyone, but around 8 years old is when I got all of the elbow bleeds that resulted in partial loss of moment due to joint damage, so now is very much a good time to make the switch.\n\nThey recently improved the transfer needles used to set up the dose which is very helpful as well.\n\nKnow the calculator, understand what the numbers mean, remember that a bruise that would heal faster with factor will heal slower with hemlibra - but still faster than nothing. Your son\u2019s got to learn to trust his body as well as trust the medicine. Thank you! He is been pretty lucky so far with limited bleeds. I do wonder about the difference in healing time but it is better than nothing. This fall my 4 year old starts it. He has a port as well right now. We spent a good month talking the pros and cons with the drs. His port will be removed after a full year of hemlibra if no break through bleeding has happened. Severe A 0% factor. From all I have read and seen with it, it is a no brainer of a switch with kids. Where do you live? I am in NorCal (recently moved from the East coast)...happy to talk about anything regarding hemophilia or hemophilia related. We are thinking the same thing. My wife actually just spoke with a family today. They said it changed their lives. Good news so far! Thank you! We are in Maine. My cousin started it last fall and he said it is been amazing for him. His target joints have been able to relax and heal some from all the bleeds he had in them. My son is pretty excited about it! Severe A and i also have had a port for around 14 years, been on Hemlibra since November and have had 0 bleeds and really no problems with it at all, i have had a couple of nasty falls which previously would have resulted in 2-3 weeks of recovery but now was just 1 night of ice packs and then back to normal. Subcut injections are amazing and so easy aswell, such a time saver. Currently in the process of trying to get my port removed as soon as possible. Awesome, thank you for sharing and GL! I have been on it for 8 months and it is a life changer for sure. There has been the mention of arthralgia (joint pain) as a side affect for some. I experienced this pretty seriously after 3 mo the or so, and was considering stopping Hemlibra and going back to regular factor because it was so painful and other problems were arising (tendonitis, worry about joint damage). So I recently started taking half a dose every week, instead of once every 2 weeks, and the arthralgia is manageable now. Take this for what it is, it is not a warning at all, more of an experience that could have many causes. But as difficult as it was to understand what was happening, it did happen, and I do feel better now on weekly doses. I feel like it may be that my body reacted to the volume of the medicine (because of the mechanism in which it works, as an immune response) and when I use less, even though more frequently, I do not have an immune response. So far so good. It is good with any new medicine to be cautious. I hope there are no problems with Hemlibra because it is absolutely changing hemophilia. Learn as much as you can about the science and how it works so if these kinds of things occur you are able to make educated guesses on how to proceed. I could write more, because there is more to consider. Last year i got hospitalized with an inhibitor. Laying there for a whole month bleeding from my left kidney. Pumped up with novo-7 and other medicaments i cannot remember the name of, the bleeding stopped. I spent another week in hospital only to be let go a day before my 18th birthday.  \nGiven that i still had the inhibitor, i was forced to take Hemlibra. If not for Hemlibra, i would have been hospitalized for longer, as they could not risk me starting to spontaniously bleed. Wow, are you still using Hemlibra? Thank you so much! This is super helpful. We have not heard of the potential joint pain. I have achy joints now (non-hemophilia). So I wonder if my son will be predisposed to whatever I have. Thank you! no, but it took nearly a year for the inhibitor to go away. As soon as my factor 8 started to appear \"normal\" again, i stopped. Ahh Ok, I see. Do you mind sharing why you went back to prophy? Prophy? wym? If you mean regular factor 8 injected right into the blood-stream, i did not. I have type A Moderate, and have not needed to take it regularly.  \nAlso. Something bizzare happend while i was in hospital. Some day the doctors thought the regular stuff might work.  5 minutes after injection i started to get allergic reactions. I have not used factor 8 since, and are now using Novo-7 in emergency cases. Ok, I see. Good for you! Thansk for sharing your experience. We really appreciate it! Hope you get the help you need. Severe A and I have been using hemlibra for 8 months.  Have not had any bleeds yet.  It has been absolutely amazing so far. Thank you and good luck! Severe, &lt;1%. Been on it for about three months. No major bleeds.

In my experience in the US, clinical trials usually help to defray travel costs for study participants.\n\nThere is also an ( that lists clinical trials. I have seen the website, but most of the studies in europe/us are exclusive for their citizen, there are almost no infrastructure/research for hemophilia in my country. I have also tried to contact shire/baxalta for their free factor program, but they wont accept applications from persons living outside usa.

I would start by calling the contacts listed under all of the open trials, recruiting or not (about a dozen listed on the website) at the hospitals closest to you, and ask them for advice.

Comments? Any advice would be great.", "Curious about US Hemophiliacs' stories about the ACA and thoughts about the future Moderate hemophiliac here! The Affordable Care Act was very helpful for me in that it allowed my factor to be insured as self-employed, independent contractor. The premiums were more expensive than I would have liked sure, but it was still way better than having to pay out of pocket. Curious about other bleeders experiences with it (negative or positive). Thanks! I think one of the big positives was doing away with caps to benefits though I have heard some places found loopholes in that. I have always had stable private insurance and no cap before the ACA, but the issue with caps was always concerning if I switched jobs. Pre-existing condition and lifetime caps were the big ones for me.\n\nI left my job at a big company to try my own thing in large part because the ACA made me feel more comfortable. I paid for COBRA through my former employer, but it was reassuring that if I needed to go past 18 months, I could.\n\nI am in a similar situation now, where I would like to leave my big company to start my own business again, but I have not taken any steps in that direction because of the uncertainty around pre-existing conditions. Severes, on average, tend to get infusions usually twice or three times per week. That is about 150 infusions, and at roughly 2,000 units, that is around 300,000 units per year. Factor costs approximately $1/unit. So those plans that had lifetime caps of $1 million or $5 million were good for (respectively) about 3-15 years at most - and that is just for the factor, assuming nothing else goes wrong and no other expenses are needed. Just one hospital stay could accelerate how quickly we blew through such caps. Thanks to the ACA, they are gone now, and it is quite the relief.\n\nWhen moving to NY for Grad School I nearly fell into an insurance void because (ironically) I was *able* to get insurance. My COBRA benefits were running out just as I was moving to NY, so I needed a new plan. I could get insurance through my school, but it did not cover factor medication. On the other hand, there was a NY State high-risk pool - but you could only apply to that if you could prove you were uninsurable otherwise, and since I had access to the graduate student insurance, that was not the case. I had to jump through a ridiculous number of hoops to get into the high-risk pool, and even then, the monthly premiums ended up being about $200 more than my monthly stipend. Thanks to the ACA, now I would be guaranteed to be able to find a plan that could work - and due to the Medicaid expansion, grad students often qualify Medicaid or significant subsidies. For the past four years, my premiums have been roughly $100/month or less.\n\nI work with hemophilia advocacy at the state level here, and it is truly ridiculous the number of insurance problems faced by hemophiliacs with inhibitors. Most treatments for inhibitors involve some version of just flooding the body with more factor, either to overwhelm the inhibitor or to just get around it, and those patients can easily use millions of dollars of factor in a year. Getting companies to cover them used to be a nightmare; now it is relatively routine.\n\nIt sucks, hard-core, that the average person has seen a spike in premiums. But it is also to be expected - the ACA forced insurers to take on the very customers they would dropped as being too expensive, and those who are supposed to share that burden (healthy, low-cost individuals) often found it easier to pay the small fine rather than buy into the system. For those of us with severe pre-existing conditions like Hemophilia, though, this bill has been an incredibly positive change. Thanks for your reply! The issue with caps was major Thanks for your response. I really wanted to hear from Severes since my yearly factor needs as a Moderate comes to a (relatively) minor $25000-$50000 for factor per year. That is awesome to hear how low your Premiums are, my premiums are about $300/month in Oregon. While expensive, still a million times better than being uninsured. How do you recommend getting involved with hemophilia advocacy? Absolutely, the ACA made it possible for me to go out and start my own business without the fear of a medical emergency throwing me into bankruptcy. The uncertainty right now is definitely killer, because if this goes away, I will have to close my LLC and go find a big company to work for.  Why is the cost of factor units constantly high? Some types of procedures drop in price and increase in quality (correcting vision with lasers, plastic surgeries etc.), and factor remains expensive with little science progress in the last couple of decades.  First check on your local and national hemophilia organizations. There are two national groups to look into: ( (NHF) and the ( (HFA). Each group handles organization and information at the national level and each is made up of local chapters across the country. For instance, your local Oregon chapter of the NHF is ( These groups are always looking for more volunteers, whether it is just for one event or for all of them. Get in touch with your local chapter, see what advocacy events they hold in your state. Also see if they participate in Washington Days, an annual advocacy event put on by the NHF and held in Washington D.C. Hemophiliacs or members in the community always have personal, relevant stories to share with lawmakers, and it is incredibly powerful to meet with them and their staff and get to talk about an issue that truly impacts your life.\n\nStart local, and see if your chapter has any advocacy events coming up. And if not, offer to help start one! There are a ton of resources out there through the national organizations. Even in blue states like NY or Oregon there are always issues at hand that directly affect our community. So true, wish I knew the reason Awesome. Thank you. There is a capsule being developed for Hemophilia B that is supposed to end up being significantly cheaper, hopefully to reasonable levels. Have not heard anything about Hemophilia A though, but progress is at least being made.\n\n", "Do other carriers have guilt feelings about passing Hemophilia on ??? I do not deal with my feelings well. \nI know I did not do it on purpose &amp; had no control over passing Hemophilia on. \nBut the fact is, I gave it to my son. \n Remember the \"prayer of serenity\"? Most of us have heard of it even if we are not \"religious\". In sum it asks for the wisdom to know how to separate the things we can control from what we cannot.  Hemophilia is a genetic condition, with little environmental influence i.e. spontaneous mutations. That means it passes without permission. You did not ask to be a carrier or pass it along it just happened. There are things in life that \"just happen\" no permissions, preparation, or policies. They just are.  I know that does not all the way answer your question but I am encouraging you to forgive yourself for whatever guilt you carry with this, you are not alone.  But you have to see your child as more than a diagnosis.  We are so much further along towards living \"normal\" lives and kids with hemophilia are living just as long and doing just as many things as those who are not affected. There are lots of resources for the emotional and medical pieces. Look up it is getting brighter for the community! I am almost 40...   I hold no hard feelings towards my mother.

She probably felt just like you did.   Treat him like a normal kid, because he is.   He is going to need to be a little more careful in life, in general, and not take part in high impact sports.  And that is fine.  I did not have the easy at home meds that are available now, and I still rode bikes (without helmets), built tree forts, and played basketball in my driveway.   If ever there were a time to be a hemophiliac, now would be that time...  I cannot fathom how much easier my life would have been, if instead of going to the hospital (till I was 15) every time I was injured to get bags of plasma, I could just get a 10ml shot at home.   \n\nGet 27 gauge needles and encourage him to learn to self infuse.  \n\nYou will do just fine.

Believe it or not, left handed people have shorter life expectancies because we get into more trauma.  My mother did not willingly make me lefthanded no more than you made your son a hemophiliac.\n\nMy mother knew that being left handed was a pain in the rear.  She made sure that I learned how to write and do things left handed.  This helped me.  You need to work with your son's treatment team to help him.  In doing that, you will be stronger and feel less guilt.\n\nBe strong for your son and teach him to be independent.  Do not be a binder mom.  When I ask my patient about his last bleed, I want him to answer, not his mom.  These kind of boys go from binder moms to binder girlfriends to binder wives.  No bueno.  \n\nMake sure he knows how to self infuse and watch himself.  Grow him up to be strong and independent.  Watch him graduate from high school with a letter in sports.  Watch him go to college and get that good degree.  His strength will feed you with pride.

I have some questions I am hoping someone can shed some light on. \n\nWe know the fibrinogen level of my husband but not our daughter because she is on BCP which raises factor levels. It would be potentially dangerous to take her off just for testing. My question is, assuming she has the same mutation as her father, would her fibrinogen level be the same as her father or could this vary?\n\nAlso, we know her brother also has a 50% chance of also having this bleeding disorder and are discussing whether he should be tested (future insurability can be affected). His father did not show any life-threatening symptoms until he had some surgery but severe trauma can also be an issue. Would people recommend he be tested in spite of the insurance issue? (I am in Canada so medical coverage is not the issue.)\n\nFinally, we do not think either of my husband's parents had a bleeding issue (both have had multiple surgeries) so does that mean the FGB gene just randomly mutated on my husband or could it have jumped somewhere in his family history?\n\nThanks for any insight.

Just wondering that if i can workout for example sprints up a hill and that is pretty much the big thing. Theres orher stuff but its small. Just wondering if i can do that in a day i dont got medecine. Ty Depends on a lot of things. Do you have target joints? What is your baseline factor level? When was your last dose? Yada yada. You have got three options as I see it: skip it for that day, factor up before/after, or do it and see how it goes. When I was younger I would just go for it and infuse later if I needed to, but I have got arthritis in both ankles and both elbows now (at 32), so take from that what you will. You know your body best and have a better idea what it will do than anyone on reddit does. Listen to your body and do not ignore the little signs of a bleed. I agree with u/machine_elf710. Your use of \"a day without factor\" makes me think that you are not on a long-lasting product. If you are regularly working out and you do not have any existing issues, target joints etc, then you are probably fine to work out as much as usual even if your factor level is low. However I would not push yourself to workout harder than normal. I dont have any joint bleeds but ya i might just do it at night so i can also workout tomorrow morning and get 2 in 1 Ty. Also do the long lasting products work for exercising lifestyle? Absolutely, though I would recommend getting pk testing done through your HTC to see what your factor levels are after 'x' amount of days. To reiterate, if you are going to push yourself past what you would normally do, I would do it on a day closer to your infusion. \n\nHemlibra should also prevent the mass majority of Hemophilia related workout injuries if you have considered switching to that. Though if you are doing something like skiing or skateboarding where you have the potential for a traumatic injury you will still need clotting factor on hand. So correct me if I am wrong if you are on factor and not any long lasting medicine like hemlibra then I would not recommend it unless you are and missing 1 dose which is fine and it also depends on how your bleeds get weather your mild, moderate, and severe and it depends on how much your doing this if your just starting this out restrict yourself to at least 1 hour of walking you can speed walk but I would not recommend any sprinting depending on how your joints are again it all depends on what is your medicine routine with your hemophilia and how you treat it I wrestle and infuse everyother day.

Also from what i know, i have no enhibitor Yeah and it is been great have not had any bleed in the past 5 years I did have a really bad knee bleed while on the study at first and it healed within two months and yes there is there is official website that has a guide for hemophiliacs who wish to be on it and ah okay but either way it is still good to use and very simple ranging from either 1 or 2 injections based on your doseage and it is only subcue once week for me at least and so far have had no problems since then  Man that sounds like your living the dream rn bro. ty for the information Yeah no problem man and I would not say the dream you do have to do your best to be consistent with the medication but overall it does have its benefits but still be as careful ya know Well i assume its better then taking factor Vlll for 17 years every 2 days and missing constantly Hey dude all I can say as a 19 year old with type A severe with an inhibitor is do not be hard on yourself I have missed my fair share of fun days I could have had and shit ton of school but I did what I could to get as far as I did but believe me there are others like you and me out there so know that your not alone and yeah the idea of having to use factor to prevent bleeds does absolutely suck but from my perspective man you cool cause I have never heard of a hemophiliac a with severe and on prophylaxis: (consistent infusion of factor to prevent bleeds)  do wrestling or hard-core workouts I mean I workout now thanks to hemlibra but I still do what little I can to help keep myself fit for my joints and overall well being but there are other great things about being a hemophiliac too there are events and gatherings online where you can meet and see other people and even ones that take place at a venue idk if you ha e been to the hemophiliac summits in the past but those are fun and a great learning experience every time I go there is always something new but again I can understand the struggle of having to take constant factor whether through a portacathe or iv I just had mine removed earlier this year due to me not needing it thanks to hemlibra and I had the port for 16 years and it was still working for that long its in a jar now I keep as I reminder to myself and where I began \ud83d\ude04 Man. Ty for sharing your experience Step one is always to contact your hematologist. Are you on consistent prophylaxis? What medication do you take and what severity do you have? All questions you need to ask.\n\nAs a hemophiliac with severe A who is on prophylaxis, I can consistently workout by doing sprints, weights, whatever. So far all good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoin the community! HemoTalk.tk Type A severe here. I have to treat every 48 hours to keep my levels about 3-5%  Does your inhibitor effect hemlibra? I have tried like 3 different products over the past 31 years and am always weary to switch and end up developing an inhibitor. They say i5s not caused by switching products but at the same time cannot guarantee it will not happen. What do you take ? Well the thing is you would have talk to your hematologist and get there input too I was on novoseven for a good 13 years and when I switched to hemlibra on the haven 1 study I got microdoses of of it to treat a current bleed I was having at the time but after the first two months I stopped and was mainly on hemlibra since then and no my inhibitor has not really have had any problems with hemlibra and that is one thing too that for those who do have active inhibitors this medicine can really do a lot like earlier this year I went into surgery for a ankle synavectomy and port removal and was taking low doses of factor to prevent a bleed even though I am on hemlibra it is not a instant cure but it does do enough to prevent bleeds but that possibility of you getting a bleed is still there cause for me I have target joints so I am still careful The one that is everyother day that gets your levels high Hemlibra? If it is that, dude I have been doing gym, capoeira and bjj and have Nothing hemophilic related.\n\nGym 4x a week - \nCapoeira 1x a week -\nBJJ 4x a week - No the one that last 24 hours. Helimbra last like weeks Thinking on getting on it though. Dam nice routine u got. Bro if you can get on it, I have been on almost a year did not had a Single bleed yet, and I have build up to this rhythm, still getting on with the bjj but loving it Man. Hows the injection part of it. Is it hard stressfull or painfull. Or just easy? About this try to do like, if you take the factor 3x a week, do your heavy sessions in these days and the other days work on mobility/Flexibility a must for us to keep good joint function, search about CONTROLLED ARTICULAR ROTATIONS, awesome. Easiest thing in the world to prepare and to infuse goes in the upper quad, have not fell nothing, the needle you do not even feel it compared to standard treatment. Fucking hell dude. Your making me jelous and excited if and when i get the chance to get on that. Is there and downside at all? Pls tell me I mean there is people it does not work so well, but for me I have not felt anything, I infuse and that is it, have not felt nothing and I infuse every 2 weeks. What happens to the people it doesnt work so well on? It just does not elevate you % of factor and you have to go back to normal treatment I have not heard of bad side effects, but do not take my word for it do a little research you should find it easy Man i hope it works for me. It seems like a dream. Hope it does too and it changes your life as it has changed mine.\n\nCheers", "My Employer Will No Longer Cover Factor My NJ employer told me that after a year of working there, they received an annual report from the insurance company. I came up as a red flag as my factor expenses was 172,000 a month. They said I cost the company 2.1 million dollars and as a result they made a \"business decision\" to remove my factor off the list of drugs they are willing to cover. They said if they kept me on the plan that everyones rates in the company would go up. \n\nI am at a loss right now as I am 25 and this is my first job. It is a large company too so I did not think I would come across this issue. So now I am looking at options for health coverage and job searching..  Some things to try, in case you have not already:\n\n* Contact your product manufacturer to see what their Patient Assistance Program can do for you.  They may be able to cover you if you have a coverage gap.\n\n* Contact your HTC.\n\n* Contact your local chapter of the NHF.\n\n* Contact an employment attorney. Also check out (  which leads to (  This is why you probably need an attorney. Thank you for the advice! I have already contacted my HTC, Social Worker and local chapter who are negotiating with my employer on rates of factor. If this proves unsuccessful, I would have to enroll in ACA and would ask them if they can help cover my premium at least. If that does not work, I am going to try the patient assistance program but this would only be a temporary solution which will buy me time to find other work. \n\nI am in contact with an attorney but waiting to introduce them in the conversation with my employer because I do not want to cause a rift just yet. If they are willing to help me find a solution, hopefully I do not have to pursue a legal option.  Seems clearly illegal to me.  Does the attorney think you have a case? How much units do you use per month?  That is a really huge price. I am in EU, my costs are around 18 000$ per month (20k units). because i have an inhibitor, i do daily 4,260 units which is 127,800 units a month I should rephrase that, I am trying to contact a few lawyers but it is difficult to find one who has an expertise in the healthcare laws and for the state of NJ, trying to leverage a resource I can find within the community The New Jersey Bar Association may be able to help with a referral too. \n\nI know condolences do not help but I am really sorry you are going through this. Something like this has been a fear of mine my entire adult life. Based on how my father's insurance changed while I was on his plan, maybe it already happened to me and my parents just never told me. Thank you so much for the reply! I will definitely use that link to try to get some assistance and I genuinely appreciate the condolences, it may not help with the financial assistance but it truly does help me deal with this situation mentally. it is warming to hear that I have support, it has been a hard life and its people like you that keep me going.  Healthcare law may be too specific.  Employment law may be what you need:\n\n( I think HFA has resources, too. Http://hemophiliafed.org there is only about 20,000 of us in the US...  When will the drug companies be held accountable?   They have already made their money back in spades from us.   To make us feel like a burden, in this manner is unconscionable.    \n\nTo do some simple math on this...   This is assuming a bit, but let us say this is to find the \"mean\" dosage in the life of a hemophiliac over the last 20 years.\n\n - 3 doses a week\n - 52 weeks in a year\n - 20 years for the average? patient who has been on a recombinate\n - 20,000 hemophiliacs...\n - ~$2000/dose\n\n$ 124,800,000,000\n\nI am not sure if this is outrageous or conservative math, but I tried to keep it down the middle.   124 billion dollars...   \n\nLet us round that down to 100 billion dollars.    How...   Who is making all of this money off us?   Where is it going?    My son is at 1000 units 3x a week. His cost is about $17,000 per month US. I think it comes out to about $1.50 per unit.  This sounds illegal Seton Hall law school has a well thought of health law program.\n\nI would consider contacting them for their expertise. \n\n Sorry for chiming in so late, but if you have not already, please contact the ( (also known by the unfortunate acronym HAN-J).  They are an independent chapter (affiliated with HFA, not affiliated with NHF) and one of the oldest chapters in the country.  They exist to deal with situations like yours and they are particularly good at it.  Worst case scenario, they have a financial assistance program that will purchase a BC/BS insurance policy for you, income dependent.\n\nTheir email/phone is on the contact page of the website, but feel free to PM me if you want a specific contact person. I have an inhibitor so I have to do daily infusions Thank you! I will be giving them a call today I not saying your prices were wrong. I was simply giving an example of someone without an inhibitor.  Thank you! I have reached out to HANJ and am working with Stephanie. I think I will more than likely have to sign up for a marketplace plan through the ACA and asking the company to provide me with a salary increase that would cover my premium.  Oh no worries, I did not mean it that way. It is always good to share advice, thank you! \u263a\ufe0f So since your employer is self-insured does that mean that they are not subject to the state laws governing group insurance which mandates coverage for hemophilia?  Does it also exempt them from the state's law against employment discrimination?\n\nI wonder if they are also kicking their employees with cancer to the curb? Jeebus! That is insane. My son is 5 and taking ~$20k in factor per month and I thought that was scary. I am worried for his future when he cannot get Medicaid, which completely covers all of his hemophilia costs. And if he develops an inhibitor like you have that will be even more terrifying. \n\nI read your update... Here is hoping you get this figured out! &gt; there is only about 20,000 of us in the US... \nThat is *it*?? That is so incredibly rare. I had no idea it was so uncommon. I do not have hemophilia, but my ex wife is a carrier, and my 5 year old son has severe hemophilia A. \n\nWhat is even more mind blowing is that with so few people with hemophilia, the fact that he also has autism seems impossible. (And I am aware of at least two other people alive in the U.S. who also have hemophilia and autism, which is so unlikely that I cannot even comprehend those numbers.) Makes ya wonder about things, does not it?    We do not know why autism is on the rise, but 20 years from now, when 10% of the adult male 30-60 year old population is on the spectrum, we might look back and slap ourselves.  \n\nBest of luck with your boy.   I made it, and we did not have fancy medications until I was about 15.   My father also was not too great, but my mother did make up for that, in some ways.   Do not treat him like a bubble boy.    The majority of his injuries are going to be knees and ankles.  Treat those ASAP to avoid him having arthritis by the time he is 30. We do know why autism is on the rise, and it is not because more people have it. We are just getting better at diagnosing it, and the requirements are getting broader. For example, Asperger's used to be separate from autism, but it is fairly recently been classified as a part of the Autism spectrum disorder. \n\nThe media likes to play it up like more people have autism, which is not really true -- more people now *know* they have autism.  And thank you for the advice! His mother and I definitely do not treat him like a bubble boy -- in fact we might be a little *too* free range with him. He likes to be physically active, and we have never tried to slow him down. Other parents are aghast at my carefree parenting style, letting him play on the playground without a worry about him hurting himself. He is strong, agile, and has amazing coordination. \n\nWhat do you mean about treating knee and ankle injuries right away, though? Like giving him extra factor when he complains they hurt? Icing them? What sort of injuries should I be on the lookout for? I guess try to teach him about how the knee works - maybe with a skeleton model... \n\nAnd then explain how blood will leak into there, and will make it feel stiff, and to let you know so you can get him his medicine... make a fun name for it or something.    I am sure you already use the 27 gauge butterflies, but if not, switch asap.     I do not think extra factor is needed...   My parents do not remember much about my childhood...   my dad apparently remembers when I bashed my head really bad...    Guess it stopped bleeding eventually! I am apt to agree with you, but at the same time, got to keep an open mind to some environmental thing being a catalyst. ", "Hemlibra administration for 7 days  Hi, I read about Hemlibra. A revolutionary cure for us with Hemophilia. The half-life of Hemlibra is 28 days. If that is true, why give it for 7 days? Unfortunately, here in Serbia, older hemophiliacs are not given Hemlibra. Roche which is manufactur of hemlibra, recommends weekly dose, but it depends on your doctor and your response of your body. I am now taking dose per every three weeks. But before that for two years I was taking it weekly, once our body adjusts to the drug, we can extend the dose by doctors recommendation Okay, thanks for the reply. I understand. Excellently explained. Thank you. If it is true that the half-life of Hemlibra is 28 days, what happens if it is given for a week? Is there an excessive accumulation in the patient's blood? No, Roche recommends weekly dose. I took week dose for 2 years once my body is adjusted, doctor recommended to take every 3 weeks Since your doctor prescribed a dose for three weeks, did you have any symptoms? What was the cause of the dose change? No other symptoms, the main cause dose change is availablity and cost and doctor did not change directly to three weeks, we took it gradually like 1.5 weeks, 2 weeks like that. And I had no bleed in this period so doctor told me that it will be good for three weeks. And since going on three weeks no bleeds, just my ankle osthio arthritis pain nothing else. Yes, I think I understand. Roche has an interest in selling Hemlibra as much as possible, and the state is trying to save money. The doctor is a civil servant. He will be on the side from which he lives. If all the factors of society adhered to scientific facts, that would be ideal. Right on point", "Can we have fish oil?

By the end of the day, my neck would be all black because of the metal. When I was little we would buy cloth watch bands from the sports store and stitch my medic alert tag onto it. I wear stainless steel dog tags now, but you could also look at putting a coating over the metal. People often paint the inside of rings with clear nail polish, there may be a similar solution that works for you. Yea, I am wondering if just going with a stainless necklace would help. I figured it would happen with any metal. Kind of like if I end up spending the day welding, my hands are blackened from handling all the metal.  If you have your meditag around your ankle, will medics know to check there in an accident? The tags have the symbol and the ankle bracelets have been oriented to EMS and sold by Medicalert online for at least 5 years, so I would think so.", "Coagulation Factor VIIa (Recominant) jncw Dosing Question Hello. I am trying to figure out the dosing formula for a Coagulation Factor IIVa (recombinant)-jncw medication. The documentation says the starting dose is 225\u00b5g/kg. The vials of medication come in 1mg and 5mg bottles. How do I calculate how many vials I will need? There must be a formula I can use. I thought it would be (.225) x (my weight in kg) would give me the number of vials I would need but it seems like WAY too much. i.e., .225 x 80kg = 18mg. That would be three vials of 5mg and 3 vials of 1 mg. six vials seems like way too much. What am I doing wrong? Your math as presented is correct. In my experience it is not unusual to get multiple vials for a dose since it is all expensive enough that insurance/pharm companies will go that far with the vial denominations to accommodate all ages to some degree - your 1 mg vial and dosage would be about right for a newborn term baby on the bigger side, for example. So my math works out to the same as yours.  It looks like they offer vials in 1, 3, 5, and 8mg.  Your Hematologist or HTC should work out the math and order your dosage in the most convenient (fewest vials) possible based on availability.  You should not be having to figure out the details of your dosing on your own.

Do you/can you take iron supplements regularly? \n\nAlso without knowing more about your condition it is a bit difficult to say what could help other than go easy on yourself. I do take iron daily thought it is tearing up my stomach causing pain and nausea. \n\nAnd I have got Vonwillebrand Disease. If you make sure you take the iron with food it is better... I know it is miserable though. I spent most of my childhood on iron supplements. \n\nI have severe VWD, so it sounds weird to me that you are still having bleeds. Are you sure they have your type correct? I do not respond to DDAVP at all so have never had it as treatment, right now I am on factor prophylaxis as was having so many nose bleeds. But it is been a while since I have had low iron levels. They stabilised when I got to adulthood/controlled my periods so it is really only when I have had major bleeds.\n\nAre you treated by an HTC, it really sounds like you need your bleeding looked into more? And do they talk to you gastro team - they should also be to help adjust your tube feed to help with iron and fluid levels? I sadly cannot really eat much so I try and eat something small but it does not help much. Maybe because I already start out nauseated. I also do not think it is absorbing. Its been months and my iron levels have only came up from 37 to 40. They would have ran it IV at 36. I guess my insurance would not pay until then. \n\nAnd as far as I know yes we have the right type. For me the VW factor activity is on the low end of okay but my ristocetin and antigen that are both half of what they should be. And then my fibrinogen is high. The DDAVP seemed to help for a bit but recently not so much. I want to asking them about running a collagen binding assay as my primary genetic issues affects all of my collagen so maybe something from that is not allowing the DDAVP to work. \n\nI have been referred to a HTC center. I am just waiting on a call back from them. My GI and cardiac doctors are all aware of the issue and if needed will send extra fluid out to my house. The iron is suppose to be in my formula but it is apparently not enough Hmmm it really sounds like you are doing everything you can for the moment. Which I know is frustrating. I think until you can get the bleeding under control it is going to be a bit rough going. :(\nWith the iron - have you tried liquids? But it is just something that is not kind on your stomach, is not great for being absorbed and the iv stuff is expensive. I would definitely push for been seen at an HTC as soon as possible as I think that is probably the best next step. \nSorry not to be more help, I think you have to remember to look after yourself and that this is a glitch that gets sorted soon.", "B More Scholarship - open to anyone with a diagnosis of Hemophilia B Hello fellow bleeders \ud83d\ude1c.

This little kid is in India and although medical facilities are pretty good out there, his parents are of the opinion that they might have better chance in US. Someone has apparently told them that we have a treatment available here in the States. So I am here trying to gather as much information as I can for the family.\n\nI have been reading quite a bit about it and have a general idea, but I would still like to make sure I have the right understanding.

Our dad traveled for work from 1982 - 1992. 2 of 4 siblings were born overseas. My bro was born in 1992. I have seen so much advancements between my age and my brothers age. Our nephew (2 years old) also has hemophilia with Inhibitor. We cannot tell if he has hemophilia. We have attended lots of conferences and we cannot tell if other younger kids have Hemophilia. Severe haemophilia ? Not diagnosed until 12 months old. That fascinates me.    What advancements have you seen? \nBetter / safer treatment product? \nThat is about it. \nTreatment for haemophilia has not changed in 20 years. ProphAlatic treatment 3x week. Nothing has changed.

Unfortunately...", "Gene therapy update - Week #4 My factor 8 levels were at 50% this week a slight plateau on the previous increases. Turns out my liver was going into a panick and my enzyme levels spiked all the way up to 68. I was put on a 3 day course of IV steroids to help the factor expression and a higher dose of immune suppressers so my immune system will chill the F out. \n\nMy levels yesterday were Factor 68% and ALT 67\n\nThe ALT level is still quite high but that test was after just one increased dose of Immune suppressers. So hopefully by Monday it should be down.\n\nIn terms of side effects from the increased my meds my skin is oily as hell, my heart is pumping pretty hard, I get intermittent shakes and tremors but the steroids are giving me a real energy boost. So despite looking like an oily speed freak I am being fairly productive. Every healthy percentage increase is good for us no? Or does having too much factor levels cause problems like inihibitor?\n\nIam sorry if this sounds pessimistic but how long have the docs or researchers projected the gene therapy to produce factor VIII in patients body, 10 years, 20 years, 30+? Do you have any insight on this? The clotting factor is expected to fluctuate in the first year before it levels out at a more consistent level. Some patients have gone up to 200% at their peak which causes an increased risk of clotting however this normally falls to a lower, more normal level.  I think managing high levels of clotting factor is a bit less invasive than managing low clotting factor.\n\nThe professor treating me is optimistic that my levels will stay above 20% for the rest of my life. That is based on the effectiveness of this specific vector (the virus that delivers the gene) and also the concentration of gene therapy I have received. \n\nThere is a lot of variables and unknowns that they are trying to understand. Some Haemo B patients hit the 60% mark and fell back down to 3%. That is still a huge burden lifted from your life.\n\nNow that I have been treated with this vector I will not be able to have it again. If they figure out in a few years time this is the perfect vector for delivering the genes it will no longer work with me as I have already been exposed to it. \n\nBest case scenario I will stay above 50% for the rest of my life but even If I can get 5 or more years of being above 3% And not worrying about prophylaxis and breakout bleeds while my son grows up I will be happy.

That is still a huge burden lifted from your life.\n\nNow that I have been treated with this vector I will not be able to have it again. If they figure out in a few years time this is the perfect vector for delivering the genes it will no longer work with me as I have already been exposed to it. \n\nBest case scenario I will stay above 50% for the rest of my life but even If I can get 5 or more years of being above 3% And not worrying about prophylaxis and breakout bleeds while my son grows up I will be happy. Absolutely hope you stay above 50% level, but frankly speaking even being on around 5%-10% would be absolutely game changing for us who came from &lt;1% no? Thanks for giving the complete answer. Have a fantastic weekend sir. My understanding is that researchers consider 12% activity to be the level required to prevent spontaneous bleeds.  While it is not anywhere near the \"normal\" lab level range, you are still going to be protected except for cases of major trauma or surgery. The Haemo B study you mentioned is probably ( from the early 2010s.  Lessons learned from that study lead to a lot of improvements that were incorporated into the gene transfer therapy trials that are currently underway for both FVIII and FIX.  So even though the patients' steady-state factor activity level is not very high, I believe the levels have persisted for almost 10 years now.\n\nHere is ( from earlier this decade that presents a theory about the immune system response to the gene therapy vector.  This  explains how the immune system may not only attack the vector but also some or all of the liver cells that have received the payload of the vector. I have had the opposite. I got up to 10% around week 12. ALTs went form 21-43 and now I am back at 2% after being on steroids for 4 weeks. Things are not looking good :( Which clinical trial are you enrolled in? Is managing high levels of clotting just taking stuff like warfarin and heparin? I hate it when they give a hard number like that instead of a range. Doctors then take that value as gospel and those of us who bleed more than the data are just restricted to less factor. It took 10 years of being hospitalised annually and with my joints deteriorating badly until they finally increased the dose.\n\nAnd then it was only because the predominant thinking in the medical community had changed and the magic number had been moved upwards.\n\nAsk me how I feel about that. I would assume so but I am not sure what the procedure would be for gene therapy patients.", "Hemophilia treatment resolved 96.5% of bleeds within one hour in study ", "HemoAware Hello all,\n\nI was on here a year ago asking about Jesse Clark and HemoAware due to a concerning behavior and tone being used under the veil of a nonprofit organization.  \n\nHe promptly came into the subreddit and decided to insult and me for my curiosity.  \n\nMostly let him go but since he has decided to remain hostile and behave in a libel and fraudulent way it is my duty as a member of the community to advise against supporting this nonprofit.  \n\nThe nonprofit clearly views the community with contempt and is appealing to the ignorance of those in the community to cause outrage rather than provoke discussion.   \n\nMore over HemoAware has fabricated personnel and fraudulently promoted conferences that were never actually booked when I called the hotel to verify.  \n\n This is my experience and research on the man and the company, and I want to invite you all to draw your own conclusions by asking of HemoAware as you would any other chapter that is vying for a piece of the pie.  \n\nOr just stick around and see what other ridiculous things about me come from his adorable mouth.

Everyone at haemotology and gyno  thought that the coil would work but no luck so far and if anything it is made things even more irregular. I have diagnosed von willebrands however haemotology seem to blame gynaecology whenever they can even though I have never been diagnosed with a gynaecology problem.  I am seeing a private gyno and we have talked through some options, pill alongside coil ruled out as this can only be a temporary fix, depo injection ruled out because they are nervous that I would just bleed the whole 12 weeks and we have been talking about zoladex. Of course as a 19 year old the thought of temporary menopause freaks me out a lot but I was looking for some advice from anyone who is been in a similar situation, who has been on zoladex or someone who has ANY advice on anything that could help.

We currently have about 2 years worth of this stuff stashed in a dresser in the spare room. I would love any ideas on what to do with it all. It seems like such a waste to toss it out. Alcohol swabs are ALWAYS useful for household cleaning, do not waste those!\n\nIf they are not decent bandaids just throw them out. I have heard that some people donate to their local veterinarian, but have not tried this myself. The idea is that most (human) medical providers would be unlikely to trust medical supplies from an unknown source, but vets can always use syringes, needles, etc. for treating their pro bono cases.\n\nI would be curious if anyone here has actually done this. Yup vets and animal rescue places will snap them all up in a second! yeah i have a boat load of extra supplies too! honestly, you might check with a local university nursing school, or maybe a community college that offers medical classes, they might need them for teaching students how to give shots or something. Definitely worth checking on. : ) Took a while to develop the habit, but when ordering I would have them leave out the supplies so I could use up most of my excess.  Have your pharmacy leave the supplies out for a while and use them up.  It is difficult to give medical supplies away to a legitimate source.  Maybe veterinary clinics as suggested.   Maybe homeless or women's shelters?  I suppose it will depend on the people you speak with and their needs. I have some friends who work in a pop up hospital in Haiti every year so I always save any extra supplies for them to take with. I hate the extra amount of supplies and packaging used for every treatment. It feels like such a waste every time\nI mix one. I have had the pharmacy not ship them out for awhile at times like others said. You might also check with your local hemophilia group. I know the one in my local area used to take some of the extra supplies. One of the programs that supplied factor to low income patients did not provide supplies so they used it for that. That may not be true anymore. It never made sense they were supplying the factor and not the supplies. Local clinic that provides free care gets my excess Med supplies but also I have talked to my specialty pharmacy about what supplies I do and do not need so it is not as excessive as it used to be Thank you all for your suggestions! my clinic takes expired clotting factor kits and donates them to clinics in third world countries because the expiration date does not really matter haha.", "Anyone attending the 2012 Texas Bleeding Disorder Conference?

After a round of golf this morning and infusions before and after, my most notorious target joint (elbow) is painfully acting up. \n\nThere is a retail cryotherapy in town and I am thinking that a few sessions of -200 degree cold therapy may do wonders.\n\nThere is mixed literature on the use of LC for hemophiliac bleeds, some say it is beneficial and good for pain management and others say it could interrupt the healing process.\n\nAnyone got any anecdotes, either having gotten it done or been warned off by the hematologist? it is not what you think it is. I have done it and any relief from it is very temporary if any at all. like going out in the cold and warming back up. it is a little different because the cold is a different type of cold, but the end result is basically the same. I heard a lot of stories, but after doing i quickly realized it was utter BS and a waste of time. the by far better option is ice and compress. I figured everyone just thought it was because of the hype behind it.\n CBD salve has helped me tremendously when they get bad. it helps calm that shooting pain the joints cause and helps relax away muscle bleed pain. it doesnt take it away, but makes it tolerable to relax. \nthe cryo stuff may help some people with some things that I cant see, but for us it is not really beneficial to the relief we need.  Thanks, I am and will be doing lots of RICE already and have a tube of bengay handy.\n\nI was not really expecting a miracle from it, but the place by me is offering a pretty cheap new client special, if the pressure/pain is relieved for just a few minutes that plus the curiosity factor is worth it to me.  it is worth it to try it once. it is an experience. it may be helpful to you. a lot of places have specials for new people. I never liked Bengay, it helped some, but smelled horrible. mine will get to hurting like someone had a knife in it and twisting sometimes. nothing really helps me then except the knowledge that it will be over soon. I usually just grit my teeth and ride those out. they can get pretty bad. my targets are my elbows as well. I actually found that biting down and using them helps me more than anything sometimes as well. I think that sometimes a nerve gets pinched or something because I have some damage in both elbows. that being said, if it is that kind of pain, the cryo stuff will make that hurt worse. all it will do it drive the pain deeper because your body is shivering and tensing up reacting to the cold. I feel like that would increase the pain rather than help it.  I know what you mean about that kind of stay up all night pain, :[  \nbut this is not that bad, just dull pressure pain from the swelling. \n\nI will update you with how my experience goes tomorrow. Thanks for the insight. I have never done cryotherapy as such, but reading the word brought back memories of this crazy contraption my parents made me use. \n\nIt was like a 1-2 gallon cooler, with input and output valves connected to hoses. Those were connected to a knee brace (my real bad target joint when I was a kid.) You filled the cooler with some water, a crap ton of ice, and salt. You lifted it up so gravity would fill the knee brace with freezing water then locked off the ports so the water would stay in the brace. Sweet god it was cold and hurt nearly as much as the bleed we were ostensibly treating. You know how when you use ice packs at first they are super cold but after a few minutes you are a little numb, and also they start to warm up a little? Not with this infernal machine! Every few minutes they would drain the *slightly* warmer water from the brace and get some good arctic water back in the mix. I cannot tell you if it helped or not, I am sure it reduced swelling if anything. \n\nIf cryotherapy is anything like that, I would need a therapist to work through these resurgent feelings. It might be worth the story, just to say you have tried it. Let us know how it goes if you do.  Yikes, haha, from what I understand the cold therapy of this lasts about a minute. \n\nI have definitely done therapeutic ice baths though and actually like them a little, of course it sucks while you are in the ice water but feels great afterwards.   Like in those cool steel tubs that pitchers use after baseball games? I always wanted to do that too lol. I always assumed it would be too intense for me. Especially outlining my obvious ice phobia I just realized I have lol. Not the same thing at all, but have you tried ( Good stuff, I have a roller bottle of that. Ha nothing that fancy just a couple bags of ice and a full tub. Those of you having the elbows as target joints, do your hands get cold easily. I am 61 with a lot of lost motion in both of my elbows, and my hands get cold very quickly. My previous doc said it was my heart, but my feet do not seem effected. My arms neither straighten nor bend completely. I was just wondering. &gt;this crazy contraption my parents made me use.\n\nA cryocuff? I still have mine and even use it a couple times a year. Absolute lifesaver if a bit tricky to manage solo. Yeah that looks like it! Very cool. I just use ice packs now when I need it.  Not really no, but you should be doing hand gripping exercises to improve blood flow, that will help. ", "Hemophilia A Severe Adult and got the Pfizer Covid Vaccine today :) I infused before I went, and currently laying in bed because I feel like poop. Send me memes. SubQ? Same and this is how I have been feeling ( SubQ? Was is a regular shot in the muscle or did they do it subcutaneous? Was in the muscle of my left arm Severe A, 47 yrs, got my second dose today of Pfizer. Completely forgot to factor up today since I  did my prophy yesterday.  Fortunately, I am feeling fine with no issues from the vaccine. Hang in there. Anyone know if the Astra Zeneca vaccine is problematic for haemophiliacs? SubQ administration is not in the Label or prescribing info of pfizer, moderna or J&amp;J vaccines. They all say administer intramuscularly. So, getting someone to give the shot SubQ probably will not happen, especially at a vaccination site or even a pharmacy, they do not deviate from the label as that would be \u201coff label\u201d use of the medication. Severe A, mid 30s. Second Pfizer already, only had the swollen armpit lymphnode on the side I got the shot next day, and that lasted about 1 day. No fever, chills or body aches with #2. \n\nIf you have a reaction to the vaccines that is your draw of the straws. There are no statically proven factors that to correlate having or not having a specific reaction, and I would say having hemophilia is not significant to the prediction of any reaction outcomes. Good to know. Just want to make sure it does not cause any muscle bleeds. The needle being stabbed into your muscle and a liquid volume being pumped will always create a potential to have a bleed. But do factor before, ask your hematologist prior if you have question. \n\nAlso, do not flex your muscle or clinch anything be relaxed as possible, it helps with IM shots. They cannot do subq for covid. fc. 53YO mild type A. I got my 2nd Moderna last week. Body aches, nausea, and fever for a day, but am fine.

Hello guys and gals,\n\nI was wondering if some people with VWD Type 1 oder low VWF would like to share their stories. How did you get diagnosed and does it affect your day to day life?\n\nPersonally, I\u2018ve never had any problems with my VWD. It was diagnosed shortly after my birth and since then I\u2018ve never needed therapy or suffered from the typical symptoms. You could say I\u2018m one lucky bastard\u2026\n\nBut I know that VWD is the most common bleeding disorder, yet most people and even doctors barely know about it.\n\nIs it because most of us with Type 1 just slip under the radar for being asymptomatic? hi! I literally only got diagnosed because of my periods, and even then it took 2 years to get tested. I have never had a nosebleed or anything! I basically live a normal life (aside from my periods which are pretty intense and have caused the need for some stuff) and when I was a kid all my bruising was explained by me playing a sport / being outdoorsy. Now I have just started to notice little symptoms, such. But yes! We fly under the radar so often Heavy periods to the point where I became severely anemic.  Got referred by my primary care provider to a hematologist, she thought my migraines and heavy periods were related. Hem/Onc sends me back to Ob-Gyn to be checked out for gynecological reasons for the heavy bleeding (I had had a Mirena iud placed for heavy periods after testing negative for fibroids or endometriosis - I then had the Mirena removed - and the heavy periods came back).  Finally, I beg the Hem/Onc to test me for Von Willebrand's.  He is like \"ok why not.\"  My tests came back positive for VW Type 1.  I genuinely wish Hematology and Oncology were not mixed as specialities. I have had nosebleeds essentially since I was born. I will get one or two every couple of days which can really get in the way of my day at times. Afterwards I feel grim because of the amount of blood I lose comparatively to a normal person, and I suppose it sort of stacks up over time. I remember being at school and being sent home many many times due to protocol with a nosebleed over 20 minutes. The problem was of course, I virtually always have nosebleeds over 20 minutes. Because of it being low VWD, I never got it tested or anything prior to this year. I ended up having to have hand surgery after a nasty injury, and during surgery I apparently bled much more than anticipated, leading to the doctors taking some of my blood and testing it. As it happens I have somewhere between low VWD and type 1. It does not particularly affect me, I am just cautious in situations where I may get cuts etc. OMG THIS. I am STILL being sent to obgyn constantly to treat my bleeding even though I have a VWB type 1 diagnosis. It is like I say the word period and they just stop listening Four years ago, I had a period that lasted 215 days, so a little under 7 months. I thought that my period would go away eventually, but it never did. I had a heavy flow, migraines, nausea, bruised super easily, and would even faint multiple times a week. I got to the point that I could not hold food down, and got really weak. Finally, I told my primary care doctor and was recommended to an OBGYN and a Hematologist. It took about 1 month to get a diagnosis and to be put on birth control. I was also put on an extremely high dosage of iron because I was severely anemic.", "Gym shame?

Even the perfect regimen for any of us does not stop the bleeding completely. You have been doing the right things to this point. Hopefully your hematologist has a plan for breakthrough bleeds. I coincidentally have an appt with her tomorrow. But that is even more proof that god hates me. I was so excited to tell her I have not been bleeding since this dose has become stable. Good job pressing them to get what you needed! Yes , treating type 1 vwd with prophylactic infusions of humate P  or alphanate is becoming more common place. Because it works. I hope more people with type 1 vwd figure this out. I think it is really common for people with hemophilia to be under treated due to cost of factor, poorly trained doctors, and hemophiliacs not understanding that treating heavily really works, also it is a pretty big pain in the ass to infuse every other day so that is probably part of it. But I have always pushed for proper care and have infused every other day for the past 40 years (until Hemlibra, no I infuse once a week or less). I am severe A, 47, and have almost zero joint damage, and am in better shape now than I have ever been. I wish dr\u2019s and patients would realize that it is possible to live a relatively normal life with proper care. Do not get me wrong, I have spent plenty of time hurt and recovering from bleeds. Having hemophilia is hard. But it does not have to destroy your body if you are patient, informed, and I guess a bit lucky. But mostly , if you have the ability to get factor when you need it, it allows your body to recover as well as anyone else. The best advice I have is to try to reframe your perspective: now that you are seeing your hematologist tomorrow, you have more data than you did last time (that being, your current treatment plan is not satisfactory). It sounds like she listened to you before, and I think it is likely she will do it again. I wish I could tell you better news. Unfortunately your story is very common. Once you find the right provider, though, the downs are less severe and farther apart from each other. Thanks for this. It is hard to look at things from different perspectives when you feel so depressed about it. Sometimes I just need people to tell me the other perspective so I can understand.

My current pain level from the ankle is horrendous. I walk around in a moon boot to take some pressure of. I am terrified of surgery. Had an uncaught bleed a few years ago that completely destroyed my hip. Then had a slight spill that made it worse. With exercise I have gotten through it and it now barely hurts. Every year I tell myself I am going to get that hip replacement surgery, but 8 years later, here I am. Not going to lie, I cry about it sometimes. It hurts when the weather changes. I just pretend it is no big deal, and that usually gets me through it. I am even starting to believe it is no big deal!  Haha, thanks friend! I probably got to little to woe is me there for a second. NO BIG DEAL!!! I make sure I am behind others so that I do not feel like I am holding them up. People outpace me sometimes because of this but in general I do not mind catching up. Realistically, you probably should be first because then you are the pace car but I feel self conscious that way.\n\nIt does obviously depend on who you are with... friends that know generally try to go my pace and do not worry about it.

Depends on your age, lifestyle, access to medication etc. There was not any prophylaxis when I was growing up and I could have minded myself a bit more. Now my knees are shot with arthrosis and both need to be replaced at some point in the future. Can totally relate to this... I have always been a \u201cfast walker\u201d and I wonder if that maybe contributed towards my ankle issues over time but now I very much find myself having to keep a good and relatively quick pace as if I am walking too slowly I feel it grinding and will get more pain... I start to feel more restriction of movement too. One phrase I heard from a fellow bleeder before was \u201cmotion is my lotion\u201d when talking about their ankle pain Dont let it get to you. I dont limp badly every day so if it is a slow day and friends havnt noticed I just yell \" good people wouldnt leave a cripple behind\".

Im severe B and have never had any issues with masturbation or fairly rough sex. If it is a consistent problem I would suggest trying some lubricant and see if that works better. You may just be gripping a little too much. Also I would suggest not doing it multiple times in a short period of time. Ok this may sound random, but how long after masterbating  / sex does it hurt? Even more random but does it happen while you are sleeping?

That is kind of why I am asking. Thanks evereyone for your responses :) Usually with the bleeds i have had in my penis, there was noticable swelling. Have you tried treating, then jerking off, and seeing if it hurts? If it hurts even though you treated you might want to get your factor levels checked to make sure they are where they need to be. I have had my levels checked and sometimes it hurts even then (after getting medication). I guess ill just wait a few days and then see what happens when treated.

I was wondering if anyone here has dealt w/ depression/anxiety/adhd or chronic inflammation alongside a bleeding disorder. I was on citalopram for almost 2 years. they were the best 2 damn years of my life. I went off after i randomly got severe bruising and it was not until a year later when I tried a different but similar medication that I soon found out i had a bleeding disorder (I was 20 yrs old). I also started getting insane inflammation especially in my sinuses that causes chronic pain but all medications I try to take including turmeric cause bruising. \n\nanyways, I was considering going back on anti-depressants but am conflicted.  my quality of life was a lot better  and for a long time I did not bruise at all.  It was not until a while before I went off that chunks of my leg turned black and looked  like gangrene. I am very hesitant to try out other medications bc this worked for me and I do not want to mess around w/ a bunch of different chemicals in my brain.  has anyone here dealt w/ this dilemma? \n\nI am considering just risking the negative effects  of VWD over the negative effects of the depression that have  made the last 3 years of my life really well depressing. The chronic pain on top of the depression just feels like way too much to deal w/ together. but I do not know if I am making a mistake. \n\nanyways if this is not allowed (im new here) feel free to let me know or just remove it. Personally, I think if I found citalopram was working, I would stick with it. AFAIK the side effects do not include bleeding issues. I will say that my early 20s, though, were about the worst period in my life for spontaneous bleeding, so your issues while taking citalopram may have been coincidence.\n\nI know bleeding sucks, and having to find new routines to accommodate the risks is really, really difficult. But I think if even you say your quality of life was better with citalopram, then it is worth going to a doctor and discussing it again (or maybe a different SSRI depending on side effects). Chronic pain unfortunately is common to a lot of us as we get older. Just keep avoiding anything but Tylenol that is OTC, stay away from a lot of supplements too (my hematologist recommended I not take glucosamine, for example, based on other patients' stories). Chronic pain and depression though can be severely debilitating.\n\nIf you have a bleeding disorders chapter nearby you might be able to find online support or communities, too. They may have some advice and resources available to you locally. With the pandemic it is harder to find big resources and honestly bleeding disorders never really had \"big\" ones to begin with. Hope you will be doing better soon. Hey there, I have type 3 vWD as well! Are you on any sort of clotting medication? I have been on effexor (venlafaxine) for the better part of a year now. I do experience some bruising and nosebleeds, but I inject my meds about 2x a week to keep it under control. Let me know if you have any questions! i have tranexamic acid but i only really take it if i get a bad cut! i can check w/ a doctor about potentially using it more often or inquire about effexor. \n\nAlso, just curious when were you diagnosed? I did not get diagnosed until I was 20 and only started having symptoms when I was 19. I had been on SSRIs on and off since I was 15 and they did not cause bruising or bleeding and used tylenol regularly at all. nosebleeds have never been a problem for me either. the bruising I developed out of nowhere so just wondering if its normal for symptoms to naturally fluctuate w/ type 3 vWD! \n\nalso does effexor help at all w/ bruising? I was diagnosed at 9 months because of bruising and bleeding. I use tranexamic acid as a booster to my injection meds (humate for me). Von Willebrand's as a disease is very unique for every person. Some type 3's are very severe and get all sorts of bleeding issues, others have very little problems (aside from major surgeries). I am one of 2 adults with type 3 in my province, and I bleed a lot more than he does, but I have a type 3 friend in the UK who bleeds much more than me.\n\nPersonally for me, I get joint bleeds, mucosal membrane bleeds (nose, menstrual, gastrointestinal), bruising, and the whole shebang. At 32, I am now dealing with damaged joints and chronic pain. My left elbow is pretty damaged and I have arthritis in it now.\n\nOur factor levels can and will fluctuate for many reasons. Stress and anxiety or depression can affect how we clot. I would recommend getting a blood test to see where you are levels are at. It is common to be low on iron for us type 3's, and anyone with a bleeding disorder really.\n\nSide note, I would avoid omega-3 supplements. I was taking them for my joints, but I started to bruise and bleed into my finger joints REAL FAST. Did not know about that one until recently. thank you sooo much for all this information! i will definitely be more careful about supplements since i have had bad experiences with supplements before i was diagnosed and had no idea what was happening. also good to know about stress/anxiety affecting how we clot. that might explain why it got  so bad at the time that it did!", "Recombinant factor VIII When I was a kid, like 9-10, they give me recombinant for the first time.

This all passed in like 30 min? \nThis happened like 2-3 times\nMy mom says that that factor had something that said hamster or some weird stuff, I have never take recombinant again because of this, but I do not know if it was the brand, or all kind of recombinant\nAnyone have experienced something like this? Any help/info is helpful\n\n-Sorry if my english is weird Just FYI, since we do not know how old you are, we have no idea when you were 9-10 years old I believe all recombinant factor contains traces of hamster protein, as it is produced using murian liver cells. I have never any reaction, are you allergic to mice? Sorry... I am 19 Nope, I have a hamster as a pet, he is in front of me rn... I think I have no allergies  But have you ever eaten a mouse? The proteins in the factor are from it is liver, while commons allergies are of epithelia. Just a thought, I am not sure if that would be related. I have no clue otherwise. I can check the insert of my factor to see if that is a comment adverse event.  If you check that for me would be awesome, I appreciate that This website reflects what my insert says:\n\n\n\nIt looks like pyrexia (fever) and respiratory symptoms are common in greater than 5% of patients, so your reaction is likely not unique. If you would like to try to take factor again, your Hematologist may dose you under observation. Perhaps it was an Allergy you have grown out of.  Flushing (fever-like body heat) and fainting can happen if factor is administered too quickly. That is why some nurses are very hesitant to push quickly. It may have just been that type of reaction? You may do better if the factor is pushed over a longer period.\n\nAdditionally, I do not actually know if this type of flushing/fainting reaction is common in the newer generations of recombinant... The new brands are synthesized from human cells and not hamster kideny/ovary cells. People believe (I have not read the scientific studies, do not quote me) that deriving recombinant from non-human mammal cells is the cause of inhibitor development.\n\nSince your reactions sounded fairly short (30 minutes), it sounds unlikely that it was an allergic reaction. You should talk to your hematologist if you are considering switching to a different type of factor. There are many different kinds of factor products besides recombinant. I still use monoclonal factor derived from human plasma. It is safe and works better than synthetic for a lot of people.   You damn right it works better! im 27 from canada, currently on Zonovate and this bullshit is far from effective, on top of that my hemathologist are all claiming it is legit and i call bullshit on this, they made this synthetic medication only because its better for their pockets to be honest, I miss having Recombinant Factor VIII (which was already better than The new products). I felt safer. I cant have it no more because here in Canada, more precisely the province of Quebec, it is Hema-Quebec who is responsible for the medication contract with companies and now they only deal with synthetic medication companies, I cannot even Pick which one i Want. I only had the choice between Zonovate which is a CHO mollecule and between another type of new synthetic mollecule which i didnt even want to try. My Hemathologist claim that Zonovate works the same and as good as the older products but i call bullshit on that my friend. Your hematologist is wrong and there is data to back it up. I have been on recombinant for years because it is the only thing that works. The synthetic stuff only works for some people. I am on Hemlibra now but even with it I still have to infuse a couple times a month so far. It is an improvement as far as doing less infusions for sure, but I still need factor to recover from anything more than spontaneous bleeding. PM me on here , maybe there is a way to help. But I would try first by really letting your dr know that he does not know as much as he thinks. I am sure of this. It is a lot to explain but I have had a long history working with some of the most knowledgeable people on the subject. Message me and I will see if I can get you some info. The first time I took human plasma derived Factor VIII, I had weird reaction too. Then it went away.\n\nThe first time I took non-human Factor VIII, I had weird reaction too and it went away after several months.\n\nTLDR: that is why when you use a new product, they typically observe you for half an hour after that.", "How do you handle self injection? I was recently put on prophylaxis and I am learning how to self inject from the nurse. So far, I can manage it. Sometimes, I cannot. I am a bit overweight, maybe 30 kg more than what is considered fit. And my veins are small. I am really upset when I cannot inject the medicine and have to go to the nurse. \n\nJust want to hear how some of people who used to be in the same situation have coped up with it.  Use a smaller needle. 27G is very easy to hit. Also you need to straighten the skin on your injection site to ensure vein not roll to the side. \n\nInjection angle is typically 15 degrees. More if vein is deep inside but be careful with those. Not advisable.  I cannot really relate because I have had a port since I was 4, but I hope you get there man! How do you straighten the skin and stick the needle with one hand? When I had ITI\n(2\u00d7day) I asked nurse to find as many veins as possible. Then tried to inject myself to those newly found ones with nurses supervision. In the end she found vein deep in elbow pit and now I am using it 99% of the time. When I was overweight too, I had to nearly use all of butterfly to reach that vein. I used it so much that now I do not feel anything when injecting. you can also train family or friends to help with your injections. my mother and wife help me out when needed. Med tape can help straighten the skin and hold the needle in place once it is in! Also, try to drink lots of water the day before infusing because it plumps the veins. Having a friend or roommate who knows how to inject you can help too. My fianc\u00e9 and dad both know how to do my infusion so I have got backup if I need.  I self infused pretty late in the game at 29, usually it was my mom... Lol I know. I had the issue of veins that roll so yeah it is pretty frustrating in the beginning but you overtime learn when your veins will cooperate. Staying well hydrated helps. Try not to get frustrated, remember, even nurses can miss. I have been stuck 8 times by a nurse, with a vein finder. So just keep calm, and prophy on.\n\nI am now using a buried port, usable veins developed too much scar tissue so I had no choice. Had it for over a year and I am still getting used to accessing it twice a week now that I am recovering from a knee replacement. Remember you can also use ANY veins. Have a nice one on your foot? Go for it! Just takes practice man, you will get it!  Bend your wrist 45 degrees. Widen your fingers as far apart as possible. That will pull the veins in your hand taut.  Hey man! Severe hemophilia type a here, i learned to self infuse at about 14 or 15 when i got my port taken out. At the time they gave me a very stiff rubber ring bigger than tbe palm of my hand to squeeze here and there which was supposed to strengthen my veins. I believe it helped. Maybe try using a stress ball or if possible something with more resistence to strengthen your hands and forearms. Heating the area helps as well.\n\nI am a phlebotomist, and one thing i have learned is that the cephallic vein is the easiest to hit on a patient who may be a bit overweight or even obese. Veins are generally felt not seen, try palpitating with your index finger if you cant see any. You should feel a little bounce almost like a rubber band when your ontop of a vein. \n\nOther than that i would just recommend working out a little bit, if you can manage to do so. Nothing serious, but some pushups and a pull up bar can go a long way. Good luck! \n You Phlebotomists are basically wizards. I have been doing my own infusions since I was 10, and I thought I knew exactly where all the veins in my arm were. Every time I have to give blood it is almost like you guys can see things i cannot. And there is always absolutely zero pain when they do it. Teach me your ways.  &gt; I am recovering from a knee replacement.\n\nOT: How was it? I need both knees done at some point. Not sure if at the same time tho. Woke up nearly painless, walking(with support) the next day. 5 can about in hospital with physical therapy, then PT almost daily since. Feels odd walking with almost no pain. \n\nThree months since procedure, PT reduced to twice a week but still not working yet(construction), less physical work I would have been back to work pretty much after the stitches were out. I also have a hard time sticking myself. My problem is that I use the same veins so I have scar tissue buildup. It is a hit and a miss for me. I try to drink plenty of water before. Also I noticed if I am relaxed, then it is easier for me to find a vein. I also have \"back-up.\" My dad and bro (who also has hemophilia) knows how to infuse me. So does my partner.  Hi,\n\nI have been doing self-treatment for about 40 years - moderate hemophilia A. \n\nThe best thing I was ever told was to chug two glasses of hot water right before I try to find a vein. This helps my veins stand up and has been miraculous in helping me hit veins without frustration and wig only a few errors. \n\nGood luck Find your vein of choice, very much preferable to find one in your arm, grab the end of the hose on your butterfly needle with the hand on the arm you are injecting in, needle in the other hand of course, jam the needle in there while holding on to the hose, grab syringe and inject.\n\nFinding a vein: Drink a large glass of water beforehand, pump your hand while flexing your upper body as much as you can (you do not need a Tourniquet really). You can do the ritual slapping of the vein if it is not popping as well as you would wish and see if it helps, I was never a fan of doing that tho it did seem to help sometimes. If you are a bit overweight and it is getting in the way of veins showing up I guess you will just have to lose a few kilos. Harsh, but hey. \n\nGetting the needle in: Press the fingertips of your index and middle finger all over the place while pumping hand and flexing your upper body, get an internal vision of a 3D model of how the vein travels beneath the skin (if it is not popping out). Put any fear of pain out of your head and aim true, it gets easier every time. \n\nIf you are still struggling I can make a Youtube video and show you how easy it can be :) Been doing it every other day for 9 years now.", "I do not know where to turn....  I have been with a hemophiliac for over two years. He is been on pain medicine his whole life. Two days we broke up because I cannot handle his addiction any longer. He refuses to admit he has a problem, but family and friends have witnessed it. He lies and steals to get his next fix. I believe more than anything that he is my soul mate. But he is killing himself slowly each day. He is a fellow redditor. No amount of talking has helped him realize he needs help. I love him more than life itself,  but I cannot fix him. I know with hemophilia life is not easy.  He uses his disease as an excuse for pills. I do not really know what I am asking. I just do not know where to turn from here. I feel like I am giving up on him and just running away. I guess I am just wondering if this is something that other hemophiliacs have battled with as well. ", "Hemophilia: Causes, Symptoms &amp; Diagnosis  \n\nWorld Hemophilia Day is held annually on April 17th to increase the awareness of hemophilia and other bleeding disorders.Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. People suffering from hemophilia have insufficient blood clotting factor (factor VIII or factor IX) in their body. Based on the amount of clotting factors, hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe. Hemophilia can be life-threatening if bleeding occurs within vital organs. There are three types of hemophilia. ( Why do you keep posting this here? People on this sub already know everything on this page and more, and it is not particularly special or well written regardless. Thanks, I forgot what hemophilia was and that I have it \ud83d\udc4c", "How often do you give up? How do you deal with the fact that a normal person can always outwork you. \n\nYour 100% , might be his 60-70% (arbitary guess) \n\nHow do you deal with the challenge of life like this? i dont. i dont gauge myself to others. we are all on our own path. YES!!! \ud83d\udcaa You ARE a normal person Great reminder. In a way yes. :p \"in a way normal\" is more than enough :) I learnt a long time ago that there is no normal and we are all on our own path. Surely that is could be said of anybody regardless of if they have haemophilia ? My dad has the condition and has out earned his family and travelled the world You deal with this challenge by always giving 100% no matter what. You get out if life what you put into it  You will get nowhere throwing yourself a pity party. Hemophillia sucks, but so many have it much worse. Be thankful that you are able to do what you can and be grateful to be alive.\nHemophilia does suck, but it also makes you look at the world differently and makes me try harder so I usually out do most able body people because few people really try anymore, it is not as hard as you may think to out do people. Just dont set unattainable goals. What is huge accomplishments for me seem like nothing to other people and that is ok, because I accomplished something I was proud of. \nI am well accomplished and have been successful in life. Hemophilia has always been there and had to be dealt with, but it never held me back because I didnt let it. When I tell people they cannot believe it because of what all I can do. I never say no I cant, I say I will figure it out and give it my best try. Never be afraid to step out there and try something new. Most things that seem like you cant do, can be done just more slowly and delicately. \n\n Everyone can be successful and accomplished in their own way. Just take the hand you were dealt and play it the best you can. Never feel like you beneath or less than anyone else. You are no different than anyone. You may have some limitations, but that will never make you less important or less of a person. Always give it your all and take the day by the balls. Even if it is a bleed day, go somewhere in your mind and be successful. Always think success and never failure. Love yourself and have faith in yourself. It is hard. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\nBut thank you... It can be frustrating when other people outwork me but I try to remember to work smarter not harder.  I also try to make everything my own, adding a unique twist/spice to the things I do. \n\nYou are your own person, do not get upset with yourself for not being where other people are. Take note, make adjustments and see if you can get there! \n\nI used to get really upset over my friends being able to EASILY outdo me when we were working out and I would have more rest days than they would because I was in pain.  That is when I realized that I did not need to do exactly what they were doing to get similar results. I just had to do some research/thinking and and adapt. No matter who you are there will always be people who can out perform you.\nDo not compare yourself with anyone else.  Accept yourself for who are and be happy with that.  Sure there are limitations with Hemophilia, however those need not affect every aspect of your life. \n\nYou can look at Hemophilia as a burden or as something that makes you unique.  You have limitations but you also have strengths.  Hemophilia has taught me so many things.  High pain tolerance, perseverance are just some examples. \n\nIt is okay to feel bad.  Everyone has days but do not let those days become weeks or months.  There is no benefit on dwelling on things you cannot change.  Focus on those things you can impact to make your life better.  Besides therapies are imprvoving and someday you may not be that different. \n\nJust keep doing what you can.  Be content or even happy with yourself. Thanks :)) This. I have realized how many people have varying medical problems that they have to deal with every day. There are far less \"normal\" people who have no serious medical issues than there are that do not. The human body is not perfect in any way. &gt;re all on our own path.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ReplyshareSaveEdit\n\ntbh my hinderences often times comes from factors outside of hemophilia, no pun intended. I wish you the best.  My previous post makes it sounds easy to change your mentality, it is not.  It took me a long time to come to a place that I would say I was heppy. But  I have learned that you will set yourself up for failure if you try to compare yourself to others.\n  An ophthalmologist gave me some advice.  My eyes arent  great and I was feeling a bit negative about it.  He told me if I was ever feeling bad that I was welcome to come back to his office and sit in tbw waiting room.  He said the other patients would be ecstatic just to be able to see the big \"E\" on the chart.  It would be the difference of being ablt to live independently.  Basically he told me to stop complaining. It is true for Hemophilia, there are still patients with other disorders who have it worse. I have accomplished more with my limitations than others have that are fully able. \n\nThat being said, I used to always compare myself to others. I always felt unsure if I were doing the right thing. I was always asking others what I should do. Until I was in a hole so deep that I just did not see any way out.

I am a severe Haemophila A (&lt;1%) with chronic arthritis in my left ankle (was not diagnosed until I was three, so you can imagine the early damage), muscle wastage and all that jazz. I have recently been trying to find ways to readjust the way I walk. I never really noticed how much I favoured my right leg until I moved into an apartment complex with stairs and now it is something I think about and feel the effects of all the time. I know the lack of movement in the joint due to the arthritis is the main issue but I was wondering if my fellow haemophiliacs could weigh in with any advice for non-invasive stretches for ankle movement and general exercises you have used in your life to get control back over your legs? Or even outdoor activities or sports that you have found have helped you along the way? Recumbent bike exercise machine has helped me maintain my legs and strengthen them. Although its my right elbow that is my main issue giver, I do have a right ankle that gave me loads of trouble when I was younger. All the bleeds over the years have caused it to sort of bow out when I walk like a semi circle when I lift it to step. My physical therapist offered me a shoe insert and it made it much easier on my ankle walking. You see my body was purposely avoiding bending that ankle joint as much as it could, that is why I just developed a natural semi circle movement. Now as long as I have shoes on with that insert I walk normally and do not have any pain.  \n\n\nNot sure if any of this info is helpful, but these are the inserts I am talking about  \n ( My biggest problem joint is my left ankle as well. I had surgery for the arthritis and post surgery my leg deteriorated a lot since I had to be off of it. You can totally do some strengthening exercises specifically for your ankle. Low impact, isometric exercises is mainly what I did at first. Over time these little exercises really help. I would not be running on it or anything that has a hard impact.

My husband was tested and also diagnosed with mild hemophilia A after our kiddo was dx'd.\n\nThey have both always been easy bleeders, but both seemed to have very mild issues compared to everyone else w/ factor deficiencies. My daughter would get nosebleeds that would last for hours, minor cuts and scrapes would take a long time to stop bleeding, but never any joint bleeds or internal bleeding once her gut healed. \n\nMy husband had to get an outpatient surgery earlier this year and when they tested his factor levels they were totally normal. His hematologist officially removed the hemophilia diagnosis from his chart and said he does not have it.\n\nMy daughter's hematologist re-ran the Von Willebrand's panel on her a couple weeks ago, since apparently the tests have improved a ton in the last decade. Her test also came back perfectly normal, and the nurse told us my daughter does not have a bleeding disorder after all. The doctor is out of town so I am waiting for a call when they return to get more details.\n\nObviously we are stoked and counting ourselves very lucky! But I am confused. My kid still gets bad nosebleeds every time she takes ibuprofen (which I know is a no-no with a hemophilia diagnosis but sometimes it was the only thing that would help her joint pain, which is a whole 'nother thing, so we tried to use our best judgment and only use as last resort). \n\nMy question is this: Has anyone ever heard of someone being diagnosed then un-diagnosed with hemophilia? Is there something else that could have caused husband's and daughter's factors to be simultaneously and temporarily low enough for diagnosis? \n\nSorry for the length and my apologies if this is not the right forum for my question. I know you all are facing much bigger problems and would probably love to be in this situation. I just do not want to get too confident about the diagnosis being lifted if there is the possibility of a different bleeding issue or something we should address. Thank you! I am not a doctor and definitely not your doctor, but this is my experience: whenever someone or some clinic took my factor levels and it was not at my HTC, my hematologist and nurse would tell me not to pay much attention to those levels. I have had an ER tell me my levels were as high as 15%, and that is when I was in there for an iliopsoas bleed.\n\nDo your husband and daughter see a bleeding disorders specialist? A lot of ER and GP referrals send you to what is primarily an oncology clinic. Those doctors can be the best oncologists in the world but have less experience with bleeding disorders than someone who focuses more on hematology. If your husband and daughter have issues with bleeding and were even in the past diagnosed based on levels, I would probably want to get a second opinion. Especially if more surgery is in the near future for either. \n\nIf your husband was diagnosed with Type A previously, I am also a bit confused why your daughter's vWF levels were tested...if she is a carrier of A, and symptomatic, her FVIII levels would be affected. Thanks! She goes to a combination hematology/oncology clinic - it is the only one in our area, I think. \n\nThe blood was sent to a special testing center in Wisconsin, and they were seen by the same hematologist they have always seen. My daughter's factor VIII levels were low when she was diagnosed as an infant, and her vWF was fine - which is weird, because vW runs in my husband's family but hemophilia does not. Still, they did lots of testing when she was a baby and that was the diagnosis. We also determined that she responds well to desmopressin and have used that before minor surgical stuff. \n\nShe had not been back to the hematologist for years because she never had any bleeding issues we could not handle with just regular home care, despite playing lots of sports. We chalked it up to that her factor deficiency was mild, and besides she was just a symptomatic carrier. \n\nWe went back to the hematologist for the first time in forever because she started her period and it was pretty heavy, and the doctors had told us when she was a baby that she might need some intervention for the bleeding when menses began. They ran a CBC then and she was not anemic. They also gave us some guidelines for how much blood is too much, gave us a list of sports to avoid and said they wanted to run the vWF testing because the tests had improved a bunch and they wanted to verify the diagnosis she got as an infant. \n\nShe is really a pretty healthy kid, though she does have a handful of medical issues including autoimmune, gastrointestinal problems and hypermobility. Treating her autoimmune stuff would be much simpler if she can have basic anti-inflammatory drugs, so I am hoping the drs are right on the no-more-bleeding-disorder ruling. \n\nMy husband's Factor VIII levels were really close to but not quite reaching the \"normal\" range when he was first diagnosed. My daughter's factor VIII levels were lower than his at the time. But now both normal. I am guessing one or the other tests were just done incorrectly. Here is hoping it was the first batch and not the latest results. \n\nI think you are correct - a second opinion is probably the best move.  I had a feeling it was a clinic like that. They can be very convenient because they are all over the place. But those doctors just do not have a lot of experience with bleeding disorders. And if your husband -does- have hemophilia A and ever needed factor, they probably would not be able to help him much. They would say go to the ER, because they would not have any on site and they would not be able to get any for at least a couple days.\n\nIf you can (big if for some, I know), try to get to a major metro area to see if they have an HTC at a teaching hospital. They can do factor assays in-house and you are likely to see someone who is a bleeding disorders specialist. It sounds like your husband and daughter have whatever issue there may be well-managed, so it may be only yearly visits at most required, or maybe even just check-ins via Skype or something with the NP. Desmopressin is probably more than enough for both to manage issues if they are borderline, but in general desmopressin is not to be taken for more than four or five consecutive days, so bigger episodes would need something else. It can handle mild FVIII deficiency for some people just fine.\n\nI can say that heavy menses can be an issue for women who are carriers. The Midol formula with acetaminophen instead of naproxin may help during these days. Also an issue is that some doctors are just so, so reluctant to make a diagnosis for carriers, even when that would provide some sort of intervention for bleeding issues, because \"women cannot have hemophilia.\" I will even add that there is a not-insignificant number of people in the community who do not even want \"symptomatic carrier\" used to refer to women with the chromosome anymore, instead just calling them hemophiliacs. I have a sister who has had factor levels come back under normal, will tell them she has a brother with hemophilia A, and (without getting into much more detail) had to undergo a dramatic solution for her bleeding issues. They did not even want to go with a \"symptomatic carrier\" diagnosis. They just kept testing factor levels every couple weeks until it finally read &gt;50%, said she was fine and never tested her again. But she for sure has had abnormal bleeding episodes compared to other women.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like life for your daughter is better with NSAIDs even if they do cause some minor bleeding issues. And there is at least one person on this sub who I know says he will take ibuprofen if his pain is especially bad, knowing it will probably cause a bleed for him later.\n\nAnyway now I am just rambling. I hope your family finds a good result, and hopefully a conclusive one too. This is hugely helpful info, thank you so much!!! Mild Hemophilia A, I believe, is defined as 5% to 50% of normal Factor 8 levels. Do you know the percentage they showed as during the second tests?\n\nHemophilia is really just a term for a variety of different mutations that can affect those particular clotting factors.", "is white sugar bad?? also salt  I have never heard anything about it?

We could all probably benefit from making some healthy changes.  Sounds like it is working well for you.  I would say you would have a hard time finding a doctor to confirm a correlation between sugar/salt and bleeds but if it is working for you, that is all that matters.  You are probably living an overall healthier lifestyle which helps with bleeds to a degree.  I have noticed stress seems to bring on more problems for me so maybe reducing your sugar/salt intake have had a positive impact on your blood pressure which might lower your number of bleeds or inflammation.

That aside, at least consider the fact that you do not know how the drug might interact with any medication you might be on. I am pretty sure that there have been no studies involving the consumption of lsd and say factor viii. Probably no ill effects, but do you want to be the one to find out that there is? Back in my college days it was not a problem for me. That being said, you might not be aware of little bumps or bruises during your trip, so make sure you are completely dosed up beforehand.

Veines dont hurt when you inject and needle goes through nicely.\n2nd injection feel the pain of needle going through vein a bit but still fine\n3rd injection veins from outside still look fine but when you inject you definitly feel more pain in that vein and it feels stiffer somehow\n4th injection hella pain and vein feels a bit harder to penitrate.\n\nNow why the fuck does this happend. It also only somtimes happens and i want to know if i should be worried. I also want to know if this happens to other people. Like it seems at though the factor 8 goes in nicely but it just hurts putting the needle there which it shoudlent. Cause sometimes it just doesnt hurt at all. Idk man.\n\n\nAlso when you are injecting and some liquid goes on the outside of the vein and you make that small bubble i usally try to save it by finding the vein again which i do. But it still created s bubble when i find it. Its so weird.  Should i just give up after it created the bubble and inject elswere? Ty Ask your doctor You can get scar tissue if you use the same vein every time. That is why you need to rotate your veins. Wait at least a few days before going in the same place twice. I try to wait a week when I can, and I have 3 veins I rotate through. \n\nFor your 2nd question. Whenever I miss the vein and create a bubble, I try again in a different vein. But usually I can tell if I am not in the vein as soon as I try to push. If there is a lot of resistance, try pulling back, and readjust if there is no blood return. That can prevent the bubble in the first place. So i used 3 diffeent veins as well but somtimes still feel it alot. Hand veins arent reliable so i try not to use those Different amounts of scar tissue, sometimes too much scar tissue if you are older and the vein is starting to valve up.\n\nIf you are consistently injecting outside the vein, you might want to try a new location. Or more frequently drawing back to see if you are still in the vein. What Is valve up  That Is the thing. I started using this vein only 2 months ago. Doest that take years to happen? Back then when I was using Jivi, I use to exercise first and drink plenty of water before infusion and I get very good pop when inserting the needle in vein. The pop isnt the problems. My veins are big. It just randomly some days hurts alot for no reason What needle gauge do u use Its small. Made for babys. My mom says it damages the vein the least. Im 17 hi there! I have been using the same 3 hand veins for about 20 years and the only time I get pain is if I have gone through the vein, or if I am using a new spot to avoid the scar tissue. \n\nI am trying to use 2 new veins, one in my wrist and one in my hand. They are the most painful because the scar tissue is very new and the wrist one is a roly poly vein and I tend to go right through it and inject outside the vein. Once you build up the scar tissue, the pain should subside. I do not really feel the pokes anymore! I also use baby needles. 27 gauge butterflies. Scar tissue is right. But also superficial thrombophlebitis. Try to find more veins. Trust me I have lost two complete veins where I cannot jab anymore due to so much pain and almost always with no blood in the tube.\n\nEdit- that bubble thing. It means the needle is not in a vein and the fluid goes into the extravenous spaces. Basically between ligaments or muscles depending on depth. It hurts because there is not supposed to be fluid there and it causes expansion of the area. The bubble stays because most of the times if you are pierced a vein through the space and try to use the vein again, some fluid or blood is pushed into the space again through the hole you just made in the vein cause it is easier to push fluid outside the vein than continue forward inside it (venous pressure thing, lots of physiology).

I recently turned 35, but I am feeling better than when I was 20, that stuff is pure magic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I am sure that it is working as expected ( even more than expected tbh ) I want to celebrate it by getting drunker than a Russian sailor this week end ! \n\nI have seen that there are not any side-effects interactions with alcohol but I wanted to be sure about it so if any of you has some experience of getting drunk while on Hemlibra, let me know thanks :) I have gotten drunk a few  times during my time with hemlibra. I have noticed absolutely no ill effects, except maybe the hangovers lol.\n\nI am 31 and have been on hemlibra for about a year, and yes its pure magic as you say. With hemophilia alcohol is not dangerous per se, but being drunk is. Because we can get injured more easily than others and even minor injuries can become major impacts on our lives it is important to be very careful when drinking. Being drunk makes it more likely you will trip, fall, slip or other dangerous events. I have never heard of negative interactions between alcohol and our medicine, but there is definitely a higher risk of injury when getting drunk. Be careful! I have read that alcohol thins your blood making it harder to clot, and I have been in situations where if I started drinking with a mild bleed in my elbow (target), after 3 beers I found that the bleed is aggravated, mind you,  I am talking about instances where I was drinking without Infusion beforehand, and thus later the bleeds really took a bad shape resulting in sharp pain with each movement and swelling, but recently I was drinking a few light beers with my brother (non haemophiliac, lucky bastard) and I had a bleed in my ankle which was going on for 2 days, but this time I had infused before going out, the results were drastically better, not only did I had no problems later, but I slept like a baby too :P. Btw I do not take hemlibra, I take Novo Nordisk recombinant factor VIII. So I can say this with confidence, that drinking with prior infusion is way better (if you are going for a heavy drinking session), as the gentleman above me said rightly, the problem is not that something will go wrong with the side effects of your Medicine clashing with alcohol, rather your own clumsiness will get you in trouble, cheers\ud83c\udf7b I have done the science.

Obviously this advice is not for major traumas where you should be heading to the hospital for treatment anyway. Good luck! For me its just the act of putting an needle into my body now.

Sounds like your insurance does a copayment accumulator :(. Look into applying for PAN assistance. Straight from the manufacturer I do not fit the criteria because of my income :/ So is the manufacturer no longer providing it or is your insurance company saying you cannot use it to pay down your deductible? How did you find that out? Also how are they billing your insurance for your hemlibra?

So they basically try and stick me for my out of pocket maximum costs. But the Eloctate copay assist is good for like 12k a year. So Eloctate pays my out of pocket maximum for the year and then I pay zero co pays for anything for the rest of the year. Same for mine on Cigna.

Never heard of one before. Sounds like an excuse to just eventually kick someone off their insurance when they cannot afford the annual out of pocket max.

Sounds to me like if they can they will snatch the 12k from Eloctate as \u201ccopay assist\u201d then leave me in the lurch when I am now out of medicine and my out of pocket max is still untouched. They found a way to get paid a lot more for a whole years worth of drugs than just my annual out of pocket. Yep +1 for Cigna Does your insurance not own your pharmacy? Cigna now owns its pharmacy I think, so they can effectively pay themselves. I will admit I am not an expert on medical bill or the industry, but my suspicion is the slack gets picked up by the company and it is a way to reduce the mandatory cost or it gets reimbursed or somewhat subsidized by the government.\n\nI used to live in CA where at least if my employers insurance would not cover it, state insurance would kick in.

The company that handles the prior authorizations for them is yet another pharmacy called prime therapeutics. They also do not handle hemophilia. \n\nLong story short the in network pharmacy for hemophilia is CVS specialty. Talk about the run around to get there. I would probably change insurance and such next year. Except it is such a headache getting all the shit together so as to not have a lapse in meds. You might check with your HTC about the free factor programs.

I figure as long as my insurance does not pull that accumulator bs I am not messing with it. It is working and once you are set up there is no worries. Everything flows smoothly. Cvs specialty does an awesome job by me. Rock on. I will keep that in mind if I ever have a \u201cchoice\u201d again. I am in Acreedo for the second or third time and I have always found them to be absolute morons. I was on accredo for what feels like an eternity. Mind you this was like 15 years ago they were pretty decent back then they had some sort of a pharmacy rep lady and she would regularly come and visit me and bring me goodies. Yeeea boi. I have the high deductible plan and lower monthly too. It is nice. Here is hoping the lifetime caps stay high or go away entirely and pre-existing coverage protection stays. Exactly! I hope they are not reading this thread lol If you are in the US, you should call Hemophilia Federation of America to talk about this. It is called an accumulator adjuster program and it is bullshit. HFA might be able to help. Talk to your HTC pharmacists or find one that will help you figure out what to do.  Know that many HTCs will be licenses to dispense factor in neighboring states, so look at all bordering states as well if you need to switch HTCs. Am in the US, will look into this on Monday Hemlibra is billed as a prescription medicine though, not major medical like factor products. I am just going by what the manufacturer copay assistance program stated That sucks mate. Just reading this and all the comments makes me so grateful I do not have to deal with private insurance. Seems like an absolute minefield to navigate, and one that is geared towards making life more difficult for the people who actually need the meds. From my experience in the community, I would recommend reaching out to the Hemophilia Federation of America of the NHF. At the end of the day, it is one of their jobs to support the community with these issues. It could also be very important for them to hear about as more people start switching over to Hemlibra. I hope you get it all sorted out man! No one should have to be out of pocket that much for a life-saving medicine. Also, have you signed up with the Hemlibra copay assistance? Their number is 844-436-2672. They pay the first $5,000 of your prescription deductible.\n\nEdit: oh I see what you are saying I think. I have premera blue cross and the copay worked for me, and not only does it cover my copay for Hemlibra but I now also do not have to come up with the deductible for other prescriptions this year before the insurance kicks in. Which was high, like $1,000 I think. There should be a way to solve the problem your having. It may even just be a misunderstanding.

It sounds really promising, with the half-life and everything, but I have had a great life so far on advate (prophylaxis, so higher overall levels). \n\nJust wondering if I should expect (or not be expecting) some overall QOL improvements from it. Also, if there are any side effects that I should be aware of please let me know.\n\nJust looking for other peoples experiences. I think I have most of the specific medical details that I need to understand what I am getting into.\n\nThank! Hey,\nOn hemlibra for around 3 years.\nIf you not bleedings now, only change i can see is frequency of injections. Once a week or even less frequently. Some get some skin irritation, i did not. \nOh and worst part for me was injecting subcutaneously. Its a bit more painful(depending on injection place) and strange not having a target to puncture. I have been on Hemlibra for 3+ years now after switching from Advate/Adynovate.\n\nDo it. Do it now. You have got your whole life ahead of you and 1 shot/month is as good as it gets. Haem A severe here, 26yrs. I was on advate, then moved to elocta, which was great. I made the switch to hemlibra last December though an loving it. I have not had any side effects!\n\nI am a very out and about type person (obvs not during a pandemic) and regular infusions were really a drag! Also the time spent trying to get a vein and having to do it three times a week was just a lot of hassle. \n\nI am now on hemlbra every two weeks and feeling totally normal, still doing a lot of exercise and no issue with lower factor levels. \n\nAlthough I struggle a little with the new infusion type, just totally unfamiliar! It turns out I am actually pretty bad with needles... \n\nBut based on my experience I would definitely recommend it. Is it once in 15 days for everyone here? Apparently I have also been on it for 3 years or so. It feels weird seeing people say that, because I feel like I would have guessed it is been a year. \n\nAnyway, I am 33 and I already had some semi-fucked joints since I barely ever did prophy. In fact, for quite a few years I put some sense of moral struggle on myself and just did basically nothing so I could reduce my bleeds drastically to save the world millions of dollars. Went from costing like $600,000/yr on prophy to maybe like $100,000/yr by sitting at my computer all day.\n\nI am mostly lucky about my joints... Right ankle a little messed up. Right knee a little messed up, but both of those are just discomfort. Then my right elbow has loss of ROM and it is an annoyance for me, but it is not bad enough for surgery or anything.\n\nI started Hemlibra like 3 years ago... I have had ***one*** bleed since then. Growing up, I had like 3-4 a month. And the one bleed I had was when I was drunk and had a foam sword fight with a friend outside his apartment near the bar. I jumped backward and banged my head, but when I woke up I had apparently twisted my knee and I could barely walk. That was the only bleed I have had for three years. Even when I was as careful as possible, I would still have at least one bleed every other month *doing nothing.*\n\nIf it was not for my messed up joints, I would say Hemlibra is about as close to feeling cured as possible. I just cannot really *feel* like that is true because I have a lifetime of avoidance to being physical along with my joints that will always be messed up. I learned I could drink and play darts/guitar all night, and when my arm would start hurting, all it would be is the pain. All my life that pain would mean a bleed was like 60-70% confirmed, but now it is just pain.\n\nLike other people said, if you are doing prophy, it is still a massive advantage to just not have to worry about the infusions every other day. No joke, before Hemlibra, I went out to the same bar I am talking about. I had taken my Advate *that day.* By the time it was like 3:00am, I already felt like I might have had a bleed. Turns out normal factor really does not hold up as well over time as I always thought.\n\nAnyway, do it. I was taking it every week for a long time until I gained a few extra pounds. Currently taking it every old fortnight. Even ignoring the fact that you take it *drastically* less, so it is *way* less annoying, the actual *medicine itself* is super simple. Just set it out to warm up for 15 minutes, then draw it out of the vial. No mixing or anything. It even lasts like up to 7 days out of the fridge, so you have more leniency on that. Can set it on the table so you remember to take it in the morning, for example.\n\nFunny, I feel like I am advertising, but my doctor actually asked me if I would be willing to advertise one day. Like either a video or a photo for something where I would mention something about playing guitar or whatever. As much as I hate advertisements, this is one case where it is worth it. The younger people are that can get on it, the less they will ever have to deal with messed up joints when they are older. And it is easy.\n\nOnly issue that scared me was their stories about people who were taking Feiba. If you are not on that, 100% do it. I could not do prophy now because I am so depressed and lazy, but Hemlibra is so easy it is hardly a problem. Once a week for me. How many gms per kg of body weight? Definitely a game changer for me. I am pretty sedentary from my joints and hobbies/work. And I frequently would forget to take my every-other-day intravenous shots.\n\nThe best part about Hemlibra for me is that it provides very steady levels of Factor8 (well, fake Factor8). Recombinant meds had wild peaks and troughs so I had to take it in the morning to be the most effective, and would often feel vulnerable in the troughs. I had to check. About 1.5 g/kg. Thanks. My kid is almost four and we switched him from Eloctate twice a week to Hemlibra once every two weeks. From my perspective it is a huge increase in quality of life for him. He went from bruising and swollen joints to as close to a \"cure\" I could ever hope for. The medicine itself seems to be very painful when injected but goes away quickly. I wish you luck in whatever you decide! Thanks for all the input everyone! Seems like the consenses is all positive. Now I just have to wait till my insurance clears it! I am excited for it.\n\nLast small question. What are the shots like? I have never had a problem with getting vaccines or other subQ type shots, but I am so use to advate, wondering how the transition goes. I heard great things about Hemlibra.\nUnfortunately, here in Denmark, we do not get to choose it. They give it only to patients with inhibitors. Very disappointing... we are still pumping 3x week factor8 supplements.. i wish we could choose it. This is exactly my case. I started with Hemlibra while still on trial and it is changed my life. I take it once a month and have had zero bleedings since I started more than three years ago and that is with severe hemophilia and inhibitors. I am sure a subcutaneous injection may be annoying for a four year old but there should not be anything painful about it. It is a lot easier than going intravenous. And yes, this is the closest we have got to a cure. I hope your transition on to Hemlibra goes well for you, and you are insurance give you the all clear to go ahead.\n\nI have severe A with previous inhibitors, infusing with Advate every other day or every day a lot of the time when working before I started on Hemlibra last September. It is been a total game changer for me, the ease of doing subq instead of IV has given my veins a well deserved break. I am not saying it has not come without some minor issues - I react to the injection site (red, itchy and sometimes a small bit of swelling similar to a bug bite) nearly every time, to counter that I was prescribed an antihistamine tablet to take the day before and for a few days after which calms those symptoms massively. 2nd to that I seem to get minor cold like symptoms and a headache at 3-4 days after for a day which is pretty much like clockwork now - some kind of immune response I assume but it is certainly nothing that stops me in my tracks. I would hands down rather be taking this, my target joints are feeling much better, I have not had one single bleed since Hemlibra and I was 1-2 bleeds a month before, due to been active and the peaks and troughs of F8 prophy. The subq is as easy as pie, seriously could not be any more simple and painless compared to 32 year old constantly jabbed veins that were heavily scarred. It is the tiniest of needles and uses syringes depending on the volume/ml that you require. All comes with a handy kit box.\n\nMy only gripe is that I had not been made aware of the different treatment schedules (weekly, fortnightly and monthly). Now I am on fortnightly which has a rather large injection volume, given my skin reactions, I would like to move onto weekly which is just under half the volume and may fix my small injection site reaction. This is currently in discussion for me and hopefully will sort out the small problem I am having, I am rather lean so the larger dose does not have as much body fat to disperse into which makes perfect sense to me to try weekly and less volume/ml.\n\nBest of luck with it all! Luckily he has no problems with needles (subcu or iv). He says the liquid is painful, so I believe him. On Hemlibra for a few years now I highly recommend it as I only have to take it once every other week with severe A and have not had a major bleed since I started (only 2 minor ones)!", "Got this in the mail yesterday, although im much older now, (only 21) and learned alot about my bleeding disorder through the years, im still very glad that they take the time to send these out and inform both young and old  I think back in my day I had Harold comic books.

And any idea how to recover from this? Talk to your HTC and get a referral to a neurosurgeon or PM&amp;R specialist.  You will not need surgery, but you are going to need a complex rehab plan and either of these is usually where you start.  Orthopedics also sometimes does this.  I had a lot of femoral nerve damage after a psoas bleed in November 2015. I had a lot - a LOT - of muscle atrophy in the quad from how long I was immobile, and the lack of mass in the quad is still noticeable to me, though the muscle is not noticeably weaker.\n\nIn my case it took three months of pretty intense physical therapy, three times a week, and I was on the bike and elliptical every day in addition. I happen to love exercise though so I may have done more than necessary. My neurologist suggested to me that my femoral nerve damage would last about two years. I went from fully numb in most spots between hip and knee to eventually just some pins-and-needles feeling in the inner thigh.\n\nYour hematologist should have no issue giving you a referral for physical therapy. Definitely get someone who is comfortable working with a hemophiliac. I have moved PT clinics three times to stay with the therapist I trust and it is worth it. The numbness will, sadly, stay for a little while longer I think. It sucks, and eventually it will probably get a bit itchy as feeling comes back, but after a while you will not really notice it too much except when bursts of feeling come back quickly.\n\nGood luck, I know what you are going through, and it is tough psychologically in addition to the physiological burden. What are the exercises you mostly did? Were u backed up by clotting factors.? I am mostly doing the static quadriceps coz it has less risks of bleeding (i dont have any factors to infuse) .. I can walk fine but i guess my knee has damaged as well sometimes it buckles..still not on bike , i have almost regained control of the leg but there is not much strength, and muscle loss is also evident.  My knee was also buckling a lot, and the kneecap seemed to float around. This was due to muscle loss in the quad and muscles around the knee. It took probably four weeks of exercise to be able to walk with the knee with no problems.\n\nMy factor level is 7%. I did not infuse while doing physical therapy but it had also been five weeks since there was any bleeding. The first time I tore my psoas I did not get therapy, instead I just started adding more body weight on my leg while using crutches, trying to move my leg in a normal walking motion until I eventually did not need crutches. The last two times I have torn my psoas, I had a weak knee requiring therapy. I did many different exercises to strengthen the knee, quad and muscles around the hip.\n\nOn my doctor's orders, and only when I am completely free of any symptoms of the psoas bleed, I usually do squats, dead lifts, weighted lunges, and occasionally some hip raises, three times a week. I would also used a stationary bike or an elliptical machine every day. No running. Things are different here.  Although im a severe i never used any crutches nor any factor, even i dint do any exercise things seems to working fine with me.. i can walk fine..i have lost around 25% of my muscles. I already lost my other leg in a similar psoas bleed that leg is almost arthritic but no structural issues are there.. i m doing a lot of static quqdriceps and things are working out, sometimes your hemophilia doesnt quantified by how much factor level you actually have but by the manifestation of the disease, although i m a severe my manifestations are like of a mild.

Wow did that work great or what. It was amazing! Butterflies are my favorite! I think I use 25 though. I recently got ones that retract with a little button on top, scared the crap out of me at first.  The automatic retraction w/ the spring or the manual ones? The spring ones! The first time I saw one I was getting blood drawn and the nurse used the spring to take it out of my vein without warning me. I have been using them on my own for a couple of months now, but I still take them out of the vein before retracting the needle.  I swear I have had the same thing happen to me!\n\nWe only have manual retraction needles here but the nurses will use that when the needle is still in the vein and I have to tell them to take it out first. 25G are the yellow ones.\n\nDo you use other needles other than butterflies? I have never had it retracted while in the vein, but I have read that some hospitals are recommending their employees do it per their safety protocol. They see it as reducing the chance of employees sticking themselves. It would bother me to have it done that way though. My issue is with the tubing being all coiled up. I try stretching them out and making them straight, but it never works. The second it goes into my arm, the tubing gets coiled again and cocks the butterfly to the side. \n\n\nThere are times when I think about injecting right from the syringe. Yeah, mine too. It was not that bad with the 23G.\n\nI would tape it down but sometimes the change in angle just stops the flow entirely.  I agree completely.

Bleeds are way less frequent and mixing/injecting takes less than five minutes now. My husband switched to Alprolix in January. He finds that the mixing takes, much, much longer than Benefix. He is still taking factor twice weekly for prophy but this will be decreased after his next follow-up appointment.  I was in the clinical trial for Alprolix before it was approved by the FDA, so I was on it for over five years. I started out treating on demand but switched to prophy.  I treated with 100IU/kg every ten days and had almost no bleeds during that time.\n\nI did not notice any difference in the time it takes to mix and infuse Benefix vs. Alprolix.  In addition to fewer bleeds on Alprolix, I found that there were many fewer nights when I was in bed thinking: \"hmmm, that target joint feels weird...is that just joint pain or is this thing going to balloon up?\" What do you think is accounting for the longer mixing time? For me the process was practically the same wth Benefix, it is just that Alprolix is conveniently packaged imo. Not sure exactly. It just seems to take longer for the factor to dissolve than before. The packaging is certainly more convenient than before.  Iv been on Alprolix for about a year now. It is fucking awesome. I was on Benefix before, and the change has been quite drastic for me. No longer have a bi-monthly severe ankle bleed. No more bladder bleeds. And no more intestinal hemotomas.

Join me!", "I might be moving to USA from india and I want to understand insurance coverage. So I am a severe hemophilia type A case and I wanted some advice of how much a factor dose would cost for me. I take about 1500 units at a single time, 3 times a week on prophylaxis. \nNow in India I get the price of about 10 cents per unit. \nAlso the reason I am moving is that I might get a medical residency in USA. \nSo would you suggest some insurance plan? Or would you suggest not moving to USA? Which state? Because it can vary pretty wildly what your options will be.\n\nYour best option is to reach out to the hemophilia foundation specific to the state you are looking to live in. They will have the best information on options and support available to you.  Many people in the US get their health insurance through their employer.  If you get a medical residency you should ask whether health insurance is part of the benefits package that is offered to employees.  Employers may pay some or all of the monthly insurance premium.  Getting your health insurance through your employer's group plan is usually less expensive than an individual plan you would find on your own. &gt;Or would you suggest not moving to USA?\n\nThe US is a big place, depends on where you are planning on doing your residency.\n\nI will say that nobody in the US thinks of it as how much a dose costs - it is about your monthly premiums/copay/etc. You should absolutely talk to the local NHF/HFA chapter for wherever you are planning on moving to. You will be offered insurance through the school you are doing your residency through. If you are looking at options still, see if the university hospital you are considering has a Hemophilia Treatment Center affiliated with it, many do. The insurance your school offers will cover it (employees = patients, hey). \n\nFor factor you may have a copay, but most of the drug companies have co-pay assistance programs. What they pay will sometimes cover your whole deductible, but this really depends on the insurance. Your HTC can help with this. \n\nGo here to find the HTC closest to where you are looking to move. Once you are sure you are moving give them a call to establish care. ( \n\nSource: I work at an HTC.  Okay so this is something I have to research before applying for the programme. But my general question is whether the process of obtaining a single dose through an insurance is difficult? \nAnd thank you for the advice  Thank you so much... Here is a site you might find useful: ( \n\nAs far as obtaining a single dose when you need it: Whatever insurance plan you end up with will have one or more specialty pharmacies in their provider network from which you will get your medication.  In my experience the pharmacy will send you enough prophy doses to last for a month.  You will not have to go to them every time you need a single dose.\n\nMaybe you can even switch to ( and end up needing only one subq dose per month. Why a single dose? Normally your physician with write a prescription, and you would get, let us say, a month's worth of the product. \n\nOne you have insurance in place, getting the product is usually not an issue, unless that insurance company does not cover your specific product. \n\nEvery state is different, and every insurer is different.

Basically any kind of information will be helpfull.   \n\n\nThank you! Someone else ( a similar question recently.\n\nYour questions are not easy ones to answer.  A lot depends on what state you live in, your employment situation and your income.  Many people in the US get health insurance through their employer who may subsidize part of the cost. How about if you are unemployed, or work some minimum wage job? Does the state still take care of you, like in Western Europe? I can only speak to California, but they have GHPP. Which if you make under a certain income it is free, over a certain income you have to pay a fee. They were pretty good about providing prophy and anything needed. Sometimes a hassle to get them to pay promptly, but they always paid. Insured through employer now and have not had any issues. There are health insurance programs for the unemployed or those with incomes under certain thresholds.  There are health insurance programs for children below certain incomes.  There is a way for workers to purchase private health insurance if it is not provided by their employer.  Many of the previously mentioned programs are federally funded but administered by the states.  So the details can vary from state to state.\n\nI am not well-versed in how things work in Western Europe.  Health care is not a right in the United States.  A person who earns a low income or has no income may find it difficult to cobble together health care coverage.  It may be doable but it probably will not be easy and it may always be precarious.  It is easy for people to fall through the cracks in our \"system\" and they do.  And keep in mind that many government programs may not be available to all immigrants.\n\nAlso, see my comment ( Yeah, CA is the easiest state by far.\n\nAnd by easiest what I mean is the only one  with a safety net. Michigan also has a safety net i ma gucci cuh May I ask, what type of insurance you chose from your employer which is hassle-free? I have to decide on insurance for my new job (HDDP + employer funded HSA with no monthly cost or PPO with monthly fee) and I am worried about how it will cover factor and HTTC visits.  I am mild hemophilia b, so I rarely need treatment, but when I do it is usually an emergency, so I am hoping to figure out the best insurance  before I have any issues. Completely hassle free is a luxury I do not think we will ever have.  But I go with a high deductible PPO plan so that I can choose my health providers. Since I am severe Hemophilia A I am constantly dealing with getting factor ordered, etc. Usually reach my max out of pocket early in the year and good to go for the rest of the year. Plus high deductible gives me access to HSA which is nice. Also, do not forget if going the high deductible route - most medicine companies have copay assistance. So keep that in mind when choosing/shopping around. &gt;Completely hassle free is a luxury I do not think we will ever have.\n\nVery true., I am just hoping I can make it through this change in insurance without any insane unexpected medical bills.\n\nI am leaning towards high deductible since the HSA will be mostly funded by my employer anyway. My HTTC told me to contact the insurance to verify that they were 'in network', so hopefully that can help figure it out.   \n\nThanks for your input!", "Do you know other hemophiliacs in real life?

Lots of room for different contact numbers and info. Especially if you are on Hemlibra, you need to specify you cannot have FEIBA, which is used in emergencies. I used American Medical ID. I would have used road ID because I used them before but they did not have anything I was interested in. I just wanted a bracelet that looked plain and boring and is easily identifiable as a medical bracelet without even looking close.

With that being said i never did swimming and i did indeed go to the gym and even played tennis. So i have a couple pieces of advice for that in case you decide to go.\n\n1) You need to make sure to inform the people there about your bleeding disorder and week joints so that they build a workout routine that is safer for you with the appropriate amounts of weights.\n\n2) If you see that even though you are careful, you still get bleeds, then you should probably stop. \n\nTrust me it is better to give it up than continue having bleeds because in a few years they might become a bit of an issue. See i never had bleeds anywhere else except from my right ankle. Still to this day i lift dumbbells in my room without an issue. But i wish i stopped doing anything involving my right ankle since let us say the age of 10. Had i been more careful and did not play tennis, basketball etc. i probably would not have to have a surgery in a month.\n\nSo whatever you do to workout just remember that your ultimate goal is to not get bleeds at all. Also, it is very important indeed for you to lose fat. It is vital for us hemophiliacs because of plenty of reasons.\n\n1) You have better veins in your arms to inject and they will be vital for when you start injecting yourself if you do not already do.\n\n2) In case of an injury, it is best for you to be light enough so that you can move around easier using crutches, or in my case with the surgery it helps being light so that doctors and nurses and your parents can carry you and move you around more easily.\n\n3) Extra weight is not good for your ankles in general. The less weight they bear, the better.\n\nSo in conclusion, do find a way to exercise and lose weight but be very careful and seek advice from your doctors. Two words my guy as another hemophilia a severe. Low impact, look into things like tai chi really solid work out and should not cause bleeds as long as you pay attention to your bodies limits. Cycling is a low impact sport I would recommend. Here is my thoughts:\n\n- Most people without an underlying medical condition have a hard time losing weight. It is a complex issue, and having Haemophilia certainly adds to the complexity. It is important to recognise that it is a difficult task, and extra challenging with Haemophilia.\n\n- Like building any habit, small steps and small wins are often key to making it stick. Having a bleed while you are building the habit will disrupt forming that habit, making it harder for you than someone without Haemophilia. I would avoid weights and focus on strengthening your joints with stretches and low impact cardio, to lower the chance you get a bleed.\n\n- Have a look at your diet. Are there any obvious places where making a change would have a significant impact? Depending on how much weight you have to lose, you can make a HUGE difference with changes to your diet alone. Personally I have found swapping out bad food for a healthier version works for me. Do you drink a lot of fizzy drinks? Swap it with sparkling water. How about chocolate? Try dark chocolate 70% or greater. If you are still living at home, ask your parents to help you by not stocking your house with sugary snacks.\n\n- You are already noticing some issues with your ankles. As someone who is now in their 30s and is having more and more issues with my ankles, you are on the same trajectory as me. This is not one of those things that happens to other people like I thought when I was your age. Let me tell you that your ankles do not get better with age, they get worse. Sure there are some procedures that can be done to alleviate symptoms to a certain extent, but ask anyone suffering from arthritis in their ankles and they will often have regrets about having not done more to protect their ankles in their younger years. Reducing the pressure on your ankles really helps to give you more time, and weight is a huge factor. Comfortable shoes helped me a lot, so I would highly recommend investing in good shoes.\n\nPLEASE MAKE A CHANGE.\n\nYou are not a different person in the future. You are still you. The choices you make now will have a massive impact on your quality of life in the future.\n\nThe fact that you are asking these sorts of your questions gives me hope that you already recognise that you need to look after yourself.\n\nYou can do it :) Low impact workouts (swimming, etc.) and diet change. You will be fine.  If your gym has a stationary bike, I highly recommend that! Severe A here. Swimming regularly never caused me a bleed and it will get you in great shape if you keep at it. Then once you are stronger, you will be able to start lifting if you still want more. Are you in the United States, and if so, do you go to a hemophilia treatment center (HTC)? \n\nIf so, then ask them! It is their job to help you out with this sort of thing. The physical therapists at my HTCs have always been extremely helpful with recommendations re: general physical wellness / fitness. as mentioned, to lose fat is to consume fewer calories than you are able to spend.  \nJust watch your diet.  \nAs for training, from my experience (35 years old, severe hemophilia A), I recommend adhering to the rules:  \n1. Use a factor preparation before every workout.  \n2. If you feel pain in the joint, give up this exercise, you make it worse.  \n3. If you are bleeding, stop until full recovery, find your mistake and never repeat it.  \nps exercise is just as important in hemophilia as it is dangerous. I wish you find a good coach. Thanks a lot bro! It indeed did give me an idea of how I can go on with it :) I do cycle, but sometimes when the ride duration gets longer, I get a groin bleed, rarely, but yes. Also lol, I am going to get factor rn. No my guy, I do not live in the US, I live in India, but there are 'Haemophilia Societies' here, which have the same concept, just named differently, the thing is, in my society, there really is no one educated about this particular issue. Uk my guy, I have thought that, when I move out, I will get a personal trainer who is educated about Hemophilia, my parents get really paranoid whenever I try to do something, which is again, not wrong but it annoys me. Like I am soo good at tennis and badminton, but I cannot play it regularly. Basketball is another sport that I am good at :). But guys.. what if you inject and workout on same day? That should be fine right? Im 39 i inject 2/week./ Jivi 4000 IE. According to my doctor, lifting weights is just fine. My guy, the thing is, that I do not have that much factor readily available at me at all times, like there is the factor that we ourselves have bought, which is around 2k units according to my body weight, but the nearest 'HTC' as you all call it is about 40 mins away from me. And travelling that much without any means, except for me asking my dad, \ud83d\ude2c it will not work out in the long run... Like 4 days a week 40 mins travel.. Sheesh \n\nPs. My parents are not even fine with me working out, they are soo paranoid that I will get sever bleeds, so there is like 0 help I can get from their side. Brah.. sorry to say. But i will not fuck with weights if im not on Factor at least 10%. If you already got some bad joints it will definitely give you bleedings. I only lift when im on Factor /  twice a week. \n\nSwimming or biking may also give you bleeding if you are &lt; 1% of course its still much more safe that weights. You are 17 and you have TONS of time to get your stuff together and learn from us oldies.\n\nLow impact cardio - swimming is a great one.   Riding a bike is also great.   Walking is always good, as long as there is no hip or below things going on.", "Hemophiliac Conference Hello fellow hemophiliacs, I am 32 years old and from the southern United states and have severe hemophilia type A.

The resources that we currently have for the event are limited, but we should be good for 14 more users. Server resources are limited and have not been tested at full capacity. Video and voice will be available. If you do not have good internet speed, you can still call in and be apart of the conversation, but international calling charges may apply. Anyone inside the US can call in no problem, I still have to figure out the international calling stuff. \n\nIf this works out and people join, we may make it a more regular and bigger thing.

I hope to hear form some of you soon, and look forward to hearing from others with some of the same issues as me. We can all help each other, and I hope that this helps a few see that they are not alone and there are people who still care and can help them when times get hard.

In any case, as a European, I will be asleep by then and will not be able to join. Hopefully there is a next time where all the kinks would be worked out. Best of luck! Uhhh if you need people to actually call in on their phones, I am not sure your system is as easy as \"everyone loads up Hangouts.\"\n\nPlus you left no time for anyone to really prepare, so there is that to consider in the future.

Please do not take this wrong way because I am only giving you my honest response as some on who was supposed to be 3x a week for a long time and just kept skipping it all the time. \n\nThere was never really any emotional/mental stuff going on when I got a bleed. Just a \"damn it... ugh. Gota treat\" That was the extent of it. Not exactly sure what else you would be referring to? I am so thankful you are being honest because I would rather have the real, true picture. I have read so much about it and it seems like everyone is experiences are different. Or maybe they are not? \nI was just wondering if after you infuse, how much uncertainty does someone feel while recovering? Like do you know how long it will take to feel better? Do you know if you will be okay 2 or 3 days after a bleed? Or what activities you should probably do or not do? Or do you just get on with life? Or is there always somewhere in the back of your mind, some little uncertainty about the next time a bleed happens and how that recovery will be? \nI really appreciate your honesty! I always try to learn through people's experiences so thank you. Why are you asking? 9.5/10 bleeds are solved with 1 dose for me, Type A Severe. I never really worry about whether or not itll come back. I just know by the severity of the bleed and the location, what the outcome will be. \nFinger joint bleed - couple hours to like 12 hours with residual swelling.\nElbow bleed couple hours for the majority of the pain, 1-2 of additional slight soreness. \n\nHip bleed - same as elbow, maybe a smidge longer.\n\nOver my 28 years with it, literally nothing bothers me emotionally or stresses me out about my hemophilia.

Hi everyone, i hope you are all safe and happy.\n\nMy name is Nick, i am 21 years old from Greece and i have haemophilia type A - severe (&lt;1%).  \nSo a few months back i started feeling some pain in the right foot area while walking. Also occasionally my foot would sort of \"lock\" and cause a lot of pain. I got a Magnetic resonance imaging and as it turns out i have a \"bubble\" right above the talus (Sorry i do not know the english word), which has also caused some damage on the top of the talus itself. So what caused it is that as a teenager i had a lot of injuries on my right foot and then i had some automatic bleeds there as well. 2 weeks ago, i got a PRP injection but it did not help and today the doctors said that i should have a surgery in about a month from now and they will have to put some implant in there which they will possibly have to get from somewhere in the lower back area of my body.  \nWell this whole thing kind of sucks because i am getting vaccinated soon and i was making plans to go on vacation on a greek island in a few weeks with my friends that i have not seen in a long time because of covid. Also i was going to rent an apartment in the city i study in and i was looking forward to go back to university because they will probably operate again next semester. I was so excited to see my teachers and classmates. Well, today it feels like life punched me in the gut and all those plans now seem to blur away.\n\nNow the reason why i am making this post is that i just wanted to reach out to this subreddit and ask for information about some stuff because i figured there might be some people here who had the same problem or know someone who did.  \nSo feel free to give me any advice on the following:\n\nHow long after the surgery will i have to stay in bed before i can walk safely?  \nDuring the healing period do i have to be in bed for the while time? Or will i be able to uses crutches to let us say go to the bathroom so this would mean occasionally touching the floor with my foot?\n\nCan i sit in a chair during the healing period?\n\nIs there going to be a bump in my back or something from the thing they will dig out? Will it hurt?\n\nAnd you know any other general information you might have for this such as whether it is going to hurt after the surgery or if i have to go back and get any stiches removed. Also stuff like how do you take showers when you are in a situation like that?\n\nAnyway thanks in advance for any advice you might have for me. It would mean a lot.  \nAnd one last thing. In case no one told you today just know that you deserve to be loved and you matter. Hi Nick! I have angiohemophilia/vwd so obviously I am not able to fully relate (my inability to clot is only moderate severity on the grand scale of hemophiliacs), but I actually got told today that I am going to need surgery for something really similar on my left wrist/hand, also likely due to joint damage from my heme situation. I have not had an in-depth conversation with my hematology team yet (I will happily update you if I do and there is anything important I think could help you), but you should definitely be checking with your hematologists as well based on your specific case. Here are a few things I will say now:\n\n\\-Sometimes (at least in the US) they will do surgeries like this in outpatient facilities where they exclusively do orthopedics. If this is the case, get them to do it in an actual hospital instead, where they have everything necessary in case something goes wrong.\n\n\\-They may give you dissolvable stitches, in which case you probably will not have to go back in because your body will just heal and absorb them. If not, they will give you the regular plastic ones, which you will have to go back to get removed. If that is the case, it is not that big a deal but definitely infuse beforehand just to be safe.\n\n\\-It will probably hurt some, ask your doctors and hematologists if it is too much to deal with. As you probably know, lots of the pain medications that \"work best\" can mess with blood clotting, but I was once put on one called Celebrex that they said did not interfere with clotting as much. It worked quite well, though it lowered my appetite as a side effect.\n\n\\-If you have access to a bathtub, taking baths might be easier than taking showers. If not, I would suggest you get a shower stool or chair so you can comfortably sit in the shower, seeing as it is on your foot- we do not want you slipping! Any dressings should not be gotten wet, so take them off before bathing, but generally stitches/closed surgical sites are allowed to get wet after 48 hours. It should not be soaked/submerged in water for any significant period of time while you still have the stitches in, so if you take a bath keep your foot lifted out of it and wash that area separately, but getting it wet in the shower is perfectly fine.\n\nI have not had surgery on my feet or legs, so I do not think I can really answer your other questions well. Sorry, I hope what I have said helps.\n\nI totally understand feeling like your medical issues are getting in the way of your life and studies- I do not have a solution, but perhaps you will find some comfort in knowing others have felt that way too. It sucks, and I am sorry you have to deal with it.\n\nBy the way, your English is fantastic! I took four years of French classes and still only knew just enough to get by pre-pandemic when we could still go to Quebec. I can always count on the Europeans to make me feel a bit inferior! Lmao\n\nBest of luck with your surgery, sending love from the states :) Hello, thanks a lot for your reply. It really means a lot to me.\n\nI will have the surgery in a hospital in Athens sometime in August. I cannot lie to you i am scared of the surgery. I have not had any surgery in the past. As a hemophiliac i only ever suffered from right foot injuries up until now that they actually came back to haunt me.\n\nI know that in a few months that will be all in the past and i will remember it as something that only made me stronger as a person. But right now it really hit me you know?  \nAll i do ever since they told me about the surgery is to sit in my chair and watch Friends all day. (I get the humor and i love it. Most Europeans that say they do not get it is probably because of the bad translations on Netflix and them not speaking English good enough).\n\nI know that i still have more than a month before the surgery and i have to become productive, so i guess that is another challenge there for me. Deal with it psychologically.\n\nAbout foreign languages which i love as a topic. I think the most difficult thing for English speakers is to learn languages that every object has a gender because in English the objects are neutral. I can relate to you in a way because a few years back i learned some Russian and i had to learn the genders and objects by heart.\n\nAlso i always dreamed of living abroad but as a hemophiliac it is probably better to live in my country. But i want to travel a lot in the world in few years when i finish university with the US and Canada being my main priorities. I would love to visit NYC, Chicago, LA, Montreal and many others.\n\nAgain, thanks a lot for your advice it gave me a good overlook on how i have to do certain things. I wish you a good luck with your surgery and i would love for you to get back to me with an update on how it went. Sending you love back all the way from the Mediterranean. I think \"bubble\" = \"cyst\" (edit: or maybe bursitis)\n\nI have one as well in my ankle. Actually had a synovectomy and removed some bone spurs in that ankle, but the cyst was too much in the middle of the join for my surgeon to safely get at.\n\nI had a ton of ankle bleeds as a kid, and was terrible at trying to stick to a schedule. I think growing up with a lot of snow was also bad, since I would be walking on uneven packed snow a large part of the year instead of smooth sidewalks/roads.\n\nI had that ankle surgery when I was 21 as well. I did not have to stay in bed, but I did have to use crutches and cast, followed by a big air compression boot.\n\nIt is kind of a fine line when trying to get a joint to recover. You do not want to overwork it and cause lasting damage, and you do not want to completely baby it and have your muscles atrophy.\n\nYou should be able to sit in a chair, but laying down will be advised in the first few weeks so that your ankle is above your heart, which improves circulation.\n\nFor showers, you can usually just wrap your ankle/leg in a plastic bag / trash bag. The hospital might have some more sophisticated things for you. I would advise picking up a plastic or teak wood stool for your shower, if there is not a place to sit already.\n\nThey will probably be able to do this surgery just with scope holes. So several small incisions around the joint, instead of one large incisions with a lot of stitches. This makes it much easier to clean and care for the wounds, and heals much quicker.\n\nedit: I should add what a synovectomy is, think it seems like they should be trying to do that at the same time as removing the \"bubble\". When you have repetitive joint damage, a form of scar tissue builds up. Eventually, there is so much of this \"scar tissue\" that even normal movement of the joint can scrape against it and provoke a bleed. A Synovectomy goes in and removes some of this build up to give your joint more room to move. I have had this done on both my L Ankle and R Elbow. My Elbow was so bad that they took off part of the head of a bone to give the joint more room. Repetitive joint bleeds also destroys the cartilage in your joints, so ankle fusions are often inevitable since you cannot fully restore the joint. My ankle pain is not too bad, so I have been avoiding fusions because it takes like 6months to recover from that and is very painful at the beginning. There are some alternatives to fusions being done in a few places, might see them grow in prevalence in the next decade. Hello and thanks a lot for commenting on my post,\n\nYeah a cyst is what i have and i hope that they will be able to get it out. When i was at the hospital a couple of days ago when they informed me about the surgery, the doctor briefly told me what they need to do (Without too much information. I think the doctors try to seem cool about it in front of you or something to not scare you i guess), and he swept his finger across my foot showing me the incision and he made a line of like 7-8 cm roughly.\n\nSo i do not know if this gives out any information but i think it probably means he is going to make a large incision.\n\nI am not going to lie to you i do not care at all about the pain neither on my foot nor in my back.  \nNo matter the pain i can take it. What i mostly care about is how am i going to be able to let us say use the toilet when they send me back home. I just hope they do not send me away only a few days after the surgery. I would rather stay in there for a few weeks. And then when they send me home i can at least take care of myself to some extend.\n\nBut unfortunately i do not think my case is going to be like yours. I think i will have to stay in bed for at least 6-8 weeks. Which for the record means that i will fall back on a lot of things in my life and it will be a pain in the neck to get back to them.\n\nAnyway thanks a lot for reaching out, you gave a lot of very useful information. Hi again Nick! I am back to update you :)\n\nI had my surgery yesterday with very little trouble. A couple weeks ago I met with my hematology team to get a plan together in advance, but based on how minor it was, they were not all that concerned.\n\nYesterday, I went to my base hospital (where my heme team is) for my infusion, then my mother drove me the about ten minutes to the second hospital, where my surgery was taking place. They left my IV in from my infusion, which was convenient because is meant I did not need to be stuck twice. \n\nThe surgeon said that the procedure went really well, and I did not bleed much all things considered. As I just wrote, my hematologists were not all that worried either- in fact they were not really focused on the surgery at all, their only major concern was post-operation internal bleeding, but they said that was unlikely and I have not had any of note. They just told me to keep an eye on it for a few days and come back in for another infusion if that were to happen.\n\nThey bandaged up my wrist in a sort of temporary cast, but I get it off next Wednesday morning and then I get to switch to much slimmer bandages over the stitches and a brace for my wrist. Right now, I have to keep it elevated and cannot get it wet. Showering was an interesting experience, but I made it through! Generally though, I am back to being pretty normal. Obviously there are some issues with using that hand, so my sister had to pull up my hair for me this morning and my little brother is starting to get a touch annoyed with me interrupting his video games to get him to open something for me, but it is nothing too bad.\n\nI hope your procedure goes just as well as mine did, and fingers crossed (at least on the hand I can cross my fingers on right now lol) that both of us have quick and smooth recoveries! Hello again,\n\nI am very happy for you that everything went well and thanks a lot for remembering to get back to me and let me know about how it went.  \nI have not had my surgery yet because there are not available beds in the hospital currently. On Monday i am to call the hospital again to get an update on when i can go and have the surgery or call them again in a couple of weeks. At this point i do not really know when am i going to have it. \n\nThe bad thing for me is that the later i have the surgery, the later i will be able to get back to my normal life (university for the most part), and this makes me really anxious and worried. It is this uncertainty that makes you go crazy. And all of that is because the surgery is going to be on my right foot talus. As far as i know i will have to not weight bear for at least 2 months which is a bummer.\n\nI have planned a few things to keep myself occupied while recovering. I have a lot of books to read, a lot of courses to study for, an Arduino, Netflix, video games etc.  \nSo after all it is not going to be as easy for me both the surgery and the recovery but what can you do. I am not being ungrateful. I am aware that there are worse situations.\n\nWe are very lucky that we have people in our lives to take care of us and that is the most important thing. Hang in there and you will feel better day by day.

Talk to your social worker and nurse, have them speak to your Medicare insurance provider and explain your procedure.  \n\nMedicare might have to speak Cvs if they are not approving factor.

I appreciate it and all those who responded here. I will let everyone know what happens. Most factor company\u2019s have a factor copay assistance grant. It is super easy to sign up for and the manufacturer of humate-P will pay something like $12,000 towards your insurance deductible. Just google Humate-P copay, then fill out the form or call them. I hope this helps. Medicare patients are not eligible for the vast majority of these co-pay assistance programs, typically only patients with commercial insurance can utilize them. That is true sometimes. But I have a friend on Medicare who was still able to get a grant , it just took signing up and being denied I think, then they went to the next option. But I am sure he was able to get $12,000 to pay his copay, and he is on Medicare. He got his grant through the PAN foundation. \nYou can apply at  Yes, that is a separate thing though. Medicare patients can benefit from assistance funds and foundations and the like, its specifically the manufacturer copay assistance programs that do not work with federal and state insurances. This is due to anti-kickback laws that make it illegal for drug manufacturers to provide payment for the patients. Try applying for this grant at  Thanks for this - worth a try! Thank you - I will give it a try though. I will try anything! Thank you!

I had three hernia repairs, robotic and laparoscopic. I stayed in Albany Med for four days following surgery and had Humate-P every 12 hours. No problems. Everyone was terrific.

I took my 3rd week dose yesterday And as  severe hemophilia A patients with inhibitors  . i just want to share my story\n\n1st ly i am 21 year old student from India who is now is in his last year of computer engineering course.  so i think i am fairly educated. up until 2012 in my state in india which is Maharashtra factor VIII and FEIBA were not provided by government so we have buy them from market and to remind everyone from out of the  india medical insurance is not that popular in india. so i will rarely take factor VII till 2008 because of it is value\n\non October 2008 i took nasty fall from my high-school stares and my left knee was so damaged that i was on wheelchair for 3 months. there it was detected that i have inhibitors so i have take FEIBA but it is cost is astronomical 500 unit of FEIBA cost around 50,000 rupees which is around 700 dollars. for a normal bleed i have to take around 3000 units of FEIBA  for that you all can calculate the cost . i come from a upper middle class family so i cannot afford to FEIBA even every 6 months prophylaxis was very long shot\n\nFrom 2012 government of India and my state government started providing free factors and FEIBA in government owned hospital. since then  situation much improved much more .in 2014 i got Brain bleed which was subdural brain hemorrhage it happened due to over exposure to heat ( not a Trauma or accident injury just i walked for too long for 3-4 days on heated days) it got cured after doses of 5000 unit of FEIBA  every 12 hours for 10 days (mind you that it was free due to government)  \n\nnow conditions are much more improved in India in many hospitals free prophylaxis started for patients below 8 year old\n\nDue to well educated parents and good doctors i have manged mostly all of my bleeds with ice and rest since last 20 years. i am doing cycling,swimming and regular physiotherapy since i am 8 years old. due which i am one of few 18+ year old patient whose joints are fairly good . In India it is very  common to have a very deformed joint for a hemophilia paietent\n\nI am one 6 lucky hemophilia A with inhibitors patients  who got selected for hemlibra trial for 2 years. and yesterday after my 3rd dose my clinical trail doctor told me that i can increase my physical activities. which was one of best line i heard in my life. because due to hemophilia i was never able to play any outdoor sport or any outdoor activities ,do not get me wrong i was good at indoor games such as chess ,etc. i was top of my class in studies even now in university i published 4\n\nresearch papers in various engineering research journals. now i am planning to further my study in astronomy and computer science by doing a PhD which is doctorate degree  so i was enjoying my indoor life but there was part missing every time when is used watch friends play cricket, football or plan a trek  i was just able to watch\n\nbut since trail began i think i can live a normal life even it is for two years \n\nThank you all for reading my useless rant about my life (i shared it here because i think only hemophilia patient can understand it)\n\nagain THANK YOU \n\n  Congratulations!\n\nMy \"levels\" were not up to full until the 4th or so dose? If you are on a similar trial schedule they will reduce your dosage around week 4 or 6 (I honestly cannot remember and not sure where my trial paperwork is).\n\nEnjoy your newfound freedom but do remember that it will take time for you to figure out your body's new limits and *you can still get bleeds on Hemlibra!* I recently did my ankle in just by taking a step weirdly, but ice &amp; rest fixed it relatively quickly.\n\nTake it slow-ish for the first few weeks, maybe wait a few months until you take up skateboarding, and do not hesitate to contact your coordinator if anything weird happens. Congratulations! Stories like this always remind me how lucky I am in the UK with free factor prophylaxis. I hope this new treatment serves you well.  Get raped fag Congrats for getting hemlines trial bro...I can understand what you are talking about as I am brother of severe  haemophilic patient with Inhibitor..Last month we found that he is inhibitor to factor 8 when he is injured himself with psaous bleeding in right leg and got treatment in KEM hospital in mumbai but they told us to provide feiba from next time as they having some availability issues so they just warned us before only..He is still not well but taking rest at home with some exercise of physio.\nNow since thn we are searching for hemlibra  trail  program I assume it is too late for that..\nWill be glad if you provide some information about inhibitor and hemlibra trail you got we are from Daman which is 140kms from Mumbai..What Is the procedure to get this trials?? That is great, SargentV. When will they complete the clinical trials and Hemlibra becomes available for regular prophylactic treatment in India ? the cost of hemlibra is very high in India above 4 core rs. so i do not think most of patients able to offered it. my trial will complete in late 2020. but our doctor is talk with roche for extending trial. and i hope they will agree to it Thanks for sharing your experience. Is they started hemlibra to hemophilia A without inhibitor  not yet\n", "Hemophilia C Hey, does anyone have this type of Hemophilia? I recently got diagnosed", "Covid Hello, sevA, not super sure but might have Covid, i have tested the day before and was negative...in case it happens, any advice? Call your doctor. Be vaccinated. Vitamins and rest, Tylenol can help a little bit if you end up with a fever / pain. If you feel like you need to then go to the hospital. That is it. No specific risk factors for Hemophiliacs, just make sure your doctor knows.\n\niirc, the biggest concern at the start of this was supply chain issues. Call your doctor ofc, but some things you can do is take zinc and vitamin D. so the process is normal? just like in an ordinary person?", "Strange question for people. So I was having a thought the other day. Admittedly due to Medical Marijuana for pain management but still a thought. \n\nI noticed that my pinky toes bend at a 90\u00b0 and can lay their sides on the ground. For lack of me putting a picture of my feet on the post just imagine the nail of my pinky toe comes to a rest looking left on my left foot and right on the right. My theory on how this might have happened is when you have got an ankle bleed and you walk on the sides of your feet to take pressure off in anyway you can my toes adjusting for balance just got used to resting that way. \n\nSo my question to you is, do other hemophiliacs have other little quirks like this that you formed from a life time of coping with bleeds and such? And if so what are they? I am not sure if this would be a quirk exactly, but whenever I get a decent nosebleed I usually weep a little blood.\n\nI noticed it back when I was a child and absolutely creeped the shit out of my mum, it started when I had a very bad nosebleed which we thought had eventually stopped after several hours (obvious rookie mistake at this point looking back), but it was late and I was an exhausted child so I went to bed.\n\nI slept fine though the night but when I woke up the next day I fell stupidly nauseous, ultimately ended up vomiting a good couple pints of blood. So trip to A&amp;E for me! Turned out the nosebleed had stopped...but stopped coming out my nose and still continued to bleed down my throat into my stomach.\n\nWas in hospital for a few days with a pack up my nose to absorb the bleeding and get it to stop, with the blood backing up my nasal passage it ended up coming out my eyes.\n\nKept telling my mum I was possessed \ud83d\ude01 I am 52 with severe Hemophilia B, I have had so many bleeds in my right elbow that my arm does not straighten any more. And fingers will go numb and I drop things. I have had 3 surgeries on that elbow. My left elbow is the same; the sleeves on my professional clothes all have to be tailored, since that elbow cannot straighten fully.\n\nAlong the lines of OP, I also find that my shoes wear in predictable patterns that are different per foot; I walk more on the outside of one foot and the inside of the other. Now that you mentioned it, my left foot gets calluses that crack on the heel and I have had several bleeds in that ankle. I never even put that together I have not had and ankle bleed in years. Have any of you passed blood in your urine? I had a kidney bleed and I when I peed it was bright red. Then I treated it and passed a blot clot that put me in the ER.  For several years after that I peed blood off and on. HTC told me not to treat, drink a gallon of water throughout the day when it happened to dilute it. It worked. Crazy. I peed blood on the same month two years in a row... I was given liquids to drink and through IV.... And my HTC also dose me up with factor..... They did tests and stuff but never told me where the source of the bleeding was... Have not noticed blood since the last time.... Yup same problem.  Have to be careful when if sitting not to rest my elbow on the couch or my arm goes numb.  3 surgeries as well.  I now have some neuropathy on the top part of my arm from my elbow to my wrist.  In tingles if touched.  Also cannot touch my toes with my left arm. My ankles are pretty bad so I mostly get my flexion from the small joints in the foot.  I walk alot of my toes for going up hills or stairs.  My shoes after a few months can bend almost in as I have broken the soles in two.  I tend to buy alot of shoes so much that I will buy 2 or 3 pairs if I find some I like. Yup blood in pee.  A bit freaky when it happens. Got checked out by a urologist who said it was just a weird hemo thing.  Blood in semen before as well but that can also be common for men in general. Yes when I see a chair with wooden armrests it makes me queazy, I know it is going to hurt to rest my arm there. I like armless chairs and booth seats in restaurants. Just curious, because I have similar issues, what kind of surgeries have you had?  My elbow does not flex all of the way in either direction either, the joint is noticeably deformed, and I lose sensation in the last three digits when I have a bleed in that joint.  I was told they could not operate on it because the ulnar nerve runs through the elbow, and the risk of damaging that nerve was very good, and if it were to get damaged I may lose all function of my hand ('claw hand').  \n\nBTW, congrats on being a 52 year old Hemophiliac.  I am not trying to imply that you are an ancient person (I am late 40s) but the odds were not in your favor and it always makes my day to hear from older Hemophiliacs.", "Ibuprofen Hemophilia B Severe So this is just a curiosity question my medic alert band says my allergies are ibuprofen and aspirin but I know taking one pill of ibuprofen will not really do anything but how much would it take for something to actually happen to me? Could it be deadly? And what would happen? Ibuprofen slows down your blood's clotting time, so for pain relief you are better off using acetaminophen (Tylenol). Aspirin and ibuprofen are not really allergies more just contra-indicated.\n\nAspirin has anti clotting properties whjcb is why they recommend it for people at risk for cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks. It can also cause GI bleeding. \n\nIbuprofen is a cox inhibitor. It can be really hard on your stomach and cause GI bleeding.  This why it can be dangerous for Hemophiliacs. That is not to say you cannot take it.  When i was younger I remember getting prescriptions for ibuprofen from my hematologist.  I do not take it it anymore as I take Celebrex which is specifically a Cox 2 inhibitor which still reduces inflammation but is less likely to cause GI bleeding.\n\nHow much is safe for you to take is hard to say.  Non Hemophiliacs are prone to these side effects and hemophiliacs even more.  Likely taken one pill is not going to do anything but I would talk to your hematologist as there may be better alternatives.  It really is about the risk-benefit profile. You also have to be wary yourself. I have had doctors in the haematoloy ward prescribe medications with the active ingredient from aspirin before but fortunately it was caught by the nurse at the HTC when I went back for review after discharge. That is probably because those doctors specialise in the other branches that are not related to haemophilia but are the ones doing the ward rounds. I have a friend who popped them like candy... long story short, ended up with a brain bleed.... Oh my... Is your friend ok?? Yes this was years ago and, needless to say, only Tylenol now.... Just use any paracetamol instead.\n\nEveryone using the T-word, stop doing so. You are doing free marketing for a specific brand. You should be getting paid for saying that but you are not, do not let yourself be abused. Use the name for the active compound instead. In the US/Canada we usually use acetaminophen as the generic name for Tylenol.", "Sangamo Announces U.K. Authorization Of Clinical Trial Evaluating Zinc Finger Nuclease In Vivo Genome Editing Treatment For Hemophilia B ", "Do you guys use anti-depressants?  I read that drugs with the highest degree of serotonin reuptake inhibition - fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline - are more frequently associated with abnormal bleeding and modifications of hemostasis markers. So I wonder you guys use any anti-depressants. If so, which one do you use? Thank you so much for your sincerity! VWD - i used sertraline for about 8 years, at one point 100mg/day - never made any difference to my bleeding/blood results. Pristiq. No issues with extra bleeding. Smoke weed every day, fat dabs keep the pain at bay I am on an SNRI, as I have read that SSRIs can cause more bleeding issues. I am on venlafaxine/effexor, 75 mg. I have noticed more bruising and bleeding, but minor. In my research, I found that SSRIs interact with anticoagulants, like warfarin, and antiplatelet drugs, like aspirin. This includes an increased risk of GI bleeding, and post operative bleeding. The relative risk of intracranial bleeding is increased, but the absolute risk is very low. SSRIs are known to cause platelet dysfunction. I think that is why my doctors all agreed on putting me on an SNRI, as my vWD has more mucosal bleeding than a hemophiliac.

First, it is individual in nature rather than state sponsored. The intended benefit of any eugenic intervention is individual/private welfare (the child to be, or family), rather than the welfare of the state as a whole. Second, it is premised on individual liberty, the freedom of parents to choose according to their own values and conceptions of the good life. The state does not mandate contraception, sterilization, prenatal testing, abortion or any other form of eugenic intervention. \n\nI want to include a couple of individuals with different inheritable diseases in my paper and have compiled a brief set of questions that i would like to ask. If anyone is interested please dm me! Seriously? Gtf out of here with this shit. It is beyond ignorant of you to post something like this here. You are in the wrong place and you are not welcome. I did not mean to offend at all i am not writing about condoning eugenics and it would be in my opinion unjust to write about a topic such as this without having a closer understanding of individuals that suffer from genetic illness and without including your standpoints. I apologize for having caused offense. Ok fair enough. It is not only an offensive topic for a lot of other obvious reasons, but when dealing with a genetic condition you hear all kinds of stupid ideas your whole life, there is no discussion of this nonsense that I would be willing to have beyond this. IMO, You will have to frame your request with more tact if you expect anyone to respond with anything other than contempt. Ive come to the same conclusion just now i could have really worded it better considering i have a whole chapter about the stigma of the subject included in my paper. once again i apologize What the actual shit is wrong with you. Wtf does eugenic intervention of an individual mean? Who is doing the intervention if it is not state sponsored?", "Just got diagnosed with VWD, now what?

HTC suggested he look into the new FVIIa product, Sevenfact which we would never heard about. Apparently it was recently approved in the US but is not widely known yet. I feel that new products offer options which is always a positive thing for bleeding disorder patients.\n\nWe came across a compelling video posted by a patient.\n\n(\n\nDosing is different than Novo and 84% of bleeds in the trial were stopped with just one dose.

I have been having major joint bleeds continuously for the last 3 months even though I have been on complete bed rest and factor every other day. I have been missing college since then and have not been able to concentrate on the studies at all. Has anything like this happened to you and how did you fight such a situation. \nWould really appreciate some help. I had a terrible ankle bleed that did not stop completely after a couple months and I finally had to switch to an older blood based version of factor VIII that had vonwillibrands factor already bonded to it (I was using a synthetic factor and I switched to Alphanate ) and the bleed finally stopped. Some people do not clot as well at all with the synthetic stuff. It is pretty common. It took a while to get back on my feet after being down for so long. I have some really good doctors and a lot of Hemo community support so I was able to get the best care possible. I would highly suggest looking into using a product with FVIII and VWF in it. Message me if you want me to point you in the right direction.  Hey mate, have you had a blood test at your HTC? Could be that you developed an inhibitor or something similar... Definitely speak to your haematologist about it, because you should not be having major continuous joint bleeds in your early 20s, especially with prophylaxis.\n\nFingers crossed that you get better mate. I was going to say that as well.  You need to switch products.  As others have stated, get tested for inhibitors and then plan of action.  Sorry you are going thru this Dude go get a blood test asap. That is not normal at all. I am sorry that must be terrible but bleeds should react right away to factor and rest. I have got my blood checked and I do not have an inhibitor. It is mostly related to my weight, I think. I am about 85 kgs, which is quite high. But it is like a bas cycle because if I try to lose weight I get more bleeds and if I do not my weight increases causing more bleeds.  Thank you for the help. I will definitely talk to my doctor about it. I will let you know if it helps. I have no inhibitor. I got it tested. But as I said in another reply my weight is the major problem. I have no inhibitor. I got it tested. But as I said in another reply my weight is the major problem. I have alot of weight on you, are you extremely short or something? That is not much weight, are you rather short? No I am about 5\u201911\u2019\u2019 Why did you switch to inches when your first weight given was kgs? Also something seems seriously wrong. Your body weight index is normal from the old school style of measuring. If exercising is not an option, you can always change your diet.\nAlso my Physical Therapist suggested biking and swimming for me,\ntry to find exercises that does not require much joint stress. I have a problem ankle that used to flare up about twice a month and pretty much benched me for a day or two.  I faced the same issue, I was a 'big guy' and could not exercise without causing further injury.  Then I realized that weight loss primarily happens in the kitchen.  I started a ( diet and lost around 130kg.  This was over five years ago and though the range of motion is not 100%, I have not had a bleed in that ankle since. Hey man, I have an amazing experience with losing weight. My ankles a some other parts have improved so much. I can really recommend swimming and exercise bands (instead of weights).  Are you calculating the dose based on that formula? How many per cent are you boosting yourself to every other day? Swimming and acqua aerobics.  Use the water to support your weight and provide resistance.  Once you get down, then move on to weight training (under the guidance of your HTC and physical therapist).  Build muscle tone around your weight bearing joints.  \n\nAlso, what is your trough level?  If you can keep it above 12-15%, you stand a pretty good chance of sealing up your bleeding sites.  Might talk with your HTC about that. It is about 7%. I am from india, the problem with the doses here is that the government does not provide us with them and when you try to buy them they are too expensive so the doctors prefer to give low doses and the body has become quite used to the low levels. Yeah, I am 6'2\" and 330lbs, and do not have issues like that. Yeah, I might get a bleed if I overexert or push myself too hard, but just being overweight does not cause it, my ankles, knee, and hip were even wrecked before I was in 4th grade. So they are super easy targets. \n\nThere is something else going on, get your levels checked again, mistakes happen. I literally had surgery once to remove my port bc the blood test said I had a staph infection in it. Lying in recovery a hospital rep approached me and said it had actually been a screwup by the lab. Screwups happen, ppl are human.\n\nAlso, some other great comments here about synthetic factors. There may be something damaged there too, x-ray, MRI, or ultrasound may help.\n\nIf your bleed is bad and it is not fully healed, and you are pushing it, it can easily retrigger. I know it is tough, but make sure you have ample time to heal. Thanks for the information. I was thinking of starting the keto diet, I am going to contact a dietician asap.  I am in india so the Segway will not be do not, neither will be allowed.\nI will try some new concentrate.\nBut I think that I have been almost unfocused on other aspects of my life due to the disease for some time.\nI need some help with that.\n Ahhh ok, well that sucks about the Segway. Hemophilia can be very tough mentally to deal with. I highly recommend joined some online support groups if one is not accessible near you.\n\nI am older so I have dealt with a lot of issues, and have a lot of experience, if you ever just need to talk feel free to message me. Sometimes it helps to just vent to ppl going through similar things. Sorry but have you had sudden weight gain?  Since it is weight based dosing, when was the last time you had you had a dose adjustment?  Have you been dosing higher since your breakthrough bleeds?   Sorry but have you had sudden weight gain?  Since it is weight based dosing, when was the last time you had you had a dose adjustment?  Have you been dosing higher since your breakthrough bleeds?   This. Swimming is really good as it does not use much in the joints and is more towards the muscles. I do not really see how that is an issue? I am 5'11\" and I weigh 195 lbs (88 kilos) and it has not been an issue for my joints. I also only get once per week Eloctate (switching to Hemlibra Tuesday). The only joint problem I have is with my elbow, but that was due to extended racing wheel use (for my Xbox) with improper form and thinking it was a muscle bleed and being stupid with not scheduling a treatment for it back when I was not taking factor each week. Instead I scheduled my treatment for the next day and it got worse pretty quickly.\n\nAlthough some things that have helped:\n\n- For my ankles, I wear Nike air shoes. Tight fit that do not allow me to twist my ankle easily and provide a lot of support.\n\n- For my knees, I make sure to walk as often as possible but not for too long. Take breaks.\n\n- Walking down stairs I always make sure to not turn wrong. I take my time on them and ensure not to twist my ankle or knee the wrong way. It is kind of become force of habit now to be self aware of it.\n\nWhile I am not happy with my weight yet (I want to be down to 170 lbs/77 kilos), I am down 25 lbs/11 kilos over the past 6 months which has helped a lot as well. My knees do not occasionally ache anymore. For me it was purely cutting out pop and sweets. I have not had any pop since May and that has helped tremendously along with cutting down on portions for meals. I had a rough time in college i had to quit school to get my knee replacement after a year i went back and finished school.. if your missing lots of class and know you cant get back on track .. forfit the semester before it hurts your gpa  You need any black market medicine? Maybe we can work out a deal. Oh yeah, the shipping would probably screw over any value, plus you are from a place that I am pretty sure has a much lower standard of living, so this exchange would only work the other way around. Hmph...", "What causes mild VWD to suddenly spiral out of control? I have Mild VWD. I get the depo shot to minimize menstrual bleeding and am prescribed Stimate. 2 weeks ago I started having worse than usual issues, had a nosebleed I struggled to stop, bruising and bleeding worse than when I was undiagnosed and was using aspirin, and a few days into it I had menstrual bleeding so severe I had to sit in the bathtub while I waited for my stimate to kick in.\n\nI do not know why this is still happening 2 weeks later, today a co-worker asked me if someone hit me in the face and I casually explained I was having blood disorder issues lately and bruising easily. Then I realized I did not recall having a bruise on my face, went to look in a mirror and sure enough there was a big bruise across my cheek.\n\nAny ideas on what could cause such a severe change? Diet can be a factor. Make sure you are eating plenty of iron-rich foods and lean protein. You may want to consider a multivitamin if you have difficulty meeting your nutritional requirements.\n\nEnvironment can play a role, too. In winter, when the air is dry, I get so. many. nosebleeds. Has anything changed recently?\n\nAs a person with vwd and a menstrual cycle, myself, I really recommend the IUD. It is done wonders for my bleeding.\n\nKeep track of all of your symptoms and share them with your hematologist during your next visit. It sounds like your treatment may need adjustment. Do not be shy about calling them sooner if you feel like this is unusual or bothersome. Lack of sleep and stress does it for me. Call your doctor to be sure that you have normal platelet numbers and do not have any other new stuff going on.  This kind of a symptom change is not typical of mild VWD and would prompt a visit to your hematologist.  Best of luck. The stimate still stops the bleeding though (unfortunately only for a day), I suspect it is VWF related because of that- it also increases factor VIII levels but I am fortunate in that my factor VIII is completely normal despite low VWF.\n\nI suspect because of having my period a few days after the onset of symptoms it is related to a drop in estrogen, I just do not get why it has not gone back to \"normal\" yet. Well I definitely have that issue, *especially* when I am bleeding like this. It is been very hot and humid the past 2 weeks, but I cannot find evidence that would affect coagulation. \n\nI am currently supplementing Iron and maximizing my protein intake.\n\nThe IUD does not seem like a good idea for me personally, my job has me twisting and straining my body in ways that causes non-menstrual uterine bleeding without having a solid object inside of there. Also I have taken the pill form of the mirena chemicals- I reacted to it horribly. Bled for 90 days straight, had a dangerous and dramatic increase in blood pressure.\n\nAs for bathtub bleeding, my hematologist told me to draw the line and go to the ER if I experience early symptoms of hemorrhagic shock. I am careful to drink fluids to maintain my blood volume when I am bleeding a lot so it does not happen. Interestingly enough, I always get the worse bleeds (Joint bleeds, extra bruising ect) a few days before and durring my period, so right now we are actually considering that maybe it is the hormones? I am not on stimate (Nasal does not work, only IV) but we did end up trying birth control, which I feel worked? But I could not continue on due to the estrogen making me sick (on Tranexamic Acid). I am visiting an Adolescent Doctor (I am a minor) who works with my Hematologist to try and work it out, but maybe visit the adult equivalent to that and try that out if this is not an isolated event? I did a bunch of research, so the blood does thin beyond the effect of an estrogen drop during that time due to the release of prostacyclin into the bloodstream when the endometrial lining start detaching. So when I go months without a period because of the depo shot and the material builds up inside of me... when a period finally happens it releases extra prostacyclin (which interferes greatly with platelet aggregation but also has a short half life). \n\nIt finally stopped btw.

Hey everyone, I am looking for to buy a mattress lately. \nThe \u201chard\u201d ones are really rough for my joints and sometimes I even wake up swollen / with pain. \n\nI never had any experience on looking for mattress so I do not even know what \u201ctype\u201d should I consider. \n\nI know it is a long shot but this is Reddit so, Any tips/hints?\n\nThanks A firm one with a soft mattress pad.

A water bed is tough with a full time partner though so I switched to an adult bed about 20 years back. Mattresses and pillows are pretty personal things. What is right for someone might not work for everyone. I bought an Emma Mattress a couple years back and it is unbelievably comfy. I recently paired it with a Panda Bamboo pillow.

Over the last two years or so we have seen the cost of my son's Amicar prescription skyrocket.  It is a problem our HTC and regular hematologist are aware of, and they said it is not uncommon right now.  Because of that, we have not filled the prescription, and luckily, we have not needed it.  The social worker at our local hospital sent me information about an Amicar Patient Assistance Program that utilizes an e-voucher at participating pharmacies, our own pharmacy being one of them.  But the website does not really explain how to use said e-voucher, nor is there anything to print off, and our CVS did not really seem to know what I was talking about.  I was curious if anybody had used this program, how to utilize it and what kind of discount it really offers?  This is the link the social worker gave me ( I have not used Amicar for a long time so I do not have any firsthand experience to offer on this unfortunately. I tried checking out the site and as far as I can tell it just lists locations that accept the voucher. If they have already given you one I would just say try calling another pharmacy to confirm they accept it and asking them how much it would cost you if you use it. CVS can be really tricky, some days they are very accomodating and others it is like I have a 16 year old on a summer job there so you could also try calling back on a different day. Sorry I could not be more help. Hope it works out for you. Contact Akorn directly at \n\nWhile you are at it, give them a piece of your mind about how they intentionally made sure the generic version went off the market. I work specialty pharmacy and the lack of a generic made things very difficult for both patients and pharmacies alike.  It is funny you mention that, until my son's clinic day last week, when the hygienist mentioned there was no longer a generic, I did not know WHY the price had gone up so drastically in two to three years.  The doctors knew it was getting harder to get/more expensive, but no one had an explanation.  So frustrating.   Akorn bought up their competition and took the generic off of the market.  Because I *clearly* have two grand laying around for my seven year old's potential mouth or nose bleed.  As people do.  Or, if I am lucky, only five hundred, sometimes, if the insurance works with me.  Where is the government to go after them as they did with the makers of the Epi-Pen? If amicar is not affordable, ask your HTC about compounded tranexamic acid.  The solution has only a two week shelf life but is cheaper and when most insurance companies I have worked with in my HTC, they will cover it. Sent.  From a parent of a 5yr old. Can I ask what kind of response you got from Akorn?  The one I received was more or less a \"ass the buck\"-style reply with no real help or information. \"As a small part of our 2014 acquisition of VersaPharm, we gained the branded Amicar product as part of our portfolio.  Unfortunately, the FDA required us to discontinue manufacture of our generic aminocaproic acid so that we did not hold unfair control of the market.\n\nWe apologize for any increased cost that your family has to endure and we do wish to help.  We offer an E-Voucher program to try and offset some of the costs associated with our product.  If you go to amicar.com, you can search for a pharmacy that participates in this program.  Then, all you need to do is have the prescription filled, the discounting is automatically processed.  You would pay the first $20, We then cover the next $130 and if anything remains you would be responsible for that portion.\n\nPlease let us know if we can answer any additional questions.\"\n Yours is better than mine: \"We apologize for the circumstances below.

As above.\n\nSevere Haemophiliac here - 0% (Haemophilia A) \nI infuse every time I get a bleed and that is between 3-7 days. \n\nI get spontaneous bleeds between 3-7 days and need to infuse. Even if I do not get a bleed, on the 6th or 7th day, I will feel pain in my body, my calves or thighs and upper arms will feel pain and sometimes even bruises may form. \n\nFor days where I am more active, I tend to bleed more frequently. (I go 3-5 days before needing factor infusion) \n\nThere are rare occasions where I am able to stretch it to 8-9 days and even 10 days without factor but those are rare and it is really just me bearing with the pain in my body. I usually give up bearing with the pain and give factor on the 8th day. \n\nI give between 750-1000 IU each time. More if its a severe bleed. \n\n\nPls state your severity of haemophilia and % level. \n\n\nBtw I f*cking hate this illness. Severa A less then 1%...every next day...third day without factor equels a bleed...hate it too... Just want to ask. Why are not you on hemlibra? Over here in Singapore, the government does not care about haemophiliacs. You can buy hemlibra but it costs several thousands of dollars per dose. And what I earn per month can afford me only ONE dose of hemlibra.\n\n\nFactor 8 is relatively affordable at $12 per 250 IU. I spend about $300+ a month on factor on average. Of course for bad months where I get serious spontaneous bleeds in my leg, it costs a lot more. Here, Romania, factor is very expensive...about 1$ per 1ui...cant buy sh!t...very bad helthcare Omg this is so horrible to hear. I pray things will get better for you. If you do not mind, may I ask what is the average wage in Romania and how much do u spend on factor a month? Average wage 400$ a month...1000ui factor...1000$\nGotten even 20days without no factor...painfull as f..k Oh no....i am so sorry to hear that. I am praying things get better for us. I thought things are bad for me. I did not know people in Romania are getting it much worse.\n\nI am so jealous of countries like USA and UK where they really care for haemophiliacs and they get hemlibra and factor for free and receive proper treatment. I used to be around 7%-11% factor level and went almost 3 years with no bleed or having to use factor at one point. Now I am building a low level inhibitor with a factor level of 3% and I typically get a bleed every month or so and it takes 2 infusions typically to heal one. Oh wow. 3 years without bleeding is wonderful. Actually bleeding once per month is quite amazing too actually.\n\nI have a friend who is at 0% factor level and he only bleeds once a month and only gives himself 500 IU each time. Which is really amazing.\n\nIt is my 7th day without factor and there is bruising all over my upper arms now =( Yeah it was my longest run, but I was in a job where I was pretty stationary and I did not do a lot other than play guitar and walk when I was not at work. My job now is pretty high physical level and I am around heavy sharp parts, but it seems age has built in some ability to avoid the bleeds subconsciously as most my recent ones have been caused by my puppy playing too rough with me.\n\nWhen I was a kid way different story though, I had a bleed basically every other week. I truly had no idea Singapore made you pay for Factor. I guess health insurance is difficult to obtain too due to preexisting condition? Yes. I do not have health insurance. Only a general one. I lived in Bali with my youngest diagnosed there as a 7 month old. Just the factor he used on demand was bankrupting us. Even on my 'larger' wage (compared to the locals I worked with), I could not afford prophylactic factor my son required. It caused more bleeds than it fixed! \ud83d\ude28\n\nI had really hoped that, 16 years later, some countries would have found ways to enable subsidised or free factor. I really respect Singapore as a modern city state, but this is incredibly disappointing to learn. I am so sorry this is your experience. It is bad here. And hemlibra costs several thousands per dose. No one can afford hemlibra.\n\nFactor used to be much more expensive. It costs about $600+ per month minimum for me on average a few years back. About $25 per 250iu. \n\nThere was once I got hospitalised for a bad hip bleed. I was hospitalised for 3 days and it costed me $2000. And on top of that I had to spend another $2000 worth of factor to inject twice a day until I fully recovered. It was madness.\n\nAnd nothing caused my hip to bleed. It just decided to bleed on its own. I went to bed and woke up with the hip bleeding. Yeah, my son is like that. 95% of his bleeds are spontaneous. He can get hit on the head with something and be fine, yet go to bed and wake up with an ankle bleed. Weird...\n\nHow do we get factor subsidised? Your son is probably severe haemophiliac? Like 1% or less I think.\n\nFor me in Singapore, its already subsidised but still expensive. They need to do more. Subsidies are done by the government. We also have a haemophilia society who further subsidises for us through fund raising and charity. The haemophilia society is doing so much. But the government needs to do more. We cannot depend on charities to subsidise us. Yes, he is severe. \n\nI was politely trying to say that the government really needs to step up and make prophylaxis free for you. Especially the severe. I am totally surprised they do not. I do not have much advice as my sons have been on prophylaxis pretty much since birth and my older still had breakthrough bleeds even on Eloctate. Both my boys are severe &gt;%0.25 factor VIII, but my older is more like you, what I call a \u201cSEVERE severe\u201d hemophiliac. My other son is a \u201cnormal severe\u201d. I still do not understand how two people can have the same (nonexistent) factor levels and yet present so differently.\n\nHemlibra has changed our lives. Say what you will about US healthcare but they do not mess around with hemophiliacs. \n\nWhen my older son had an inhibitor, his treatments cost about $450,000 a year not counting ER visits and supplies etc. Insurance covered it all. \n\nI know I am not being much help but I thank you for sharing your story. I feel so fortunate to have my boys safe and know it could be so much worse. I am glad there are some charities that try to help but you are right, charities cannot cover the whole hemophiliac population without systemic government change\u2026 Not a hemo, but a severe type 3 vWD, so I have no factor 8 or Von Willebrand factor. I have been on prophylaxis about 90% of my life. I went off when I was around 18-22 because I was dumb and lazy. I went almost 8 months with no factor and I got severe joint bleeds in my elbow that have damaged me to this day. I now inject factor 10-12x a month. Around every 3rd day. I notice more bruises and bleeding on treatment days now. They totally should. There are haemophiliacs in their 50s who are not working anymore and they have to pay for treatment too and that is disappointing Imho =( Thanks for sharing. I am glad your boys are leading almost normal lives with hemlibra! \ud83d\ude0a Thanks for sharing, radish. I hope things get better for you soon! Good point.

It is so devastating. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude22 Thanks for sharing.\n\n Living in a country with no government or insurance cover, it is a different narrative out here. Wishing your kids a happy and healthy long life to pursue all their passions! Im a mild and growing up I was around 13% and had to only infuse once that I can remember. Since getting older, I have actually come down to around 9% and infusions are more frequent. I play hockey so that probably does not help, but I usually infuse for a hockey injury once or twice a year. My doctor has suggested taking factor before hockey but that seems overkill for me. I hope your factor level goes up again to 13% or higher so you do not have to infuse! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI guess for you as long as you are careful you will not have to infuse and that is wonderful! hello blood brother! i have hemophilia A less than 0% factor activity. i'v read this post and all the comments and my heart goes out to you all. i start to hurt and ache after 48 hours after infusing. i feel like i am leaking in my joints after a bit it goes away but the sharp pains keep getting worse and worse until i finally infuse. but honestly that only happens when i get lazy with my infusions. i infuse three times a week every other day 4,000 units a dose. with the summer i'v started to work out and go out so i give myself a extra dose or half a dose just in case because it can never hurt to be too careful.   \n\n\nmy parents immigrated here to the us from Mexico and Guatemala respectively. i have a cusin who lives in Guatemala and is a doctor she took a lot of interest in hemophilia and work in a lab trying to make cost effective factor. she marveled when  i showed her the factor i brought on my visit. so believe me i know how bad it can be and i am so thankful to be born where i was and be give the help i get. that being said i do suffer a lot of pain and as a result i am depend on morphine but man i cannot spend another day having to feel that pain. i refuse.   \n\n\nif there is any way i can help dm me and we can talk. Severe A. &lt;1%\n\nWhen I was on factor, I tried the whole three days a week deal. I got stubborn. I would get hurt and try to chew through it. When it got to the point that the pain got too bad to deal with, I would dose. I would say once every two weeks or so. Maybe a month.\n\nI definitely would not recommend NOT going prophylaxis. Thanks for sharing. Are your bleeds spontaneous too? And where does it bleed usually?\n\nOnce every 2 weeks is pretty good really for a severe A haemophiliac. \n\nIm severe A as well and I bleed for absolutely no reason either at my elbows or ankles between every 3-7 days.\n\nEven if after 7 days, if my ankle or elbow does not bleed, I would get random big bruises on my thighs and upper arms and they hurt too. My bleeds were pretty split between injury and spontaneous. My left knee was the #1 target. I had both knees replaced thinking that would help, but it did not. Knee still bled. \n\nI have been on Hemlibra for two and a half years now. I have not had a single bleed. I never knew I could live a life like I am now. Am so happy for you. Hemlibra is life changing is not it?\n\nThere is Hemlibra in my country too (Singapore), but it costs several thousand dollars per dose so nobody here can afford it. (a few hundred thousand dollars per annum) Hemlibra is life changing for sure. \n\nYea, the prices are crazy here too. I guess the meds are something like $16,000 a dose.

I have Von Willebrand\u2019s (type II, I think) and have had pretty bad nosebleeds for basically my whole life (I am 25 now). I bruise pretty easily but otherwise the nosebleeds are the only symptom I have really noticed have an effect on my life.\n\nFor some reason, I have recently heard and read a lot of people talking about their \u201creally bad\u201d nosebleeds, which last for like 15-30 minutes. But I would kill for a nosebleed to only last 15-30 minutes, and I am starting to wonder if maybe my nosebleeds are bad even by bleeding disorder standards?\n\nI take Stimate (DDAVP) when I have a nosebleed, and that usually shorten them to about an hour, maybe 90 minutes if it is bad. Before I was prescribed Stimate, my nosebleeds lasted anywhere from 3-6 hours. There were a couple times I went to the ER Shen they lasted longer than that, and my longest ever was 7 hours and 45 minutes, which I got in college while I was waiting for a prescription refill :/ \n\nI have met some people with hemophilia, but as far as I know, never anyone else with Von Willebrand\u2019s, so I have never been able to compare symptoms with anyone else.

My son is currently on Hemlibra. During a visit to our hematologist today, he mentioned that a \u201cHemlibra 2.0\u201d just passed animal testing and human clinical trials are starting soon.\n\nHe said that this drug has all the benefits of Hemlibra (long half-life, subQ), but raises/mimics factor 8 levels to normal levels, whereas Hemlibra roughly gives you the equivalent of having mild hemophilia. \n\nHe did not mention the name or company - has anyone heard anything about this? I like this site when I am looking for what is in the works.\n\n\n\nMaybe one of the non-factor coagulation products I have heard the same rumors. It is only going to get better! I am waiting for the SC factor 9 to come to market :-) Probably in reference to rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN, or a recombinant factor VIII product, attached to an FC protien, as well as attached to a human made extended half life VWF molecule, as well as a new technology called XTEN, an amino acid change that should nominally extend half-life, and finally a change to the factor VIII molecule itself to make it a single, more stable chain. Essentially, a bunch of new tech to extend half life, and most importantly the replacement of human VWF factor with an extended half life version. More than 18-24 half life has been impossible for all traditional factor products, no matter what has been added, because the VWF attached to it would always get cleared in that sort of time frame.\n\n\nCalling it \"hemlibra 2.0\" is in a way disingenuous, as it is different in most ways from a technical stand point, but on the other hand it does give the two main benefits. I have not looked at the newer clinical trial data (looks like there is maybe some phase 3 data or will be some coming soon?) but it is certainly very exciting.

Key parameters for optimisation included\nefficient activation of FX by FIXa in the presence of procoagulant\nmembrane, low target binding in blood circulation, low immunogenicity\nrisk, and low viscosity. The activity of Mim8 was tested\nin thrombin generation assays (TGA) and by thromboelastography\n(TEG). The TGA was initiated with FXIa or with tissue factor (TF)\nusing congenital HA plasma or normal human plasma spiked with\nanti-FVIII\nantibodies. The TEG was initiated with low level TF/recalcification\nonly using human whole blood spiked with anti-FVIII\nantibodies.\nIn vivo, the effect of Mim8 was assessed in two tail bleeding\nmodels using FVIII-deficient\nmice co-dosed\nwith human FIX and FX\nto circumvent lack of Mim8 cross reactivity to murine FIX and FX.\nThe PK of Mim8 was studied in cynomolgus monkeys.\n\n&gt;Results: Mim8 efficiently assembled FIXa and FX on the phospholipid\nsurface and stimulated FXa activation. The proteolytic activity of FIXa was stimulated ~15 \u00d7 103-fold\nby the monovalent anti-FIXa\narm. The affinity (Kd) of Mim8 for FIXa and FX is in the micromolar\nrange, minimising target binding in the blood. Mim8 efficiently\nstimulated thrombin generation in both TGA assays and enhanced\nclot formation in TEG. The potency of Mim8 in these assays was\n~15 times greater than the potency of the FVIII mimetic antibody\nemicizumab. A similar potency improvement was demonstrated in a\ntail vein transection bleeding model in mice. The terminal half-life\nof\nMim8 was ~14 days in cynomolgus monkeys.\nDiscussion/Conclusion: Mim8 is a novel, next-generation\nFVIII mimetic\nbispecific antibody which potently stimulates FX activation\nand thereby the haemostatic capacity as demonstrated in vitro and in\nvivo. The high potency of Mim8 is expected to enable administration\nof small volumes in a pen device. Further, minimal target binding in\nthe blood, good PK and biophysical properties of Mim8 support clinical\ndevelopment of Mim8 as a potentially improved FVIII mimetic\nprophylactic treatment for persons with haemophilia A regardless\nof inhibitor status.\n\n( That would be amazing.

I can say that with relative confidence after doing a little research. to give a little details about my physical activity, I am not very active, and because of the lockdown for the past 6 months, my movement has been even more limited. But since the last 2 months, I have started going on for brisk walks over the weekend, covering distance above 4-8 km on Saturday and Sundays, I am wondering if that is the culprit, in any case I would really appreciate if you guys can help me with suggestions and advices on how to deal with it, I already have a target left knee, which is in A bad shape since my childhood, thanks, and cheers! If it is not getting worse than it is healing, this might take longer than a few days. Tendon issues and muscle issues take me at least 4-5 days to heal through. Sound like you are doing all you can do to help the healing process. If it worsens with the current treatment you are doing the call your htc or primary doctor for advice. Well come to think of it, actually yes, when I am lying down for and not moving around for longer periods, the soreness and tightness is less worse,  I think you are right, maybe it will take some time to recover, but I want to ask one more thing, should I absolutely try to not walk?, or what kind of exercises I can do which will aid in recovery after the inflammation and tightness is gone? Thank you for the valuable advice :) I would not try and do too much. If you can walk then walk but maybe not as much as normal for you. I mostly try and get movement in bleeds that are healing once I get out of the shower or after a session with a heating pad. Some stretching when its warm will help keep the blood moving and can speed up healing. Heating pad? A stupid question, but are not we supposed to apply ice, my doctor told me that heat is bad for my joints (haemophilliacs in general), but that was a long time ago, and I have found that ointments are a bit effective, so would it be okay if I went the heating pad way and for how long ? Sorry if I am asking too many questions. Yes in general heating pads can be bad if used early in treatment for bleeds. I only switch from ice to heat once I know for sure that the bleed is healing. I like to wait until the bleed is 60% healed and then switch to heat to get it to 100% quicker.\n\nI do heating pad for 15 minutes and then try and get a few good stretches in. That is indeed interesting, I was unaware of it, the doctors around me are a bit too paranoid to suggest heat pads, but that is a really good insight, thanks! Good luck on the speedy recovery! How are our ankles?  Is it possible with your other bad knee that you are hyper extending the knee when you walk?\n\nHave you tried a tensor bandage when walking.  I was having very simad issues but started to bandage my knee before walking.  I would wrap my knee in a slightly bent position and ice for 20 minutes after my walking.  It took 2 weeks but my knee no longer hurts but I do keep it wrapped when exercising. I am not sure if my answer is the right one, but speak to your doctor. They might recommend taking more factor over a period of a few days. The doctors are paranoid for a reason!\n\nIn terms of exercise I would wait until the pain subsides and look into Yin Yoga. This involves holding very light stretches for around 3 minutes and using breathing techniques. I get bleeds in my ankles but not too often, they are in good shape, my right ankle more than the left one, actually I never thought of it that way,  it maybe yes I do hyperextend my right knee more, and I also exert most of my weight when I walk on it, maybe it is a reflex since the other one is not strong enough to bear it, but lately I have made a habit of making the other leg do most of the work. \n\nTensor bandage, now that is something I have never heard of, and sounds like a good idea too!, But would not walking with a slightly bent knee impede with the comfort? But I will surely give this a try, thank you :) Yes, absolutely I have been in touch with my doctor, I have been administering myself with 1500 IU every other day as needed, along with applying ice and wrapping it up in a firm bandage,. I am actually intrigued by Yin Yoga, could you perhaps tell me more about it? ^_^ The tensor bandages are flexible.  You will still be able to straighten it but will have resistance making it much harder to hyper extending it. That is good to hear. You will be back to normal soon!\n\nYin yoga is a very slow form of yoga which is about rest and recovery. The majority of it is seated or lying down so there is very little high impact on your joints compared with Ashtanga yoga for example. You hold stretches for around three minutes, even longer if you have the time, and you do not push yourself to have a deep stretch that is uncomfortable. You stretch to a point which feels comfortable so that you can hold the postures for a long time. \n\nI have practiced a few forms of yoga and this is by far one of my favourites, especially before bed or after strenuous physical activity.\n\nThere are a ton of videos online but I recommend starting with Travis Elliott\u2019s short and sweet sessions which are freely available on YouTube.

I am also unfortunately on a campus that forces me to do a lot of walking, so that may exacerbate the bleeding if it is really taking place, but I was just wondering if anyone else had ever struggled with the idea that lingering bleeds are \"all in their heads\" and what sort of sanity checks you all have come up with.", "THIS is what Hemophilia looks like  The zero-sum game played by a lot of women in the community (and not just those who have symptoms) is unproductive - there is no need to emphasize your experience over others, implying that when men have hemophilia it is somehow lesser. I am in no way minimizing the real struggle men face, rather, I am bringing attention to the fact that many women with hemophilia are ignored and not getting life saving treatment they need.  Thanks for watching &gt;I am in no way minimizing the real struggle men face\n\nSure you are - \"THIS\" is what hemophilia *also* looks like. But yours is not the sole experience.\n\n&gt;Thanks for watching\n\nDid not and will not. Sorry to hear that... You would need to watch the video to understand I am not doing that. I use the word \"also\". That means \"in addition to\".  In fact, my point is that most people believe the hemophilia experience is solely men and it is also women.  Good luck in your journey.  Blessings and good health  to you.  &gt;You would need to watch the video to understand I am not doing that.\n\nThat is the title you submitted here *and* the image you used for the thumbnail, so it is clearly the point of view you want to espouse.\n\nI have got no time for shrill harpies who want to make it about them and them alone. There are over 20 people in the video And you are responsible for your own message, so I suggest you go back to the drawing board and understand why you are alienating the majority of patients with that message. I am sorry you feel that way... Without seeing the video the conversation cannot continue as you do not understand what was done.  I wish you well.  Maybe one day our paths will cross at a hemophilia conference. Going in hard like this and calling someone you proudly did not even listen to speak a \"shrill harpy\" is a bad look that comes off misogynistic. OP and her ilk basically salt the earth of every other hemophilia community out there, so quite frankly I would be incredibly disappointed if that sort of shit invaded this sub. Last thing we need is for this sub to become another place for deranged hemomoms to wank about how bad they have got it and pay lip service to the majority of patients. Now let us be fair to the MDs.  Female carriers of the disease were long thought to be asymptomatic.  This is mostly true.  Those women who do bleed more than normal are getting treated in HTCs and educated Women's clinics that have close access to HTCs.  Things are getting better.  Not all the way, but getting better.  When we diagnose a boy, we test the sisters and relate to them and their parents that they could bleed more than other girls.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that the mechanism for training people on this is impaired by rarity of the condition (affected carriers of hemophilia vs women who have hypertension) and the unclear mechanism that causes them to bleed (remember 50% activity is normal for most carriers, but not for all carriers), so the CME session gets a bit foggy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResearch on speed of activation and other non-factor activity specific clotting issues are underway and coming forward.  As this helps to clarify the issues surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of affected carriers, this problem will improve. What a great comment!  Yes!  They are learning that the lyonization process is a big factor in what determines the levels of factor women have.  Lyonization is the random inactivation of duplicate X chromosomes in utero.  As such, some women do well and end up with the non-affected X chromosomes remaining and some women struggle and end up with even severe Hemophilia.\n\nWe are in a time of rapidly changing understandings of women with Hemophilia.  Some cutting edge HTCs now have women\u2019s clinics and amazing staff, some are still old school and do not treat women, even if they have lower levels of factor.\n\nI think we are going to see many shifts in treatment for women in the next 10 years.... and I am so glad to see how far it has already come! I am an HTC director.  Lyonization is part of it. What I am finding concerns many women right now is the lack of research on women with Hemophilia.  As HTCs continue to expand care I hope research is initiated in a variety of areas to establish efficacy of treatment options.\n\nThe HTCs I have been with have been helpful.  (I am also very educated and self advocate well).  Sadly, I hear too many stories of women with Hemophilia who have not accessed appropriate care. Access to care for hemophilia is a global problem for both genders.  70% of boys with severe hemophilia have no access to factor.\n\nIn the US, there are a few hundred \"federally funded\" HTCs.  There is also the \"Big Giant V\" in the middle of the country that cannot get to an HTC within a 100 miles of their home.  The feds cut the travel funds for our outreach clinics into the V world (the great plains), and then they started to complain about the V.  \n Very true!  This is why we also have to get information out to the many medical professionals in the USA (and beyond) that are \"in the trenches\".  The highly limited training on bleeding disorders they have been exposed to is often not sufficient for treating our bleeding community members for sure.\n\n Shill harpy is way to much pimpin...... every point you have made was just negated because you now look like a real piece of shit. Nah - OP is here purely to push a biased agenda - fuck all that noise and anyone who supports such divisive messaging. But you said you did not watch the video, so how do you know it is divisive?  Anyway, what I am trying to address is or poor communication, you are losing your message because of your attitude.  In the case that you are correct and she is being divisive, you are helping her build a case and gain footing to be in this sub.   Just pay attention to how you are coming across and if it matters so little that you do not care how you come across, shut the fuck up and find something else to do  &gt;But you said you did not watch the video, so how do you know it is divisive? \n\nIf the presentation is divisive, and if OP's posts are divisive, and if she continues to use the same messaging when it is pointed out, then it is divisive.\n\nIf she cared that much about changing the message she would have deleted the post and resubmitted. Instead she wants to do that faux Girl Power thing. Fuck all that. OP has only been on Reddit for 1 day and this was the first post..... and attacking me assuming I am defending her is just you try to misdirect the conversation.  I am not trying to say one way or the other, did not watch the video because the link is bad, more importantly I give zero fucks. I have male and female family members that have hemophilia and I have my own opinions.  But you are failing on getting yours across because of the way you choose to communicate  &gt;OP has only been on Reddit for 1 day and this was the first post..... \n\nThey have since gone on to make 2 more in the span of one day, which proves my point.\n\n&gt;But you are failing on getting yours across because of the way you choose to communicate\n\nI see no reason to be nice to extremists. OP can be respectful to the whole of the patient experience or she can fuck off, there is no middle ground here. Tldr?", "Elbow bleed on hemlibra? Anyone had any actual joint bleeds on hemlibra? I only ever had one bleed in my elbow in my life. And now I do not even really think I injured my elbow. I lifted some heavy stuff a month or so ago  , and it felt like I had tennis elbow a bit after that, and it has gradually gotten worse. Until last night when I got super low energy and felt off, so I did an infusion of factor and I woke up this morning and my elbow was stiff , like a bleed gets after infusing. It is hard to know how to treat this. Any thoughts? My left elbow is a target joint. Went from like 15 bleeds per year (while on prophy with Eloctate) to 2 per year (been on Hemlibra for a year and a half, 4 months of that being once per two weeks infusions).\n\nMy bleeds were caused directly by doing something like lifting weights wrong or banging my elbow on something.\n\nDo you mean you treated with Hemlibra?\n\nBecause, remember, Hemlibra is NOT a normal treatment like Recombinant, Advate, Eloctate, etc. It is a preventative treatment that you only take on your required schedule that helps lessen chances of a bleed. If you have a bleed, you are supposed to treat with your regular factor treatments. It is possible you got a bleed in your elbow and did not treat it with your normal medication and Hemlibra could not do enough to completely get rid of it and it got worse from there.\n\nI would call your local HTC and talk to them about it to see what exactly they need you to do, but a joint bleed while on Hemlibra is not uncommon. It is a bit of a tricky and newer drug, so the full effects of what it can and cannot do are still a little confusing per person. I treated with factor Just making sure.\n\nSo, I am not a doctor so take what I say with a grain of salt but I am pretty sure my HTC would tell me to get another round of factor for at least one more day and check back in with them on how it is going.\n\nBut your HTCs might be different. So I would recommend calling one and if you do not know if there is one in your area and you are in the US (not sure if this site shows international locations) here is where you can find one.\n\n Thanks. I know the htc here really well. I will treat it like a bleed and infuse as I normally would and see if it gets better. That is all they will say. I am not sure what I was looking for here. I guess me being severe and using Hemlibra puts me in the moderate range. So I am used to bleeds getting bad right away. This one took a while to get bad, and is not as bad as a normal bleed. But I know it is one and I should not take it lightly. It is just strange being on hemlibra. Because of that. I can injure myself and instead of it destroying me, it kind of hurts, then gets slowly worse if I do not treat it, until it is been two weeks, and it really starts hurting and it occurs to me that it is actually been a bleed all along. I hope I do not do more damage to my joints this way. All in all Hemlibra is working great. It is just a hard adjustment to make. I do not know how to gauge how bad injuries are anymore, or when and how much to treat for them. Until it is bad enough to be what I used to consider a bleed. Am I making sense? Anyways, thanks. Ya, joint bleeds are the worst. I have never had a joint bleed until about 3 years ago and in the span of 1 year it went from a bleed every 3 months in my elbow, then one every month, then every other week for a month before it was hitting a nerve or something and it was probably the most painful feeling ever. My whole arm was tingling and in extreme pain. I almost passed out at the Infusion Center when they were giving me my treatment because that moment where I could focus on the lighter pain of the needle for the infusion helped briefly release my elbow pain and my blood pressure plummeted for a moment and then spiked back up again when the pain came back.\n\nI will definitely never take a joint bleed for granted again. Most regretful decision ever was thinking it was a muscle bleed the first time I had it and I held off until the next day to get it treated cause I did not want to go to the ER since my Infusion Center was closed that day. Yea it is hard. It is hard to explain to people, I am a parent  of two and live with my gf and her two kids. So trying to explain why you are suddenly out of commission, as well as in an inexplainable amount of pain and discomfort. It is like being in fight or flight mode 24/7, every move you make has to be calculated. It is super stressful. This one is not super bad, the Hemlibra held it off for the most part I guess. But the last elbow bleed I had lasted 3 months until I could even move, as in walk or be in a car or anything that jumbled me around, and then it was another 3 months before I could really use my right arm. And I am right handed. It is really hard for someone who heals normally to have any understanding any of that. I also know what it is like to be injured and heal back up. I am like that if I infuse daily. It is great. Injuries hurt, yea, but they heal and are not a problem. Once you get a bleed it is another story completely. The amount we suffer will never be recognized. I want to be a good example to my kids, and be a fair partner to my gf. If I can do something , I will, and I do. But when suddenly I cannot, and I lay still and do not motivate my kids to be active, I feel like I set a bad example. And it is hard for them to understand that I am not lazy, and I do not think it is a good thing to lay still and watch tv or read for weeks on end. The pain and anguish we go through is unbelievable. Then, one day, I am suddenly better. (Or so it seems because I am ok enough to get moving). It is such an ordeal. Every time. Bad bleeds suck. Especially joint bleeds. Typing this probably is not a good idea (for my elbow) but it feels good to vent to someone who might get it. There is more to pain than physically hurting. Theres suffering, stress, anguish, boredom, restlessness, anxiety from seeing what needs doing and not being able to do it. Then it piles up and I do it when I am barely healed enough to move, and have to push through that pain hoping I am not causing it to re bleed or favor my other side so it bleeds. Fun stuff. Fuuuuuun times. But god forbid it affects your mood. Do not complain because you will never hear the end of it if you do. That is why it is so much easier to be alone when I am dealing with a bleed. But I am supposed to be engaged and present, especially now that I am supposed to home school my kids. They are calling it distance learning, but it means I am the principal, teacher and kid wrangler. Fuck me.

I do not know.  EVERY product for hemophilia is tested with ABR as part of the test data.  Be it the long acting products or Hemlibra or the new generation of TFPI blockers, this data point is in all of them.  It does not matter if your level goes up if you still bleed.  The problem this poses for gene therapy is that most of the patients will have been on prophy for while and their personal ABRs will be low due to that making statistical analysis of ABR reduction difficult if not impossible.  Hard to say that a 20 year old guy who has an ABR of 1-2 over the past 5 years while on prophy would have had some higher number without it as a significant number of patients have variable bleeding rates (some bleed frequently and have very high ABRs and others go months without one and can artificially lower their ABR.)

As I can go back to base camp for ice.  But I am not sure how well that will handle my needs. What factor are you using? Recombinate is able to be stored for a short period at room temperature these days, packing it in a small cooler should be more than enough to keep it within temperature range.  Infuse before heading out (maybe a double dose to get closer to 100%) and leave the rest of your factor at base camp.

FWIW, I have used factor that has been left in my garage over the summer with temperatures well over 90 degrees and probably quite a few days closer to 100.  I am not recommending anybody else do it, but it is not quite as sensitive to temperature as you think.  Take what you need on your trips and use it on the trail.  If you bring some home after your trip, just make sure you use it first.  The recommended storage temperatures are to make the factor last through the expiration date.  Do not let it slow you down. Usually the label will also say that if the factor gets above a certain temperature, it is still good, but that you should not refrigerate it again. So you can store at room temperature, just do not cool it again after that.  There is also excursion data that you can get from Shire with more info than is on the box or insert.

You may need to pay for dental and optical treatment as well as medicine prescribed by the doctor and collected from a pharmacy.) \n\nAgain, I am no expert, and I can imagine haemophilia being a little more complex - but what it seems to suggest is that, you pay the health surcharge, and effectively access NHS services like any UK resident - which for me, means I am a patient at my local HTC, and the regional NHS Trust covers the cost of treatment and would provide your treatment - no insurance needed. It is worth flagging, that this is a particular perk of the 'T4 student visa' - there is an interesting article that discusses the challenges of 'entitlement' to haemophilia care for non-student migrants ( Thak you,  I will check it out.

My levels got a lot better when I lost a ton of weight.\n\nJust talk to your hematologist. I have a hematologist appt (but with my non HTC local Hemo) and also already talked to my pcp ... I ride 100+ miles a week and am a normal weight so it does not make sense... I switched to an EHL product for prophy so was curious if the pegylation (sp?) may cause elevated levels... Maybe it is? Who knows but hopefully your docs can help you. Since you are a hemo patient you may have an easier time getting in to see a hepatologist. Hoping it works out for you! Thanks! I am not super worried at this point... they will run more blood work. Some even say that hard workouts can sometimes raise them and I work out a lot! No. Before Hemlibra I was using 4000 units of factor VIII every other day for 30+ years, and because of hep-c I had to get my blood drawn and a liver panel every 3 months or so. Even with hep-c my levels were normal. There has never been any indication (as far as I know) that factor harms your liver, unless like me you got hep-c from it. But that was in the 80\u2019s before they were testing for it and before they had ways to purify the factor. A lot of things you do can affect your liver numbers tho. Factor just is not one of them. Although I was not on an EHL product so who knows. The old stuff works the best for me. Thanks. There is a very small amount of data on PEG technology with other drugs that hints it might impact the liver..... So it is definitely an EHL question.", "Periods extremely heavy post-baby Had a baby a few months ago. The first two periods were OK, but now my flow is extremely heavy. As in, I am constantly leaking through and the moment I stand up there is a gush of blood. Anyone else with a similar experience? I do not really want to get infused with factor if I do not need to. Can I just wait it out?\n\nI am a mild hemophiliac (level around 20%). Why dont you want to be infused? Factor is known to have minimal side effects if not using older generations of hemophiliac medicaments...\n\nUse it. Even 20% can mean blood anemia or brain damage or organ damage if anemia goes on for too long\n\nIm a male with under 1% activity of the lever and i urge you to take the meds... at least for the coming months or year Dont wait it out... Hi there!\n\nI am not a mother, but I do have severe type 3 vWD with menstrual bleeding issues. From what I know about postpartum health in women with bleeding disorders, your factor levels kind of crash and no longer have that support from the baby.\n\nPostpartum is also a different experience for any new mom, hormone levels are settling, factor levels are affected by hormones and stress levels so it is not surprising (entirely) that you are bleeding more.\n\nWhat does sound concerning is the amount of bleeding. If you are able to talk to your care team about getting some factor infusions or checking your hemoglobin levels, I would. I do not know your access to care, so I would also suggest a more iron rich diet and reach out to friends and family for any additional help you need. \n\nA baby takes SO much energy. I took care of my baby niece for 3 days and nights and I was WIPED, so kudos to you mama! Thanks! It is just weird because my first two periods were fine. Now it is worse. \n\nThe funny part is recently I am trying to go on a vegetarian diet....so not eating a lot of meat at the moment. I suppose I can try to eat more spinach, etc.\n\nMy hemoglobin levels crashed to 7 post labor, but what is weird is, I felt completely fine. (The doctor was concerned though lol).\n\nArgh, I guess I could reach out to the clinic to get a test done...I feel like I have a lot on my plate and do not want to add to it, lol. Cost, time, etc. I would probably have to go to the clinic to get another test first. Then I would have to order the factor, get it shipped, and get a nurse to come do the infusion (I am not savvy enough to do it on my own).  Anyway, I suppose I can look into it....just something else to do in addition to working full time and caring for a baby, lol. How much would a dosage cost and how long would it last? Learning how to administer it yourself can be very helpful, i myself learned it when i was 10 in about 7 days... could be useful especially if you dont have too much time on your hands...\n\nIf you need any help whatsoever or any tips and tricks feel free to ask I am on a new insurance plan at the moment with a high deductible. So I suppose I could pay up to 3500 out of pocket max. I think the cost will be maybe a few hundred to 1k for each infusion? The dosage would prob last a couple days, although they had me infusing daily post delivery for a few days.....\n\nI actually have some sample Xyntha left in my fridge though, which I could use. I have never inserted a needle on my own though...but if I can figure that out I could just use the samples I have. Xyntha seems to cost from 300 to 500 per dosage depending on where you buy. If your ensurance doesnt cover it most of the time there are funds to help you. If you and your husband have spare income or savings, even two or three weeks of a dosage every 2 or 3 days can help a long way in mitigating damage and helping the healing process\n...\n\nIf your husband can help you the easiest would be to try arm or hand or feet veins on him... use thin needels and try to prepare yourself either by talking to medical friends, watch videos or seek help of a doctor or medical staff... the first few times can be very difficult but dont let yourself down. Use fresh needels all the time and disinfect the area before you inject the needel. After desinfecting the area whipe it once with a cloth if thers excess desinfectant... do some weight or sport before so your blood goes to your arms more (higher blodd pressure if you have trouble finding veins) use a strip of elastic cloth to wrap around your arm to stop the bloodflow and open the cloth again when injecting... try injecting NACL (every pharmacy has these) to train and use the normal dosage after youve gotten some confidence. \n\nIf the bleeding is as bad as youve said, seek a dosage immediately and get it administered by a local doctor or pharamcy or someone (maybe your freind circle has a person which knows her/his stuff with veins and can help you) Thanks for the advice!! You need to be using Lysteda/tranexamic acid. Start it on the first sign of period coming and continue until 2 days after period ends. Also for what it is worth infusing factor has dramatically changed my quality of life. \n\nSource: I am a type 3 von willebrands patient (VWF 7, fviii 9, ristocetin cofactor 9) Agreed. Why not infuse?  Infusing has radically changed my life for the better. You can get a home health nurse to do it if you are scared How are you measuring and recording your blood volume loss? Your doctor needs data to understand the extent of the emergency. \nPersonally I use a menstrual cup as each cup holds 30ml. So I record date and time of overflowing my 30ml cup: it is easier to say to a doctor \u201cI have lost 400mo in the last 24 hours\u201d vs \u201cit is super heavy!\u201d \nIf you are not open to using a menstrual cup, I would record exactly what type of tampon or pad you are using (they vary in absorption rates) and record date and time. That way you can say \u201cI have used 17 super plus tampons in the last 24 hours\u201d again that is much more helpful for a doctor to treat you vs just saying it is heavy bleeding I like to drink a big thing of water or Gatorade before so I am super hydrated because the veins are more plump.  Also I take a super hot shower before to get my veins showing You need to take care of you to keep doing all the things everyone else needs from you. You are no good if you collapse. (Said from someone else who does not want to slow down because everything else will pile up and wait for you) Pair the menstrual cup with some period panties like Thinx or some off brand ones from Amazon. You will be super protected from leaks. They are a bit spendy, but you will save so much time and energy on cleaning, and all kinds of money on disposable tampons and pads. \n\nTranexamic acid may be a lot easier than infusions if you are really not interested in trying those yet.", "Started Hemlibra today I started my first initial loading dose of Hemlibra today. I am hoping that it works well. So far so good. The injection was so much better than IV. I was a little scared because of how much medicine had to go in, but it was not that bad. I may break next the dose next week in 2 shots, but the one shot today was not bad. Night and day from IV. I think it is mostly mental and anticipation, but I felt much better walking out of the HTC today than going in after the injection. Time will tell, but my joints feel different than they did. Ankles especially. I will update as it goes along.\n I have been using Kovaltry as needed as the constant barrage of shots got to me on prophylaxis. I am severe Hemophillia A. On as needed regimen, I averaged 1-2 bleeds a month depending on activity. Sometimes more in real active months, but not many. Kovaltry seemed to help a great deal. I have high hopes for the Hemlibra, I hope it does not disappoint. Hope it works for you!  I am bit surprised you are not on prophy previously with that amount of bleeding. Nice! Let us know how it works for you. Curious how many cc's of hemlibra do you have to take? Thanks for sharing! Please keep us updated on your progress. It was right at 2 CCs worth if I am thinking right, the syringe was right under the 2ML mark. It was right at the limit for one shot. That is why I may split it in two. I havnt no pain or anything at the injection site. It looks maybe ever so slightly swollen still, but feels fine. My joints still feel great, well as great as they can. I walked down stairs today for the first time in a while with no pain and no rail.  I had to drive about 400 miles today and usually have pretty sore elbows and ankles when I drive that far, but they dont hurt at all either. I hope it continues, so far so good. My son has been on Hemlibra for 2 months now and it has been a life changer. Hope the same goes for you friend. I e  even on Hemlibra since it was released six months ago or so. Severe A, I had to do 3000 every other day and still bled 3-4 times a month. I was unable to work out or do normal activities without being sore after at best, usually having a bleed and being down for a few days. Since Hemlibra I have been swimming twice a week, bike riding, going on long walks, and working out with no bleeds. It is awesome. Total life changer. I e had a couple of small bleeds that I treated for normally, but they only took 1 infusion to stop. One thing I experienced was sore joints, in places I never had bleeds before, it was a side affect called arthralgia. It is was pretty bad, until I split my dose in half, and instead of doing 2cc\u2019s every two weeks, I take 1 cc every week, and the arthralgia went away. I think I was having an immune response to the delivery system, but with half as much medicine my body does not see it as a foreign substance and does not create a response. Anyway, good luck. I am sure it is going to go great for you too. 34yr Severe A here, would hemlibra be viable for those with ports? Or would the port be removed. I apologize for not researching beforehand but I feel this community is more forth giving with knowledge than a stack of research papers and forums with helicopter parents. I have a port, I was planning on keeping it to use in case I need medicine as i have had it for 10 years now. I may see to have it removed later, but I am not sure what that process will be. Ah I see. That makes sense for emergency doses. Thank you Six months now. Not a single bleed. Nothing. I am a Severe A. In fact, I smashed my thumb with a hammer and the nail turned all black. I have done this a few times before, and my finger would always swell. I would have to take my meds for a week just so I could use my hand again. This time, the next day it was perfectly functional. Not a single issue. I am still adjusting to the fact of bumping my arm or smacking my knee, and not having to worry about the joint swelling up for a week. So weird. 2cc is supposed to be the limit for a subq injection so you might want to consider splitting it (I do 2x1.7cc for my monthly dose). It can feel like a lot more than it is depending on what gauge needle you are using, too. Welcome to the club! My drill fell from the top of my 6 foot ladder today and landed right on my foot.

Here is a short documentary on hemophilia my students made for the state contest. ", "Blown Veins Hello Reddit, \nSo I was in Kentucky for a wedding and sprained my ankle pretty bad, luckily I had my factor with me. Unfortunately when I hit the vein I call my go to in my left arm, it blew, I went for my secondary in my right arm, same thing. \nI came back home to Chicago and am trying to treat myself again and I have had the same thing happen. This has NEVER happened to me before. I refer to my veins as a school bus and a Mac truck because of how big they are and I have always been able to hit one. \nI am obviously concerned because I need to get factor in me, but more so because I am not use to blowing veins so regularly. Has anyone had this issue?\nOr any familiarity with blown veins?  You will have to try to find other veins. Using just one or two will cause scar tissue to build up, making them harder to access and easier to blow. Take a tourniquet to both arms and scope out the battlefield. Use your fingers to feel, not your eyes to see. 9 times out of 10, you will find a vein using touch that you cannot visably see, and it will be a good one. \n\nGood places to look for veins: your AC (inside of the elbow), forearms (front, back, sides, depending on how skinny you are), back of the hand (there is usually a good one near your thumb, sort of in the middle of the thumb and wrist). Typically, if you can find one, you can trace it up your arm with your fingers. That way, you will not be injecting in the same area all the time.\n\nAs for mending blown veins, apply warmth to the area to facilitate absorption of the free blood. This will also reduce brusing. \n\nSource: hemophiliac and RN.  I typically blow veins when I am super stressed out and blowing the first only adds to the stress. What is helped me are some basic breathing exercises, finding a way to relax, and most importantly water. Being hydrated helps a lot. Try looking for veins in unexplored territory. Hope this helps! I went through a bad stretch a while back and it sucked. Unlike you, my veins do not show at all and do not even pop up enough to feel. Then my go to spots (I called them \"Old Faithful\") got deflated by crappy phebotomists. You will just need to search. The other option (as a last resort) is to go ABOVE the spots you have blown. But, like I said, it is a last resort if you need factor ASAP.\n\nThe only other spot that nobody else has said is your feet (obviously not the foot with the bleed). It will hurt like hell and you will need to make sure to keep disinfected. You have more of a chance to get an infusion spot infected on your feet. I have had to do it a few times, and even when I was a child and had to go to the e.r. for a shot they had to go there many many times...even in my head once when I was a toddler. Any vein you can get to.\n\nA very, very, very last resort you can have your hemo Dr's office call your local hospital and go to the ER. Just walking in without warning might be a hassle, but a referral from your Dr will make it easier.\n\nGood luck, just keep your head up. Every one of us has to infuse regularly has a bad luck streak with veins.  Blown veins can suck but like some of the others have said it is wise to switch your veins up. I typically cycle through about 10 different spots so one does not get over worked. Being hydrated and in shape also helps with vascularity and creating healthy veins. Good luck!  I really appreciate your tips for mending blown veins! I am a mild Hemo so I have one strong vein in the AC of both elbows. I will admit it is quite intimidating truing places like my forearms and hands, but I know my 2 AC's wont last forever. Thank you for the advice.  I totally find the same to be true. I was able to hit a new vein which felt great to be able to do. Thanks for the help! I have tried the \"move up\" approach and it usually works fairly well for me. The foot is also something I am familiar with, very unpleasant, but its better than not getting my factor. Thank you for the insight.  WOW, 10 spots!?!?! I wont lie that seems impossible to me, but in all fairness I have been very distant with my condition until recent years of independence has force me to face my hemophilia. You have given me a goal. Thank you!! It is takes time especially if you are new to embracing the disorder and being independent. Just keep at it and you will be fine! Best of luck!

Man fuck fuck. I feel so usless and weak Do not beat yourself up.  We have all had bad injection experiences.  The key is not to get overwhelmed.  Take a break and go back and try again.  Drink some water and have a hot shower to help get you veins to plump up.\n\nAlso try finding some other injection sitesto try.  There might be some other spots you find easy.  Do not give up, you got this. Just hate seeing a small plump from the liquid injecting outside the vein. Its disturbing to me for some reason. But it makes me feel like i need this one thing or else i cant live right. I cant wait to take helimbra bro. Also heard theres genetic therapy for having permanent 12% factor level or somthing like that. Welp thanks for reminding me that im not alone. Ty brother. You are not alone man. I used to have to infuse every day and eventually after years of that my veins were shot. At one point I would just call my ex, that way my blood pressure would go thru the roof and I could hit any vein. Yea it sucks missing. At one point I would miss like 8 times a day sometimes. Things are better now tho. Things can improve. I am 46 now and I am healthier and stronger than ever by far. Keep trying, this stuff will make you tougher at least. Take care It is very weird to me how we all have this same experience of fucking up and feeling just miserable. Like when I was already in a bad place and I missed a vein I have actually just cried in the past. I think it helps to think about the fact that you are doing something that has a whole medical field dedicated to it, TO YOURSELF, and you are just a guy. Definitely not a useless weak human being. Like its ok when i miss one time. But when i miss twice or more, it just gets infuriating cause i cant get it anywere and most of the time end up just putting half of it in if i miss it alot I do not know your situation, so I hope I do not end up discouraging you due to lack of access or something, but I would you are having to do prophylaxis, I would suggest looking into Hemlibra if you can.\n\nI have been on it like two years and it is life changing. Far fewer bleeds and subcutaneous injections are easy as heck.\n\nIf it is not an option and your just have tough veins you might consider a port.

Just when i start missing like 3 times ina row it pisses me off a ton Most of the times it is all mental.  You start second guessing yourself after you have missed a few times.  You just want to get it done and over with. It can be alot of pressure.  After you miss the second time, take a 5 to 10 minute break.  Walk away.

I am sure people will answer. \ud83d\udc4d Yes, we have all been there and it sucks. Here are a few old tricks I used to do for my crappy hand veins. First, go get some off the shelf magnifying glasses at your local drugstore. Have good lighting. I would use a desktop halogen lamp! Use 25 or even 27 gauge butterflies. Lastly, soak your hand in a sink full of hot water\u2026as hot as you can tolerate\u2026 for about five minutes. Put the odds in your favor. Back when I treated on demand, there was nothing worse than trying to stick the vein using the hand of a sore elbow\u2026or sticking into the hand of the sore arm. These things helped get the job done. Oh man, yeah, I feel your frustration. To be clear though, it is most likely not your technique that is at fault. \n\nBeen on profy for 13 years, injection 3 times a week. \n\nWhen I miss I know it is not my technique, it is my veins just not cooperating that day. I got my old faithful in my left arm, then I have several others spread out that I can use if I want to. \n\nWhen old faithful fails I try one more time in another vein, and if that does not work I just scrap everything and drink even more fluids and try to get my blood pressure up by doing work around the house. \n\nSometimes it is just a crap day.

When you consider that hemophilia is a rare disease with a population of ~400,000 worldwide and there are good treatments available, what is the impetus for innovation? Pharma companies can make big bucks sticking with the status quo.\n\nThe last 20 years have been a huge improvement for hemophilia patients:\n\n* In first world countries, you have an entire cohort of patients who will not have been exposed to tainted blood products.\n\n* The fact that there ARE trials going on for gene therapy is a major advancement. The idea that hemophilia could be cured by the time your children or grandchildren are born is amazing.\n* Product is easier to make up AND has longer half life\n* ACCESSIBILITY.  This is still an issue in hemophilia and although there have been improvements, could still be worked on even more. Plenty of people with hemophilia around the world do not have access to basic treatment.  In some countries, they are just starting to get prophylactic treatment.  I believe in Brazil they only got prophylaxis around 2010. In India they still use casting as a way of correcting orthopaedic issues.\n\nI think the advancements in hemophilia have been huge and to say that not much has changed is to ignore some amazing innovations and the plight of people with hemophilia around the world.\n\n*Written from a Canadian perspective. Sorry. A generation having a significantly lower exposure to blood product is huge. I was born in the mid 80s and knew kids at camp with HIV or hepatitis and I myself was tested for HIV until 2004.\n\nI know the hematologists at my hospital have been working on gene therapy for A the last year, too. There is a nasal spray? First I have heard of it. Desmopressin can be helpful for people with mild deficiency, but you need to be probably 8% or higher for it to be meaningful. Not sure if that is what this person is speaking of. I think it is only for mild hemophilia, but still pretty cool In my lifetime, we have gone from plasma-derived factors to factors with incredible shelf lives and no trace of human blood product.\n\nOne year ago I was on Advate, 4000iu every other day. That is at least 180 infusions/year, plus whatever's needed for bleed control etc.\n\n10 months ago I switched to Adynovate. 4000iu every 3-4 days. If all goes well, that is about 120 infusions a year. A 30% drop! Do you have any idea how much easier that makes things?\n\n2 months ago I started the ACE910 trial. Less than 1cc, subcutaneous shot, once a week. And this is Phase III. It may not even be the best of the new drugs in the pipeline but it is sure as hell working for me.\n\nIf you think progress is not coming, I think you are blind. Yes, for you it is changed. \nFrom plasma to a trail. \nChange for you! \nI am not blind. I am just stating that nothing has changed for my son. \nLike I said other than product easier to make up  Yes, but people born in the 90s \nIt is man made factor 3 times a week. \n2017 it is still the same. \nI am not saying changes are not coming \nThey seem to be coming faster for some than others.\nThose \"selected\" for trails might be lucky enough to be on longer lasting factor. \nNot everyone was selected  The non factor bypassing agents are now in phase 1 clinical trials.  Gene therapy for factor 8 is in clinical trials.  Factor 9 gene therapy is in late stage clinical trials.  \n\nNon-first world countries have serious problems.  Even places like Belize have no hematology clinics treating hemophilia.  We need to keep working to get factor to third world countries as well as small first and second world countries.\n\n Based on your posting history you should probably be talking to a therapist instead of random internet people, because you clearly have a lot to unpack.\n\nYour boys have it as good as any hemophiliacs have had it, and within the next 5 or so years things will get so much better for them. Get your head out of your ass and have a bit of patience. You seem to think that being selected for a trial is some sort of upper-caste privilege given to the chosen bleeders.\n\nWe have to deal with months (years!) of doctor's visits, blood tests, electronic logging, possible restrictions on international travel (do you know how much paperwork you need to bring a trial medication overseas?), etc so that in 2-3 years, everyone else will be able to benefit from whatever medication we are on.\n\nShow some goddamned respect. Yes, but it has not changed in the past 20 years. Unless your on a trail Everything is always right around the corner. I have been hearing that for 20 years. \n I do not know how anyone can this. Look at the history of hemophilia, because of advancements I do not have to fear I could get tainted blood. Long lasting factor has improved drastically. Factor is more accesible to people. Gene therapy has already helped develop the possibility of subcutaneous shots. We are not treated the same. It is beyond ignorant and offensive to people who have passed from bad blood that we have just as shitty of treatment. Actually I know alot of hemophiliacs who have managed to go to 2 days, even one in some cases. Elocate and other long lasting factors are available. You can have your sons or whoever advocate to their hematologist to start that new factor.  Why are you seemingly incapable of properly responding to comments, or reading what we have to say? No. your wrong . \nI am not ignorant . You are not reading what I am saying correctly. \nI am saying in the past 20 years my sons treatment is no different! \nFactor given 3 times a week . \nHe is 20 &amp; had been on 3 times a week factor since he was 12 months old. \nNothing has changed. \nDo not call me beyond ignorant or being offensive to people who have passed away from tainted blood product.\nAgain just for you .... IM TALKING ABOUT THE LAST 20 years..... \ngeez . Settle down  And any advances in treatment like linger lasting are only available to people in a trail. Where I am it is seems to be the favourite families are being selected. \nFamilies who are pro active with haemophilia charters  I am not. I am not denying there are advances. BUT.... none have been any Benefit to my family. \nI am reading what your saying. I am even understanding it!!! \nFor a person who has been on 3 x weekly factor 8 for 20 years ... nothing has changed.\nAre you capable of understanding that??? \n  But when will these be available ? \nI am trying to say . \nAt the moment NOTHING has changed   I did not say you were, I said it is. You expect people to sympathize with you when you are mad about nothing. We all have this. I am sorry your son has suffered but everyone here has. The fact is, in this world for an average American, it has improved. If nothing has changed then why do we have long lasting factor? Which is a step up from normal factor. We did not have it twenty years ago. If you think nothing has changed you live in a bubble and/or are truly ignorant. Obviously everyone here disagrees, maybe the your feelings lie in some deep seeded trauma because there is the real world and what you want to believe. You have 20+ comments saying what the real world is. Settle down. Yes there has been. Factor is safer than it is ever been and you can get products like Adynovate today - not just in a trial but they are out in the market. Adynovate moved me from 3-4/week to 2-3/week. And within a couple years we will all be at 1/week or even less.\n\nThis sort of spoiled entitlement does not help anyone. You really have no clue how good you have it. THEY ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE. STOP BLATHERING AND READ. Fuck off dude. My brother is working with the red cross in third world countries doing good shit cuz his meds actually last now and he does not have to cart around a couple gallons of whole blood. You are being an edgy tool. I can function daily because my medicine works, I can compete at a semi pro level in a sport I could not as a hemophiliac otherwise. Shit I survived a car wreck that should have killed me cuz they could plug in a machine that kept factor on tap. None of that was viable twenty years ago. He is probably a drunk troll. You are a moron. No, I am totally unsurprised that a \"hemomom\" could be this willfully stupid. Great. Good on you. \nYour amazing . Give yourself s pat on the back . \n&amp; do not tell me to fuck off you nasty little shit  I never asked for anyone's symphony . \nJust saying it like it is for my son. \nPeople are so nasty. \nMake me feel like shit . \nWell done. \n Name calling is very immature! \nGrow up.  Yes, you older folk had it worse. \nWe keep hearing that. \nMy so called whiny garbage lol\nHas nothing to do with how you had it in the past. Not everything is about you  It is really nice having everyone who is an expert on treatment give me their feedback. \nI know there are improvements in treatment COMING. \nBut ATM my son is still on the same treatment he was in 20 years ago. \nIs that so hard for you all to understand? \nCalling me names is very childish . \nBut whatever. \nWhat a wonderful group of people you are. \n These people are very aggressive  And nothing is about you. You are just the carrier, not like you have to deal with anything. Why is not your adult son in here complaining about it? Probably because he does not have a problem with his treatment.\n\nSeek therapy. Hahahahahaha Because you came in here and put a medication on blast that is keeping all of us active and alive you fucking tool. You, ya fucking bitch. Yeah we all wish we where cured but unfortunately that has not happened. But we can live a normal life thanks to what we have, and you came in here trashing everything about it. Leave you ignorant troll. See this is why people hate all of these \"hemo mom\" groups. You are so toxic and full of anger you come in here insulting and trash talking like you are so special and will not listen to a single fucking word any of us said. Get the fuck off the Internet you crazy ass bitch and go back to your little snowflake Facebook groups. Good point, god those groups are so toxic. I just read the username, thank you.   \n\n Please educate yourself. \"Products in the Pipeline\" is a literal list of all new forthcoming products and one's that are in the trial phase. You know, hemophilia has been recorded for thousands of years, and we had to wait until the 1950s to have any sort of medical treatment for it. So in hindsight, our treatments have actually developed quite rapidly. \n\n For example, read the abstract (just the abstract alone...):  \"Changes in treatment strategies for severe haemophilia over the last 3 decades: effects on clotting factor consumption and arthropathy.\" Which states \"The annual number of joint bleeds decreased over the years. Arthropathy as measured by the Pettersson score generally became apparent around the age of 15 years and was lowest in patients treated with primary prophylaxis. In conclusion, clotting factor consumption has increased and **haemophilic arthropathy has decreased due to the intensification of treatment for severe haemophilia over the last 3 decades.** \"\n\nThe fact of the matter is having access to medication means a reduction in bleeds. We do not need to change our medication radically, we need consistent access to medication in order to keep bleeding under control. \n\nChange the way you think of things and everything will not seem so shitty. I know we have a rough go of it, but 30 or 40 years ago things we significantly worse than they are now.  Thank you  Yes I am just the carrier. \nI have no idea. \nI am just the person who has given everything for my children. \nI feel sorry for your mother. \nJust the carrier. Say that to her. \nYou are really a very nasty person. \n You have made me feel like total shit. \nYou misunderstood what I said. \nYour mother must be very proud of you. \nKnowing how you treat other mothers. \nI will just fuck off &amp; you keep going. \n Okay have a good life...", "Are your hands and/or feet colder than the average person? I have known for a really long time that my feet and especially my hands can become cold far more easily than the average person.\n\nTemperatures just under room temperature or washing my hands are the most common trigger.\n\nMy finger tips turn blue, my hands change colour to a mixture of red, purple and sometimes patches orange.\n\nI get eczema on my hands too, so I moisturize them every day with Aloe Vera to manage it\n\nI attributed my symptoms to being a keyboard warrior who is burnt off all the fat on his hands that would have otherwise kept them warm, but the more I read about this being a potential issue relating to blood pressure and blood flow, the more I wonder if there is a connection to Hemophilia (B in my case).\n\nAre there any other sufferers out there that can relate to this problem? Or anyone knowledgeable that may have some information on this? I also have hemophilia B and people constantly tell me my hands/feet are freezing. Not sure if it is connected. I think Raynaud\u2019s Syndrome can also cause this. I have hemophilia A and usually my hands and feet are freezing. However I do not think it is because of hemophilia.\n\nIn my case I got my thyroid removed due cancer, and I believe that is the reason. Hands are typically toasty, feet are icicles  Prob worth telling your doctor - there are other circulation conditions that would be more likely causes - like Raynaud\u2019s. \nAnd as much as the diet industry would like you to believe you can burn fat off one part of your body - that is not how it works! Hands and feet typically do not have much fat on them anyway \ud83d\ude09 My hands are always ice cold but no discoloration. Although they are always pretty pale but not as pale as those pictures of Raynaud\u2019s Syndrome.  My feet, on the other hand (ha), are either ice cold or burning up. Yep. Hemophilia B carrier...My husband calls it, \"The Icy Grip of Death\". Seriously...my hands are always cold! Reddit survey time? I am A and no freezing powers. I definitely have gotten the blue fingernails in the past, but I usually prefer to pump the A/C and throw on some layers so figured it was just self-inflicted.", "Hemlibra Questions So Hemlibra has been an absolute blessing as far as bleed management goes (Factor A Severe), but even on my every other week schedule, I am angry because I feel like a truck hit me for two days.  Do any of you all feel that way, too?  It is a godsend.  it really is.  But my every other Monday schedule makes me hate it because i honestly feel like I have the flu for at least 36 hours after I take it.  Am I alone?  All of our bodies are different. I am sorry to hear that friend. I have been on hemlibra for over a year and 0 side effects. Planning to start taking once a week soon. Good to know. I have not had such issues but I have been on weekly dowsed since I started. Definitely felt a bit of fatigue but not like you are describing. For me I am not sure if it is down to the treatment or having to deal with constant lockdowns \ud83e\udd28 You should mention that to your hematologist! I have had no such issues like that. You are not alone brother.  I feel it pretty bad for about 12 hours after but I drag ass for the next week.  I have been on it for less than a year so of course I was thinking it might be Covid related (even though I have not fallen ill). Had about a week delay getting my first dose in January because of slack response times between my doctor/pharmacy/insurance company and missing my scheduled dose let my levels fall enough to feel normal again.  I wondered if a smaller, weekly dose might help and I will be discussing options with at my HTC appointment in a month or so.  Not a single bleed since I have started taking it but I also did not get the other benefits people talked about (joints feeling better, feeling stronger, more active, etc..) but as long as I can maintain my usual activity levels I am happy enough but that has been a struggle.  Not as bad as you, but I am feeling similar effects.  I am a bigger guy (210 pounds) so I wonder if the higher dose may play a roll?  I would like to find a way to make it work without the side effect of feeling worn out. I am about to start Monthly doses after doing weekly, so I will look out for the same effect.\n\nI wonder if these side-effects could be dealt with by taking half the dose one day, and the other half the following day.\n\nBut definitely talk to your HTC team first. I have been almost 3 years with Hemlibra. First using a dose a week, now monthly. And no, I would never experience those symptoms. Actually  I used to exercise really hard the day I receive the dose. Thanks for the responses, everyone.\n\n\"Flu\" may not be the right term, because I can still function.  It is like a hangover.  Fatigue, headache, hot flashes, and achy joints like I ran a mile the day before all hit me.\n\nI will bring these up to my HTC.  They are all on the list of side effects, so it is not rare for this to happen.  From what I am hearing, I may just not be in the norm.  \n\nI will say I am terrible about getting it on my skin, and I get no adverse reactions from it like most do other than the annoyance of something sticky lol I had some similar side effects when I was on the bi monthly schedule- sore joints mostly. So I switched to the weekly dosing and my body tolerates it fine now. The idea being that it is less medicine weekly, so it is not such a big immune response all at once every two weeks or every month. Plus it is easier for me to remember to do it every week, and if the insurance screws up and I do not get it exactly on the day I should it is not as big of a deal because the half-life is so long, and they still send a months worth (4 doses) every month. So the likelihood of missing a dose is cut in half as well. But the main reason I switched to weekly is so I do not have to take as much all at once, I felt like my body was having too strong of an immune response and my joints were sore from it. Weekly has been great. It still does not stop all bleeds for me but I bleed a lot less than before.", "Looking for people diagnosed with hemophilia to join our research panel and participate in paid research studies  US residents only.

", "Novo taps bluebird bio for gene-editing tech  Interesting! Looked in to Bluebird a fair bit during an internship many years ago... I cannot seem to spot any specific mention of haemophilia in their pipeline according to their website at the moment. I am assuming this will not take long to be updated. Will be interesting to see what conversations the community have about gene editing given all the gene therapy \"hype\" at the moment!", "A question for those who are using Hemlibra Hi everyone,\n\nOnly today I found out that this subreddit exists, super cool!\nI have Severe Haemophilia A and have had since birth (genetic mutation). As of a couple days ago Hemlibra is now an option to Haemophilics in Ireland, and I am excited to try it asap.\nHowever I have a hesitation in adopting, and forgive me because I know entirely it is a \"first world problem\". In the description of Hemlibra it states that it must be refrigerated and can only be outside a fridge for 7 days. \nThis would be a change for me as my elocta generally sits beside my bed most always. The reason I am concerned is that I am hugely into the rock climbing scene and this had led me to occasions where I would be away from home and consistent refrigeration for over the \"7 days\" and sometimes greater than a month. \nWhat I am asking in a long-winded manner is, has anyone who has used Hemlibra had similar occasions where refrigeration is difficult/not an option? Has/can the medication be effective if unrefrigerated?\n\nThank you! I take my Hemlibra dose once monthly, there is also bi weekly or weekly options, but I like the freedom of once a month. So it could definitely fit your schedule. As for making the switch I would 100% do it all again. I have had zero problems. \n\nAfter seven days as I understand it the medicine becomes way less effective and they recommend the product never exceeding the seven days unrefrigerated. So anything over that would be bad. \n\nAlso to note the first four weeks you take loading doses to build it up in your system, so once a week the first month that you switch. Oh interesting! I would for sure take it the most infrequent option. Are there any drawbacks to once a month? Like an lower average clotting or a clotting level too high straight after injecting? \nBummer about the refrigeration but definitely not the worst. Thanks for the info! So you mean to tell us that even as a severe hemophiliac you are regularly spending 4+ weeks rock climbing without access to a fridge?\n\n&gt;What I am asking in a long-winded manner is, has anyone who has used Hemlibra had similar occasions where refrigeration is difficult/not an option? \n\nProbably not TBH, the medication's only been out there for 18 months or so.\n\nI was not even allowed to carry it unrefrigerated for short periods during the clinical trial - had to fly with a cooler filled with ice packs, was given instructions on how to pack it and everything. Hemlibra basically pushes your 'equivalent clotting level' up to 10-15%, so it is not sending you into the 150% range that a factor infusion would.\n\nMuch like w/ factor, there is a trough at the end of the dose period - so for example if you are taking it weekly, your numbers will dip a little at the end of the week and you might be more vulnerable to a bleeding episode. If you are taking it monthly, they will dip a bit at the end of the month. In the end you are experiencing the same length of trough, the question is how do you want to split it up.\n\nThere is also the issue of how big the doses are (which depends on your body weight) and how well your body deals with higher concentrations - some people have not dealt with 4-week doses well and gone with weekly doses as a result. Ah I see, had not considered that. Do you think 10-15% +(1~2%) would cover a pretty active lifestyle? Elocta has thankfully covered me for most all my sport related bangs and bruises. I also had inhibitors when I was a kid, do you know if these could interact with Hemilibra? It has been life changing! Definitely consider it. I am more active than I have ever been. I am a severe factor 8, I just turned 35 and I feel like I am 25! I am very lucky in that I have only had a handful of joint bleeds in my life (touch wood) and so far it has not held me back in sports (minus like rugby). Not regularly, sadly, but last summer I was away from Ireland for 6 weeks with a large portion of it centred around rock climbing. So the refrigeration part did make me consider for that reason.\nOoo 1-2 days? Dam, I remember those icepacks from using Advate as a kid. Huge respect for adopting it in trials btw! Hemlibra was originally developed as a treatment for inhibitor patients - until they found it worked well with everyone!\n\nIf you are severe and taking Eloctate every 3-4 days, in that period you are swinging back and forth from 100%+ to 0% (how quickly depends on your survival rate). That is why you need to infuse so often, to reduce the amount of time you spend in the danger zone.\n\nIf you are on Hemlibra, it means you are pretty much constantly at 10-15% all the time, which is the equivalent of a mild hemophiliac, which means that in theory you could do a lot of sporty stuff without having to worry. You can still infuse before a period of increased physical activity (or right after you have done something dumb and hurt yourself) and that *should* help you recover without affecting the hemlibra in your system.\n\nI cannot make any promises about how well the drug will work with your lifestyle - that is something you have got to sound out on your own because only your body knows how it will interact with a new drug. Absolutely take it easy during the loading phase. Ah wow!  That is great news. \nAh I see, recently I went and did my pharmakinetics and got a half live of 24hrs, with injections yup every 3-4 days. By that maths though the lowest I would normally get to on elocta would be the constant for Hemlibra right? \nIs the loading phase tough on your body? Fair enough! Lucky you.\n\nIf you are away for 6 weeks you could see, for example, if you could arrange for a local HTC/hospital/clinic to hold onto your dose until you need it. It is not particularly tough, you just have to be more mindful because your body will be in a slightly more vulnerable spot without Eloctate. Maybe stick to indoor climbing for a couple weeks ;-) That is a good point! Exciting times to be alive :) Ah yes! The weather will be too cold and wet for anything else so you are too right :D For me personally, it was that period of like... for example taking a stair wrong and tweaking your ankle, and fighting back the urge to rush home and push Adynovate because you know otherwise you are going to get a bleed.\n\nThis may not apply to you since it sounds like you are in pretty sturdy shape, but the loading phase is about building up your Hemlibra level and learning to trust it. Really? My specialist said that servers could only do it once a week or bi weekly. He said there is not enough data suggesting it is effective once a month or something and I read a fair bit of data backing that up. I am not using it but I am starting it next Tuesday and I cannot wait. Feel free to PM me with any questions when I am on it. This is amazing info. I am so jealous for everyone who has been able to make the switch. I am currently having issues getting my Eloctate approved by the insurance company. Hemlibra is a fight that will have to wait. Are you an inhibitor patient? I wonder if they cannot do monthly.\n\nI took it weekly during the clinical trial and switched to monthly once it was approved here - no issues after 1 year. No history of inhibitors or anything. There is a pretty good chance it will be good for longer than 7 days.\n\nBut the way clinical trials work is they do it all completely refrigerated, then slowly do studies on how long it is good for outside of the fridge, and get that piece approved. It can take a long time for those studies. Hi  interesting you ask this question, I am a Haemophillia living in Ireland also and having read these threads I was thinking if it had become available in Ireland yet, as none of my consultants or anything have mentioned it.

I happened to have developed a severe case of synovitis in my knee due to constant bleeds over the last 15 years, which basically means that my knee remains a bit swollen all the time. I was hence advised to undergo radiosynovectomy which I did recently, in fact just a week ago. However, after the treatment, my knee seems to be a bit more swollen than usual. I was informed that this might happen, but I guess 7 days is a long period now.

You never know - maybe you will find something with a bit more reasonable barrier for entry than law enforcement. My degree is in math and I have had several crime fighting jobs. My first job was an analyst at a bank dealing in prepaid credit cards. I was in charge of developing the algorithms for catching money laundering and fraud activity.

Nice to feel special, but is there anyone with any real-life experience of raising a child with BSS?  My son is 16 months old and has had 8 life-threatening nosebleeds already. Each one was only stopped with a platelet concentrate infusion. He is just been diagnosed, but our haematologist is fairly clear about the fact that there is no actual treatment except for infusion at bleeding events.  \n\nCannot find any actual affected humans who I can talk to about it. How are we supposed to live? What is the prognosis? Are there any specialists working on it?\n\nHello? Anyone out there?\n\n   I have no experience with hemophilia but I wanted to say I am so sorry that you are going through such a terrible experience, I cannot imagine the stress and pain you must be feeling about everything that is going on now, and especially about the future.  I hope you and your son have everything you need, and that you receive the support you deserve. I do not understand how the nosebleeds could have been life threatening, but it looks like BSS can be treated with factor VIIa which should prevent major bleeds. \n\nAssuming you are in the States or a Western European country or Japan, getting in contact with your state's/district's Hemophilia Treatment Center should be your first step and most states have nonprofit Hemophilia outreach groups. They will help you.  I 100% agree with the other recommendation to find your nearest HTC. Based on your spelling of 'haematologist', I am betting you are not based in the US so these hemophilia treatment centers may be called something else where you live. Figure out if there is a national hemophilia or bleeding disorders foundation in your country, go to their website and see if there is a list of doctors who specialize in bleeding disorders. My family has had lots of trouble working with hematologists who do not specialize in bleeding disorders. Non-specialized hematologists generally focus on hematology-oncology and are not equipped to connect patients to specialized resources. Personally and anecdotally, hematologists who do not specialize in bleeding disorders have missed certain comorbidities which are common to patients with bleeding disorders (such as joint damage) and were not able to connect my family to the training, specialized pharmacy, in-home nursing, and other resources that have greatly improved my family's lives with hemophilia. I am no expert on BSS, but infusing platelet concentrate is not much different from infusing factor and the bleeding episodes would probably be very similar. \n\nAll that aside, we see you and we hear you and you are not alone. Living with any bleeding disorder can be tough and scary at times, but there are plenty of people who have experience and can guide you through it. There is likely even a local chapter of a hemophilia or bleeding disorders group in your area. These groups will have tons of resources for parents of kids with bleeding disorders. Try to connect to one of these groups for the personal and emotional support that it provides. \n\nBetween a hemophilia/bleeding disorders treatment center, national foundation, or local chapter, you will start to formulate a game plan. Eventually you will probably learn how to infuse the medication (platelets or otherwise) for your child and when he gets older he will start to learn how to do it himself. Here in the US there are summer camps for kids with bleeding disorders where they learn these skills starting around age 7. Starting an IV on your kid is massively stressful, your local chapter or a Facebook support group can be a big help here. Until you get these skills down, you may want to organize with the local hospital to make sure they have the specific medication your son needs. If it is just platelets for now, this should not be too difficult, but if he gets put on a specialty drug it can be hard to find a hospital which has the right one in stock at their pharmacy. (This can be an issue for patients who use biologics since not all brands work the same in individuals) If you have trouble working with your local hospital, you might want to find a specialty pharmacy which can send specialty drugs to your home and which has a nurse on call who can visit your home to infuse for you (we use Accredo). Again, this is all based on my own experience from living in the US, your medical system might just be better equipped. \n\nThere are researchers looking into in vivo genomic editing for other genetic disorders (the specialists are definitely working on it). There might not be a \"cure\" right now for BSS, but as long as you have meaningful access to timely treatment there should be little difference in the quality or quantity of life when compared to the general population. You got this!  My daughter is 7 with BSS. And yes, nosebleeds can be life threatening. I can tell you that from experience. Factor VII can be used, but is not effective for all patients. When she gets nosebleeds we use Amicar. The only treatment guaranteed to work is platelet transfusion. There is a Facebook group for Bernard Soulier. You can connect with other patients/parents.", "Benefix to Idelvion? (Hemophilia B) Hey guys, I have been following this subreddit for a while now and it is very nice to have such a welcoming community! I have Hemophilia B (factor 9) and am thinking of switching up my medication. I have been on Benefix for 20 years, only medication I have ever been on. Considering switching to something with a longer half-life as I would like to do things as I please...I am sure most of you can relate. I am very hesitant in switching because of possible inhibitors. Also, I was wondering the difference between albumin and albumin free medications and why this is such a big deal. I understand it helps to increase half life and is naturally produced in the body, but I am just not sure why some of these medications boast about being albumin free and some are proud of using it. Any recommendations or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!! (P.s. sorry for rambling.) My understanding is that albumin is used keep proteins, like factor, from sticking to the insides of bottles, syringes and tubing.\n\nI think it used to be the case that products claimed to be albumin free because albumin was derived from pooled blood donations.  So it did not make much sense to have a recombinant product that was free of pooled blood-derived proteins packaged with the exact thing you are trying to avoid.\n\nIt looks like Idelvion has figured out how to make recombinant albumin so there is no risk of any pathogen transmission associated with donated blood.\n\nFor what it is worth I was pretty happy when I switched from Benefix to Alprolix.  Alprolix binds FIX protein to an antibody to extend halflife, whereas Idelvion binds FIX protein to albumin. I switched from rixubis to idelvyion. For the most part it is been a great experience Thanks for all the info! That makes total sense about the albumin, I just never really thought of it from that perspective. What made you choose Alprolix over other medicines? Also did you consider Idevion in search for the right medication? Any negative aspects of switching? Or anything you dislike about it now? I was able to get into the clinical trial for Alprolix before it was approved by the FDA.  I think it was the first extended halflife product brought to market.  So there were not any other choices when I switched.  When Idelvion was approved I did look into it since it appears to have a longer halflife than Alprolix.  But, from what I could tell at the time, it did not seem like the difference in halflife was worth the higher price of Idelvion. You have been a big help and given me some things to think on, I appreciate your time and information. I am also severe and only been on benefix but it is honestly just time for a change. No problem.  I am sure it will be a big improvement no matter which one you pick.  Does your HTC have any thoughts on the switch?  They may want to do a PK study to determine what dosing schedule would be best for you. I have not spoken with them just yet, I wanted to gather more information about what all is available first. One of my specialty pharmacy employees spoke to me about Idelvion specifically, and they are really not the kind to push medications on me to turn a profit, I have known them a very long time. They just mentioned that it could be a good fit for me and to look into if it peaked my interest. And honestly I have been growing tired of the repeated double dose infusions, especially seeing how I have had a few major bleeds recently. Really not sure how insurance would play out but if it has a profound difference from how I am now it would probably be worth it. Hey, I have had a few bleeds which required a boost in those cases I have used a standard half life product. Otherwise idelvyion has been a refreshing change to my previous infusion schedule Would you say it does as good of a job of preventing bleeds as a standard half-life type of product on prophylaxis? 90% of the time, yes. I had to treat an acute bleed w/ standard half life. That is been once in the past 2 years", "Moderate A and alcohol comsumption I have moderate (3-5%) hemophilia a and have been having far more problems in the last few months then ever before.  I have been drinking beer more regularly as well.  2-4 a night.

It is a long story and I hope one day to share my story with reddit! \n\nBut yes I agree alcohol never helped me and when I did not drink my bleeds halved!  I would love to hear more about the gene therapy sometime!  Hell yeah! Congrats on the therapy.  I am sure a lot of people on this sub would like to hear your story! It is been a rough ride I tell you but going for injecting every other day minimum to reaching 6months with out factor next Tuesday it is been worth it all! I would say to anyone it is not a physical battle, it is mental, pushing your body or intact just living your life and not receiving a bleed is something one day I hope all haemophiliacs feel!

It feels like the guy who is spread so much terrible information about universal healthcare and protections for preexisting conditions is a traitor to his fellow hemophiliacs.  How could he work for the Reagan administration while hemophiliacs were dying through infected clotting factor...while Reagan did nothing? Not only did nothing, but joked about it...just when I could not think any less of a person. \n\n Not quite true.  The CDC cracked the infection pathway about 6 months after AIDS first  became prominent.  They met with the Reagan admin, the ARC, the NHF, and the Gay Men's Health Crisis group (proto Act Up).  The CDC gave their data and recommended keeping IV drug users and gay men out of the blood supply.  Fearing a drop in donations, the Red Cross objected, fearing expensive factor (recall that plasma derived factor had an AWP of 3-5 cents per unit then), the NHF blocked it.  The Gays threatened civil disobedience which caused the ARC to get even more opposed.  The Reagan admin should have called their bluff, but did not.  They  caved because they knew that the ARC and NHF would not back them up and the Reagan bashing media would instantly come out against him.\n\nThe left and the NHF and the AIDS activists have blood on their hands.   Wow...the fact that he had hemophilia is incredible upsetting.  I do not want him to be a part of our club.  He must have been mild, right?  Any discussion of AIDS or Hep C?\n\n He kept his hemophilia pretty close to the vest.  Not known if it was A or B.  Severity status is also not clearly known.   Based on the little information I know about his life I have to imagine it was very mild.   Could be wrong though.  ( Condolences to Roger Ailes's  family!  Wonder if Roger Ailes was on a clinical trial for a new hemophilia therapy such as ACE 910? The hemophilia community is very diverse and many people have different political views. There are people that do appreciate his amazing journey with a bleeding disorder. It is not uncommon for people of his generation to not be involved with the foundations because they know the history of NHF and consider this organization to have blood on their hands. \nStill NHF and HFA should have acknowledged this man and publically sent condolences to his family. Not everybody in the bleeding disorders community has the same political view point regarding healthcare.  Why is that?   Is there something that the foundations know that we do not know?", "First tattoo done on Hemlibra. Finished.  boognish! Is hemlibra available in Australia?

I have been wanting a tattoo for awhile now. The only thing I did on that day was my own weekly Hemlibra dose.  I did not prep in the slightest otherwise Just finished my loading doses, still at the hospital.\n\nHemlibra is amazing. Are you on weekly, bi weekly or monthly? I have seen people on the Haemophilia Society UK Facebook who have had tattoos even just in Factor, they just load up before and after, and have a good chat with the artist beforehand.\n\nPersonally, I am waiting for the disposable income to seriously think about it. I say trust yourself, you know your body, go for it. I am hearing good things about Hemlibra, having recently said I would stick to Factor for a while longer. Is it that big of a difference?\n\nI declined it for now as I do not see the point in having that but still needing my current factor in case of emergencies, and was put off by the one-week limit without refrigeration vs. 6 months or so with NovoEight. Personally I love it and it is making a major diffrence.\n\n I am Severe, and I have noticed the diffrence. Even after my initial loading dose (its not as effective for the first 3 weeks) I feel down a flight of stairs drunk and walked away without so much as a bruise.\n\nIt keeps your factor levels so much higher that you do not have to worry about anywhere near as much.\n\nThe once a week thing is a huge bonus as well, I was getting really fed up of taking IV every 3 days when I was on Elocta Extended Half life.\n\nThe other really neat thing is it is a sub cut, really quick, easier injection. Rather than an IV injection that will also damage your veins. I am Severe too, so that is good to hear. Not the falling, the being okay.\n\nI am on every other day so even more frequently than you, maybe I will look back into it I have mild hemophilia and I have got 2 tattoos. I asked my doctor and they recommended that I take factor beforehand. Later, they said I should be fine without anything. My arm tattoo was fine. No problems at all. I had slight issues with my knee. My leg was hurting for a little while afterwards. I did omit the fact that I have hemophilia in feast that they would refuse to do it. Which you probably should not do. I have never omitted it.

Assuming it works and prevents bleeds to that degree, the idea of 'your body' doing this was interesting to me.  \n\nI am curious if anyone else has thought of it this way and what that means to you?  Is it just the results that matter, or is this part important too? Severe VIII A here...\n\nI am currently a candidate to receive gene therapy though my trial has been repeatedly delayed (I signed up in 2018). I must admit I have not heard anything from my doctors about any time limit on the therapy's effectiveness. Gene therapy does not alter your DNA when you produce new cells, it just alters the cells in a localized area for as long as those cells are around. So if it is in your liver, I suppose it would last until all the affected liver cells are replaced. IANAD I could be wrong. However, the treatment takes several procedures over an extended period of time so I do not see why it could not be done at a later point if your initial therapy wore out. \n\nThe biggest points for me that made me want to sign up are how few risks and how little of a lifestyle change this would be for me. I like factor because I like the total control of it. I am an active person, so I like being able to factor up before hiking or skiing and knowing that I am fairly well protected. This is why I have not switched to HemLibra as the threshold regularly falls around 30%. With gene therapy, there is no assurance what my own body-produced threshold would be higher than that, however, if I needed to I could always supplement it with factor. \n\nThe risks that I have been informed of are minimal. While many patients in the early trails failed to produce any factor or a threshold above 5%, one patient began to produce over 200% of standard. This actually became a health risk for him and he now takes treatment for thrombosis. The other issue that I have been told is a very very minimal risk of the virus-vehicle affecting the RNA and creating a cancer risk. I have been told this has not been observed in any of the trials but it is theoretically possible. \n\nThe greatest benefit is one that is honestly the most mundane, but still quite important. As a hemophilia patient on longer-lasting factor-based regiment, there are 1-3 days a week where I could be between 0-5% depending on how prompt I am about factoring up the day I need it. My factor lasts about 5 days which I have always found to be difficult to keep track of when I need to infuse so sometimes I am late, and even when I am not my threshold is incredibly low the last couple days. During that time is when I am most at risk for a spontaneous brain bleed, which is something that truly terrifies me. Having a regular threshold of between 10-30% would at least mean I would have one less thing to worry about, and would almost completely alleviate spontaneous bleeds of any kind, plus I could still factor up for big activities. \n\nThe science is not new. it is almost 15 years old at this point and the trials that have already been underway have given plenty of data to suggest it could be a mainstream option within 5 years. Whether or not it will be affordable... that is the real question, and honestly... that is why I signed up to be a candidate. Factor VIII Severe A.  We are all waiting on the magic bullet and this seems to be the closest to a \"cure\" so were all watching and waiting.  Unfortunately for me, being in my mid-40s now, the damage is done so I am more excited about viable ankle/elbow replacements.  Already did my knees and am at the end of their expected lifespan.  The hard part with gene therapy for parents would be when/if to pull the trigger.  Given your child a \"normal\" childhood or wait and give it a shot to cover their more dangerous teen years?  Or not at all, and wait to see if a permanent solution pops up later?  There is no right or wrong answer but you have got to consider all of your options and hope you do not sabotage a future option.  I am still on Recombinant so I am not exactly the kind of person that jumps on the new treatment bandwagon.  I will wait and see how the pioneers handle it for now.  On the other hand, I am willing to try out a new prosthetic joint to make life easier in the meantime.  It all really comes down to the individual and what they need most. No offense meant but after my own experiences with factor companies and salespeople, I have zero trust for anyone but my HTC and even then I know the only reason I am alive is because it is in someone is financial interest for me to receive treatment.\n\nAny cure or long term treatment will almost certainly include some form of debt equivalent to indentured service, so I am not hoping for that. A more effective hemlibra or similar medication that keeps me alive and with a good quality of life, while keeping the med companies pockets lined enough for it to be in their interest is all I hope for and all I want. If I could do an injection or a pill even once a day that kept me at 100%, that is my \u201ccure.\u201d\n\nThe only real hope of a real cure is to be fortunate enough to be born into a country with social medicine and a crispr treatment that changes my dna. I did some marketing research with a major pharma company last month, looking into similar things this person is. They told me currently, most gene therapy use the same method of delivery. There is still not a for sure way to tell how long it will last, and bc most use the same method, for now, it is basically a 1 time thing.\n\nThey were specifically interested in how they could convince others with hemophilia to take that risk, when the product launches.\n\nAnother big thing they seemed concerned with as well, is insurance. Bc being temporarily \"cured\" of something, can potentially cause huge issues with insurances, etc, when they eventually have to go back to factor. There is more than enough resources that you can find  that can answer your question.  Going to patients for your own benefit is not what this subreddit is about This seems like an overreaction to someone who was upfront that their interest is not for current commercial gain.  Besides, they are asking about patients' attitudes regarding products that will be a radical departure from anything seen previously in chronic disease treatment.  The best way to do that is to talk to patients. I think there should be a line drawn. This is a group for patients, caregivers, family members and friends wanting to learn more.   What happens down the road when G.T gets bigger?  you want industry execs coming in wanting info for their own gain?  Kudos to OP for disclosing, but I have seen this happen in other message boards and it gets out of hand. I want to respect the group, feel free to delete this if that is the consensus TIL gene therapy only lasts 3-10 years. At this point it is a known unknown.  We will not know until it stops working (or does not) for the people who have already been treated.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a paper about FIX patients treated with GT in ~2011:\n&gt; (\n\nAnother known unknown is whether all products will have the same durability.  The data available for Valrox (BioMarin) appear to show gradually declining FVIII activity levels over time.  That is a different result than the FIX example mentioned above. Why is it a one use only product? Even when made by different companies. It is one use only because this current generation of GT products are based on adeno-associated viruses.  The good FVIII or FIX gene is packaged into an AAV which infects a liver cell, transferring the gene.  Once your body is exposed to the AAV it develops neutralizing antibodies to defend against future exposures to the virus.  Treating more than once with the same AAV would more than likely be ineffective.\n\nYour second question is a good one.  There is a whole family of AAV viruses and different companies are using different ones.  I do not know whether neutralizing antibodies for AAV8 would also defeat AAV5.\n\nI think solving the neutralizing antibodies problem is already a hot research topic.", "Xyntha Approved for Routine Prophylaxis in Hemophilia A  Interesting.. I have been using it for prophy for years now lol   LOL do BeneFix next!", "Factor VII (hemophilia A or classic) i am 19, female, i was diagnosed with Factor VII disorder (hemophilia A or classic hemophilia) its very rare and none of the doctors in the united states know anything about it. I have severe menstrual bleeding that will last months, nose bleeds, etc. I do not have insurance because you know medical insurance is up there in prices. I am not sure what else there is to do, after being on almost every birth control in the book for the periods, NOTHING seems to be helping. Does anyone else share this disorder with me? or is it just me?! HELP Hemophilia A is Factor VIII deficiency. Did you type it incorrectly or do you have Factor VII deficiency because there is a night and day difference between the two. One is incredibly rare regardless of gender ( factor seven ) and the other ( factor eight ) is the most common among males. There are places you can go called hemophilia treatment centers that can potentially help you a lot. It is hard for females to find doctors that even believe they can have Hemophilia as it is considered rare. I know a lot about A ( eight ) if you have that. If not, I know a few non profits that deal with women who have bleeding disorders I think. i believe i typed it wrong. i have factor VII was diagnosed about 4 years ago Seven is  rare as you already know. I will see if I can find links to some organizations that could help you. What state are you in? There should be a Hemophilia treatment center that could help you out. No one should have to go through bleeds, so I will do my best to help. I am in nebraska, thank you oh so much!! Hey I take it back. Apparently it is common. I am severe A and thought I knew more than I did lol. A center should definitely be able to help you.  \n\nHere is a link to the center with contact info etc. \n\nStill looking for other organizations. \n\n\nI reccomend contacting them and seeing what advice they offer. As a man, I have had a difficult time my entire life finding adequate doctors and help with my disease, and I know from friends that being a female with a bleeding disorder can be even more challenging. Just know that you are not alone and there are people that will help you who have and are stilling living it with you!!! thanks so much! I have heard of drug companies that make factor running charities that will cover the cost of treatment. Someone else might be able to give you more information. I will see what I can find out and let you know. Is there a local hemophilia foundation? They might have some resources as well. Von Willebrand's disorder organizations would have more experience dealing with the hurdles women with coagulation disorders face. They are still very much considered men's issues in many ways.\nSomewhat related, someone else with FVII deficiency posted here a few months ago. I have not seen anything else from them but you are not alone!\nOne thing you may or may not have tried that has helped me with nosebleeds (and is indicated for heavy menstrual bleeding specifically) is tranexamic acid, brand name Lysteda. It is available as a generic drug, and a relatively cheap one. I wound up paying cash for it because it is cheaper than my co-pay would be. I am Haemophilia A and can vouch that Tranexamic Acid (Cyklokapron) is essential for nose bleeds - if it is minor, it will resolve by just taking it, otherwise a cocktail of Factor VIII and Tranexamic Acid is needed. Had not had much luck just relying on Factor VIII.\n\nAnd my Tranexamic Acid is not Lysteda brand. I do not know about your country, but in my, we have something called Cyklokapron. They are basic pills, and they help m (Hemophilia A severe) a lot for reducing nose bleeds occurrences and bruises. \n\nMy girlfriend even takes some because she has serious menstruations issues, so i would definately take a look at it. Even without insurances it should not cost you much, about 30 dollars a month.\n\nIf that does not fit in your budget at all, private message me and we will work it out. \n\nGood luck :) Are you in the US? Cyclokapron is off the market here (or else only available as an injectible). I get generic tranexamic acid 650 mg tablets and they are such an improvement over Amicar/aminocaproic acid - it baffles me that Amicar is still the standard antifibrinolytic prescribed for bleeders here. Tranexamic acid is better in every way.\nTranexamic acid tablets (generic Lysteda) are only FDA-approved for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. If you live near a Planned Parenthood clinic or a women's health care clinic that operates on a sliding scale, OP, they should be able and willing to prescribe it without any hassle. I am using the Pfizer Tranexamic Acid pills. Not in NA now.\n\nThe two names due to hearing them used interchangeably in the 101 times I had been admitted to hospital. I mean this seriously.\n\nSince you are only 19, consider moving to another country, and becoming a citizen. Obvious by 'another country' I mean a country with a nationalised health system. poop, i do not have the money! but i will look into it I have haemophilia A, and I was born in England, lived here all my life.\n\nI have always worried about how things would have gone if I would been born an American. You know, one of those illogical fears that keeps popping its head up from time to time.\n\nI wish I could do something more positive to help you. If you think I could help you, message me. yeah, health care is near $500 a month.. which is NOT something i can afford, i do not really know how anyone can afford it here. Thanks! i will! My 9 year old daughter has this too. \n\nYou need Amicar tablets and Novoswvwn infusions. It is expensive.\n\nIf you do not have insurance apply for a state medical program or ACORN. \n\nHave you been to the Factor VII retreats with CHES? It is free all expenses including travel paid.\n\nYou need a hematologists and contact your local Hemophilia Resource Center. i do not qualify for any kind of assistance in nebraska, i have applied for food stamps and every kind of medical insurance help and they will not give me any because i make 1,200 a month yet my rent is $850 a month. ALONE, and they still will not give me any. Contact CHES immediately. Hope to see you at the next retreat in November (Austin, Texas)\n\nAcorn is still an option for you I believe. The Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land.  You can receive a subsidy to reduce the amount of your monthly premium.  You are eligible for a subsidy even if your income is up to $48560/year.\n\nHere is an online calculator to plug in your own numbers:\n( A possibly less difficult idea would be to move to a state the implemented Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Speaking as someone loving in another country, you do not have to become a citizen to get healthcare - just a resident.\n\nStep 1: be employable overseas\n\nStep 2: do that\n\nStep 3: receive healthcare The Nebraska Hemophilia Treatment Center is at UNMC.  (402) 559 5600. Amicar is less potent than Tranexamic acid.  Tranexamic acid has a long and storied history of not being available.  Now it is.  Lysteda is the brand name.  It can be compounded into a nose spray or a high potency liquid for kids.  It is increasingly used in kids, but in women, it is so powerful that it cannot be used when estrogen containing OCPs are used due to a thrombosis risk. Give a call to Nebraska\u2019s HTC.  They have financial counselors and social workers as well as an adult nurse coordinator who can get you plugged into resources. For me, the best things about tranexamic acid are the potency and the smell/taste compared to Amicar. That rancid, putrid goat smell still makes me gag, and the 8 pill doses around the clock were so nasty that I would just infuse instead despite the hassle.\nTranexamic acid? No smell, 2 tablets 3 times a day and that is that. The best thing I have found for heavy periods is the Nuvaring. It is helped me go from monthly ER trips for ffp to like 3 days of \u201cnormal\u201d bleeding where I do not need to pack extra clothes for whenever I leave the house. we tried it and my bleeding pushed it out multiple times Holy crap! That is intense! it is, and beyond frustrating if i am being totally honest\ud83d\ude2d Girl I feel you. Hang in there. This is a crazy thing to have. I was diagnosed 8 years ago and still know nothing. right, we went a good 6-7 years of testing, multiple hospital stays, everything under the sun for them to figure out i even had it. ONE obgyn was doing research and came across factor 7, so they brought me in and decided to send me to the nearest children\u2019s hematologist and that is how we found out. It is frustrating that a lot of doctors in the US do not know much about at all. Tell me about it. It drives me nuts. I found out I had it when I had my tonsils taken out at 22. My blood levels were off so they sent me to a hematologist and told me it looks like I probably have cancer. Thank god it was only a clotting disorder. Certainly no doc in California knows what the hell this is all about. Every doc I have seen has had to read up on it and cannot tell me much. Might I ask which all countries would that be? :| I legit cannot tell if you are asking where non-citizens can get socialized medicine, because the answer is \u201canywhere that offers socialized medicine.\u201d\n\nWhether or not those countries have infrastructure to meet the needs of hemophiliacs is another question. In earlier comments I mentioned Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act.  \n\nIt turns out that voters in Nebraska \\( ( ) in November 2018 to implement Medicaid expansion in the state.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems as if the governor and some in the legislature do not want the expansion to be \\( ( Mee! I have Factor 7 DEF. I am so unbelievably thrilled somebody else who is a young adult has it too, and you are female! Like me!\n\nOh, oops: 23F with too many health issues to count.\n\nI have had some major issues with my menstrual. I have to be on a *very* specific birth control pill, and I have to skip the placebo week. I am not allowed to have normal menstration.\n\nNow, I have never have joint bleeds but I do have severe and progressive rheumatoid arthritis. Bit of a chicken and an egg thing because there is a possibility of my swelling/inflammation covering up any bleeding that is not extreme. \n\nI will say my hematologist treats me like a science experiment, especially when my results come back normal during testing, but not normal during others. \n\n\nDo not get in car crashes. You will bleed internally, and its some of the biggest risks with crashes aside from spinal injuries. Interesting. I never knew women could have Hemophilia. I thought they were only the carriers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as the menstrual bleeds, what about, and I apologize for butchering the description here, that t-valve you can get? I have an ex girlfriend that had one and it made it so she would never get her period. my parents both have to carrie the gene of the factor VII, none of my other siblings got it. i will speak with my doctor about that! thank you!! it is very rare in females OH MY GOSH HI!!! nice to finally meet someone!! pm me! \ud83d\ude0a Have you called yet?  The nurse coordinator for the adult service had not heard from you yesterday. My 13yr old niece was just diagnosed with inherited Factor vii deficiency after her 4th menstrual period led to needing a transfusion/novoseven. Her mom states they are trying different OCP because the initial ones did not do much to prevent her cycle. Can you share which pill worked for you?\n\nThis is very new to our family and so rare that my sister is overwhelmed and frustrated trying to find answers for her daughter. I take the Syeda birth control pill, and I skip the placebo week and continue onto the next packet. I still sometimes get PMS symptoms, but midol takes care of that easily. \n\nTry to find out her INR levels. Mine hovers at 1.9-2. I am considered therapeutic for strokes and blood clots, etc. My disorder is \"mild\", so I have never had a joint bleed and never had to have replacement factor. \n\nWith a higher INR level, she is more likely to bruise or have joint bleeds. So knowing her range is important to determining if she can do sports and the like. If she has a higher INR then what I said mine is, then suggest non-contact sports. Keep her as active as you can.\n\nAlso: be warned that her having children in the future can be very dangerous with a Factor VII deficiency. It can lead to bleeding during the pregnancy, miscarriage, or death upon birth for both mom and child. If she wants babies in the future then she needs to have a close team monitoring her. Just something to pass on to her mom. They might not bring it up because she is so young. Thank you for sharing all that. I am not sure they have check the INR level, but I will relay that to her mom. She is been removed from gymnastics for now. She has not had blood in her joints, but suffered from blood pools on feet and bloody noses prior to diagnosis.\n\nMy sister is worried they will need to perform a uterine ablation on my niece if her menstrual bleeding does not get under control. She skipped placebo pills and bled through her last period. They moved her to a different combo pill and added progesterone to see if that helps.\n\nAre there any resources that helped you on this journey? My niece's healthcare is adequate and she has a hematologist case worker that is helping them jump through hurdles. But my sister is relying on the MDs and google to supplement. It really came down to finding the right pill. Adding progesterone is what did it for me. I think my progesterone birth control is the only thing that worked well. It still took a bit before my periods regulated on the pill. \n\nIf her period is particularly painful, add an Iron supplement. It is worked wonders for me with the bleeding and pain when I *do* end up break-through bleeding. It keeps me from becoming instantly anemic due to blood loss. Your mileage for your niece may vary, but I highly recommend iron for painful/heavy flows to anybody. \n\nTry to put off a uterine ablation as long as possible because at her age it can heal. I would highly recommend taking her to a gynecologist. They would know the best pills to try that would limit bleeding. It is how I got on the Syeda. \n\nFactor 7 is not affected by vitamin K, aspirin, or any real blood thinning medicine (except coumadin medication itself). So, for pain she can take many of those medications that are over the counter. \n\nThe IRN level tells you how long it takes for her body to clot her blood. Her actual Factor 7 level tells how severe the condition is. My lowest was 18, so I have a moderate form of it. \n\nIt is a really rare disorder, so not even a lot of Hematologists know about it. If she is concerned about the knowledge of her current oncologist/hematologist, then I highly recommend getting another specialist. \n\nThe only resource that helped me on my journey was a medical printout of the disorder for doctors, and the Hemophilia official website. The rest has been trial and error. \n\nKeeping her joints strong is the easiest way to avoid joint bleeds, so maybe having her do a non contact sport like power-lifting or track. \n\nAlso: I get bloody noses and bruises very easily. She might want to put in a 504 for her daughter's school and list specific physical limitations and that bruising is extremely common symptom of the disorder. It might save your family a lot of misconception with teachers seeing bruising and thinking abuse. \n\nHope all this helps!! She is seeing a gynecologist now who recommended a combo pill and a progesterone one. It gives me hope that worked for someone else. They are going to see how this goes for the next few cycles if they can stop her periods for a short time.\n\nHer INR was 5 when she was first seen and Factor vii was so low/nonexistent that the lab had to rerun it as they thought there was an assay error.\n\nThe school nurse is working with my sister about understanding my niece's needs and medications. \n\nShe wants to try yoga for now. Weight lifting and track are good ideas.\n\nThanks for all the advice! Anytime! Glad I could be of assistance in anyway!", "I keep getting nose bleeds. Is it normal? Like the title says the past week or so I keep getting around 1-2 nosebleeds a day. I have never in my life experienced this, I did not hurt my nose in anyway. Has anyone has had this happen?", "Zoloft and Von Willbrand? Hi everyone, this is my first time in getting my own family doctor also I am in college. \n\nA residential doctor had prescribed me 50mg of zoloft for anxiety last Friday. She told me I would use this for at least a month to see the full effects. (She actually wants to ease my anxiety first and then I would get meds for Add/Adhd).\nShe had to get up and leave multiple times to get approval from her supervisor while consulting me. Since it is first my time, I vaguely remember my mom not wanting me to use Advil and my sickness/lethargy when I would be on my period.\n\nI suspect I may have von Willbrand as I dont seem to have the other symptoms of other blood disorders. (My family doesnt know the name unfortunately).  I tried telling her at the end, but she dismissed me and said she would administer a blood test next time if I make an appointment. \n\nI only took zoloft once and I was sonly dizzy but I am afraid. I also had trazodone prescribed to me in the past (different doctor) i took 25mg and had a irregular heartrate. Thankfully nothing happened but I think I was lucky....I was not sure why but after Googling it,now I know. I stopped taking it on my own.\nHow can I being in this concern with the new residential doctor? So you are not diagnosed and are just thinking you may be? \nYou should just be able to schedule a lab appointment and have them check for hemophilia disorders.\n\nI will say I do not think anything you have shared here sounds like hemophilia, the side effects of your medications and period are pretty common side effects for those things.\n\nBut you certainly have the right to get some labs done and it is nothing you should be afraid to ask for. You just make the appointment with the lab and they will send the results to your doctor. I have von willibrands and take zolft. I also have a lot of depression and anxiety, having von willibrands never change what meds could be given for those. Tightness in your chest and light headedness are common side effects of Zoloft during your first couple weeks. This medicine should not interfere with your suspected bleeding disorder. If this is a serious concern, you should contact a hematologist. Hi! I took Prozac for eight years for anxiety/depression, and was just diagnosed with Adult ADD last year. I switched over to Zoloft at that time, and started taking Dexedrine before switching over to Strattera due to bad side effects. I was diagnosed with VWD 18 months into me taking the Prozac on a regular basis. \n\nProzac worked well for me, until it did not. I only switched because my tolerance overgrew and it just was not working anymore, and was switched to SSRIs like Zoloft and Prozac affect your brain chemistry, and do not have much to do with your blood and clotting factors. \n\nThat said, dizziness is also a pretty common side effect for a lot of medications. Pretty much every medication I have taken for various conditions warn to be expect it on the pill bottle. A weird, irregular heart rate is, however, something to be concerned about. It could be because that particular pill mixes badly with caffeine (which has happened to me), or because it feels like your stomach is being eaten alive due to not having eaten food with your medications. \n\nJust be open with your doctor about wanting to go for a bleed time. Explain your symptoms and the oddities from your childhood as your reasoning, and they should be more than happy to set up a referral for you. \n\nAlso, just an FYI, I was prescribed to take an Iron supplement to go along with my Epilepsy. As soon as I started taking the supplement once a day along the rest of my meds, my debilitating periods stopped. Those first few days I actually became functional instead of having to sleep at home, in bed, waiting to seize from the pain and blood loss. Folic Acid with Iron is also good, since it helps produce and maintain new cells. ", "Hemophilia in the media: \"Sawbones: Hemophilia\" ", "CBD/MMJ/Alternatives for Pain Management? Hello all.   Forgive any stupid questions, I am just going out on a limb here.   The man I would do anything for is a hemophiliac and I would love to help him find some pain relief.  If it makes a difference to any reply, his biggest source of pain is his knee joint.   \n\nHe went to pain management for many years but stopped that a few years back (he learned his then wife was sneaking his pills and then, when he stopped PM, discovered she was an addict) and refuses to consider pain pills again.  \n\nHe used to smoke MJ but that is not an option currently.  And FTR, Medical MJ is not legal here in the buckle of the Bible Belt.   Does anyone have experience with CBD oils, salves, etc.  or any other alternatives for pain relief?  Hes hitting a really low point, is drinking a whole lot and I am seeking any other ways I might be able to help him.  \n\nThoughts? Suggestions? Do not use CBD oil myself, but my roommate swears by it! Not sure what else, but good luck and I hope you all get this sorted out! I am severe A and use cbd on my joints when they have problems. It helps pretty good. Has he started Hemlibra yet? I pretty sure it is changing my life thanks to knowing a little pain from working out is not likely to result in *more* pain and loss or range-of-motion tomorrow. Basically, it is inspired me to quit smoking and getting shit-wasted thanks to the fact that I may be able to get healthier without worry.\n\nOtherwise, I have also posted about CBD in this sub a while back. I talked with people about it. I ended up trying it. I have also smoked plenty of weed in the past.\n\nAs far as weed goes, it depends on the person. I get fucking paranoid. I start hallucinating. My heart starts racing because I cannot tell whether I am feeling *more* pain or *less* pain. With the strains I have tried over time, I did not feel better.\n\nAs far as CBD goes, I actually felt pretty okay in a lot of ways. Problem being, it is expensive as fuck. If you do not have a decent job, it would be a massive tax to take consistently. \n\nI found out it was FDA approved this year for epilepsy, though. Some type of CBD-based medicine, at least, although I doubt that would allow me to get a prescription for my hemophilia. I was actually going to ask about that soon from my hemophilia clinic. You might want to recommend he look into that too.\n\nOtherwise, I feel like Hemlibra coupled with CBD would prevent me from eventually getting addicted to opiates. I figured that was going to be my future for the longest time, and I am lucky with my joints for being 31, but even still the pain and depression has been destroying my mind enough that I wanted to give up and get on something like that.\n\nAfter starting Hemlibra, again, I feel like this might all be different. I am in Indiana, and I guess we started trials earlier than most places, so I have no idea if other clinics have access to it yet, but I would *highly* recommend he look into it.\n\nIt can be extremely dangerous if he has an inhibitor and takes FEIBA, but they would warn about all that stuff and figure out a plan. \n\nThis has just been my recent experience. I have been using alcohol to dull my mind from all my worries for quite a long time, so I know how it feels.  Hi there, sorry to hear about your partner\u2019s joint problems. I have severe  haemophilia b and sometimes have an ankle problem. \n\nHere are a few tips:\n\n- Get a scan to see what the problem is. He may require surgery,physio or a chiropractor.\n- Try and ascertain what physical things are triggering the pain(s) i.e. certain types of activities, poor footwear etc and adjust accordingly.

Other than my right main knuckle, I do not really have any lasting damage anymore, most of them got away over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started fitness when I was 18 and was able to hold on to it for 3 days as I ended up in the hospital.\n\nSeveral years later I started doing body weight exercises (pull ups) for a few weeks and never got any bleedings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is why 6 months ago I picked it up again. I started with pullups, dips, squats, pushups, rows, etc..  Right now I have increased the biggest exercises to  an added weight of 20kg on the pullups and dips to 40kg on the squats. (weight vest) and backpack filled with water bottles lol).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I can even Pistol squat, front lever for a few secs, muscle up, handstand, ...\n\nI gained more than 10kg of muscles and right now im at a weight of 95 kg with a height of 1.97m around 10-11% bodyfat.\n\nI have been dieting as wefll all this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is now, do you think my body might be strong enough to hit weights at the gym again? I mainly want to focus on big excercises like deadlifts and weighted squats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking forward for feedback!\n\nPeace /r/bodyweightfitness\n\n/r/Fitness I do squats and deadlifts on the recommendation and guidance of my physical therapist with no issues at all. I actually just had a shoulder bleed three weeks ago and I wondered if it was pull ups but I have been doing them for years with no issues so it could have been completely unrelated.\n\nIf you have got a physical therapist you trust, they can probably help you out. I tend to avoid any weightlifting that involves a lot of range of motion or quick movements, but controlled added weight squats and deadlifts have been great for me. Sounds like your joints are in pretty good shape.  Just keep your factor levels up and go slow, making sure your body (specifically your joints) can handle the added resistance.  Unfortunately I have damaged my ankles, knees, and elbows to the point that resistance training or even moderate use causes more damage and even more loss of motion.  If you can, talk with your physical therapist and build a workout regiment under their guidance.  If not, increase the resistance/weight slowly.  If you do get a bleed allow yourself time to heal completely before beginning your regiment with the injured joint again.  And remember the damage inflicted today will come back with a vengeance later.  It sounds like you are cautious and have the right mindset, just maintain that vigilance. I do not have any regrets, but I sure would like to go back 10, 20, 30 years with the knowledge I have now.  I would have taken much better care of myself. Being a \"tough guy\" because of youthful arrogance and my ego back then is costing me 10 fold today.  Common sense is your best ally.  Godspeed.  Do you take medication? Like factors? Sounds like you are pretty strong and that is great! I think asking a physiotherapist familiar with bleeding disorders these questions would get you the best answers. If you have access to a hematologist, or even a nurse coordinator with a bleeding disorders program, give them a call too. Go hit up your HTC and talk with the PT to get advice about what work out routines are best.  Additionally, go hit the NHF website.  Go to the Steps for Living section and hit the young adult step where they have some pretty good advice for sports and working out. Hello my fellow factor VII 3% friend! I also have the same diagnosis. I have exercised using weights as well as cardio every day for the past 3 years, and have even managed to do CrossFit fairly regularly. \n\nThe BIGGEST lesson I have learned working out continuously - do what you are comfortable with, and ignore everyone who is not a hemophiliac when they tell you what your limits are. Only YOU know what your limits are.  I stick to comfortable movements and absolutely emphasize form above all else. \n\nI do squats, deadlifts, pull-ups, dips, all the Olympic movements like snatch, cleans, push jerks, etc. However, I always master my form with the help of friends watching / critiquing me and I always stop immediately when something gets uncomfortable. Weights can absolutely be a healthy exercise for hemophiliac but I have to take pride out of the equation and learn how to harness my drive. I lift weights that feel comfortable, rarely max out (as it really tests the strain of all your muscles), and only add weight when I know I am ready for it. \n\nHeavy lifts I stay away from - squats, cleans (power cleans and squat cleans), snatches, bench, and pull ups. I have found that adding HEAVY weight to these things simply does not work comfortably with my body; it puts too much pressure on my shoulders and hips. I still do these exercises, but only at weight that I feel comfortable with. I also stay away from running / box jumps as it is high impact on all my leg joints. \n\nAll that being said, I have only had bleeds when I have pushed the limits of weight on the said workouts above. I have gained a lot of muscle and can confidently say that I am a fairly fit person. Happy trails my friend and if you have any questions I am always here!  Thank you all for your support!\n\nI am an official gym member now and I must say that I am not doing bad at all. \n\nDid a 110kg deadlift the other day with not too much hassle. \n\nHowever, if u train your legs. BE CAREFUL. I had a bleeding just from doing weighted calve raises + stretching too hard afterwards. Luckely I injected myself when I got home and it was gone 2-3 days later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPractice and repetition is key. Start LOW. In the start i did 5-6 pull ups max.. Now I can do 20 in a row with no effect what so ever on my joints or muscles in terms of bleeding. I can even do a few reps now with 20-30kg extra weight. \n\nIt is very important to listen to your body and dont let your ego fool you. ", "Q. Haemophilia &amp; travel Hi, I live in the UK and I am a 16 year old with severe haemophilia A. I receive my treatment via the NHS for free and Was wondering if I were to go travelling after I finish school how I would acquire my treatment abroad. If anyone has any knowledge or experience I would appreciate any info thank you. Take your medicine from UK itself if they allow it, it is an expensive drug and other countries may hesitate to provide it to foreigners, and there is no way you can afford it if you had to pay up for it. Thank you for your reply. I did forget to mention that I plan on being abroad for a year. I treat twice a week so I feel taking all treatment with me would be impossible. It depends on which country you will live in. If its a developed one besides US, you probably will have access to regular treatment.\n\nLesser developed countries are out of the picture. They most definitely will not provide you with medications. Thank you very much for your advice. I was thinking of New Zealand so I will have to do my research. Hopefully I am using hemlibra by then which will require less treatment. I once spent 6 months in Australia and my doctor arranged a delivery to Sydney (from Europe) and I could just go to that hospital and pick it up Maybe you can have someone ship it to you every month or something like that? Not sure if it is possible, just a suggestion The longest I have travelled for is nearly 3 weeks. I brought all my factor with me. Especially in El Salvador, where there is not really much care for those with bleeding disorders. If you plan on travelling abroad for a year, you should really talk with your care team to come up with an action plan for how you are going to get access to factor and supplies. You should also have a travel letter (translated if you need), a medical alert bracelet, and information where the closest treatment centre is for the country you are in. The World Federation of Hemophilia has a database of all HTCs available globally.\n\nIt is very doable these days to travel abroad as a bleeder! There was even a bleeder who climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and injected his meds there too. Pretty awesome! That is a cool story I will have to read in to that, thanks for the response. There are quite a few commonwealth countries who have reciprocal medical treatment plans with the U.K. \n\nAuz &amp; NZ should be ok, just need to get your haem centre in the U.K. to liaise with the centres on your travels for supplies. \n\nHave you asked the haemophilia society in the UK? They might have some answers. \n\nI have travelled a lot but never on prophy. But have had treatment for a couple of bleeds - always checked where the centres are first and planned my routes around it. WFH website has a list of them all. \n\nMake sure you have good travel insurance (this will be expensive...trust me) \n\nBasically yes you can do it. But it will require more planning than the average gap year :) \n\n(I have Severe VWD) On the mountaintop? Did he post photos? Very curious about the procedure to infuse at high altitudes and extreme temperatures. I think at the summit, but I have not been following too closely. He posts about it on his ( Thank you sorry I have only just seen this brilliant advice will be sure to ask my team and do the research Just curious. But how do you receive treatment? It is awful your country does not provide it :( just interested how you cope?! I dont go out much often because of risk of bleeding. Sacrifised fun for better joints. A small price to pay for salvation. \n\nWhere are you from? And how is the treatment in your country, if you dont mind me asking?", "Seemed like a good idea at the time.... Hey everyone. So I got discharged from the hospital about a week and a half ago. I was in for about a month with a pretty severe hematoma in the wall of my duodenum. On bowl rest getting tpn for about the entire time. When they discharged me they presented me with the idea of leaving my picc line in. If you do not know what a picc line is it is basically a special kind of IV goes into my upper arm, up and around and ends at the right atrium of my heart. I went with it thinking it will be awesome to take my factor lX not having to poke myself twice a week. Just screw the syringe on one of the ports and boom, that is it. Well it is more work then that.. I need to flush these bastards daily with saline and sodium sitrate. It is fine if you have a helper to screw them on but a pain in the ass if you have no one as you kind of need two hands to screw things on. Infection is a real concern, because it is connected to my heart you cannot mess around. I am gunna give it maybe another 2 weeks then I will get it removed. I have to drive 2 hours to fucking Edmonton just to get it taken out. Anyways if you are ever in the hospital and your hemotologist suggests keeping the picc in after discharge, Say no. Not worth it, not one bit. Oh and showering is a bitch.", "If you have not heard about 'Iron Max' you should check this out! This little dude has a great attitude :) ", "How would i know i have inhibiter? Like is there any symtoms? Main facet of an inhibitor is factor infusions being either completely or largely ineffectual. If you have treatment routine, prophylaxis or on-demand that seemed to manage bleeding before but now do nothing to prevent or stop bleeding, than it may be an inhibitor. If you are worried about it, hopefully you can talk to a hematologist and get an inhibitor test. At least in the States I know I get one every year even though that probably is not strictly necessary. Just to mention, it could just be the treatment plan that is not working. I switched products last year and it was an absolute game changer when it came to having spontaneous bleeds. I agree with Charles. My FVIII was not working but I did not have an inhibitor, my half-life was too short on the product I was using.\n\nIt is important to work with your provider to sort out what is going on for you. Ty everyone. How could you test it tho? should i arrange an appointment or somthing? Yes. Your hematologist should be checking for an inhibitor regularly anyway. But if you are concerned then a trip to the doctor is in order. It is hard to fully diagnose an inhibitor without the actual lab test since there is a lot of outside factors that could contribute to factor being less effective. One being weight gain. Your doc can check for inhibitors and can also do a recovery study (pk study) to test the half-life.", "Anyone had experience with root canals? I was referred to an Endodontist by my dentist.   Obviously experience with hemophiliacs will be limited...\n\nI am concerned that the xray might show up a little darker because of grinding and perhaps a bleed in there.

But since Florida did not expand medicaid when the ACA was implemented, it is likely that a plan that covers factor will EXTREMELY expensive.

I have found TONS of peer-reviewed research articles that all say COVID is directly related to Von Willebrand factor (&amp; other blood stuff) and adverse effects are usually blood related.\n\nThe reasons I do not want to get the vaccine are not only due to the low VWF \u2026 I have other health issues and I simply want to wait until more research is out there.  \n\nDoes anyone know people with Von Willebrand issues that received the COVID vaccine and had adverse effects?  Any thoughts?? I have vwd and got the J&amp;J shot. Had a low grade fever, chills, fatigue for less than 2 days. You are scared of COVID but do not want to get vaccinated? Billions of people have been vaccinated, including people with every medical condition out there. If you want to remain healthy, get vaccinated. There are no correlations with people with factor deficiencies getting the vaccine. The only thing I have heard is that you would be less likely to have complications from over clotting. But I do not really think that is science based. \nEveryone I know with hemophilia and vwd that have had the vaccine are fine. (Like 4 people with vwd and 10 with hemophilia A or B.) No- scared of the vaccine.  I have read that adverse affects are typically surrounding blood conditions.  Like I said I have OTHER health things that also make me not want to get it - so as to not add to the list of issues.  I was simply asking a question directed toward people who either have low VWF or know someone.  Your time is appreciated either way.  :) What are your concerns about the vaccine though? There are no blood-related adverse effects for the mRNA vaccines, and the thrombosis from AZ and J&amp;J is exceptionally rare.\n\nActual COVID has devastating side effects, especially for people with pre-existing conditions. How long ago did you get it??  Did you take J&amp;J because it is better for people with VWD?  Do you know if a certain vaccine is better or worse for people with VWD? Did those people have Low or High Von Willebrand Factor?  Do you know which vaccine those people took? I am not sure which ones. Moderna or phizer are the two we have here. They were all low on factor levels. That is how I know them because I work with them getting them factor. Have von willebrands, mixed Pfizer and moderna. Felt like crap the day after my second dose and bruised a bit worse than my normal friends. My reaction was slightly better than average out of my coworkers. The standing advice from Canada\u2019s hemophilia society is take whichever vax you can as soon as you can and that we are not at higher risk for adverse affects I am mostly concerned that it has not had years of testing like other vaccines.  I am also concerned that since I have blood issues that something will arise due to those issues \u2014- I have other \u201crare\u201d issues that are difficult to manage and do not want to add to the stress of dealing with another rare health problem.  With my luck-it would happen. THANK YOU.  This is why I seek opinions &amp; experiences from my fellow redditors :) Do you have low Von Willebrand factor? You work with them getting Von Willebrand Factor??  Please elaborate\u2026I was under the impression that my condition was not treatable. Not a doctor so I cannot respond to the question around best shot for vwd. I got the j&amp;j because I have had anaphylaxis in the past to medicine and did not want to risk that reaction with the Pfizer and Moderna. I got my shot in April, before the j&amp;j blood clot risk came known. At that point, they were tracking the number of people who had anaphylactic reactions to the other two so I thought the j&amp;j was better choice for me. Your health history puts you at a higher risk than others if you ended up contracting COVID, that is not a gamble I would recommend taking. \n\nThe vaccines were developed after years of research on this technology and after millions of dollars and tons of manpower were poured into vaccine development in 2020. We have a boat load of safety and efficacy data for them, and they have been approved by the FDA under EUA which simply sped up production alongside the approval process for a faster rollout. Got it, thank you for your responses! You sound very informed.  Are you in the medical field? I am a medical student, yes I have type 1 VW. I got Pfizer in dec/Jan while pregnant. No issues.\n\nThe covid/blood connections are that covid itself causes vasculitis and clotting. So it would stand to reason that VW disease is protective against this complication. The reported complication of sinus venous thrombosis in vaccinated people was at the same rate as the general population, so there is no increased risk of clotting in the vaccinated. Thank you for your input!  Very helpful. Wow.  See these are the types of experiences I need to hear about directly.  Thanks so much! People with vwd can use humate-P or alphanate. Besides the usual transexamic acid.  There used to be something called stimate, but they stopped making it after a recall of the delivery device, I am not sure if they will start again. But the people I know using Humate-P , it works well for them. It is a factor 8 infusion, but it also has vwd factor as well. You might want to review the Qs and As from the NHF here:  I have severe type three vWD, I got both shots, Moderna for both. I injected my factor before the first shot and did not bleed. Second shot I did not infuse right before, and I bleed a small amount. I got the usual side effects, fever, chills, headache, but I was fine after a week.\n\nCan you link the research papers? I would like to read them. Type 1, VWBs here. Double Moderna vaccine. Outside fatigue with the second shot, I really had no issues. Sorry I am new to Reddit.  Can I upload PDFs?\n\nEdit (new to posting &amp; commenting although I have lurked on Reddit for quite some time) I have severe type 3 von willebrands and got both pfizer with zero issues. All of the major Hemophilia Treatment Centers in the United States are all advocating for their patients to get the vaccine. There is also Wilate with is equal parts von willebrands factor and factor 8. There are lots of treatment options. \nPersonally I self infuse factor 3 times a week. What country do you live in  \n\nAll the research I have seen about issues with the vaccine are for people who are OVER clotters not UNDER clotters like all of us :-) Hi from Israel, i have hemophilia A and von vilibrant, i got 2 shots pfizer back in january and i\"m still good, not to bad side effects too. Severe Hemophilia A with an inhibitor. i got the pfizer shot. felt like crap for a couple of days but it is way better than getting covid again. i suggest if you are worried about the vaccine instead of asking random people on reddit to reach out to your local HTC or Hematologist. I did the hematologist that diagnosed VWD was non -committal. No doctor wants to go out on a limb when the vaccine has NOT been approved by the FDA apparently. Moderna and Pfizer were non- committal and all over their website are disclaimers on this vaccine. So I am still confused if one has HSP, VWD and Anaphylactic conditions before the vaccine. not all of us out here are non vaxxers or extreme conservatives or as the left says right wing nutcases. This is the problem just trying to get at the probability of side effects.", "Hemlibra trial Tomorrow.....

Do you feel any difference? Wish me luck! I am still on Recombinant but all of the people I have known who take HemLibra say its absolutely life changing. Maybe you will notice it less but we are slowly working our way towards treatment that you barely have to think about! I hope this works well for you :) Thanks for for your input. Yeah I got lazy because it used to be like I did not have it. Almost no symptoms aside from occasional nosebleed. But now that I work it is more obvious.

I had that (arthralgia) and when I went to half a dose weekly, rather than a larger dose every two weeks, it went away. They think it is because of an immune response to the larger dose, but my body does not make the response to a smaller weekly dose. If you have sore joints just switch to weekly dosing regimen.

So far it has been amazing, not having to infuse intravenously is such a huge improvement. I was very bad with prophy, supposed to be every 3 days but would usually average out to once a week with Eloctate. Now with the ease of infusion and once every two weeks it will be a breeze. Good luck with it! Well my second dose is on Tuesday. I am looking forward to it for some reason.... \ud83d\ude02 Weird right? I do not think I have ever looked forward to infusions until Hemlibra.

Aslo if you do contract covid and and need invasive medical intervention, like being put on a ventilator., Hemophilia might add some additional complications with the risk of bleeding. \n\nI think for most of us the biggest anxiety is insuring we have enough factor to treat regularly.  Not that I think we should live in fear but I think it is prudent for all of us not to take too many risk right now.  You really want to avoid going to the hospitals right now.  I know my clinic has stopped routine appointments and are only dealing with urgent issues. I think the concern with Hemophilia is the fact that many individual in this community have been through HIV and Hepatitis and may be immunocompromised. I have not heard anything else that may indicate we may be at risk. If you are carrying the virus but not showing symptoms, there is a chance you could pass it along to someone with a lesser functioning immune system. Pneumonia could imply bleeding. I am not sure. Some literature says so.", "Von Willebrands Tooth Extraction Help! *I have mild Von willebrands type 1*\n\nI have my final wisdom tooth extraction coming up, and they typically pump me with DDAVP an hour before extraction. \n\nThe last two times I did this... I developed hyponatremia from the DDAVP, as I drank way too much fluids to help the other half of this for me...anxiety. \n\n...A common side effect of DDAVP is fluid retention, that can cause hyponatremia.\n\nSo, while I have done this 3 other times, it is not fun. I do not like the body sensations I feel after getting the DDAVP, and also I like to be able to have access to not fluid restricting, simply for my peace of mind.\n\n**My question is this: Is there any other alternatives with less side effects others here with mild von willebrands have used for a tooth extraction, or is DDAVP simply the best option?**  \n\n\n**I have looked into \"clotting factors\" like plasma derived etc.. could that be an option I can request with less side effects?**  \n\n\nThanks for any help in advance! Ultimately, tooths got to go, and i will do whatever it takes. Just trying to find a potential less side effect, better alternative to ddavp. I had my wisdom teeth removal almost a year ago. I was prescribed tranexamic acid and took it an hour before the procedure to reduce bleeding. Idk if it will be better than DDAVP. you should speak to your hematologist about other alternatives that best suit your needs. I would talk to your hematologist about TXA.  I have recently had really good luck using it in place of DDAVP for surgery, and my bleeds are severe.  But I did need to go to an actual hematologist who specializes in bleeding disorders to get it. I literally just had this chat with my hematologist this week. Confirmed a diagnosis of mild type 1 von willebrands and prescribed tranexamic acid, but told me to call him if I schedule any surgeries so he can tell me how much to take. Thanks a lot for this! I have heard about mouthwash transexamic acid, are they doing the mouthwash, or the actual pill? Thank you for this! It appears that DDAVP has much less side effect than TXA, however, they have a topical Mouthwash rinse tranexemic acid, that stays local in the area and i am going to inquire to my hematologist about this, thanks a lot! I will be taking the pills, but only during my menstrual cycle. My doctor just told me to let him know about any upcoming surgeries so he could figure out the dosage or if I would need DDAVP instead (for a more involved surgery). \n\nAlso mild type 1 and I will say- when I had my wisdom teeth out (two separate surgeries about 15 years apart) I did not require anything special to control my bleeding apart from some extra gauze. My first surgery was before I was diagnosed, second surgery was after diagnosis but at the time my blood tests were \u201cinconclusive\u201d. I did take extra care to make sure I did not develop dry sockets but did not do anything else differently than the routine after-surgery care the oral surgeon recommended. Of course you may have a totally different experience, but I wish you the best of luck! Interesting!  I feel super shitty every time I get DDAVP so I have been so happy to take TXA instead \ud83d\ude02 guess it is all individual So it is not just me! What efffexfs do you get on ddavp? I get super shakey, weak, and flushed, and get a bad headache.

Sadly it will prob take several years to get through the FDA. But it seems very promising The same company, ( is already working on it:\n\n&gt; Intellia will present additional data highlighting the potential of its liver insertion platform, as exemplified by the company\u2019s hemophilia B program. Intellia and Regeneron, the lead party, are co-developing potential hemophilia A and B CRISPR/Cas9-based treatments using their jointly developed targeted transgene insertion capabilities.\n\n\n&gt; Data shows the company achieved circulating activity levels for Factor IX (FIX), a blood-clotting protein that is missing or defective in hemophilia B patients, ranging from normal levels (50-150%, Source: National Hemophilia Foundation) to supratherapeutic levels in a six-week non-human primate study. Insertion efficiency and transgene expression can be controlled by three independent factors: the precise insertion site targeted by the guide RNA; the dose of LNP, which delivers the CRISPR machinery; and the amount of the promoter-less DNA template donor that encodes the transgene\u2019s DNA sequence for insertion. These levers allow for optimization of transgene expression according to the desired therapeutic target levels and may allow for higher levels of expression than those attained by traditional adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy, if required.\n\n\n&gt; Furthermore, unlike traditional gene therapy, for which a significant loss (over 80%) in transgene expression was observed after in vivo PHx and liver regeneration, Intellia\u2019s targeted gene insertion approach yielded durable edits as cells proliferate, with no significant loss in expression. These findings support the development of gene insertion therapies.

I havent had a bleed since I started.  It does make me sick for about a day after I take it, though. Same for me, I was always self conscious about my track marks, I have been questioned multiple times by nurses and doctors if I do herion. That is just one of the many ways it helped me I am a mom of two severe hemophilia A boys. They have been on Hemlibra for almost three years and it has completely changed our lives. Almost no work compared to using the port and sterile technique, once or twice a month vs twice a week and more for breakthrough bleeds. They got bleeds all the time using recombinant factor. In the almost three years they have been on Hemlibra they have had two and one bleed, respectively. For the most part they are normal boys and run and fall and do stupid boy stuff, and they are so well covered by Hemlibra. It is so rare that you find something that is so much less work and yet so much more effective! I have never got nausea after a infusion, did your talk to your hematologist about that, also so glad you have not gotten a bleed! Same happened to me when taking corona vaccine, the nurse asked doctor to take look at my shoulder due the marks, but the Doctor knew me so no worries I believe this medicine is one of the closest things to a cure for the Hemophilac community, it is is so wonderful seeing how much good it does. I am glad your boys are able to be boys, for me growing up I had to be cautious because it was 3 times a week back when I was younger, and it only got up to 15% compared to the 40% we get now Yeah, it is all within normal parameters.  I just have the immune system of a dumpster fire and it makes me a little ill.  At the end of the day, though, no bleeds is worth it. Yep. They would be at 1% after 36 hours. And my oldest is an incredibly severe severe hemophiliac. He is always had to have 50% more than the normal dose, and still bleeds even with me trying to help him be careful. It is awful seeing your child not able to participate in things because they might get a bleed. I know it is so hard for the child too. \n\nI sometimes forget that my younger son even has hemophilia. How is that even possible lol. You are right. It is almost as good as a cure. Still suffering with intravenous infusions \ni wish brazil had hemlibra :/ wow, same here. two and a half years, and zero bleeds. Yeah, any one here experience feel extra hungry after taking himlibra? I tried to hop on hemlibra but my HTC said my insurance would not approve it since I am mild \ud83d\ude2b You can try to negotiate a bigger gap between doses so that the cost is lower. It is worth trying. Are those 2 and 2 bleeds spontaneous or due to trauma? Did they resolve after only 1 dose of Factor VIII? As far as I could tell they have been spontaneous. Nothing obvious happened that I could point to and say that was what did it. For the more severe severe one it took two full doses. For the normal severe one, one dose took care of it. I suspect that giving him the dose before bed and then him not putting weight on it for twelve hours really helped too. In Denmark, we are still on Jivi or Kovaltry\u2026 really strange. My doctor says they have Hemlibra on the shelf. But its only for inhibitors patients\u2026 very very strange\u2026 Are you on prophy doses of regular factor? If so, they may be able to negotiate for price savings. I am also a mild and on prophy. I do not want Hemlibra yet as I want to see more research on women, but I think I would have an argument for cost savings at less infusions per month. I am not. I have had very few major bleeds in my life and really neglected to infuse for other \u201cminor\u201d ones which has not been the best idea.. I have considered going on prophy to try to mitigate damage from minor injuries sustained during exercise or general activity but have not really brought myself to do it which is why I would love to just hop on the hemlibra. As a mild insurance probably would not approve it without your being on regular prophy first\u2026 due to cost.\n\nThere is a FB group called mild matters you may want to connect with.

From being admitted into the hospital for bleed treatment or to be at home in bed resting or having pain 24/7 to a bleed that only happens from me either tripping or stubbing my toe or even just from walking for an extended period of time would be for me.

In highschool, every gym hour I had...it was replace with a session of pool and darts at the local pub...never gave a f..k!! Run\u2026 lots of running. I would definately do that.

My wife (pediatric pharmacist) tells me there is no good alternative around, but her hospital still has intravenous Stimate (called Desmopressin in IV form) that they have used on a few patients prior to things like dental surgery.  \n\nCheck with your healthcare providers if you feel you need it badly enough. I am not sure exactly what you have to do to convince your docs you need it, but at least its an option. I was just at a VwD Symposium and this was discussed heavily. There are not any decent alternatives, there are some self infusion medications typically used for more se ere VwD that would also work for mild but that obviously not ideal. Otherwise your really just stuck with going to the hospital for IV desmopressin u till it comes back. At the Symposium the CSL bering rep did say late 2022 for it to come back though so fingers crossed. This happened to me too, only a year ago. I spoke with my hematologist about it and and am now using an IV form of factor replacement and learning to infuse at home. I can give you more details if you want but I was interested to know more about how the stimate works versus how the factor replacement works and what happens in your body when you use it. Let me know if you want more details. I do know in the situations where I need stimate my hematologist told me to go to the ER immediately if the stimate did not work. Apparently I had grown to accept the early stages of hypovolemic shock as normal pre-diagnosis and I should have been going to the hospital the whole time.\n\nFortunately Stimate was working really well for me and I have not needed to do this. I am kind of worried about trying to stick a vein successfully at all considering how half the time the professionals have trouble getting my veins to pop. Then there is the rarity of the situation where I need it where I would not be doing it often enough to maintain the skill. Does anyone have experience with this? Do you just walk into an ER and ask for DDAVP? After my daughter was born I had some really heavy bleeding and no stimate and that is exactly what I did. I went to the Er said I have VwD and need stimate for heavy bleeding. It was a bit of a battle but they eventually gave it to me. That is fair. Not sure where you live, but my experience is that big cities in the US have drop in infusion centers. I have been to a few so basically a pharmacy issues the medication to you and sends a standing order to an infusion center. When you need a dose to be administered, you call them and tell them you are on the way, bring your meds, and they find the vein and do the rest. I live in a rural area so it is not quite that simple for me which is why I am learning to do it myself. To the person who said stimate via IV. It is called DDAVP in short, my son has used it before and it worked well for him! If the drip is too fast it can burn a little going in. I am type 3 VWB and I use humate-p. I do believe this works for all types of VWB as well. All administered in the ER as we do not self infuse yet. Yeah, factor replacement is a option for treatment too if ddavp not available - it does not work for 2A so have only ever had it to prove that it does not work!

I have both ears pierced and gauged a little, and I also have an industrial piercing, which I actually got earlier. I did not notice much bleeding for the tattoo, but it was *super* diligent in treating for like the next two weeks. The industrial was, well it was kind of a shit show. I bled at the time, and for a few days after. Not like the other commenter saying blood shot out of his nipple (Really dude? You did not treat for a few days? I would almost say you deserve it, but I have been there) My regular ear piercings were pretty chill. My gf has a bunch of piercings so I was sorta able to compare the healing and recovery period. It seems like a bleed a little longer, had soreness for longer, and I had to wait longer before going up a size with the gauge. Nothing insurmountable though. I would say if you want any body mods go for it, do not let hemophilia be the thing that stops you. Reply and I will answer any questions you have.  The tattoo should not be a problem - there seem to be a number of hemophiliacs with tattoos out there. That said you absolutely want to check with your hematologist and make sure that the tattoo artist is aware of your condition, because they will definitely want you to sign some sort of waiver if they even agree to ink you in the first place. Oh, I never thought about the waiver thing. Thank you! That gives me hope! I will make sure to be super safe You have basically answered all the questions I could have had, thank you! That gives me a bit of hope haha.\n\nOh, I think I have one... What else did you do to treat your bleeds aside from the standard factor injections? Would ice packs and such be okay for an ear piercing or a tattoo? Yeah of course. If you can figure out how to ice your ear lobe go for it! You probably do not need to ice a tattoo, it might negatively affect the tattoo color and design, but I am not sure. The tattoo honestly was not so bad. I did not really need to ice it or anything. Just the regular after care worked fine for me.  Yep, just got to make sure you infuse, certain body locations are better than others as well. I have had piercings, and a tattoo with no issues. This was about 15 years ago as well, and medicine is a lot better now. I am on Eloctate now which is wonderful, it has a much longer half-life.\n\nI mean other than extreme stuff, there is not much you cannot do these days. Wish these medicines existed 35 yrs ago and then maybe I would not have so many replacement joints lol.\n Thank you so much! I will keep that in mind. And thank you for the Eloctate tip, I did not know different kinds of factors existed. Now that I do I can do more research.\n\nAlso, what do you mean by overdoing waxing? Alright, thank you! What I am planning to get is super small anyway. It is just to commemorate a life event, kind of like a personal reminder. I hope the small size means it will heal easy. No problem, there is many different factor replacements. Your hematologist, pharmacy company, or even your nearest hemophilia foundation can give you a lot more info.\n\nEloctate for example, has a longer half so I can remain at higher levels for longer. My dose is only 3 CCs every 4 days, I often even go 6 days bc I simply feel so good sometimes I forget to dose.\n\nOverwaxing is where you well over wax. If you are new to it, doing too much in focused area can do too much damage the area and cause a bleed.  \n\nLike chest waxing for example, the first few times can really cause damage, so it is best to do it over the course of a couple days til your skin kind of toughen up.\n\nIf you are female stuff like legs are likely ok to do all at once the first time, just infuse, and watch how your skin reacts. Going up the thigh and groin area, the skin can get a lot more sensitive, so do light experiments to see how u do. Alright, thank you so much! Yeah I prob did deserve it. Honestly I think I would treated it for a few days after but missed a treatment about a week later. It just took longer than I expected to heal. \n\nIt was also almost 20 years ago. The factor was not where it is now, plus being 18 and stupid factored into most of my decisions of the time.  I know more Severe Hemophiliacs with tattoos then I know non-hemos with tattoos... That... Is oddly inspiring. I have several large tattoos and am a hemophiliac. My hematologist would not give his blessing but gave me instructions to infuse before a session and the following night after. I luckily had no problems.  I will do the same! Maybe more. Thank you! Sure thing. Just make sure you talk to your hematologist and your tattoo artist. Certain areas like your neck and chest are not worth the gamble.  I am thinking of the upper spine / nape area, but I will talk to my doctors and the artist first! Not this design but this area\n\n Cannot really give any advice on that area as I am not a doctor/tattoo artist. Definitely ask your hem. before looking for an artist  Good point. That might be the most logical course. Thank you! Discussing it with your hematologist is always a good idea, but I would not necessarily mention it to the tattoo artist. I guess just use your best judgement. But when I got my first tattoo I had to sign a waiver and there were and several medical conditions listed saying that if you had any of these you could not get tattooed. Haemophilia was among these. I am severe type A. I have 4 tattoos and did not have a problem with bleeding for any of them. Just dose up beforehand and you should be fine. I would imagine the same goes for hair removal, so I have never had any done so cannot really say. Like others have mentioned here piercings can be a very different story depending on the location and the artist. But I would imagine that earlobes who would be on the lower end of the risk scale. Thank you so much! No problem. Good luck!  I am late but I have Severe A and have tattoos, my ex waxed my leg hair when I was drunk once, and I had my ears pierced for a couple years. Prophy has allowed me to live a semi normal life. I even wrestled and played soccer growing up.  Severe A with a few large tattoos. My worst one was on my left breast. Took about 7 and a half hrs in 1 session. Factored up in the shop, the day after, and day after that. Had limited range of motion in my neck and shoulder for about 2 weeks (probably just because of the bruise). Tattoos are basically bruises and should be treated as such. I just got another one on my upper arm and a bit on the back last weekend, it was random and I was due for factor, bled out a bit and had an elbow bleed for a few days but I just treated the bleed and everything was fine", "Any Hemo brother from Dubai?  Hello everyone.\n\nI have hemophilia-a (severe) and I use Hemofil-m which I usually purchase from the Hemophilia federation here in India.\n\nI am planning to visit Dubai for work purposes and might need to stay there for more than 2 months. I wanted to know if Hemofil-m is available in Dubai and whom shall I contact for the same. How much does this Hemofil-m cost you? Haemophilia Federation of India provides factor viii (despite of the brand and price) at a subsidized rate. Usually INR 11 per unit + 5% tax on total purchase amount. Hemofil-m is not generally available, mainly because of the covid situation but it is the only factor viii that suits me. I have suffered severe allergic reactions to other brands. In addition, ever since Takeda owned Hemofil-m, it is not available through representatives or agencies as it used to be when baxter/baxalta used to sell it. The price printed on the box was updated last year and I have not purchased it from HFI as well in a while (due to non availability) so I cannot tell the print price as of now.", "Dentistry and hemophilia My father in law has a mild form of hemophilia a. He went to a dentist and they want to do a root canal on one of his broken teeth. The dentist consulted his clinic and the clinic is saying that the risk of giving him a shot of novacane is to risky because they might hit a vein. They would rather pull the tooth. Does this sound normal?  I ask because he has a clinic appointment next week and we want to have a further talk with them on this. It does not make sense in the face of it. \n\nHave anyone experienced anything like this? I have severe hemophilia A and have had tons of dental work. They do not even use Novocain anymore I thought. But even so, I had it plenty and never had issues. If he takes factor and is concerned just infuse before hand. If he does not he really should not be concerned in the least. Pulling a tooth is more invasive than a root canal too. Everything about this sounds wrong. I would find a new dentist. Or is it possible your dad wants his tooth pulled so he is not being straight with you? Because this sounds off. I am fairly certain that is absolutely absurd and you need to get a second opinion. I am severe B and while I have had wisdom teeth taken out, its not a simple process. Getting a shot of novocaine is about as irrelevant to a bleeding disorder as it gets. Please talk to his hemotologist yourself or have someone else you trust do it. Severe A and have had most every dental procedure you can get including a root canal.  I cannot count the number of injections the dentist has given me, but I puncture my veins with a needle 3 times a week for Factor and it is never been a problem.  I do not think the dentist talked to an experienced hematologist.  I think the person that took the call was being overly cautious because they did not have any idea.  Like the nurses that think I am a Wildman because I ask for a shaving kit 3 days into a hospital stay.  They assume a razor blade is certain death to a hemophiliac. My clinic advises the same thing, even my Dentist likes to avoid it. They still do the shots, just usually do a lot more around everywhere they can except the danger zone. That is odd.  Would not the risk of bleeding be higher with removing a tooth versus an injection?\n\nIf they were that worried the clinic could infuse him in the morning to get his FVIII level up before his root canal. Yea Oh yeah. When I had my last tooth pulled it bled for a week with treatment every day. I have had one root canal (many years ago) and I just dosed up prior to the procedure.  It was uneventful.\n\nAre they actually suggesting pulling a tooth without novocaine?  Does not compute. Just want to add my support for the other comments here. I have severe hemophilia A and I have had plenty of dental work done, including wisdom teeth removal as well as other procedures that used local anasthetics.\n\nHeck, I have had major invasive spine surgery, there is not a lot that cannot be done these days, even with hemophilia. How was the process of having your wisdom teeth taken out?  I never did due to bleeding concerns but my dentist gives me a lot of crap about it. It was honestly not bad at all as far as bleeding goes. It was a lot of prep with factor leading up to, beforehand, and after but I really do not remember bleeding much at all which was very surprising to me because I have gotten cuts in my mouth before that refused to go away for days. The worst part was the nagging pain which I am sure is just something everyone has to deal with, hemophiliac or not. It did not quite raise to the point of a bad joint bleed but man it is just really naggy, constant pain. I think I was just lucky to have a dentist okay with doing it and an HTC that communicated well. It seems to be the biggest hurdle from the things I have read on here.", "What painkillers can i use if i have severe hemophilia ?  For OTC it is acetaminophen aka paracetamol. For prescription, I am typically given hydrocodone or oxycodone for severe pain, acetaminophen with codeine for moderate.  If you live in an area where it is legal to use cannabis for medical purposes, please talk to your doc about starting this instead of or in conjunction with other pain medicines. Shit I just use like Tylenol if I need to.  Will smoking cause bleeds ? Probably not but it will cause other health issues. Oils, edibles etc are all good alternatives? I could be wrong, but are not there places that will not hire you even if you do medical cannabis? I know my cousin cannot and he is a truck driver. They get drug tested and even if he does it for medical use, he can be fired. If you have chronic pain, see if your hematologist can refer you to a recently trained palliative care MD.  These people used to do end of life care bu over the past 7-10 years have branched out in to other groups of patients.  We use our pediatric team for our sickle cell kids who get chronic bone infarctions and have chronic nerve damage with pain.  They use low dose gabapentin.  Seems to work well.  Most of my hemophiliacs are on prophy since babyhood and have pretty stable joints.  I plan on using that team for them if they start having pain.   Tylenol the goat. Just do not use advil How often are you in pain? I pop a paracetamol with codeine if I have any achy joints after a long day etc. I drink but that is not healthy.  CBD salve helps my joints alot.  Depends on the state and the company. Some places (like truck drivers probably) have insurance that requires them to test employees. Most places these days do not require testing though.  A lot of jobs are federally regulated as well even if your implored in a legal state. I believe most truck driving positions are federally regulated. Same goes for the medical field You can also try Kratom if it is legal in your state.   What doese i do how it helps with pain ? You should Google it to learn more.  Basically it hits a lot of the same receptors as opiates, but is not deadly like opiates and not as addictive.  You can get addicted to it though, so you so have to be careful.  Withdrawals are nowhere near as bad as opiates though (unless you end up taking way too much for long periods). My ankle joints give me a fair bit of grief. I usually take co-codomol. More specifically for the joint pain caused by inflammation, I am prescribed celecoxib. It is an anti-inflam used fairly commonly in haemophiliacs with considerable joint issues. May be worth asking your doc about it if you have those issues. Lastly, if you are recovering from a bleed, keep factored up. Sometimes it is those little breakthrough micro bleeds that can cause pain. You can keep those at bay if you stick to a recovery prophy regimen and rest up. Do not go too hard, to early. Give you body time to recover and you will hopefully suffer from less long term pain down the line I was on dilaudid (hydromorphone) 4mg  a couple times a day.. stopped takin them and started cannabis", "Looking for Hemophiliacs in the US that use Factor 8 Recombinate.

So I have vwd type one (severe) and low favor 8. I also have a bad back and hips so I really would like to be seen by a chiropractor. \n\nI have always been told it is a bad move but I have talked with other hemos that go and they love it. Does anyone else go? Is your HTC okay with that? Do you think you benefit from the care? \n\nTIA! my family and i have vwd (i have type 3) and we go to the chiropractor. I love the chiropractor. the treatment helped me with my scoliosis, so never personally had issues with it! just let them know your health history and tell her doctor/hematologist you are going to a chiropractor. Look for one with good reviews/reputation as well. I think it heavily depends on what treatment they are doing. I have Hemophilia A Severe and went a few years back for some upper back pain, and he used the Graston Technique, which seemed innocent enough at the time -- just lightly messaging my back with a metal wand. A few days later my entire back was bruised and purple like I could not imagine. I would not get cracked, but they can prescribe massage and other cool structural integration / roofing stretching type of stuff that can be super helpful. It just totally depends on the person treating you. Do not be afraid to tell them to stop. Deep massage always messes me up so I always have to tell them to go really light. But light massage helps me a lot. I have never been able to safely get a massage without major bruising. Do you infuse factor right before you go in?  Yea. And I tell them I have hemophilia and to go really light. I have to repeat myself like every 3 mins depending on the therapist, but once the person gets used to it things go ok. There are a lot of kids of massage too. Structural massage was one of the most helpful things I have ever done. Not what you asked but I would never go to a chiropractor. It is a BS con, based on totally made up premesis. You are better off going to a massage therapist or a physical therapist than a chiropractor. Just look up the origins of chiropractic \u201cmedicine\u201d and you will see what I mean. Absolutely!!!! I have hemophilia and I see the chiro all the time. I have never felt better! Chiropractic is amazing Why does not the physical therapist from you are HTC treat you? Yep! My mom has gone for decades, and has taken my sister and I since we were young.  We all have vWD (I have type I, so do my mom and sister probably). There is no piercing/blood borne pathogen contamination happening when you see a chiropractor, sometimes he may have a clicker-like tool to help focus in on problem areas but other wise it is sort of like an intense massage or having somebody do the equivalent of cracking your knuckles, but in your spine/hips. Did you treat before you went in? I dosed before I went for a massage and I told her to break me in half. Did not bruise up. Type a severe too Because I usually go to the Detroit Medical Center when I have insurance but 1: it is a garbage hospital and 2: I do not have insurance. The chiropractor is significantly cheaper. The bone popping itself is fine, and some places also prescribe you some physical therapy.\n\nHowever, watch out for the ones trying to push other treatments like infrasound or the metal scraping tool.\n\nInfrasound will cause heat and microbleeds, which will mess your back up. The metal scraping tool I have only had good results from at an actual physical therapy clinic. Yeah, the pone popping is probably fine, but the upselling of different treatments can be dangerous. Only had good results with the metal wand at a full physical therapy place, and only after a few weeks of the therapist learning what I needed worked on.\n\nThe infrasound wands are also dangerous, causing heat and bleeds. I have severe A and go to the chiropractor all the time. I have always just discussed what I have and they are careful around my target joints. Never had a problem Sometimes I time my prophy to be near my Chiropractic appt if I am worried it may cause or exacerbate a bleed... sometimes the alignment helps stop a bleed!", "I do not know why I did not think to look for this SR. But I am very happy to have found it. I am 43/m with moderate B. Where are my factor IX brothers at? ", "Pregnant as Hemophilia A carrier - any advice? My father has hemophilia A.  I have not run a blood test, but genetics says that I would be a carrier (as would all of his daughters).  I do not really want to run a test given how expensive it is.  But anything I should be wary of during and after pregnancy? I realize my son would have a 50% chance of having hemophilia (assuming my husband does not carry the gene) and that my daughter would have a 50% chance of being a carrier. I am in the same boat. My dad had hemophilia, I am a carrier...BUT I ALSO HAVE MILD HEMOPHILIA myself. As many as 50% of carriers could have low factor levels themselves, giving them the diagnosis of mild hemophilia. Not only do you need your factor tested for your own safety, you need to get to an HTC.... Hemophilia Treatment Center... ASAP to keep yourself safe during delivery and have a solid plan in case you start hemorrhaging during or after delivery.\n\nHere is a column about women and hemophilia.... Scroll down to the earlier articles to learn more about how women get it.\n\n  Congratulations! Treatment is miles beyond where it is ever been and getting even better fast. So that is a relief. But it might be a good idea to have your factor level tested so you are more prepared Incase of heavy bleeding during birth. It is an easy thing to treat for either way so nothing to be worried about at all. Then again, in the past carriers were not even tested and they did not have too many problems as far as I know, so I do not think it is something to worry about if you cannot figure it out in time. If it were me I would have some Stimate and factor handy just Incase, but I know a lot of people and have easy access to that stuff. You might not. My daughters are carriers and one has a 40% factor VIII level and she bleeds once in a while from injuries so we have infused her a few times and uses Stimate for periods. My other daughter has not had her levels tested because she does not seem to have the same tendencies to bleed more. But I do want to get her tested soon, and we will if she is ever expecting. I know a few women carriers who almost bled to death with delivery so factor level testing is a must. My sister and I are opposites with her levels in the 80's and mine at 20. Always best to test and plan. Glad your daughters are doing well! Good to know. Thanks, we will definitely test. I keep meaning to get my youngest tested. They are still teenagers so ... You should get tested.  Factor levels are a key to your bleeding risk.  You should find the hemophilia treatment center nearest you (in the US, the CDC has a directory).  Plug in with a high risk OB doc so that you have a plan for hemorrhage control.\n\nMost carrier moms are not affected and do fine, but you should have a plan. Hi, I am a symptomatic carrier. I knew when I was pregnant that I had a 50% chance of having a boy with severe hemophilia A. He was born with hemophilia and is now almost three years old. Be very grateful that you know ahead of time that you are a carrier. You are able to prevent the challenges that come up when the diagnosis is a surprise. Contact a hemophilia treatment center right away. If you do not want to do genetic testing they will still want to check your factor levels. They will likely be incredibly high, because you are pregnant. They will want to check them again a few weeks after birth. When you go to the HTC you will probably meet with a hematologist and a geneticist. Make sure you are dealing with pediatric doctors because the concern is for your son's potential hemophilia and not really you as a carrier. However, there are a few concerns for you at birth. My local (rural) hospital would not deliver my son because they did not have the resources to check factor levels via cord blood after delivery. This would take days or weeks to send the blood to another location for testing. He was born at the hospital that houses the adult and pediatric hematologists in our state, which was over an hour drive away (something to consider if you are planning a natural delivery). I had a scheduled c section but went into labor naturally three weeks early. Barely made it to the hospital in time for a c section (he was breach so natural delivery was not an option). Be flexible with your delivery plans. So anyway, they were able to confirm diagnosis within an hour of birth. It was terrifying to have teams of doctors come in to tell you all about hemophilia when all you want to do is cuddle your newborn. But remember that knowing you are a carrier is very beneficial at this point. Because of his quick diagnosis and medical support throughout pregnancy, there were no complications or bleeding problems, and he went home with us. At nine months old he had surgery to get a port a cath placed. I infuse him at home with factor viii twice weekly. The variety of hemophilia you are dealing with will determine your son's treatment. I wish you the best and hope he does not have hemophilia. But if he does, he will have a long and productive life just like everyone else. Just with a few more bruises and modern medical intervention. Relevant post today on ( My wife is a carrier of severe A and we of course knew a head of time, and she is also a nurse. \n\nWe have 2 boys (both doing well) now who do indeed have severe A (2 year old with a port and a new born), and 2 girls (no idea yet on carrier status).\n\nDo you live in the US? You should talk with a nearby Hemocenter and begin consulting with a hematologist asap. \n\nShould go without saying but obviously find out the sex ahead of time because there will have to be a whole precautionary birth plan if you find out it is a boy no matter what.

I took a large dose of factor, and it went away. I didnt notify my hemotologist because I just assumed it was a \"normal\" possibility with us. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks later... I notice it again. Blood in stool. I take another large dose, but it is still there. It is been getting worse. I am noticing more blood each day. But theres no pain, itching, or anything. No idea what it could be. I have an appointment tomorrow. \n\nGuys. Dont be stupid like me. If you notice anything unusual, call your hemotologist right away. I will keep ya posted. Is it fresh, red blood? Or darker and more rust colour? It happens to me sometimes and I had to get a scope to make sure it was not anything serious. Make sure you are drinking enough water, and eat lots of fibre. I started using metamucil and I do not bleed as often. I started a vegetarian diet on January 1st. Could be it. Honestly I recommend  psyllium fibre and factor up! Make sure you are okay to take it too. Good to know! Thank you so much for the help. Best to get it checked out..but could easily be something like Hemarrhoids. Good luck Hope you feel better soon :) That was my first thought! Hoping it is just that. But I have 0 pain or discomfort. Are hemorrhoids sometimes painless? Could be. Bright red usually means the bleeding is lower down the digestive system (ie the rectum) Notify your doctor, immediately. I had a lower GI bleed years and years ago. It took a colonscopy to discover I had a major ulcer. At first it was just a little blood so I shrugged it off. Over the course of a couple weeks, it amounted to a massive amount causing more issues than if I had told my doctor about it sooner. Hey brother! Thank you for your concern. I am sorry for what happened to you and I hope you are doing better now. My doc said it is just hemorrhoids for me which is a relief!", "The older I get, the more pain I am in... the less help doctors seem to be. I am 39... good lord, I am 39.

I have pain 100% of the time in both ankles, and my left elbow flares up quite frequently as well. I actually count myself as lucky that I do not have a ton of target areas, just the 3 &lt;knock on wood&gt;, but those 3 get worse by the year.\n\n4 or 5 years ago, my HTC dropped Oxycodone on me for times when I end up with bad bleeds. I quickly found out that it did not really help for bad bleeds, but boy did it help for the day to day. And I think that created a spark in me that said, hey maybe my days do not actually have to be filled with so much suffering. My HTC will not put me on anything that would work day to day though, and honestly I do not disagree with the logic entirely... you grow a resistance and as much as it sucks now it is going to get worse and I will need it more later. It makes sense.\n\nSo for the last 4 or 5 years I have been on the never ending quest to get rid of the day to day pain. Tylonel I stopped doing decades ago because it just was throwing money out the window, it does not help. I have ever increased my usage of Celecoxib but it only barely does more than Tylonel (Can you take more than 2 a day? Does it help?). The last couple of years I have slowly been increasing my reliance on ibuprofin. It used to be a couple a week, now it is a couple a day and growing. I know I am not supposed to because it causes more bleeds, but there is not anything that helps that does not cause bleeds and I am theoretically prophy anyway &lt;shrug&gt;. The last year I have begun trying to strengthen my ankles by doing various exercises given to me by PTs and walking more, but it causes the pain to increase. I do think it overall helps because I can walk more now than I could before, but I am in far more day to day pain. RICE is kind of a joke. I elevate 90% of the time I am not at work, Ice hurts, compression causes bleeding and resting causes degradation.\n\nI started going to a pain clinic and they have given questionable ideas. They suggest going to PT even though I am doing PT. Electric Muscle Stimulation even though I am not having Muscle issues, Steroids, lidocaine on my ankles (and Vaseline to stop it from being messy instead of tagederm wtf?), and lidocaine injections. Out of that lidocaine injections seems the most promising but they seem hesitant to actually do it and will not let me self inject for some reason. Honestly I feel like the Pain Doctor is treating someone entirely different, I also feel like they do not believe that I am actually in pain and am just trying to scare me out of seeing them and are baffled that I keep coming back asking for help.\n\nI am pretty much at the end of my rope. I am constantly aggravated with doctors because they offer nothing that can help short term, they only offer the 5 year plan which I am already on. And ultimately I get that and agree that you want long term solutions more than short term, but I really feel like I need something short term to get me to the long term. What does it help to save things like fusing, replacements, pain killers (and I guess I am too young for the steroids too, not sure why they suggested it), for when I am older if my chances of getting to an older age diminish with each painful year... Have you considered trying medical marijuana if it is available in your area? It is one of the few things that have actually helped for me. Definitely takes away the pain and lessens inflammation, as well.  I never understood how much my shoulder was always hurting until my wife and I traveled to Seattle and I had some high-CBD marijuana. It is crazy how good it is for my joint pain. Unfortunately I am in Texas where even letting children have CBD oil to control seizures does not have unanimous approval by state legislators, so medical marijuana seems far away for me.  Fuck, is this what I am going to be dealing with in 20 years? I am sorry man. It is a real bitch to deal with. I am factor 8 deficient. Less than 1 percent. I would suggest going somewhere where you can buy it recreationally and see if it does anything for you.    If so, pack it up well, mail it back to yourself.   I have heard of LOTS of people doing this, but never tried it myself.    The oils and concentrates are VERY small in size, and I imagine would very easy to hide in your car, or even on a plane - think shampoo bottle?\n\nNow, putting that topic aside, I am 40.  Yea bro.  I feel your pain.   The short and brutal answer is there is no answer.   The opiates work because we are in a shitton of pain because we have the joints of 90 year olds.   There is nothing that can be done for that.   As far as your left ankle goes, getting an ankle fusion was the best thing I ever done.   You are lucky your knees are in relatively good shape.   I lucky there too, even those a big chunk of my childhood was spent doing RICE on my knees before the at home 10cc miracle in a shot we could give ourselves at home came.    I think that was around 94 or 95 for me.    As far as the elbows go... I feel ya there too.  Be thankful you do not need them to walk.   We have to count our lucky stars, I suppose.\n\nBut yea....  it is sad because the docs do not want to be honest with us, or they simply do not understand that bleeding into joints, like us older bleeders do, really messes things up.   They just do not consider it.   Just do not get addicted to the opiates.   I am able to not become addicted, and use them for when the times are really bad.   But the important thing is to NOT use them when you have a muscle bleed... cuz man...  that is asking for lots of trouble. I feel ya brother. I am in pretty much the same exact boat, but you are a few years ahead of me. I take Celebrex daily and I have being taking 10 to 40 mg of oxycodone (depending on the kind of day I am having and the weather) for the last 10 years or so. When I was still only a couple years into it I struggled a bit with taking more than I should, but anytime I take more than my normal dose and go above my tolerance level I get insanely itchy, which is pretty much what has allowed me to regulate my usage so reliably and not develop a problem. \n\nIbuprofen works great for me too, but i usually only take it right after i factor up. Pot is great. Does not lessen pain like the oxy does, more makes it easier to tolerate. I do not care as much. Plus maybe an anti-inflammatory effect, idk. I live in mass where we have had medical for a while now, but my htc will not/ cannot prescribe it. I have been smoking it since high school though so it is whatever. I wish i could give advice on where to get some but i do not really have any. Just ask people you think might smoke. They probably do. Ibuprofen works better for pain, but pot is still worth trying imho.\n\nI have had three synovectomies now on three of my four target joints - ankles and elbows, with mixed results. The thing with the steroid injections is that you end up using your crappy join a lot more than you would without the injections so in the span of the year which is about all you will probably get out of it in terms of relief, you do more damage then you normally would, thereby shortening the life of your joint. I suspect that is why they are hesitant to give you them. One of my surgeons offered it as a short-term relief until I got a synovectomy, but I did not end up trying it.\n\nI got a tens unit a while back. Its good for when the pain is pretty bad and you are not moving around a lot. It kind of hurts a bit itself but you just have to find the right placement for the pads till it does not sting too much. It kind of just blocks the pain signals in your nerves by giving them something else to hurt about but there is different settings and strengths and for how cheap it is it is definitely worth giving a shot.\n\nThe tens i have: \n All depends on how well you treat you joints when you are young. And a lot of luck i suppose. Good times.  I have just come to grips that I am just going to live in pain for the rest of my life. I only see the dr once every two years. Just for my prescription refill.  They never tell me anything I do not already know. One time they gave me pain meds to cope with either a bad bleed or if I just needed to ease the daily pain. Last time I went they said they do not do that anymore and just take Tylenol or Advil if the pain got bad. I have had a synovectomy on my elbow and it was a bad idea. My arm has not been the same since. My target joints are my ankles and they are beyond fucked. It hurts just walking around. I feel your pain sir. Man I have really come to rely on my oxy. Usually take it twice a day and I am still in pain. I hate to think about working every day without it, even at my desk job.  Weed does not help with this type of pain for most people. It is one step away from just telling someone to take a tylenol. \n\nIllinois it is only level with certain, and EXACT, conditions. The closest that is covered is rheumatoid arthritis. When we have he hemophilic arthropathy. We would have to request for a state medical board approval, then have hemophilic arthropathy written into the state law before we would be fully covered. I do believe they added a \"unlisted, but bad\" section, but we would still be stuck with going through a state medical board for approval.\n\nAlso, if you were lucky enough to be put on opioids for pain in Illinois, you cannot take weed. They test you constantly (at least I am) and if I was to test positive for anything else, I am kicked out of the pain program. I am about the same age. I treated my joints with reckless abandon when younger because I figured I would be dead by now. But, I am still here and I am paying for it like you.\n\nI have been on just about every pain med out there and I am in a pain program that will last the rest of my life, so I guess it is a plus. I had a pain dr that had me on a lot of stupid things like the TEMS crap (which does not work at all for severe joint damage). He even wanted me to pay $700 for a home version.\n\nThere are major drawbacks. For starters, I/we throw off doctors for their normal routine. Every pain dr. I have gone to were afraid the amounts I needed would cause red flags with the state agencies, so I would be prescribed less than what I should. Also, having to deal with clinics that have no clue about hemophilia and would constantly try prescribing stuff with asprin.\nNext, would be the amount I have been given was/is never close enough to be \"pain free\" but lucky enough to just take the edge off at best.\nFinally, if you are pain doctor leaves for some reason, you are stuck without your prescriptions and have to deal with withdrawal on top of the increased pain. The withdrawal is a billion times worse. I have had to find pain doctors that are a three hour found trip from where I have lived. I have finally got one near to me.\n\nOther than that, I do not know what to tell you. I have had to go on disability because it effects my major joints in all my arms and legs. I try not to move much, which is the only thing that REALLY helps. You just have to keep chugging on until you can find a Dr that will work with you. Have you been profy for most of your life? If so, then no...probably not.\n\nThe older guys like us were never (or almost never) put on profy. Factor was really hard to come by when we were younger so we only were able to treat when we had bleeds. I had to have surgeries since I was 10 due to damage from bleeding. Around the early 20s was when I had a hard time getting around and late 20s i started getting replacement surguries.\n\nSo for the younger generations that have been on plentiful, man made factor and on profy, you should be fine. Careful with the Oxy dude.  Do not get addicted  Ya well like i said in another comment, I have been taking pretty much the same dose for just over a decade. I definitely rely on it, but i can honestly say i have not taken it in a manner that could be considered abuse in 7 years or so. I have struggled a lot more with addiction when it comes to cannabis than opiates. Go figure eh?  I do not mean to sound like I am lecturing.  I am sure you have it handled.   \n\nWe all have to look out for each other though.   Its all good. I know a couple other bleeders who have developed problems and its a big issue these days. I feel lucky i have not gone down that road myself.  Have you tried Arcoxia? It is a step up from Celecoxib. Try taking the 60 or 90 mg version for 2-3 weeks and see if you notice any difference. It is a long lasting thing, so it might take a while to kick in properly. I am surprised you are not considering a more permanent solution. I am 39 too, and was in the same boat, but in 2004 I said FUCK THIS and got both ankles fused. Best decision I ever made.    I am not sure how much this will help but I am 32, started prophy for severe A around when I was 7 or 8?, have had 3 surgeries (synovectomies on each ankle and an ulnar nerve relocation on my right elbow). Used hydrocodone on and off for a while too.\n\nI have been on the Hemlibra trial for nearly a year and it is night and goddamned day when it comes to residual joint pain. The stuff that hurts when you are fighting to keep your levels above 3% does not when your levels are practically around 10% by default.\n\nFor example I went to a good old mosh pit show a couple weeks ago - first time I would gone in over a year and since I would started the trial. Felt totally different, even from the shows when I was in my early 20s and felt invincible anyway. Sure I was out of practice and sore as hell for the next week, but it did not *hurt* as much.\n\nGranted I still get enough pain from my older wounds that I might consider MMJ if, on a cold day in hell, it ever becomes legal in Japan. But I would def. recommend looking at the new treatment methods that are coming out. How did your ankles become so bad? Did you play sports or anything growing up or did you sprain them at all doing physical activity? I am curious to know how they became so bad because I am 23 and have sprained mine a few times in the past. Definitely one of if not my main target joint. Are you severe/moderate or what?  (  Lots of pain doctors are used to terminally ill people and people with fibromyalgia.\n\nAre you seeing an HTC hematologist?  That would be my first thought.\nSecond, if you are seeing a hemophilia specialist, have they referred you to an orthopedic surgeon for assessment of your ankles?   Kids who are now your age were some of the last to get trashed ankles and by 39 years, the osteoarthritis process may have put you in line for replacement.", "Fitness regiments Anyone here who might be a tad overweight? What kind of exercises do you use? After tearing my soas for the third time this August I had to really think about what I do for fitness. I usually do about twenty minutes of moderate resistance on a recumbent bike (I prefer an elliptical but I need to build my quad back up) followed by about twenty minutes of weight training. I end with stretching, but I *only* do stretches that my hematologist and physical therapist tell me to do, because it was actually yoga that made me tear my soas the last time it happened.\n\nSquats and deadlifts are fun to me and can really help with strength, you just need to perfect the form before going up in weight. My physical therapist also thinks rowing is good for us, and I think every hematology clinic will tell us to swim.\n\nThe most important thing is to find something that you do not dread doing, so you can more easily keep up the habit. I got into playing squash about ten years ago which was in a gym, so I also started running while I was there...it slowly made exercise a part of my daily routine because I just love squash. Before that I could never keep up a routine. *regimen\n\nI have no haemophilia-related problem with exercise. I played rugby union at school. \n\nI just cannot stick with it.... I just got into a drop-in 30 minute HIIT training place that has been doing me well. Mostly bodyweight training and low impact. They let you stay longer after your session where I usually do some heavier lifting.\n\nI also play hockey 3-5 times a week.\n\nFor some reason I am still heavier than I want to be. God I love pizza. What sort of stretches do you do? Can you provide a list? This is something I do very little of. I do the standard stretches I learned through Hockey. I know these are not enough for me though.\n\nI have thought about getting into yoga but this makes me second guess it a bit. A lot of it is specific to the joint issues I have. The most important one right now is stretching my quads with a dog leash. I lay prone, wrap it around my foot and bend as the knee for 15 seconds, three times. I also do leg raises while supine, prone and on my side. I sometimes do knee raises with resistance, but it can be difficult to find an easy way to add that resistance.\n\nFor my shoulder I also use the leash, putting my arm behind my back and pulling it up. I also have a rod I use to bend it at the elbow to the side and upward, and also raise my shoulder up (think a signal for touchdown), and also rotate it like I am making snow angels. \n\nThese are all pretty specific to my problems though. I also do resistance band stuff that helps loosen my shoulder and the bike or elliptical keep my quads and calves feeling good, too. In general I am just supposed to avoid stressing my soas by flexing my hip so my leg moves behind my torso. Leg raises while prone are about as far as I go there, but squats and deadlifts also help flexibility there a little more passively. I will promote r/keto here for a minute. It has helped me keep my weight down without having to ramp up my physical activity to try and do the same. Been eating keto for the past 2 years, and it has helped immensely, not just reducing weight, but other unexpected benefits like not having major nosebleeds anymore.\n\nI try to walk regularly but due to the condition of my elbows, there is not a whole lot of strength training I can do. Keto + walking has been a great combo.", "Hemotologist is taking me off Alprolix. Starting Rebinyn in the new year. Anyone here taking Rebinyn? I guess Alprolix is too expensive. They are going to use it exclusively for kids under 18 here in Canada from now on. Which is understandable. I was just wondering what I can expect from Rebinyn? I really, really loved Alprolix, i have not had any severe bleeds in almost a year. When I was on Benefix I would get one every month.. Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated. Never heard of it. I am on Adynovate and treating twice a week as a type A severe. No breakthrough bleeds It looks like Rebinyn and Alprolix are Factor IX, type B products.  I did not recognize them either so I looked them up to see what I have been missing. Hopefully some 9ers can give you the scoop OP. It is a glycopeglylated factor 9 extended half life agent.  It is not used in the US in kids (on label), but is used in adults.  There is concern that the PEG molecule from the Novo products may not clear the body as well as smaller ones do.  Not clear that this is true and studies are on going, with discrepancies between human and small mammal studies (more uptake in animal models).\n\nSo far, it seems to work ok in adults.  Why Canada has decided to block your use of Alprolix is unknown to me. Previously, on /r/Hemophilia\n\n(\n\n( Thanks man, I will read up on that PEG issue.  Canadian as well. My son is still on Alprolix weekly but after a year of use the last few months have had a lot of breakthrough bleeds. \n\nMy adult cousin was on Alprolix and was told he would be switching to Rebinyn as well. He declined with the PEG concerns and went back to ImmuNine a few times per week. \n\nWhen we asked our clinic director here about the PEG he said that yes it does store in body (brain), but it reaches a maximum point and does eventually clear. Will not build up endlessly is what I mean. There are other drugs currently given bound to PEG however the frequency is a lot less than once per week that Rebinyn would be. \n\nNew drugs are in the pipeline though, short term Rebinyn use should not be a worry if there are other options on the horizon. Seems like a new product every year or two now. I am looking forward to the subcutaneous factor 9 that is in trials while they give the gene therapy time to figure itself out with long term studies. Side note on cost in Canada, Alprolix is a little over $2/unit,. BeneFix is about $1/unit, and Rebinyn is close to $1.25/unit (PEG is cheap to produce) Canada blood service dropped the contract since there was a cheaper option with similar to better coverage. In Canada if CBS drops it there is pretty well no way to get it. Definitely was unexpected with the PEG concerns.  Is ( available? Approved but not contracted by CBS. My guess is Rebinyn will switch over to Idelvion next contract since half life is doubled.

Hey, so I am a hemophilia b severe, right ankle is my main target joint and it is really been bothering me lately with some days being chronic pain and me only able to be on my feet for half an hour or so at a time. Currently I have just been wrapping it in an ace bandage as needed but that is not cutting it anymore, I was wondering if there were any suggestions for shoes, insoles, or braces that anyone uses or has used. Do you have access to insurance? My husband is also type B and has ankle issues. He gets custom made orthotics and that helps significantly. Your family doctor should be able to make a referral. \n\nIf not, Dr Scholls has some good insoles for a more reasonable price.  I have prolapsed arches which gave me knee problems and use superfeet insoles, but depending on how severe it is you probably need some type of custom orthotics. My HTC sent me to a specialist in prosthetics, but they were straight forward with me and had me try something off the shelf to correct the problem before trying something custom. Just check with your doctor and get their opinion on options.  I let the knee pain get bad and put it off when I just needed new insoles. I had a bad ankle for a few years in my early 20s until my HTC recommended a Swede-O. It is a pain to lace up but it worked really well. I was able to run, pivot, participate in active athletics with no issues.\n\n ( Personally, the way my Ankle works is that I cannot bend it forward without pain, and even if I ignore the pain, the movement is limited. I have two solutions from my HTC. \n\nThe first is a Heel lift shoe insert. It just raises my heel up by a half-inch, which raises the 'nuetral' position. That artificially gains me some forward bending movement.\n\nThe second is a ToeOff brand prosthetic. Carbon fiber, very light. It prevents your ankle from bending much, AND helps you walk correctly. My ankle was making me walk poorly, I did not have the  strength to really 'follow through', and my bad foot just sort of shuffle along. The ToeOff helps with this movement, by capturing momentum from your heel landing to help lift-off.\n\nAlso, wear compression sleeves as much as you can stand, proactively. My mistake was only putting them on when I was hurting. Make sure you get sleeves, compression socks are different. Ankles used to be my target joint until I switched to Clark shoes. There is always one model that is totally flat inside and outside.  I have got pretty bad arthritis in both ankles and have had surgery on one, so I am fairly familiar with most OTC ankle braces. The ones I have had the best luck with are the type that are lace up along with two straps that cross the top of your foot. They can be a little finicky to get them tight enough to help but loose enough so it does not pinch your foot or affect circulation.\n\nBetween that and a  sturdy hiking boot, that will usually get me through the day for when I need to be active. A cane is also a huge help (except when you are elbow arthritis is flaring up too).\n\nCompression sleeves do not do crap for me, and Ace wraps are not much better. Heel lifts can be helpful if your range of motion is pretty bad. I have just started using them on my bad days.\n\n Try an aircast. ", "Anyone in NYC?

Ended up \"only\" costing a few thousand total, but I know for severe hemophiliacs the cost could be a million a year pre insurance. Is it tough to get insurance coverage for infusions as a severe hemophiliac?", "Switching from Advate to Hemlibra Hi! \n\nI just wanted to ask those who have made the switch, what was the process like? After your initial loading dose for the 4 weeks did you have to go back in for blood tests or check ups? Or is it like the Dr just gives you the doses and instructions on how to continue?\n\nThanks! I switched last October, fun fact, normal blood tests will no longer work, bc it can cause weird figures to show up, but they have a special test they can run to get actual numbers.\n\nSo you will have to carry a card to call the center bc if you are in an accident or go to the hospital they will freak out lol.\n\nI go to the Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, they made it super easy, barely an inconvenience. First visit I went, they did like a 45 mins lecture and test, and then sent a nurse to my house for the other loading doses. \n\nIt is so much simpler than advate, you will laugh at how easy it is. It is basically just an insulin needle shot in the belly once every 2 weeks. \n\nI did not have to go for any blood tests after that. You will still keep a couple doses of advate on hand for breakthroughs. Helimbra is cool in that when you do normal factor, it backs off, and then goes back to working when the advate wears off. \n\nWhich I have only had to use advate twice I think since Oct bc I fucked my back up really bad. \n\nIt does take getting used to.. you do not have the high days of normal factor, it is more a constant steady. So there was many times I would feel stiff and sore, and think I need to infuse. \n\nBut you do not got to, you learn to trust that your body is going to heal. The hardest part is learning new limits bc you will be able to do more, and you will accidentally over do it. Like I did with my back lol Do you have inhibitors? Wondering if there is a difference in that scenario. Nope, but Helimbra was actually originally designed as a treatment for ppl who had inhibitors, that they found worked for everyone Thanks. That is good to know. No problem, if you have any other questions feel free to ask. \n\nEveryone is different of course, but for me, I have kind of been kicking myself for not getting on it sooner. Like I actually forget I have to even take a shot anymore. My wife usually has to remind me every 2 weeks. It is just such a quality of life improvement not having to infuse. Wow that is so great to hear! Was there a specific reason they had to send a nurse to do the loading doses rather than you do it yourself?\n\nYour answers are so helpful btw, thank you! Thank you. I definitely will.\n\nHemophilia not covered by insurance in my country. Actually, all genetic disorder and other rare diseases are not. But there are some small special programs that gives some patients. \n\nHoping to get on one of them soon. Technically you used to have to go the clinic for all the loading doses, but my clinic started sending nurses to help out so ppl were less inconvenienced. \n\nPlus, some patients are homeless, and travel is a huge issue, so the nurses even go to places like public libraries they said to make sure ppl get help.\n\n The loading dose visits are just going over the details of the medicine every time, and you take a short quiz. Basically it is just to make sure you are being loaded correctly, understanding the new medicine, and bc everyone is different, if something weird does pop up, they are there. \n\nSurpringly, my nurse said some ppl have a lot of trouble with sticking a tiny needle in their gut. Mental thing usually.. I had no qualms bc after intravenous for 37 years, this was a snap. \n\nYou will get the choice of taking it once a week, every 2 weeks, or once a month. I went every 2 weeks bc once a month I felt like it would be even easier to forget. Great!! Thank you so much for all your answers! Really appreciate it :) I have been without insurance before, so I can relate a tad bit. Luckily those programs exist, and helped out when I needed it. My treatment center tries it is best to help out in other countries as well. They always remind patients to bring in expired factor, bc even though it is expired by FDA rules, it is still usable, and will donate it to other countries for ppl who can use it. \n\nThe great thing about Helimbra is it is even got a monthly dose option, which is so much easier to get help with bc you do not need tons of it like Advate or other factors. It is no problem :)\n\nTbh, I was really scared to try it, new type of medicine and all is always scary, and put it off for a couple years. I really wish I had not bc it is been amazing at preventing micro and minor bleeds.. \n\nDid not help when it first came out, there was a lot of misinformation. Lots of money to be made in the hemophilia field, so I would read a horror story. \n\nLuckily, my hemophilia doctor is one of the leading experts in the world. We had lots of convos, over those 2 years, explained what really happened in the extremely rare bad cases, my specific health, and did not pressure me. She let me make the decision on my own. I have been asking for my husband. Cause we are living in the Philippines right now but he is flying back to CA for a check up next week and is switching to Hemlibra, so just wanted to know what to expect :) My wife's best friend is from there, just sent us some soda pop called Sarsi I think is made there? Have not tried it yet though. \n\nAnyways, hoping for safe travels and the appointment and the switch goes well! Do not know much about the treatment centers in CA but hopefully they take great care of him :) \n\nFeel free to message with any questions after he switches. It is definitely a weird transition mentally. For me it was basically switching from severe to mild hemophilia. Which has been a big life adjustment. Those donations reach us, eventually. \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 Some patients have direct channels to centers and get them. How active are you? I am currently on Advate as a severe factor 8 and I am quite active (sports and weight lifting). Have you noticed any bleeds with regards to being more active? I know Hemlibra levels are equivalent to around 14% compared to say the high of 50ish you get with an infusion of Advate. I think you need to reply to r/GbHaseo to get him to see your question. I am severe A and have been on Hemlibra for a year and a half or so. I am very active as well (ride dirtbikes and exercise a lot and all that) and I went from infusing almost every day before Hemlibra, and now I only need to use factor a few times a month. Usually for injuries. When I switched to Hemlibra I also started being more active and pushing myself so I had a few more serious bleeds (twisted ankle, elbow bleeds, hurt shoulder, etc. The other day I got a blood blister on my tongue and it popped and was bleeding like crazy and would not stop until I did factor and it stopped right away. Factor seems to work better on Hemlibra too. Probably because the bleeds do not get as bad. I am not as active as you most likely are. I do low impact stuff, swimming, bike, low weight high reps with weights. I have a 6yr I chase around a lot as well as mowing, home construction, etc. I have a total replacement knee and hip, and a few target joints. \n\nThe only bleed I have had since switching was a bad back bleed in March, but that was mostly my fault bc I did not recognize it. Which is the toughest part of Helimbra is realizing bleeds. \n\nYou do not have the highs of Advate, which does suck, at first but you sacrifice for a more steady low level. Then when my bleed did pop up, I just took advate for it. \n\nMy men's group has a couple athletes, but we have not been able to meet up the past year bc of Covid, so I cannot really ask them how they have been on it. I am 16yo and made the switch about a year ago, and I have had nothing but success with it. Now with that being said it is even more critical that you do not miss any doses. We had a problem with our insurance and could not get medicine so I had to miss a dose and I got a bad bad hip bleed so the one thing I would stress the most is to get a set day and never miss it. My bleed count has gone down so much since the switch, wish they would have had it around when I was younger", "Efficacy of rFIXFc versus rIX-FP for the Treatment of Patients with Hemophilia B: Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of B-LONG and PROLONG-9FP Trials ", "Pfizer and Sangamo Announce Updated Phase 1/2 Results Showing Sustained Factor VIII Activity Levels in 3x1013 VG/KG Cohort Through One Year Following Hemophilia A Gene Therapy  ( &gt;All five patients in the high dose 3 x 1013 vg/kg cohort have had at least one year of follow-up and showed sustained factor VIII (FVIII) activity levels, with a group median FVIII activity of 56.9% and a group geometric mean FVIII activity of 70.4% via chromogenic assay from week 9 to 52. \n\nSo three shots of this stuff and your VIII levels are sustained at something like 50-70%?

What keeps them from full blown panic mode is that the factor 8 gene trials are still a long way away and that no one has developed a technique for doing lifelong gene therapy in a baby/small boy.  \n\nWho ever figures that out will cure hemophilia in the first world.  The factor companies will have a declining market and third world conditions to market into for most of the factor market will shift there. I hope so.  At 42 I honestly could not care less about a cure for myself.  I keep enough factor pumped in me that I rarely have a bleed these days.  That is almost as good as a cure since I treated an average of 10 bleeds per month the first 35 years of my life.  Joint regeneration or ankle/elbow prosthesis would do me more good.  But I would definitely love to see little kids get cured and go through life not knowing what a bleed is or having joints fail prematurely.  I decided to skip having kids just to avoid potentially passing it on to future generations.  I guess it is part of being human but seeing somebody else suffer bothers me more than if I am dealing with pain.  At any rate, I am all for it, sooner than later hopefully.  I guess if we figure out gene therapy it will be a hell of a lot bigger than hemophilia.  I would not mind seeing it happen in my lifetime whether I get to try it or not.  Hemophilia and Sickle cell will lead the way in gene therapy given the money at state in hemophilia and the delicacy of sickle cell's gene therapy (one false move and you give the patient leukemia.)  The goal would be to get a vector that can go into a cell that grows with the child, but does not lose the exome as daughter cells form.  That is the barrier to child gene therapy now.  The kids respond like adults.  The liver makes the clotting factor and the immune system makes the antivector antibody (like it does in adults).  The levels go up and all is well until the boy grows  a bit.  Then the factor level falls as the exome does not go forward into new daughter cells. &gt;the factor 8 gene trials are still a long way away\n\n( Factor 8 gene trials are starting, but several years behind 9.

The Phase 3 GENEr8-1 study will include 130 participants and is expected to be fully enrolled in the third quarter of 2019.\nDraft guidelines published by the FDA in 2018 on the development of gene therapy products for the treatment of hemophilia outlined a potential accelerated approval path forward applicable to valoctocogene roxaparvovec. The Company announced in January 2019 that it had completed enrollment of the initial cohort of patients in its Phase 3 program that would be included in a potential accelerated submission.

I was thinking that if you are maintaining prophylaxis, then it cannot be dangerous. But I am still curious.

The danger comes when you mix alcohol with other medications or supplements that are also blood thinners.  Well it may not cause you to spontaneously bleed, but in my experience when I drank in my younger days. I would dose up the night of. I would always be fairly sure the next day.

I drew some blood back in to the syringe to make sure everything worked okay. No redness or swelling, so I guess everything went where it was supposed to? Good job! Life is much easier when you are able to infuse yourself. :) I do not understand how you went 10 years without being treated.\n\nMake sure you try using 27G butterfly needles.

It takes time and practice but after you get comfortable with self treatment it makes a lot of things in life more convenient and doable :)  request the narrower needles from your homecare company.  They really do feel less painful.  Going to 30 gauge is too narrow and it will take longer to infuse.  27gauge is better than 25 for avoiding trashing a readily accessed vein. Just checked. I have been using the 25G's that came with the Nuwiq box. So far so good, though. I will check out the 27G if I run into any trouble. Do not want the ones that come with the box to go to waste. If 25g works, keep using them.  Adults tend to have bigger veins.  My ped patients tend to start self infusion at 7-8 and 27g works better for them.\n\nAlso, consider one of your easiest veins as your \"CPR vein\".  No one gets to access you for any reason from that vein unless you are extremely ill or having a massive bleed and you cannot get it.  This vein will be in good shape for that time you need to treat and are struggling with your normal sites. No bleeds, nothing over 10 years that would have required an infusion, even with a drinking problem?\n\n Obviously I had bleeds, both knees being the weakest points. I took cyklokapron for bleeds and diclofenac for any inflammatory issues. Definitely find yourself a better butterfly! It might seem fine to you right now, but if you start doing it more often, like prophy, you will want something nice like a turemo 27g sureglide. They are amazing. I am proud of you!

Keep it up. \ud83d\udc4d The only advice I can give you is to take your butterfly needles and stretch the tubing out really well before you use them.

Long post here...\n\nCelebrex a prescription anti-inflammatory helps me a ton, weed can be very helpful, but it is not for everyone. There is also some things like anti-depressants thatve been shown to relieve pain.\n\nBe careful with opioids if you meant those kinds of pills, but low doses can help. They can take the edge off occasionally, or help you through an important day. You need to keep them low dose and you got to have great self control and not use them all the time. Maybe bed time, and important events, bleeds.\n\nThings like Tylenol 3, Norco, are not too bad bc they can be given at lower dosages. Stay away from Oxycontin, Methadone, Morphine, or anything strong. Not only are they addicting, but you will build a tolerance, and as you become really old, you will likely end up needing them, and they will not be effective.\n\nAnother thing that helps are ace wraps, and extra cushions in your shoes.

If you do choose to go this route (assuming you already have an outdoor bike), you will be looking at something like a ( With bike trainers you can spend a lot of money and get attachments that will come inside of them, like cadence sensors, some even have software that will emulate a bicycle race on your tv, etc. ( makes some really good indoor bicycle trainers. I use a magnetic trainer so this is what I am most familiar with. \n\nI would watch out for anything that is driven using rubber bands as these will eventually wear out and break, usually on the cheaper indoor exercise bikes.

The other thing I would suggest looking in to would be to see if there is any funding for exercise devices through your bleeding disorder clinic. In Ontario, Canada, there are a couple of types of funding that hemophiliacs can apply for, one of them being specifically for ( So, look into it at the very least because they may be willing to help you with some type of funding.

There are special exercises for ROM and strengthening that they use these bikes for.  If you are going to drop that kind of money, check first. Hey man browse your Craigslist for gym closures.

If you are having a bleed it is a medical emergency and I am sure the hospital will treat you with out parental consent. Your mom obviously does not understand hemophilia. I got regular treatments as a child and at 21 years old my right elbow at times hurts like hell despite having regular treatments all those years.

You will get treated as this can be a life threatening event as you can lose a substantial amount of blood into the space you are bleeding into.  When you were little, these bleeds were annoying, but now that you are bigger, the volume in play is enough to be a threat to your life.

Alright... might try heading to the school health center.

Painkillers are only good for relieving muscle sprains and aches. Useless in bleeding.\n\nAlso avoid those painkiller tablets and creams with aspirin (salicylate (how to spell) acid) as that is aspirin and will worsen bleeding.  See if you can qualify for a free trial. Usually there is a competitor to your factor willing to give a few doses for free.\n\nOn top of ice and elevation, compression is honestly key to stopping a bleed from continuing to grow. If there is not enough room for the blood to bleed, it will stop bleeding. If you have a medical wrap like an ace bandage, use it. ", "Humate-P I have Vonwillibrand disease. I had an appointment with my local hemophilia center this morning. I am being taken off of DDAVP and put on Humate-P that will be taken at home once a week using my central line. Is it actually a blood product where the factor comes from someone else? \n\nDoes anyone have advice on what to expect once I start taking the humate? Hemophiliac here, but Humate P is a plasma derived factor VIII / von willdebrand protein product. Is should do a better job of controlling bleeding etc. than desmopressin. Do you have any particular concerns? I personally have only used it in emergency situations, but I was on grifols alphanate for many years which is a very similar product. Do you have any particular concerns? A lot of the people I know with vonwilibrands take humate P and it works really well for them. Expect to not have as many bleeds, and other than that, nothing. Even tho it is a blood product the way they test for impurities and then heat treat the product insures it is safe. I am hoping it works better than the Desmopressin and has less side effects. I could not restrict fluids correctly when I took the Desmopressin so we think it was dropping sodium levels and that was causing issues with one of my other diseases and that disease was what required the fluids. \n\nI am a bit confused as to why I took the Desmopressin as need but the humate he wants taken weekly. And then just wonder if the over all safeness of it being a blood product and if it would cause any kind of allergic reaction. Should not expect much/anything in the way of side effects. Humate will just be directly replacing the protein that your body is missing. He probably wants you on weekly prophy to get your symptoms under control, you will find that your quality of life will improve taking it routinely I suspect. \n\nAs for the blood product bit... The chance of allergic reaction should be pretty minimal (about the same as any other IV drug). The main added risk is Infectiois disease, but coming from an engineer that has worked on fractionation processes at both grifols and baxter/shire/takeda that risk really is very very minimal. Almost non-existent. \n\nTalk to your physician about your concerns. But I personally  think not dealing with the desmopressin side effects will be worth it. I am really hoping it helps with my bleeds. I have horrible nose bleeds that the Desmopressin was not really helping with. There is other bleeds bug the nose is a major culprit I have been on Humate since I was 9 or so and I am 33 now. Humate is human derived, but heat treated 2x so it is very safe. The only side effects I have ever felt have been slight headache, tingling as it enters my veins, and slight fatigue afterwards. Most can probably be caused by me pushing it in too fast, so I only have myself to blame!  It would be great to get my bleeds under control. Right now even with the DDAVP Im having nosebleeds pretty frequently and pretty long ones and my feeding tube constantly bleeds. There is times it makes me feel awful. Weak, dizzy, tired, foggy cognitively and pretty close to passing out. Plus I am constantly anemic/iron deficient. Used it for years! (Severe VWD - DDAVP does nothing for me). Right now I am using recombinant VWD as prophylaxis- have to say might ask to go back to Humate-P as it is a smaller volume to inject! \n\nHonestly do not think I remember it having any effect. You can feel it being injected but it is not an unpleasant feeling, just a little cool. When I have used it to stop a bleed it actually just makes me feel better as does not take long to have an effect. I get lucky in the area of injecting it because I have a central line so a lot of the side effects are gotten rid of by the line letting everything out into one chamber of my heart diluting it so much I do not have a ton of side effects. Most meds make me hot/cold feeling or taste but nothing like a normal IV. I just started taking Humate P (instead of desmopressin / DDAVP) as well! The worst I have had happen is a mild headache and some bruising / pain near the area I had it administered. It is been very helpful with bleeds though :) Hello! 2B here. I cannot take DDAVP because it makes my platelet count go way down. But humate is great! Basically no side effects, and as long as you also put pressure/basic first aid on the wound, humate pretty much instantly stops the bleed! And yes, humate is basically healthy von Willebrand factor with some factor VIII and platelets mixed in, from donors. It is expensive, but worth it! Also I noticed you said you have really bad nosebleeds in the comments. Are you packing your nose? Before my family started learning about nasal first aid, even humate did basically nothing. I recommend using afrin nasal spray, aquaphor, and hemostatic nosebleed plugs! You probably already know this stuff, but I thought I would let you know anyway because it is SO IMPORTANT. Best of luck! Omg other people can feel the coldness? I thought that was just me \ud83d\ude33 Hello! We finally got partial approval for me to use humate so I had my first dose before Surgery on Tuesday at the hospital and a minor bleed dose today and I have to say I am happy with it. The bleeding stopped and I did not have any side effects. \n\nI am a bit salty though because my insurance will only approve the humate to be taken after a bleed starts rather than giving it to prevent bleeding like my doctor wanted. He was wanting me to take a dose weekly as a scheduled dose and then also have access to doses for major/minor breakthrough bleeding. From what I understood he felt like my quality of life would be better if we prevented me from bleeding rather than me just taking it to \u201cput out the fire\u201d once I start bleeding. \n\nI pack my nose to the best of my ability. My nose bleeds are just super heavy so I bleed through the gauze very very quickly. I have a bloody nose and it looks like I murdered someone. I will have to look into the nasal spray and nosebleed plugs. I do use Aimcar in my nose. I also have a really bad time with blood running down my throat (sometimes from a normal nose bleed or just by itself) and it makes me so nauseated, gag, vomit, covers my mouth in a film of blood, and I spit out huge clots that are not formed correctly. It makes me miserable for the rest of the day if not longer and yet insurance will not pay to prevent this. Just to stop it. I do have the humate sent to me to administer at home. As horrible as this sounds I am half tempted to take it like my doctor had it written. Yeah, that insurance thing sound pretty horrible. I hope you get things worked out.", "Experience with Prophylaxis Hi all, I have a question about the quality of life one can expect while being on prophylaxis. \n\nI like most of the others happen to suffer from severe Hemophilia A. Prophylaxis was not much of an option for most of my life and I was generally treated on-demand only when the pain from my bleeds would become unbearable. This in turn has severely affected my right knee as well as both of my shoulders. I would suffer from very frequent bleeds in those joints, like 2-3 times every month. I am in my mid 20's now and it is only recently that I got the opportunity to avail prophylactic treatment. I thought life on prophylaxis would be completely bleed-free but it does not seem to be the case for me at the moment. I still occasionally do suffer from bleeds in my above mentioned target joints, though might not be as major as they used to be before, but they still do give me a hard time. It is true that I have been more active ever since I got on my schedule which is about infusing 1500 IU every other day but I am still far away from being \"semi-normal\". Not sure if it is because of the poor condition of my joints or it is just the harsh reality of being a hemophiliac? Hey man, I have been on prophylaxis most of my life, since I was about 5. I still got and get break through bleeds, my target joint do not seem to heal and I have permanent damage in my ankle. My target joints all feel weak and really  prone to re bleeding. I cannot run, I have only recently been able to do normal walking since they have me on pain killers which double as an anti inflammatory. This all started when I was 18 when I switched to a new product since then I have tried a few different ones and they work much better. I am 20 now and trying to get back my quality of life I had when I was younger, since I cannot run. I used to work out but now that is out of the question too cause I have a target joint on each limb that is really to bleed lol. I do not know how well 1500 works  for you but I seem to need 3000 with all products.  Also my doctor said that if you were treated on prophylaxis after 5 then you will still get joint damage due to micro bleeds? This a new concept that they have been telling me this past year Hey bud, I feel your pain! I am 26 now start prophylactic treatment when I was around 11 but I tried to be rebellious in my teens a decided treating on demand was better for me at that time!\n\n\nObviously that did not work out and still have arthritis in my hands and problem joints from previous bleeds. \n\nThe way I see it is I cannot undo the damage that has been done through the haemophilia but the prophylaxis stops any mate damage happening! \n\n\nI am in the middle of trying to raise awareness for haemophilia and to start a dialog between all us haeomos! Something I doubt we all had when we were younger, so please check out Unclottable on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\n\nI am happy to chat though, DM me pal!\n\nAll the best! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What is your weight? 1500 seems low for an adult.\n\nOnce you develop a target joint it can be tough to manage as you know. Once the synovial lining of the joint becomes inflamed from bleeding and the body breaking down blood in the joint it becomes easier for repeated bleeding to happen because the blood vessels in the inflamed lining get pinched or just break open, it is a vicious cycle. \n\nIf you are having a lot of break through issues, you should talk to your Hemotologist about adjusting your dose up, or there are other things that are possible do like a radio synovectomy, which the TLDR is it basically kills back the synovial lining so it does not bleed as much into the joint, but that option comes after others have been exhausted.  Like everybody else said 1500 units sounds low. I weigh 150 lbs (68 kilos) and I am on 3400 units 3 times a week with Eloctate, the 48 hour extended half life. \n\nI am mid 30s, severe hemophilia A and I have had multiple problems even doing prophylaxis since I was 9. Listen to everyone else when they say you cannot undo the damage that is been done, but with precautions you can minimize damage for your future. I was much the same before, only treated as needed. I have been on Recombinant since I was born. In late 2016 I started getting a target joint bleed in my left elbow and eventually, after a year, had to go to prophylatic. After about 3 months we realized that Recombinant was not really doing its job so they switched me to the longer lasting Eloctate. \n\nKnock on wood, but so far so good. Have not had a bleed since November. Also went to physical therapy for my elbow which has helped out a ton. Going to be switching to Hemlibra when it becomes available though because my veins are just flat out done. They are so scarred and constantly blowing and I do not really want a port if Hemlibra is coming out soon (please pass it FDA!) Yeah I am at 195 lbs and am on 5,500 units of Eloctate per week. I was at 4,500 but they did some blood tests and decided to up it a bit more. Prophylaxsis should be keeping you at minimum always above 1%, preventing spontaneous bleeds. If you are still getting bleeds, you need your prescription adjusted. \n\n1500 IU every other day sounds really odd. Might want to get that checked. Man I love Eloctate, my quality of life has improved dramatically. I still get the occasional bleed in my target joints, but they are not nearly as bad as before, and heal quicker. On top of that I rarely get bleeds in non-target joints.\n\nPlus, infusing every 4 days is better than 3 times a week when I was on Advate.  My hematologist told me I could lower to twice a week on Eloctate, but I found I was getting more bleeds during the gaps between treatments. Other than that I am really happy with it. Ahhh, everyone is different, I have talked to many ppl with Hemophilia at our events, what works for some doesnt always work as well for others. I do hate the packaging for Eloctate though. I dont know who designed it, but they suck. I know they are aware of it, but I guess changing packaging requires a crap ton of approval by regulations so I doubt it will ever change.\n Wow! I feel so happy to go through all of your replies. Means a lot for someone like me who has spent most of his life being alone, stuck in his own bubble.\n\nAs to answer for one of the common question, I stand close to 145 lbs (66 kilos) in weight. I started off by injecting 2000 IU of Recombinant NovoEight twice every week after my doctor ran some pharmacokinetics analysis on me. He did mention that the rise in factor was sufficiently fine with 2000 IU but my body does not retain the level for a long time. Sadly, this regime did not work fine enough for me as I would still bleed spontaneously by the second day and so I switched to injecting 1000 IU every other day. It did work fairly well, but again it might also be because I was way too overprotective about myself during that period. Over the time I decided to pump up my activities a bit and along with it my dose to 1500 IU. That is where things went terribly wrong. Not sure if it just was an unlucky month but I had like 4 bleeds in all different joints the moment I started off with it. As suggested by my doctor, I am now looking forward to infusing 1000 IU every day to see how good it works - I know it is a pain but at the moment I will do anything to go a month without a bleed :( 145.0 lbs \u2248 65.8 kilograms ^(1 pound = 0.45kg)\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot.

It is been 15 years now ever since I started having issues with my knee and there was little I could do about it. Running was something which was totally out of the question and so was working out. All I could ever do was to lay in my bed like a good kid. The last 23 years of my life has been nothing more than a horror story and I feel a bit broken knowing that prophylaxis is not going to change much of it. Oh Hey Scott, I have been following your page for quite a while now ever since your girlfriend posted about it here, maybe? I would really like to mention that it is a great initiative that you have taken up to spread awareness about our kind. Back in my school days, everyone used to think of me as a drama king of some kind for I would barely come to school or participate in any of the activities. They would bully me, call me names and what not. If only they understood about my problem and the things I was going through, would I be a little less emotionally scarred today. I know the feeling pal. People used to think of me as delicate and I suppose I reacted maybe a little bit differently to you. I always felt the need to prove that I was not, I would get into fights more often than not and actually put myself in more danger than anything. I still get it at work today when they do not understand how I need to take time off because of a bleed and I cannot walk but I can walk in the next day and appear to be absolutely fine!

But is haemo\u2019s need to stick together so anything I can do to help please let me know! Well, I am 145 lbs (66 kilos) at the moment =/ \n\nI have been told that I have developed a pretty bad case of synovitis in my knee because of which it always remains swollen even when I am having no bleed. I am a bit scared to get it checked out to be honest. A part of me knows that it is not a good news awaiting for me at the other side of the road. But heck, I need to gather up my courage and get it done. Radio synovectomy is what I am heading towards as well, is what I believe. Man it will definitely improve you life I have no doubt about that. Im from Canada so I have had the opportunity to try out different factors. Pm me  Depends on when you STARTED prophy.  If you start at 1 or so, your time weight bearing was not very long and your joints are better.  If you waited till you had a target joint or other serious bleeds, then the microbleeds in the other joints did damage that now as a teen or adult is catching you.  The joint surfaces are smooth and slippery by nature.  When you bleed, you put iron, platelet derived growth factor, and neutrophils into the joint and you create rough spots in the surface.  These rough spots act like a ding in the blade of a block plane.  They cut into the other surface and the osteoarthritic process starts up.  \n\nIt also depends on how much prophy you got.  I start at 1 year and I give my patients QOD factor with trough levels of 3-5% because I want the average level to be in the 15-20% range.  This means that for most of the time, their levels are at or above the levels that are associated with any joint bleeding (other than macrotrauma).  This means more factor and usually a port, but it keeps those toddler joints clean.  Other centers used once a week prophy which bypasses a port for most boys.  This means that for 5 of the 7 days, you are not above 1%.  More bleeding potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B; Not a doctor, but *please* consider switching to an extended half-life (EHL) product. It will help. Best decision I have so far made in my internally-bleeding life. It was the first year of my life I went virtually bleed-free, although I did have some *minor* ones due to me failing to do prophylaxis on time.\n\nI would suggest to do some googling\u2014the two main kinds of EHL products right now are using either Fc fusion or PEGylation to make it last longer. PEGylation seemed scary to me, so I did not try it. Fc fusion just has an extra arm on the Factor protein that makes it bond to your antibodies to recirculate longer, basically (again, not a doctor).\n\nEloctate\u2019s what I have been on and I have had no issues.

If he has factor 9, he could be developing an anaphylactic inhibitor to factor 9.  He would need to see the HTC pretty soon for that.

Keep track of when he gets them and what is going on that day.  What did he eat? What did he wear? Where did he sleep? Where did he go/is going to?

Developing an anaphylactic inhibitor would mean he would break out in hives after getting infused, right? His hives do not seem to correlate with administration of an infusion.  That is good.  I would see his PCP and deal with the hives.  There are a lot of potential causes and the sooner this gets sorted, the sooner you do not have this hanging over him and you. I became allergic to factor 9 and can no longer take it. The hives closed up my throat so like others have said I would look into correlation with the medicine he is receiving and bring it up to his doctors as it can get serious. For me it happened instantly, midinfusion but everyone is different.\n\nI have never had hives otherwise and since it seems to not correlate with infusions from what you said you other comments perhaps it is something around the house? He may be spending more time in bed when his joints are hurting, so perhaps he could be allergic to something on his pillows/sheets. How do you treat a bleed if you are allergic to Factor IX? I use Novo 7 for lesser bleeds which is pretty hit or miss and Novo 7 + Prednisone for worse ones which is very effective but not something you really want to take too often. Wow.  Do you have an allergic reaction to both plasma-derived and recombinant factor products? It is been close to 10 years since I became allergic so I could not tell you for sure. It is unlikely I would want to mess with any factor 9 product again though, it was pretty scary. Hives are a tricky thing to diagnosis, the trigger could be anywhere. \n\nHas he gone to an allergist and had the scratch testing performed for example?\n\nReason I ask is some recombinant products are made using Chinese hamster ovary(CHO) cells and there can be some vestigial mouse DNA present. Those products usually say in the product insert do not take if your allergic to mice/hamsters. \n\nJust food for though if you are thinking the factor is the culprit. Never had hives, but on a prior product I always had a mild metallic taste in my throat after injecting. I figured it was a mild allergy but never had it confirmed. This.  He should be tested for allergies to the excipients/stabilizers/cell mediums for his specific factor product. I only have gotten hives one time in my life, that I am aware of.  \n\nIn the late 80's I was in DC and got a very severe knee bleed.   We were forced to go to a hospital and get some cryo.   Dunno what it was, but that did it.  It was unbelievable itching.   I could only chalk it up to someone is blood which my body absolutely hated.   \n\nYou kids who never had to deal with hospitals and cryo for bleeds have no idea how fortunate you are.

Pretty painful. \nNo other side effects tho. I slept A LOT after my second dose. Yeah my shoulder was pretty painful. Felt like someone slugged me in it. Glad you got your shot though. I mean, they slam a needle into your muscle... it is going to hurt!   I felt a little tired after it, but I think it is possible that I was exposed to someone with covid about 3 days after my first shot.  Felt like misery and company.   Second shot did not do anything - maybe a little tired.   Nothing to be afraid of.  Lots of horror stories out there, but I hope it is just a bunch of FUD.\n\nSide note - I kind of feel hemlibra has weird effects on muscle bleeds, but may just be me. The pain is not from bleeding or bruising. Most people get it. It is a reaction from what is in the shot, not from the needle tho. It should go away after a day or two by itself. I had the same issue after getting it. It went away after a day or two. No issues. \n\nI did carry an ice pack with me when I went to get the vaccine and iced my arm for about 10-15 minutes at my HTC's suggestion. I typically do this for any  vaccine's that I get. Also try to get them on my infusion day since I am on prophy. I may be a bit over cautious, but I have not had any issues doing it that way.

I cannot count how many times I have been asked that one too! Makes me want to slap a fool lol but I digress. Best we can do is offer our knowledge to those whom are curious Absolutely! that hemophilia is caused by inbreeding. I was teased for a majority of my childhood by kids who never understood basic genetics. Recently I watched a video which was about royal inbreeding and they never clarified that... A it does not make you a descendent of the crown and B that Haemophila is a genetic mutation... NOT cause by inbreeding... it was sad to see the comments I will second that, people think you will be spraying blood like a firehose... when its actually life debilitating joint bleeds. Right tho \"Have you outgrow hemophilia already?\"\n\nAll my dad's family, including him, and even some not related people\nAnd then they call me negative because I tell them that I will not.\nNo like I am the one who wished the most that I would get randomly cured from hemophilia but that just will not happen. I am sorry to hear that, especially when family do not take the time to understand Haemophila and how it does and will affect you. I was in the hospital for something (you lose track after a while) and about 3 days into my stay I asked for a shaving kit.  I understand the lack of knowledge around our condition and being cautious but my request went from an orderly to a nurse to the floor doctor who called my hematologist before they brought me a razor.  Ignorance aside, if an adult asks for a razor, it is safe to assume they know how to use it safely.  Being bumped to the head of the line in the ER is nice but ignorance comes with a downside.  The more frustrating part is trying to explain how worn out joints are the bigger problem associated with a blood clotting disorder.  TBH, most people in my life have no idea I have hemophilia.  In elementary school, I learned that people make assumptions and ask ridiculous questions so when I changed schools around 6th grade I just kept it to myself and have kept it quiet ever since. Aside from my family, nobody in my everyday life has any idea so I get to avoid the nonsense. That is really interesting, it is so annoying to hear it was such a hassle to get a razor to shave!

The Drs had done all the test necessary to diagnose her, and then proceeded to not give her the diagnosis, because she is a woman. As a medical student (I study abroad, so that was tricky) during my hematology module I asked her to send me her test results and took her bleeding history and talked to a hematologist, and finally we were both relieved to know what she has is really hemophilia A... I have been told by one of my friend\u2019s mom that I could not come inside because she was afraid she would be liable if I bled out in their house somehow.\n\nI was 5. OMG that is insane!

I just cannot cope with all this while trying to make it work in my college. No idea what it was, but I had the very similar issue. Since I was a kid, my knees were wrecked.

Your dominant eye will be the one you see the item through the circle when the other eye is closed.\n\nIf you are left eye dominant (and more people are than are left handed), you will find that a left handed bow will be very comfortable.\n\nRifle shooting may also be good for you as these competitions are often in .22lr caliber with limited recoil and the rifles are commonly built for right handed shooters and are easy to shoot, even with disability.\n\nCheck the paralympic shooting websites for advice. Did that, I am right eye dominant.\nSo That means I would be holding it in my left hand. As I told, My left elbow did have a repeated bleeds in the past and has become weak. So I am afraid continuous practice would cause a problem for me.\n\nWhat do you think about fencing? I have not fenced since college.  I am a hemophilia treater and do not have any patients who have tried it.  I think that competitive level fencing would be hard on your knees and ankles.  The foil weighs very little.  The Epee' and the Sabre weigh more.  Both require more elbow motion.  If this is a problem, then I would either stay with the foil or think of an alternate sport.\n\n My right elbow is fine though. I see only one elbow is used. So I do not think that would cause much problem. Then give it try.  Have you looked at the \"Playing It Safe\" reference from NHF?  That might be helpful in getting ready for fencing as well as other sports suggestions.  Also, I might contact the paralympics as  a source of info in training and in what competitions you would be able to participate in if regular matches do not work out due to the hemophilia. Swimming  I forgot to tell you I am from a developing county which does not even recognize hemophilia in physically disabled category. Thanks for your time and information though. :) I am reading that reference,  and it is really helpful! Thanks again! :D Sports are good but music if forever. In high school I tried out for the track team. Running was good until my ankles gave out. Ankle bleeds suck. Turned to music and never looked back. Guitar. Bass guitar, and saxophone were my choices. Good luck with whatever you choose. Good luck! It is not quite a sport, but take up partner dancing.\n\nIt is low impact, good for your fitness, and it is a great way of meeting people and making friends.\n\nIf you like competing, there are dance competitions. (I do not take part in those, because it ruins the pleasure, but other people have the opposite view!) Because my left elbow has become weak. It gets annoying when I practise guitar  for too long! :(\n I guess it depends on the type of dancing as well.  Squash or racquetball were my sports in college after I tore my iliopsoas and did not want to expose myself to that danger again. It only requires one arm, is great for cardio and in general was not bad for my joints. I wore an ankle brace but never had any issues with it. Severe A.  Im a cyclist and race competitively.  The benefits really outweigh the risks.  Other than the occasional road rash here and there (luckily nothing serious), its a great sport for your joints once you get a proper bike fitting.\n\nEven if you do not race its a great hobby and lets you explore the world in ways you cannot do with other sports.

Hi there,\n\nHope you are doing fine and keeping yourself healthy.\n\nI have been using Emicizumab for almost 3 years now (I was on the introductory protocol in my country).\n\nI started with a weekly dose, but since December, they changed my to a dose every month. The situation now is that because of political/administrative problems, I have a delay of 2 weeks of my treatment.\n\nI received my last dose on December 8th, and the next was supposed to be on January 5th, however I will receive it on January 19th.\n\nAccording to the approved documents of how to handle Emicizumab on my country, after receiving the dose on January 19th I should receive my next monthly dose on February 5th, in order to keep high the levels of Emicizumab on my blood. \n\nDoes anyone has experience on this? In the last 3 years I had only have a bleed, but I am actively doing sports and exercise , so my fear is to have a lower level of the molecule on my body and being less protected. Hey,\n\nI am doing hemlibra weekly for 3 years already and missed once, because my hemotologist failed to prescribe(long story). So skipped one week, but everything was okay. Would suggest contacting your hemotologist, NMO, WFH, EHC if in EU or your regions equivalent. Whoever you trust most, since in my case it would be NMO, which would give me some info and people to contact. Do you still have FVIII for break through bleeds? Just in case? \nYou should probably talk to your HTC in case you need to have more frequent injections for a couple of weeks to get your levels back up? Thanks! The treatment is quite new here, some most of the hematologist do not have enough experience.\n\nBut I will check with my NMO. No. I have inhibitors, and as both bypass agents are high cost I believe I also have to go to the hospital to receive them. It has been a while since the last time a receive a dose of those.\n\nFortunately is usually do not  bleed a lot. My concern is more related to understand how to correctly return to the treatment. Example, January 19th will be my next dose. Considering a monthly dose, should next occur on February 16th, or on February 2th which was my original date?\n\n According to documentation it should be February 2th, but I wanted to know if someone already experience this, like Neziani. However in his case, we were talking about a weekly regime. Yeah. Which is why I wondered if you would need a mini load because on the monthly dose you still start with weekly to get your levels up. If you do not have a dose for 6 weeks you may drop too far. Yes. Exactly. Today on week 6 after the dose, I do not feel as well as I did before. Some ache has return to my knee and ankle and I do not feel as confident as before going back to exercise.\n\nIt might be a lack of confidence. But it might not. It is harder to tell with a treatment like Emicizumab, because it looks like it stay on the blood a lot of time. On himlibra for three years. Took dose weekly for 1st two years. Now taking in two weeks. I missed dose on time my doctor said to me if I take dose 2 days before or 2 days after my scheduled day it is not a problem. And weekly dose is Roche's Preferred method. According to my doctor himlibra half life period is 1 month.\nAnd by the way which country are you from? The FDA approved package labeling in the US states that the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, then the usual dosing schedule should be resumed. \n\nAs someone else mentioned, the elimination half-life is approximately 30 days, and a general rule of thumb is that the drug will be completely eliminated from the body by five half-lives. That does not necessarily mean you will have enough drug in the body to actually have a therapeutic effect for that length of time, but in this case, I think chances are good that someone in your situation will be OK. I am from Mexico! I receive the monthly dose today.\n\nAccording to the package labeling here at Mexico it should be the same, \"take the dose as soon as possible, then the usual dosing schedule\".\n\nHowever it looks that because of administrative situation, I am not going to \"resume\" the previous schedule, but instead I will simply receive the new dose in a month.\n\nHope it works :)", "FDA Approves Octapharma\u2019s WILATE for Hemophilia A in Adult and Adolescent Patients ", "The Hellscape of Hematologists Hello,\n\nVon Willebrand Type 1 (or Type 2A... I have actually never been told...) here. (TMI incoming) I have been on my period since July, with breakthrough bleeding even though I am on oral birth control. Since then, I have been in this hellscape of attempting to get my Stimate refilled and getting doctors to care. First, I was with a doctor assigned to me by my insurance at the time. His response was word-for-word, \"Meh. No one has ever died from their period,\" while drawing lots of blood for tests and having the audacity to call me later that week with the stunning test result that my hemoglobin levels were low.\n\nI got better insurance and saw a better doctor eventually. She took a lot of pity but said she does not feel comfortable prescribing Stimate to a new patient. She referred me to a hematologist down the road. I called the hematologist just now and was given a big attitude because I am QQing over my 9 month long period instead of the more important and actually life-threatening cases they see. I was grilled on my Stimate dosage and on why I have not been seeing a hematologist regularly. I answered that I had not really had von Willebrand symptoms for several years, so having a constant refill of very expensive medication did not seem wise, and when I did need it, my PCP at the time (two doctors ago ) prescribed it to me.\n\nIt was also just now demanded I get my medical records from the hematologist who diagnosed me, and I was told I need to make sure that the records indicate how much Stimate I was prescribed. I was being treated like I was asking for a morphine refill, not for medication that helps with blood clotting and (for other people) bedwetting. \n\nBasically, since my new doctor received my medical records, I am going to see if she can forward them, but crap. This is obnoxious. Anyone else go through similar crap with hematology/oncology offices? I feel like every one I call gives me an attitude for having the audacity to establish a relationship with a hematologist for the lifelong, incurable bleeding disorder I have. \n\nIt might be faster to just get a hysterectomy at this point... I am a hemophiliac who went to college in a big city with a university hospital and had the best hematologist I could have hoped for. Once I moved for a job I realized how lucky I was to have him. Since then I have seen four hematologists in five years before finally deciding it was worth driving farther to go to another teaching hospital (I also had a near-death experience that made the change necessary).\n\nIt is hard to find a hematologist who actually focuses on bleeding disorders. The others think they know more than they do, to our detriment, or completely defer to us on all decisions, also to our detriment.\n\nYou have the added complexity of being a woman, unfortunately. I wish it were not true but I know from my sister's experiences with hematologists that they just do not take women as seriously as men. My sister has had test after test to \"figure out\" why she is FVIII deficient even when they know her brother is (they do not even believe the outdated notion of \"symptomatic carrier\" that the NHF has been fighting lately). If she did not live across the country with me I would offer to go with her. They have no treatment plan for her despite her issues bleeding throughout her life. Her levels are enough that stimate would definitely help but they are not even willing to try - even though it is been tried on me numerous times to always find out it is not helpful enough for me. \n\nDepending on where you live, you may be able to find an advocacy group for vWD or hemophilia that can help. You can ask for recommendations on doctors from women who have had to do the same work. If that is not available, in my experiences the nearest teaching or university hospital may have the best option.\n\nSorry you are going through this! Honestly it is so \"easy\" for me to get desmopressin even though I have no use for it that I am shocked. It took me literally gushing blood onto the exam table to get my OB to take my bleeding issues seriously.  Luckily my hematologist is awesome but it took years to find him.  I was told by the wonderful pediatric hematologist I saw after my first bleed that no one will take \"unspecified bleeding disorder\" seriously until they see me bleed, and it is up to me to learn both what I need and how to advocate for myself.\n\nI have had good luck with Jolessa for staunching heavy period bleeds, and you may be able to get that more easily than the DDAVP.  Good luck! To piggyback: \nLook up the nearest HTC (Hemophilia treatment center) in your area. Get in to see a hematologist who specializes in bleeding disorders as soon as you can. It took us a couple months to get an appointment, but the support staff has been helpful in setting up ongoing care.  Thanks guys. Luckily, being near a major city with a major medschool means I may have a good chance at seeing a hematologist there. I am going to check them out and see what my chances are. I appreciate the idea. I had tried calling this same hematology/oncology clinic before I had my current insurance, offering to pay out of pocket. They copped an attitude with me there as well, since I did not have a referral. I have been thinking of skipping the middleman and going for an IUD, but I have been wanting to get a hematologist's blessing prior. I also have a friend who is a primary care physician. I am going to ask him if he has any hematologists he prefers and works with. Ooh I need to research that. Also, your username is the best. I also did not know that HTCs were a thing. I think we were on our third hematologist/oncologist before finding some resources on the ( \n\nIt can be really tough being asymptomatic for a long stretch and then getting reminded in a big way. I hope you can get a treatment plan worked out, perhaps one that is flexible enough if you are planning to move again soon.  I totally understand how you feel. From all my hematologists I have had, they all seem stuck in a grouping mentality. I have more bleeds than the average hemophiliac, and they tend to be more severe, however I am treated like the majority of hemophiliacs. Which ends up with me not getting the care and attention I need and suffer more. It is calming more people have experienced this and it is not me just being narcissistic. It seems the only way to get stuff done is to yell and fight, which should not be the case at all. I cannot stand manage healthcare, they do not do anything till shit hits the fan and you end up suffering because of it. You can use ( to look up your closest HTC.\n\nKeep in mind that, same as hematologists, all HTCs are not created equal.  However, you will hopefully find that they have more experience treating bleeding disorders like vWD.  Good ones will have a solid treatment protocol in place, in addition to compassion for your patient experience. If you are near Indiana, I skimmed your post, I highly recommend the IHTC. They are amazing. Once a year even they do free clinics, where you can see thier dental hygienists, physical therapists, career councilors, insurance councilors, mental health all for free. They even run their own pharmacy and all the proceeds go to help the patients. They even give gas cards to help patients who drive from far away. I guess as an update, I had a gynecologist recommended by a friend last month. I called her office and they told me that it would be 1-2 months before I could see her. I was so frustrated that my voice began cracking and I begged for something sooner, explaining my situation. They put me on hold for a few moments and said they could squeeze me in for May 9th, which was only a two week wait instead of a potentially 2 month wait. \n\nI just saw her this last Tuesday, and she is getting me fit in for an IUD next week or the week after (likely the week after since I have a training class all week that spans the entire time the clinic is open). What is better, this gynecologist knew all about von Willebrand and the clinic specializes in irregular bleeding. She asked so many of the right questions and when speaking about the upcoming procedure, she asked, \"So I know you cannot have aspirin, but are you on any other medication restrictions so I can order you what you need?\" My heart went aflutter.\n\nShe asked if I was established with a hematologist and if I had my DDAVP spray, and as I was describing my frustrations with both, she was cracking a smile. I asked why she was smiling. She told me that her husband is a hematologist. She said she knows that hematologists can be so hard to get a hold of, and her husband is not officially accepting new patients, but she gave me his card and told me that she will have him call me to squeeze me in, after asking for my permission to do so, but also encouraged me to call his practice if a few days go by without hearing from him.\n\nSo! Even though my pharmacist is not letting me refill my oral birth control to help with my bleeding (and obviously the not-getting-pregnant bit), citing that it is \"too soon\" for me to order more for another three weeks and I am about to run out tomorrow, I am in higher spirits knowing that this saga is coming to a close.\n\nThanks for all the advice, everyone. I was in the process of researching HTCs around my area (Georgia) and found one a few hours away that my husband and I were considering going to. We were also considering simply going to the ER to get a Stimate drip. All while trying so desperately to fill out the mountains of paperwork my diagnosing hospital requires for me to request records. I am glad that this option also opened up for me, even though I am trying to not be cynical in assuming that I will probably never be called and will fight frustrations trying to be seen by her husband's practice. This post is old and you may have solved it already.  In case you still need help, a couple of options.\n\n1.  The CDC has a well done website for von Willebrands disease and links to the federally funded HTCs.  (\n\n2.  The National Hemophilia Foundation's website also has this link (hemophilia.org)\n\n3.  The Foundation for Women and Girls with Blood Disorders is really interested in VWD.\n\n4.  If you live in a city with a medical school, the OBGYNs are pretty keyed up on VWD as menorrhagia is both a common problem in diagnosed women and  common presentation for women who have yet to have a formal diagnosis.  Give them a call.", "Advice for Parents? Hi guys, I have a kid with hemophilia A, I infuse him 2-3 times a week. He is three and starting to understand what hemophilia is and why he gets infused. He likes to play doctor and \"infuse\" the cat and teddy bears and stuff. I feel like he has a really healthy relationship with hemophilia so far. He lays down for his infusion and keeps his hand on his belly button while I explain what I am doing. Outside of infusions I do not really talk about hemophilia.  I guess my question is, how do I normalize hemophilia? What are things your parents did that made you feel empowered about your bleeding disorder? What is something you found terrible or embarrassing that I can hopefully avoid? Any advice or insight on what it is like to live with hemophilia is appreciated. 42 year old severe hemophiliac and also a father here!\n\nHemophilia today can be easily managed and integrated into any normal lifestyle. This year would have marked my 29th year at hemophilia summer camp, but it was cancelled due to Covid 19. Over my lifetime I have seen huge changes in hemophilia treatment and outcomes. When I was a young child, virtually all of the severe hemophiliacs like myself were handicapped, disfigured, and crippled from the disease. Now as a camp counselor I am seeing an entire camp of kids who are mostly free of physical impairments. The future is bright for people with hemophilia, and with the advancements in gene therapy, this disease is headed for the history books soon I hope. \n\nI would say the most valuable lesson my parents learned about how to raise me with hemophilia is that the disease provides a great platform for teaching young children the importance of responsibility in managing their own health and well being. At a very young age it became very easy for me to understand that the quality of my life was much, much better if I simply took the time to cooperate with my twice a week factor infusions. My pain level was much lower and my ability to do the fun stuff I wanted to do was greatly improved when I cooperated. I think if you can make that connection with your child they could incorporate that valuable lesson into other parts of their life and you could quite possibly produce a young adult with a better grasp of the value of planning ahead for their own medical needs as well as other important considerations besides just their medical stuff. My parents were very good at making the connection that my ability to learn about and manage my own health care needs would open up lots of extra opportunities for fun and excitement. Learning to infuse myself at a young age was very empowering. It allowed me to take trips and go to activities with friends and family that were simply not possible for someone who could not manage their own infusion needs. \n\nThere is really not much I can think of that was \"terrible or embarrasing\" with hemophilia. I think when I finally started dating it was a slightly weird experience explaining my disease to some girl I had a crush on, but outside of that I do not think there is much for you to worry about. \n\nHemophilia is a scary thing for new parents with no background or family experience with the disease. You can turn a scary experience into an empowering and valuable teaching tool with the right approach. Show your child that they can follow their dreams and do more than anyone thinks they are capable of if they take the time to make good choices about their healthcare needs. You will be surprised at what they can achieve! It sounds like you are doing great so far! That sort of play is amazing for your kid at this age and how he plays can reveal a lot about how he is feeling that he may not be able to express. For example, is the teddy bear/cat \"scared\" when he does it? Does he (as the infuser) reassure them and comfort them? And your description of how infusions go also sounds great - as someone who is hopefully going to finish an RN program soon I can say that is how nurses today are told to provide care for children: try and provide a calm environment, involve them as much as possible, explain each thing you are doing and be honest about what they might feel (do not say \"it should not hurt\" for example when whatever is about to happen will cause discomfort, for example).\n\nLike u/gabrielleigh I also attended camp as a kid and have been going back as a counselor. This would have been my 15th year back since 1996, but they (rightfully) cancelled due to the pandemic. The camp I go to is great. When I went in the 90s it was a little more somber because like gabriel said, many hemophiliacs at the time needed crutches, chairs, maybe had HCV or HIV from previous treatment regimens. Now when I go I am shocked at how many of the adolescents are able to play in high school sports with no issues, and they are in control of their hemophilia in ways I never thought possible when I was their age. The camps are great at teaching kids to self-infuse, too, which I think is a really valuable skill to learn when young.\n\nAs for how normal it is, your kid probably will not notice anything until school starts. It sounds like he is really acclimated to what is normal for him so far. Once school hits he may have to answer a lot of questions from other kids - it may be worth talking to other parents of kids with bleeding disorders who have gone through this already to see what kind of questions are common and if there are answers you can provide your son for dealing with them. In elementary school a lot of times someone would ask me, I would answer and they would just kind of be like \"oh okay\" and we would keep going on because that is how that age group is. Once you hit like 15 years old I bet a lot of our experiences diverge, though. It was never really a problem for me to deal with. 26 year old male, Severe A. \n\nI dont have kids so my perspective may be a little different. I believe a parent with a hemo child should \"normalize\" their child with Hemophilia. Teach your child that it is not a taboo or weird thing that makes them incapable of thing \"normal\" kids can do. As long as your kid grows up knowing he can do the same things as everyone else with a little more caution, I think you are on the right track. Educate him on the importance of being treated just the same way he brushes his teeth in the morning. If he learns that infusion is normal, hemiphilia is normal then he can be a normal kid. \n\nMy parents did not do much to help \"normalize\" my diagnosis. My mother would treat me when I had bleeds and would allow me to be a kid but we never had constructive discussions. It was always me trying to play football, or baseball or lift weights thT would bring hemophilia into the conversation.\n\nThe thing I did to \"normalize\" my Hemophilia was attend a camp for bleeders. Your son is a few years too young but that could be an option when he is closer to 8 y/o. We became members of our local Hemophilia chapter and they pointed us is a direction of the summer camp program. The best thing was seeing HUNDREDS of kids with Von Willebrands and Hemophilia- a bunch of normal kids at a summer camp. I attended that camp every summer from age 8 to age 16. That is where it became the most \"normal\" to me and I learned how to self-infuse my second year at age 9. I will always recommend that program to parents.\n\nEdit: Get involved with your local Hemophilia chapter of you have one (and if you havent all ready). My nephew has server hemo B. We let him practice sticking all of us (uncle, 2 grandparents, and both parents). We do not talk to him about what he cannot do because of hemophilia, we talk to him about what we have to do to prep to be safe. He is 9 now, he can infuse himself and depending on how he feels is if he does it him self; his parents wanted to make sure he can save himself if something happens. Be apart of a local group, and try not to build a stigma around it.  Everything is extra scary and it sucks, but we feel living in constant fear is no way to live; so I would encourage you to teach your child how to infuse on their own as soon as you can so they have power over their illness. \n\nMy mother runs an advocacy group and knows all kids of different organizations all over the us. If you would like I can share her Facebook info in a private message. I was always told I was just like anybody else and I can do anything anybody else could do. I was told to be careful in case I got a bleed but other than that try to be really active. And to always infuse as quickly as possible when I did get hurt. My mom has a brother with him severe hemophilia A who is a bush pilot in Alaska and has been since he was 15. He is 72 now and still flies he is had both knees replaced and both hips  replaced but he lived the first 30 years of his life without factor. So if he can do that kids of our generation should be just fine. With good treatment and hopefully without any inhibitors that is. I was never embarrassed about anything having to do with hemophilia. 18 year old here with Hemophilia A - severe\n\nFor later years:\n\nMy biggest struggle has always been feeling like I can do what others can do. As soon as he is a reasonable age to do so, teach him to infuse himself so he has a good habit and does not skip out and cause permanent damage like I did. Get him into swimming! I have been a swimmer all my life and I am confident in the water because it lets me have full mobility and makes me feel much healthier than my joints really are! Do NOT let him get too heavy or fat. My brother and I have been to that place and I can tell you it destroyed our joints. Him his knees and me my ankles. If you can, connect him with someone else who has hemophilia, make him feel like he has someone else outside the family who he can relate, it helps feel less alienated from others. Keep on eye on making sure he is social if he wants to be. I am not hugely social myself but I know that there were a lot of times when I simply could not because of injury. Work around it, find creative solutions that both let him socialize and, if possible, without anything additional. Making special rules just for him is going to make him feel extremely different. Get him into hobbies like reading early, he will learn to love it and it will make a lot of things simpler if he is not running around hurting himself all the time. Lastly, keep him relatively fit, he needs to keep some muscle to prevent him from relying on his joints and hurting them. Really, the last one is important, I relied on my joints for years and got severe arthritis. I had surgery that helps but it still hurts like hell sometimes. I am only 18. STEPS for LIVING on the hemophilia.org site is good.\nHe is too young to infuse himself, but sounds advanced enough to start setting up the gear with you or helping to push in the plunger on the syringe.\n\nI try to get my parents to start transition to adult care around 4 years of age.  By breaking it down over the next 14 years, the stuff can be small steps instead of big ones.  I also try to get kids into normal activities (right now, he is too little for Tball or other sports, but kicking a soccer ball with kids might be something he would like.)  By doing this, later on, you can help him rationalize that the factor is letting him be normal.  By taking it on time and by rapid reaction to injuries, he gets to stay in the game more.  \n\nSounds like you are doing great right now.  Let him help set up or clean up after the sharps are gone, or maybe help push the plunger once in a while. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 Good bot Thank you for sharing your perspective. I am so, so grateful for the medical advances that make hemophilia easy to control. Our doctor mentioned that he began working in Hemophilia in the 80's, and lost many of his pediatric patients to HIV/AIDS. Now, he feels confident he will see a cure before his retirement. Again, incredibly grateful for medical science and all of the resources available to my family. This week we had his annual comprehensive visit and are considering switching to Hemlibra, which could be a real game changer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take your words to heart and really appreciate you sharing this advise.  I never want my son to feel like he cannot accomplish something based on his disorder. As he  gets older I feel the pressure to make sure he is empowered and confident, not just with hemophilia treatment but in all aspects of life. Thanks again I appreciate the perspective of someone without children, definitely.  You mentioned your mom would treat your bleeds. A couple times when my son has been injured I quickly remarked \"Let us do an infusion!\" or something along those lines. I worried that would make him want to hide pain from me. injury=infusion. I stopped saying that and just take a mental note  of falls, and infuse later. If there anything that made you feel like infusions provide comfort? Anything your mom did/does that helped when you had bleeds? Do you wish you had more \"constructive discussions\" or were you pretty accepting/aware of your diagnosis?  I guess I have a fear that he will have a bleed and not tell me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am glad to hear that you enjoyed camps!! I have read about them and they look fun, but have heard mixed things about them. I think eight is a great age to start that kind of thing. Thank you so much for your response. I was pretty aware, not so accepting and completely against letting other people know I have it until I went to that camp program. My mom raised 3 boys, and I am the only bleeder so I usually felt alone. Like really alone. Constructive discussions would have been nice, but I dont think it would have taken root. Having a treatment center helped tho. We had little events where the staff would teach us what was going on with our bleeding disorders.\n\nHe might become accustomed to hiding pain, but as long as you positively reinforce the importance of treating preventatively or treating a bleed he will get used to it like brushing his teeth. He is still very young and it might take a few years of growth to see how he handles his bleeding disorder. \n\nAs Mom, its most important for you to infuse at the time of an injury. If he sees that you infuse later, he will learn that. What you want him to learn is injuries need to be taken care of as soon as possible because the sooner he is treated, the sooner he can go back to having fun. \n\nI was an EMT and the staff at my treatment center gave me tips for working with kids. One of the best was play a game, maybe the freeze game when he needs an infusion. Before you stick him, ask him to show you how long he can \"freeze\", or keep himself still. \n\nThe best resource for a parent, in my opinion, is a good HTC and being involved with a local Hemophilia chapter.

I would love a Hemo friend to go to foundation events with once the world goes back to normal. Welcome! Welcome! Former Californian but still a hemo! Hit me up if you want :) I m also severe hemo, but now relocated to Bangalore,  India. Welcome buddy I have question, You can chose not to answer. I was in USA for brief period for my work. I got the post doctoral fellow in UCLA, USC, but my health was deteriorating with many back to back swelling episodes. At least in India, I have my family to take care off me during some tough times. So, I did not take that offer,\n\nalso had two major worries.\n\n1. Insurance, i am not sure what will be copay-deductible, premium for person with server hemophilia condition in California insurance market. (I am literally scared of USA health system cost, I stocked so much medicine before entering USA)\n2. Lack of low cost transport during internal bleeding episodes. I am scared of taking emergency vehicle, Uber cost a lot for long distance that will financially bankrupt me, may reach more than my post doc stipend.\n\nAs a native Californian and severe hemo could you shed some light on this What is your trick for successfully setting the needle? I totally get your concerns. \n\nBut you were offered a post doc, that is a job so the university should provide you with the details of their employee health insurance. Did you ask?\n\nUsually academic institutions have decent cover &amp; that most times covers emergency transport - but you also might be allowed prophy cover so reduce your bleeds overall. Yes, Universities offering PSBP plan for post doc. But the copay is very high for hospitalization there is also deductibles. 20-40% copay with more than 250 deductible.  Since, I will be spending more money on transport (without car)+ co-pay will bankrupt me. Heard, lot of stories of my friends who had bad time in their university insurance, like  out of network for emergency, like devil is in the detail kind of thing. I am not sure, What is the avg in hand expenditure for severe hemo with disability  in the traditional University insurance plan. I hope you understand my financial concern. Welcome dude!

We hope there is somekind of way to do it safely, and with pleasure obviously. Any tips or recommandations for us? Or is it really too risky? \n\nThanks everyone! Just infuse before.  Maybe not go so hard. Slow and smooth. Also maybe use some lube. If he is on factor replacement therapy (prophylaxis) it should be fine, but do it after an infusion the same day. Tons of lube and take it slow. Should be no problem. infuse before, lube and do not go too fast, got it! Thanks everyone Trim your nails, file them, make it so you cannot scratch. More lube than you think is necessary. Would not say infusing *right before* is required as long as there is a bit of factor VIII still in his system. Just try not to rip his insides\u2014it is significantly thinner than external skin. I have a rare inherited bleeding disorder (RIHB), so it is not entirely the same, but the basic principles are hopefully pretty close. Other than infusing, these are the best tips I have come across. My family would be so proud right now...\n\nPlenty of Lube- a nice long lasting lube(eg: silicone or hybrid) will help reduce friction and decrease the risk of tearing\n\nNo Anal-ease: it is supposed to make everything feel better by numbing the area; however, I could not feel myself stretch too quickly the first time, and definitely bled. Personally, if you want something for the booty, I would go with Happy Hiney. \n\nMake sure he is relaxed- we all go to the bathroom, and expel things wider than a single finger, so a finger is unlikely to cause much damage if he is relaxed (as long as the nails are trimmed and filed). You can try a variety of techniques here- eat him out, play with him, give him a massage, whatever. The more tense he is, the more likely it is that insertion will cause a tear\n\nGraduation- if things go well, and you guys want to move on from a finger to, um, bigger things, he will need to slowly progress towards that goal. I guess what I am trying to say is buttplugs. Nice, squishy silicone has been very helpful for some people...\n\nClean Up-If you are drilling for oil, you are going to hit dirt. And it is significantly harder to see blood if it is mixed with other things. Once he is clean and ready to go, keep a cloth or towel handy. You will inevitably need to wipe up lube and various fluids while playing, and this is a good time to assess if there is any bleeding during the fun. I have heard a good test is to scrape the inside of your cheek with your finger tip. If you can feel your nail, it is too long.\nL Damn, where did you go? Anal college? I mean, it is taken me four years to figure out how to do this without bleeding like a stuck pig. I guess I am advancing to my PhD", "Do we get a lowered risk of Venous Thromboembolism? I am about to take medication that increases the chance for forming blood clots (venous thromboembolism), namely Cyproterone and Oestradiol. I wanted to know if Hemophilia would lessen this risk or does it remain the same? I would think that the amount of replacement factor therapy would play a large role. But a quick google shows me that factor activity levels do not actually affect your risk of clots as significantly as I would think or as much as other risk factors (all I could find was a study showing greater than 150% fviii activity correlated to a 5% increase in clots). I am not a doctor or pharmacist though and I really think this is something you should talk about with your hematologist or pharmacist. In the US every pharmacy retailer will have a licensed pharmacist on duty who will be happy (I hope!) to help you understand more about the risks and benefits. To be honest though, we definitely do not understand all of the coagulation cascade, so do not expect an absolute answer. I did not know that about US Pharmacies. Good thing to know since I just got to Guam so I am thousands of miles away from my hematologist.\n\nThank you for your input! From personal experience I would probably say no, back in 2001 I was unlucky enough to get a pulmonary embolism (clot in my lung) and I am a severe factor 8 with an inhibitor lol, that was a fun month in the hospital with a chest tube and the doctors scratching their heads on how to treat the clot without me dying :) Oh boy. Haha I guess I will have to take the necessary precautions to prevent thrombosis and embolism once I start taking my meds.\n\nOut of curiosity, what DID the doctors do?\n\nThank you so much for the info! And sorry to hear about your experience. I hope that never happens again \u2665 &gt; Haha I guess I will have to take the necessary precautions to prevent thrombosis and embolism once I start taking my meds.\n\nIt really should not be a particular problem, in my 40 years of life that one P.E. was the only \"over\" clotting incident I or my older brother have had. Though now with some of the newer meds available there are some additional risks if they are mixed, like the new Hemelibra drug, apparently if you are taking hemelibra and then take Fieba there is a high risk of unwanted thrombosis.\n\nIt was a similar reason that I developed my P.E., I was hospitalized for a knee bleed that was not responding to treatment very well and they switched back and forth a couple times between Fieba and NovoSeven along with being stuck in bed for about 10 days I slightly over clotted and then once I was able to get up and move around a piece of a clot, or a whole clot, broke free and made itself a home in my lower left lung.\n\n&gt; Out of curiosity, what DID the doctors do? \n\nAt first it was a lot of scratching their heads, they could not administer the normal drugs for breaking up clots in cases like this since it would risk doing much more harm than good, possibly even death. So they ended up administering a large amount of pain control, since it was very painful to take even a shallow breath, oddly enough they actually overdosed me and had to use narcan (or something similar) initially lol. Once they got the pain control dialed in and I could breath better they admitted me to observe and hope my body would heal itself. After a couple days and my left lung completely filling full of fluid and essentially collapsing they opted to put in a chest tube. The chest tube remained for about 3 weeks draining off fluid my body just naturally healed, and that was basically all I can recall them being able to do back then. In the end I lost about 20% of my left lung as it died and then turned into a wad of scar tissue, that still occasionally hurts when I take a really deep breath.\n\nThrough the whole thing I never remember being worried about anything bad happening or even dying, while everyone around me was freaking out for the first week or so. The only time I freaked a bit was when they said they were going to put in the chest tube and just use local anesthesia and I quickly told them hell no \"I have watch those things being put in on the discovery channel and local anesthesia is not going to cut it, I want to be out completely for it\" The docs were a bit taken aback but thankfully a conversation with my HTC nurses got it done with general anesthesia. Dealing with the pain and letting the body heal seems to be the last resort of most doctors dealing with us haha.. I almost died when a fistula formed in my guts. After everything else failed and I was basically dead, they took me off solid food for three months, only survived with high-nutrient milk and an IV drip.\n\nHaving nothing in my stomach allowed the hole to shut itself... Eventually.\n\nAnyway, thank you for the information! I can more comfortably take the meds I mentioned in relative peace.", "What is a bleed and what is soreness Am I the only one who feels confused by their own body?  Less of an academic question and more putting it out there, because sometimes I legitimately cannot tell when I am sore or when I am having a bleed.  Usually the bleeds make themselves apparent, but for a while it feels like a guessing game, and the stress of that seems enough to further trigger a bleed 41 year old professional hemophiliac here. \n\nNot sure how old your are, or what your overall physical condition is, but pain can come from many sources aside from \"textbook\" hemophilia bleeds. I suffer from a variety of painful problems that cannot be treated with infusions. Problems like arthritis and tendonitis can be very painful, yet they are not cured by normal factor infusions. \n\nI have been able to distinguish the difference in pain based on the location of my pain. This is not foolproof, of course, but it has helped me understand my pain better even when there is no obvious treatment option available to fix it quickly. \n\nFor example, I have a lot of pain in the tendons and ligaments *near* my problem joints, but not necessarily inside the joint or in the surrounding muscle tissue. My doctors advise me that tendonitis is likely the issue. For me, most tendonitis simply does not get much better after an infusion. I have found that ice packs, rest, and elevation will often help with these types of pain. I immobilize the painful area, keep it elevated, and keep it cold while it rests. Once in a while I will notice that type of pain will respond well to an infusion, but it certainly is not guaranteed like with a classic muscle bleed. My understanding is that sometimes an actual bleed will spill over and inflame surrounding tissues such as tendons and ligaments, therefore a traditional infusion will sometimes fix the problem. Sometimes these other tissue types get irritated and inflamed on their own and they do not respond well to infusions for me. \n\nIn my experience if the pain is in a soft muscle tissue or definitely deep down inside a joint, then infusion therapy is an almost sure-fire fix for me. If the pain can be precisely narrowed down to tendons and ligaments, then factor is often ineffective and I have to simply rest and apply cold therapy to the area. For me, a normal soft tissue bleed is almost exciting to have because I am highly confident a normal infusion approach will quickly stop and fix the problem. The tendon and ligament issues I have make me sad because they are often difficult and time consuming to fix. \n\nSome problems are easy to fix with factor, but some problems are tricky because we get old and our body just gets worn out and takes longer to repair itself. You hit the nail on the head in terms of articulating how I feel when I am in those varieties of discomfort.  I am 30 years old, not in the worst shape save for my right bicep and triceps suffering significant atrophy on account of severe osteoarthritis in the right elbow from repeated bleeds.  By the time I turned 21 I was in chronic pain and my orthopedist said that people in their 70s and 80s had more cartilage than I did.  I am grateful to be out of near-constant resting pain in what the same doctor calls a 1 in 500 patient improvement, but day to day stuff can still be hard, and as you know it can be a major morale sucker not to mention the constant drain on mental bandwidth when your \"spidey sense\" keeps tingling and making you wonder if you are having a bleed somewhere.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI agree with you about the psychological relief that comes with infusing.  I feel my body language loosen up almost immediately once I see the vein return and start the infusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the nonhemophilic episode related issues, I have found a good deal of relief in the form of a xanax prescription as it tends to relax my mind and therefore allow me to relax my body.  I otherwise find that stretching and heat therapy to be most effective relief in addition to the help of a massage cane my bandmate found on Amazon which reeeeeeeeally helps open up my tight spots that accumulate from having to compensate at the rotator cuff and shoulder.  I guess I am more grousing than anything.  On paper I have had it pretty good compared to other hemophiliacs I know.  I have been on an effective treatment regimen for the last 12 years without developing an inhibitor, I have never been hospitalized overnight or required any surgeries, but executive functions are still shoddy some days and I find I am unlearning the lifelong looming feeling of being afraid my body will betray me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you again for sharing your perspective. I know what you mean.\n\nI am 27 with severe haemophila A and I treat daily. I have some target joints that I know are bleeds instantly however other areas can be a little bit harder to diagnose.\n\nWhenever I get aches and pains I try to give it a bit of time before taking more treatment to see if it is in fact a bleed or just a case of over doing it.\n\nI know in my experience if something starts as an ache in the morning but can be extremely more painful by the afternoon then it is a bleed.\n\nI hope this helps! Bleed: that area swells up fast.\n\nSoreness/muscle sprain: that area swells up more slowly but likely due to inflammation.\n\nThe latter can be resolved by applying Diclofennac cream at the muscle cause the feeling of pain that is typically further away from the source. I have the same experience. 25 y/o severe Haemophilia B. It is a fairly common experience for people with the condition particularly those with pre-existing joint damage. It is something I struggled with telling the difference between, but now I am pretty good at it. It just came with time and experience where I can pick out the different feelings and sensations to tell whether it is \"oh shit, this is a bleed coming on\" or \"fuck sake, my ankle joints are killing me...probably just the arthritis\" to which I will take my pain meds if needs be and try to move gently through the pain. Obvious bleed indicators for me are a LOT of warmth, tingling sensation and a low lying throbbing. But, again...you can still get all of these with flair ups of arthritis too...it is a headache for sure man A bleed is internal bleeding in us hemophiliacs we get internal bleeds (a worse version of a bruise) much more so we call them bleeds soreness is like what you feel after doing something that takes a lot of work like working out and it is also a sign of a bleed so if you feel soreness in your joints look for swelling what would be the blood pooling but if you cannot tell if it is swollen feel if it is warmer than the opposing joints if so without a reason to be warmer infuse you likely have a bleed \nFrom-someone a hemophilia camp counselor I know this one well. Is it a bleed or just a rainstorm coming that is changing barometric pressure in my damaged joints?  \nTry taking a Naprosyn tablet and waiting two hours.

My VWF was low, so I am waiting on a hematology referral.

Was there any drugs that helped, or any treatments that you found that preserved your fertility? Diagnosis of vWD is tricky because our levels fluctuate so much!\n\nI for sure had menorrhagia when I used to get my periods. My last one was earlier this year and I bled very heavily to the point of almost passing out. The cramps and pain I do get, I think are the result of developing endometriosis and the like later on in life. When my periods were extremely heavy in my teens, I did not have as much pain.\n\nAs for drugs, I was put on tranexamic acid (a clotting booster pill) and an increased dose of my clotting medication. Those did not help, so I was put in a low dose birth control pill and it was able to regulate my periods to lasting about 7 days with only 3-4 of those days being heavy.\n\nRight now, at 34 years old, I am on Visanne which is a progesterone based hormone medication to help treat endometriosis. I take it continuously so I have not had a period since february. Prior to that, I was on continuous birth control and while it managed the bleeding, it did nothing for the pain.\n\nUnfortunately I do not have anything to suggest with fertility as I do not have kids, nor plan on having any. I have severe type 3 vWD and I am happy to answer any other questions :) If you are in the US Try to find a clinic that specializes in Women and Girls with Bleeding Disorders. They are usually associated with Hemophilia Treatment Centers. Both, I am no doctor but I think from pushing out all the blood it makes it hurt worse. Tranexamic acid massively helps me, when you get a haematologist, I am sure it will be brought up.\n\nOf course everyone is different, but this is what has worked for me.  I have vwd type 2m. I take kelnor but skip the inactive so I have a period once every three months. I have been using it for over a decade with no problem. I did have a lot of trouble finding the right pill. Amicar may also help you. Hi! VWB type 1 here! Its so hard with us because we will test positive and negative depending on where our levels are. Not sure about fertility, but for some birth control can help the bleeding. Just do not do an IUD - they will not stop the bleeding. As for the heavy bleeding and pain, 100% yes. It has. Type 1 here! Got diagnosed when I was 10 and was put on low dose birth control and DDVAP. The nasal spray helped the bleeding temporarily.

I typically infuse just once a month and that suits me. Shortly after my first infusions, I had a really difficult period of health lasting for a few months. Extreme fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, confusion, terrible blood pressure drops, fevers and chills. In February of 2017 I was diagnosed as having an active, high infection of cytomegalovirus. I am convinced I got it through my factor replacement therapies because I did not have it before starting infusions and was exposed to a very small group of people in the period between starting and getting diagnosed. \n\nHas anyone else been diagnosed with CMV? I know it is a pretty common and usually mild condition, but I have an autoimmune disease that probably made the symptoms much worse.\n\nWhat did you do after diagnosis? Were you able to make a case against the manufacturer? Is not vWD medication synthetic? If so I do not see how it is possible that could be the source.  Which factor product were you using? I have never heard of a single case of CMV in all of my years of using factor and being closely connected with a large hemophilia community.  You need to have a serious conversation with your hematologist, or who ever Rx\u2019d your meds. Hopefully you have kept infusion logs with the lot/serial numbers of the doses you have taken, maybe your insurance can provide a log of all med lot numbers issued to you. You may want to consider making an adverse event with the manufacturer. However, I do not think this is really the place to seek legal advice. Anything in here is anecdotal at best.\n There is one recombinant product but the standard for factor replacement for vwd is plasma derived. Humate P. I work in health research and was doing some reading today that indicated that cmv is harder to remove from factor products, and because it is usually not that bad when people are infected, companies were really reluctant to start processing that would eliminate it. I have not yet found an answer as to whether Humate production includes one of those processes that can remove cmv. That was my concern, too. I have all the records of my shipments, which might include lot numbers. I am also a little concerned that my doctors may not be willing to do anything with this conversation than say \"oh darn, that is unfortunate.\" Get in touch with the company directly. They have reps that will be glad to explain everything. You will get some info at least.  Humane P is pasteurized.  Lipid coated viruses are pretty sensitive to it.

I have never seen a specialist but I feel like I need to. Is there something specifically I should be looking out for? I had multiple bleeds with my ankles. The pain is always there. Constant cracking from simply walking. I have an appointment with my doctor hopefully we can do some physical therapy to strengthen surrounding muscles. But the joints are a huge problem. Makes it difficult and painful to run. Just have to endure it I guess. Did you turn your ankles a lot when you were skating? I am a mild, 33, and have not had a major ankle bleed since I was 20, but had some when I was a kid and am only now starting to really deal with ongoing pain. PT helps, look up your nearest HTC! Get in touch with your nearest HTC, they will be able to help you find physical therapy/joint specialists if you need it. Yeah my ankles have been giving me some issues lately as well. I tried getting back into skating like a year ago and my ankles really could not take it. I will mention that when I finally go to an HTC Thank you and mostly I had knee injuries when I was skating, but yeah I am looking at the ankles now and there have definitely been some issues there. Found an HTC in my area so I am definitely planning on scheduling an appointment. I imagine knee injuries would cause similar issues up the chain! My experience just happened to be ankles. Good luck, it is manageable! In a lot of ways us milds are weird because we do not think as much abt our hemophilia as kids, but the damage starts showing its ugly face in adulthood. Definitely not able to skate like I was used to afraid of missing work. But I can still cruise no problem. 100% Severe A and I skated a lot when I was young. My left ankle is in semi bad shape cause of it. \n\nI have osteoarthritis in my ankle and it hurts a lot from time to time. One day I can barely walk and the next day I can walk normal it is weird. I have changed my diet to a paleo diet and decided to workout so I can lose more weight for my ankle and so far it is been helping a lot. I did not know that what we consume on the daily inflames our body and that is what is been contributing to my ankle pain. My ankle would hurt even after taking my prophylaxis. \nSo ever since I changed my diet my joints would feel normal and as soon as I consumed a carb my joints would ache pretty bad.", "Has anyone here filed for disability?

To be honest most of my followers seem to be young parents with young Haemophiliacs new to the disorder. I have also been planning a video including my mum talking about her experience in raising a Haemophiliac. That is awesome! Thank you! I think for younger hemophiliacs (haemophiliacs?), a valuable video would be about finding and knowing your limits. There is plenty of content around recognizing bleeds and how/when to infuse and that sort of thing, but I think it is equally important to get an acute sense of your physical limits as soon as possible. Even as a mild adult I am learning there is things I cannot / should not do and finding out the hard way.\n\nI follow you on Instagram. Keep it up and let me know if I can help! That is a very good shout! I will look into that and see what content I can create!

I forget that outside of the UK it is spelled Hemophilia!\n\nThank you for your input and for following me! Young parents are basically The Worst, at least in the U.S., so that is a tough audience to market to. Hopefully your mom can talk about what it takes to stay grounded and not let the condition become who they are.\n\nThere is also an issue within the hemo momiverse where the new moms reach out to the older moms, who are all of the same opinion that what they did was the best possible thing and share that as the gospel, but what is being left out is the opinion of the actual patients who are now in their 20s-30s who can say \"yeah we did this but in hindsight I would have preferred...\"\n\nAll of the new drugs coming out - hemlibra, gene therapies, etc - are rewriting the playbook of patient care. Kids now do not have to suffer like we did 25-30 years ago and that needs to really be put out there. That is exactly it! I am only 27 but I see younger Haemophiliacs with so much more freedom now than what I had when I was younger.\n\nI feel part of the issue especially I am part of the UK is that some care centers are still very old school in the approach to Haemophilia. Inspirational pieces on haemophiliacs who are able to work in high risk environments. For the longest time, the conventional wisdom in other parts of the world was you are sick and cannot move.

I underwent ankle arthroscopy for my right ankle in June 2019. Best decision I made in my life. I have never seen so much money all at once That was my first thought. Speedy recovery, my guy. and I was here thinking about that time I got my wisdom teeth taken out...... good luck young blood! Yeah, I had my wisdom teeth taken out about 5 years ago and took amacar for that. Open heart surgery is a little more involved. I just do not understand why they did not send this to the hospital. Their hospital refrigerators are going to be more reliable than the one in the apartment I rented. I have a bit too much actually right now(i get 35x2000IE/month, to be sure to be able to take double when needed). I have been forgetful and missed a few times last months and now I am \"forced\" to take doubles each day so I can use up all that is about to be old. I got around a 100 doses at home all for about 1k/dose. Kind Of scary saying it out loud. And i feel so fuckimg bad having all of these and no way to like share instead, when I know how hard others have it. The way healthier works depending on location sucks. I donate old factor if you ever want to send it to people who need it, I know places if you want to PM me. It is not really a big deal if it is not refrigerated. Do not worry about it. It says right in the insert that as long as it is not stored at above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (around that depending on the factor) it is fine. Even then, it does not spoil it just looses a little efficacy after a while.\nGet well soon! Wishing you all the best!! I know of a senior hemophiliac who had open heart surgery and it went very well! Full recovery :) Hope they use tranexamic acid too. &lt;3 Yellow is 3066 IU and purple is 1095 IU.

Hip has been bleeding on and off for a month.\n\n", "Hemlibra safety? Hey all has anyone else been concerned that Genentech has reported 34 deaths since fda approval for hemlibra? \n\nIve been on it for a few months and love it but the increase in death numbers is trippin me out. Has anyone spoken with their hematologist about it or have more insight? Having a meeting with my doctor about it later. my doc told me lots of those cases were people who died while they were on hemlibra, not because of hemlibra. No because those are just the people who have happened to have died while taking the medication. The only linked deaths are due to Feiba being administered while taking the medication. The others have resulted from religious refusal of blood transfusion and natural causes. I have spoken to our henotologists extensively about this. What is feiba? Fieba is one of the current treatments for inhibitor patients that basically involves inserting a huge assortment of clotting factors all at once in the hope that their combined effect makes up for the lack of factor VIII. The mechanism it actually uses is not particularly well understood, but the guess is that because it contains activated factor IX, and that hemlibra is a sort of always activated factor VIII, the two combine to cause dangerous clotting events. Because of this, inhibitor patients now take novoseven for emergency treatment when on hemlibra as it does not carry the same risk. The good news is that no other product on the market carries the same risk of fieba, and I do not really think that it should impact anyone\u2019s thoughts on the drug today. Thanks for the detailed answer. I do not have inhibitors so that is all news to me. The only thing I have worried about since starting Hemlibra a little over a year ago has been my tendency to have a small bleed that I did not notice keep on going for a few days then turn into a big one all of the sudden. It is hard to get used to clotting/ not bleeding. So when I do get a bleed it is not as noticeable and I let a few go too long because I thought it was tendonitis or soreness, then I ended up with some damage. So I wonder if any of these deaths were brain bleeds or injuries that were not treated properly because they thought the Hemlibra had them covered. I have found that any injury or strain from overdoing it is enough to cause a bleed still. I do not get as many spontaneous bleeds or bleeds from doing little activities now. But I still infuse anytime I feel a bleed coming on. It is been my experience that if I am feeling a bleed starting then that means Hemlibra alone will not stop it. For me, if it has started it is time to infuse with factor. My son is only 7 month was diagnosed with hemophilia A severe. We is not at the right weight to start hemlibra...could you share anything you would of like to know when starting hemlibra or any advice.

It is really better to talk to your specialist about the treatment options for your child. Personal accounts of adults on treatment will not be the same... The ( of PEN, which I highly recommend US-based Hemophiliacs ( to, addressed this misconception on page 4 and continuing to pages 16-17.\n\nTo summarize, Genentech reported 44 fatalities worldwide since 2015 of people who happened to be taking Hemlibra, none of which are known to be *caused by* Hemlibra. During the same time period, 95 patients died worldwide on recombinant Factor VII, 34 patients died while on Factor VIII including Advate and Eloctate, and 88 died while on FEIBA.\n\nThe article specifically dives further into some of the deaths while on Hemlibra if you are interested in more details, but a significant number of deaths were people with inhibitors and people with acquired Hemophilia (which Hemlibra is not even technically FDA approved for). Wwe have an amazing hemotologist. It is just nice hearing from actual patients . It is not so much medical advice. I am looking for more general info.

I quickly got palpitations right after the injection was done, feeling warm and lightheaded.

For me, it was my right elbow and still is. Over the last years I have gotten into squash (I am right handed) and done some weight training. Here is some of my advice for you based on your post. Focus on finding a strength training overall program, learn barbells or something for your whole system. You will be far more rewarded learning how to get strong than worrying about how people see your arms. And hemlibra let us you do this. If you have to modify your program and get stronger everywhere else but your elbow for now, you will still make progress. \n\nSecond big point I will make is that there are amazing physical therapists out there who can help you do this, and safely. If you have money for it or insurance, try to find somebody who advertises \u201csports medicine\u201d orientation in their PT practice. Do not give up if the first one does not help you. \n\nGood luck! Thanks for the advice :)  \nI have surprisingly got well developed legs from playing football/soccer most of my life and for a long time I only used to properly train legs because of the elbow stuff, I was quite lucky to not have any issues in them or my ankles, chest and shoulder exercises are not that bad but, it is just anything that can cause them darn elbows to lock up.  \n\n\nI will certainly look into it and ask around, I just need to motivate myself now to get past this hurdle once again.  \n\n\nThanks again! :) On the workout aspect cant tell you much, I have severe hemo A, I tried to workout, very slowly with no factor because I had none and its a killer...now Im on profilacsi and thinking of starting kinetotherapy with profesional help of course...\n\nOn the hodie aspecte...who gives a f... on what other people say or think, I got left elbow skinny and cant strech it to the max and my right knee swolon but Tshirt and short pants any day of the week!!! Oof, elbows. \n\nMy left is pretty bad.  I have had multiple surgeries on it over the last 20 years.  First, was a synovectomy and the last two were debridements to remove bone spurs.  My elbow joint is not really much a joint anymore, when it bleeds it swells down my entire forearm.  The is nothing left to really contain the blood.\n\nI highly recommend some anti inflammatory like Celebrex.  Also speak to a surgeon to make sure there are no bone spurs which may be causing the locking.\n\nAs for exercise, you are going to have to start really slowly and progress really slowly.  It is better to use a 2 or 4 pound weight and do alot of reps with nice smooth motion.  Remember it is not just joint but all the other tissue which needs work.  The other thing is to use resistant bands, they do not put as much strain on the joint. \nThe first bit is going to be the hardest.  Once it gets stronger it will be become stable. Last year I could hardlly do a curl with a 2 pound weight.  I am up to 15 pounds now. I was able to do 20 push ups last week.  It was the first time I have done a push up in 20 years. I feel like I am starting to turn a corner. \n\nGood luck. \n\nI now have to work on my tricepts. Those have the hardest to gain strength in. Do you have a routine that worked for you? Nothing too specific.  Sittingon a bench, I starting doing curls but only did the range where my elbow does not lock. It is not full range in beginning, I have worked up to it.  As I gained more muscle.it helped stabilize the joint. \n\nI used  elastic standing.  Stand on one end of the elastic and do a curl.  It is allows you to easily adjust the tension. Slow gains in the beginning. Im also an ectomorph but it just takes dedication and time to get big. Also by far the most important thing is eat your fucking protein and creatine. One scoop of creatine and one of whey protein each and every day even if you done workout. Try joining a sport to if you can.

I guess I need to tell them I wanted to kill myself a bunch of times that night for them to take it seriously.\n\nI recently looked into CBD oil a little bit, and researched it online. Friend said the prices were inflated because so many places cannot buy it locally, but my local smoke shop(my friend recommended) turned out to also be fairly expensive.\n\nI woke up and called my clinic today about a prescription possibility hoping my insurance would cover it, so lo and behold, I get to hear about how it is OTC and not \"FDA approved\" or whatever.\n\nI would bought a little thing of four candies and tried part of one yesterday and a whole one today. It seems to help me ignore the *chronic* pain, which is really my main issue over acute matters. Opiates just are not a valid answer to minor chronic pain. I feel better, though, and this helps against my depression, but also my anxiety feels less disruptive because I feel fairly peaceful.\n\nHow can I afford this? The little bottle I got was $25, which I only afforded myself because I really wanted to see if it could help. I do not even care to push for testing/law bullshit because I know it will just take an eternity. I live in Indiana, by the way, so it is amazing they even legalized CBD again recently. \n\n~~This country~~ Capitalism is ridiculous.

I could see myself wanting to add some comfortable drinking to it eventually, but I also feel like having enough CBD would make me feel alright enough not to need the drinking. It is weird. \n\nIt is only my first couple days trying it though, so I cannot fully say how I would adapt.  I am trying to avoid starting up smoking again, so a CBD oil pen would be pretty amazing. I like to smoke when I am at the bar, so that would be a good alternative to bumming cigarettes. I feel like my body just cannot handle things anymore. Cigarettes and even caffeine ends up making me feel very sick and weird a lot of the time. Here is something I saw on a different subreddit about CBD tincture:  Careful coming off booze. Trickle down if you are habitual man the dt's are harsh. \n\nBut I completely agree, three applications of cbd in one day made drinking unnecessary. Kind Of magical.

I just ordered a $60 bottle of gummies just so I can see how I feel with a stable low amount for 30 days. If I am not mistaken, these candies I have got now are 50mg each. Weird labeling, so I do not completely know. If so, I took 50mg this morning and just completely passed out. Could not keep my eyes opened. The gummies I got are 17mg each, so I am hoping that is just enough to help me ignore pain and some anxiety without wanting to fall asleep. Really did feel like the tiredness I have felt in the past from opiates. Yeah the reason I ditched the opiates was due too the constant drowsiness and passing out uncontrollably. \n\nGood luck man. Cheers! So, A bit of warning. CBD products are in the supplement category(like multivitamins or other homeopathic stuff) so it is is 100% unregulated by the FDA for things like safety, potency, purity and ect. So, you have to find a vendor you really trust for one, and see what they claim for their manufacturing process and product, basically is this some person just making it in their dirty garage.\n\nAlso, when I looked at different products I noticed they typically also has other \u201cherbal\u201d substances in then, which hemophiliacs need to be careful that we are not accidentally taking a blood thinner. For example one CBD product I found had Willow tree bark listed as a ingredient, which people used to chew on for an pain killing effect and that is because there is salicylic acid or aspirin in it. Which begs question what is actually working here the CBD or the fact your taking aspirin. For the average person the combination could be good with no further complications, but for hemos I would be really careful to look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not taking something that might also hurt you.  Look for a recently trained palliative care MD.  You are correct that opiates are the wrong direction and other prescription drugs may be better. Yeah, I only wanted a few for emergency situations like the other day. The pain was so bad that I could not even imagine falling asleep, so I was stuck sitting there for 4+ hours close to tears.\n\nI have to admit, though, I feel like hemophilia will probably lead me toward an inevitable opiate addiction if my body deteriorates too much or I otherwise cannot find a safer way to control the pain. Try Kratom! You should definitely look it up for more information that I am providing in this comment. Kratom is a dried ground leaf in green powder form from Asia that \\(I believe\\) stimulates the same opioid receptors in your brain that opioids attach to. So it feels a tad bit like taking a small dose of opioids. I was prescribed Oxycodone following a surgery and learned the effects that had on me. If taking a 10mg pill of Oxycodone is a 10 out of 1\\-10, then Kratom can give me about a 4\\-5. It helps with pain, and also gives off a nice warm feeling in the chest and head like opioids do. There is a large subreddit, /r/kratom, and a great deal of information \\(and misinformation\\) on the internet about the plant. It is currently legal to purchase, but not FDA\\-approved. Because of this, there has been a big push to have it banned because its use detracts away from big pharma's profits, since people also use kratom to ween themselves off of opioids. I order mine from an online retailer in bulk, and it is surprisingly cheap. Many people including myself use it for pain to take the edge off, as well as recreationally. As a bonus, it does not detract from your abilities to function as a person, so it is not like alcohol or marijuana in that you can drive and operate machinery while on kratom. I hope this helps, and let me know if you want to know more about my experience with it as a hemophiliac. I tried CBD gummies and they really did work but I was a little worried because I read that CBD has anticoagulant properties. I am not sure how it compares to an aspirin but still a little worrisome.

I can manage the occasional pain with codeine based stuff, but the walking part is still troubling. Severe A, I recently switched from celecoxib to OTC 2x220mg Naproxen.

Severe A, use paracetamol with codeine and sometimes switch it with Tramadol Krka(krka European thing) 100mg prolonged effect. \n\nTramadol works 12h, so sometimes its enough even 1 for a whole day.

I would rather you do that then get too narcotic dependent or have kidney issues from long term NSAIDs. Severe A w/Inhibitors, my joints are REKT. If you are in a state with medical marijuana you should consider looking into it. They have products which contain a chemical called CBD which is a non-psychoactive (you do not get high) compound that has anti-inflammatory properties. I get this oil called RSO (Rick-Simpson-Oil) which is a concentrate, I take it 3 times a day and it has done wonders for me and my pain. I used to have to take vicodin all day, over a hundred pills a month. I am now down to around 30 because I only have to take them when I am actively bleeding.

Your username is very relevant haha, it sums up my reaction to cranberries, noticed I would have a bleed after drinking cranberry juice, and I was eating loads of dried ones as well, looked it up coz it was a change in my diet and bam! It sucks too coz I love cranberries :( Surely Oxycodone does not thin blood When I was in hospital I was being fed oxycodone for my bleed? I question this one as well. Combinations with oxycodone and ASA like the Percodan yes, but this is should not be an issue as a single entity product.  They may have given it to you because they thought pain control was more important than the bleed, especially if it was pretty well controlled. My doctors told me if I had a 104 fever that it is okay to take aspirin because getting the fever down is more important than any bleeding it would cause. \n\nAlso, some medicines on this list probably cause more bleeding than others. They may have decided that the additional bleeding would not have been a lot. I can confirm the omega 3! I was taking high doses for a week, thinking I was getting healthy and whatnot. I got spontaneous bruising, a finger joint bleed and an ankle bleed after 3 days of taking it. I watched in real time as a massive bruise showed up on my back. It was very scary.

It is only for those who have inhibitors currently.\n\nThat being said, FDA approval has been fast-tracked and is supposed to happen September/October area so until then, assuming it goes smoothly and gets approval, insurances will not accept Hemlibra unless you have an inhibitor.

Approximately nine days prior to hospital admission, he developed exercise-induced right hip pain that was treated with a total of three doses of factor VIII concentrate (31-46 IU/kg) on three separate days. Four days prior to admission, when the patient received his third dose of factor, he developed a severe headache. While he was initially suspected of having viral meningitis, the patient was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage on the basis of CT imaging, and treated with factor VIII concentrate administered two to three times daily. Over a 14-day hospitalization, his medical condition worsened despite the administration of factor and the patient died from subsequent cerebral edema. The initial diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage was reported by the investigator as not related to fitusiran. For a more complete understanding, the Company initiated further investigation of the SAE, including review of the patient's CT scans by three independent neuro-radiologists, who all confirmed on September 1, 2017, that the initiating event was a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and not a subarachnoid hemorrhage. As a result of this new information, Alnylam suspended dosing in fitusiran studies in order to further investigate the safety event, now considered to be possibly related, and to develop a risk mitigation plan. The Company also notified study investigators and global regulatory authorities. My god, that is terrible. I had to look up ( Like, did fitusiran cause a clot to develop in the brain?

I hope you best and you can definitely find people that need your help Yes it sucks. And it can feel so overwhelming. Your feelings are completely valid. And I am right there with you. Honestly, when I feel awful about it, I just take it day by day. Or even hour by hour. \n\nSomething that helped me out was going to therapy to talk about it and figure out why I would have anxiety about medical issues. Turns out, I had medical PTSD. I started EMDR therapy and I have been able to process a lot of my medical trauma. It does not have to be an extreme experience either. Trauma is trauma, no matter what it is.\n\nI hope you have some kind of support system. I am here if you need to chat! I think at one point or another all of us probably hate it. Some more than others I am sure. I feel for all the blood brothers that were given HIV/hepatitis by Bayer and the government, all over the world. Especially those who survived and have been living with all of it and still are.  \n\nI lived a reclusive and sedentary lifestyle on purpose, missing out on lots of opportunities to do things with friends because it was risky to my joints/etc... missing out on potential dates and relationships because they were highly active and I could not keep up... I also made some stupid choices with jobs and how actively I took recombinant... At age 26ish I started to fully understand first hand what all of those I had met who had joint damage were living with, my right ankle has quite a bit of joint damage/deterioration from me being stupid and not taking better care of myself. \n\nNow for the positive, I immediately took steps for the past few years to stay off my ankles as much as I can, treated preventatively WAY more than I ever have, and it payed off. I found out last month I have gained several degrees of range back in not just the prominently damaged ankle, but even my ankle that almost never has bleeds or pain. And I have just begun my transition to HemLibra a few days ago and am dead set on this year being one of the best of my life and doing a lot of things I have always wanted to do but have been reluctant to do or avoided entirely for most of my life... a friend of mine loves hiking and random adventures, and I intend on joining now on occasion. Might even finally let another friend get me in shape and build some decent muscle, he is only been bugging me about it for over a decade... I am not going to try to be Superman or anything crazy, I know it is not a cure, but from everything I have seen it is a huge step toward a better life\n\nThe real positive thing here is that we are now living in a time where options like HemLibra and gene therapy are prevalent, and other advancements are hopefully coming too. The risk of being infected with something from contaminated product is extremely low, basically nonexistent, and with products like HemLibra out there now, guys like us can have better lives, but better still the younger generations can have a totally different life and hopefully never have to experience the same joint bleeds and damage that most of us seem to have.  \n\nPlenty of guys on here including myself are happy to chat if you need to vent or want to talk about stuff. We have all experienced different levels of trauma, some of us even from the same things.  Just remember you are not in this alone. We are all in this together, keep your stick on the ice. it is called the Royal Disease (hemophilia A) and Christmas Disease (hemophilia B). not sure how positive that is but I feel a bit better for some reason........ Here is my personal thoughts, I know some here will disagree.\n\nI used to hate my Hemophilia.  I grew up through the tainted blood scandel and lost more than a few friends in their teenage years. I even list my own mother to HCV due to a blood transfusion she got. I started to get arthritic joints in high school that severely impacted my mobility.  I have lived with chronic pain for more years than I have without.\n\nAll of these things have shaped me to the person I am today. Outside of my family there is not one other thing in my life that has influenced me as much.  Here is the thing I learned about it.  I cannot hate something like that and not end up hating myself.  I do not have to like it but I have to accept it.  I struggled with it for a long time.\n\nToday I can tell you all the good ways Hemophilia has influenced me, besides the great people I have met.  Hemophilia sparked my interest in molecular biology and genetics which was the start of graduate degrees and my career.  It has taught me patience and compassion.  It as humbled me in more ways I care to count but without it I would have been so much more arrogant. It has also allowed my to put a lot of life into perspective as to what is truly important. \n\nI will never love my Hemophilia. But I like myself and my Hemophilia had a significant role in shaping me. I still struggle with the chronic pain and some anxiety.  Some days are hard not to get too down, I usually give myself a day to wallow but then get back to it. Completely agree. I was talking to someone about anxiety.  Living everyday wondering if that twinge is going to turn into a massive bleed. It is no wonder anxiety is high in hemophiliacs. \n\nI am glad you got the support to figure that out. I do not know how old you are, but I felt very overwhelmed in my teen years and I fucking hated everything about hemophilia. It sucks, and it can be really frustrating at times. \n\nOne positive thing I think of right away is that it can make you a stronger person, if you can deal with having hemophilia, you can deal with a lot of other stuff life throws at you. We cannot do anything to change the fact we have hemophilia (at least not yet) so the best thing for us is to move forward and live the best life we can and be grateful for the treatment options we do have. \n\nIf you want to vent more or talk a little more in depth feel free to dm me. \u201cI cannot hate something like that and not end up hating myself\u201d\n\nThis is spot on. Anxiety and depression are both very common in the community. I also have that fear of the \"next big bleed\". And honestly, all I can do is make sure I lessen that chance, is to keep up with my injections, do some sort of physical activity and live life. Nothing is guaranteed, even a clotter can have a major bleeding episode. \n\nNow, do I always keep up with my injections? Nope. Do I always exercise? Heck no, I really should. But I keep trying. And I am also on anxiety/anti-depression medication. I have been seeing more and more about EDMR.  How does it work? The worse for me is when you do everything right and still get hammered from time to time.  This is true for anyone just that hemophiliacs have a good idea how quickly something bad can happen.  Ignorance is bliss.  Unfortunately, hemophiliacs do not have that luxury.  We are taught at a young age, and rightly so, to be aware of our bodies and signs of bleeds. To take responsibility for our health. I feel like this vigilance has trained my brain to always look for the potential negative even if it is unlikely. \n\nI have found that both exercise and sleep are the most important to my well being. It is a bit of a double edged sword being hyper aware of our bodies. On one hand we can recognize bleeds begin to happen before they get worse. On the other hand, it makes us hyper vigilant and almost alarmist and paranoid.\n\nI have a friend with factor 5 severe hemophilia and she does not have access to factor (it is too rare to be profitable). So she needs full blood transfusions. Any pain or issue, she is at the ER begging for someone to listen to her. Everyone thinks she is doing it for attention, but she has no other care option. I have had to talk to her and remind her that,\n\nA) she did not choose to have this condition\n\nB) She has no homecare options\n\nC) It is the job of the medical staff to help her\n\nD) If the refuse, they must note in her chart that they refused care\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would be easy for me to say, \"just do not think of the negative parts\". But I think of them too. I do not have a solution, but I am right there with you with the health anxiety. Some days are better than others, and I think that is what keeps me going. Knowing that there will be more good days. Hmm, it is hard to explain, but I started seeing an EMDR therapist after an especially traumatic death of a friend, mixed with chronic health issues.\n\nIt is basically taking the part of sleep where your brain processes things, and helps you re-wire the traumas so that they are not so raw and fresh in your mind. All while being awake of course. ( is a much better explanation. It gets better as you get older. Hemlibra even more so. \n\nHemophilia also gave me leverage on being able to play a LOT more video games too. XD That is true on so many levels. Most non-haemato medical staff just do not care. When I was warded for an operation, the staff at the non-haemato ward just put off injecting the factor until I was almost late for surgery. Even after coming back from surgery had to keep reminding them to give me factor according to the schedule and not when they felt like it, which is usually much much later after the 12 hour half life. I had Spark gene therapy for Hemophilia A about 8 months ago and it has completely changed my life. My FVIII level went from 1% to a peak of 32%. I am now walking 3 miles/day and lifting weights. Before the therapy, I was lucky to walk any distance without having bleeding issues. I was never on prophylaxis therapy and was having bleeds about every 3 weeks. I have not had a single bleed since my gene therapy. Revolutionary therapies are on the way! Do not give up hope!!!", "Donating blood? I have always heard mixed responses about this. Am I allowed to donate blood? No.  You are not allowed to donate sperm either. No you can not. If you live in a country or area that has HTC's (Hemophilia Treatment Center) contact them for current educational information you should know concerning your disorder. No. There should not be \"mixed responses\". Do not donate your blood. Lol well I ask because if you google \"can hemophiliacs donate blood\" you get answers saying that you can bc it will not affect the recipient, but is not recommended....  They would not take my blood and I do not even have it. There was a question on the pre screen that ask if I had been sexually active with a hemophiliac or a carrier. My wife is the carrier.  I believe they have stopped asking this question recently. My wife frequently donates now, maybe a couple years running?  So if you are wanting to, you may be able to now.  That could be the case, I believe it was 2012 when I last attempted.  Honestly, they likely would not want our blood; certainly it is better than nothing, but if someone is losing blood and needs a transfusion, ours is likely not going to help much :)\n\nThe official answer is NO; the Red Cross specifically mentions people with bleeding disorders as being unable to donate in part due to the risk to the donor (blood donors are stuck with rather large needles!). You can read more about their policies (\n\nAs /u/dillion203 mentioned, until December of 2015 there were further restrictions on individuals who had sex with hemophiliacs; this is because hemophiliacs were treated as a population with a high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS (due to the \"Bad Blood\" scares of the 70s and 80s). In December 2015 the FDA reclassified hemophiliacs and no longer labels them as a high risk population; therefore sexual partners of hemophiliacs are now able to donate blood once again (as /u/bessle says); you can read the NHF's statement (and find a link to the FDA's statement) ( ", " Writing Ethics In Portraying Hemophilia In My Story Hello! r/Hemophilia I am working on a novel and am wrapping up planning some core features for the story!\n\nContent Warning: Contains depiction of high blood loss and vulnerability from important treatment, please do not read if these things are too uncomfortable to talk about. \n\nI thought it would be prudent to actually ask people with Hemophilia if my interpretation is faithful, things they think I should avoid and if I could feature anything \\*they\\* thought would represent them well. If you think my attempt is in poor-taste please let me know and I will cut it from planning. I would really appreciate if this was taken seriously because I plan on doing more than 100 thousand words on this and I want to keep my unconscious ableism checked. \n\nHere is how I had it planned out:\n\nThe story is told primarily through dialogue, and also will feature this character being taken from our world into a different setting. This setting does not innately support the technology to maintain their hemophilia, and as such this character is unable to give themselves factor replacement treatment during the beginning of the story. Unfortunately, the world is hostile to the characters that go there (via attacks from monsters, not heavily sentient entities,) so I assumed this character would be very vulnerable to being struck. The character has many motifs regarding blood and the physical body, in that they suffer Hemophilia and are transitioning character (hence are undergoing HRT). This character is also a writer, and has written fairly private stories about vampires as a way of coping with their struggles. A little sheltered by their sister until they were old enough to go to College, they desire freedom from their biology and are given a chance to take that, as well as all of it is downsides. Their friends are slightly protective of this character, but with time have gained the implicit understanding that this person does not need to be sheltered and actively resents them doing so. I was intending on them having a heavy blood loss scene as a critical part of their arc.\n\nI am very unsure and have done a few hours of research into the condition to check a few things, but there is no way I could be sure unless I consulted people who actually experience it so here I am.\n\nIf possible, I would really appreciate if there was a resource one could point me too in regards to living day by day with it, because, if my character brings their Hemophilia up I refuse to talk out of my ass. \n\nI appreciate your time, and if I have wasted it or have gone against guidelines, I will remove this post immediately.  I would be happy to have a conversation with you about living day to day with hemophilia. Thanks for getting back to me! Means a ton and I will definitely send a message The major thing I would mention is I tend to have a lot more pain from major bruising, internal bleeding, pain from arthritis after years of bruising in a particular joint, etc, rather than experiencing heavy blood loss from cutting myself. So if you plan on making hemophiliac injury the crux of your characters arc, that may be something to consider. Same here! In your short synopsis nothing seems egregiously wrong, and I know that someone else has already offered but if you would like to talk to someone else about living with severe Hemophilia I would happy to find someway to talk with you about it! Depending on the severity of Hemophilia that your character has a scene with heavy blood loss (due to injury/trauma) without the ability to treat can certainly be fatal - the details might be a little much for you to try to explain in the novel but I thought I would put that out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time to seek out people with the condition! Implicit ableism is unavoidable, but putting in the work to educate yourself is the best approach you could take! Yeah I read a lot about the different ways it affects the body. I was worried about the angle I would approach it from, since yeah it is sort of cliche-ing your condition to just boil it down to uninhibited blood loss. I read the symptoms you mentioned can be really dangerous too so storytelling wise it would not change the themes I was going for but would definitely increase the authenticity of the depiction so I highly appreciate your suggestion! Thanks heaps! Thank you for the offer, I plan on getting to anyone who has offered as I have time because I feel like I could learn a ton, and seriously I would want the character to actually do justice for people who experience it so learning a lot to build this character properly is an important step!\n\nI have not decided the severity but that is definitely a detail I would want to hash out. \n\nAlso I appreciate that people have been so nice about it, it really means a lot! I did some cursory reading but I knew I was generating from ignorance so I stopped myself before it went too far. Absolutely! Severity will have a major influence on how hemophilia affects your character's life - just like time period, treatment regimen, country of origin, etc...\nI have some experience working with kids/teens with bleeding disorders as well, so any way that I can help I would be happy to do my best! No problem! No problem! One thing to remember as well is for someone on HRT going from male to female will also tend to bruise and scar more due to the lack of testosterone, i do not know bad it is but I know it also affects these kinds of issues I am super glad you mentioned this, I read a study that said no study has been done on HRT for people with Hemophilia but I figured something would probably happen. I do wish I could learn about that though thanks! Going To echo what most people here already said and add a little more of the things that strike me. While death from a monster bite or assuming they still have guns/knives would be the biggest concern, as any gunshot or deep knive stab would end up in death without treatment, even with it. So major blood loss scene might have to result in character dieing to stay true without some emergency treatment at hand. I am going to assume they do a lot of movement and traveling which would seriously hinder this character. My personal biggest challenge is that literally anything could set off a joint bleed, specifically knee or ankle and the more walking you do the higher the chances get of a flare up or course this also depends on the severity of the hemophilia. I am not quite sure what HRT would do to a hemophiliac but it sounds challenging to me. Might want to try and find some more info on that if possible. Good luck and I hope you write a great story. It is hard to give advice on this because as a Hemophiliac I have always tried my hardest to life my life the way I wanted to in spite of having a bleeding disorder (to be 'me' and not just 'a Hemophiliac'), whereas this story seems to put Hemophilia in the spotlight over the character IMO.  One thing I can say is that you are right on track with the character resenting people for trying to shelter and protect them against their wishes.  I know people mean well but it can be very patronizing. The largest misconception I generally encounter is people think I bleed faster then normal people or any small cut will kill me (mild hemophilia).  The general outline you provide seems  to fall within acceptable parameters in my opinion... I would be interested in reading the published story. Inability to give factor at the beginning of the story means the protagonist has not been on prophylaxis? If so you may want to include how some of his joints have deteriorated and how he limps around and cannot straighten some of his joints.\n\nYou may have better insights asking haemophiliacs who are on demand rather than prophylaxis treatment - those tend to be in countries where Factor is not covered by insurance.", "Covid-19 vaccine and hemophilia I would like to pass on a few tips I leaned the hard way.  I got the covid vaccine today and have severe hemophilia.  Something anyone should consider is make sure you take your factor before. This had not even crossed my mind as I took it through work as a last minute decision.   No pain from the injection site but a few hours post injection i could feel my joints throbbing everything I hit my vape .  Felt like I was starting a bleed in every joint I had worked today on the job. Currently have an ankle bleed in the good ankle at 7 hours post injection.  Im told day 2 your arm hurts like you have been kicked so im not looking forward to that or what my ankles will have to say about it. Everyone i work around have experienced it slightly different so this may just be me but i suggest factor first. Will add updates. Thanks for sharing, hope you feel better soon!\n\nThe various Hemophilia organizations definitely recommend that severe and moderates infuse before the vaccine (unless you are on Hemlibra): ( Thanks for the update. I am mild B and thought it was overkill in the letter I received to take factor and tranexamic acid for 3 days when having the vaccine. Type A severe - took my meds the night before and got the injection the next morning. No extra bleeding or anything, just sore in the muscle from the Injection on the second day, bit no more than when I got the flu shot Again, thanks for sharing that experience that you have had.\n\nPlease do not take this the wrong way but I feel that some incompetence in form of your vaccine provider and also possibly some lack of education surrounding your own condition may have lead to your experience. \nMy Hemo centre have been giving out information about pre infusing before ANY inter muscular injection or vaccine since well, forever. Also, there is copied and pasted information available on pretty much all websites that Google provided me within one search of Haemophilia and Covid vaccine. I would start to invest in yourself and check these things out before hand.\nAs relating to the bleeds you said had started happening in every joint you had worked is more than likely due to the massive drop in your F8 levels as your body was trying to fix the tissue and muscular damage from the Vaccine needle - not the Vaccine itself. This would then lead to any stressed joins from today\u2019s activities starting to flare up as you had no F8 cover left until you then infused. \nI wish you a speedy recovery, but please try and learn to understand the limitation of F8 Prophylaxis and how quickly things can spiral leading to bleeds when your levels may already be pretty low. Just so others do not read the above and be put off by what is going to be possibly a population saving vaccine. Do not they give the vaccine subQ for hemophiliacs? It might be different for severe hemophilia, and I am Mild A, but I have never been told by any hematologist that it is necessary to infuse before an IM injection.  I am an ICU nurse and get a flu shot every year with no issues just the typical pain for a few days with some fluid being in that muscle.  Honestly I am surprised that it is enough trauma to the tissues to cause a bleed, but I have never been told that I need to cover myself with factor before and again I am mild so I am on the luckier side there. \n\nAlso, I did receive the first shot of the Moderna vaccine a little over a week ago and had no negative effects; the volume was about 5 times that of the yearly flu vaccine so there was a little more soreness in my shoulder but it was gone in a few days. So what is the volume of the Moderna shot?  Any idea how that compares to the Pfizer vaccine? Also a nurse and at the high end of moderate, IM injections have never been discussed with me by my hematology center with respect to bleeding. I will say that I have dealt with many people, irrespective of bleeding disorder status, who have generalized joint pain after some viral vaccines. Strange that, something that has been told to me since as long as I can remember. All shots have been given SubQ for this reason. \nAlso, nurse status means nothing to me in form of informative advice I am afraid. It is surprising to hear that IM injections are just given SubQ because they do not work the same way and I have very rarely heard of that being done, especially for vaccines, SubQ tissue does not absorb as quickly nor does it hold nearly as much volume as muscle tissues.  I mostly said that I was a nurse to give a reason as to why I got the vaccine so early on in its rollout but, being a nurse, actually a Hematology/Oncology Nurse and now an ICU nurse I have seen and experienced hemophilia and it is treatment on a wide variety of patients unlike most hemophiliacs who only have their own experiences.  So, I would say I have a more well rounded and expanded view on hemophilia and it is treatment than most.\n\nI mean, I would think someone would have the understanding to see the difference between a mechanic\u2019s input on vaccines administration and after care than a nurse\u2019s, when a big focus of nursing is patient education.\n\nTo be pretty blunt about it that is why we are in the position we are in with the coronavirus in general, healthcare workers knowledge and experiences are being ignored, questioned, or invalidated. No clue what the volume of the Pfizer shot was, the typical flu vaccine I want to say is ~0.1 ml while the Moderna shot I received was ~0.5 ml I can only base what I have said on my own experiences as being a haemophiliac. I understand the science behind the difference of both SubQ and IM as that is pretty basic. The impact of IM depending on the needle gauge size is something that needs to be bared in mind for me, according to all advice from HTC centre and also their online publications. Not propaganda. This vaccine from \u2018my knowledge\u2019 can only be administered IM so therefor I will be fine as I am on Hemlibra.... If I was on F8 prophy, I would infuse before hand to avoid a potential bleed and more bleeds in other target worked joints. That is pretty simple.\n\nI would like to think you have a more well rounded view but unfortunately different doctors and different nurses have different capabilities and somewhat sometimes outdated and incorrect knowledge based on their environment.\n\nLast note, there is nothing wrong with being questioned or offering personal experiences. And, myself and most people are more than happy to receive this vaccine and follow the rules to help stop this pandemic. Whilst not moaning about who/why and possibly how we are in this situation.\n\nEdit: May I also add, I am from the UK - where for me healthcare is not about what I can afford or how much money can get me the best care. Persistence gets me a lot further and also having a great relationship with Hemo care team. Your personal experiences should absolutely dictate your opinions on your care. But truthfully to tell OP that they must not be sufficiently invested in their own well-being came off as offensive. Pfizer is 0.45ml which is pretty comparable to Moderna. It is pretty matter of fact, not offensive. Invested knowledge in your own condition is a whole different matter to being sufficiently invested in ones own well-being. I am moderately severe and depending on luck, it is either no noticeable soreness or the whole injection site swells up like a red hot balloon after half a day. I have been told by family doctors that subcutaneous flu shots are not really effective. Not sure if that is true of SARS COV 2 vaccine.", "Should I bother taking a blood test? Dad is a hemophiliac. I am wondering if I should bother taking a blood test because I am a female, so I would only be a carrier.  My dad is a hemophiliac.  I had a miscarriage earlier this year, but I do not think that hemophilia played a role. Is it worth taking a blood test? My doctor says these tests can run in the thousands, and I would rather not pay more money since I have a PPO insurance coverage which requires a certain amount out of pocket. Hello Friend, it is not always the case for a woman to be a carrier of hemophilia. Sorry to hear about your miscarriage, but I am sure it was not due to the disorder of your father or anything. If you can, try consulting the nearest hemophilia centre. They might help you more. Have a nice day! Hello there! Sorry to hear about your miscarriage. The decision to screen is very personal but here is my two cents. If your dad has hemophilia, and if you are a carrier, your children *might* be carriers or have hemophilia.  Mendelian genetics at its finest.\n\nAssuming the point of testing is to determine the likelihood that your children will have hemophilia, I would not get screened now.  This test will not tell you if your children will have hemophilia or not, it will simply tell you the probability (( If you decide to have a child in the future, you may consider prenatal genetic testing.  Again, a deeply personal choice but one that may help you prepare for the future. If you are a carrier it is possible that you have a low factor eight level. Both of my daughters are carriers, one of them has normal factory levels and one of them is below 40% so she has what is called a symptomatic carrier. Which means she has symptoms of hemophilia. She is what is considered moderate. So she has heavy periods and when she hurts herself she has had to use factor a few times because she had bleeds in joints. But usually taking Stimate and tranexamic acid will help with mild bleeding (periods, etc.) but I believe it is good to get your blood tested eventually in case you have to have a surgery or something, so if you do have a low factor eight level you are treated adequately.  But it is not something that is an emergency, so if you cannot afford it I can see waiting until it is a priority. Most women go their whole lives not knowing their factor 8 levels, and they do fine. My mom had heavy periods and ended up with some joint damage, and now in her old age she treats with factor more regularly, because she has a pretty low level (I think somewhere around 25%). I hope this helps. My mother is a carrier and a mild bleeder, anything is possible. The testing can be cheaper if your Dad already has his genetic abnormality mapped.  There was a big study called \"My Life, Our Futures\" in which they intended to map as many of the hemophiliacs in the US as possible.  If you have that information, then you just need to have that marker tested.  That is way less expensive. So sorry to hear about your miscarriage. My dad took me to get tested because my older cousins were having children and were being tested. But we live in the U.K. and it is free here so maybe only get tested once you are pregnant again? First, if your father has hemophilia A or B, you do carry the same Gene as your father and are a carrier.  He only had one X chromosome being a male.  That X chromosome had the Gene for hemophilia.  You got his X chromosome or you would be a boy.\n\nSecond, you do not need genetic testing.  You need a factor level test.  You already know that you carry the the same Gene as your father.  What you do not know is how that will impact your factor levels.  Factor level testing is far cheaper than genetic testing and can be completed at most hospitals in less than a half-hour.\n\nI hope this helps.  Good luck. My dad has hemophilia  and I have mild hemophilia as his daughter... They thought I could not get it when I was little and was only a carrier... They were very wrong.... Now they know better. Run to get the testing! Yes this! I was at a national conference for women with hemophilia this weekend. Under 40 is now labeled mild hemophilia  not symptomatic carrier and should be treated just like me with mild. PS... Women can die in childbirth... You need to know if you need factor treatment at delivery. I know carriers who almost bled to death after delivering their kids and needed factor. That is good. It is been a long time of people like my mom saying they bleed just like someone with hemophilia and being told they are wrong. So many women at the conference had the same story. Makes sure they get their levels tested and establish a treatment plan with an HTC.", "Had my first use of tranemaxic acid and wow! I have been diagnosed with low VWF and other bleeding issues (heavy bleed) since the 90s.  Somewhere along the line, the ball was dropped and I was never referred to the hemophilia center.  Eventually I did not even have a hematologist even.  So, as you can imagine, I have had a hell of a history with bleeds, especially dental work bleeds.  It was \"normal\" for me to bleed significantly in office, continue to bleed at home and at worst, for days.  I had to schedule my dental work needed around my rbcs and iron count.  It caused a lot of problems.    \n\n\nToday, I had oral surgery for two big problems that required very invasive work.  We are talking mini-jackhammer to the mouth--probably the worst thing I have had to do in my dental history.  This time though, I had tranemaxic acid and I am going to sound like a total advertisement now because OMG, it works so dang well.  My bleeding was great. No panic in the office and questions of \"Are you on Warfarin?!\".  I clotted about an hour or so after my appointment.  I did pull my usual post-op bleed that was a bit heavy but I just realized I had not taken my next dose yet.  Clotted about an hour later.  Still no heavy bleed.  This time, I do not have a plastic grocery bag for blood soaked gauze to fill up next to my bed. I did not need a bag overstuffed with gauze to last for days.  Hell, I am alert. It makes me so happy that I could cry.    \n\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share this with people who I know would understand what it is like to not have the medications we do for even something as normal as a dental appointment.  Totally lifechanging. Congrats!! How wonderful to get some relief! And I am shocked it was offered to you decades ago!!! But glad for a new day for you! In case you are not aware, there is also amicar as an alternate if tranexamic acid is not available (although person I find TA to be more effective for mucosal bleeding as you are describing) \n\nAnd of course von willebrands factor infusions are also an important part of treatment (HumateP, Wilate, Von Vendi, Alphanate) \n\nAnd then some mild patients can use DDAVP (although more severe patients will not find this effective) \n\n\nMany option available to help control your bleeding! \n\nI am so happy for you to have finally gotten the treatment you deserve! Yeah, the Hemophilia Center was horrified as to what had been going on for decades. I have major autoimmune disease and Sjogren so I now have a decades history of dry mouth coupled with prednisone at work with my teeth.  Because of the kind of bleeding I do during dental work (heavy bleed, clotting failures), I have often had to space my dental care out for long periods depending on what my blood levels end up like afterwards. The only time that I ever was giving cryo and DDAVP was for a planned c-section on the Navajo Reservation.  That doctor actually listened and looked at my medical history.  The rest?  Nothing.  Just the dumb \"Are you on Warfarin?\" even after informing them that I have a bleeding disorder. We are definitely sticking with the TA for future dental work.  Yay!! \n\nStill clotted today so I am a super happy hyper squirrel who is staying still.  Might be the best/worst torture ever! :)  Thank you!!! Oh yay! I am so glad you are getting the right stuff now! It is so much easier when things are treated. \n\nI have surgery planned in about 8 weeks. I just got the factor plan from my haemophilia centre. It is so reassuring to know they are on board and the surgeon etc know what is happening. Yes! I was not sure what to expect but it was really nice knowing that there was actually plan instead of going in and having a situation where they completely forgot you have a bleeding disorder.  Not very reassuring! Really woke up bouncing off the walls happy this morning because this is so radically different from what I am used to.  Not used to being okay after severe dental work AT ALL. lol :D Good luck with your surgery!", "Gene therapies offer dramatic promise but shocking costs ", "Celebrex for joint pain Is it ok to take celebrex ? I was just prescribed for my knee pain by my hematologist but i am not sure what it is. Has anyone ever taken it? yes it is a good thing to take. it is a non steroidal anti inflammatory (nsaid). another examples of nsaids is advil. many nsaids have a side effect of thinning blood or affecting clotting in some other way, which is why we cannot take them. celebrex however does not work like this and is fine for hemophiliacs. it does not work like painkillers though where you feel pain, take it, and get some relief. for celebrex to work properly, it is levels need to be built up in your system over time, similar to antidepressants. i took celebrex for years and can attest it is very helpful. you will not really notice any effects though while you are on it. its more that after you are on in for a while, if you stop taking it you will notice your pain levels go up. so it is important to stay on a schedule with it and take it consistently. \n\ni should probably get a new script for it now that i think about it. Yes, I take it and it causes me stomach aches (look it up it can cause ulcers) so I also take lansoprazole, which helps. You only really notice how well it works when you stop taking it or forget to refill a prescription. Yes, as another poster said, it is prescribed for us because it has a lower effect on platelets than other NSAIDs (I believe that is correct, but if someone knows better, feel free to correct me). So, I have been taking it for years. Like some of the other Cox2 inhibitor NSAIDs, it had some concern about cardiac issues. But where Vioxx got banned, Celebrex has stayed on the market.  I will say, I felt no benefit at 100mg and had to go to 200mg.  And even at that, I do not think it works as well as a couple of Advil. But Advil and Alleve can really do a number on your stomach lining if you take them regularly.  My brother got a bleeding ulcer from taking Naproxen (which is the drug name for Alleve).  So, I take Celebrex pretty much daily. But if I have a really challenging day where I have to keep going, I will take a couple of Advil.  The Cox 2 NSAIDs were Pharmas attempt to reduce the effect of NSAIDs on the stomach. But in general it did not work out well, since some of them seemed to cause heart problems. So, I believe Celebrex is the only one still produced. To answer the what is it? Celebrex is a Selective Cox-2 Inhibitor and a Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory drug much like Naproxen or Ibuprofen. However, unlike Ibuprofen and Naproxen, both of which also inhibit the Cox-1enzyme which can effect platelet formation and clotting action, Celebrex ONLY inhibits the Cox-2 enzyme and thus does not effect clotting. \n\nAs for the anecdotal information? I have two end stage ankles. I am rather disabled at current and am trying to organize time to replace both of my talo-tibial joints with total ankle arthroplasty. I ALWAYS have pain walking. However, without a constant dosage of anti-inflammatory medication I quickly lose the ability to walk all together. Celebrex is very effective for me. Especially when taken alongside Acetaminophen/Paracetamol. It has given me back the ability to walk by and large. \n\nAs for concerns and side effects? Your doctor will have already weighed you options and decided the risks are worth it. But If you want to know more then I encourage you to do a bit of independent research. Celebrex does have a risk of causing ulceration in the stomach and upper small intestine. Also, there has been at least one Selective Cox-2 Inhibitor recall from the market. Very very seriously do NOT take more than prescribed and I would say never EVER take without food in your stomach. I would research and become familiar with the signs and symptoms of stomach and intestinal ulcers. These can be especially dangerous for us as bleeders but if you pay attention to your body and do not act stubbornly about symptoms you should be fine. Again, like every medication it has its risks. Your medical provider will have weighed that risk against your current health and pain management needs. But do definitely follow the directions and talk to your doctor about concerns. The more you know, the better.\n\nEdit: I should have added that it does not work like a typical pain killer or an opiate. It is not fast acting. It performs best over time. Endeavor to take doses on time and not miss doses. It will work the best for you that way. If I forget a dose it can take 12-36 hours to get back the full benefit. About your stomach aches, do you remember to take it with food? Some pharmacists will tell you that a glass of milk is enough, they are wrong. Unfortunately due to my end stage joints and weight my pain load is considerable. I am currently on the maximum allowed dosage of 200mg 2/day. I learned pretty quickly that anything less than a good snack was insufficient. A good snack or a decent meal has ALWAYS helped me with any stomach discomfort. If you do not already I recommend giving it a try. 100% agree about it is efficacy vs ibuprofen. 800mg Ibuprofen for two or three days and I feel GREAT! My current dose of Celebrex is 20mg 2/day and it does little more than keep me on my feet. \n\nAlso, you are mostly correct about Celebrex standing alone. Last I had looked it was the only selective Cox-2 Inhibitor currently in clinical use. At least in the US. Yep, I take it with lunch! I just take the lansoprazole 30 minutes beforehand and it seems to help a lot. In Canada it cannot be found OTC so I had to get it prescribed (in the U.S. I think it is just prevacid). \n\nI probably just have a sensitive stomach. The benefits definitely outweigh the downsides, in my opinion. Without the celebrex I can feel this awful feeling on the inside of my left elbow, almost like an itch that cannot ever be scratched. I take it 2x/day for chronic pain. It is an NSAID but does not cause bleeding because it is a COX-2 NSAID. A misunderstanding of the whole NSAID thing is that we cannot take any but we actually just cannot take COX-1 NSAIDs.", "Knuckle bleeds? Does anyone else seem to blow their knuckles and cause bleeds a lot? I have had 4 under a year and I do not hear people talking about these bleeds. If you have week knuckles that might be something to look for strengthening or maybe stop giving 100% blows everytime Not so much these days but when I was younger and playing basketball, I kept a swollen knuckle at all times.  You are not the only one. Definitely when I was younger, rarely now that my prophy is actually being followed. I was surprised to get one the other day because of the prophy.... I am a klutz though.. Yah I posted this earlier. Went to the store and smacked my hand against the cart and thought to myself \"of course I smack my knuckles against the cart right after I say I have not had a bleed since I was younger.\" I still get some knuckle bleeds but I also crack my fingers. I do prophy so I dont really worry. Had them all the time. Probably one of the more common bleeds that I got. Personally think they were mainly from being hyperflexible with my fingers.

I am in way over my head right now trying to figure all this out.  Call the insurance company, tell them u have Hemophilia, get referred to hematologist? Damn this is the most ignorant post to this sub since that idiot \"researcher\" from the other day and that is a low bar to limbo under. What? It is not like insurance companies are actively trying to prevent/hide us from hematologist. \n\nThe billing/fee/co-pay/deductible is whole another beast if that shit goes wrong though. You really have no fucking clue what OP is talking about, do you.\n Tbh, no idea.\nI have no idea what part of insurance process OP is lost on, care to fill in the context for me? &gt;What? It is not like insurance companies are actively trying to prevent/hide us from hematologist.\n\nDo you live outside the US or are you just 15 years old and do not remember back when insurance companies could deny people coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions? I have received coverage in both US and outside of US.\n\nIs OP having trouble finding an insurance company with reasonable policy that supports hemophilia or is his current insurance company denying him coverage for hemophilia?\n\nOr is he just confused on how to find the hematologist that his company will cover, or is he having issue with billing?\n Man you are totally fucking tone-deaf.\n\nOP is not necessarily saying \"I need help with a certain issue,\" they are pointing out that younger hemophiliacs who grow up on their family's plan eventually have to get their own plan and that shit is incredibly intimidating to figure out, especially with (for example) the constant situation of flux the ACA is in, state-by-state differences on insurance carriers, one's own evolving medical needs etc.\n\nTake a step back and think before you post some dumb shit. How the hell did you come up with that narrative?\n\nDo you just assume every hemophiliac in US is fucked after they leave their home? Where in my post did I make that assumption? I simply listed some of the many issues that OP could be referring to in calling for better education about the insurance/administrative side of the disorder.\n\nIt is the same principle as saying that high school kids should take classes on personal finance. You would not respond with \"lol just get a bank account suckers\", would you? Because that is essentially what you said in your first comment. You just came up with the whole \"Younger hemophiliacs who grow out of their family's plan is fucked\" narrative based on the OP's title.\n\nI did not see OP's title in that manner, because even if you have proper coverage, it is confusing as hell to figure out wtf is going on. I just simply do not see how you came up with that narrative based on OPs post about \"Insurance company is confusing\" &gt;You just came up with the whole \"Younger hemophiliacs who grow out of their family's plan is fucked\" narrative based on the OP's title.\n\nThat is simply one of many possible examples. OP said that young hemophiliacs should know how to deal with it early on, and I listed multiple reasons why that is the case.\n\nYou are just being obtuse because you had a shitty hot take to OP. I am sorry I offended you by not assuming the doomsday scenario for OP. I just thought OP had an issue figuring out how to deal with his condition/insurance company for the first time, without his parents to deal with all the details. OP specifically mentions \"insurance and how to deal with insurance companies\", what part of *any* of that makes you think they are asking about being referred to a hematologist?\n\nReading comprehension. It is for everyone. Amen to that. Just this week I finally got my new insurance plan and my new pharmacy all straightened out. It took a month to get everything processed and i had to ration myself with treatments but I made it. US health coverage is a bitch to navigate. Literally every step of getting coverage was a nightmare. It took three weeks to get my appeal approved. After that there was so much miscommunication between my insurance company and the pharmacy it was almost laughable. I got my factor with one dose left. Preach. I am a hemophiliac and I own my own company so I have two different levels of annoyance with insurance companies. I wish someone tried to teach me insurance. Honestly, I dunno if anyone can teach us about insurance to prepare for us for it. It is a fucking clusterfuck. My travel insurance (while in US, let us call it insurance C) initially confirmed that they would cover the treatment/prescription.\n\nWhen the hospital I visited asked which pharmacy is covered by insurance C, they told us to use pharmacy C. (Same name)\n\n2 Weeks after I receive my factor, I get the \"Explanation of Benefit\" saying that I am responsible for ~50k (100%) of the treatment. 3 calls to insurance C (2/3rd time with internal audit specialist, or someone like that), all told \"Your prophy treatment is not an emergency case\".\n\nLuckily, one letter from the hospital saying \"without this treatment, sars911's health will fall into an emergency case, this is an emergency prevention treatment\" solved everything. But goddamn, after everything I have done to make sure I was covered, they still tried to fuck me. lol Serious question, for other hemophiliacs is it hard to get on medicaid or medicare for their care?\n\nI had medicaid all of my life till i hit 20 and then i somehow got switched over to medicare. Like i dont even know exactly how it happened, but always worry about what will happen when/if i get kicked off of it. Not sure where you live, but your hemophilia treatment center(if you go to one) might have a social worker or other staff that could help with that. Additionally, the local hemophilia chapter might be able to help with insurance matter, or they might have an information day  with insurance sessions. Currently going through this right now. Coverage doesnt start until october 1st and I have 2 doses left. Nerve wracking to say the least ! Dude how did you do that? The state I am in you get coverage until you are 21 and then the attitude is basically \u201cget fucked peasant, figure it out how to get coverage yourself.\u201d The same thing almost happened to me, but thankfully the pharmacy just said they could not fulfill the prescription because I would be liable for the full cost.  Theoretically you now should have several more years of coverage under Obamacare, which was not the case when I graduated. I dont even know. My mom had gotten me setup with illinois medicaid growing up. Then randomly i got a letter one day (sometime after turning 20/21) that i was getting put on medicare and the medicaid (medicaid has since been dropped since i earn too much now).\n\nIm always scared what is going to happen if/when i lose the medicare. Idk how id afford the medicine/appointments copays on a private insurance.\n That is a standard part of my transition to adult care.  My boys start transition care at age 4 and at various points learn new things.  When 15, they are expected to talk with their home care co and insurance company and by 17, they are expected to do it without their parents help. OP cannot figure out his insurance.  OP needs to get a social worker at his local HTC to help him sort this out.  If not available, then a financial counselor at the local HTC's host hospital.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf he has no HTC, then he can get the contact info for the local HTC near him from the CDC's HTC search engine that is accessible from the CDC's hemophilia website or the NHF's website (for US users).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf all else fails, then OP can call a reputable non-profit credit counseling service (ie \"Credit Advisors Foundation\") and get his bills sorted out and his insurance payments sorted out, then his co-pays can get put on a payment plan so they do not blow up his budget. Health insurance or life insurance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHealth - I cannot comment (Canadian)\n\nLife - My son has been refused from 3 companies now This is a great suggestion.  Access to insurance impacts every aspect of my life and I did not know that when I made a lot of life decisions when I was young.\n\nEverything worked out well but I could have saved some heart ache if I was better educated at a young age  Do you mind explaining your insurance set up as a self employed person?  So I ended up having an agent at a local insurance company explain my requirements as an employer to insure my employees. I picked the package that covered my employees as best as possible. It is not ideal for my factor coverage but it works at extra cost to me, but it gives my employees the best coverage we could afford. Honestly I do not reccomend my package for a hemophiliac so I will not mention it. ", "New to r/Hemophilia I am new on reddit and glad to have found the group. We have an 8 year old son with severe B. For a number of years we were reluctant to join any type of group, online or regional hemophilia groups. That has begun to change as time progresses and Bubba gets older. He went to camp for the first time last year and loved it. Hopefully I will have a few minutes in the near future to go back and read through the past threads. \n\nI am pretty sure nothing prepared us to be hemophilia parents. The whole experience has made me wish we had reached out to others earlier. I think we would have learned things more quickly and maybe lessened the number of times we felt completely lost. The whole process has ended up as a book about our experience with Bubba. It is available on Amazon if anyone is interested.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what goes on in the group.\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B; \"We ignored the wealth of advice and resources already available and struggled for eight years, buy our book.\"\n\nNot exactly a convincing sales pitch. Not much goes on here aside from the occasional article/question. Unfortunately this sub is kind of dead.  How awesome is Hemlibra? Pretty fucking awesome! Tight bro, tight. Here in a couple months I will have a chance to try Fitusiran so i guess we will see how that goes. Any break through bleeds while on it? Not exactly looking to sell books as the primary reason for being here. Feel free avoid interaction in the future. Well, you came here with no post history and your post reads *exactly* like you are promoting your book including a link to where it can be purchased, so you tell me what your primary reason for being here is. The difference between this and other communities is that this sub is mostly patients who are looking for answers and we usually provide them bullshit-free.\n\nMoms in the other communities usually want hugboxes instead of answers. I am not on Fitusiran yet but it seems to work very well for the people that are using it. There is a small percentage of people that become immune to the treatment after 8 months so that is very unfortunate. Not the strongest look coming in with a sales pitch about your son. See u/dokool's reply to my comment, \"....this sub is mostly patients who are looking for answers and we usually provide them bullshit-free....\"\n\nThat is why this sub exists. Plugging something anywhere on reddit will most likely be met with animosity. Yeah, actual foundation chapters have really just been disappointing for me for that reason: the advocacy is not really advocacy...it is at best an awareness campaign but usually a way to support families of children with bleeding disorders. I am not saying there should not be room for that (this sub makes it clear that the people with the disorders are usually pretty realistic about things while parents who post here are looking for a lifeline), but it is hard not to see it as usually being present at the expense of resources for people with bleeding disorders in their 20s and older. \n\nI volunteer at a summer camp as a counselor and you see guys there who have an idealized version of how their lives are going to be in the states as they get older. And it is not hard to see why that is: anyone involved in the community is usually either a parent or a pharmaceutical rep (sometimes the former becomes the latter too, it seems). Camp is not really an appropriate time to have Real Talk with a 14 year old on how it is going to be, but I find myself correcting first-year, 18 year old counselors frequently on how things work with jobs, insurance, and college. There was even a guy a camp with hemophilia in his 60s who learned how to infuse with the seven year olds because he could not find a way to learn with help while at home. Yeah, OP's book is a joke. He is blaming his son's hemophilia on reckless driving and I have no idea what \"using good daughter as a pincushion\" means but it sounds completely unnecessary.\n\nThe piece of work is not his son's hemophilia, it is him. It is a bunch of mutual circle-jerking about how they have all got it *so hard* and \"I let my son play American football, sure he might risk permanent brain injury but it is his choice\" while all of the 20-something patients scoff in the corner.\n\nSo much performative martyrdom from *older* patients, as well. \"Infusing is my identity, I would never give it up for (Hemlibra/Gene Therapy/etc).\" Just FWIW, I have had a couple breakthroughs (or close) on Hemlibra, mostly on my target joint. During the trial I did RICE and it cleared up quickly, since the trial ended I have infused when things got sketch (such as the other day, actually) and it got better quickly. Depending on where you live chapters do plenty of advocacy (for example, lobbying for better health insurance laws, although maybe more chapters should get around to endorsing Democrats in 2020 if they ever want that to happen), but yes they have absolutely turned into support groups by and for parents.\n\nI am so glad I never got caught up in Bleeder Culture - it is just such a sad trip. I think there is a balance where we can advocate for ourselves and spread awareness without getting caught in such a sad cycle.\n\nLearning to infuse in his 60s, smh.

I do not see my hematologist for another week and a half but I have been really nervous because I do not like not having a treatment on hand. I know there are still IV options but I am wondering specifically about either nasal sprays, oral tablets, or subcutaneous injections I can administer to myself. I started on Stimate, but it was so expensive and did not really work in the long run. My doc put me on birth control when I was about 12 but honestly I bleed so much I will take other suggestions too You may want to discuss aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid with your hematologist. Both are oral options. Thank you, I have had good results with txa but have not heard of the first. I have heard of people taking txa for periods. Totally not vwd related but using organic tampons/pads, a menstrual disc, or period underwear decreased my bleeding. Conventional period products can have so many terrible ingredients that are endocrine disrupters and can make anyone\u2019s bleeding worse. Transexamic acid is what people I know are using now. It supposedly works better anyway. Also some people with vonwilibrands use Humate-P. It is a factor VIII product that is given Iv that has vonwilibrands factor in it as well. They are similar drugs. They act to help stabilise any clots you form. I have type 2 severe have taken txa after every bleed my whole life. Agree. My bleeds are better if I free bleed into period panties! Also I have a mirena coil which helps massively. Hello again. I discussed amniocaproic acid with my hematologist and we both agreed it was probably my best option, but when I get price quotes, it is like $55 a pill. Is that how much you pay? It seems steep \ud83d\ude33 Holy crap. Ugh. \n\nI am just a pharmacist, not actually a hemophilia patient, but that price does not surprise me sadly. I looked up the pricing, and $55 seems in line with what it would commercially be available for. \n\nDo you have insurance that would cover it? It would almost definitely require a prior authorization. Oh gotcha. Thank you.

My right elbow is damaged and I have had several surgeries, my right knee and left hip have been issues lately.  Its been a wild ride so far, lots up ups and downs, I have outlived allot of the guys I went to camp with, HIV really did a number on the bleeding disorders community.

I cannot exactly describe it, but my joints actually lock up from all the inflammation when I am even moderately active.  \n\nI have seen older hemophiliacs who are on painkillers. They take opiates like it is candy. I cannot function that way. I do not like that feeling. I do not understand how anyone would want to live like that. I need my mind to be sharp.\n\nFortunately, my job right now is just sitting behind a desk. But most days, I do not even feel like getting out of bed. Those first few steps after resting for a while are the worst. And I wish it was just my ankles. Every joint I have had a bleed in is now affected. \n\nThey are doing total ankle replacements now, but the procedure is relatively new. Frankly, after doing a pointless synovectomy on my elbow, I do not trust anything will help. I am contemplating ankle fusion now but once you do them, there is no going back. I am scared too because I personally know two hemophiliacs whose lives were adversely affected during such surgeries. Well, one of them died and the other might as well die.\n\nI know there are worse diseases out there. I cannot help but feel I have been handed a raw deal in life. My earliest memories are being in pain from unmanaged bleeds to now being able to fully control and prevent my bleeding but having to deal with the consequences joint damage. Fuck this life. For once in my life, I would like to wake up and feel good. I have been actively involved in the hemophilia community for years. But the fake positivity in the community is a little too much. We keep a happy face when interacting with younger hemophiliacs but when I talk to severe bleeders in my age range I mostly see a lot of miserable people.\n\nI am sorry for ranting. I woke up in the middle of the night from excruciating pain and I just felt like ranting to people who know what I am talking about.", "Switching from Benefix to Alprolix with Hemophilia B I have been using Benefix my whole life, but for the past couple of years my hematologist has been suggesting switching to Alprolix. Up until recently I have been only taking factor on an \"as needed\" basis, so I only infused factor 2-3 times a month, so I did not really think it was necessary. A few months ago I had my tonsils removed and was on prophylaxis afterwards. It is been nice not having to deal with bleeds so I have been keeping up with it since, and because of this I have been thinking about switching to Alprolix and was curious about others' experiences with this. Did anyone have a bad reaction to it? Were there any difficulties with insurance? I would really appreciate any advice anyone has on the subject.", "Should I continue clotting meds if the clots are blocking the urinary tract Hi!\n\nI have been peeing blood for the past few days. I am currently on an island with no available Factors (will be flying within the week to somewhere I can get some) so I have only been taking Hemostan-brand Oral Tranexamic Acid.\n\nThe blood suddenly disappeared after a couple of doses, like pure clear urine, but my side started hurting a lot. Yesterday morning I peed out a clot, the pain on my sides disappeared and I am peeing blood again.\n\nIt happened again last night, clear urine and side pain. I will not be able to see my doctors until I fly later this week, I am wondering if I should continue taking Tranexamic Acid even though the clots seem to be blocking my tract and are really painful? I have had this kidney issue happen twice, I cannot remember how I managed it. In both cases after going to the hospital, I was put on an IV for a few days. Thank you, hope I do not have to haha This sounds like something I would go ahead and go to the hospital for. If it were me I would take it seriously. Pissing blood is no good. Peeing out clots seems almost worse. Does not it seem like there should be a NHF hotline or something? Besides reddit! Maybe there is one. I kind of figured it was not something I could self medicate. I booked a flight off the island and am at the airport right now. Should have Factors when I land.\n\nThank you for the comments! Awesome good to hear. A penis is a terrible thing to waste. Lol! Umm... Female bleeder \ud83d\ude06\ud83c\udfb6\nI agree tho, do not want to waste those haha My experience of factor 8 is here in the ph they gave us a factor of expired and i was getting cold at that time like it has side effects when you try the expire one. Because its free, but the expensive factor 8 we cannot buy it everyday because its expensive the currency of dollar in philippine peso. 50 pesos is equivalent to 1 dollar. Type A? Is not that factor 8 only? Does that mean you are a symptomatic carrier, or , what does that mean, if you do not mind me asking. \nI am type A severe, so classic factor 8 deficiency inherited , less than 1%. Oh, and male. The ushe Symptomatic + carrier of the gene = has hemophilia. Most females with hemophilia have levels in the mild range, but can present more like a moderate or severe. Fluctuations in hormone levels, whether the person is having periods, and genetic factors (like x-inactivation syndrome) can cause someone to present more severely. Hopefully you are doing better. When I was in high school I started peeing blood for some weeks. My HTC told me to stop taking my Aminocaproic acid (amicar) and they put me on an iv of water or some sort of clear liquid and gave me loads of water. Took me out of P.E. Classes for the year and told me to stay relax. As far as I know they never found out why I peed blood. It happened twice a year apart. Anyways hope you are doing better. Yes thanks. Just usually women do not identify as type a moderate, or maybe they do, I guess I do not know. So I was curious of the reason. Like did her father have hemophilia, mother was a carrier. Or was it a mutation, or did she mean vonwillibrands disease moderate. Probably not the last one, I was asking because my daughter is a symptomatic carrier with factor 8 levels less than 40% and she uses factor 8 when needed. So using something like tranexamic acid , if it is causing clotting in the urine might not be ideal. Maybe she should use  factor 8 replacement. But thanks, have not heard of x-inactivation syndrome. I am glad people are better educated on things that make us bleed more (present more severely). I have always bled a lot more than some, and it turned out I had low testosterone. Testosterone replacement has made a huge difference in the way my muscles heal. I used to have bad muscle bleeds constantly. Head injuries and pain killer usage can tank your testosterone, so I wonder how common this might be for other hemophiliac men? I had a very large kidney stone earlier this year, 7mm x 10mm which caused a lot of bleeding. It was too big to pass and just it bouncing around in my kidney caused bleeding. Infusing did not make blood clots that clogged my urinary tract, but it also did not completely stop the bleeding - I think I was peeing blood for about 6 days before they figured it out and it was dark, almost purple pee. I imagine if you have a clot blocking your ureter you would suffer from the same pain as a kidney stone blocking your ureter and making your kidney swell. I am not a doctor and think you should see one immeadiately if you have blood in your urine. But this was my recent experience. My doctor has always warned me against taking trnexamic acid for urinary bleeds and one other area which I cannot recall now because I have not seen him in ages.", "Roche wins EU panel's recommendation for hemophilia drug ", "Self infusion: problem with veins. I am currently on prophylaxis but I have always had difficulty finding veins for infusion. My veins tend to be flush with my skin and do not pop out like most other people's do. \n\nAre there any techniques that you have found useful for increasing the chances of successfully hitting the vein with your butterfly needle? On the average, I use about three needles per injection as I miss a lot.", "Anyone over 30+ with knee problems have any sort of surgeries? Mostly a question for the hemophiliacs over 35, who had to suffer from days of doing nothing while the blood ate away at the knee joints.\n\nBoth of my knees have always been \"crunchy.\"  As far as I remember.   One of them is becoming painful... just aches.   If you take the knee joint into mind, it would make sense for the kneecap to be really worn, and that is what hurts...   Damn that thing hurts on the inside.   Probably the tib and fib as well.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?   I would assume since the kneecap is just a bone inside a big ligament, that it might be really torn up and an arthroscopy would benefit me greatly - or it is a toast leg joint.   \n\nI have seen a bit of info on lubrication shots, and cortisone is just a bad idea, in my experience.   The doc said the xray was not too bad, but not sure if he is being conservative and just does not know.  What are the possibilities there is large clumps in there that are problematic that an xray would not see?\n\nI think if you understand what I am asking till here, you understand what I am asking overall.\n\nI took a stethoscope to my knee.  Sounds like gravel!    Why has a doctor never done that before?  Would not that tell them a lot? I am 32, I have the same problems. Both of knees, left elbow, right shoulder \"crackle and crunch\" all the time. I got right shoulder xrayed, MRI'd, and CT'd. It is pretty bad. I need shoulder replaced. Ask your doc to do MRI and CT.  I am 35 and my ankles are jacked up.  I went to a orthopedic doctor who said he did not understand how I was walking so well.  I told him thanks but that does not really help. \n\nI have decided not to do any procedures on my joints until I am older.  I do not want a doctor to experiment because I just want to do something.  I only want to do a procedure if it is definitely going to have a significant help. \n\nI suspect medical treatment will improve over the course of our lives and even if it does I would rather do a procedure when I am old rather than use up that bullet at such a young age.  I have all the same symptoms with my shoulder, which is osteoarthritic. Crunchy, painful, limited range of motion. And it often hurt down into the humerus, not just into the joint. \n\nMy orthopedist said he would have recommended a replacement surgery if I did not have hemophilia. He gave me one steroid shot but it did not do much for me. But he did have me start physical therapy, too. I got extremely lucky with my therapist who had not worked with bleeding disorders but was a shoulder expert and quickly learned how far I could go.\n\nI do not have full range of motion and a lot of muscle mass still has not come back after four years but it is immensely better. It helps that I love working out and was looking forward to PT every day I had it, and had a great physical therapist. My doc was also accommodating by keeping my tramadol prescription filled.\n\nIf you do not trust your doctor to give it to you straight, definitely get a second opinion. I have done it before and will do it again. From what I know, joint damage done by bleeds that did not resolve properly do not leave fragments that would show up in an x-ray like you are asking (my doctors said there was just no cartilage left - the crunchiness was bone on bone contact).\n\nA joint replacement can really give you a lot of freedom back, but it is also a one-way road, and you are young enough that you will probably need the replacement replaced in your life.  I have had my ankle fused... so, yea... the body is going kaput as to be expected.    I do not want to depend on opiates...  I could, and be like House, MD except for i am not brilliant.  \n\nI have a really bad elbow that is crunchy...  It is OK because I do not use it to walk... but when the joints for getting around start to really hurt...  YEOTCH.   I told him I want an MRI, and hopefully it comes back where something can be done, that is not a replacement. \n\nHe said there appears to be a good amount of cartilage left.   I have been thinking about the kneejoint, and with the bleeds I had, it would make sense if the back of the kneecap was completely bone.  That is what I am interested in.   I bet there is all sorts of crap floating around in there.   Hard to find anyone who is done any work with hemophiliac, and thus would know what a 40 yr old's joints who lived until 15 without a quick shot at home, would actually be in real practice.   My ankle was bone on bone.  Hurt way worse than this.\n\nWhen I first got my ankle looked at and xray'ed, they said to go to physical therapy, which I did, which did some bad damage.  I was doing what they told me, and all of a sudden, as I got up, the ankle hurt worse \"inside\" than it ever had.   Not going to take that risk with this knee.\n\nThanks for giving me your insight and bounce ideas off ya! my elbow cracks and crunches all the time.   It is really frustrating to have osteoarthritis before 40. :(  \n\nWhat were your MRI results on your shoulder?       When I got an MRI on my ankle, it came back with the area of a quarter that was bone on bone.   I cannot remember if the MRI could see any 'junk' floating around though...  My surgeon said that I had a bone spur in my ankle, and to this day, I wonder if he could have filed that down, and left my ankle in place instead of fusing it.\n\nYou should be able to request a copy of your MRI and put it on your computer to look at it yourself.   It seems the consensus is that hemophiliacs over 30 are pretty rare, so not much is know about the morphology of our joint damage.   It is a crazy one, for sure.\n\nBest of luck with all your stuffs man.   Stay strong! It is bone on bone. I do have bone spurs. The surgeon said that he will clean up my shoulder.  Is your hematologist based at a teaching hospital? In my experience across a few states, the hematologists at educational hospitals who also still lecture tend to specialize in bleeding disorders, so they may have the best referral possible for you to speak with someone about it. In general I have been very lucky as I approach middle age and have not had issues with mobility aside from my shoulder and synovitis in an ankle that has not flared up in a decade, so your experience is definitely beyond mine. Certainly I would recommend speaking to another orthopedist. It seems like even if the x-ray showed \"nothing\" then your complaints at least warrant a discussion about fusion or replacement. Mine was quick to have this chat with me about my knee last year even though neither was eventually necessary. Do not hold back getting that surgery...  I waited years and fought getting my ankle fused...  those were wasted years.    Just an arthroscopy?   I assume they do shoulder joint replacements, but probably as a last resort Nope...  He is not.  He is got a lot of experience though.   I wonder how keen the hemophilia clinics would be to providing me any sort of data they might have.   \n\nHappen to know of any GOOD people out there at the teaching hospitals who might know about this sort of things that I could call?   Maybe PM me that info, if you like.   Thanks :) Replacing the ball and socket. It is been hurting and loss of motion. Cannot raise shoulder above shoulder level so I cannot reach higher places.  that sucks man.  You will be so much better after it is all said and done..  Recover is a PITA, but it will be worth it I hear it is PITA but hopefully it will be worth it.  I had a radiosynovectomy (probably spelling that wrong) done when I was in middle school in my left knee. All of my joints especially elbow/knee are very arthritic and generally painful overall but the knee I had it done in has by far the most motion and least pain on a daily basis. I am not sure if it is done as preventative or curative since it was so long ago but it is something you could ask about or look into. That is tough. I am sorry you are dealing with that.  Yah...  I wish they would have offered that to me when I was very young - around 8 or 10.   Would have saved my joints so much trauma.    I am too old and sedentary for that now, but tell the young ones! Thanks, it is one of those things that need to be done.  I had a bleed on my right knee at age 14 - before factor. It was treated with cryo-precipitate. Went in to hospital on January 1 and was discharged on January 31.\n\nThat was the start of nearly a lifetime of knee problems, with slowly increasing frequency until, at age 47/48 the bleeds started coming at monthly intervals. The orthopod did not want to do anything (\"Well, what should I do?\" \"You could try taking chondroitin and glucosamine supplements.\" \"Do not give me that shit; we both know those are useless\") but eventually agreed to do an arthroscopy.\n\nThat was in 2008 and since then - although the knee has swollen a few times - I have had no spontaneous bleeds.\n\nIn the post-op consultation I was told that the surgeon had cleaned out the inside of the joint. Thank you!     This is exactly what I wanted to know.   I grew up on cryo as well.  \n\nI have had probably 50+ horrible bleeds into my knees and ankles.   So the arthroscopy was good, overall?   After a \"cleaning\" of the joint, did you notice more flexibility?   I would take a guess he migth have catuarized a problematic blood vessel or two.   If you can go into any more detail about what was in the joint, how it was cleaned out, etc... that would help me and my surgeon out greatly, I am sure.\n\nI would love to see a surgery report, but I know they are a pain to get... You got to call the hospital and they might be able to mail it...  If you do not feel like it, I completely understand.\n\nWas your knee sounding like gravel and popping a lot, and being overall sore? Sorry dude :(\n\nSounds like my knee was never as badly damaged as yours is. In daily use, it was fairly normal. It was not sore, and it never made any particular noises. It was often weak, and would tire - but my no. 1 hobby for the last 20 years has been dancing, and my right knee stood up exceedingly well.\n\nThe one problem was the repeated bleeds, which became highly intrusive, preventing me from going to work, stopping, healing, then starting again. As well as being frustrating, it was very miserable as well.\n\nWhat I was told is that the inside of my knee looked a bit like 'seaweed', and that he trimmed all the loose tissue. I was also told that there was a small area, about the size of an old \u00bdp piece, where the cartilage had worn away and could be a problem in future. Apparently where the cartilage wears away, it is replaced by the body with something that does a reasonable job of protection and 'lubrication' as it were, but is not as good as the original.\n\nI have not got more flexibility in the knee since the op., it is still a few degrees behind my left knee. Nothing was said about doing anything to any blood vessels.\n\nI cannot remember the name of the surgeon who did the work, but if you like, you can message me and I will contact the Haemophilia Centre at Southampton University Hospital Trust and ask them to look at the record and let me know who the surgeon was, and your surgeon could maybe contact him directly? Just to piggyback off your comment since you mentioned glucosamine -\n\nI was taking it for about a year assuming it might not work, but I figured it was worth a shot for my shoulder. When I told my hematologist, he told me to stop taking it immediately. Not only are the benefits not exactly proven, but anecdotally many of his patients with bleeding disorders experienced more bleeding. My hematologist said glucosamine can affect platelet function and is not worth the risk for us.\n\nJust thought I would mention it in case anyone else like me thought glucosamine was worth a shot. It seems like it carries more risks than benefits for us. Glad your knee is doing better! Thanks, man.\n\nMy reading up on the subject was that glucosamine and chondroitin are ultra large molecules which cannot pass through the stomach lining, and are therefore broken down into component molecules by the digestive system. As a consequence, there is no point in spending money on them as there is no particular advantage over a balanced diet!\n\nScary that glucosamine might be a problem for bleeders like us.\n\nOmega-3 oils are another thing that we should not, apparently, be taking. Yeah, I was surprised when I saw the list. Even natural antiinflammatories like turmeric supplements (anything dietary is fine) are off limits by my doctor. Thank you!!! Sorry to necro your thread but I just found the sub. I am 30 and I just had knee surgery last year. I am severe A and have had inhibitors since I was 2 so my situation might not add up since I cannot even begin to tell you how many bleeds I have had in my knee, I even had one last a solid 8 weeks once with constant treatment. Last time I went to clinic Doc said my records were up to 2700 pages if that gives any indication. I had an arthroscopy, synovectomy and debriement (removing all those nasty bone chips and shaving down the bone surface that cause the crunching everyone is talking about.) The main reason I had the surgery was my right knee would not stop bleeding. 2 or 3 times a month and on crutches for 3/4 of the month. The removal of the synovium is what they said would stop the bleeding and the other stuff was just because hey they are in there might as well \"clean it up.\" I bled for 2 weeks straight after the surgery resulting in binding scar tissue building up and locking my knee in place. I then had what they call Manipulation Under Anesthesia, basically they put you under and bend your joint as far as it can go to break up all the binds. Well that caused another couple of weeks of bleeding. Longer story short two procedures, 12 weeks of physical therapy and a year later my leg is stuck straight, hurts every moment of every day and now sometimes gives out on me. Damn this was long, my point is just make absolutely sure you want to go the surgery route and you have exhausted all your other options. They want to do more surgery on my ankle next, and I am going to try and convince them to go with the radioactive injection that dissolves the synovium instead of having them cut me open again.  That is my pre-surgery x-ray so you can gauge where you are at if you have seen yours recently. Take a guess at which side was worked on.  wow man...     That is some rough stuff!    My xrays are not anywhere that bad, so maybe I should leave good enough alone until I am walking with a cane.\n\nFor what it is worth, if they are putting forward the idea of an ankle fusion, dont be too afraid.   Mine was great and allowed me to walk pain free again.    I wish you the best of luck with your knee... that sounds absolutely brutal.    You might ask them about a replacement ankle because you are going to be so much less active than the normal person, so it might last longer than the average?   Either way, fusion is a great way to go if you have no cartilage.   It is not really limiting to me at all, except I cannot run, but I was to the point where any sort of high impact running hurt all over anyways.\n\nMan...  Best of luck to you.   Thanks for the reply - we are such an outlier, most surgeons have no idea the outcomes of their work on us - we are just a different beast then they are used to. I am 32 with major damage in both my knees (lacking ~40 degrees to full stretch, fused kneecaps etc). I have been in a wheelchair since I was 14 years old, got rid of my inhibitors when I was 25. \n\nI have had the doctors tell me about different surgeries and I have turned down every single one simply because I do not feel bad about where I am at now. I do not have any major pains now after going almost 8 years without a single jointbleeding. I take no painkillers other than the occasional ibuprofen if some old injury goes down to inflammation Station. I am very mobile in my wheelchair and I can walk up stairs carrying it if I have to. \n\nI do about 12-24 miles of cycling each day to keep my legs in shape and bone-density at achievable levels in case a better replacement surgery comes along in the future. I keep the saddle at a height where my legs go about an inch before maximum stretch with each pedal motion. Cannot tell you the amount of power I have gotten back since I started doing it, and how much less my knees hurt when I use them in day to day motions. I use protein + Kreatine + BCAA + Multivitamin mixes each day to keep any gains I make and to keep myself fueled and good to go. My left shoulder is also 50% worn away, but I can still paddle kayak without any issues simply because I keep myself active.\n\nIf you can walk, your knees are less damaged than mine, and I would seriously recommend you to do some easy cycling on a good bike to see if that helps you in any way. I do not know if you have inhibitors or not, but if you do you probably should not be exerting yourself like I do. \n\n1. I do not worry a lot. My knees are shot to hell already, I have nothing to lose by using them until they are completely worn out upon where I will just get the replacement surgery and see where I can go from there. \n\n2. I am at a point where I would either sit still inside and mope and shorten my lifespan or get outside and do the opposite. You may not be there yet, unwilling to risk the health you have now. \n\nA lot of your pains can be eased by a healthy amount of exercise, i am sure, but also eat healthy and give your body the best shot at being healthy possible.\n\nKnee surgery is not risk-free, try to get a bit healthier by other means before you walk down that road. \n\nI would need more information about your status to know what to recommend further or otherwise. \n\n That is great stuff.   I fell off my stationary bike riding, which was a mistake.      Man... that is a rough roll of the dice there.   I do not understand how I had so many knee bleeds before the at home concentrates came along, but I can still get around.   I assume you can walk, or is the pain from using your knees so bad that you cannot put up the mental block to ignore it?   That is how my ankle was before I got it fused.    My knee is about where my ankle was 7 or 8 years ago.  I have been thinking a lot, and thanks to extremely insightful posts like yours, I have decided to see what exercise can do.     Got a kettle bell the other day...  tried doing squats - OUCH.  I have never been able to do this - knees have always hurt since I was 12 or so.  Just somehow battled through it.   And I am going to try to, and use painkillers (without getting addicted) until the \"wheels fall off.\"  \n\nThanks again for your comment.  It is really nice to see good people are still out there. I think - speaking from my own experience - that painkillers are not the way to go, not the opiate ones at least. Ibuprofen + Paracetamol 400mg/500mg would be a good place to start to see if it changes your experience with training. Anti-inflammatory meds overall would be the first course of action, but perhaps you have already been there. If you are low on factor concentration you should not take any Ibuprofen, but I do believe you knew that already.\n\nKettlebells and squats are great, but it might be too much if you have not done a lot of exercising beforehand. Cycling is great since you can choose your own pace, your amount of uphill/downhill + you can adjust your saddle until you find a height where you experience the least amount of pain.\n\nAnother reason to pick the bike first is that your spirits rise simply by being outside, and jogging is not very kind to your joints. \n\nI am glad you are getting active, it is the best choice :) I have been addicted to codeine.   Been there... done that.  No going back!     Squats are really difficult - i gave myself a thigh bleed just doing some basic ones.\n\nYah...  I should go buy a bike to ride around with.    Something to cheer you up here.\n\nResearch on genetic twins in a fitness lab has shown that muscle quality is not necessarily improved by being athletic your whole life. Two brothers, one a couch potato that had never touched a gym, the other an athlete who always kept in shape. Results came in and showed that the couch potato had superior muscle quality while the Jock brother ranked massively lower. Had the floppy one entered a gym for a few months he would be surpassing the other in no-time.\n\nI watched a youtube video with a PhD guy with his own lab speaking about how counter-intuitive it can be, but you do not lose out on future gains by having been inactive your whole life. 30-40 is still young (Just look at Floyd Mayweather beating the shit out of a 29 year old Pro MMA fighter at age 40 last night), and you have plenty of time to ease yourself into a level of fitness that suits your body. \n\nEasy does it to begin with, you do not need to exert/injure yourself to get something out of what you are doing. Gym-training is really not ergonomic enough for people like us, instead we should do the adjustable things like Swimming and Cycling, light walking and situps. Monotonous movements with set weights are really not good for your joints as a hemophiliac, you have to be able to pace yourself on the fly when you feel yourself getting tired. Lifting a 5kg weight is lifting a 5kg weight, you cannot change the forces acting on the joints from lift to lift :P\n\nIt truly never is too late. \n\nI had almost given up on myself a few years ago, but then I saw a picture my wife had taken of me and I thought \"Hey, I look normal...\", then took up exercising. \n\nWhat are your factor concentrations after an injection? I always take my meds right before I go out on my bike to make sure I have optimal protection.", "Gum bleeding dentist says nothing physically wrong they can find Hi folks. Factor XIII mutant here. Not on factor because my levels are within normal. My gums have always bled as long as I can remember when I brush.  They do not bleed every time, but once a week or so I would see a streak of blood. I brush twice a day, floss, waterpik, the works. \n\nHowever, the last year or so my bleeding has picked up to where it looks like I am a vampire sometimes when I brush/floss/pik. Not all the time mind you, but every few days now. I have seen my dentist, she cannot find anything physically wrong. No gingivitis, etc. She sent me to my regular doctor who did a whole workup. Nothing has changed. They are stumped. The hematologist says it should not be happening because my levels are within normal. He sends me back to the dentist, who sends me back to the doctor. Rinse repeat. \n\nIs this a thing? Or should I be pushing to have them look for something else? Other things, menorrhagia, nose bleeds, hematuria (no infection),  GI bleeds with no found cause (I have had 2 endoscopes, top, and bottom, fun stuff) and hematomas from anything from carrying something heavy to bumping into a wall or doorway (which I do often). Oh and SCH during pregnancy leading to repeated miscarriages.\n\nSo far, they have tested for Von Willebrands, that was negative they said. Factor 8 was low but should be fine they said. Factor 5 low, but should be fine they said. MTHFR positive as well. The best guess they can give is it is a mix of the 4 genes that are screwing with things. I have super heavy periods that land me in the emergency room. They have given me Tranexamic acid to stop bleeding and a steroid mouth rinse to try and cut down on the gums bleeding as well. \n\n I am the only sibling who has bleeding tendencies and we are a fluke due to two parents who did not know they had the gene passing on a double gene making it active for me. I have no one else that I know personally to ask and being one of the stupid rare Factor XIII folks there is not exactly a large pool of folks for me to ask. \n\nSo, what the fuck. Is this just another thing to add to the list of random bullshit that I bleed from or is there something else I should be asking my doctor? maybe.... just maybe..... you are brushing too hard? maybe you need a softer toothbrush?\n\nI am a male and two years around the same month I peed blood for the whole month. the doctors did not find any cause.... just made me drink loads of water, took me out of P. E. and told me not to take my amicar until the bleeding stopped.... have not peed blood for a while now.... it was weird...\n\n\nI bleed from my gums but I do not brush like I am supposed to... Thanks, when I wrote this last night I was irritated and a bit freaked out over the amount of blood I was seeing. I had brushed with no issue but the waterpik set on low had me spitting blood like I was some MMA boxer who just go punched. I use a soft brush, I am not trying to scratch my gums off.\n\n I feel you on the peeing blood, I was doing that last month. My pcm mentioned starting factor but my hematologist disagrees since my levels dont warrant it. So here I am, a mutant (genetic joke) who could side gig in a horror movie by just brushing my teeth apparently. ha! lol.. well hopefully you find yourself a solution. Are you softly brushing your gums? That can help stimulate the good kind of bloodflow and over the long term make them bleed less.\n\nBut some people are just more prone to bleeding gums through genetics. Even Hemophilia carriers can get extra gum bleeding and bleeding during surgery, even though they have a good X chromosome. Second comment, after stalking your post history\n\nVitamin C (for healing), K (for clotting), and D (inflammation and lessen effects of allergies a little) can help a little. But those are pretty basic.\n\nObviously having 3 different factor levels low could definitely cause extra bleeding. A second opinion might help? But it is probably taken you forever to assemble your current team of doctors that understand all your complications.\n\nI have to wonder if there could be something else going on, since there are already so many other things already present. My brother has Down Syndrome, and that gene mutation just causes tons of things aside from the obvious facial structure and intellect. For example, his teeth are very crooked, but hard as rocks; he is never had a cavity. He seems immune to brainfreeze from icecream, and has aphasia and autism.\n\nThe MTHFR gene mutation can cause gum bleeding, but some mutations can also make you susceptible to Leukemia. The initial symptoms of Leukemia could definitely go unnoticed because they overlap so much with your factor deficiencies. But I would think Leukemia would have been caught since your blood is probably tested so frequently. It would also make you more susceptible to infection, which would be horrible mixed with your allergies to some vaccines.\n\nThe other approach would be to see if you have a shortage platelets that are preventing those bleeds from closing up. But again, your blood probably gets tested so frequently that you would know.\n\nLastly, it could be another allergy that is only presenting as mild swelling in the gums. I am not getting the testing I should be getting. We are military and we move every few years so finding a care team is a bit of a PIA. We have been in Oklahoma for about 4 years now. They draw a panel at my PCM when things get bad and have sent me to OU hematology.  The hematologist at OU blew me off, told me that there should not be any symptoms so any symptoms I am having cannot be that bad or are not linked to this. He openly admitted to me he would never heard of factor 13 and googled it right before he walked into the room. He did not even send me for labs. Actually, he told me I was being a hypochondriac who must have heard about Factor 13 from Netflix. Would not look at the medical records I brought him with the genetic testing or the records from the various ER trips where they have had to treat me for clots and bleeding. The OK HTC will not see me as this same hematologist is their head. \n\nI have seen several other hematologists but none have any experience with factor 13. I went and saw Dr Escobar in Houston. He was unable to help but did go over all my files. He told me there was simply not enough research on Factor 13 and definitely not on this sort of combination of issues to be able to pinpoint any one thing. \n\nI am going to take your advice and see about being sent to another hematologist. I feel ridiculous though, I am not suffering like these other patients but damnit, I should not be bleeding like this and it freaks me out.\n\nRight now we are just going with, they do not know. I have only met one doctor in the wild who did know about factor 13. I use a soft brush on my electric tooth brush. My gums look healthy, nice and pink. The dentist said she cannot find a reason for why I am bleeding, she gave me a steroid rinse to help but you are not supposed to use it every day or long term. She sent me to my PCM who did the latest panel. It all came back normal. Personally, I am in South Dakota but drive down to Denver because they have a very good and dedicated program. Not sure where you are in OK, but Denver could be an alternative to Houston.\n\nUC Denver Hematology and Thrombosis center. They handle more than just hemophilia, and they have some great researchers who are on the cutting edge of things. Thank you. I will get on seeing if I can get a referral. Seriously, really really, thank you!", "HemLibra bad experience I had a bad experience with HemLibra where I had swelling in my foot and shin after I hit them by accident, those bumps lasted for 8 months after, and I switched back to Advate a couple months after those original injuries because I did not feel safe or protected on hem Libra. Doctors said I was the only one they know of with this side effect. Did anyone else have this experience? I have severe hemophilia A and am in my early 20s, for context I dont use hemLibra, but isnt the premise for the use of hemlibra is that it keeps your level around 15% throughout its acting life?. And if this is correct, it only stops spontantaneous bleeds in us severe people. Any bumps or accidents are to be treated with factor immediately. I did treat them with factor too. When I did, I got side effects that I have never gotten in my whole life before. A bruise like bump on my foot and on my leg that stayed there for 8 months even when I infused factor. It was gel like in texture and the doctors said they had never seen it before and did not know what to say. Even to this day (about one year later, I can still feel traces of those bumps) A bruise that lasts 8 months does not sound like a Hemlibra problem? At least not solely? It sounds like your doctors dropped the ball.\n\nIf you do not feel like it gave you enough protection, that is your decision, but not enough info here to judge conclusively. It was a HemLibra problem. Not a bruise. A fluid swelling. A side effect of the medicine, confirmed by my doctors. Sure it was not a DVT in the lower leg/foot? Yes!!! My doctors said they did not know what it was and they had never seen it before. My foot doctor said the same. It was just a small 2 quarter sized bump of swelling that felt spongey on top of my right foot. Same on my shin Not here to get gaslighted by people in the comments. Not cool Nobody's gaslighting you - you wrote that your doctors could not figure out what was happening to you, and I took you at your word. It is understandable to want to vent, but maybe get your story straight before you post it. (\n&gt; Women are more likely than men to suffer adverse side effects of medications because drug dosages have historically been based on clinical trials conducted on men, suggests new research from UC Berkeley and the University of Chicago.  My story is straight. Doctors cannot figure out what is happening to me and that is why I posted here to try to find out if people had similar experiences. Not to be told more about my situation by someone who has no idea what I experienced in the hospital. What a loser Does not sound like it is straight - you have edited your original post several times (making it impossible to know what you have actually written) and been nothing but rude to people responding to you. It sucks if you have had a bad experience - not all medications work with everyone - but you have not represented yourself very well at all and maybe you should reflect on that. Hi all, just hear to say, if someone comes on to share there experience with a medication, it does not seem very nice to do what you did in the comments above. Instead of being condescending because people have extra time on there hands to be on these hemophilia reddit forums, we should keep it open minded, not assuming or jumping in where your opinion was not asked for. Our opinion *was* asked for - OP wrote that their doctor had no clue what it was and \u201cthat sounds really fucking weird, they seem to have dropped the ball\u201d is a valid response. Everything after that is OP being unnecessarily defensive and changing their story multiple times, deleting their own comments etc. I have been following this post and it is obvious that there are discrepancies in the story which, upon questioning, leads to immediate defensiveness and cries of \"gaslighting\" from OP. Generally, there is usually pretty good conversations and support in here. So fucking weird. /u/sunsun123sun has gone back and forth with everything they wrote with multiple edits/deletes, tai_astrology jumped in out of nowhere, attempted to defend sun, and then deleted their account, and now /u/errorcurious poofs into existence out of nowhere. Very strange way to pass the day. I have not heard of anything like this. I would be annoyed too if people did not think I understood my own body, and thought I could not tell a bruise from a weird anomaly. I would look to see if any of the other drugs using this same delivery system cause anything similar. There are other drugs that have been around longer that are similar in that they use the same delivery system. I do not know what it is called but it is there in the Hemlibra info. If there are side effects it is likely that it is related to that. Since it does not sound like a bleeding problem, sounds like more of a weird side effect. Id like to hear more about this if you can think of anything else or describe it better. Please be nice. We try and be a positive community around here. thanks. Yes! It is pretty frustrating to not only be invalidated by doctors because they just wanted me to know how awesome the drug was, but then also to be invalidated on here on reddit by someone who seems like a hemLibra representative or something cus their handle says \"ask me about how awesome HemLibra is\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure but yeah it seemed like a fluid filled bump that stayed on my foot, about the circumference of a quarter, sphere shaped, and then a similar bump on my leg when i bumped it good idea re: subcutaneous administration drugs and similar side effects", "NIH Grant for Point-of-Care Device to Monitor FVIII and Hemlibra Levels  How do we get this device?

So this is my first post on this subreddit so I would like to introduce myself. I am 25 year old, 5'5 male, with a slim body frame turning 26 in June and have been diagnosed with Hemophilia A since birth (My older brother has it but after checking family lineage, no one from my mother's line had it that anyone currently alive can remember). Throughout my childhood ( I unfortunately did not have one) I suffered from chronic bleeds. I could not play outside because every time my head or nose would get warm, not hot but warm.. I would immediately  bleed. The remedy was easy. Pinch your nose, lay down and relax for 5 complete minutes. Do not move, just pinch your nose with ample pressure and then let go slowly as you release your fingers so the blood clot does not tear causing a bleed again. That method worked but it was a constant battle for years. Every single day, multiple times a day.. It affected my ability to do many daily activities. Later down the line, those nose bleeds stopped and then my body decided to come after my joints (elbow and ankle). I managed the internal bleeding (inflammation) using Factor XIII recombinant. A normal cut on the hand would take about two to three days to heal and a swollen joint would take three to four days to heal. By the time I was 23 years old, not only was Factor XIII not as effective but I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as synovium build up in my right ankle. Synovium is a fluid that develops in your joint and eats away your cartilage slowly. The pain turned me into a cripple and the Factor XIII did not heal me as effectively anymore. After research and recommendations, I opted for surgery. On June 16th, I underwent a procedure known as subtalar joint fusion. \n\n\"The subtalar joint is located just below the ankle joint between the talus bone and the calcaneus (heel) bone. The main job of the subtalar joint is to allow for side-to-side movement of the foot and ankle. This movement aids in walking, especially on uneven surfaces.\n\nA fusion surgery locks bones together and is appropriate for diseased joints that cannot be replaced. Once a fusion heals together, it acts as one unit and can restore function and provide significant pain relief. Generally speaking, fusion also is very durable.\n\nSubtalar fusion is performed to either correct rigid, painful deformities or instability of the subtalar joint, or to remove painful ( of this joint. During surgery, this joint between the talus bone above and calcaneus bone below is removed as the joint surfaces are fixed together. The goals of subtalar fusion are to decrease symptoms and allow improved function with less pain\" - ( \n\nI do not have inhibitors and dosage was adjusted every few years based on my body weight so it is not that Factor XIII was completely ineffective due to being immune to it after a long time. I decided for myself that there are better infusions out there so I decided to ask. My Hematologist recommended Hemlibra and so I did my research. I asked my Hematologist the feedback regarding Hemlibra from other Hemophiliac Hemlibra users as well. She told me that many have gave positive feedback. One of those is regarding the infrequent dosing (only once a week). Hemophiliacs are required to give prophylaxis which goes based on the half-life of the factor being given. The half-life for Factor XIII in my body is 12 hours meaning if I give it at 12am on Monday, by 12pm on Monday it will be at 50% then 12 hours later it will be 25% then 12% and then anything below that is useless and your body cannot heal. So give or take within 48 hours, there is barely any left in your blood. The half-life of Hemlibra is a few days however. Hemlibra is only to be taken once a week and your body will have 30% of factor at all times unlike Advate which you have to take every 48 hours for prophy(It was such a drag..). I was told that even though I will be on Hemlibra, if there is any serious bleed, I should also take my Advate if necessary otherwise I would not need to and so I switched! So far have completed 8 weeks of Hemlibra. Not a single dosage of Advate was given during this time. I feel great, no side effects and I only have to infuse myself x1 a week ( I chose my thigh). Hemophilia and the care you need to give yourself definitely takes a toll on your physical health but also your mental health. I hope you and your families are all doing well during this pandemic and just know that even though there is no treatment, there IS ways to live a better life. \n\nAs time goes on, I will keep updating this post with how Hemlibra is going on a 3 month time span. If anyone has questions or needs help, I will help you no matter who you are. Just ask :)\n\nI would also like to note, I have left over Advate infusions ( 2000 UI) in the box that I have not used. I donated my old Factor XIII to patients before who could not get access to them. I am willing to donate them to you if you are having issues getting the treatment due to insurance coverage or other reasons. Please get in touch.

I was avoiding knee replacement surgery due to bleed issues. I am already suffering in frequent joint swelling, it is been 25 days since, i am able to walk. Since, very few hospitals can perform surgery for hemophilia patient in India, also factor-8 cost is very high in India. 90% of operation cost is goes only to Factor-8. Even managing my financial issue, any one went through any major surgery. I want to know about any complexity. Pm me. Maybe I can help U can pm me I can help I am from India as well ,from Pune, one of patient from our chapter got his both knee replacement surgery, he got most of the Factor 8 free from Pune Hemophilia society. So contact your local Hemophilia society. Try Christian Medical College, vellore. I did my sugery there back in 2014 due to my knees being permanently bended because of all the bleeding. Did surgery on the same leg twice. Once to correct the position of knee and implanting steel rod for support, second one was two years later to remove the implanted steel rod. I can walk fine now, thankfully no complications yet. Thank You. I am also Tamil Nadu native. Last year(2019) I was admitted in CMC vellore for a month because of my appendix burst/peritonitis. They treated me with anti-biotic to avoid unnecessary surgery.  I am supposed go there for my leg pre scan activity but due to Covid lockdown and numerous personal issues, I postponed.

I am a bit sleepy, so if something gets missed or you would like further explanation, feel free to ask. \n\nI have Severe Hemophilia A, before surgery I did a loading dose, during and after surgery required a lot of factor, along with blood. After surgery during recovery, I needed IVs at home, and you will need consistent treatment.\n\nThe swelling will be quite severe, my leg got massive. I spent a little over a week in the hospital about 10 days. Rehab, and relearning to use my leg took about a good 6 months to get back to 100%. \n\nIt is extremely painful, I am not even going to lie about that, prepare to need strong opioids for a bit, and then wean down. \n\nRehab is honestly key to recovery, and you have to have a good physical therapist, you got to push it, but you cannot go too hard like normies, and ice, ice, and more ice, constantly. \n\nTomorrow I can send some pics my knee for you. Before surgery I basically had no cartiledge left. My knee would lock up and swell and it was hell. The surgery was even worse, but for me, it is been worth it. \n\nI luckily had an amazing surgeon, one of the best Hemophilia doctors out there, and good therapist. My knee is one of the top 5 replacements he is ever done, and I have basically 100% mobility, I would not expect that. The knee took a lot more work than my hip did tbh.. \n\nI still get bleeds in it from time to time, but they are muscle bleeds from damage that was done to the muscles from before the surgery, that you cannot really fix too much, but they are only usually with heavy activity. \n\nFor the most part, my knee is mostly pain free now. It is lasted me 15 years now, and the surgeon thinks I can hopefully get another 10-15 years out of it, bc a second replacement, is uhh really difficult. \n\nLong lasting factor also did not exist back then, so you may need less, but it is a major surgery, and there is still a huge risk. A lot of ppl in my men's group though have had replacements done. Woww, thank you for your help. Thank you for your open feedback.  I am 32 years old now. My left knee is in very bad condition, due to limited fracture and swelling. I cant fold them much. With pain I am able to do my PhD in Electrical Engineering. Now, I have to do post doc in University of California, LA or CalTech but without surgery it will be very difficult for me to manage alone in United States. The doctor said, knee replacement in my age will create enormous issues at age of 45-47. I am confused to go through it now or not. Also, I am scared of event after surgery with limited resources. Currently, I am going through too many bleeding episodes. I will be needing your advice in the near future. If you are okay, I can get in touch you. Now, kindly sleep tight. Good night. Feel free to reply here or DM me. I also use discord if you have that. \n\nI had my knee replaced at 21, I am 37 now and it is still going really well, and they have hopes I can make it to 50 or longer with it. Again, I had an amazing surgeon, so I cannot hold that to what everyone else gets. I try to be careful with it of course still. \n\nA second replacement is indeed an issue, will not lie about that. I will also say though, after my knee replacement, I was very cautious about getting my hip replacement done. I put it off about 4 years longer than I should have, and well a lot of extra damage was caused to the surrounding area.\n\nMy hip does not have nearly as much pain, but recover and range of motion is now severely limited bc I put it off.\n\nUltimately, a replacement is a big deal, it is very scary, painful, and a lot of work to heal. That is not even going into the money and resources issues. You will be on mostly bed rest for a good month at least.\n\nI would love to tell it is no big deal, and go for it, but it is a big deal. Only you and your doctors know your situation and health. I can only share my specific experiences. Thanks a lot. It is very helpful. Now, I am saving for my surgery .

I cannot fully stretch my right arm (around 176\u00b0) and, althoug much more durable now, I still have to be careful with how much I can strain my elbow. The problems with my ankle are quite minor but I cannot run for long periods.\n\nI always avoided sports where I could when I was younger and as I had found my \"calling\" in music it did not really bother me that much.

Your doc can work out a schedule to keep you at your highest levels or suggest other treatment options. Be careful self medicating with extra product. was the type of kid to not stick to my prophylaxis and just infuse a lot extra on demand.\n\nI am no expert, but nowadays I would worry about spontaneous clots or provoking and inhibitor from taking so much product. I can only calculate the amount left in the system due to half life. Since you are wrestling, factor will be consumed due to your injuries. In general, you will want to raise your factor level to that which is safe for wrestling (no idea how much that is) and also do you need to continue to infuse after that like after a major surgery due to the injury not having healed and factor being used up due to consumption? I recall there was a chart with some Bayer or Baxter product trial that listed down the amount of factor to infuse depending on the severity of injury, but that was specific to that product since it was pegylated.\n\nFrom the above analysis, you need to consult your haematologist to work out the numbers.", "How do you dispose of needles etc if you unbox all your factor stuff to make room? Not asking for a friend. ...you do not put all of your needles in a sharps container? Chat to a local animal shelter. The vets there gladly take all my unwanted butterflies, gauze etc.  What do vets need used needles for? Do not have one. I usually just put them back in the same box as all the used needles are safely covered anyway, but lately I have had too many boxes and I want to dispose of them before usage. I am just not sure if it is okay to just throw the used butterflies etc away. But yeah, they are safely covered. Not what I was asking, but great idea! I usually just take them back to the hospital after a while. Oh, sorry. Thought it was the unopened extra ones he was talking about. back to the corner with me :p ah sorry- thought it was the unopened ones you were talking about, and not the used ones. You should have a sharps container for the used ones :) Pretty sure he means the unopened ones, I struggle with the same issue, I only need one infusion kit for every 4 boxes of medicine that I use but each one comes with an infusion kit, so I am leftover with loads of unused, unopened syringes and needles. Are those reusable?  I am surprised you do not get a sharps bin from the hospital, I would ask them for one if I were you, I would be very surprised if they do not supply you with one. Yeah, sorry. The used ones are obviously put in a sharps container :p I am turning green with envy. My hit rate has improved from 33% to about 66% but still far from being able to hit the vein each time. I end up having to buy extra butterflies of my own.\n\nAs for the syringes, I found the extras useful for doing nasal irrigation.\n\nTLDR: the only excess stuff I end up with are the boxes and the instruction sheets. Oh, obviously! I will ask tomorrow when I will go for a supply run. Thanks!  Pretty sure sharps containers are sealed and then incinerated. Could be wrong as I have never actually seen the nurses bringing a flamethrower to torch them. If you cannot find/afford sharps containers, an old laundry detergent bottle works well. You really should never stick them back in the box, honestly. Once a needle\u2019s opened, even if capped, it should go to a sharps container.  Always happy to help out a fellow bleeder :) Ah that is unfortunate, d'you mind if I ask how old you are? I only started self infusing last year at the age of 26 (long story, meds were not easily available and I would be forced to go to a hospital for treatment where I lived before I moved last year, and now I self treat at home)\n\nWhen I was younger it was very common for nurses to miss the vein or have it slip out. I think I'v only slipped out of the vein one time and I have not missed once so far, but my veins are in pretty good condition at the minute (touch wood!) so that makes it easy for me, I am also slightly ambidextrous and tend to rotate the infusions between 4 different veins (2 on each arm) to try and limit the damage to them. Yeah that is ridiculous. Call your homecare provider or HTC and get a goddamned sharps container. Do your veins pop out nicely when using the tourniquet? You need to find that sweet spot below your shoulder and above your main hand muscle (does that translate correctly, lol?). Makes things a lot easier for me. Personally, I disconnect the butterfly section from the syringe. I will recycle the empty syringe (it is just plastic anyway) and put just the butterfly/tubing in to the sharps container. This has helped save a considerable amount of space in the sharps container so I do not have to go keep getting new ones. You mean the forearm? The part of the arm between the elbow and the fist? Nope, just above your triceps. Hemophilia research nurse here, we give our patients sharps containers and have them bring back with full but some of our patients just use a plastic juice bottle as it is thick plastic and has a wide opening. They bring us the bottles and we destroy no charge.

I have a 10 month old with Hemo B. According to their ( this therapy has not been tested in humans yet.  My amateur estimate is that it is still six to ten years away.  The good news for your son is that there are several good extended half-life FIX products that are currently available.  In the near future I also expect there to be one or more subq products that will be approved to treat Hemophilia B without replacing FIX.  There are also at least two FIX gene therapy products that could be approved in the next two years, although I do not think they will be suitable for children. Thanks!  I know about Uniqure's gene therapy that is very close to being approved.  Lots of good things to look forward to.  My son is currently on a weekly dose of Benefix, its working well so far. I think the Spark/Pfizer gene therapy is also close to being submitted for approval.\n\nIs your son being seen at a HTC? Hopefully as he becomes more active they will consider an extended half-life product. Yeah we regularly visit our local HTC.  They will consider extended half life when he gets a bit older", "An Old Hemo Joke  Lol. That is actually hilarious. Why thank you. You have any hemo related jokes?", "Anybody dealt with Hip Bursitis? I have a really bad right ankle..and I have developed some really bad hip bursitis and I feel like it is related. I take Celebrex to ease both but it does not always work. Any experiences? No. I think most hemophilia s have so many problems because they do not infuse enough. I know it is hard for so many reasons, but if you can do it I really think it is the answer to most problems.  I will second blueishblackbird's statement.  About 6 or 7 years ago my hematologist retired and the new doctor coming in doubled my dosage and switched me to a prophylactic treatment schedule and it made a world of difference.  Of course I was in my mid 30s by then and the damage was done so to speak but I feel better physically now at 42 than I did at 22.  I have not had experiences with bursitis either but plenty of continuous issues (like all of us).  You may already be on a solid dose and treatment schedule but if you have not tried it before, try doubling up on the next couple of treatments.
