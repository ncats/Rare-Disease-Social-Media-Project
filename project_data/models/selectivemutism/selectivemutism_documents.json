["To Those Who Mock, Belittle &amp; Bully People With Selective Mutism, Fuck You. Almost every person I come across does the above to me. No one treats me like a person but rather a thing to just make fun of. There was one time I was sitting in the school van(we do not have a bus) and this girl started mocking me for my appearance and for being silent. This other girl was like lol she can hear you but nobody gives a shit apparently cause they all laughed at me. I overheard the same girl mocking me AGAIN with these other girls and bringing up my family (cause why not) mocking my name cause its weird I guess. I have faced this for 6 FUCKIN YEARS NOW and I am tired there is no point in me going to school as I do not pay attention in class and I just sit there and daydream for 10 years while listening to people occasionally badmouth me.(this happens everyday btw)", "Nearly sucsess story When I was at a very young age I lost trust in people and lost my cofidnce wouldnt talk outside the house or nothing . till I got to high school my confidence got better gained trust in most people . I talk to most family member but I do not talk at school and I do not talk to certin people still . but I got acepted into collage and spoke in my collage interview Thank you for sharing!! No problem", "Selective Mutism: Giving Kids a Voice with Dr.Annie Simpson ", "A meme I made for my brother... ", "How to help a friend? I have an online friend who is a selective mute. We have been friends for quite a while now. We always get along well when we play online together I assume because I do not like sharing my voice online as well (?) So I often put on funny accents to hide my voice. Enough about the situation, though. \n\nRecently this friend decided to speak to me for the first time ever. I know that the decision was tough for him (I have another friend who he speaks to all the time when their alone online) and I do not know what to do. Right now I am just acting like nothing has happened but I am not sure if this is the best way to support him? I just want stay cool and adapt without putting him on the spot. Any selective mites who could shar insight on how you would want me to react to you guys if you spoke? You have got the right idea by not making a big deal about it. Just keep treating them exactly the same as before. You are a good friend :) I prefer when people do not make a big deal about it. You sound like a very good friend for him.:)", "I wrote a long message to open up to my friends about anxiety and SM. Thoughts? So I recently decided I should be upfront with my friends by sharing this information with them--that I have GAD and SM, that is. I spent maybe an hour typing this yesterday night (or early in the morning? lol it was like 2am at the time). I want to make sure it is perfect before I send it, though, so I would appreciate it if you guys read it and gave me your input.\n\nWhat should I add/change/remove? What kind of vibes or messages do you get while reading it (interpretations)? I do not want to look like I want attention or pity, because that is not my goal at all--far from it, actually.\n\nAnyway, everything after the dot/dash is the message. I replaced names with asterisks for privacy.\n\n\\-\n\nHey guys!! Sorry this is so sudden... I hope I do not bother you too much with this, really you can just ignore this if you want. I just kind of had this thing weighing down on me for a while, like... a long while... and I felt bad for not being honest. I hope you are okay with me saying all of this.\n\nNot going to lie, it is taking a lot of courage to share this with you guys, so I would appreciate it if you guys could not hate/dislike me after reading this.\n\nSo... where should I start? My problem... I guess I should first give some context? Well, I have been struggling like this since I was almost 5... perhaps before? I can say for sure that I first started exhibiting symptoms when I started school (Kindergarten), anything before that is not within my knowledge or memory.\n\nI guess I could say I have had this problem my whole life? Or at least, for as long as I have been more consciously aware of myself and a time I have the earliest vivid memories of.\n\nIt is something that I cannot see myself without since I have had it for so long. I cannot remember a time in my life where I was not like this.\n\nShould I be more specific now? I am being so vague like this... I should be more direct...\n\nI have been diagnosed with two conditions, though I am half-sure about a third diagnosis from a previous therapist. I will focus on just the two, though, since the third I am iffy on.\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder. This first one is easier to talk about in relation to the second, and is much more recognizable, so I guess I will talk about that one first.\n\nAs the name suggests, I have a lot of anxiety. It takes its toll on my mental and emotional health more often than I would like, but I guess that is just a part of it. As for physical symptoms, I usually get nauseous. I feel sick. In more extreme scenarios my body trembles violently, my vision blurs, and it becomes hard to breathe. I have to sit down and give myself time and space to calm down. I get anxiety attacks.\n\nI often overthink and beat myself up for little things. Minor inconveniences send me spiraling down. After mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks I am more prone to any form of negativity, which makes it hard for me to recover. I struggle a lot, and live with feelings of anxiety and fear everyday.\n\nThat is why, during the few times we meet up, I am so spaced out or exhausted. I get overwhelmed and it shows like that. I am slowly working on myself so it does not happen so much again, so until the time comes that I am no longer overwhelmed, please do not mind me.\n\nNow, the second one. It is much harder for me to talk about. I have told few people about it, and never went in-depth about it. I never discussed it directly with any of my past therapists, for some reason, either.\n\n...It is a very specific social anxiety/phobia known as selective mutism. It is supposedly a childhood anxiety disorder, and it was for me, but I am nearly 18 now and still struggle with it everyday.\n\nI am sure you have probably never heard of it. Most have not. In a nutshell, it is anxiety-induced mutism. If it does not bother you, you can always Google it.\n\nI have probably only ever verbally spoken to one teacher, if my memory is correct. I have spoken to one other person at school in the entire time I have been going. I speak only to a small handful of my relatives/family. Other than those people and you guys, I speak to no one else.\n\nI have never said \"Here!\" when I am called during attendance. I have never presented my own project without someone is help, if I even give a presentation at all.\n\nLess than a dozen people know about my condition, without counting you guys.\n\nI never or rarely told anyone because I feel immense shame. Jokes, nicknames, reputations, treatment, public humiliation. More often-than-not inflicted by my own family, especially by those who know. I struggle with that often.\n\n\"The quiet girl\" and \"The girl who never talks.\"\n\n\"If you were (in a bad/life-or-death situation), would you talk if it saved you?\"\n\n\"I bet (this thing happened), and that is why you never talk.\"\n\n\"Do not you know? Your dad and I are best friends, so it hurts a lot when you do not talk to me. Speak for me, right now, will not you?\"\n\n\"I will not (do this thing I am actually obligated to do for you) unless you talk/beg.\"\n\n\"She must not talk because she hates us.\" or \"She does not talk to you because she hates you.\"\n\n\"It is my birthday today. Will you please talk to me?\"\n\n\"Hey \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. I do so much for you, just talk this once and I will not tell anyone.\" or \"We are alone right now, no one would hear you if you spoke to me. Could you just say 'hi' this once? I will keep it a secret!\"\n\n\"I will cry if you do not talk to me.\"\n\n\"Just talk, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, haha. What? You cannot? Are you mute or something?\" and \"Haha, it is like someone pressed the 'mute' button on you. Are you a TV?\"\n\n\"What will you do about the future? How will you get a job? Do not be so stubborn and start talking. You are not a kid anymore.\"\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* it is been so long since I last saw you!! How long? Like, half a year? I miss your voice! Talk to me!\"\n\n\"Wow, I heard overheard \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* talk at (place) and she sounds like (description)!\"\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* only talks to me because (stupid reason)! She does not talk to you because (other stupid reason)!\"\n\n\"Oh I thought you were deaf, haha. I thought you were just really good at lip reading.\"\n\n\"It must be so embarrassing using a whiteboard/notebook to talk to others. Are not you embarrassed?\" and \"Do not do that. Using a whiteboard? What the fuck? Who even does that?\"\n\n\"Why do not you just fucking talk? Everyone hates you because you do not.\" and \"This is all your fault.\"\n\n\"You are better off just running away.\"\n\n\"Demon\" and \"Bitch.\"\n\n\"\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*'s scary. She looks like she will murder me in my sleep, haha. She does not talk either, so it is scarier!\"\n\n\"Do not you know that your deaf cousin wants to talk but he cannot? Yet here you are, completely able to talk, and you still do not? Wow.\"\n\n\"You cannot have friends unless you talk.\" or \"Do you even talk to them? How could you call them your friends then?\"\n\n\"Every conversation with \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* is so one-sided. It is hella awkward/I hate it.\"\n\n\"Do you understand English? Yes? Then why are not you saying anything? Are you stupid?\"\n\n\"If you do not talk to me I will call the police. For all I know you could be hiding something. I can have the police come here and get it out of you, or you can make it easy for yourself and just tell me.\"\n\n\"Why do you need to see a therapist? Talking is easy. Just do it. I do not understand why you cannot.\"\n\n\"You are hopeless. You are never going to get better. Go back to your dad. I am sick of you.\" and \"I am sick of your shit, \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. Just fucking talk.\"\n\nIf I talk, rumors spread like wildfire. If I talk, more people, family or near-stranger, try to force my voice out of me. If I talk, everyone will bombard me.\n\nWhen I do not talk, rumors still spread like wildfire. When I do not talk, people will even pin me against walls and threaten the voice out of me.\n\nIt is like that for me. The things people, like my mom and older brother, say to me despite knowing about my condition/situation make me feel ashamed. I feel like my condition is stupid, that me struggling with it is stupid. So I do not tell anyone. I am afraid they will treat me like my mom does.\n\nThat is why I never really said anything to you guys. I do not mean to be rude by saying this, but I have heard a few similar things from a few of you guys too. That is why I hesitated so much to share this. Even as I am typing this now I am scared.\n\nStill, I hope you will at least have the decency to not say anything hurtful, and be more respectful/mindful of my conditions.\n\nI guess now since I said all those things I should explain why I did. I actually wanted to a long time ago, since near the beginning. I felt like you were all kind and understanding people--I see now that is true for the most part. And it is just that I am only now opening up. I wanted to say something for once. Since it is you guys, I was able to pluck up some courage despite all that hesitation. I am also hoping this will serve as an explanation about some of my behaviors.\n\nDoes that make sense? I hope I was not contradicting... but then again, I usually do when it comes to things like this...\n\nAnyway, that is what I wanted to share. I hope that, if you read this, you will be able to better understand me and why I do the things I do. I also hope you will comes to forgive me for being so awkward, both in-person and over the phone. ...I am slowly learning how to be less socially inept.\n\nAgain... please do not hate me. Do not look down on me too much. I will do my best so I will not make you guys too uncomfortable. \n\nThank you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Just some quick tips:\n\nDetail is good. Rambling is bad. I understand that it is difficult to articulate these feelings, but it is kind of hard to follow. I feel like some of it only registered because I was SM so I know the feelings. \n\nNo need for a build up or apology. Jump right to it. Cut the long, vague intro. Conciseness is key. \"Hey guys. You are some of my closest friends and I feel it is important to share things with each other. I have never mentioned it before because I am (embarrassed, ashamed, afraid, etc.), but I have a condition called SM. (Proceed with a basic description). \n\nYou lost me with all of the quotes at the bottom. A few are great because that sheds some light on your experience. Save the rest for further conversation. Again, keep it brief. It will be more impactful that way. \n\nDefinitely keep the parts explaining how SM relates to some of the perceivably \"odd\" behaviors around them. It gives them context. That is good. \n\nKeep the part about wanting them to be the ones you open up to. It makes it personal and transparent. \n\nBiggest thing, just read through it, cut out some of the fluff. Make it brief. I think you will find that you can say just as much without overwhelming them with so much to read. Not that they will not read it, but it is a lot to take in as it is. Give them the essentials and let them process. Encourage them to ask questions. You are opening that door, now and open dialogue about your SM is the next step. Own it and express your thoughts in conversation with the people closest to you. It is liberating. \n\nI am proud of you for making this huge step. I know it has to be anxiety-inducing. Let us know how it goes! Thank you so much for this !! I am definitely going to follow your tips :) I thought it was a little long, but never really realized I was doing too much. I do not want to overwhelm them, so I will be cutting it down just as you said.\n\nIf there is anything post-worthy, I will update their response :) Again, thank you so much. Absolutely! I hope that did not come across as overly critical. Like I said, I respect that you are taking that step. Good luck! Oh, no, do not worry! I really appreciate the tips !! I have been trying on my own to fix my message, but there is only so much I could do. I really needed an outsider's thoughts and yours are perfect :) I just want to say...You are SO brave, and I hope your friends see how much of your heart went into this. I hope they will take well to it and be even better friends. I have to admit, I got a bit teary-eyed reading...\n\nAlso....the people who have said that other stuff to you...Forgive me for my language, but holy shit. There is a serious lack of empathy there. Not just lack of understanding, but also emapthy. If anyone is intentionally trying to shame you for your SM, they are toxic. Take care of yourself first and foremost. If there is a way to go \"gray rock\" with the toxic people, I hope you can do it. You deserve SO much better!\n\nWishing you so much luck!!! I agree with what has already been said as far as tips for what you have written, so I do not really feel a need to go over that again. But I want to wish you luck. I grew up with undiagnosed SM, and I was lucky that my mother was pretty supportive, but I 100% relate to the negative experiences you have had with some people, and I know how hard that is. I was tortured by teachers, classmates, and family members because of it. It makes me sad that people who know your diagnosis give you a particularly hard time. I always thought that perhaps if I would had a diagnosis, people would have been more understanding, but I guess some people are going to be toxic regardless. It is so difficult as a minor, because you do not have as much control over who is in your life, but once you are able, I strongly recommend distancing yourself from these toxic people. I am 26 now and still struggle with SM some (not nearly as badly as I used to), and at this point in my life, if people are toxic, they are either out of my life, or with my family, I just live far away from them all, so I talk to them and see them occasionally, but I have a lot of control over when and for how long. It has done wonders for my mental health. Good luck. It is a tough thing to deal with, but you are clearly strong and brave. I do not think you need to apologize so much. In fact, I do not think you need to apologize at all. As someone who sent a different version of this same message to my friends several years ago, I understand how terrifying it can be to send this. But I can almost guarantee that your friends will not change how they feel about you after learning this, and will actually be grateful that you told them, because it means they can better support you now in whatever way you need. I was surprised when my friends said they wished I would told them sooner because it meant they knew how to help me now when I needed it. Remember that these people like you and want to help you! You are brave for doing this, and telling the people close to you will make your relationship with them better and your personal struggle a little easier to bear \u2013 at least, that was my experience! This. Good friends are incredibly supportive. Voicing your struggles will help them understand how to better support you. You do not owe anyone an apology for something you cannot control. You will be surprised at how much your confidence can increase just by owning your SM instead of apologizing for it.", "relationships how have you managed to have a relationship? i am almost 25, have not even had my first kiss yet and i feel so lonely and i crave affection/attention at times. it feels like i will never be loved because the mutism, among a few other issues(anxiety,depression,self esteem,i feel like my personality is boring). my anxiety around the opposite sex does not help either. i just want to feel love. I think finding someone else who understands what it is like to be you is the key. How to do that well \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb\nI got lucky tbh. That is all. \nI do not believe some people will never get their lucky chance. You just have to keep looking. I am in the same boat OP, but 23. :/ There are plenty of people that care about you, even random strangers on the internet, you will always have support. Personally I would try discord servers or chat rooms to meet people because there is not much anxiety there. You will meet someone naturally so do not try to force it, just try and make new friends with anyone you can and see what it turns into :) Just to add a different perspective here: I do not want a relationship. They seem like a pain. But I wish you the best in your endeavors. I am almost 40, never been in one, never been kissed...I was told by siblings that their friends often ask \"What did I do wrong?! She does not talk to me!\" and they reply, \"Nothing! She is just socially awkward dude, it is all good!\" My siblings mean well when they tell me this, but then I feel even more awkward lol I have long accepted that I will never have anyone, but I do hope you find someone!", "My bf still does not talk to me My boyfriend has selective mutism and he still has not talked to me yet. I have known him for 5 years and just recently a year ago we came back into each other\u2019s lives and started dating this past March. I never pressure him to speak and I always remind him when he is ready he can speak to me but sometimes it still hurts that he is not comfortable enough to talk to me yet. \n\nHe speaks to his mom and his dad and his ex but that is about it. We hang out literally almost everyday and he makes noises and grunts and stuff but still has not said a word. I have asked him why he cannot yet and he says he does not know why, he says it feels like a blockage but he wants to be able to and knows it is coming soon.\n\nThe reason I am writing this is because I hate myself sometimes for getting irritated at him for not speaking to me even though I love him. I just want him to be able to speak to me when instead of typing on his phone, is there something wrong with me or am I doing something wrong? There is nothing wrong with you. It might be that he is scared something could change once he starts talking, or that it just takes him a while to trust people. I have known a friend for 8 and a half years, but I still cannot talk to her yet. Everyone is experience is different.\n\nI have been listening to a few podcasts about SM, and one way to help overcome it is by asking questions where you need to answer verbally but you get given options (do you want ___ or ___?). \n\nThings like that might not work though, since the podcast mostly focusses around children. I can give you a link to/the title of the podcast if you want, or you could research some ways to help him overcome it.\n\nAnother thing that could help is maybe suggesting/bringing up the idea of treatment with a professional if he does not get any, or trying to find a way to get medication for anxiety if he does not have any and is open to trying either of those/both of those. Just make sure that if you do, it is just a suggestion, and do not make it sound like your forcing him to or telling him to. Let him figure out what he thinks will work, as well as what he is comfortable with.\nAlso, one of the most important things to remember is to be patient. Some people might b able to progress quickly, whereas others might take years to overcome SM. \n\nAlso, this is not professional advice, this is just coming from someone who has had a very small amount of help, listened to a podcast, and has had SM for the past 3 years. Hope this helps though. There is not anything wrong with you and it does not seem like you are doing anything wrong specifically. What someone with SM needs is often very individualized, meaning due to the nature of the disorder it can be difficult to ascertain.\n\nIf it is any consolation this is very likely an indication of how important you are to him, it probably makes him anxious that he will say something weird or phrase something in a way he did not intend. And he probably hates that he cannot break through either, often the anxiety is exacerbated by feeling like you totally *should* be able to talk to someone but cannot because your brain takes off on you.\n\nThe best way, without more specific details, to encourage him is to simply react positively to any improvement or opening up. Do not put on an act necessarily but just show that you enjoy when he voices himself, either with verbal reciprocation or physical closeness as you are comfortable with.\n\nAnd do not hate yourself for getting irritated with him, it can definitely be irritating sometimes to deal with someone unable to connect effectively through verbal communication. He is probably aware of this also. It probably will not help to lay those irritations out for him, as you have probably guessed, but it is no shame to have a realistic emotional reaction, especially over someone you care a lot about. The best path forward is with lots of patience, I hope it works out for you both! I can assure you that it is 100% not personal. The fact that he is able to make noises is really great, and is a good first step to being able to speak. As someone else mentioned, it is honestly harder to speak to someone you really like because you feel more pressured to act accordingly. It seems like you have done everything you can already to be supportive, which is great. The best thing you can do is not mention his lack of speech at all. Any talk about it can add onto the pressure. Thank you for commenting and helping me out. I have mentioned it a few times about his lack of speech and he is mentioned before that it will put him backwards instead of forwards and I KNOW it is not good to mention it to him because it hurts to hear and I want to do everything I can to never make him feel pressured to talk because I love him to death and I love him even without a voice. Though sometimes my feelings get the better of me and I mention it AGAIN even though i know it is bad,,but it is been a while since i have mentioned it so that is a start. We are also going on a camping trip this week and he believes it will finally be the time to speak he says so i am hoping because I do not want to keep hurting him.  This comment made me feel better after reading it, I appreciate your input a lot because there are a lot of times I feel helpless or like I do not understand what is going on in his head but I want to be there for him because I do not care if he never talks to me as long as he is comfortable being with me. I always always try to react positively to him when he tells me about how he was able to say hi to strangers or when he went for his job interview and spoke the whole time but sometimes it takes a toll emotionally on me when I hear those things because it is like he can talk to strangers and his ex but he still cannot talk to me. I have been learning to cope with it though because he makes me happy and him talking is just a tiny tiny thing in our relationship. I also feel bad because once I was in a bad emotional state and I saw his mouth moving while talking to his mom and I started crying really bad and i know i probably made him feel guilty and I apologized profusely afterwards that I am sorry I got upset. The only time he went to a professional the man told him to speak because he cannot read so it kind of put him off from psychiatrists but he is still open to it one day he said. He tells me all the time about how he really wants to speak to me and his moms gf and his grandpa and he is working on it but it is hard especially because he does not know why it is happening. I cant imagine how it feels to be in his shoes, wanting to talk but not being able to. This seems mighty strange.\n\n* In what sense is he your BF?\n* Does he text stuff like, \"hand me the tv-remote?\"\n* Has he met your parents?\n* What Is his excuse for not talking? In the sense that all bfs are bfs. He communicates very well by typing on his phone and if we are driving or it is easier he will just gesture towards the item he is talking about and usually I can guess what he means.And yes he is met my parents and I see his parents everyday because I am over his house a lot (he is 21 and I am 24) Also there is no excuse for not talking because he has selective mutism and his brain works differently then ours when it comes to talking. It is not really about him having an \u201cexcuse,\u201d he has selective mutism. It is not a choice for us, and it can be extremely frustrating and debilitating. Our lack of speech is completely involuntary. Our brains shut down our vocal cords as a response to anxiety felt in social settings. Just be patient, and avoiding showing any kind of \u201cexpectation\u201d of speech. SM is entirely surrounded by it. It is something that takes time. It could take up to a year for me. It can help to have your goal be \u201cwhat can I do to make them feel more comfortable?\u201d rather than \u201chow can I get them to talk?\u201d Which podcast is it that you are referring to? Would love to listen to it as my daughter has SM. yes exactly!! it is not a choice and it is not about you guys having an excuse as to why you do not talk, because it is completely involuntary. It is out of your hands wether you want to talk or not and for the most part it is all anxiety because I know my bf has extreme anxiety issues especially in public but he is working on it and doing better. What I always remind my bf is that there is nothing wrong with you and do not ever call yourself not normal because you are amazing and you are capable of living a peaceful life even if you end up never speaking. I will never let him think less of himself because of SM and everyday he gets up and faces a new day i am ten times more proud of him.  I am by no means an expert on selective mutsim. I have worked with a few young students with it as an educator with mixed success.\n\nFirst off, It is ok that you get frustrated.  It is a frustrating situation, and you are allowed to have feelings.   It sounds like you are very caring and understanding and are taking it at his speed.\n\nCould he record a message to you while you are not there and work his way up to being there when you listen to it?  Could he read a passage from a book out loud, or even a short quote?   It is sort of a systematic desensitization to the fear of speaking.  This would of course be if he was comfortable trying this. Thank you for these suggestions! I can ask him later to see but I know i have asked him recently if he could record a message and send it to me and he says he just wants it to come naturally. Now i do not know if he is just pushing it aside so he does not hafta do it or if he really is working on it. Okay. So does he text stuff like, \"hand me the tv-remote?\" and \"can I have some of those fries\" and \"I am tired. I think I will crash out\"?\n\nI was diagnosed with social phobia and Avoidant pers disord, and I also was completely mute on a \"date.\" But even I can ask the guys I live with if I need to order more toothpaste for the bathrooms. oh defiantly. he talks sooo much through text it is almost like he is speaking which is nice because he is very talkative when he writes things down. if i cannot understand what he means when he is gesturing like at the store or when we are driving he will open his notes app and just write what he is thinking. I just want to say thank you so so much for this comment! I sent it to him and he for the first time in years sent me a video of him saying one word. I am so so hopeful for the future now and I am through the roof that I got to hear his voice. I have been wanting to hear this for 5 years. This makes me SOOOO happy! Sometimes people need to hear a suggestion from a neutral source, I know that is true of my significant other.   Hopefully he can work up to saying more or even being with you while you listen to it. For me personally in certain situations I actually want to talk but even when I try to force myself to talk I cannot he says the same thing too. he wants to talk but he cannot. but he also covers his mouth when he is talking to his mom on the phone too, which also hurts me because he cannot even let me see his lips moving. It just bothers me because he can muster up the courage to talk to complete strangers and at drive throughs too but if I am there he makes me talk to the people or if I am around he cannot talk. It just hurts knowing that I am his other half but he cannot talk to me The covering his mouth is just probably a habit that he has. The older you get the more situations you are in where you do not want to talk but have to in order to get what you need and something as simple as ordering food can be very hard a lot of time I will rehearse what I plan on saying many times before I actually say if I am able to say it he covered his mouth because i came over to see what he was doing and shushed me away. But i understand why he does the things he does because none of it is his fault, it just still hurts from time to time.", "Becoming mute as an adult? I feel very weird because every article I have found on the internet mentions that 1. It is a childhood disorder, 2. It is situational and they are comfortable talking at home.

I want to text my manager soon to explain that I have selective mutism and I am looking for a picture with info about it to explain better. I like ( except that it is mostly about children which would be weird since I am 20.\n\nA few more details: I am 20 and started working at McDonald's a few weeks ago. I am not completely silent at work but it is obvious that there is something wrong with me. When people ask me to do things I do not really respond, I just do it. I do not make much eye contact. I only talk if someone asks me a direct question, and still not always. My responses are just a few words and so quiet they can barely be heard. Occasionally if I need something I will ask if its a short enough question, but it takes a long time to make myself do it and, often its so quiet nobody even hears it. \n\nThere is some info at that link and some pamphlets, they are mostly geared towards family, teacher, and children but some of the ones labelled parents are probably as good as you will find.    \n\nthe following titled pamphlet is probably the best:    \n&gt;Supporting Children with Selective Mutism \u2013 Advice for Parents I am a hobbyist graphic designer, and this is sprouting ideas in my head haha. \n\nIf others could use a similar graphic/have ideas for what to put on it, I would be 100% down to make something. some links that might be helpful:\n\n\n\n That is great, we could totally use more graphics to pass around! Graphics spread much more easily on social media than text does. An intro to SM graphic would be a good starting point.\n\nI particularly like the definition we use in the subreddit sidebar as well as the overview from ispeak also in the sidebar. Particular things to emphasize are the involuntary nature of SM and the fact that it affects more things than speech alone. This would be really useful! That would be cool! I think it is important to say things like \"the person\" or \"someone\" with selective mutism instead if \"the child\". Everything I see about it mostly mentions kids and implies it only affects them, which makes it uncomfortable to use as an adult. Other than to say it usually starts during childhood but still affects some adults I do not see why age needs to be specified. ( I went off of the image that you shared.

Hello fellow Redditors : )\n\nI am 17F and go to a UK college. I do not know if I definitely have selective mutism, but sometimes I just get so nervous (not even at anything in particular) and clam up, completely unable to say a word, and I cannot open up until I feel a bit better.\n\nJust yesterday, my entire college year found out that someone tested positive for Covid-19, so we all have to self-isolate for 10 days. A lot of my trauma stems from being isolated away from everyone, so of course, I feel more nervous and thus I have clammed up a bit more.\n\nI have a favourite teacher that I message whenever I have queries when I cannot talk with him face-to-face, but recently I have noticed that he is not responding to me as often, even when the message contains important information or I have asked a question that definitely warrants a response. For example, yesterday I had to miss a lesson to get a PCR test, and I asked him what I would miss - he read the message and did not respond to me at all.\n\nI have friends who talk to him quite a bit, and they say that they always get quick responses, so I cannot help but feel like I have done something wrong - I feel like if I message him anymore I will become an immense burden and just an all-round pain in the arse. \n\nHe said that I could talk to him about anything and that he would always be there for me, but my trust in him is really dwindling as I have been blanked multiple times now. I do not want to make things awkward, but I also feel that if I do not say something about how tough I am finding it, I will just continue to be blanked. I also respect that he is SUPER busy, but if my friends are getting quick responses, why do not I? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any ideas on what I could do to make things better, I would really appreciate it.", "I have started stuttering I think that as a result of SM I stutter.

I do not really care about my issues until they interfere with my hobbies or my passions. It interferes when trying to find notes, cannot hum them, I always want to  make projects with lyrics and vocals and I have big urges to sing,  my ideas are bottled up inside and will not come out, even when I know I am home alone or no one can hear me, always feels like someone is there. Anyone else like this? Hmmmmm. I am not a singer, but I make yt videos and at first it was very hard for me to speak normally. My voice was very quiet and unenergetic, even though there was no one around. It kind of sounded like I was whispering or holding back. I think it is because we are so used to being quiet that it is hard to speak or sing when we want to. It feels strange to finally let it loose because we have never done it.\n\nAfter a couple years of practice I finally got the hang of it tho, and now I sound outgoing when I film (even tho I am not). All I can say is to keep on trying and you will eventually improve. Since you are practicing alone it will be much easier without the constant fear and anxiety. I am a YouTuber too, well, I make videos for fun. I am the exact same way, boring whisper voice. But my obnoxious loud friends keep it entertaining. And I managed to make a little track of me humming a chord, getting there I have sung to a crowd of 3000+ people but I cannot have a conversation with a single one of them and I would rather not. I play guitar (and kind of play piano but I can only play basic triads). I could not manage to talk up until I was 8 or 9. I have social anxiety but I am able to talk now, although I usually do not, I only ever text people, scared to call them.  \n\n\nAnd exactly the same, I still cannot sing along or hum, even when I am home alone, or it just feels like it does not come out, or if it does, it feels like that is not my voice and something is holding it back. It usually ruins my mood, and I start to feel really insecure about it so I just gave up on it. I always thought Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star looks like she has some SM traits. ( Honestly when I am singing in the car it was weird at first since I only started to do it pretty loudly a few weeks ago...but overtime it feels less weird, plus who hears you? So you just need to get used to it. For me at least.\n\nEdit: And I have made a vlog before and I came off very awkward, it is just saved in my camera roll....so yeah, that would definitely need more practice. Check out this interview with Sigur Ros.  The entire band or at least 3/4 of them appear to suffer from selective mutism \n\n", "Is this SM? I have always had this thing where, If I do not keep something regular, it becomes extremely difficult to see/talk to someone again. I used to talk to my online friends every day on discord for YEARS, but we all drifted apart for a while. Now.. they all talk again and I have not used my microphone in 6 months and I just cannot bring myself to do it? I will join and type but I will not talk. is this SM? I was just diagnosed with autism, and I have been like this all my life. I think it could be. It is different for different people. It is hard to push through our worries about the imagined high expectations of others for our conversation. I hope you will try getting on the mike! that is exactly how it feels yeah! i hope so too because i know it is good in the long run. hard to break the cycle though I do not think you break it. You just keep fighting it, and occasionally winning. Let us know how it goes! I have that exact same thing. I have lost many of my old friends due to that. It makes me really lonely. Right now, I have only one person who I regularly text, and I am terrified of losing her.", "I was basically silent for 13 years and I still struggle with it. I originally posted this on r/Anxiety and someone showed me this subreddit. I did not know it existed and now I am glad I do. Here is my story that I posted there. I thought it would be nice to put it here. At the end I will add in how it has affected me to this day.\n\nI have had it as long as I can remember starting back when I was in an abusive foster care home. That was when I was 4. My parents said that before I was \"super talkative\" but after I just got quite. For the first year of being home with my family I only whispered to them. It took until my baby sister was born for me to talk out loud to them.\n\nWhen school started I learned to just whisper to the teachers. But before I had to make sure no peers were in earshot. I just saw school as a living hell that I had to endure everyday. If a classmate was not asking \"Why do not you talk?\" they were trying to trick me into talking or trying to make me laugh (looking back I appreciate but at the time I hated). I would always want to join in on their conversations and they would try and get me to; I would even have a whole response drafted in my head of to what to say but there would be almost like a dam blocking the words from coming out of my mouth. Sometimes I would write it down on paper and give it to them and sometimes I would try to \"show\" it. It would always upset me when they misinterpreted what I was trying to say and then they would run with it. I would be so frustrated because it is not what I meant. When my parents would pick me up from school, I would not open my mouth until the car doors were shut and the windows were up; I was that terrified of someone hearing me.\n\nFrom preschool to 5th grade I did not give a crap about school for obvious reasons. But in 5th grade I finally had a teacher who did not try and force me to live up to the other kids standards or try and dumb everything down for me. He set goals for me and he made sure that I met those goals, whether that was staying with me after school, taking me into a separate room if I had questions, or regularly checking with me that I was good at my desk throughout the day. He made me care about school and made the learning enjoyable for me. Back on the school track. I went from being a D student to A student within the year.After 5th grade I made sure to get everything done and do it fully.\n\nOn a side note I did have 1 true friend throughout some of this. This was in 1st grade. We became friends after she told me to call her when I got home (she gave me her number). When I did I sat there with listening to her saying \"Hello?\" for a good couple minutes and I finally got up enough courage to say \"Hi.\" I immediately hung up the phone. After that weird exchange, I then started to whisper to her and continued to do so until about 5th grade when I finally had enough trust in her to speak normally. We spent so many hours watching Disney channel and playing club penguin and making dumb YT videos (basically normal early 2000's kids stuff). We stayed best friends until about 8th grade when she went down a deep hole of depression and anxiety and so I did I and we just stopped talking. And we have not really talked much sense. The only time I can really remember was when her grandpa died I showed up for a couple minutes at his celebration of life.\n\nI was every teacher's' pet... their \\*very\\* quiet pet, lol. All my projects and essays would be used as examples. I was proud that I was able to do that. It stayed that way until 9th grade. The year started great as normal (I was already acclimated to the school because it was a Jr./Sr. high so all grades 7th-12th were there; there was no real difference between the two because it was the same building and same teachers). Anyway, I started having to miss classes to go to my therapy appointments (which were an hour away because we live in a small town). The fear of facing the teachers and my peers and having to explain (at least to the teachers) what I was going on; I started to freak out. I started asking my dad to let me stay home \"because I have an appointment later.\"\n\nBTW tail end of 8th grade was when I started seeing my therapist (I would never seen one before) and that was only because I begged my parents because I felt like no one could understand me at school. Anyway, I also started taking antidepressants in October of that year so it probably factored into this.\n\nI stopped going to school. My dad would literally drag me out of my bed. One time while my school counselor and vice principal was there he dragged me out of the car so I could go to school. I just ended up having more panic attacks because I felt like everyone was disappointed in me.\n\nA few months before this is also when I got my emotional support cat, Minnie. She went to and still goes to every single therapy appointment with me. She will either sit next to me or she will go and do something in the office until she senses I am starting to worry.\n\nAnyway, again, then some really bad family stuff happened and it just added on to the crap pie. All you need to know was my whole family had to stay at my grandma's house. I ended up missing so much school I was marked as truant and was set to appear in court. Thank god my counselor at the school knew about the state's online school and she helped me get signed up for the next year. Back on the court thing, I did not speak to the judge but my parents, my vice principal and counselor all said what was going on and that I was signed up for online school for the next year and my therapist even wrote him a letter. I remember while I was literally crying in front of him from the stress he asked my VP (she had to do it because of the state laws) \"Why on earth is she here?!\" and he sent me home.\n\nOnline school was the first time I talked to non-friend peers. It took me until freaking 10th grade to actually have a conversation with a fellow peer!!! Now I am a senior. I have done prom committee every year so far since I have been at the online school and made acquaintances with some peers. Now I work at Albertsons as a courtesy clerk and am kind of basically living on my own (in my grandma's house).\n\nWorking had increased my social interactions at least 10 folds. Now that I am working I am seeing all the time that I have lost with social interaction. I have missed out on 13 years of learning. I keep getting told things by my manager that stems from not talking for X amount of years. She understands why but it still gets to me and I understand why she has to say it. (most of the time it is me making a bad jab at sarcasm or just me trying to control something). I have had now a couple panic attacks at work. The one time I literally had tears in my eyes but did not want to stop to fully breakdown until my shift was over with which was about 3 hours. I was mildly... crying... in... those... 3... freaking... hours. THE WHOLE TIME!\n\nI have now seen the same therapist for almost 4 years now. I have not been able to talk to anyone from my old school yet but hope to eventually and hopefully I get up enough nerve to message my friend. In school I am kind of falling behind because of procrastination and just senioritis; it is freaking exhausting. I am working with my online school counselor to stay on track but it is still hard. I am only half a credit behind on what I missed from Freshman year which I will make up next semester.\n\nBesides what I already wrote before, here is what else I struggle with. I struggle to figure out when people are joking or being sarcastic. I make jokes at bad times. I have a hard time not apologizing for every little thing. I struggle to tell someone that I relate to their story and often times feel awkward because all I can say is \"Oh no\" or \"I am sorry.\" It really does frustrate me. My therapist as helped me recognize that it is not my fault and that I am learning just like any other kid would be. I do feel terrible when I cannot pick up on this stuff faster especially since I thought had it all down from just observing people all these years. I guess practice makes perfect? I went 1 full year. Not nearly as much as you have gone. But, what i learned is its not a curse to talk little, you have likely gained some social moral compasses that others do not realize they lack. You know how to be considerate in a way. Yes, tou are probably awkward at times. But, i have always felt awkward, society is awkward.  If you are interested in a friend/chat buddy at all you can dm me on here and i will give you my messenger.  I am not judgemental about your religious, political views, your race or appearance or wealth or anything really.  I think its always just good to have people.  I keep my circle very few and really do not let many people in because most people have tried to hurt me in some way. I also had a rough upbringing. My main release these days to keep me out of depression is comedy or religion.  I have been working up to trying to be more active in my community by attempting volunteer work, but, we will see how that goes.  Just know whatever you do for others or say for others, in good faith, is a charitable act. Dont forget to thank yourself a little. Just about everything you mentioned I can relate to. (My story is ( I am in my 30's and still struggling, but it is gotten better over the years. It is important to remind yourself that it is not your fault. It is not your fault that you cannot or could not speak. It is hard not to blame yourself when you have low self-esteem, especially if people imply that you are choosing not to talk. When I obsess over how much of a burden I was for my parents and teachers, I remind myself that I did not want to be that way. I wanted to talk, but I could not. A lot of people do not understand that, because they are able to talk whenever they want.\n\nAnd it is not your fault that you have trouble understanding other people's jokes. I still have anxiety, and when I am at meetings with multiple people at work I have trouble keeping up with what everybody's saying. It is because I did not have as much socialization experience in school as other people. I have found that when I cannot think of a reply when someone is talking to me, a smile goes a long way. You sound like you are doing all right, and that makes me happy. I think therapy does help.\n\nSide note on your experience with your manager at work. I do not know the full details, but some managers are just not nice. It might be him/her, not you. That was brave of you to tolerate 3 hours of panic attack. I have been in situations like that as well and it is grueling. I was also super talkative when I was young, I would get in trouble for it all the time. by the time I started going to school it just all stopped and I went dead silent. I was so confused. I didnt even have to guts to get up in class to sharpen my pencil, it was rough. and with the truancy thing, I know how you feel. I almost got my mom in legal trouble because I was missing class every other day. The last thing I would want is to get my mom in trouble over MY mistakes. but im doing online school now so everything is okay I guess.", "My attempt to explain and help others with SM I have had selective mutism for as long as I can remember. I did not say a word to anybody for all of elementary school. Later on, I was forced to start conversing with my peers and teachers and kind of got through it on my own. I have never had any long term therapy and I still very much feel it affecting my life on a daily basis, but I have come a long way and want to share my journey in hopes that it will help others. \n\n\nI am currently writing a book with tips and experiences that I have gone through. I will upload it to amazon kindle once I finish it. It will be available free of charge for as long as possible so I will post again when it is done. I am hoping that it will help others who have been touched by SM. \n\n\nJust wanted to see if there is anyone here! The forum seems a little lifeless! :)  I am autistic, and for me it comes with severe social anxiety and selective mutism. I am also Deaf, and my preferred method of communication is ASL. I can only speak in front of my immediate family. In situations where I have to talk to others, they speak for me. ", "Any advice for school/ work environment? my school knows about my selective mutism but a lot of teachers still try talking to me or asking me to read something out, etc. I feel pathetic just standing there not saying anything whilst i can feel everyone is eyes on me probably thinking what a weirdo. Some people who are kind enough to try talk to me always have this offended look when i just nod to them i feel really bad and rude. That is always how I felt but it is not that I could do anything else. In certain situtations I could get a word out when someone asked me to say 'something,' I would then say 'something.' I was once offered $500 by the rich kid (which I am sure he actually had that money to pay me)...but first I do not want to take his money, so I did not say anything, otherwise I might have. \n\nI could usually talk to other kids in my grade in certain situations, but in the classroom setting I was silent. With friends I could say some things, but besides that no. I could talk to the teachers in certain years/classes to ask to go to the bathroom or nurse......if I had to take a shit, and one time when I shit my pants....7th grade....... :I......\n\nYeah....anyhow, in main they do not get it. For students, they never got to me or the teachers did not get to me, but.......there was this one kid. We were in some Economy elective and everyone was passing around this chip bag that was empty, and I join in and put it on this kid's desk by me....he then goes something like 'do not do that shit again..' He could have asked me politely and I would have left him alone. That is who I deemed the assholes, otherwise idk shit just never got to me.\n\nIn a perfect world, I would take my modern mindset and go back to the beginning of 6th grade. I think I would be ready.", "21, no social skills. Unsupportive narcissistic parents, no friends, broken family. I do not trust my parents at all. They have created a broken family. Always yelled at me for not being able to talk. I clearly had this problem when i was starting up in school but the problem was never addressed. Never grew out of it. Any friends I made I slowly pushed them away because I do not like to share info about my family because I would be too embarrassed to talk about what goes on in my family. Never formed a close bond with any person in my life including family. Cannot get myself to go on dates to girls even if they agree. Feel like im slowly improving but no enough. Need advice on what to do. Please find a therapist to help you\nYou are young, and have a lot of life ahead of you\nYou can make it get better You should find a therapist who will help you open up more. And my dms are open if you want to talk Best advice is \n\n1. find a job you can do \\ \n\n2. figure out a budget adn find a safe place to live. move out of your parents, and set boundaries with the help of a therapist or someone you trust so they will stop harming you.\n\n  3. find a psychologist that specializes in childhood abuse/cptsd \\\n\n4. focus on yourself. if you decide to focus a little on other people dont focus on dating at all. make friends first. get a community, a group of friends who share a similar hobby and are supportive of you. when you have gotten your life together more and you are in a safer place both mentally adn physically in life ,then you can look at dating. \\ Do not let your parents be involved in your mental health at all. I have seen therapists and psychiatrists that my parents paid for that were assholes and near traumatized me. Actually, I would think about our sessions and get angry and not be able to concentrate for a while after I stopped seeing them, so it kind of did disrupt my daily life for a while after I stopped seeing them (the way trauma does). I encourage you to seek a supportive therapist, but please keep your parents out of it.\n\nI grew up with abusive parents too and unable to talk. Understanding trauma rather than anxiety has made all the difference for me personally.  I wrote more about it ( I encourage you to learn all you can about SM and listen to others sufferer's stories. But since you grew up in a dysfunctional home, there might also be trauma. I read recently about a case of a girl that was functionally mute in a famous book about trauma (called the body keeps the score), where they claimed the girls silence was a consequence of traumatic events early in her life. I am beginning to understand my own silence as a consequence of the dysfunction and abuse I experienced too. For me, fearing people, fearing saying the wrong thing, was directly tied to my abuser's volatile personalities. Finding the confidence, self-esteem and self-compassion I needed to start taking control over my life was a matter of addressing wounds related to abuse. Me again, I noticed another user, who I think is a therapist, encouraged you to leave home as soon as possible. I wanted to share my experiences with \"leaving abuse\". I left my historically abusive parent's home some years ago to never really find the \"safe space\" I was promised. I had a string of awful experiences with roommates and landlords while supporting myself on a meager salary from a stressful job with difficult bosses and co-workers. Poverty can be just as oppressive as a dysfunctional family.\n\nThis is just my two cents, but I encourage you to find your footing in regard to your mental health first, before you attempt to leave home.  I am currently back at my parent's home after going \"no contact from the narcissists\" a while back. My mental health actually plummeted after I left. My family chased me down, would show up to my work, and messed with my relationships with landlords.  The job I had involved a lot of direct contact with people and my daily stress was sky-high, I even went mute a couple of times, after years of being ok. I was missing a lot of life skills because my parents were extremely uninvolved, so basic self-care (cooking healthy food mainly) was hard and added to my daily sense of impending doom and sense that I was a loser.\n\nI would honestly encourage you to find your footing at home first. Cut ties with your family emotionally, think of them as mean roommates, and work on yourself while you take your time in finding a decent job, working on your education, and all the things you realistically need to be able to survive out in the \"real world\" on your own. Again, just my two cents. The book Coping with critical, demanding, and dysfunctional parents provides some tips on how to make the best out of a very strained relationship with your parents. It claims to be able to provide a guide for how to finally get the relationship you always wanted, which does not appeal to me personally (like I said, I cut ties emotionally) but it can help you figure out how to build a more amiable relationship while you figure out what you want/need to do. The book's author also has a great online ( I also recommend The Body Keeps the Score, to help you understand your upbringing and the consequences of that on your mental health and ability to develop healthy relationships.\n\nWhen I left, I landed in a situation where my work sucked, my social life and mental health were killing me, and I did not have the time, money, or opportunities to build a better future. I feel as if I am building a better future for myself now that I am back at home.  I work on my self and my education and my life has gotten better, even if my family members have not changed. Ill try. I have been improving a little. Im optimistic for the future though. Thanks for the advice. I never thought I have suffered from abuse or trauma until recently. starting to realize how messed up my situation is. I thought I was just born with anxiety and stuff but starting to realize it is more about how my parents have treated me. Yeah I agree I do not want to move out until I can afford to. I have a job but its a temporary type of deal. I feel mentally great for the circumstances Im under and I believe the worst parts of my life are over. I basically have cut any emotional ties with my parents and have no will to gain connection with them. I just want to leave and not be around them as much as possible and try not to make a big deal about it.", "Anyone knows or is someone with complete mutism but known to talk during sleep?  What is complete mutism? If it is selective mutism it is not typically \"complete\"... Sorry. I meant someone who is not selectively mute in front of school, but always. In German, it is called \"total mutism\". I have never heard of it... The term you are probably looking for is progressive mutism. I do not know any cases of this personally, so this is pure speculation, but I imagine someone who is completely mute might be able to speak in their sleep. SM is caused by severe anxiety, and your brain essentially puts up a guard and you go involuntarily mute. If you are fully asleep, you are not going to be able to do that, so speech would probably be possible. Yes!! Thank you, that was what I was looking for. Very interesting.\n\nCould you also tell me, even if briefly, how your recovery process was, if it is not too personal a question? As in how fast did it come (over night?), how many months (years?) did you need to talk again, what was the reason and what helped you the most?\n\nI apologize if that is too personal. I have had a trauma-filled childhood and am very open about stuff. But you should know that I am writing a novel about a few people including a young girl whose brother developes mutism. If that is too calculated for you, I understand. Definitely not overnight. I might even say that is impossible. It is a pretty long process, and takes a lot of effort and motivation. It is usually approached with exposure therapy, which can be a little daunting. I made multiple attempts at recovery, but I was not consistent enough with keeping up with it because of how hard it was. Eventually I became extremely depressed due to being unable to speak. I could not go to school, and I could not leave the house. With the help of my mom, I decided to go our local McDonalds directly before closing hours each day and would try to verbally order. At first I would make an attempt at speaking, and no sound came out at all. I had to whisper in my moms ear. With time, my anxiety level decreased and my volume was able to get louder. Even a small mumble was huge for me. At the same time, I began horseback riding which increased my confidence by a huge amount. I would say it took maybe half a year for me to become fully verbal? A year later, I still ride (love it) and have made a few friends at my barn. I am much happier now, but I do still struggle with residual social anxiety and shyness. I was also fortunate enough to have been able to go to a treatment center that specializes in selective mutism. There is not a lot of therapists that do.\n\nHope my story helps you :D sorry it got a little long. Thank you so much. The longer the better!! Aw man. Even though I did not suffer from that vicious shit, social anxiety I know well. Has this isolating effect on you, where everyone is there to judge, to potentially fuck your life up, and of course you are convinced they are right to do so because no doubt you just messed up somehow. Oof. I am so glad your mom was supportive and you had the iron will to fuck that shit.\n\nPotential trigger warning of your past: How long did it take for you to get mutism tho? Was it an event that triggered it? Did it just happen with you suffering from social anxiety and kind of going down that \"better if I do not speak at all\" spirale? Do you know if it is possible to get mutism over night?\n\nAlso wish you the best route still. Keep riding that lane, hah. :b I am also not over the mountain entirely especially with anxiety and OCPD and shit but the bad thing about life is that it keeps moving, and the good thing about life is that it keeps moving. Wish you the best. :) I was born with it. Many SMers are. I was described as \u201cpainfully shy\u201d when I was in preschool as I never spoke, and bullying because of my mutism in middle school worsened it. Some misconceptions here: SM is never a choice. People with SM do not choose to not speak, nor does it start out that way. It is also not caused by trauma. It is considered a social anxiety disorder. While many people go mute because of trauma and it may show similar symptoms of SM, it is not considered to be selective mutism. There is not many studies on mutism, but it is suggested to be \u201ctraumatic mutism\u201d instead. I understand. I was not calling it a choice per se, just in the sense how social anxiety often happens. Thanks for clearing the differences up. Lack of studies sucks but the differentiation is something I am going to research. I will leave you alone now. Thanks so much!!!! Oh, I actually think I had \"progressive mutism\". What happened to me was it got worse and worse over years, til I barely spoke at all. But I was never totally mute. It just progressively got worse over a long time.\n\nEven thorugh the worst of it, when I barely felt human, more like a wild animal, there were times where I occasionally said something out loud accidentally, sang part of a song to myself without meaning to, and things of that nature. But I rarely got caught off guard. It would have been near impossible to do so. I was always hyper aware of cues that meant I might have to talk. I would be tense all day and especially in situations like being in a cafeteria, a social gathering (although I was mostly a shut in), or a classroom. I would be hyper alert for signs I might be prompted to talk and this anxiety that never really left my body was what made me go mute.\n\nBut I was overall seen as a weirdo and not \"mute\". At least that is how I thought others saw me.", "Just so angry My mom has been talked that I do not talk since I was a toddler by EVERYONE. Pretty much every single person that has met me. I remember every single parent teacher conference in elementary school being abt the same exact thing. I understand now at almost 20yr that I am a selective mute but a part of me so genuinely mad that he repeatively brushed over this and never got me tested for anything. Even as a 20yr who still struggles with this she just does not acknowledge that all those concerns from different ppl could have been legit I think she does not want anything to be \"wrong\" with me. I am sorry, I know how moms can be like this and it is a very invalidating and upsetting feeling. Not fair for you. I am sorry. I feel exactly the same as you. Last year my mom told me about how every teacher I ever had always told her at conferences that something was wrong, I never talked and I needed help. And she would just say well she is fine at home. I used to sit alone at lunch every day and come home and cry at night. She did nothing for me. I am so angry about this. I just know my life would have been so much easier if my mom had listened to my teachers and gotten me help. The only thing I am happy about is I can do the exact opposite for my kids. I ask my daughter every day how her day went and who she sat with.", "I could not speak sometimes- an account of having situational mutism from an adult's perspective ", "How do I shatter my reputation of being \u201cthe quiet kid\u201d I am in 9th grade and throughout my entire time in school I have been completely silent.\n\nI literally only have like 4 friends and none of them are close. \n\nThroughout the last year since I was diagnosed with SM i have been trying to speak up more but I find it difficult because everyone knows each other well and I just  feel like an outsider. If anyone has had a similar experience and could me some advice I would really appreciate it. Thx I know how you feel, I am in that situation right now with college, and I was like that throughout most of school too. \nWhat helped with me was one of my closest friends entering high school with me. Through him I was able to meet other people and be comfortable talking because he was there. Not sure if that info can help you in any way, but that was my experience. Do not attempt to. Practice dealing with your fears in a meditative way and do nothing about them. It should be really uncomfortable, but lead slowly towards acceptance of your current situation.\n\nYou cannot manage other people's thoughts, reactions, opinions, etc. You can only change the way you view yourself. Practice giving yourself a chance. Self validate how hard it can be to come out of your shell and how you still have worth even though you struggle socially. If you want a different social life, adopt different habits, but be patient with yourself and do not go to extremes or you might find it so uncomfortable that it makes you revert back to avoidance.  Plan small steps that you accomplish frequently. I always found that bringing in cookies was a good way to get people to talk to me more. Still was a quiet kid, but being able to say \"you are welcome\" to everybody who said \"thank you\" was a good start. What I would suggest is trying different peer groups - join a band or city league sports team. Anything where the context is different and they do not know you. Then you can explore opening yourself up. Even a cooking class with a family member (if you are comfortable speaking to them). A place where you can hear your own voice. \n\nAdditionally, in these situations, the point is not so much talking, it is about doing \"the thing\" - the activity.  You will get breaks from speaking. \n\nThere is a technique called Fading that is very useful with SM.  (You may have to ask a friend for help.) Basically start a conversation with one of your close buddies and invite an outsider to join you. Overtime, as you have these types of conversations between the three of you, ask your buddy to (basically) ghost you, leaving you and the other person alone to speak. \n\nFinally, be easy on yourself. You have spent years being put into a box - \"the kid who does not talk\" box. It will not take you the same amount of time to get out of that box as it took to put you in it, but it will take time.  Celebrate even the small steps, because they really do add up. \n\nHope this helps.  Good luck! I would like to say that 4 friends is a lot!  It might not feel like it now, but I am an adult and I have maybe 2-3 close friends right now that I speak to with any regularity.  Why not try to get closer to some of your existing friends if you feel more comfortable doing that?  I also was the \"quiet kid\" although I did not have selective mutism and what helped me the most was to realize that many of those kids who act like they know each other well - they actually do not.  The ones who act confident - they often are not.  They just act like they are.  For a little bit, what helped me was trying to talk to someone/people that I was especially motivated to talk to and acting confident, even though I did not feel like it.  Another thing that helped was bringing a friend with me that I felt safe with when I went into a new setting.  It still helps actually.  It is like bringing a bit of safety with you. :)  Be gentle on yourself and take baby steps in the direction you want to go in, and realize that no one, not even adults, have it 100% figured out and we are all doing okay. :) I remember how this felt. I am 22 now and still have issues with SM sometimes, but for the most part I have overcome it. I know it is awful and awkward and exhausting, but I just started slowly making small comments around people. Do not get me wrong, some places I was known as the quiet kid from kindergarten all the way to age 18 and then I moved away. But in some of my classes, I would be sitting next to some people listening to them converse and if I had the opportunity I would just try to seem as friendly as possible and inject a small thing. Like, if they start talking about a movie or show I would seen, I would saw \u201coh, I have seen that!\u201d and TYPICALLY that would open the conversation to me as well. Trust me when I say that most of the time people WILL include you in the conversation. I know kids can be judgy sometimes but I found that they really were not all that bad once I put forth the effort. It is pretty hard to break through and I remember spending most of my time absolutely stressed and sweating and waiting for the exact right moment to say like 3 words. But it worked out for me. People may be surprised at first that you spoke to them but they will very quickly even forget that you were \u201cthe quiet kid\u201d", "Selective mutism Hi, so I just saw a TikTok about selective mutism and I am not sure if it applies to me. \n\nSometimes when I get overwhelmed or very upset I cannot really speak. I feels a little like I get into flight mode or i am not able to articulate or form words and sentences. But I do not know if this is selective mutism, because even though I do not want do talk I do not go completely silent. (Not sure If this is relevant but I have ADHD).", "I am getting married in 2 weeks So i (27m) have never been diagnosed as selectively mute but i am fairly sure i have it. There have been times when i was directly asked a question and i would physically try to answer but my vocal cords just would not work. This has happened to me a few times but never often enough that I bothered with getting diagnosed.\n\nI thought it was a rare thing for me, however, recently I have realized that i might be mute way more often than just once in a while. Bc in class i would want to add to the conversation bc it is usually a part of the grade and I would start to speak or raise my hand to speak but i would be hit with a sudden wave of really bad anxiety which would stop me. This happens multiple times a week. \n\nOr I will have something that is personal or emotion I will want to say to like my significant other (27m) and I will just never be able to. I cannot get myself to say it.\n\nThose instances never felt like SM to me bc they were not nearly as extreme as the times i mentioned in my 1st paragraph. All of this is to say I am very afraid i will not be able to say my vows out loud.\n\nI and my significant other are not saying them in front of other people, it will be just me and him, which is at my request. (Which he was totally fine with) but i still struggle to say emotional things even when it is just him and me.\n\nI am 100% sure he will be understanding but I am still worried about it. It is my vows, I would like to read them outloud myself. \n\nI am at a lost i do not know what to do. \n\n(Sorry for typos. I am very dyslexic/dysgraphic.) I would tell him your concerns, and perhaps have your vows written out on a card and hand them to him just before you read them. Then if you do have trouble getting them out, you can still communicate what you want to say, sometimes just having a back-up takes the pressure off enough to make speaking easier. It can also be kept as a memento of the day. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful wedding day. Its not your vocal cords, not working. It is your brain, not giving impulses to your vocal cords. Yeah i know, you are right. I should tell him about it. It is just another thing that i have struggle to get out. I have been working up to it for a while now. He is even seen me get too emotional to say things before so none of this should be a surprise to him,  but that still somehow does not make it any easier. \n\nAnd thank you! Oh. Idk why that didnt occur to me before now, but that makes more sense Can you practice with a friend? Or even your SO? I actually tired practicing by myself and only 2 lines in it felt like my throat closed up. \n\nI did manage to ask my SO if that if he ended up needing to read my vows, if that would be okay. And, he said it would be. So i at least have that now.", "I know it gets better I just want to know How to talk to people? I (20M) really want to talk and connect with people. I know a lot of people and I am known by a lot of people the thing is I would be people's present and not utter a single word. After multiple failed therapy sessions I finally had realization (Breakthrough I prefer to call it). I inherited this (Trait) from my maternal grandfather. He does not talk unless he is drunk, he has never had a job. He does not talk when he is with people unless he is agreeing and he always agrees. My younger sister is like this also. My family and i at home we do not talk (I do not know why). Literary do not talk unless there is an outsider (Uncle, someone from church, neighbor or something) and I think us not talking at home has a negative impact on our social lives. My Mom goes to church and theres this guy my age, he always try to get me to go to church with him but I do not because I know I have to get up in church and preach. ofwhich when I used to go to church i would be the only one to say nothing. Now I want to go and speak yes i am not well educated on the word of the bible but I have since realised you do not have to say much but you just have to say something that you feel like saying.

THANK YOU", "Confused Alright for context I am not self-diagnosing myself in any way, nor am I asking anyone else to. If you want to pick out signs and stuff that is fine though.   \n\n\nI believe I might have recently developed some form of SM but I do not know if that is right since I have mainly heard of people having it when they are little. I have pretty bad but sadly undiagnosed social anxiety. I have \"freezes\" which are moments where I cannot speak, move, or do anything only try my best not to cry or hope for the situation to be forgotten. It typically happens with my teachers and parents not so much with other people my age. This started around a month ago and I fear it might get worse. It only happens in stressful situations, or when i am feeling uncomfortable. First it started as me not wanting to speak, to being too scared to speak. When I am able to get a word out in those situations it is literally one word sentences that make me sound like a toddler. Please leave any advice in the comments I do not know what to do. Hmm. I am no professional but that definitely sounds like some type of anxiety. I would not be so bold as saying you have SM specifically, but what you are describing is sort of similar to what people with SM experience. My advice would be to talk to a counselor, doctor, therapist, or other professional if you are concerned this problem is indeed getting worse so you can treat it as early as possible. Hang in there! :)", "Just come out of an episode today.. I have suffered with SM since I was a child and was diagnosed at 15 (33 now) I have had minimal support and help with this even though it affects me so often. Mostly I will have situational SM but when it is a triggering time or something happens with my mental health I will stop talking completely and length of time varies.\n\nI have just come out of a 10 day episode due to it being a very triggering time of year. I still cannot get used to the feeling, strength it takes to talk. It feels like my voice is so jumpy with my words and I feel like I am shouting even though I am not. It takes so much energy to talk. It makes me want to stop talking again but even if I tried I could not just stop talking (weird how the brain works) \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what I can do to help with my vocal cords after an episode? Has anybody had any kind of speech therapy before? I am so sick of fighting this with everything else and if I can make atleast 1 aspect of this better I will try anything..\n\nThanks for listening \u2764", "Is this SM? I would just like some opinions from people before I bring this up to my psychologist next time I talk to him.\nI have always had issues being able to speak but only when I am upset or anxious; for example, sometimes when I want to ask my parents a question or tell them about something, if it is a conversation I have not had before it can take me a long time (sometimes hours) to be able to speak to them. Or when I am upset/crying and my parents ask what the problem is I find it easier to not answer. I generally do not have trouble communicating in normal situations, but I am not good at initiating conversation, and I tend to prefer to speak through text when possible.\nLately I have been having issues at work. I work in a call centre that does a form of caption calling for deaf people, that often involves us reading out messages from a deaf user and transcribing what the hearing person is saying in response. We are a government service but not well advertised, so we have this explanation of our service we have to read out at the start of every call. A lot of people hear it and assume we are telemarketers or something and hang up on us, or try to get into arguments instead of listening. Personally I have only had a few instances of voice callers being difficult, but sitting in the office I hear plenty of other workers trying to explain our service to people who clearly just want to hang up on us, and it is making me really scared of making calls, to the point (and obviously I know this is bad of me) I have to disconnect users if they are trying to call a number I do not already know will take our calls, since I freeze up and know I will not be able to speak to the person on the other end. I feel really bad about it but I do not know what else to do, and I am embarrassed I got myself into a job like this when I knew already I have trouble speaking sometimes.\nSorry if I went on a bit of a tangent there, but does this sound like selective mutism? I guess I am confused because it seems like all of the examples are people saying \"I cannot talk to adults\" or \"I cannot talk at school\", which are not things that have ever really applied to me. You ask your Dr. But it sounds more like anxiety and garden variety shyness. It does sound like anxiety maybe even verging on phobia, but does not seem to meet the criteria for selective mutism. Selective mutism is not the only condition that causes difficulty with speaking though. \n\nPlease get yourself some help. You are doing an important and worthwhile job. Even if you switch jobs, it seems like you have anxiety severe enough to be affecting your life. You could really benefit from something like CBT. \n\nIn the meantime remember, if someone is a jerk to you, that is not your fault! That is on them! \n\nYou might also find one of these workbooks helpful if treatment is hard to access: ( Particularly social anxiety, panic, tolerating distress and assertiveness. \n\nBest of luck! It sounds like social anxiety to me, not SM. No harm in bringing it up to your doctor, though. Just be warned, your doctor probably has never heard of SM.", "My experience with selective mutism (sry my bad english\ud83d\ude05) yo guys im new here im 17yo i just discovered i have SM the first of this month so i lived with it like 5 years noone really knew that was something wrong with me i was just the guy often talk i basically run away from certain situations and try not to be noticed. I started to think last summer why i was doing that and i searched for a while my problem first i doubted that i had aphasia/dysphagia then i went to a psychiatrist he literally didnt change nothing cz i spoke ( eh i can say normally because i chosed the easiest words i can say and sometimes replies only by yes; ehmm ; i understand) i could not say what i wanted to say because i just could not spell the words out at that moment its like an impossible task to do. i never had close friends anyone to talk to and my biggest fears were talking on the phone;ordering something and speaking in class so i think i after i knew what is the cause i will start from now or WE must treat it nothing can stop you its all about controlling that part of the brain who stops when you wants to talk cz \"it feels danger\" there is nothing to fear we are stronger than we think DONT CARE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK it makes it worse i feel like i will someday (OR SOON) change and be overcome this \"phobia\" and be SO FREE (again SO SRY for my bad english hope its at least readable and another thing no one knows i have sm even my parents should i tell them? I feel like i can overcome it by myself and thanks)", "Some questions about selective mutism Hi, I really want to write a character who has selective mutism in my stories so I will ask a few questions\n\n1. Is using sign language/ writing easier than talking? \n2. When you are in a situation where you cannot talk, does that extend to sign language or writing things down?\n3. Assuming the above fails, do you also lose the ability to draw to communicate?\n4. When you are not conversing with people, are there certain situations where you cannot write anything in the same way as not speaking?\n5. Can you talk aloud to yourself with ease?\n6. Is the kind of anxiety that stops you from talking the same kind of fear that you see when something bad is about to happen? Or is currently happening? \n7. Say, there was a stove fire or something. You are the only one in the kitchen, you just walked in. Assuming your family are people you are comfortable talking with, do you start shouting for them or will you bang pots and pans because the fear made you mute again?\n8. How do you signal to someone that you are mute? Pointing to your throat etc\n9. Do you handle confrontation well? \n\nThese are just questions off the top of my head. You do not have to answer all of them of course, just write a number that you would like to answer and then your response. Thank you so much in advance! 1. Writing is definitely easier than talking, but there are some people (mostly adults) with whom I feel too uncomfortable and anxious sharing my thoughts with and can only give short responses to. I can write freely to friends and people I am comfortable with. Sign language is not easier for me because I have social anxiety, so signing with everyone looking at me would make me very self-conscious and worried that I look stupid.\n\n2. I only write when I cannot talk. But that is only if I absolutely have to communicate. I usually just avoid social situations at all costs.\n\n3. I can draw to communicate if it comes to it, but I do not normally do that.\n\n4. No, if I am not conversing with people, my writing ability is fine and I am free to write whatever I want.\n\n5. I can whisper to myself, but not talk out loud. It might be different for other people though.\n\n6. I do not know honestly. I have had selective mutism and anxiety all my life, so I do not know what it is like to be able to talk whenever you want to without all the fear. Whenever I am expected to talk, I just freeze up and am unable to say a word. I do not know why. Maybe I am just so afraid of what people think of me and I am afraid of saying something stupid. But like, I also WANT to talk; it is not a conscious choice I am making to stay silent. It is just\u2026 overwhelming panic is stopping me from speaking, and the only time I do not feel panic is when I am allowed to remain silent. I feel safe and at ease in my little bubble of silence. Haha, this is why selective mutism is not an easily understandable condition.\n\n7. I cannot talk to most people in my family, but if I could talk to them, I would shout for their attention. Bad things happening do not usually affect my ability to speak to people I already speak to.\n\n8. I usually do not. I just stand there frozen, face blank, or smile awkwardly, so they wonder why I am not responding and think I am rude or weird. But if I wanted them to know, I would write it down.\n\n9. If someone confronted me, I would stand there not being able to say anything even if I wanted to. Unless it is someone I feel truly comfortable enough with that I can say what is on my mind. WOW I was not expecting someone to give that detailed of a reply! Thank you!\n\nSocial anxiety sounds like hell. I am sorry you had to go through all that. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better, the people I live around at highschool/ uni are so chill you can literally butt into a conversation with something dumb like \"penis\" and literally no one cares. Saying this because one of my ex classmates did it all the time. Short of saying slurs or other stuff I know you will not say, I do not think you can upset them. ( \n\nI wonder if printing shirts saying 'I am mute' or something would be helpful to people with selective mutism? It is no problem!\n\nYeah, kind of. It is okay, thank you :)\n\nThose are some cool people, and that video was funny HAHAHA thanks, that did make me feel better.\n\nHmm yeah it might be. For me,\n1. I only know one person who knows ASL so writing/typing on my phone is more effective. But using my limited ASL is no problem.\n2. Yes, In moments of things like anxiety attacks, I freeze like a deer in headlights. Cannot do anything, sometimes I can barely nod/shake my head. \n3. I do not draw. Words are easier.\n4. Writing is unaffected. \n5. I talk to myself if I know that no one can hear me, but it is only stuff like \u201cdang\u201d or \u201coops\u201d. If people I talk to are around I tend not to out of choice. \n6. I guess? I even around friends I talk to, I am often very aware that I am not contributing to the conversation and that I should but what can I say? What if they talk over me again? What if I say something awkward? Am I making it awkward by not saying anything? This applies to writing notes to other people as well. \n7. I would not question yelling in that context. I am probably not loud enough so I would also repeat it and make sure they hear. Also, relapses in SM (personally) are only from trauma from social situations.\n8. 90% of the time, I am usually with someone else who will say it for me. Or I will type it out. Typing that out when meeting someone is awkward so it is not easy, but necessary.\n9. Nope. My knee jerk reaction is apologizing or going out my way to avoid the situation/people to make sure it will not be a problem. I have not seen people on the floor above me in years because of this. Hello. Ex-SM here. SM is very different for different people. And most of the few representations in media are awful.\n\n1. I was never taught sign.\n2. I could never write things down, I could hardly even point to things. The most I could do was often nod or shake my head. And even that was difficult. As I got older I was able to respond when spoken too, but still found it difficult to initiate conversations. Part of the reason I couldnt write things down wasnt just a fear of communication, but also a fear of looking \"wierd.\" I often found that fellow kids were very antagonistic towards me if i ever got special help. So I preferred to suffer in silence and be ignored rather than deal with other children being aggressive to me when I got help.\n3. As above, yes. Writing, drawing, gesturing. All very difficult. I could do my school work, or draw for pleasure, but if it was specifically for communication rather than general work i was unable.\n4. For me no.\n5. No, but not because of my SM. Just because some people, even those without any disorders, find doing that awkward.\n6. &amp;#x200B;\n\nThe anxiety itself is the same as when you try and jump off a high ledge. There is a primal instinct that freezes your whole body, as if its trying to protect you. However personally I was never anxious in situations other than talking. I loved 'being adventurous', I could jump of high ledges no problem, climb trees, play music in front of crowds. In was only specific communication that was anxiety inducing.\n\n7. Again, for me no. If I knew the people I was shouting at well I could deal with any situation perfectly fine. I would have fully been able to shout for my family or friends. (On the other hand, if i was surrounded by strangers and would burn in a fire If I talked, I would have been unable to shout then, not bc of the fire, but bc of the strangers) 8.\n\nI had SM until the age of 14/15. I never had to signal I was mute. They picked it up pretty quick when I did not talk. 9.\n\nNo. Even as an adult without SM i still have social anxiety, it is just managable now. Gaahhh bullying is the WORST. Totally fucks up your self esteem especially if you are a kid :(\n\nIt is so interesting how you can be afraid of things that other people would consider normal, yet be capable of doing things that normal people are afraid of. Like how I can recover from gardening shears to the leg in three days but get nauseous if I even so much as smell mince meat. Humans are weird. Thank you for sharing! #6 is so damn relatable though omg... \n\nI feel like selective mutism and social anxiety go hand in hand in many ways. I tend to get quiet when I am upset but never to the point where I am mute, so yeah Not here to answer these questions since my case is kind of different from the one you are talking about (As a kid when I was at my most severe, I could talk if I needed to, like for collaborative schoolwork, as long as the subject was not about me or my opinion. I only froze if it was a social type of thing, i.e I never made small talk with ppl, and I dared not ask the other kids to play with me. If they asked me about myself, I would reply with minimal words. They would ask me more questions and then give up on trying to get me to talk since my responses were minimal.)\n\n\nI wanted to share these other posts from this sub with you in case u have not seen them. They do not answer your questions specifically but may offer helpful additional info from our perspective:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I can answer # 9, actually. I am terrible with confrontation. I did whatever I could to avoid it, and I used to really, really hard time saying no. I actually attended a couple of social events because I was too frightened to say no, and braved them out instead. Over half the time I had a really awful time there. There was so much anxiety in my stomach and I was like a deer in headlights just waiting for the event to be over. I am gradually getting better with self work but still prefer to avoid situations where I would have to say no. The fear is that the person will hate me for saying it OH MY GOD THOSE LINKS ARE SO HELPFUL!!! So I gather that most forms of selective mutism go hand in hand! \n\nBTW I do not really care about the type of selective mutism just provided they;re answers. I am autistic so I relate to your earlier points, but I do not think I have even been in a situation where I have unwillingly been unable to speak before. \n\nAlso one thing that I do not really understand about social anxiety is the fear of being hated? Like, if they are going to hate you for doing something as small as saying 'no' to something then it is better that they hate you early on so you can cut their toxic ass out your life. But then, social anxiety seems to be worrying that \\*EVERYONE\\* will do that, so yeah that is paranoia fuel. Yea, paranoia was definitely major a part of it. I just had so much fear that I would say or do the wrong thing that I ended up paralyzed in many situations. Too much overthinking going on in my head but unable to express any of it out of fear that it would be the wrong thing. My conscious brain knew I was being ridiculous but I could not stop the fear Yeah it is like when you are a 9 year old and you are going into a dark room and you are scared shitless even though you know demons are not real lol i was not sure if you needed more answers or not but i wanted to try and step out of my comfort zone (and i like answering questions) so i thought i would do it anyways \\^\\^ for context, i am 18 years old and have had selective mutism since i was 5, but i also have ocd so my experience may be a bit different to others\n\n1. writing is easier than talking, but whether i can come up with something to write is another story because i tend to go somewhat blank mentally when i am expected to communicate. i have never learnt sign language but i would expect it would go the same way\n2. 100% yes, it extends to anything where i am expected to relay something in any way to another person on the spot\n3. i have never tried, but i expect so\n4. kind of? i have always struggled with creative writing, but i assume that is more of an ocd thing than a sm one because it is me being a perfectionist afraid of making mistakes\n5. yeah, i have always been able to and actually do it a lot \n6. not really, i have more of a physical reaction to the latter (heart racing, tense, etc) meanwhile my selective mutism is more of a mental panic and heightened emotions kind of thing\n7. i would go run to whatever room they were in, i am comfortable talking around my family but my voice is naturally soft so i know trying to yell would not be effective anyways\n8. usually it is gone one of these ways if someone asks me a question - other people mention the fact i do not talk for me, i attempt to say something that comes out in a whisper, or i just do not answer (unwillingly of course, i would if i could) and they get the hint. i do have a tendency to fidget and dart my eyes around a lot when i am struggling to talk, so i guess i look anxious/uncomfortable to others and they understand\n9. definitely not, but i have been getting more comfortable with taking a stand for my opinions over the internet recently if that counts as confrontation lol\n\nsome other things that may be of interest in terms of character writing - i tend to always have a blank expression around people i am not able to talk to, i use my hands when speaking to help others understand what i am trying to say in case they cannot hear me or my sentence is coming out jumbled, initiating conversation (especially in person) is pretty foreign to me, and i am actually a very passionate ambivert at heart who would be a talkative expressive person if not for my selective mutism\n\ni hope this was helpful in some way  :) Haha, in stimulations of fear I just shut down like I am in shock, and personally I find writing just as hard as talking because I am still communicating with them idk why, sometimes I do find that even when I am home alone I have trouble singing to myself out of fear that someone will hear me even tho nobody is there Yes it was!! Very helpful! All of them are in their own lovely little way. I love how you included that last paragraph, that is very helpful! I will keep that in mind when I write.

I know SM primarily affects children, but any feedback would be appreciated. \n\nI do not feel like I have things to say, but cannot physically gets the words out. Instead I go blank in social situations, and am physically unable to come up with anything to say. I can sputter simple responses if people ask me a simple question, but I physically cannot come up with anything to say if someone asks me an open ended question, or if they are not asking me an actual question. There is only a few select people I am comfortable with and therefore am very talkative around them\n\n I can even be acquainted with someone through mutual friends, but even after months I will not really feel comfortable around the person. They try to engage me, but eventually kind of give up since I have never actually talked to them (which is always kind of a relief). From there on out I will say hi to that person, but nothing more than that. \n\nIf I am with someone I am not comfortable and someone I am comfortable with at the same time then I go blank, and cannot contribute to any kind of conversation. \n\nThere are also times when I am in a social situation (not talking to anyone really), and will want to leave, but will not necessarily leave because I do not want to even say goodbye to everybody. The issue is just physically saying goodbye. But I feel like I cannot leave without saying bye because then I am being rude. \n\nI do not feel like I have conventional social anxiety because I do not care much about what people think of me, and I am not scared of the social situation itself. I am just not naturally comfortable around people. If I make a fool out of myself when people try to engage with me the entire situation is pretty uncomfortable (for the both of us), but I do not sit there and obsess about what I could have/should have said. I kind of just brush it off. \n\nI have gotten to the point where I have really stopped caring about this aspect of myself. This has been so engrained in who I am that it does not even bother me that I really cannot make new friends, or that I will never date/be married. \n\nThis only pertains to social situations. I can easily make small talk with certain people at work, or sometimes have a casual conversation. But anything outside of work is an issue for me.\nIf I am in a very structured situation where I know what will be discussed (like a work meeting), the I have zero issues.\n\n I even went to a writing critique group a few weeks ago and did not have issues giving  feedback to people on their writing since I knew what I wanted to say, but I struggled with the social aspect afterwords when we were done discussing each others writing Not a professional, but I do have SM. I do relate (a lot) to some of your problems, but not all of them (such as being able to talk in work situations. I think it could be fair to say you do have it   No, it is not \"fair\" to say that he has SM. This disorder can only be diagnosed by a professional, then it is not nice to simplily say that he has it, althought it seems that he can indeed have it. I did not say they have it Thank you, I appreciate the feedback. It is definitely hard to validate my suspicions, so it is good to know that someone with SM can relate. Thank you for taking the time to read my post! I think he was just tentatively saying there is a good chance I have it. But I appreciate that you pointed out I should seek professional help because there are a lot of people who look for a diagnosis on the internet. This is something I plan to do, but I think I just needed a little validation from people with SM before I take that next step.  There is only one psychologist in my area with experience with SM, but I have to apply through an insurance   exception to get coverage. Keep your fingers crossed for me \ud83d\ude01", "Thinking about talking to doctor about sm. Do not trust parents. I have not been officially diagnosed (yet). I want to talk to my doctor about it. Judging by all the symptoms and signs of sm I am the textbook definition of it. I have definitely improved a lot but not enough to function properly in society, but good enough to want to seek help from a doctor or get therapy. \n\nI am 21 have not been to the doctor since i was under 18. Never called for an appointment or anything. Kind Of lost on what to do to set up an appointment. Should I just call and setup a regular check up and then talk to the doctor and see if i have sm? \n\nI also do not trust my parents. I believe at least 1 of them is a narcissist, and they are very sneaky. (Also find it odd they never nag on me to go to the doctor now that Im over 18)Im under their insurance still and I dont know how that will effect anything. I just do not want them to know anything about my sm or whatever i get diagnosed with. I do not mind if they know about the fact that I went to the doctor or if i start receiving medicine or therapy. As long as they do not know what I have or what im on or what is being done to me. \n\nPlease give me some advice. Really starting to get out of my comfort zone with this one. best to simply call a doctor, ask if they are accepting new patients. If they say yes, then ask  to make an appointment.\n\nIf they are not accepting new patients, ask if they can recommend anyone, and they may ask a few more questions to best recommended another doctor. \n\nSome doctor offices also have online booking as well. \n\nWhen you go for your first visit, you will probably need 10 minutes before the exam to complete a few forms as a new patient. \n\nAnd lastly, you can also ask friends if they recommend a doctor. Say you are needing to set yourself up with one. \n\nGood luck. And yes, I have SM as well. For SM you might get good success from a therapist as well. I would try searching online for dcotors who specialize in or treat SM specifically, because even doctors often do not know what it is. If you cannot find any online I would ask when you call or email or whatever if that is something they can diagnose/treat. Although the first time I tried that they *still* did not know anything about it. I made it very clear what the appointment was for and specifically asked them in the email if they could diagnose SM there or if I should go somewhere else. They told me to come in, only to tell me nobody there knew about SM and I would have to go somewhere else \ud83d\ude44 huge waste of time. It worked the second place though, just make sure you get an actual answer to the question before making the appointment. If they tell you to come in, but do not actually say they can help you with SM it is because they will still get paid for the appointment. Do not waste your time/money.\n\nAlso, less related to SM, I do not think it is that weird to not go to the doctor or that your parents do not pressure you to. I am the same age as you and mine do not either. Its pretty common for adults to only go to the doctor when they really need to. I would recommend a therapist or psychiatrist. 25 years of SM, most doctors have no idea what it is or will throw pills at you. Are you in the US? I do not know how it works in other countries but I would think similarly. Doctors have to keep your information confidential. Make sure your parents are not listed as contacts, and then they should not be able to have access to details since you are an adult.", "Can SM cause this? First off, SM is new to me so idrk much. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo, usually I can talk to people face-to-face, because I think the fear of their response to me not talking overrides the fear of talking. But I CANNOT text people, call people (unless it is my parents or siblings), or talk about certain topics.\n\nMost sources I saw about SM say that people who have it usually cannot talk to superiors, people they are unfamiliar with, or oftentimes other people in general, when in uncomfortable places like school or social gatherings. This is only true for me with texting and calling.\n\nI cannot talk to my closest friends about very specific topics, even when I have been with them all night. (I only have two friends because my brain can only work with one at a time unless we are all physically together) The topics I cannot speak for are very personal, and my vocal cords shut off completely. No sound will come out unless the topic is not on my personal experience. It includes things like traumatic experiences or things that will reveal anything remotely concerning about me. If the focus is changed on the other person, then I will most likely be able to respond unless flashbacks get in the way of it. This becomes worse with my parents.\n\nI will ghost friends even though I feel sick with guilt. I do not understand, texting someone back should not be difficult. It is likely that I will ghost one friend while communicating regularly with the other, then it swaps. I sound like a real jack*** right now but I cannot explain the inner workings of it. Strangers and other family will not be responded to and it is also difficult to respond to my dad.\n\nAnd lastly, calling people. I had a major panic attack ordering pizza. I forcefully opted to order online when my friend tried to make me call to \"face my fears.\" I would have had another attack otherwise. I could barely call my boyfriend to talk to him, texting him physically hurt. He was not mean or anything. (Ex now, literally because of my communication issues)\n\nI think I have explained the basics. I have gone through abuse and neglect for a major portion of my life so there is that. I feel so guilty about literally everything. Obviously there is something more than just SM if anything, but I am slowly trying to fit puzzle pieces together here. Basically, I am TERRIFIED of people's responses.\n\nOne more thing, I am more likely to be able to talk about those topics with complete strangers. But, if the relationship goes even barely beyond surface level, then it will stop. I think this is because there is no emotional link or expectations of me as a person in that situation.\nI.E. using a throwaway account.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR : So my friends and family think I am a happy-go-lucky, coolheaded person, when in reality it is the polar opposite and I am physically incapable of telling them anything is wrong. I cannot call or text anyone and the guilt is ripping me apart. I am *absolutely terrified* of people's responses to the things I say or do. That is got to be difficult, especially in a pandemic when the world gets \"together,\" virtually!\n\nHow did you stumble upon SM? It sounds like a logical diagnosis, you go mute in select circumstances beyond your conscious level. \n\nI am not a psychologists, only fascinated with the way our brains can \"protect us\" while making us seem a little crazy. I think its the bright side of being raised in disfunction. \n\nNow to my point, I have social anxiety. It was real bad in school. Probably would not have impacted me so severely if I had not moved 50 freaking times &amp; attended 13 schools. I did weird shit, like talk at an inaudible level so people could not determine if I was stupid or not. When asked a question, I answered promptly to get the attention off of me. \n\nMy 6 year old daughter is a lot like me. BUT, she has always been super clingy &amp; did not want to get to know really close family members until the last year or so. When asked a question at school or at a birthday party, she just stares at them blankly. Does not matter how many times she is asked, she is frozen. She has Selective Mutism. Looking back, there were clear indicators from day one. \n\nSocial Anxiety produces fight or flight responses. You will knock babies over in a crowd if that is what it takes to get the hell outta there! Anxiety in general will cause you to over analyze everything you did/might do, what could go wrong, reminding you how much you suck at everything (it is a damn liar.) \n\nSM on the other hand, not only lies to you, but it forces you to keep standing on that stage even though you have stage fright and obviously are not going to be able to break it at the moment. \n\nSo hearing your story, I would bet you have anxiety, I am not sure what flavor. You might even have a couple (my daughter was diagnosed with GAD &amp; SM, thankfully GAD seemed to diminish once I learned who I need to be for her.) Do not rule out PTSD either. The sooner you get assessed, the sooner this can stop limiting you. There is exposure therapy and there is also a bunch of free resources because everyone is losing their damn minds right now! \n\nIf I can be of any help trying to line you up with those resources, or providing you info to show your folks, or anything else... DM me, or respond here. You will overcome this. Thank you so much for responding, I really appreciate it! At first I heard the term and since I was experiencing similar things, I did a little research which lead me to this sub. I figured, why sit here wondering when I can ask people who experience it firsthand ?\n\nIf there is one thing that I without a doubt have, it is some form of anxiety. Technically I am not diagnosed but I have had it since forever and it is severely effected me.\n\nI was unsure of what the limits of anxiety and SM were and where the line was drawn. So I guess that was sort of my overall question ? Your response gives a lot of insight into it and has really helped me understand. I do try to avoid people at all costs, including family, but if I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, then I will talk. Although I will not be happy about it and I may or may not have an anxiety attack. But still, nothing comes out if it is about the topics I mentioned before.\n\nI must assume that not being able to talk at all when I might really need to is just my brain hitting the panic button. Repeatedly and forcefully. I also overanalyze literally everything so you got me there. I just do not know how to get this out of the way of talking with people I should trust.\n\nI cannot doubt the thought that I may have PTSD either. I am a young adult now, it is just that I really, really do not know what I am doing when it comes to finding help. My dad believes therapy is just people selling lies to make money, so that is a thing. And my mom does not like the idea of it. And both think that medicine actually make it worse. So that is why I am a bit stuck here. I have kept to myself about it because of this. Otherwise I would (basically) be called brainwashed. \n\nThe thing is, I REALLY do not want people to know that there are things wrong with me. It is like an instinct or something. Like I am protecting them from it ? Idk.\u00a0I do not understand it.\n\nAgain, I seriously appreciate the time you took to respond. I never really spoke openly about these things before so any helping hand is more than welcome ! \ud83d\udc95 I am so happy that my response was helpful! My daughter was barely 5 when she got diagnosed and even at her young age, she was so relieved to find out that she was more than shy. To label your challenge and know that you are not alone brings a huge amount of relief!\n\nI heard what you are saying about your parents and I get it. I have had plenty of family members (who are my support system) feel similarly through our journey. It makes it more challenging, yet they may change their opinions once they notice a difference in you. They may not, and there is even a possibility that healthy boundaries need to be set with them.\n\nI also noticed that you mentioned you are a young adult, I want to confirm, you are over 18? If not, your parents opinions could delay things for you. \n\nTo look up the help that is available to you, I would need to look up what your specific state, possibly county is offering. We should probably talk about that in a DM. I want to see what is offered with no insurance, since I would guess even if you are on your parents insurance, they probably would not be helpful about it covering \"fake doctors.\"\n\nA couple other things, just because you get diagnosed with something, does not mean you HAVE TO take meds. My daughter is not on anything. There are natural routes that take more work, but it is completely doable. Also, I had really bad anxiety when my family did not support my ADHD medication management. Once I decided that it was necessary because my therapist and doctor agreed, my anxiety faded. Sometimes it will seem like we are really messed up beyond repair. Yet, there is one really big problem that needs to be addressed, once it is... Everything else will come easily. Your anxiety could be the thing that is telling you something is wrong. Or it could be the main problem. \n\nLastly, I used to keep things to myself, refused to share my past trauma and such. But once I realized that keeping it inside actually breeds more psychological issues, I realized that it is what I needed to do. Not that I talk about being molested to everyone I meet or anything crazy like that. I think we go through stuff so that we can help others later down the road. Once we get to a point of some healing, we can help empower strangers on Reddit \ud83d\ude04", "Small Improvement (but still) I have really been struggling lately and have not been able to sleep because I have been so anxious.

I do not expect myself to improve rapidly because it took me weeks to sometimes whisper at school, but I am doing better today. I think it was because I talked to my sister about and she made me feel so much better about it. I am so grateful to her. That is awesome!

How did you do it? I do not have a job or drivers license. I am just to anxious to do almost anything productive. Im about to get my 2nd. Got my first one out of complete necessity. Right now going through extreme anxiety but I feel like im better at adapting to new environments. Yes and I honestly do not know how they hired me. I did so badly on the interview. I was super quiet. I was sure I did not get the job. But I did! So I would say stay hopeful. It took me a while to find a job. Thank you that does give me hope I am glad :) I have had a few, but I got most of them through a staffing agency. All of those jobs were in a warehouse. So,I normally worked with the same people every day - which made things a bit easier. I am NOT cutout to work with customers. Yes. I do warehouse work and I do not have to interact with anyone. I take lunches by myself and I usually work in breaks. Thankfully there is someone else that seems extremely shy and the other people in my area are quite older and not really intimidating on a day to day basis.\n\nI did not do any interview as it is not possible. I got it through an agency. Full time. I am not really career material. Too many mental issues to get along with other people or work with them. I do not have a license for similar reasons.\n\nSocial anxiety and SM are big reasons for not having a career, but oppositional defiant disorder definitely hits the big check for another reason amongst others. Interviews are not that bad for me anymore, I can generally talk pretty normally if it is one on one, especially with someone who does not know about the selective mutism and is not expecting me not to talk. Phone calls are the hardest part for me, it is a lot harder than talking in person. But once I am hired and start actually working around a bunch of other people, the selective mutism becomes a lot more obvious.", "\"SM is not in itself a mental health issue \u2014 it becomes a mental health issue because a lack of simple accoms &amp; understanding early on leave us vulnerable.\"   Smells like liberalism. Agree **tl;dr: I agree with the sentiment, but disagree that SM is harmless.**\n\nI understand the social model of disability. I do not see my autism or ADHD as mental health issues. They can cause some problems, but they are complex and lifelong conditions where suffering is not necessarily inherent. It is just the way my brain is, so I have to learn to manage my life around these conditions and hope for acceptance.\n\nThe social model applies to SM as well, but the difference is that suffering in SM is inherent due to it being an anxiety related condition. In the case of SM, I certainly would have suffered less with acceptance and accommodation. But as long as I left the anxiety tied to the SM untreated, I would still be experiencing a great deal of suffering. \n\nAfter treatment, I was able to look back and see SM was a maladaptive coping mechanism that made my life more difficult in the long run. Avoidance feeds anxiety, and SM allowed my anxiety to gorge itself like a pig.\n\nThe sense of relief I felt in the short term from giving into my anxiety made me want to keep giving in. But in the long term, I lost control. I became addicted to that short term relief of avoiding socializing and speaking and it was ruining my life. It was not me giving into my anxiety anymore, it was my anxiety controlling my body like a lifeless puppet.\n\nBy giving into my urges to avoid for the sake of short term relief, I became more and more fearful. It was a truly horrific and vicious cycle. I would not wish these feelings of fear, powerlessness, and isolation I experienced on my worst enemy.\n\nI agree that acceptance and accommodation are important for SM in day-to-day life outside of a therapeutic setting, and even inside one as well. As I learned in CBT, things are not always black and white. Respecting a person and accepting their SM does not need to be mutually exclusive with treatment.\n\nI just think this idea that an anxiety disorder should not be treated and that anxiety should just be accepted is a really heartbreaking stance to take. I have seen too many people at their lowest confront their OCD and anxiety and come out stronger and less anxious to ever believe that there are people who have untreatable anxiety.\n\nI *did* suffer from SM. The lack of \"early intervention\" allowed anxiety and SM to steal 16 years of my life. Treatment is about empowering *you*, the individual, and taking control back from the anxiety.  No one can change you, you change yourself so that you can be happier and healthier.\n SM has a very high \u2018recovery\u2019 rate, recovery meaning getting to a point where you are comfortable. \nThere is a difference between accepting who you are and admitting defeat. \nI will always be anxious, I will always be quiet. I however have worked hard to have the ability to not just made verbal sounds but to communicate ideas, feelings etc.\nEven therapies like DBT that focus on accepting yourself as you are encourage you to challenge yourself to become more mentally healthy.\nMental health is no more scary than physical health.\nIf i had asthma it is a physical disorder, it in itself is a health condition. it does not mean i could not be healthy in other ways and the fact we can treat it with inhalers does not mean i should make an asthmatic person run a marathon.\n\n", "Noelle\u2019s Story Of Overcoming SM My daughter Noelle was diagnosed with Selective Mutism which is an extreme form of Social Phobia when she was a toddler. It is a disorder known for being incredibly difficult to treat and there are very few specialists available ( the United States. If improperly treated, Selective Mutism can persist into adulthood and leave a person severely disabled for their entire life.\n\nFor the first eight years of Noelle\u2019s life she only spoke with my husband and I, and two of her best girl friends. She would not speak at school. Over many yrs she worked with countless Psychologists and Therapists with little to no progress. The only specialist in this area of expertise I found was a Psychologist in Pennsylvania for $400 an hour who was treating through video chat. This would have bankrupted us! I realized as Noelle was approaching 10 yrs old that we were entering \u201cthe point of no return\u201d and this would become a permanent lifelong issue if not resolved quickly. Time was of the essence! \n\nIt was at this point I decided to take matters into my own hands. I fired the Therapist who had been working were her at our home and read a half dozen books on Selective Mutism to gain more knowledge of the condition and write up a treatment plan. I felt empowered during this time and hopeful that my treatment plan would be successful. The Summer of 2004 I worked with Noelle daily and viligiantly. All of her small steps up the social phobia ladder all added up to big leaps forward. By the end of the Summer she was calling up family members and grandparents who had never heard her voice before and conversing with them for the first time. She was now able to speak normally outside of the school setting. She however still refused to speak at school. I knew children need to be treated at both home and school separately and that this would be the biggest hurdle to overcome because she had never had a teacher that was willing to invest in helping her overcome Selective Mutism. I desperately needed the cooperation of a willing teacher. \n\nWhen Noelle started 4th grade with Ms. Henry It was obvious that we had finally met the teacher that would be able to help Noelle overcome this great obstacle. Shannon immediately took an interest in Noelle and her disability and made it her number one goal that year to get Noelle speaking in class. I provided a book about Selective Mutism the first day I met Shannon and she immediately read it and studied Selective Mutism on her own time.  Shannon and I worked together to write out a classroom treatment plan for Noelle in taking steps towards being able to talk in class. She allowed me to take videos of Noelle speaking to the class from home and show them to the students. Shannon also worked with Noelle after school with several other students throughout the year in helping her to be able to talk to them. She also came to my home on various occasions to work with Noelle. Great gains were made early on. Gradually Noelle improved over the course of the year and she eventually was able to talk inside and outside of the classroom. By the end of the year a miracle occurred and Noelle was able to give a speech in front of her class. \n\nNoelle is almost 14 years old now! She is a social butterfly and is constantly getting in trouble for socializing too much in class. She was recently voted \u201cmost popular\u201d at her school! I am sharing this story because parents need to realize the great power and ability they have to heal their children.

If they do not say anything or start a conversation I physically cannot say anything to them. If they do try to make conversation, I feel really bad for them because I am not great at carrying it on and it probably seems like I am not interested. This also means I cannot make any new friends and the lessons are really awkward. Any tips for enduring college with selective mutism? The first steps would probably be to talk to whatever mental health support the college offers. Take a notepad with what you need help with if you feel you may not be able to talk about and if that is easier for you to communicate. That first step can be a pretty tough for someone with extreme anxiety but they are there to help and should be able to get you started.\n\nYou will probably want to see a psychiatrist or psychologist sooner rather than later, perhaps getting on an anti-anxiety medication or at least some sort of structured exposure therapy. Becoming part of a community of people who struggle with similar issues may be helpful, depending what is offered, just to see that you are not so alone in your trepidations and to come to see them more objectively.\n\nIt is an important aspect of life to be able to assert yourself and use your voice, it is pretty much the most powerful tool we have as human beings.

Basically, she was completely mute for many years. \n\nShe feels that being away from everything in nature may help her and so devised a way to go stay with a distant aunt in the Lake district, here she can speak straight away as she is away from all the stresses. \n\nHowever, I am not sure this will be entirely realistic? I could not speak at all in schools but was fine almost anywhere else but I am not sure how I would have felt in a completely new place\u2014even if I had wanted to go. \n\nHow do you think you would feel?\n\nThanks!  It depends, I would say. If she never met the aunt or does not know her that well, it is probably unrealistic (though I do not have any experience with SM due to abuse). If she was close to the aunt (maybe when she was younger), it would not be impossible for her to talk right away. For a good story, you might want to reconsider having her being able to talk right away, though. It might be better for character building if she overcomes her SM slowly, rather than jumping from \"completely mute for many years\" to \"speaking straight away\", even if it is only against one other person. Yes I think you are right about that! Thank you!  personally, i dont think she could talk straight away. i would say very quiet and reserved at first as the character is used to and then very, very slowly getting used to it and talking normally. other than that, the book sounds like an amazing idea. so excited! I would find it quite hard to imagine opening up to a distant aunt instantly. When I was young, it would take a long time to open up to others/strangers.", "Any other Selective Mutes out there who have severe blushing issues? Have had SM all my life and am now in my early 20s and over the past few years my blushing issues have become really bad \ud83d\ude12 people only have to talk to me for a few seconds or say my name and within a second I come over all hot, blushed and then my eyes start blurring - I know very well I look a right nervous wreck every time \ud83e\udd74\nI hesitate to talk to people at work to sort out issues/ask for help if I can manage it as I always show myself up - I have tried many times to put myself out there and experience more social situations and the issue never seems to subside.\nIt affects me massively, I quite often get people commenting that I have got crimson, red as a cherry, etc. Oh definitely. I am glad I was not the only one. It happened to me a lot, even when I was talking to people online. It went away after I recovered, thank god. How did you recover from it? I have tried therapy and even tablets and nothing helps... Exposure therapy is the most effective treatment. Starting hobbies helps, especially sports. I started horseback riding and the combination of animals and exercise helped boost my confidence so much. It also provides a safe place where I eventually made friends that I still have. But the biggest thing is a psychologist who knows what they are doing, since you cannot do it alone. But it is hard to find, since SM is not really taught to them.  Oh yes, lots of very embarrassing moments thanks to this. I do not have SM but I do have the blushing thing. I remember kids in school accusing me of lying about something because of the blushing. I am sure I would fail any kind of lie detector test because my body has a severe physiologic reaction to speaking and social situations. But it does not interfere with my life enough to be diagnosed anxiety. I also sweat, have freezing hands, mind will go blank and I have difficulty recalling words in the middle of conversations. \n\nNo solution for you as it is never really improved for me but reading the book Quiet about introverts really helped. It allowed me to accept myself, despite these difficulties and just kind of go with it without trying to change everything. But I also do a lot of avoidance to make this manageable. But I am happy with that and very happy in my life, so I guess it all depends on what is acceptable to you for a content life.", "So...it happened again Unfortunately I cannot stop crying. My throat feels tight and I am unable to speak. \n\nSomehow I thought I can do some voiceover stuff for my tiktok drafts but I hesitated then and now I am just regaining my breath and regulating my breathing. \n\nWhy is this so hard?\n\nI am trying to be more vocal but sometimes (like today) it is very difficult to overcome. I am going to set up an appointment with my GP to see if there is anything I should be doing that is more beneficial than what I am doing right now. \n\nIf anyone has some advice, please send it my way. I am supposed to mentally preparing myself to compete in something that involves talking for the most of it. Hugs\n\nI have it the same. Sometimes I just even cat read what I write down for voiceovers. \n\nI have no advice. :( I appreciate the hugs. I am feeling a bit better now. Let us see what the doctor says when they call back. This doctor referred me when my mum brought it up, so let us see what happens. I found that humming or shifting back and forth on my feet convinces my brain I am in a safe place a bit. It does not work all the time, but adding it to my coping mechanisms made me feel slightly better. When I was going through it I definitely forgot about humming. I have not tried the shifting but I want to try and remember it if I run into this again. Thank you!", "I think I have pretty much overcome the mindset of SM, but I cannot really get past the full threshold of committing to speaking....(definitely a rant here). I guess I am looking for more insight from those recovered and recovering, so fill me in. I feel like I am there mentally to start talking, maybe I am no longer afraid of the reaction but I am not entirely sure about that. I feel like I may be scared to start because then my life will change forever (be it is for the best, but yeah), though at the same time I want that change....I also am afraid of it. I feel like I am charismatic, confident, etc.....but that may just be in my mind.\n\n(Being 18...turning 19 in November) My goal was the 31st of July, starting from June 28th since that is when I wanted to really start to change. I feel like mentally I have changed significantly since then, it is just in practice I really have not. I think volume is my next true threshold that I will start to push to the max. \n\nIt is also in passing conversation I really do not know how to start anything, or have much of an interest in starting anything. It is like I want to be this expressive person but at the same time I do not care to be. I would love to just spill all my thoughts onto my Mom, or tell my Dad I want to get a motorcycle (with my own cash).....I want to start doing things by myself. Although I think when change will truly be made is when I get back to college for the first time in-person, there I will try to express myself at least better because my family is where I have the hard time speaking, to others I am just nervous but I can do it. So maybe it is then?\n\nTonight I definitely had the greatest mindset so far, although going into the night I was uneasy, but after a while my mindset changed back to normal/being better. I feel like I am at the point where all it takes is to start talking, and that is the crossroads. It is really breaking the barrier and not building the mindset anymore. I will die on the inside, but maybe that is where I need to die at least for a little while.\n\nAnd for more context, this want for change started after meeting a girl on the 28th, I want to try to pursue her or someone like her in the future/near future (it made me realize what I want out of life)...though again, at the same time that change scares me. Although, I want it at the same time. She is definitely perfect and that is the problem, I cannot miss that. And when I say perfect, I mean I am literally never going to find another girl like her, she can ride motorcycles, had the same first car which is not common (a car enthusiast car)...and we are the same age....but enough rambling about that. \n\nI just thought I had to get this out here, this is probably my 5th post on this sub, I try to not post that often unless it is very important to me...because I would probably flood the sub if I did. I honestly can relate. I feel like I am free of selective mutism and the barriers in my speaking but I am terrified of putting in the effort of finally speaking regularly because I will never go back. Even if that change will be better for me. I feel like I have no excuse for staying silent anymore because its not like its something I am forced to do. And now I am like \"now what?\" It is crazy because a month ago I would have pinned it on the reaction being the most, but now I feel like it is the committing. It is hard. All it takes is one day. I feel like I will be such a different person and maybe that is another reason. Very proud of you.\n\nJust understand that your family that has not seen you speak much before already has \"an idea\" about you and how you behave. I believe that if you just prepare in advance for the big reactions you might get (in part genuine surprise, in part shock that they had misjudged you, in part being happy for you) you should be able to go through the process of re-establishing yourself to your family and loved ones.\n\nBe careful setting yourself up for heartbreak, but best of luck all the same. She is definitely not perfect no offense. Thank you, I definitely just need to break that barrier at least a little more significantly. \n\nAnd yeah, for her I would go in expecting to leave as friends. It is good for me to grow in that way, since I do not have a lot of experience there. They definitely did make me realize more what I want in life, so that is good. Although it is true, I really do not know this girl more than when I initially met her which was brief; she seems perfect. And no offense taken, I appreciate the honesty.", "How do i get someone to understand SM? my mom (who i am not very close with) says it is a choice. that it is just a symptom of anxiety and not it is own diagnosis. she actually works in a mental health hospital which baffles me as to why she does not understand it.\n\nwe were arguing about it and she was like \u201cwhere is your selective mutism now?\u201d and she went on about how one of her friends kids has not talked in his whole life. that is a completely different situation to mine and i know i am privileged but i just want her to understand it. u/P00ld3ad has some brochures and useful sites you can send to her. Unfortunately, most psychologists do not understand what SM is, especially ones that have been working for longer because SM\u2019s name was not changed from elective mutism to selective mutism until 1991. I have found the best thing that helps people understand is sending them (or showing them) articles about SM. I will link some below. \n\n( an infographic I made about SM. It is fairly short and gets straight to the point so I think this is probably the best thing to send to someone, rather than a longer article.\n\n( one of my favorite articles about SM. It even goes over what treatment for SM usually entails.\n\nI hope this can help you. All the best. She sounds like she has an emotional need to deny that you have something.  Or - not.  I do not know.  But she does not sound very interested.  You can give her material on it, but then, it is in her court, and there is nothing you can do to get her to believe it.  I do hope I am wrong.  Let us know how it goes! Maybe you can try to find someone else to help you with this issue... Maybe you can talk to her about seeing a psychologist, do not mention you are planning to discuss SM with the psychologist, just that you think it is in your best interest to do so, and then only disclose your fears about SM to the psychologist once you really feel comfortable with them and they have proven they are trustworthy and also you might have to educate them on what SM is all about, if they have not heard of it.

I never really have been known to specialize that much, when I am in a good mood it is easy to talk to People for a little bit, but it takes up so much energy that I quickly go back to being quiet and softly speaking.\n\nThe only real reason why I am able to push through and speak is because my dad always yelled and me and sometimes even slapped me for speaking softly and mumbling. Whenever I talk to someone, my anxiety spikes like I am being held hostage.

Hello, you appear to have asked a question about whether you have selective mutism. \n\nWe can help you understand selective mutism with ( Please remember that our members can only give you an opinion on whether you meet the criteria for selective mutism, not a diagnosis. If you would like to be properly assessed, it is highly recommended to see a medical professional. ( section of the wiki.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/selectivemutism) if you have any questions or concerns.* Hello, first of all I am really sorry for what you went through.\n\nIt does sound likely you have some kind of social anxiety disorder or something similar, but no one here can diagnose. As you noted, SM is the complete inability to speak, not just difficulty speaking. So although what you described as a child does not sound like SM to me, it still does sound like something you wanted help for. Not being able to speak for hours due to mental breakdowns nowadays might be SM, but it could also be symptoms of panic attacks or other similar things. No matter what is causing it, you can still look at the links on this subreddit and see if anything is useful. I think OP almost surely has it, because the main point of sm is anxiety being a massive brick wall preventing you from speaking. This stops you from speaking most of time, but its possible to push through it. People with SM can find themselves in a place between difficulty speaking and not being able to speak at all. The possibility of having SM does not vanish the second you say something to someone. Since your life sounds super similar to mine and I have been diagnosed with SM, *I* can almost guarantee you have it, but of course see a therapist and have them diagnose you.\n\nSince the condition is not well known, ask them if they know what selective mutism is(do it in writing if you cant say it), and if they do not, then obviously you should not trust the diagnosis.\n\nI am not just saying this. A school mental health counselor (who did not know what SM was until I told her to search it up) tried to tell me that I dont have SM and I am overexaggerating my symptoms. A week later, a therapist (who knew what SM was before I came) told me I had it for sure.", "Today is your last chance to take our selective mutism survey!

Currently I only talk to 1 person from school, but am unable to hang out with him outside of school because his parents are way too strict.

Maybe I can make one if I am lucky, but I doubt the friendship will last once I graduate.\n\nAt this point I feel like the easiest/only solution is find a friend with SM because there would not be a big fear of being judged or ridiculed.

When people are suffering they often take their anger out on everyone. People with SM can only speak to people online and family members.

I do not know if this is the right choice.\n\nI know its not a decision he is making, and I know that SM is not a universal experience, but I would love any advice from someone with more insight. Is it wrong to withdraw from being involved in his treatment? Does it remove pressure to have a line between the stress of his treatment and our relationship, or does it distance me from him more?

I want to spend more time with him, but I do not want to stress him out/feel like I am putting pressure on him.

I always thought I was the only person with this problem, but it turns out there are many other people!\nSo I will share my story. I am a 15 year old female, I am not diagnosed but I strongly believe I have been suffering from SM my whole life. Ever since I started school, I have been struggling a lot to communicate with anyone outside of my family. When I started kindergarten, I could not talk to anyone. I was bullied a lot and could not tell them to stop, so I often took out my anger in the wrong ways, like throwing toys at people, or crying. My teacher had a meeting with my parents and suggested I get treatment at school (you know, put me with the kids who have disabilities), but my parents did not believe I had any disability because I was talking fine at home. So they refused. As I grew up, I made one friend in first grade. She was the only kid from grade 1-5 that I was completely comfortable talking to. Her presence helped me so much. My SM was improved a lot with her as my friend, and I was able to talk to other kids and to the teacher, though I was still shy and quiet. When I got to grade 6, she got too busy with her other friends and stopped talking to me. That is when I realized she really does not understand me, she just thought I was a little shy and now wanted more talkative friends. \nEverything started going downhill since then. I was all alone at school. My SM became as worse as it was in kindergarten. I was getting bullied again. Everyone thought I was weird and disabled. There were these two girls who treated me like I was completely dumb, but I could not tell them to stop. School became so bad for me, and I began to skip school a lot. I stopped participating in gym because somehow, I got a phobia of sports balls at the same time. I stopped participating in music class because the teacher never taught me how to play the flute properly, and I was embarrassed to play in front of everyone. My music teacher was mean to me and told me I am being immature and disrespectful. It went to the point where I wrote a suicide note to my teacher, and they contacted my family, and it was a big mess. My family was really upset that I felt this way, because they always tried to keep me happy. My parents are the best and I do not blame them for being angry.\nBut I am still angry at myself for being like this. I am angry at myself for being born like this, never being able to do what the other kids did. When I started high school, the new environment helped me socialize more. However, at this point of time, I am forcing myself to speak. I do not have a choice anymore because my grades depend on my communication, so I just push myself to talk no matter how hard it is. I made a buddy in one of my classes, and speaking to her is mostly comfortable. But we were only friends in that class, so it was just temporary friendship.\nAnyways, that is my story. If anyone has advice on how to treat myself, it would be greatly appreciated. I still have more obstacles to get through in my life, and advice would be very helpful. Tell your parents that you would like to see a psychologist who specializes in CBT. You need someone to talk to who understands SM and can help you step by step. Do not ever give up! That is the issue though, I cannot access any therapy due to personal reasons. I was wondering if there is any advice on how I can try to treat my SM on my own. Hi Kittens20, I have two suggestions, I was incredibly quiet as a kid, not quite to your level, but close. And I did not come across these coping mechanisms/treatments/lifesavers until i was in my 30s. \n\n1. Get a pet. Preferably a dog. I had cats previously, but my dogs make much more eye contact. Practice talking to your dogs, practice holding eye contact while talking. Say silly stuff, narrate your day, talk about your feelings (this is my kryptonite). Plus a dog will make you feel much less lonely.\n2. Try to find an improv class (this is crazy right?). What it does is let you practice saying things with a very low stakes in failing (at the end of the conversation, another one starts up again with a clean slate).  Do not aim for funny, aim for just talking and being present and supporting your scene partner. And people will be genuinely delighted if you say weird stuff.  \nHave your parents talk to the instructor beforehand. The instructors should be used to shy people, as plenty of people use improv to improve social fears, and should let you just choose to just do hand movements or miming (which are part of communication and a big part of improv) until you feel ready to speak. Intro classes should let you stop a scene whenever you get overloaded, so you can mime three things or say three words and be done(!). You can google psych studies that have shown real progress in people with high social anxiety when they do improv.   \nAnd do not let them try to tell you that you have to perform in a show at the end of the class. That is 100% optional. Just skip it or show up to support your new friends.  \nIt took me about 3 years from the time I thought of it to the time I did improv and I desperately wish I would have gone sooner. And it took me the entire first 6-week class to not completely panic every time I showed up. But it was so worth it. Thank you for the suggestions! Unfortunately I cannot acquire a pet (though I really want to!), and I do not think my SM would not allow me to have a conversation in front of the class...that is too much for me :( I am still struggling a lot with speeches in front of the class. I still have to improve a lot until I can do something like that. But thank you for the ideas. Hi Kittens20, I am a women who used to have/mostly overcame SM (I had an unofficial diagnosis from an online certified therapist) Here are a couple of suggestions you may find helpful. \nExposure therapy is kind of obvious here but you do not have to jump to like a 10 right away. \nWhat I found helpful growing up is that I would read a lot of books out loud alone. It helped me become more used to the sound of my own voice. \nMaybe next you could try is small things like \u201cpass the salt\u201d or small requests to people you sorta know/acquaintances or small comments or you could practice having longer conversations with people you find that you are comfortable with. Start small and work your way up. I know you do not have pets but if you ever run across one, also decent way of practicing if you are not ready for people yet. \nBut hey  it is okay that this stuff does not happen overnight. Just remember that if you are frustrated. The fact that you are trying to put in the work to change is proof of your character. \nI hope this is an okay start and let me know if something does not work for you. I will see what I can come up with \nCheers Thanks for the advice! I will definitely keep this in mind. From now on I will hopefully find more students in my classes that I can become friends with and try to communicate more....baby steps do work for me...also never knew about reading books out loud, though I kind of feel like it is weird? Like if I am reading a book out loud in my room and someone comes in and says \"who are you talking to\" XD I dunno. I will continue to make more progress at school, that is for sure :) Honey, I totally understand. You are not alone. As a kid, I felt a lot like you did. Again, you are not alone. I really encourage you to reach out to a counselor via the internet. There is a woman psychologist featured on this sub who really gets it. Maybe you can show your parents, too. Or someone who can understand. \n\nThere are answers out here and people who care. You have so much to offer the world and so many important things to tell us (in whatever way you wish). I would strongly encourage you to continue to do what you are doing now- choosing to express yourself. When you conquer this, you will have a deeper understanding of others and life in general. You can message me any time. \u2764\u2764\u2764 i dont know anyone personally that understands :( and i feel like its unsafe to talk to strangers on the internet about personal stuff...i feel like i said too much in this post and i want to delete it... I am surprised you got bullied, how can someone be mean to a sweet silent girl :/\n\n I suffered with selective mutism as a child and throughout my teen years. My teachers and the other kids were always exceptionally sweet to me and always tried to get me to talk (it never worked but I always appreciated their kindness). Usually there was one or two girls in my class that became extremely protective over me and always tried to help me out and get me to come out of my shell.\n\nWhen I got into my teens people were less sweet, but I was still never bullied. I think the fact that I was considered attractive probably helped.", "is it possible that i have a form of sm? i will get straight to the point. i know i have social anxiety, but one thing that became apparent ever since i started my current school back in june that i found weird was that i just do not talk to people. as in, i physically cannot talk. the words, no matter how hard i try, will always get stuck in my throat. \n\nokay, i can talk to some people but it is a bit complicated. i can talk to my friends, but i still find it a bit difficult. usually, i will want to say something but by the time i am prepared to say it the conversation has already moved on and i am one of the quietest one in the group and i am the most awkward. i can talk to teachers on occasion, but if i want to ask a question, the words just will not come up. i can talk to my family, but the only ones i am actually close to are my mum and my big sister. even then i am usually quiet around them. to make matters worse, i live with family that i am not even remotely close to and do not have any common interests with. \n\noutside of those groups, i do not talk to people, at all, really. i have stopped going to coffee shops because i feel like i physically cannot order, i exclusively use self checkout and if someone says \u2018hello\u2019 to me on the street, it freaks me out and the most i can do is smile at them. and i feel like it is going to get worse because of this quarantine stuff. i fear that when i go back to school i will just stop talking completely. \n\nso do you guys think i have sm, or something similar? i have tried speaking to my dad about how i physically just cannot talk to people at school but he basically brushed it off and said \u201cwell, that is good because you should not be speaking in class anyway\u201d. i tried explaining that i do not speak even when i am meant to but he just shrugged it off so i cannot exactly get help for this right now, but some clarity would be nice. sorry if this does not make sense btw, i tried to condense it but i have been thinking about this for a while so it is kind of just all been blurted out lol. the feeling of not physically not being able to speak pretty much is what SM is plus you said you have social anxiety so it is probably it. i cant officially diagnose you tho so i recommend seeing a specialist I recommend going to your doctor to get I diagnosis. Use a text to speech app on your phone to talk if you need to. i cannot though. my dad will not take me and i do not know where our doctors is. yeah. i will try and see a specialist but i doubt my dad is going to take me since he just keeps brushing it off and i do not actually know where our doctors is lmao Look it up on Google maps. Do you know another family member or a friend who could take you? i do not think i have any family in the area that could take me. i have my mum and my sister but they live three hours away. my mum works in mental health though so she might be able to help me out. I think your mum would be the best option since she works in metal health.

I know its just a joke but oh my god it is like it never stops?? I dont even know how to bring it up to them, i just go mute afterwards. All they will do is deny or tell me its not a big deal because it is a joke. At this point, I am very use to it. In fact, i expect it from everyone. Is it because I am small and weak? I am about 5'0 ft tall and 115 lbs, I am a bit small so i do see why im an easy target. I never really feel safe with anyone nowadays, what about me makes people want to hurt me? Why cannot I be treated like I am another person? Why do people treat me less? Why cannot i be like other people? It is like i never have a break. Do i deserve this? What did i do?

Hating your voice is a symptom of SM that should improve as you recover. There is not much you can do outside of that I think most people do not like the sound of their voice. Just keep recording and listening to your voice. Sing if you want. You just need to get desensitize. I am fine with my voice until I hear a recording of it. I cover my ears anytime someone play the phone message I left. I totally get that. I record myself for presentations sometimes, for school you know, and everytime the teacher plays one of those, well let us just say I end up looking even more cringe and making social anxiety worse. this is something almost everybody around you is experiencing at the same time, the only real way to build confidence i guess is to change your perspective. how many times have you judged someone based on their voice or thought it was particularly stupid sounding? odds are its close to never and the truth is that is how often people are thinking about yours to be honest i used to hate how i looked so i just forced myself to look at pitures of myself.\n\ni used to hate my voice, then got over it and now its back again, the main problem to me is though that my internal voice is very differnt to my extermal voice, which is much higher than i though it was Yeah same Honestly, I joined a choir. Sounds weird for someone with sm but I would stand in the front corner (nobody can hear you if you stand in front of them and you cant hear yourself because of the people behind you)  I dont really know why that worked but I definitely got more confident in my voice after that. If you cant or will not join a choir than I would recommend singing along to music. Turn it up louder than you can sing if you are not ready to actually hear yourself along with it I used to be selectively mute and hated my voice. And guess what? I still do. \n\nI dont think the hatred will ever go fully go away. You just have to be brave and use your voice even when you hate it. Im recording and writing music now, so its required and I still cant stand my voice, but i force myself to listen to it every single day, so Ive gotten used to it. \n\nAlso, choosing to believe that most people do not care about the way I sound, is a great way to not allow the hatred of your voice stop you from doing anything. Hope that helps. Hey!! Look up \u201cvoice confrontation!\u201d Your voice does not sound the same to you as it does to others, because in your head you hear it from the inside, and outside of your head you only hear the outside mechanics of the voice! :) I started doing vocal exercises and Discord calls every day as exposure therapy because I wanted my voice to sound more like my internal monologue. I used to speak in a lower tone, which threw me off because I was not used to hearing myself. In about two weeks, my pitch got to where I felt comfortable.\n\nI do not know how effective this is for others, and it takes a lot of effort, but it can increase \"stamina\" for conversations.

There are moments where I cannot speak at all. I will open my mouth, but its like my throat swells closed. These moments are rare though in adulthood. \n\nMore commonly, It just takes a lot of effort. For example, sometimes i will be working with a client and will want to say something about what I am seeing/feeling. but its like a mental block. The obscene amount of effort it would take me to vocalize my thoughts make it not worth it, but I technically can vocalize. \n\nOther times I am able to think clearly, but I cant put them into words. In these moments I can speak, but i cannot convey my messages. Its more like I can repeat phrases that I have heard to try to convey my thoughts, or I can get similar words to what I mean, but cannot seem to string my own sentences appropriately. Which means that what I say may not make sense. \n\nEx: \"I am making hungry?\" instead of \"do you want me to make some food?\"\n\n\"Too many cooks will spoil the broth\" might mean \"please get out of my space you are too close to me\"\n\nOr \"my face hurts\" instead of \"im feeling self conscious about the acne on my face\"\n\nSo im wondering what parts of this are selective mutism? In several examples i can speak. Thanks for any info! I recently discovered \u201cexpressive language processing disorder.\u201d I was SM until about 8th grade and could never explain my challenges to people. I was labeled shy, but it was so much more than that. Now as an adult, I still struggle to speak and write, but have overcome it by forcing myself to do it all the time. I still say weird things and overthink what I am trying to communicate and stress about how people view me. I literally found this disorder yesterday while trying to figure out why I am like I am. I brought it up to a therapist and they are going to do some investigating for me. It would explain so much of my trouble which sounds similar to what happens to you. This. Expressive language disorder is definitely a possible complication of having SM. I struggled with it at one point because of having SM for so long and went to specific therapy for it. So interesting. Which do you think came first for you? I was assuming that I had SM because I have a LPD. How old were you when you got into therapy and what kinds of things were included in the treatment? Pardon all my questions, but I am so excited to possibly have a diagnosis to explain my situation. SM first. I developed symptoms of SM when I was about 4 years old, and started having signs of expressive language disorder when I was about 12. I think when you have SM for so long you are almost deprived of social interaction for so long your social and expressive language skills can become impaired. That is why early intervention is really important.\n\nFor treatment I went to a speech language pathologist (speech therapy) for a while and we worked on basic writing, and slowly built up to writing more. It was a bit complicated given I had SM at the time as well, but I would say it was pretty effective all things considered", "What is something that writers get wrong when creating characters with selective mutism, and what is something they get right?

In the last 2 years of high school I was new to a school and it was the first time I actually feel SM and I though it was just social anxiety but I had social anxiety all my life and I still managed to have friends and talk normally but when I moved to this new school (in a new country) I though that i would stay quite till I got used to the school but In the full 2 years I did not have a single friends and I did not say a single word from the morning till I come back home, I just stayed by myself most of the time sleeping because I literally had nothing else to do and no one to talk to, and it was absolutely shitty, but when I finished high school and started uni my social life changed 100% and I started talking like a normal person around mostly anyone, \n\nIf you compared my situation now and my situation 2 years ago you will be shocked, literally from 0 words a day to taking the whole day, \n\nAnd I am scared it might come back in the future because it was hell literally and I get so anxious looking back at it  It is possible that your SM will return, but it might help to just embrace that possibility and do what you can in the present moment to prevent that. Stay sociable when you have the opportunity to socialize and do not fall into bad habits like isolating yourself. Worrying about the future will not help you deal with the present or the future and it certainly will not change the past. Not worrying about the future while you have an anxiety disorder is certainly easier said than done, though.\n\nI am out of school and not socializing much, and that has certainly worsened my social anxiety. But I try my best to say hi to people I pass and participate fully in social settings like group therapy. I do not always succeed, but it is important for me to keep fighting against my social anxiety as often as possible because I know the more I give into my anxiety, the more difficult it will be to escape it.  this overview might clear up some of your questions. SM can certainly be overcome with a dramatic environmental change (going to university), or be compounded by a dramatic environmental change (school in a new unfamiliar country). Thanks for sharing that website. I know about SM from my own experience, but it is good to hear more about others' experiences as well. On a side note, I am grateful to have you moderating this community, it seems like you always have good things to share. :) That means a lot!

The advice is always \u201cfind new friends who treat you right\u201d but that is impossible for me, it is completely by chance that I could speak to this person as they were open with me and gave me a chance from the start. I dont feel like I could ever have that with anyone again so I keep going back to them because its better than being alone this is my biggest current problem atm. it makes me feel like giving up honestly it just feel pointless after losing a friend like that.

Overcoming it is not about will power, maybe you could argue that you have to make the choice to get better, but the best thing you could do is to seek professional help. Do not think you should be able to figure everything out by yourself. You would not just try to will yourself out of a cold, you would take specific medication and follow empirically tested treatments. It is the same for mental illness. \n\nMy issue got worse for a long time, for a variety of things, but I think the most important aspect of it was that I felt trapped in a situation where I felt as if I should not say anything or I would be harming my family. I was also an immigrant as a teen (not anymore though) and there was violence at home, but I thought I would be responsible for getting us deported if I talked to non immigrants, and that other immigrants would reject my claims I was being abused for fear it would reflect badly on us all. Anyway, I never got help, so I did not get better. I encourage you to seek out professional help. I do not know how young you are, but when I was a teen and struggling with communication, I do not know how I could have navigated the health care system or other options on my own. If your family is open to taking this issue seriously, I encourage you to talk to them, so they can help you have someone evaluate you.\n\nHonestly, there is also a lot of free info on the internet that can help. SM is an anxiety disorder, so I have learned how to manage it from people who also have them. ( I learned DBT skills on my own, and they really helped ( but I also take medication and go to therapy. I have learned a lot of stuff on my own that kept me going when I could not afford therapy, though, so do not be afraid to go the self-help route, especially if your issue itself might at the moment be making getting help hard. It is a very particular sort of issue. Everyone knows the cure for mental illness is talking to a therapist/doctor, but what if you cannot talk?\n\nBooks can be another resource (\n\nThis author has a great youtube channel:\n\n(\n\nSome representation ( wow i did not know there were so many resources out there. thank you! :) hope they help, there are probably also many others... Katy Morton on YouTube also makes videos about coping strategies that are flexible to use and about therapy, what to expect what is normal and not, how to know if you should stick around or find someone else.... Critical information for basically anyone!!!\n\nAlso googling specific issues, like I have trouble concentrating or falling asleep can help you figure out ways to cope, although an expert on your issue would be better equipped to give you the best advice for your specific problem I have this exact problem but i cant talk to my family in english but i can in chinese.

As the title suggests, I have recovered from SM, at a pretty early age, right in 6th grade, but I feel like I have not fully \u201crecovered\u201d. \n\nAnyways, I feel like even if I started to talk, I found it a chore. Or that it was difficult to open my mouth to talk unless I had to. It is also been a struggle to make decent conversation, especially small talk. There is also the fact that sometimes it just feels like you cannot talk. You are trying but it is so difficult to formulate words. \n\nAnyone else feel that way? I would love to hear others experiences! I feel the same! I recovered 5 1/2 years ago but sometimes I feel like I fall back into old habits, not being able to talk, overthinking what I am saying, only talking when being talked to or feeling insecure about talking, scared of saying the wrong thing.\nFrom what my speech therapist told me when I was being treated, it is totally normal and you cannot 'cure' SM, so I am pretty sure many of us feel like it is exhausting to talk bc being silent is comfortable and it is what we have known for so long, so it is what we do when we are in situations where we do not know what we are supposed to do.\nWhat I personally like to do is look back at where I started to see how far I have come. I realised that I have to be proud of myself for the things I have achieved rather than criticise myself for the things I still struggle with. However, of course it is normal to want to push yourself and get better, you just have to remember that there is more to you than just SM and try not to blame or hate yourself for your condition bc that is what I did for a long time but it only puts pressure on you It is sounds like you still have some social anxiety that affects your ability to think in social situations as well as you can when you are by yourself. I started recovering from SM 8 years ago and I still have social anxiety but it is way less than before and I continue to get better. The long term solution to anxiety is Graduated Exposure Therapy which is facing what it is you are afraid of, one small step at a time. While you do that, there are also some short term techniques you can use that have helped me. I always chew gum bc it helps calm me a little. When your brain senses danger (a social situation), you feel a desire to stimulate your nerve endings to calm yourself e.g. rubbing the back of your neck, pinching the front of your neck, rubbing your palms on your thighs or against each other. I do these action on purpose sometimes before a social situation to calm myself. Also, doing a breathing exercise before a social situation has helped me more than anything. All you do is inhale for 4 seconds, hold that breath for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, and hold your breath at the bottom of that exhale for 4 seconds, and repeat over and over again. This can be subtle and people will not know you are doing it but it calms me a lot and I am able to think better during anxiety inducing situations. But in the long run you have to continually and purposefully face bigger and bigger fears to lower your anxiety meter so that everyday conversations become easy and enjoyable. I wish you the best!!", "Does topic-related SM exist? I read the description of SM, and wanted to know, if not being able to talk about certain topics can fall under selective mutism, too, or if the triggers have to be \u201csituational\u201d?\nI am asking, because I seem to be unable to talk about certain things and exhibit quite some of the mentioned symptoms, but it has nothing to do where or with whom I talk, only those certain topics can do this. \n\nI hope this kind of post is okay here, I have not been frequent in this sub. \nThank you in advance! I think so. I definitely clam up more about some topics than others.\n\nI am not sure if that is a medically recognised thing or not, but you are definitely not alone with it! Anything that causes anxiety can make you mute. If a topic gives you anxiety you will not be able to talk about it. Weird that people do not give you anxiety but topics do, if it is just one thing you might simply be too embarrassed to talk about it. It is possible you do not have selective mutism, but you might. It is most topics that deal with how I feel. I used to cut, and I really really wanted to tell my (very supportive!) family and friends but it took years and nights with alcohol and even then lucky incidents and still so much willpower to just show them and then answer questions. That is just an example, one where showing them instead of telling was a possibility. There are some others where it was not. So as \u201cone\u201d topic, it is my inner thoughts and feelings, those that emotionally touch me in a unpleasant way. I can also go mute in confrontational situations of any kind, though.. You might have it, most people with SM cannot talk about their feelings, or if you really just hate talking about how you feel you could have avoidant personality disorder. I have a similar problem. As a child my SM showed when I was supposed to talk to adults. \n\nNow I can talk to everyone to some extent but when I have to talk about my feelings or some other more serious stuff I shut off and I am not able to say anything even to people that are close to me like my ex was for example, once I was not able to talk to him and wrote what I wanted to say on my phone. I was always a shy and quiet girl, I do not know if there was a specific group of people I did not talk to, but when strangers tried to talk to me I often hid behind my parents legs or something. \n\nI have often used whatsapp, too, to communicate important things to my friends that I could just not get out with them in front of me. One understands and accepts it pretty well, and now I can to some extend tell her stuff that I could not before, but the other does not really understand..", "Is selective mutism only linked to social anxiety? I am a teenager. I am a very anxious person who gets panic attacks a lot. I have only mild social anxiety though, as I have worked on it a lot through therapy. \n\nI have deep seated trauma around my own sensitivity, and often become mute in situations where I am sharing my feelings, whether it is my parents or my therapist who I must share with. I try to talk. but I physically cannot. I will not be able to talk for rather long periods of time after an upset like this. I am not sure whether this is indicative of selective mutism because I only see it linked to social anxiety, not other triggers. Would anybody be able to help me on this? Thanks so much in advance. It is linked to PTSD and other traumas. What you describe sounds very much like what I have experienced. But I cannot say if you do or do not have SM My daughter has sm. She gets emotionally overwhelmed and shuts down. In public or just with our family with whom she otherwise talks too normally. It is very difficult for everyone involved. And to me is the worst part of the condition. It is not linked to PTSD or trauma. \\&gt;  Is selective mutism only linked to social anxiety?\n\nNo. EVERY time I have been alone with a boy, I am not afraid; I just do not know what I am supposed to say and how to act. Neither the computer science nor math departments taught that. I never dated in high school and hid during college.\n\nUnless you are fat, any girl can get sex--and I do, a LOT. But *only* in a context where I do not ever have to speak at all (gagged).  I am single and wish I was not sometimes. I think letting guys fuck me is a substitute for talking to them, because I do not know how (I am autistic). Thank you for correcting me. I did not mean to be spreading miss information. I have only experienced sm. I have not done much research into it/related issues. Thank you for your insight! Yes, I am not looking for a diagnosis here, rather looking into whether its a possibility for me, so that I can go to a GP about it. Again, thank you :) Thank you for sharing your experience. I hope it gets better for you all. Aww :( Hope things get better for you, Thanks for sharing your experience. quite possibly, yeah it can be. i think it can come from a lot of different things though. i have the same issue when trying to talk about my thoughts and feelings, where even with close friends and such i kind of just shut down absolutely not. There might be involved specific disregard towards a person or a group of people", "Anxiety and selective mutism So I have never met anyone else with selective mutism. I wasnt really sure if any other people felt that theirs was linked to anxiety. Since I have always been able to talk to certain people unless I am upset.\n\nSo I find that I am able to speak when I am at home or with my SO. Is this normal? Or did the doctors misdiagnose me? Because lots of the posts on here about how it comes and goes sort of confuse me since I dont get the same thing. Yes that is very normal Thank you so much. This helps me alot. From age 8 to 14 I was able to talk to my family and my friends. I could not speak in front of a class or other group and could not speak to strangers such as a bus driver or shop assistant. I could sing perfectly well. I was in a choir.\n\nThe headmaster wanted all pupils to read to him. I was able to do that in a non-threatening situation.\n\nAt age 14 I went to a speech therapist who taught me to breathe properly and to relax. I was basically cured after a few weeks. I do not see why everybody cannot be cured of SM, with the right therapist. However I have not met anyone else with SM. I have met plenty of people who stutter. I have lived a rough life. Getting beaten, stabbed, sexually abused and more. My anxiety is not just what I was born with anymore. I live with ptsd and more. My issues arent just cured in a few weeks. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder, so it is definitely linked to anxiety. And the selective part means that you can talk to some people/in certain situations, but not others. So what you are describing is typical for SM. Okay thanks. I just dont know anyone who can guide me in this... I am exactly the same. Went through significant trauma as a child, and now have selective mutism linked to anxiety and ptsd. You are definitely not alone with this. It does feel like it sometimes, though :/ Yes, that is normal. Selective mutism is defined as a severe situational anxiety disorder characterized by the inability to speak and communicate in certain social settings (school, work, parties, everyday errands, etc) due to severe anxiety. They are able to speak and communicate in settings where they are comfortable, secure, and relaxed, such as at home. Thanks.", "Is it possible that I had/have selective mutism? (More details below) I just thought that I was painfully and unbearably shy. My mother said that I always preferred to play by myself even as a young child, although I still played with my cousins from time to time. I did not really talk to the adults in my extended family when they came over and I remember hiding from them until my father came and got me. When I was about 5 I remember my father dropping me off at this class they enrolled me in at the local community centre. My older sister was already there for 2 years. My dad took me to the teacher on the first day and I refused to let go of my dad. She tried to coax me by telling me if I continued to cling to my dad like that he would get small. I just shook my head. I do not remember how they got me to let go but apparently I did. At school, I had two friends but they were twins and they were my neighbours so I knew them before. I wanted to make more friends but I was too shy. I would not talk to teachers. Idk if this is noteworthy but once during a test the teacher was passing around and when he saw my answers he made a comment about how it looked like I revised my work. For some reason, I thought he was making fun of me and changed my answers and when he passed back he was really confused as to why I changed my answers especially as he made that comment. Anyway, as I grew older I was able to talk to them but only to answer when they asked me something. I remember in Year 6 I had to present a thing together with another student in front of the class. I dreaded it and I wished I had gotten sick so I could stay home. It was just a few lines and I could not finish it. The teacher thought that I had not prepared and I got in trouble. \n\nBy the time of secondary school I was fine talking to my peers even if they were not close friends or not in the same class. However, I still could not talk to teachers unless spoken to. I never asked them a question in or out of the classroom. I avoided them out of the classroom. I never went to the staff room except with a friend and they did the talking. With especially strict teachers I would feel like I was going to throw up because I kept thinking what if they called on me to answer. My hands would get cold and would sweat. Most teachers I could not even ask to go to the toilet. Sixteen years old and I could not do that. In Year 12 I remember my chemistry teacher had called on me to answer but I just could not even though I knew the answer. Nothing came out. She quickly moved on though. Every single one of my teachers told my parents that I \"needed to come out of \\ shell.\" I got grades though, mostly As and some Bs.\n\nI dreaded university. There was no way I would be able to function there. I was supposed to be an adult. I avoided face-to-face, one-on-one interaction with my lecturers as much as I could. There were a few a few times that I just froze but they were nice about it. Email reduced a lot of stress for me. I was not the most social person but I was able to talk to other students fairly normally (at least in my eyes) though I do think that I came across as shy and reserved.\n\nThe first job that I had ever gotten I left because everyday and every minute my stomach felt queasy and I would hide in the bathroom sometimes to try to catch my breath. I was not super chatty or anything but it was horrible. I did not want to quit but I did. I just could not do it. I was extremely lucky though. The grant thing covered most of my tuition and my parents were able to cover the rest. I switched over to online or distant learning after a while, before the pandemic had hit. My mother has a small business and I would would help out when I could. Most times I did not really need to talk to help someone. I never understood how my mother could just strike up a casual conversation with customers. We mostly see the same customers everyday since it is in a semi-rural area. Some of these customers I have been seeing since I was a child.\n\nI know I have social anxiety and I have been trying to help myself however I can since I cannot afford therapy and a lot of people around me do not really understand why I cannot just talk to people. I learned about trying to calm myself down with breathing techniques and how to approach the catastrophizing way of thinking before a situation and reducing the \"postmortem\" I tend to do. It is slow-going and sometimes I just do not have the presence of mind to employ the techniques but it is been helpful thus far. I mean it is a process.\n\n**Tldr: I have social anxiety disorder and when I was young I did not talk to my extended family members and teachers even though as I grew older I was able to somewhat engage in** (barely a) **conversation with them though it takes significant effort to do so and sometimes I still freeze to the point I cannot talk.**\n\nIs that a form of selective mutism and seeing that it seems to stem from my social anxiety would the techniques for managing social anxiety help or do I need additional techniques to address the mutism issue also? The first step is to do to your doctor and get diagnosed. Depending on where you live you might be able to access specialist support. Thank you for responding. Thanks for asking. No, I did not. I do not know how to ask for help in real life. When it comes down to the moment to ask or take action I just cannot. I either avoid it or just do not book that appointment or automatically say no for some reason when my doctor asks if I have any questions.", "Can I develop it later in life? So I think I may have se. When I was a kid I phased in and out of being able to talk and only was able to talk to close people in those times. I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD also. I am older now and with extremely heightened anxiety due to COVID-19 it has gotten to the point I just cannot push words out to anyone but my family and girlfriend who I have known since I was two. Other then that no speech at all. Is this possible? Also I should mention I have high functioning auto-aim and APD which is a form of being HoH What did it feel like being a kid and not being able to talk during those phases? Yeah I got it at 14 Like I would be able tot all to some people but anyone else it was to scary and even if I pushed through the fear and tried it just would not come out Who were those people? Was it like family or friends or certain peers? It was basically eveyone, the only people I could speak to was my brother, my dad, and a few friends I would say you have it then there are different types of mutism, selective mutism is not usually caused by PTSD, it also is not very common with autism, although autistic people can be non-verbal, that is not the same as selective mutism", "Advice on being a good aunt to my niece with possible selective mutism I have never really heard my 3 year old niece talk with the exception of the word \"Peppa\" (When she wants to watch Peppa Pig or sees a picture of her, etc)\n\nPreviously she would chatter away toddler gibberish to us and we would talk back as if to make conversation and she would seem pretty satisfied with it. Her mother noticed she was a little slow in learning words and forming sentences, and hoped she would just catch up like her sisters did.\n\nNow however, although improving slightly with her words/sentences with her parents, as soon as anyone else is in the room she will only say the word Peppa and otherwise stays pretty silent.\n\nThere is been no formal diagnosis yet, her parents are looking in to it so hopefully they will figure out what is wrong soon, but in the mean time I want to know what I can do to support and help my niece?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy focus is not so much helping her with her speech, although that would be a bonus, but more learning ways to communicate to/with her and play with her. I try to just talk to her like any other person, ask her questions about Peppa and what she is doing. She loves it when I pick her up and spin her and pretend to drop her, I also had great success the other day when I asked her to dance with me and we both had a little boogie on the sofa, she was all smiles and giggles. \n\nIf anyone has any tips/suggestions on ways to interact with her I would really appreciate it, I will leave the tackling of the issue itself to her parents, I would just like to be a good aunt and someone she feels she can trust and depend on to understand and have fun with her!\n\nThanks! SM does not usually come with developmental disabilities. Theres another underlying issue. I would get her to a dr asap. It seems you are doing well to try and interact with her on her terms and in a way she feels comfortable. I think you are doing a great job, and she is a lucky kid to have you in her life. Although it does not rule out a diagnosis of SM, delayed language learning is not in the criteria for SM (in fact one of the key components of SM is that its not caused by difficulties in language development)\n\nAlthough it still sounds like you are doing a good job of interacting with her in other ways eg. Being patient and continuing to treat her 'normally by playing with her I do not know if this is SM. Most people with SM have no problem forming words or sentences around their parents, and only have anxiety around speaking with others. Our son (6) has both SM AND some delayed development.  We were so lucky to find a therapist who is own child has SM. \n\nHere are few of the things we have learned/have been helpful:\n\nBreak silence: Activities that require  breaking a silent barrier. This is not meant to make the child talk, it is to get the kid to make any sound. Our therapist would blow bubbles and have our son clap them in his hands. For clarity, this is not tricking the kid to talk as much as getting them to make a sound - even nonverbal is a win. Like clapping. You said she giggled, that is great.\n\nFading: This one has been incredibly helpful but takes time. Have her mother or father get them talking about something they are excited about. Then you enter and participate as if it is no big deal. Over time, as you spend more time with the child and the parent - hopefully having a parent there, who is encouraging talking on the exciting topic - NOT about talking about it to you - they will begin to speak. When they do, the mother can casually excuse herself - \"I am going to the bathroom and I will be right back.\" That sort of thing.  Allow these absences to build in duration. \n\nThis one takes time. It took several encounters for our son to speak to his therapist, even though he obviously liked her and enjoyed seeing her. She had toys he was excited to play with that only she had. (We did not buy them for him at home. He could only play with them with her.)\n\nPurposeful wrong choices: This come a little later, after the kid is slightly more verbal with you.  Give two choices, the obvious one and a silly one. \"Should we have a cookie or should we  put a wig and dress on the dog and act like it is a person?\"\n\nFinally, thumbs up/thumbs down: Communication does not have to be limited to only what is said.  If you are asking yes or no questions and not getting a response, feel free to teach them thumbs up for \"yes\" and thumbs down for \"no.\"\n\nThings to steer clear of:  Do not try to shame them into talking. \"I just saw you talking to mommy, why will not you talk to me?\" or \"Speak up, I cannot hear you.\" That sort of thing.  Some kids (people?) with SM will draw a territory line around a place or person and never speak to them or there. \n\nDo not over celebrate if they do talk.  \"Look, I knew you could talk!\" You might honestly be filled with joy about it, but it is still shaming.\n\nFINALLY, she may not talk to you. And that will be completely okay. It is not you. The best gift you can give someone who struggles with SM is not to force them to talk but, instead, be a better listener. \n\nHope this helps. Good luck. I am aware it may not be SM it is just the closest thing I could relate it to, as I said, there is been no formal diagnosis yet, her parents are in the middle of getting one, as far as I am concerned it is not my place to assume her issues nor get her diagnosed, only to support her however I can outside of those things I am aware it may not be SM it is just the closest thing I could relate it to, as I said, there is been no formal diagnosis yet, her parents are in the middle of getting one. I was simply looking for advice from a group of people who I thought would be able to relate Oh ok! no worries. Sorry if that came out more harshly, I truly did not mean it that way. I would just make her feel comfortable and do not pressure her to speak. As soon as she is comfortable enough, it might start coming slowly :) Thank you so much, this is very informative! I love the breaking silence idea! And I had actually thought of the thumbs up/down but was not sure if it would work, but I will give it a go with her! \n\nI would never dream of shaming her in to talking but I did not think about the fact an over celebration could have the same negative effect! I will keep that in mind and just have a mini internal \"yay!\" Haha.\n\nI 100% do not mind even if she never utters a word to me (I mean, she is not even my child, so I would have no right to anyway as far as I am concerned!) I honestly just want her to grow up knowing it is okay and she is got support and people who will not judge/pressure her Sorry, I may have gotten a tad defensive there haha, I just do not want to offend anyone making it look like I am trying to diagnose her is all! I hope so, she certainly seems comfortable with us other than the talking so perhaps once the real issue is found she will make progress :) Oh you are fine :) I am glad I can be of help. I know for me it took a while to get comfortable with even my own dad (even though I love him very much), so it may take a while. It is worth the wait, though :D For sure. just SM support is not going to help if it is not sm. It is very specific. Our daughter (4) was recently diagnosed with SM and this is so important. The \"do not over celebrate if they do talk\" cannot not be said enough. My daughter \"slipped up\" and talked in front of her teacher and the teacher clapped/ put her hands on her face and daughter was severely embarrassed she said anything. Also, how is your child doing in school? My daughter is in pre-k and the teacher is stressing me out b/c she will have to learn to read next year and is telling me she will have to speak so that they can \"evaluate her.\" Because our son was officially diagnosed with SM by a therapist, it insured he received an IEP through his school. Have you spoken to your pediatrician about it? They may be able to direct you. \n\nIs this pre-k part of a real school or is it a childcare sort of thing?\n\nIf it is part of the school I would set up a meeting with the special education head and discuss your concerns regarding the upcoming year. \n\nIf it is a standalone childcare businesses, as long as they are not stressing your kid out to speak and your kid likes it there, smile and thank them for they are concern and that you are looking into all your options. \n\nOur son is doing okay in school. Things went really sideways for us early on because we did not understand what we were dealing with in regards to SM, AND we put too much faith in the school system. (Certainly a school with special need kids knows how to work with all needs, right? Wrong.)\n\nOur son now goes to a different public elementary school in Chicago where they do not pretend to have all the answers. But he gets the help needs and everyone is open to suggestions from both the teacher and parent sides. He is currently getting most of his schooling virtually in a one-on-one environment. I told his school appointed tutors (called the diverse learning team) about his interests (Zelda, Breath of the Wild). And By luck, hearing his teachers talk about video games opened him up to speaking, and catching up where he had fallen behind in school. We will see how that holds up once everyone returns to in person. Crossing fingers. Our daughter was diagnosed by a psychologist who we were referred to by our pediatrician. This is a real school, private, in south Louisiana and we are currently having school here, not virtual. I will ask if they have any sort of IEP. Thank you for your speedy response. I really appreciate it. ASL might be a good option to learn..", "Unable to talk to a counselor/therapist So I am a 19 year old female who has been diagnosed with SM since I have been around 8 maybe? Ever since around that time me, my mom, and my sister have pretty much went for a check up about every 3 months to see our therapist. I obviously have to tell my mom before if I have any concerns with my medications or anything so she can tell him. He and my mom both still try to get me to talk but every time I still get choked up  and want to cry just thinking about it. I am used to seeing him though and he is a really nice guy so I wish I could but I do not see that ever happening. I also was seeing a counselor weekly at one point after I attempted suicide once, and I was not able to talk to her either, so mostly her and my mom mostly talked about irrelevant stuff which did absolutely nothing. But currently, I have been dealing with different issues (depression, starting college, possibly BPD) and I feel like I am in desperate need of a counselor or therapist. I pushed myself to move an hour away for college (big step for me) so I am not even sure where to start looking for people but I think I need to ask help from my mom, which is another problem. I do not know if this is a typical SM thing but in addition to not being to talk to people I do not know at all, talking about my deep feelings or emotions with the people I am comfortable with breaks me down. When I first told my mom about my concern about my depression (which I had been holding in for years) I had to cry immediately. I worry that if I bring up the idea of me seeing someone else she will ask me for more details which I really do not want to provide, because the last thing I want to do is make her worry about me. That is also obviously going to get in the way of an appointment if I do find a counselor, how am I going to be able to talk about anything? I have considered the idea of typing what I want to say because it would be easier to physically do, but I eventually do want to try to be able to communicate my emotions freely and not have to rely on some other way, because like my therapist at home, if I typically do not talk to someone for an extended period of time then I feel even more scared to talk because I expect them to get excited or surprised if I do talk and expect more from me. Because of this I cannot talk to my uncle. My college already has free counseling services but they are packed and I am already on the waitlist, but I do not expect them to contact me anytime soon, so I think I have to find a place off campus. So yeah I think that is all my info, not sure if this was mostly a rant to explain my situation, but I would really appreciate some support and help (just found this subreddit). Also this is my first post so sorry if I did anything wrong, thanks. My son is diagosed with SM and he has not said a word to his counselor either (he is 5 y/o). I dont know if this would help but, one thing we do is kind of journal through out the week so I make sure to talk about what he needs. Would it be possible to essentially write letters to your therapist as a way to communicate on your own? This is a really great suggestion. It is always been easier for me to communicate through writing.\n\nThis could also work to your therapist's advantage since it will help them understand your thought processes better. Hey savy! I think the idea of writing to your therapist is a fantastic start, do not be afraid of relying on that for a while. I was the same, the thought of talking to someone made me burst into tears and it was writing that eased me into eventual verbal communication. I think being able to communicate in any means and have a verbal response given back is a good start because you are having a conversation, which to me was not as scary as feeling as if I had to talk to get a response from people. Get a whiteboard or a notepad and write your responses on that when your therapist asks you a question. If you are afraid of becoming completely reliant on writing then what I did was alternate between writing and talking through drawings and really shitty comics. It took me three months of intensive therapy to even say a word so remember to be patient with yourself! Increasing the amount of times you see your therapist might help too (if you live in a country without free healthcare do this if you can afford it), good luck!

Like not just talking? I am not officially diagnosed with SM but my family and therapists have all seemed to agree that I have it and have for pretty much my whole life. I find that I not only have trouble with speaking but text based communication as well. Even asking this is extremely difficult. I have an easier time if it is anonymous but even that is hard too. I have never been able to successfully work with a therapist because of this. Does this happen to anyone else? If so, has anything helped you? I have also had this problem. I get a little better but cannot really hold a conversation because of all the anxiety. Recently, I have been practicing on the Omegle text only part, but I have barely improved. Just keep talking both online and in person to the best of your abilities for practice. For me, after been in treatment for a while now, SM usually affects me during anxiety attacks.

In this programme, Helen meets some of those affected by SM, including parents and former sufferers as well as experts helping children to find their voice again.", "SM are only crises or stay silent for hours is also part of that? I have had this doubt for a while and I was wondering if selective mutism only attacks in the form of anxiety attacks or can it also be more subtle, such as making someone just decide to be silent for hours. SM creates an inability to speak causing the person freeze and be unable to speak until comfortable to do so SM is more talking in places not comfortable, for example you will not talk in school, like at all, but you will talk to close family. My daughter with sm has not spoken in about 4 months SM causes an *inability* to speak. It is not a choice. It usually presents as being completely unable to speak in any social setting, and typically they are able to speak in one setting they are comfortable in, such as at home. Its not uncommon to go mute during anxiety attacks, but I do not think that would be considered SM as it does not fit the criteria. I have tended to go completely mute for long periods of time after serious anxiety attacks since I was a child, and recently had a very serious one about seven weeks ago, and I have not been able to speak really at all since then. I am learning to cope, but I just... want more information. Do you think you can point me in the right direction?  SM is not \"I do not feel like talking right now,\" it is \"i physically cannot speak because of my anxiety.\" When I was younger, my SM was worse and i could not speak to distant relatives and people at school. Now it is just sort of progressed to when I am having anxiety attacks and I sorta shut down, it is still SM just not so severe that it impacts my life outside of anxiety attacks I have SM and it strikes when I have strong anxiety attacks, like in high school. What I wanted to know is if when I get non-verbal and close completely is something related to SM or if it is something else? Because when that happens, it is usually not out of anxiety or anything, I just start to stop talking and when I realize, it is been five, six hours and I have not spoken two words in that period and if I did it was because I was forced.  I have SM, I understand about the inability to talk and about anxiety attacks. What I want to know is if when I go six hours without saying anything this is a consequence of SM or not, even if it did not start with an anxiety attack but something that just happened and I did not even notice? Maybe it could just be from exhaustion? I do the same thing, I assume that it is because anxiety attacks can be so draining on you Because of the pandemic, I have not been out much and because I do not study anymore, it does not have strong attacks. On the issue of anxiety, I believe I am a little better. But everything else, maybe I am really exhausted.", "Bloody nose ended with me in a wheelchair. In class today I had a bloody nose and was not able to tell anybody and had no idea what to do. I ended up sitting back at my desk with a tissue. The teacher did not realize and I was having a panic attack. When the teacher finally realized I was shaking so bad that I could not stand up and he ended up calling the office. A few minutes later they showed up and put me in a wheelchair and took me out of class. It was absolutely humiliating and I could hear people snickering behind me. Worst day ever. Nose bleeds are difficult. I had one once and it took like 10 minutes before anyone realised when I was covered in blood because I had no tissue and was afraid of leaving without saying anything.

Could someone who is more experienced with this answer my question? Speaking definitely does not invalidate your SM! You were probably in a situation that really pressured you to talk, and sometimes that is just what you have to resort to.

I have always been curious about this transition I went through, long ago. I had classic SM during my childhood, up until puberty. It \u201ctransitioned\u201d into AvPD around that time - then I began saying around one word per week.\n\nI never received therapy when I had SM, but my GP thought I likely had it, and referred me to a child therapist. I had one session, and then my therapist moved away. I never was brought to be seen by anyone else. I am still upset pretty about this, but I really have no idea if it would have even help or not.\n\nI just have some questions, since I do hold some resentment of sorts about not receiving therapy as a kiddo. If you received therapy as a child, did it help you in any way at all? Did you ever become close enough to your therapist to actually speak aloud to them? Do you have any family history of SM.  I completely understand if you are uncomfortable answering these questions, so please do not feel pressured to answer, if it would cause you distress, or if you just do not plain want to.\n\nAt first, I resented my mom a bit for not trying harder to find a therapist after my first one left. I feel quite bad about that now.\n\nI am just curious about everyones success rate, for those who received childhood treatment.

I still have issues sometimes, but infrequently enough that it does not affect my life all that much.\n\nMy son has occasional SM when he is distressed, but if I suggest words, he can nod or shake his head. I am usually intuitive enough to guess the problem.\n\nI am sorry you feel resentful toward your mom, and it is understandable. Our parents do not always have the correct skill set in raising us. But is there anything you can do now to help yourself? Even getting a therapist to talk about your resentment seems like it may help.\n\nThanks for your courage in reaching out. :) My deepest apologies if you receive a reply from me twice. I cannot see the reply I wrote to you, anymore. :(\n\nYou are welcome to ask me any questions you would like. I am all for people an accurate idea of what classic SM is like, generally speaking.

I know people tend to say thanks when trying to be polite, but I am genuinely beyond grateful.\n\nI definitely nodded and shook my head when I had exclusively SM, as well. I could also write messages down, *usually*.\n\nI feel extremely bad about formerly resenting my mom, since she passed away when I was a teen.

Did you ever become close enough to your therapist to actually speak aloud to them? \n\nI have been in therapy since first grade I think. I have always been able to talk to my therapists but it would take me awhile, typically weeks or months, to be comfortable saying more than a few words. I was never properly diagnosed with SM as a kid so its possible I was not receiving as much help as I could have gotten. However, I did learn many coping skills throughout the years for my depression and anxiety. I think the therapy was mostly helpful in just giving me someone to talk to. \n\nI did not properly start to recover from SM until my freshman year of high school when I started with my most recent therapist. I was able to be very open with him, I think partially because he was a no-bullshit kind of guy and he was comfortable swearing and joking around with me. He was either the first or second therapist I had after being properly diagnosed, I cannot remember. As much as I love my previous therapists, my most recent one was the most helpful and I have improved a lot since I started meeting with him. I also had a bigger support system at the time and my friends and family would encourage me to try to talk more. So I did not recover just from the help I received in therapy, it was a lot of other things as well, but therapy helped a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Do you have any family history of SM?\n\nMy father has never been diagnosed but we are very similar and from what I have heard, he definitely seems to have had SM symptoms when he was younger. I believe my father's side of the family has a lot of anxiety problems but I am not sure if any of them have SM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; At first, I resented my mom a bit for not trying harder to find a therapist after my first one left. I feel quite bad about that now. \n\nI think a lot of parents struggle with any sort of disorder their child may have, especially something as rare as SM. My first psychiatrist tried to tell my mom that I had SM very early on, but she did not believe him. It took her a few years to really think about it and realize that I do have SM.  I would like to think if your mom had not passed, she would have likely began to understand better and try to help you out since you said she cared very deeply about you. I do not think she would hold it against you for ever resenting her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I am just curious about everyone is success rate, for those who received childhood treatment. It is always haunted me. \n\n I think its possible for you to still get help, no matter how old you are. For me, I needed a really good therapist and psychiatrist that were willing to try anything to help me out as well as a good support system. I have never heard of AvPD so I am not sure how similar/different treatment is compared to SM, but I hope you can recover from that someday. Sorry if I rambled a bit It seems like posting this was hard for you, but every time we do something hard it gets a little bit easier next time. I admire your bravery. I can relate to that feeling of resentment to some extent. I often feel like my childhood was stolen from me because my parents did not know how to deal with my SM. I am sorry for your loss. I try to remind myself they did not know any better and have been working on having a healthier relationship with them in the present.\n\nI am going to try to answer your questions. I received weekly therapy as a preteen that was completely ineffective. High school ended up being pretty traumatic and my mental health only got worse, so I ended up getting a thorough neuropsych evaluation at NYU. They recommended placing me in a residential treatment program for OCD and other anxiety disorders.\n\nI spent 4 and a half months there the summer of my 16th birthday doing CBT and exposure therapy. I ended up fully recovering from SM. After a couple of months there, I was able to say my first word. I had to be able to say \"help\" to go on a waterpark trip for safety reasons. I spent over an hour in my therapist's office trying to push the word out of my mouth. Once I said it, nothing bad happened. I was free. And from there, I was able to fully recover.\n\nNo family history of SM, but my mom reports being very quiet as a child. I have ASD and that does run in my family, which makes the risk of having an anxiety disorder much higher. I think it is reasonable to say my SM likely developed due to a mix of genetic and environmental factors. I got sent to the school counselor a few times in 4-6th grades. In elementary school, I mostly just remember her telling me to talk more. Super helpful /s. I really do not think she knew anything about SM. The counselor in 6th grade was better. I do not think it helped really, but he basically just talked and let me sit quietly. I do not think he said anything about me not talking, he just talked to me like I was normal, which was sort of nice even though any attention directed at me still stressed me out.   \n\n\nI have never been diagnosed with AvPD, but I think I lean that way some now. I am definitely a quiet person and have a lot of social anxiety, but I have not gone to a psychiatrist so idk. I do not think anything anyone did when I was a kid helped much and I definitely resent a lot of people who could/should have done more. My parents were the source of a lot of my issues, so it is not like I expect them to have gotten me help for the abuse they were inflicting, but the teachers and all who just thought I was stupid or bad and did nothing makes me sad/mad. What is AvPD? You know, it is very normal for kids to resent their parents at times.  And it is very  normal for parents to resent their kids at times.  I have a good relationship with my teen, and work very hard to keep it that way, even when it is messy and painful.  But we still resent each other at times.  Once you are out of the teen years and gain perspective as an adult, it is a lot easier to forgive that stuff and switch your focus to appreciation.  If you did not make it out of your teen years before this happened, it is not a burden to carry with you for the rest of your life.  You are allowed to forgive yourself.  I am sure your mom would want you to forgive yourself.  You can love her now, and appreciate her now, and not burden yourself with past actions.\n\nI hear you about the psychologist, lol.  I have a therapist, and so far, I think I do more listening to her than she does help me.  \n\nYou should not feel embarrassed about receiving disability.  It is very hard for many of us to function in this built world.  If I were to design it, it would be very different, and in such a way that people like us could thrive.  You are doing the best you can, and there is no reason to feel embarrassed.  I have had a terrible time with finding jobs I can tolerate, and it is only now at age 46 that I can say that I love what I do.\n\nMy son is doing well, and I am very thankful.  I was the breadwinner for my family for several years, and now my husband and I have switched roles.  It has allowed me to be his therapist as well as teacher, and he is making great strides.  I can never go back and relive my childhood to make it better.  I can only pay it forward, which I hope I have done.  :)\n\n((((hugs))))) This is sort of what happened to me, yeah. The origin of my problem? Autistic with the theory of mind of a potato. So my \"social disability\" is quite profound compared to my intellect. I have learning disabilities that make it kind of like I do not have a first language, if that makes sense. Left unacknowledged, this ofc became extreme social anxiety, to the point of developing bouts of agoraphobia starting in elementary school. My brain did backflips trying to cope, and my personality became all fucked up trying to adapt. It has progressed into me being completely isolated and avoidant. But I am doing better and there is hope. Just wanted to say you are not alone in this sort of projectory. In basic terms, it is a severe social anxiety disorder. The Wikipedia page for it does a WAY better job at describing it than I would ever be able to.\n\n Thank you for the link. I understand your post better now. I do not know how old you are. I am currently 35 and when I beat my selective mutism, I was 23. My mom never sent me to therapy but I went by myself when I was around 18. It took me a while to find a good therapist who was able to finally help me. Others have said I was avoiding and aggressive, depressed and had social phobia. I do not know about all these labels. My therapist who helped me, did not make a big deal out of labels but was only interested in helping me. And he did. It took a lot of practicing but I was finally break the vicious cycle of not being able to talk. I am just sharing my story and I hope it helps a little. Today I have no more selective mutism. Oh, and therapy did not do shit, lol! I consider myself a psychiatric survivor because my disabilities were pathologized as mental illness from a young age, and I spent most of my life in lazy, irresponsible therapies. I was medicated for anxiety starting from age 12 (Celexa, Zoloft, benzodiazepines) instead of being given treatment for trauma and PTSD. But I guess it was better than ABA? I actually do not think any psychiatric or behavioural therapies are up to par with the needs of autistics and other folks with SM. They just forced me to talk, which was very damaging. I think at the time they saw SM as a symptom of sexual abuse, which was also happening, but I needed wayyy more help than being forced to talk about it. Now I have zero trust. From my personal experience, therapy made a huge difference in my life. i started super young (kindergarten i think) and went for probably a few years. got prescribed sertraline. progress was slow, but i was lucky to have been placed into therapy so young and to have a family that supported me and i even had a friend in kindergarten. i dont think i talked to her though. i can freely talk to anyone now (i am 20) but i am still on sertraline (and xanax on very rare occasions) but i do find myself more socially awkward at times around people i am uncomfortable with and i cannot really talk about very deep feelings or troubles even with people i am close to. i still have general anxiety so i think it is partly that, but even if i never had SM i think i would still be a more shy person. as of now after leaving high school i do not really have that many friends any more, so i find myself out of practice socially which is scary and makes everyday things like going to stores more stressful, but i hope to start putting myself around people more often after this pandemic. \n\nAll around therapy helped me a lot, but i am not 100% and i do not know if i ever will be, but i am grateful for where i am at because i know it could be much worse. For you i would suggest therapy if you can :) talk to your doctor and see what you can work out. also i really suggest to hang out with friends(online for now lol). i know it can feel easier sometimes to stay home but i think it is especially important for people with social anxiety to stay social. it is never too late to start therapy even if you did not get it immediately when you felt like you needed it :) best wishes!\n\n(edit) i forgot to mention but early on i never talked to my therapist, but i moved on to whispering to them and i think i talked to them towards the end. it is hard to remember since it was so long ago. Apologies for the late reply! I am 30 now. I am going to have this for the rest of my life (AvPD). I have accepted that this is just who I am. My amygdala is an asshole \ud83e\udd23.\n\nI have seen a dozen therapists and psychiatrists and the best they can help with is making my panic attacks slightly less terrible, between meds and coping/grounding techniques that barely work.\n\nI have tried basically every anxiety medication under the sun, and the only ones that usually help are short-acting stuff like Xanax, etc.\n\nI am so proud of you! You overcame an extremely difficult condition (SM) and that, from my perspective, is MIND-BLOWING to me!!!!", "I have seen no one else make a post about this problem with trying to get better So I am 14 have SM, but I am trying to get better, and I have the problems with getting better which everyone talks about, but I also have a problem with just thinking it is weird to suddenly go to school talking after almost 5 years of not. If anyone is wondering why I only stopped talking entirely at school at 9, that is a story for another time.\n\nAnyway, does anyone have any advice for this problem? Yeah same I find that humor helps me get out of my shell. It lightens the tension and people love to laugh. OH im 14 too!!! i started talk slightly in school and people were really surprised. I feel like they become surprised, but would get use to it? With me with my friends i would never say a word to them AT ALL but after a while i started talking! I feel like they would be surprised by it at first, but after a while they would get use to it. For me personally they didnt ask why I started talking out of nowhere, they just accepted it and moved on. I am 14 as well, I understand what your going though I have never really talked a school but it did to more before I was 8 and then 9 like the same time as you I stoped talking to pretty much everyone in school except like a friend. lol like the first time I have ever \u201chere\u201d when the teacher called names was last year. And it felt good and sometimes I regretted doing in the first place because what if I sounded wired saying it or just because some stupid reason. But it worth it. I also starred talking to some other kids in my class And sometimes when teachers asked questions I would respond after they would call on me. I think the best thing to remember is just do not think to much about it. I am a 15 y/o recovered SM and I felt the same way when I first wanted to get better. I was only able to talk to people who did not make a big deal out of it, they just accepted it as something normal and did not treat me like the odd one out. I recovered when I started middle school because it gave me a clean slate. Nobody knew who I was, nobody knew how quiet I was, they just heard me talk and thought it was normal so it was easy for my talking to be accepted, the hard part was just getting used to talking. If you want that \u201cit is going to be weird if I suddenly start talking\u201d feeling to go away, my main advice would be to look for a clean slate to practice with. If you meet new people, act like you have been talking your whole life and they will be none the wiser because that is normal for other people. If you are not in high school yet, take advantage of being a new kid when you are.\n\nIf you do not have a clean slate, the best advice I can give you is to ease into talking. Maybe say a few words a week, then make it a couple words a day. If you are doing online school, talk in the chat in class and work up the nerve to unmute when you can. Do not go all in at the beginning unless you are comfortable with a million people freaking out over your talking; start out small and work your way up to more socialization so people will not be surprised that you are talking at all. I got better at the age of around 14. I asked my parents if it could she a Psychiatrist and he prescribed me anti anxiety meds. It was terrifying but I got a job as a hostess and also one at the hospital volunteering. I would have to answer phones at the hospital (age 15) and was so scared of miss-spelling. The anxiety meds helped. I lived in FL and pretended I was living in California and that no one knew me as well. I wish I would enjoyed not taking and spent more time studying. I am just now starting school for pre-med 10 yrs later because I did really enjoy working in the hospital all thru high school. It is called exposure therapy. If you get too nervous write on paper the exact convo u want w your parents and then doctor. I fully got over it at around 19 but was functional at age 16", "r/selectivemutism traffic summary March 2019 Here are some traffic statistics for r/selectivemutism this month:\n\n\n\nTraffic by day - the jumps are probably because of certain posts made in r/aspergirls, r/aspergers, and r/komi_san.

", "Want to learn more about sm for a friend I do not know if I can post this but I still want to try.\n\nSo I know this girl at my school who I have a crush on. I always just thought she was reserved. I did not know until last night but she told me that she is recovering from selective mutism. I know my fair share of mental health (brother has autism, I have anxiety and ADHD) but I was completely stumped when it came to this.\n\nI value our friendship more than anything else, and I would rather get advice from people who have dealt with SM first hand than articles (they help, but only to an extent).\n\nFor the record, we are both 15\n\nThank you in advance What advice are you looking for? Advice on how I can talk to her without putting her in a situation where she feels unsafe. Also just insight into the viewpoint of someone with SM It probably depends on the person more than the illness. There is not a universal truth to how people will feel. First off, I just want to say it is really awesome that you came here to better understand and help her. And as sort of a disclaimer, please know that not everyone with SM is the same, and every person with SM has their own preferences and things they are comfortable/uncomfortable with. But I will try my best.\n\nThe most important thing when talking to someone with SM is to ask *yes/no* questions that they can nod their head to, rather than more open ended questions that require a verbal response. If the SMer you are speaking to happens to be somewhat verbal, you can ask very direct questions that only require a few words in response. If it requires a longer response they will have a harder time being able to respond. \n\nAnother important thing to note is that *selective mutism is not voluntary by any means*. In short, selective mutism is an anxiety disorder where someone experiences such severe anxiety in social settings (school, work, family gatherings, parties, everyday errands, etc) that they find themselves unable to speak/communicate. They are typically able to speak and communicate freely in a setting where they are comfortable, secure, and relaxed, such as at home. Selective mutism is anxiety based, thus, any pressure to speak will make them much more anxious and make it even harder for them to speak. Keep away the \u201cexpectation of speech\u201d as much as possible, and stick to direct and yes/no questions like I talked about above.\n\nRegarding an article to read, I recommend this one:  Thank you so much for your response. Even before I knew about her SM I tried sticking to y/n questions because I could see that she does not like being verbal. I will be sure to look into the article right away! &gt;I could see that she does not like being verbal\n\nRemember, it is not that she does not *like* to be verbal and intentionally chooses to not be, it is that she literally cannot speak. When I am in a setting where I cannot speak, I can form the words in my head, but no matter how hard I try I cannot say them. The words just feel \u201cstuck\u201d in my throat. And if I ever try to speak, no sound comes out. This is because people with SM experience paralyzed vocal cords when they cannot speak. Their vocal cords unparalyze and they can speak once they leave and get into a setting where they are comfortable and not anxious. \n\nHopefully now you can see that selective mutism is completely out of the sufferers control. Yeah, I understand that. I guess I just worded it wrong it is good of you to try to be kind to her. highschool was hard with SM. be comfortable with her not talking, write with her (having a notebook that just you two write in can bring you closer. it is how i became best friends with my talker friend in HS). also things like talking to her normally, making it clear she does not have to speak if she does not want to, ect.\n\nask her how she feels and what she would like, ultimately, but being open and normal around her is a very good start. good luck.", "I found a manga about a high school girl with SM! It is called Komi Cannot Communicate. Even though it is not explicitly stated that she has SM it is possible to assume she does, as the character has a social anxiety disorder and is unable to talk to others in certain situations! Here is the plot:\n\nOn her first day attending the elite Itan Private High School, the main setting of the story, Shouko Komi immediately receives an overwhelming surge in popularity due to the unprecedented, stoic beauty and refined elegance her classmates perceive her to possess. However, only Hitohito Tadano, an exceedingly average schoolboy assigned to the seat next to hers, is able to have the opportunity to discover that, behind her bish\u014djo appearance, Komi has serious issues in communicating with others. Tadano sets out to help Komi on her quest to find 100 friends.\n\nAn absolute beauty to anyone, Shouko Komi in reality suffers from extreme social anxiety and communication problems, making her largely unable to talk to others. However, her attractiveness and stoic appearance (which in itself results from her anxiety) is perceived as refined class, making her highly popular while preventing people from actually getting to know her. Komi's first conversation with Tadano is over a blackboard, and she uses a notebook to convey her feelings through writing. Despite this, she is still capable of verbal conversation over a cell phone. Her dream is to overcome her communication problems and make 100 friends.\n\nThis manga is ongoing and currently has 215 chapters. I thought some of you might be interested. You cannot post and not link it:  sksjdjjwjdjje sorry i totally forgot Sounds interesting. I am always happy when we get some representation in media. Have you ever heard of Goodnight Punpun? It is a manga series where the main character never speaks except for inside his head or almost inaudibly. I love Punpun but I think it is more like a Zelda situation where he speaks but the dialogue is never shown. I will have to check it out! It is been a while since I read I think the main character of Hibi Chouchou has SM as well. I remember feeling like I could relate to her so much. I remember the way people treated her not being realistic though. I think it is true that he does speak but it is rare. Other characters often comment about how quiet he is or he is yelled at for not speaking or asked to speak up. At least that is the case in the first few books. I have not read the remaining yet. I haaave too check this out. Thank you so much.! I have it ordered for my daughter.  Hope it will be useful!  Thank youl Thank you for that recommendation!\nSuper interested now :) I like it a lot, and my daughter does too. i am so happy that you guys love it!! Thank you so much!! Definitely giving this a read! Hitohito Tadano is a Japanese play on words that means \u201cjust a person\u201d, and Komi is probably short for communication in Japanese! Late comment but I was so surprised to find this manga because Komi was a lot like me, SM and hairstyle and all. I really loved it, and little-girl-me would have loved it even more to see a manga character to relate to.\n\nIt is really funny and uplifting, the romance is cute too. Would definitely recommend.\n\n(I actually found this subreddit when I mentioned my SM at the Komi subreddit) you came full circle \ud83d\udc9e", "Help for my daughter My daughter of 9 has SM.  She was diagnosed 3 years ago.  She has been in therapy and it is helping, but she will go all day at school without saying a word.  Are there any groups she can join such as a Toastmasters for children? I posted this tweet here a while ago: \n\nThis person benefited a lot from speech and drama classes for kids. Every kid is different though so be sure to pay attention to your daughter's needs and be there to support and advocate for her if its necessary.\n\nIf it is too much for her I think that any classes that can bring her confidence up will be of help, regardless  of what it is about. Such as horse riding (animals are proven for their therapeutic effects), or martial arts. The boost to her confidence will make leaps and bounds of difference when it comes to reducing her anxiety outside. Has she been evaluated by an SLP? Speech therapy (in combination with her current counseling of course) could help her learn strategies to use with peers. Plus, it is literally an SLP\u2019s job to illicit language! What is an SLP? A Speech-language Pathologist. My daughter was diagnosed around the same age.  She benefited greatly from working with horses - riding and taking care of them.  Barn was the first place I heard her speak up.  \n\nShe is 19 now and doing well.  I can share more if you are interested. Medication is a great option.  Freeze is a hard reaction to shake loose even with great therapy. Thank you.  Yes, please do. What medication?  Stimulants or ssri\u2019s? All of this is just a parent's perspective - not advice.\n\nShe is our first child, oldest of 3 and the only one with the condition.  \n\nIt all started in Kindergarten: diagnosis, shock, confusion.  \n\nShe is a typical, loud kid in some environments, but will not talk in other places.  School is a quiet place for her. She would talk to me in the car on the way to school and stop as soon as we get there.  She would whisper to me at the school, as long as others could not see that she could speak.  We did countless sessions with professionals. We had a school psychologist and speech therapist work with her individually.  We would spend time with her at school after hours so she could read to us, while the teacher set across the room.   \n\nSome teachers would not believe that she is capable of speaking.  Others blamed it on her bilingualism. Her written assignments were always getting good grades and for verbal ones, we went with recording her on video.  On a couple occasions the recordings were shown to the class with her permission.\n\nAll the professionals who specialized in SM (very few around Chicago at the time) would follow the same playbook in therapy until coming to the same conclusion: medication.  We did not want to take this route, since there were no studies of long term effects and the potential side effects seemed too risky.\n\nAt some point, we stumbled on a summer camp with horses.  At that time, any new/unknown environment would automatically become a quiet place for her.  Not the barn.  She would yell to other kids there.  That was interesting, but we did not know how to translate that into a school environment.  Nevertheless, it gave us hope that things were changing.  Naturally, we made sure she was around horses and other animals often.  \n\nThe other interesting thing was that she loved to perform in front of people as long as she did not have to use her voice.  She danced and played an instrument.  She was not particularly gifted, but enjoyed the process, so again, we pushed her into doing more of those things.\n\nDuring those years she attracted a specific type of kid: someone who would speak for her and \u201ctake care\u201d of her (she would whisper to them).  For some reason, those kids became very possessive of her, and any attempt to make new friends would result in bullying.  \n\nNothing really improved until grade 6.  First, it was a middle school transition.  Kids were brutal.  It was rough.  It was becoming clear that she was ready to open up, but many of her elementary school friends were there, and knew her as the non-verbal kid.  This was a pattern she would not change.\n\nThis is when, against everyone is advice, we made a decision to move her to a completely new school district mid year.  She did have a 504 plan, but we did not tell her that the teachers knew anything about it.  She did a presentation in front of her new class a couple of weeks later. I cried.  This was the breakthrough we have been hoping for.  Things improved overnight.  \n\nThings are \u201cnormal\u201d now.  She is in college, works customer service jobs and functions just like any normal teenager.  She is definitely an introvert.  And she is still in therapy, learning to control her emotions and concentrate better.  \n\nThis entire experience was a huge struggle for us.  I know how frustrated you must feel.  I hope you find something positive to look forward to in my story. Thank you so much for this.  I am very happy for the progress she has made.  This exactly where we are right now.  Your story lines up with ours.  We are planning to get her more involved with external activities. This is very interesting that you say that. \n\n After being forcibly adopted by a stray cat at 14 I DID start to socialize a lot more with people. \n\nThe next year  my (Human) bestie decided we were going to be friends and Well... that was also really helpful for socializing with humans. That is awesome.\n\nHow is your life now?  Would you call yourself cured or recovered?  Are you still struggling?  \n\nIt was very difficult to image what my daughter's adult life would be like.  Now I can see her having a pretty normal life, but 10 years ago I saw it in pretty dark colors. Depends on what the prescriber feels is the best fit and if there are other diagnoses but typically SSRI's like Zoloft or Prozac.\n", "My Selective Mutism \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Hi everyone,\nIt is my first time trying to find an answers to help me online so be nice plz\n\nI have selective mutism since i was 13 which is rare to have it getting older but it was at that time when it is really affected me, and now i am 22 sadly \nMy big problem is I have it at home + when i am around my dad :( \nThe thing is I love my dad so much and I really want to have a conversation with him \ud83d\udc94\n\nAny helpful advice?

I think before meeting that girl, maybe a week before I was starting to breakdown a bit...I actually cried in the Outback for no decipherable reason.......but after meeting her, that is when I really started to breakdown, I would be on the couch laying/crying all day.....eventually telling my Mom some more key things about my SM which she has never realized.  I think it was all coming down to that realization eventually, just maybe not that soon....anyway, that is ranting. I could go on and on.\n\nNow I just browse r/teenagers all day, and this sub...and watch a select few YouTube videos...although I watch ones now that are about bettering yourself, like Ted Talks and stuff....in the past, that was a rare thing for me, but I will sit through a whole 30minute one at night. \n\nAlso I know you guys probably know my story already, since I post a lot (my last post being the latest on the sub before this one..) but yeah....this is just the best place to discuss anything for me, the discord I do not find it too helpful to discuss SM on. I repeated that, but...thanks. I go now. \n\nAlso I encourage everyone to post more if you can. It is always nice seeing other's insights on everything and anything. I used to never want to meet anyone like me, but here I am now lol. I met my current boyfriend. Before, I talked to absolutely no one outside of family. Honestly, we just sat together in silence and communicated by text for the first few months after we met. He was fine with that. I really wanted to speak to him though and I let him know that. I asked him not to be surprised if I spoke to him, and not to expect anything. And eventually I did end up speaking to him, and got really comfortable. And while I still cannot talk to people who used to know me as \"the one who does not talk\", I am able to speak in majority of situations now.\n\n(Also I did not know there was a Discord, I will hop in now :3) I am exactly the same with the not being able to talk to people in front of people you can talk to, but can talk to them pretty normally on your own. Obviously it is not easy still but I can usually force myself into talking to strangers when I need to when my family is not there, but as soon as there is someone watching me I just cannot get the words out and when I do I either feel like I am going to cry or actually cry. I never knew other people experienced that specifically until this post so thanks :) Yeah, that is BIG for me and my Dad. That is something that I still have not disclosed to them, the reaction is killer. And I appreciate it, but when I talk one word and then he says \"I am proud of you,\" it feels like me talking is not normal and something to celebrate. To me, talking is not that serious. I need to relay that.\n\nI think the biggest problem with me pursuing this girl that I met, is that my Mom was the one who got her number. And the night I met her, I did not talk to her because I was with my family. It was a very odd experience (it is pinned on my profile, since I rant).....Meeting up with a girl or even asking my Mom for her number is not something I can just do, and that is where the problem is. I do not let my family know I want those things, although they will talk in passing about them to me, how I would be a great husband/father (my Mom says from time to time).......My Dad who has been the most supportive of me meeting up with her, he will bring it up every now and again, I can never even nod my head yes, I just do not give an answer, but unlike my Mom who would interpret that answer as a 'yes'...he will interpret it as a 'I am not interested.'\n\nI really need to discuss the reaction aspect, which you would think they would know about...but I guess it is hard if you do not have it. They are seeing a psychiatrist to try and get better insight on how to help me, which will eventually lead to me going on medication, but that is not what I need. Although I may \"take the medicine\" to rid of that reaction aspect, I could just fall back on the medicine doing that to me, and tell them 10 years down the line \"Oh, yeah I literally never took the medicine.\"\n\nI also feel like I do not know my true personality or how to truly express myself currently, and I want to figure that out. Idk, it is a lot. I know I am dropping a lot of text here.\n\nAnd the other day I was at my Uncle's house and my dad told them I was going to say hi, and in that moment I planned on it before, but in the moment the Uncle is laughing because they do not understand the scope of myself and I did not, though physically and mentally I am much more comfortable in my family's and Extended's presences. I think me just randomly saying Hi mid-convo they were having would have been easier.\n\nI also want to do more things on my own, like go on random drives in my car....or on my bike...or say I want to buy a motorcycle (because I really want one)....I am 18 so I could, but I do not have a job...I am in limbo after my 1st year of college...and I would have to have them apy the insurance/gas....I mean I would pay it if I had job though....so that is why I would have to ask....plus the license process...and I am just laying a lot down here once again. I will stop for now. Honestly I am definitely nervous when talking to strangers alone still, but there is no real issue there otherwise. I actually picked pizza up last week alone, and I spoke to the cashier but I could not speak to him until I got to the counter because I am not used to projecting my voice like that (he was talking to me as soon as I walked in the door), although I skipped out on any 'non-to the point' talk, I felt good after.\n\nIf I go back to college this coming year, I plan to speak in class. I hope there is mics so it is easier. From there I hope to get used to it. The stigma for me is the worst part about SM, I wish the people that knew I did not talk, could forget I could not talk.\n\nTo me, SM was more of a developed thing. Initially it was this extreme shyness, but overtime I grew into it and in 6th grade is when I fully committed to it, since I did not talk in school (although I had my friends, I did talk to). I never presented....but in 7th grade I talked in front of the health class because that health teacher did not expect me not to speak, so I did. That was the first and last time I spoke like that in MS and HS. Those people knew me as the one that did not talk, which made it hard. If I went in there now, I think I would dip into talking. There is not a 14th grade to go back into though lol. I always think how I wish I did not stop talking in 6th grade, but started to more...I was always quiet and never found the need to talk, but I did not have that stigma associated with me yet. For family, in 2011 I have videos and I am conversating with my brother which I have no recollection of otherwise.......I think that grew from 6th grade too, that was really the true downfall into my SM, it was when it started being heavily personified to my own person. Yep, the reaction is pretty much why I could not say a word for my six years of middle and high school, since they were with the same crowd. And it is also why I cannot get myself to talk to people who expect me not to talk. Whenever someone said they were proud of me for talking, it made me feel horrible because it just really brings out the fact that I do not talk usually onto the stage.\n\nI get how hard it is to tell them, it is hard to tell my mom or dad about things I want, and it is hard for me to express any form of emotion or desire for something around them. Even when I got into my university program after working super hard, and was incredibly happy, I just told them in a passing way.\n\nI felt that way about my true personality back then too. I was just an emotionless shell so I barely knew who I was. I cannot speak for everyone, but for me it developed on its own - at the beginning of my recovery I never really said much but as I talked more and more, I began to scrape away that wall that I built up all my life. That being said, I still rotate between personalities depending if I am serious or not, happy or not, tired or not, but it is a start. And while I know how to act like \"myself\" with my boyfriend, I am not so sure I know how to act around anyone else.\n\nIt is good that they are seeing a psychiatrist to try and help. And I felt the same way about medicine, it kind of scares me to not make the change myself. Blaming it on medicine is definitely a solution though haha\n\nAnd I want to do normal things too. I spent my whole life cooped up in my home playing the piano so I just want to do things. Everyday for years I tried coaching myself into talking, when I did people stared and listened closely. I hated that, when I started talking a lot no one listened to me. I realized people listen to you when you never talk and theres power in that. \n\nI started talking because of a combination of things. Someone called me mysterious and enigmatic and said no one knows anything about me and that hurt. \n\nA classmate I knew for years and admired but never spoke to killed himself. I sat next to him that year and it killed me to know I never talked to him for 10 years. \nI know it would not have changed anything if I spoke to him though. \n\nI wanted to be able to answer phones at work and be more helpful. \n\nI wanted to be able to go places by myself, I remember the first time I went to the mall by myself. It was Christmastime and I felt so proud of myself. \n\nI wanted people to know things I am thinking and would say if I could because I missed out on so much. I wanted friends and a social life. I wanted everything I could not have if I continued to be silent so I forced myself to talk. \n\nWhen I forced myself to talk, I was so loud and obnoxious and this was during a very vulnerable point in life. I just graduated high school and was facing what to do with life, a few people had died in my life and I was dealing with trauma from childhood. I knew no social boundaries as I am autistic. I went from completely silent to a loud mouth crazy maniac. Then after a year of loudness, I realized I forgot that I was ever mute. I ignored that side of me completely and forgot where I came from and what shaped me. When I realized this I was able to balance my talking and balance my emotions better. I still have trouble with social situations but I am able to respond and I am so proud of myself. It was 6th grade for me when I fully committed to not speaking in school as well, and  I should have expressed myself that year. That is when I feel into the SM fully. I was so nervous about new people at the time, and not being the biggest speaker already from my original Elementary school...I committed to that. \n\nI actually just told my Mom since she is ironically the easiest to communicate to that it is the reaction to when I speak, good or bad. Although we probably get along the most combatively. My Dad would be the hardest (I am probably repeating myself)....I read through your reply, but then kinds got lost when my Mom was talking to me.\n\nI feel like maybe I want this girl too because I feel like maybe then, I would be my 'true self.' \n\nAnd today I was sitting in the kitchen, and it came to me that I am associated with this 'SM,' and I do not want to be...although that is me. My wish is to be done with it all at least majorly by the end of the summer/year....and definitely before I turn 19 (which is a little under 4 months) . I think I can do it. Funnily enough, I was one of the loudest in my elementary school (my problem back then was solely talking to teachers and adult figures). Selective mutism is so hard to go through and the anxiety is still prevalent, especially now that I am partaking in job interviews. I hate associating myself with it too, but yep, it is me! \n\nAnyways, I hope everything goes well for you! Good luck, I believe in you! In a way, I feel like when I am in very social situations I lose the rational side of my personality. I kind of hate myself when I do, so I like to take a step-back from them (be it I am not talking..but if I am the center of attention in like class or something, when I was in HS/MS).....and yeah I would LOVE to go somewhere, just anywhere on my own time, on my own will. I am 18, have a car, and I just do not. I would love to just drive around for an hour or two by myself listening to music, exploring.\n\nWhen you started to speak, what was the timeframe from silent to 'loud mouth?' In my mind I could just say F it, one day...and be done. Although I would be wrecked mentally.....but in the end I am sure I would be better off. \n\nI also feel like if I do speak loudly, that would I would be speaking too loudly because I do not know how to control my volume like that, that well. \n\nAnd yeah, no one really knows anything too much about me, not my friends, not my family. No one. Maybe that is why I am so distraught ever since I came across this girl, in a way she would be the escape from that. You would be able to be yourself....although not right away since that is a maybe if that would even ever go anywhere relationship wise, if I do speak well......I have confidence in my ability though, I just do not know how well I actually execute it all. In a way its sort of the committing to a new life too, and thank you. Oh yeah, the only one I spoke normally to in the school was my Nurse, because they did not know who I was. I would speak so normally, although it would still be odd for me since I never get the opportunities to speak to anyone, even if I can. This is so similar to me it is literally like I have written it myself. In school was definitely my worst time because people from my primary school(I am from the uk I am assuming your from the us so in case you do not know what it is just basically before I was 11) knew me when my SM was worst, so throughout the whole of secondary school I never got the chance to change that because the people I knew when I was younger told everyone \u2018oh she does not really speak\u2019 or \u2018do not bother speaking my to her she will not really answer\u2019 so I ended up being able to speak confidently with very few people and I could not speak in class without pretty much having a breakdown after, I still have no idea why I could just have spoken and accepted that other people knew my sm was better. So the first chance I got I left there and went to college (again probably not the same college as youre talking about but here we have the choice of staying at school till we are 18 or going to college from 16-18), and honestly it was the best thing I have probably ever done, I still struggle a lot but in my college class it was a completely fresh start because no one knew me from when I was younger so there was no expectations or anything, and now I have done a few presentations and made friends and can actually speak in class when I know the answer to something, which I never would of been able to do if people from my old school or family would of been there Also I just read another one of your comments about your parents reacting to you speaking, another thing I am exactly the same with, I get they are proud and just want me to be more confident but I hate when they(and other people, which is probably why I cannot speak in front of people from when I was younger who thought I did not) make a point out of it, it just makes me feel uncomfortable and I do not really know how to explain it \u201ccannot talk to people who used to know me as \u2018the one who does not talk\u2019\u201d  omg I feel you!! I met my sister\u2019s boyfriend when I did not talk and years later it is really hard to talk to him, especially when my sister is around.", "first day at school ", "Inspirational movie based on real story Just bumped on the movie - 'Front of the class'\n\n\n\nIt is true story of Brad Cohen - a kid with tourrette syndrome who went on to become highly successful teacher.\n\nI recommend this movie to both adults with SM and to SM parents. There are so many things which we can relate. The struggles and difficulties shown in the movie are almost same as what we go through.\n\nReally inspiring story. There is also speech from real Brad Cohen which is equally inspiring (more effective if you watch the movie first):\n\n", "Sharp Shouting Shapes: Selective Mutism - Natasha Dale ", "I prefer being nonverbal. Is that weird? I have had SM since I was a kid. Verbal communication is both painful and draining for me. I get by fine with asl and a few select apps on my phone. I can talk just fine at hone with my SO but we will still sign things like \u201cI love you\u201d back and forth.\n\n I am honestly fine this way and do not see the need to put in the time and energy to be \u2018cured\u2019 just so I can have verbal conversations with people I do not care about. Am I the odd one out? I like your resolve.  Plus there is too many people to keep track of. I do not see anything weird about that. I have days where speaking just takes energy I do not have. I am able to force myself when needed but I wish it was more acceptable to opt out of talking. Mine started with disability but now I feel like I got used to being nonverbal and mostly prefer it whenever I can. I wish schools were more understanding of this and put a writing essay option instead of presentation. I would be happy as a pig in mud if I never had to speak again. So glad I have friends where we can message back and forth on discord while sitting next to each other and it be completely normal. I like this a lot, it would certainly take a lot of stress out of our days! \ud83d\udc4d Nothing wrong with that, I feel the same about it too. I feel more at piece when I do not speak (definently need to work on my asl though so I can speak with my partner and my loved ones when I am mute). It is hard to balance this, because to a degree I think encouraging people with gentle pressure to step outside of their boundaries is a healthy thing that helps you grow. That being said, yes, I do think a large number of people are unaware or sympathetic towards people with SM and will likely assume you are making excuses to get out of presenting", "Do people still treat you badly in adulthood? Do other adults react to your mutism like you are stupid or not talking on purpose and become mean to you? If so, how do you deal with it? Laughing usually, not always in the moment, depending on how I feel I will either deadpan (my favorite) or just smile.\n\nUsually people are offended or think I do not speak English (ethnically unclear looking). Adults were usually more confrontational about my mutism in my experience, and would berate me for being rude or ignoring them. From younger kids I just got stares. Not quite as much, but some still do. I had a few college friends who started disliking me because they thought I was being rude by not talking to them more.", "Selective Mutism or Social Anxiety I have never felt like I had a lot of the traditional symptoms of social anxiety, but I do feel like I have mental blocks in some social situations that prevent me from coming up with anything to say. (Although it does not  physically prevent me from speaking)\n\nGrowing up there were certain situations where I would never talk. For example I played ice hockey during high school and I never talked... ever. I do not remember how I felt about talking, but I just remember not engaging with people. Our coach gave out \u201cmock awards\u201d, which were comical awards meant to make fun of people in good sprit. I won the \u201cHellen Keller\u201d award because I never talked in the four years I played.\n\nNow at the age of 25 I have a lot of problems with communication in certain situations. When I am surrounded by friends in a familiar situation I am able to freely talk. However in other situations I feel like a part of my brain turns off, like there is something blocking me. It does not stop me from speaking, but it does stop me from being able to come up with anything to say to people. I go blank so I am unable think of anything to start or chime into a conversation. If people try to talk to me, I am able to give a one word response maybe ( \u201ccool\u201d, \u201cthat sucks\u201d, \u201cnice\u201d), but I cannot think of anything to say to continue the conversation. Again, it feels like there is something blocking me, or I go blank. It is like part of by brain turns off. I am also not able to focus in anything because half of my attention is focused internally, and the other half externally. \n\nI am not physically prevented from speaking. It is not like I have anything to say, but I am being blocked from talking. I am unable to come up with anything to say.\n\nIf I am in a loud or crowded places I usually have a bit of a sensory overload and I am unable to focus on anything. (I heard this could be a symptom). My friends say I look sad/have a blank expression on my face very often.\n\nBut anyway, growing up/ during my adolescence many people have described me as being a person who does not talk. It depended entirely on who I was surrounded by however. \n\nI do not say I have social anxiety because I do not fear social situations. I rarely think about rejection/how people perceive me in social situations. If i manage to say something I do not worry about how I was perceived.  I am just unable to think about anything in social situations; I tend to go blank. \n \nI want to stress that I am not physically unable to talk. And sometimes I do say a thing or two, or comment, but I rarely am able to engage in conversation in certain environments.\n\nWould this be selective mutism? I am just a bit confused because this is new to me. Thank you!!! I also wanted to point out that sometimes i find myself in situations where it is just easier to not talk. I do not feel anxious, or blank.  I was diagnosed with selective mutism at a very young age, i am now 18 and am coming near the end of my school life. I have no problem being in social atmospheres (as long as i do not stick out like a sore thumb) and have also been described as having a \"blank face\". However interacting and talking with people i am absoloutely terrible (except close friends and family). I try to avoid conversation as much as possible and when people speak to me first or ask a question, i always reply with the shortest, most standard answer. Eye contact is also a massive problem for me and i am frequently accused of ignoring people or being rude.\n\nAs of dealing with selective mutism, i do not know what to do with myself. I feel like over the last 10 years i have slowly been getting better at talking. However, in the last year or so i have been really struggling and can feel it getting worse again. This is because as i mentioned, it is my last year of school and next year will be either uni or a real job. So yeah i have that to look forward to i guess.\n\nAs for your situation, I can relate to a lot of things you have said in your post and would say that in my unprofessional opinion, you tick a lot of boxes for selective mutism. But hey, i am no expert, just a random on the internet. Hey, thank you for the response! I also have issues with eye contact. I will also take steps to avoid conversation.\n\nPerhaps university will turn out well for you. I managed to make friends with my roommate, and I met people through him. College was the one time in my life where I truly felt uninhibited by what I am now convinced is selective mutism. Unfortunately my friends graduated before me, and I spent my last year isolated. I lapsed back into selective mutism and have not seen much progress since.\n\nIt has never prevented me from getting a job. I nailed my interview because I never have a problem with talking when I feel like I have a script to follow. Making friends at work is an entirely different story. When I was younger and was diagnosed with SM, I had situations where I really wanted to talk but I just could not, I could not get a word out.\n\nNow I have mostly overcome SM as in I will talk if I have to (previously I would not even give short, one word answers) but when I am in a social situation I feel like you have desribed, mostly I do not have anything to add and have this mental block when I just do not know what to say when I am either directly confronted or in a group.\n\nDo not know if what you have desribed is SM but does not sound like social anxiety. Hmm, I but I also wonder how SM would manifest differently in adults than children. It is interesting that you said you were diagnosed with SM, and that you relate to some of the things I have described? Do you think it is possible it is affecting you differently as an adult? (Sorry, I am not trying to diagnose you. Just speculating :) ) Im the same as you, except i cant talk with friends nor family.... how are we supposed to live like this? I dont know about you but to me this fucking muteness kills my relationships and when i try to make friends they always believe that we dont talk because we have nothing in common... or when i successfully force myself to talk i talk with the mind of a 10 year old (awkward conversations) This is me exactly. I never have a problem getting in front of people and giving speeches or presentations if I know what to talk about, if I have a topic. But put me in a small group, and I can up. It is just like you said, having a script to follow.\n\nI was considered a very bright and hard-working student, and I never had problems asking or answering questions in class or reading alone. But I am very much an avoider. I avoid social situations where possible. I had trouble talking to my classmates one-on-one or in groups or with my teachers and other adults outside of the classroom, etc. I usually do not say a word the first few months or so at a new job until I get used to my new environment and coworkers. ", "Therapy is not for me Therapy does not seem to be working for me, but both my doctor and boss wants to keep going. No one knows how to help me. I am the only one who knows my boundaries, and I thought my communication was getting better anyway, but apparently it is not good enough for my boss. However, I have been affected by toxic masculinity, and pressure with working fast when the serving line gets busy and often times I need to catch my breath. Does anyone else have a hard time finding a therapist? I think everyone ever has had a hard time finding a therapist. It took me months taking the shotgun approach of meeting with everyone in my area covered by my insurance. Do not feel like you have to stick with one therapist. If you do not vibe with them off the bat then odds are you will never truly feel comfortable with them. I have gone to countless therapists and counselors from different states since I was little, and I found that Tracey Lee from LifeStance (formerly Granato Group) was the easiest to talk to, as she did not push too hard for details or make me speak on the phone when we had digital sessions (we texted). She was very sought after at the time, and I got lucky when she cleared days in her schedule for me, but I highly recommend checking her out if you are looking for someone who speaks gently and makes you feel like it is just a casual conversation.\n\n( Thank you! I will check her out.", "Finding Comfort In Anxiety I am 17 and started getting sm when I was 11 when i moved to a different country ,in a different a continent with a completely different culture so yeah. I cannot talk to anyone at my school teachers ,students anyone. It has been a wild ride for me as there is literally no one else like me at all. I have been mocked, belittled, laughed at constantly and there has yet to be anyone that has defended me like i have never had anyone stand up for me. This results in me skipping school a LOT like one day of every week i am skipping. I have no friends no future I cant stand up for myself at all. But in later years my anxiety has been my comfort like i am now content with my selective mutism and prefer not speaking and being ignored. Also does anyone else with sm suffer from maladaptive daydreaming its the only way i can get through the day by zoning out and pretending i am someone else. SORRY FOR PUNCTUATION ISSUES I\"M NOT FOREIGN I JUST CANNOT WRITE LOL It is hard, but yeah. Growing up I ALWAYS wanted a game that was 'real life,' but not. I always liked the sims and never playing it before, thought it was good....no the Sims is nothing close to what I want out of that kind of game, and it bores me.\n\nI want to change one day, but I do not think I will at this point.

I talked 3 different times to the guy or instructor in the car.....yea.......yea....and it was good.....all very low, and awkward...idk what he thought, he said my driving was good (although it was not but it was just much more aggressive than most, still sloppy) at first though he had a hard time hearing me......and before this all I was telling my dad something (one word, naming a car...600)....no fucking way he heard me, I am not dumb....He said 'cool' after me saying 600 very low....\n\nThere was this girl in the summer and I still cannot let go of that, although nothing will ever happen there.

I hope i can do that soon too :) We are just starting to video chat and I have myself on mute for now.. Great job!!!!!\n\nYou are more powerful than you realized.  Even if it is short, maybe you can try to schedule calls a few times a week so you can keep going with your success.", "Please help.. Anyone go selectively mute when being forced into a social situation? I am starting to give no fucks now..\n\nI was with a family member that is a tailor and doing deliveries, I made the mistake of going with her, and she kind of pushed me to go out and talk to her customers and all of them remember me from when I was a baby even though I do not remember them..... then her customer pushed me to come inside. I am silent, and stuck on my phone in their living room right now.... I am pissed as hell and want to lock myself in my room. Does not help that people perceive me as a child and talk to me condescendingly, speaking to me in a sing song voice.. I am literally (18. F) turning 19 in a few months and the girl who owned the house was like, she can play with my dog!!! And my family member goes, oh yeah she will like that. As if I was 4. I am over the day after this.\n\n\nI tried telling this family member how I felt and I was told that I was too sensitive. \n\nI am tired of being told I feel to much in a world that does not feel enough. Yes, definitely. Pressure to speak/communicate really makes everything much harder. When people pressure me to speak, I get even more anxious than I already am, and find it much harder to speak. That must have been awful. I am sorry to hear you had such a bad time. I have noticed that this (SM) is something that people find incredibly difficult to understand, I think that mostly it is due to a lack of trying to understand. I am sorry that you were told you are too sensitive. Your feelings are valid, even if they were too sensitive (they are not) you have every right to feel them. Your comment has made me feel so much better. Thank you for trying to see things in my perspective. Thank you for validating my emotions. It is incredibly frustrating when those closest to you do not really understand who you really are. We are misunderstood much too often. It feels ridiculous being almost 19 and still having meltdowns if I get overwhelmed, and struggling with such basic things.. but it is what it is.", "500+ research articles related to selective mutism - this database is incredible. ", "Exciting win for my son I just wanted to share a huge, surprising win we had this weekend. We went out of town on vacation, spent a day at the zoo, and then had dinner at my husband's friend's house with his family. My ASD SM son, 8 years old, walked in to this house he would never been in, with people he would never met, and yet he immediately started talking, playing, like he would known them his whole life. We were all in shock. Husband had warned them Son might be mute, or that he might use cards to communicate. Instead, Son rocked a new social situation. I am SO PROUD of him! I am hoping for more days like this. \u2764 But also, still making sure he knows no matter what, he is loved and we have got him. That is fantastic x Looooove hearing that!!! Thank you!!! That is great news! Hugs to all of you x I love that! So proud of your son!", "18 with sm I am almost 18 and still cannot even talk to my parents..\nSometimes I think I actually can talk to them, but I just never have, and I do not think it is me to talk to people. I just do not want them to think \u201cWhy is he talking now when he never does?\u201d It just bothers me. I hate being judged SO much that I cannot even do simple things properly like walking into the kitchen, It is like I am seeing myself from 3rd person, and I am seeing through their eyes. I always mess up and look like a clumsy idiot because I want to look as normal as possible. It feels like I forgot how to walk. \nI used to be able to talk to my dad, but since we moved, I did not see him as much and I never talked to him obviously. And once I go down, I cannot go back up. \nI cannot even do the things I want like going outside and sitting down to enjoy the outdoors, because I do not like anyone to think \u201cwhat is he doing?\u201d So here I am just sitting in my room all day without using my vocal chords ever, just stuck in my mind, in my room. \nI have tried therapy, but they all say the same thing.. \u201cWould it help you speak if I turned my back? Hur dur dur..\u201d Not even neurofeedback works which costs a ton. How the heck am I supposed to get a job or do anything in life? I am completely hopeless. You can get a dog and take him on walks I wonder how similar the experiences of a person with SM are.\n\nI also see myself from third person. I frequently forget how to walk and stand, and it makes my body go all wobbly and rigid. This was an actually insane feeling because in my middle school we had to stand for morning assembly, and I could just never stand still and it frustrated me.\n\nI second getting a dog. I have one, and I feel relaxed in her presence. They would also force you to take care of them outside so you would not have to stay in your room all the time. Idle time where you would head back to your room is replaced with playing with your dog.\n\nYou might also want to present your problem as an anxiety problem without saying selective mutism and try for anxiety medication. Medication helped me so much when I was growing up.  I started on Prozac when I was 8 and it made me feel comfortable enough to speak in therapy. It is something worth considering. It helps make the anxiety manageable enough so that treatment is easier to work on.  Hi, i have selective mutism too. I understand. I would love to chat with you if you want to! Hi yeah! How are you doing? I suffered from SM for over 10 years and bit by bit I managed to overcome it. If you would like to talk you can PM me. Hey. I have had a less severe version of everything you have described when I was younger and I still have some social anxiety. The only thing that I know of to fight anxiety is to do whatever it takes to deliberately face your fears, one at a time. I overcame Selective Mutism and it was the hardest thing I have ever done. Good luck to you. Do not lose hope! Feel free to ask me any specific questions you have. ", "/r/selectivemutism, what do you want to see on this subreddit? I have recently obtained modship over the subreddit, as the sole mod had long abandoned the sub. I do not suffer from selective mutism, but I have a friend who does, so I need your input.\n\n* What would you guys like to see on /r/selectivemutism? \n* Can we put together some sort of collection of resources? \n* What do you want to see stickied, or added to the sidebar? \n* What are you looking for when you visit this subreddit?\n* Does anybody want to make a snoo or have ideas for one?\n\nI reckon there are two types of people who come here: those with the condition, and those who are looking to learn about the condition, likely knowing someone who has it.\n\nI was very surprised to see how active the subreddit is, typically having a new post every day. I have learned quite a bit just looking around this subreddit, so thank you all. I have begun to add this subreddit to other related subreddits' sidebars (like /r/socialanxiety) in an effort to spread awareness to this obscure disorder. Let me know your thoughts. I feel like a list of resources would be an amazing place to start. A lot of questions seem to be about what SM is and while getting the answers from the horses mouth, so to say, is helpful when trying to understand such an obscure and hard to grasp disorder, I think some scholarly sources would be very beneficial. I have some that I have used to answer questions but I am not sure if you want me to link them in a comment or... idk, i am not good at this stuff.  Certainly, share everything you have got. I am just trying to grasp at the disorder myself. \n\n\n\nReally anything on the child mind institute website is very helpful and credible. I have personal experience with their treatments that I wrote about in a response a while back. I feel like encouraging people to talk about their experiences with treatment would be helpful in letting others know that seeking help should not be avoided and it is almost always worth the fear it causes.  I would like to hear about some of your experiences as children. ( or anyone in the same situation) Although my sons situation is a bit more complex. My son is 5 has Sm and also autism. Autism greatly effects his language already but his social anxiety is growing by the day. The first time he exhibited Sm was at the age of 3. a speech therapist would go to his preschool and he would not speak a word to her for 6 months straight. Yet he did speak in his typical preschool day. That all changed when he made the transition from preschool to kindergarten. He completely stop talk outside the home. Although anxiety has always been an issue for him now it is becoming debilitating. I have had to withdraw him from school and homeschool him. It is like he is an anomaly...autism resources have no idea how to help me and neither does Sm resources ( it is like one is afraid they do not have the knowledge of the other condition to help). Sorry to unload on here. I also have a 5 year old son with SM though he is not autistic he does have a rare genetic disorder which we believe plays a part in his SM. It has not been linked officially though the disorder does affect his development. It is called Okur-Chung Neurodevelopmental Syndrome. He has a micro deletion of chromosome 20p13. It is not widely known or studied but we are slowly growing the group. It was discovered around April 2016. Anyway, my son is like yours when speaking at home though he is not as clear which we attribute to the OCNDS. We are an active duty family and the struggle to find a specialist in SM has been a struggle especially here in Ohio. We have been taking him to speech therapy which initially made no progress. We have since switched to a different therapist and he has made so much progress in a little a bit of time. The therapist who have never dealt with SM have really dove into learning about it. We have met with a child physiologist who plans on working with the speech therapist to tag team his treatment. For the most part, both my wife and I encourage him to speak and try to sound his words out aloud and while trying to get him to not be nervous. I wish you the best in your journey with your little boy, we know how difficult it can be at times. I would like to read more about adults with SM. Most of the information on internet is about children with SM, but as an adult with SM myself, I would like to hear how others handle it. Thank you so much for sharing! I am so glad to hear you have found a team for your son. It is been tricky with speech therapist, I have had to let the last one go after 5 months for the same reason ( his SM makes it impossible for him to connect with them, no speech, eye contact or acknowledgment that they are even in the same room...they become impatient and sometimes upset). I give every idea possible to help to no avail. I truly hope maturity can help with all this.. however I am afraid maturity will also bring an awareness of his differences. Just trying to cram him with a lifetime of self esteem. The best of luck to your your family and son! Might I ask about his therapy sessions? Are they isolated from other kids or is it usually in a big room with other kids and therapists? Does he have any siblings close to his age? My 3 year old daughter (though she swears she is 5) had been a tremendous help with him and his therapy sessions though sometimes she likes to be the center of attention. We have noticed with his new therapy place is he is somewhat isolated from other kids other than his sister and that seem to have helped. His session are isolated just him and his therapist. He is and may forever be an only child... and as of the last 2 years his anxieties also consists of a few phobias. One of the most terrifying phobias are of babies and children younger than him . A little sibling may traumatize him beyond repair... all we can do is laugh at ourselves. He is just something soooooo amazingly different then anything anyone has ever encountered. Yet he is so silly, loving and compassionate with us at home. We know all will happen in his own time. I did find a SM group therapy but do not think he is ready as his autistic behaviors may be disruptive and I do not think they equipped to take him on yet. So we will give it a few months then try it out.  Info about navigating college with sm.  Advising meetings and office hours with professors, talking to administrators, using campus services spikes my anxiety to the point I cannot talk.  \n\n-Also - does anyone else with sm have trouble with written communication in addition to verbal communication? This place seems to have more teens and adults with SM than anywhere else i have seen. I have seen one study conducted on adults with SM. I too would like to see more about it.\n\n Does your college have accessibility services? Even as someone without SM I tend to avoid having to talk to administrators and such. I think it is important to obtain someone who is supportive, first and foremost, so that you do not have to navigate college alone. Campus services are meant to be open and non judgemental.\n\nHow much of an obstacle is written communication for you? Most people seem to be comfortable writing or messaging, especially under anonymity, but then I would not know if they were not. There are many kinds of variations among people. I do not have problems with written communication online, like here on Reddit. In fact, I have made several friends online that I chat with. But I do have trouble with written communication with people I know. Sometimes sending a simple text is already giving me lots of trouble. Some notes mostly to myself:\n\nPossible avenues to spread awareness:\n\n- anxiety and mental health subreddits \n- /r/AskReddit \n- /r/AskScience \n- /r/IamA \n- /r/casualama \n- /r/casualconversation \n- /r/subredditoftheday \n- /r/ofcoursethatsathing \n- /r/wowthissubexists \n\nDiscords! I do not want more attention here. Reddit got too big. All it will accomplish is bring trolls and gawkers.  \n\nIt is fine as it is. People who have it rare. Attention will drive them away and drown us out with noise.  \n\nIt will only be a matter of time until the immature grade school maturity level kids are shit posting and you lose control of this subreddit. Thanks for your input. I doubt anything could happen to make the subreddit so active that it goes out of control, to be honest. My campaign target is a measly 1,000 subscribers, which is not nearly enough to really get active. I would agree with you if this place had the potential to explode to tens of thousands. Given the specificity of the subreddit, focused on such a unique disorder, and the attention I give it, I think trolling and shit posting is a negligible issue.\n\nThis subreddit is for people touched by SM in some way. People who know nothing of it are unlikely to be interested enough to subscribe. It is not easy to make such a specific subreddit explode. I try to make an effort to target my growth campaign to places where I know people affected by selective mutism might be. My goal is to seek enough people out so that this subreddit becomes self-sustaining with regular content creation and community support, but not so many people that it would tip over into disorder and chaos. I hope that we can strike that balance. It is a slippery slope and it requires a steady user base to out number the adversarial users which I do not believe the topic of this subreddit has. Even in real life adults with SM are so few. The little kids with it are not going to be active here.  ", "Equine therapy for SM? My 14 yr old son has SM. He has seen a couple of therapists, only one he would talk to. She was a colleague of mine and therefore somewhat familiar. \nHe has recently done equine therapy. He has been to 3 sessions. I suspect he somewhat enjoys it (he is an animal person). \nHas anyone tried equine therapy for SM? His equine therapist is also a colleague but he had not met her previously. She is patient with him and they do a lot of rope work when he does not talk. She does not pressure him. He takes direction from her when he does not talk. I did not do equine therapy but I did do horseback riding lessons and that helped! That sounds like a good program, though! Anything this kid loves, get them into it. Anything that gets them excited or builds skills (therefore confidence) or that they love is worth getting them into. I have been into equestrian for a year and it is what helped me recover. When I first started I was completely nonverbal and withdrawn. It built my confidence up and I consider myself to be fully recovered. I have made quite a few friends within the sport as well. I would definitely recommend it This! I am a western horse riding instructor and am also currently learning to be a therapeutic horse riding instructor.  \nI was never officially diagnosed with SM when I was young, but both I and my therapist believe I had and still have it to some degree.  \n\n\nTherapeutic horse riding is a very good long-term way of treatment for a lot of both physical and mental disorders, specially if the patients naturally enjoys being in the presence of horses and the overall activity.  \nWe did not know I had SM when I was taking therapeutic riding lessons so it was never a part of any treatment goals. (I mean they knew I had \"low self esteem\" but it took way less of their attention)  \nBut I am certain that it could have helped me a lot more with the right diagnosis.\n\nMy point is, horses have a massive impact on us humans, just being in their proximity can drop our heart rates and makes us feel calm and relaxed.  \nThey are amazing and unique animals.  \nThey have probably saved my life more than once, the dream of owning my own horse is what keeps me going.  \nAnd so I am sure they have a lot to give to your son, honestly I am very jealous. XD Thank you so much for sharing this.", "6year old Josie... Does she have selective mutism? Hello everyone,\n\nMy best friend's daughter Josie is 6 years old. This spunky, funny, sweet little girl has never spoken directly to me. I have heard her speak to her parents, her sister and to her friends. She also does not speak to her teacher. Last year when she was in kindergarten the teacher was amazing and worked with her through her \"shyness\" but this year her teacher is a little less patient and keeps trying to find quick solutions to Josie's problems which is frustrating her mom. Josie would nod yes or no and could complete any school work that she was given but would not verbally answer questions. She is very intelligent but does not speak to adults that are not her parents. I was browsing through Google wondering if there were games or activities that would help with Josie's speech anxiety and Google gave me a link to \"how to treat selective mutism\". So I started reading and was shocked at how the article hit the nail on the head when describing what Josie was going through. I should also mentioned that her family is bilingual. Her family does not have the financial means to put her into speech therapy. What activities or home therapy can you all suggest for her parents or perhaps for myself since she does not verbally speaking to me. she will walk up to me and show me her boo boo that she got that day or a picture that she colored but will not speak. There is a lot regarding this topic on the internet but I tend to prefer listening to people who have been there and can recommend things that have helped them or their children. Any help or suggestions is appreciated! Its a not speech therapy issues. It is usually a anxiety issue. \n\nI would advise the parents to get an official diagnosis. \n\nThen you can start working with them that way. You need to use a combination of techniques for lowering her anxiety whilst also encouraging brave talking. \n\nTalk to the teacher about warm up time. So before school starts maybe some one on one time and a little activity they can do together to kind of break the ice. Really requires a diagnosis and buy in from the school though. \n\nWork on techniques to lower her anxiety like breathing exercises. \n\nGet a diagnosis though. Its the only place to start. Thanks! Love the \"warm up\" idea! Thanks! Love the \"warm up\" idea! \n\nDr Kurtz is amazing.  I also recommend the facebook group Parents of Children with Selective Mutism for your friend.  I actually learned about that page through this subreddit I think I might have had SM as a kid and was at least extremely shy. Pushing a kid with SM to talk is not the way to go; it is more about making them feel safe and comfortable enough so that they are more likely to feel okay speaking. Not really asking questions, but creating a sort of conversation (more like a monologue I guess) where she could feel okay joining in but there is no pressure. And if she does speak, do not make a big deal out of it! I do not know if this would apply to Josie at all, but I have always loved animals and they help me feel more comfortable and give me something to talk about :) I agree! Thank you! She loves my dogs and I thought about teaching her how to give them commands and treats... Then remove myself from her vicinity and see if she speaks to them on her own. I have my dogs because they help relieve my own anxiety. Unfortunately the teacher pressures her a lot and frequently makes her cry trying to force her to participate or speak. We definitely want to try and avoid the negative connotation associated with her speaking but instead it should be a positive encouraging experience for her. I agree that we should not push her to talk if she does not want to but instead try and help her with her anxiety. Thank you so much! All learning material is appreciated! That is sweet that she loves the dogs! I am sure your dogs are great and that you would supervise, but I would not leave her completely alone w them:) That is really unfortunate about the teacher.", "ghosted job interviewer I had a phone interview today for a job I applied to a while back, I set a specific date and time with the interviewer and prepared myself by practicing any potential questions I knew would stump me. The time comes and I do not receive a phone call. I wait for over 45 minutes, nothing. I message back the interviewer asking if they wanted to reschedule since I did not get a call from them, they responded saying they DID call me and even left a voicemail even though I did not have any record of it in my call log. I even made my mom call me to test if my phone was working correctly and I was able to get the call from her. \n\nthe interviewer messaged me back verifying my phone number and it was correct, so honestly I have no idea what happened there. the interviewer then calls me again, and this time it works, but I was so embarrassed and anxious at that point that I panicked and was not able to pick up the call. They messaged me again asking to try calling them back but I really could not bring myself to do it.. I feel like a terrible person for not responding to them and I know I really messed up but I really could not bring myself to speak under those circumstances, I wish none of this ever happened or that they agreed to reschedule for another day so that I could prepare myself again. \n\nI know passing up a potential job just because I could not speak at that moment sounds silly or stupid but I could not even force myself to speak to them right now even if I did pick up or call them back :( hopefully i can get another interview soon but right now I feel so useless. sorry for the long vent, thanks for reading :,) Interviews are so, so daunting right before it. But do not worry, it is a positive thing they wanted to reschedule again for the interview so they probably do like you as a candidate. Probably on their end, they just view it as simple phone tech communication issue and not placing the blame on you. If you feel you have some bandwidth, it would be a good thing to email them a reply to say it was a technical issue with your phone and thank them for their time, or proceed with the rescheduling. These things happen. Once you answer their call they will lead the conversation and you will do fine. When I have my interviews, I like to have a notepad on my laptop up for reference to help me feel a little better. Best of luck for your future interviews! thank you so much!! this actually helped me feel a lot better about this whole situation :,) hopefully things go better in the future! This is not silly, your setbacks are valid. I have done this so many times! I do not have any advice but I can relate... I just cannot do phone interviews, I have actually had one, said hello, and when they asked the first question I hung up. I only go for jobs who have job fairs or open interviews so I am positive I will have the energy and confidence to speak to someone and if not I can bail at the last minute without wasting someone is time. I hope soon you can land a sweet job and no longer feel like you passed up good opportunities. I get how you feel. I had a phone interview where 1) they made me call them 2) were busy so I had to call them back a second time 3) ended up keeping me on hold for an hour; and then when they finally got the manager to speak with me, the conversation just did not spark up. So my whole day was wasted and in the end I could not even complete the interview. I felt like garbage because of it.\n\nAnyways, you are not alone in your feelings. It feels like it is so simple just to answer someone, but when it comes down to it you find yourself trapped. I guess it would not be an anxiety *disorder*  if that was not the case.\n\nGood luck next time, you will find a job eventually, it is only a matter of time. You should have called after 15 minutes. They had the wrong number. Email them, apologize, and ask to reschedule for next week.", "I cannot talk in public, only to immediate family? I grew up and attended all my schooling (even my college) in the same town and never made one friend. I can honestly say that I never spoke one word in highschool. Teachers did not even attempt to call on me because they knew I was \"shy\" and would not want to be called on. I ate lunch in the bathroom for four years, would regularly spend entire school days in the bathroom or wandering off campus, and never talking to a single soul. College was the same experience for me, and I ended up doing poorly in many of my classes because I was too shy to show up for lectures, and then too shy to ask for the notes I missed afterwards.\n\nThe only exception to this behavior is that I had a few boyfriends that for some reason I was able to get comfortable with enough to speak to and develop intimate relationships with, but even with them I had difficulties speaking to their friends and families.\n\nHowever, I have never had difficulty speaking to my immediate family: parents and siblings.\n\nI even have difficulty speaking with my grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles.\n\nIs this selective mutism? I cannot really call it social anxiety because I do not feel overly anxious. I sometimes feel actually calm in social situations (i.e. - sitting in a classroom) but there is a complete inability for me to speak. I simply cannot find the words to say to anyone!\n\nI have been dealing with this for years (I am in my late twenties now) and have never had a friend outside of a boyfriend/immediate family as a result, but have never thought to ask anyone about my situation before.\n\nDo you think I have selective mutism? Or could my behavior be indicative of other disorders?\n\nThank you so much. It is SM. My 9 year-old daughter is the same way and she was diagnosed with SM. Its SM imo. I could have written this exact post. Down to the eating lunch in bathrooms. Def selective mutism. It sucks. I am also in my late 20s now. Yes this is selective mutism. I had the exact same all throughout highschool. However there is a possibility you might have another co-morbid condition(s). I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome at age 18. OP this is me, but I am the opposite in my mind. I cannot openly communicate with my family which in turn makes me unable to speak to people outside of it, if those people outside of it are within the presence of could possibly relay I talked normally back to my family.\n\nI feel for me, my SM lies in the *reaction* of my family/those who know me. Although I am out of practice and I speak low when I do, I tend to have the mindset I can talk to those outside of those that know of me already openly. As long as my family would never know of it.\n\nEdit: For me, personally I would prefer the opposite way (your way), although I am sure it is just as hard. For me I feel those people do not know me, so that is my mindset. I do not know yours though. Yes, this is textbook SM. The majority of SMers are described as goofy, silly, and even outgoing at home or with familiar people, but when they leave home or are around more unfamiliar people, they shut down and cannot speak.", "Anyone want to talk my discord is stuffy2828#6117 I have always wanted to talk to someone with SM or people who have recovered because I just want to relate to someone.

It goes away when I am more calm, but it is starting to scare me. At first I was ok with it because if I was upset I normally did not want to speak, but just yesterday I got into a fight and something I said was heavily misunderstood. Before I could explain myself I found I lost my voice, I could not use my vocal cords at all aside from making groaning sounds from how upset I was. I am worried that this could be the start of a serious issue for me as I can get upset or overwhelmed very easily, what should I do?", "This is the final week to participate in our annual selective mutism survey! ", "My mother does not seem to get SM I am 20 years old and I have had SM for as long as I can remember. I have always been unable to talk to people I am not close to. I cannot even say \"hi\" to anyone, even children when I first meet them. When I was a child, people said I was shy and would grow out of it, but needless to say, I never did. After 4 years ago, I was researching on selective mutism and I realized it was just my experience, so one day when my father asked me why I cannot talk, I told him it could possibly be selective mutism. When we got home later that day, he talked about it with me around my mother. She immediately said \"No, no, no, did she tell you she has selective mutism? She does not. Not at all.\" I was a bit confused so I asked why she was so sure. She said that \"people with selective mutism cannot talk. You can.\" And I was explaining how they CAN talk, just not in certain situations. She said she knew what is was and is nothing like what I have, and that I could talk if I had tried harder, yet people with selective mutism cannot. She then brought up one example that she ALWAYS brings up when I am talking about my inability to speak in social situations. One time when I was 14, I answered a security guard's question. I burst into tears and had trouble breathing afterwards, but she always brings up the single time I spoke to someone when I was 14. I do not know how you guys feel about it, but I know people with selective mutism who have spoke to strangers way more than that. Anyway, she says that situation proves that I do not have selective mutism. I remember going through security to get on a plane with my parents. Because I could not talk, my dad suggested to my mom that we get some sort of badge or bracelet to show to security in case something happens and they do not know why I will not answer them. She refused the idea and said that \"She just needs to work on it, she does not need a badge because it is not a problem like that. She is not disabled. \" \nI understand that she does not want to think I have a huge problem, and that selective mutism CAN get better, but she seems to have too much faith in me. If she just understood my problem, it could be easier for her to help me like she honestly wants to. Honestly, it can be kind of annoying the way she acts towards this. She even says that if a person gets a diagnosis, it will just encourage them to believe they have a bigger problem than they do and only hinder them. Wow, I am SO sorry you are going through that! I do not know that I have a lot of advice for you, but my heart breaks that your mom will not acknowledge your very real issue. \n\nI work with a little girl with SM, and I can say that everybody who says that you are just \"shy\" is wrong. This little girl has no problem interacting with people UNTIL they ask her a direct question, and then it is like a veil goes over her face, and she goes blank. I have worked up to being able to talk to her without her going blank, and she will even answer me with nods or by pointing. As far as I am concerned, she and I communicate fine, and I do not care if she ever actually speaks to me.\n\nI think your dad is on the right track with ways to help. Is there a way to implement those without looping your mom in? Huge good luck to you! It seems like your mom is making it about her.  She does not want to awknowledged it because it will make her either a bad mother for not getting you help earlier...or a bad mother who gave birth to someone defective.   Either way, her denying it is her issue and you should not have to suffer anymore for her pride.  Work with your father to get the help you need.  She is not an expert in it.  She has not done the educational training.  She has not lived your experiences.  Of course she wants the best for you, but She is avoiding the reality of the situation and wants to pretend everything is normal.  This is a \"her issue\".  You tried it her way for years and it has not gotten better..  its time to do it your way.. Believe in yourself and the compassion your father is showing you. As for the diagnosis...so what. Its just a label on a paper that points people to skills/medications that are design to help them have an easier time in this world.  It is only bad to people who do not understand.  We only hear about the extreme cases because that person has struggled so long without help.  The earlier we find out that we need help in a particular area, the easier we can learn to manage it.  Having a label does not change the fact that you have trouble speaking with people.  The label can help point you to things that can help with it.", "Just glad schools over  Omg, if that happened to me I would never show up to school again Fie, if 't be true yond hath happened to me i would nev'r showeth up to school again\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Damn, maybe it was just me then lmao I would be impressed that I have so much power that they will cry over me. I had a classmate that just took her table and changed to another position in the classroom, table and all. I seated alone the rest of my school years except the last 2, where I sat with another anxious person who felt quite the same as me why did this have to happen to me ;-;", "What do I do when teachers do not answer my emails and I cannot talk to them? I miss a lot of school so I email my teachers when I need to know what I missed. A lot of my teachers do not respond to my emails and expect me to go up to them and ask. This causes me to miss assignments and not turn things in on time because I cannot do that. I think they know I have selective mutism (idk if that is just public info they know just a guess). Tricky situation. Back then I had no other means than to talk to them and I think that it helped.\nIt also helped to talk with them over mutism (at leats the nice teachers, which i could trust).\nI felt enormous anxiety before talking to teachers, i mostly waited until everyone else was gone and tried to talk to them. It helped a lot, to \"just do it\". I use my anxiety as a motivator. I do not want to lose to mutism, so i just jump into (talking-)fear inducing situations and i am so happy after doing it.\nThis gives me a good amount of self esteem, which really helps.\nIf you want someone to talk anonymously, we can chat if you want. I was diagnosed with SM while I was about 4 years old (21 now) and improved a lot!", "My experience with SM Hello. I am currently 19 years old and had, admittedly, self-diagnosed SM as a child. Please do comment if I was wrong.\n\nBackground:\nI did not have the ideal home life. My family, being the typical Asian family, did not care too much about the effects of their words on a child. I had learned very early about what kind of existence I was to them at that time.\n\nI have suffered from depression since I was 11. Whenever I spoke at home, it usually received a bad response. The trauma made me develop a fear for speaking to my family, which later grew into selective mutism.\n\nHow it felt:\nA lock without a key, Even if I wanted to speak, massive waves of fear and anxiety would drown me. My hands would get sweaty, suddenly the words I wanted to say would get jumbled up in my head. \n\nEven if I try to speak, my throat would feel paralyzed and all I can manage are raspy staccato of the first syllable. \n\nIf I HAD to speak, I would practice over and over again. Not that it helped any.\n\nNow:\nI can speak to my family now. I still do practice in my head over and over again. My voice is still locked but I have the key now. \n\nI only speak in short sentences because speaking for longer still gives me anxiety and panic. I also cannot deal with sudden conversation. \n\nI am about 30% there, but I am doing my best everyday.\n\nSide effects:\nI never had selective mutism with my friends. However because I spent my childhood years being silent/keeping my face expressionless, I sometimes have a hard time talking to my friends.\n\nStuttering, stumbling over words, jumbling up my sentences, the occasional wave of anxiety. I feel it outside of my family.\n\nI am sensitive to it and it upsets me greatly whenever it happens.\n\nBut, I am slowly getting better. Every single word I thought I could not say, I will one day say it. I will make sure I do.\n\nAnd I believe in you. Or whoever in your life suffers from selective mutism. Your words carry weight, they are important, both to you, to me, and the people who love you. One day, we are not quite sure when, but one day definitely, your voice will take you where you want to be. I would say you have chronic anxiety. I understand why you think selective mutism applies but a mute is someone who does not speak and a select mute will not speak to friends or even all family...at all.\n\nIm not trying to criticise you. If anything Im suggesting that your anxiety is social and chronic because it is always there and so constant.\n\nThat does not mean you cant find similar coping strategies or share very similar feelings with people who are diagnosed with SM. \n\nEnd of day, its all a terrible level of anxiety we never asked for.", "User flair is now available in this subreddit! **What is user flair?**\n\nUser flair is an icon or text which appears next to your username anytime you comment or post.

I am fine knowing that it is I just want to know the truth. Not at all. Anxiety disorders are caused by a combination of genetics and environment. If anything, it is probably your family's fault for your SM. Agree. It is a combination of different factors. Genetics can be one of those factors.  Not your fault and shame on your family for telling you that. No it is not your fault. Selective mutism is never your fault. You cannot help it. Your family is wrong.

At least as far as I can tell. I mean she never talks about it, not with me anyway.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of the day I suppose I am the one responsible for my own life. \r\nAnd I mean, it is not unbearable, \r\nI have adapted to it anyway.\r\nThere are still things I enjoy that I can do.\r\nAlthough I do unfortunately get depressed or lonely every now and again,\r\nBut even that I am used to.\r\n\r\nAnd I do want to go outside, I love nature, the feel of the sun on my skin, a cool breeze on a hot day, leaves falling in autum, the chill of winter, and most of all the stars in the night sky.\r\n\r\nBut I know the kinds of things people do to recover, and It terrifies me.\r\nAnd I am so accustomed to living this way, I cannot even really conceptualize what it would be like to go out into the world at this point.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I will just keep sitting on this fence and see which way I fall.\r\n\r\nThere was no point in reading this, I am sorry.\nThat probably took like an hour to write\nSo I guess it was a a decent way to kill time if nothing else I think you need to find what you want out of life, regardless of how un-attainable it may seem. I am on my own path to recovery with my family (cannot talk to them)...and trust me even though today I just want to blurt out sentences to them, at the same time I just do not want to even go near them.\n\nI find disclosing what makes you uncomfortable surrounding speaking helps, ever since I disclosed to my Mom; since I will talk to her a bit about my issues. They want to help, but I think they miss how to effectively do it (which is understandable, as they are not me). I have been thinking about writing out a paper for them about why everything is the way it is more exactly, and how in an ideal world...maybe how things would be or go. I wish they did not know I could never speak or anyone ever did, then I think speaking would come pretty easy besides my inner self being a little nervous or embarrassed of myself for doing it so openly. Though I am sure in time that will go away. I would then keep the mindset to let my mind flow...and speak via that because I often wish people could just read my mind instead.\n\nThe thing is you have to realize where you are comfortable, I know over Xbox I was a Fiend on the mic besides starting conversation that much with my friends (schoolmates I had a problem with too since they knew me as someone who does not talk...although if they caught me on Xbox, I would talk to them).....college scares me, but I can talk to complete strangers. Though I am scared someone from my HS will be attending this 2nd-year college I am leaning towards (transferring) and I will shut-down....but I am also scared I will feel like the new students would be getting to know me too well and I will shut-down to not talking again. So I guess the first day I will ask questions or something...maybe one in each class, so I am already put out there as someone who is par-taking. It just makes me nervous when talking to people I do not know generally, but I am sure overtime that will go away or lessen to a point, as I hear those who have recovered stories.....they give me a spotlight into what things could be like/have become for them.\n\nI have seen a girl on YouTube who I think just accepted her life as SM i her early 30s, and I find that sad. I am 18, I do not want to be a part of any of this by the time I am 19....and that is 3 months and 13-14 days from now......and this has been a life-long issue as I am sure yours is probably as well. And I am not saying she does not have issues like we do, but giving up hope to change, I hate that. Everyone should be encouraged to change in some way as time goes on, set goals...etc., etc....Though my issue with direct family really developed during Middleschool when I basically fully shutdown talking to my students because at the time I could not handle new people like that.\n\n*When is it hard for you to speak to other people? When is it comfortable, in any sort of way?* Pin-point as much as you can about your SM, then work from there. Develop goals.\n\nI have just been trying to do more and more as the days go on....and that is really been since telling my Mom \"I hate the reaction they give, and I am talking anything...do not even mention it\"....although I need to re-enforce that to her because there is too much straying. One day I was just committing to saying yes/no instead of nodding most of the time....yesterday I just spoke a little more in ways I usually would not, although I kind of reclined on that head nodding goal...from the yesterday's yesterday....today I will go with that and try to speak more again.....I told my Mom I threw a fork out in the garbage...I did, and normally I would have let it get thrown away. I more did it for talking purposes than anything though. I do not like picking stuff out of the garbage, I am very much a germaphobe.\n\nAlso I am not going to act like a month ago that...I really did want change, I did not. Although I knew this would be a problem later in life regardless, I did not care. I think every one does to an extent wants change, it is just if you really put it all into scope or not (I mean you are here, I was not before I wanted change, I avoided anyone like me like the plague). I think this change is uncomfortable as fuck, but there is so much more there. Also we have to keep that mentality, we are not the \"normal ones,\" so if you speak to someone you do not know, no one knows the wiser. If anything you stick out more if you do not. One thing SM has always helped with though is exposing the people I would not want to associate myself with. If I recover I think that sense of detection will still be there, but I will miss the brute-ness of the obvious exposure someone was an ass. That is why I never got mad when someone was being that way, because it just shows me your that kind of person, my Mom gets mad though. I more sort of use that to re-evaluate myself than anything when it happened.\n\nThe reaction only exists to the extent we let it effect us, and sometimes it does not exist....e.g. people who have no clue who you are. Although, I just like you, are indeed scared shitless of the reaction (well I am assuming). That is my biggest fear RN, it is no longer committing to speaking which I thought it was a couple days ago....it is definitely still the reaction although my parents know of that fact, they have to be gung-ho in that way.....I AM NORMAL in my mind, I just do not talk on a normal basis. **That is it, when it comes to outside perception.** If they would let me be in full confidence they would not.....without that fear of mine, I could do so much. \n\nThat is why if I ever have kids, I am encouraging them to be as social as possible, to speak to everyone...like waiters at restaurants even if they are 3 years old, etc.......and to be as much of themselves without fearing judgement if they suddenly change rapidly. Not like my Parents are that ill-intended.....well my Mom is questionable...but my Dad is good in all this in his intentions, though he is probably my biggest issue in this problem, as well. If I have a kid like me, well I guess I will know what to do otherwise.\n\nMy Dad and Mom can just be too interjecting, they need to just let me be. The ability is there, the want is there....just let me do it without fear. Also they need to encourage me to join the conversation more. Thank you for your consideration, I appreciate the effort you put into your reply. \nAnd I certainly have not given up, not entirely at least.I think I am just waiting for a push, hopefully in the right direction. Yeah, no problem. It helps me get my thoughts out too. Hopefully a push will come soon. I wish I had some form of advice for you, or at least a way to make things even a little better. But what I can say is that I know exactly how you feel, and you are not alone in this It is okay I was not really looking for advice, but thanks for your time Mate, with the virus going around we are all trapped inside now. ", "Writing a character with Selective Mutism Hello! I would like to write a selectively mute character and would like to ask a few questions. Please do not feel like you have to give any personal details. \n1. How severe is your Selective Mutism? Can you talk/communicate to just your family or close friends? \n2. Is it easier for you to talk to or communicate with someone the longer you have known/ been around them? \n3. What is your preferred method of communication? Do you know any sign language? \n4. Are phone calls harder or easier than face to face communication? \n5. How have people treated you because of your mutism? \n\nThank you! \ud83d\udc95 Theres another post about this with great replies but I will answer anyway\n\n1. Personally i can only use my AAC or ASL with 90% of the people i interact with even my family. My dad and mom sometimes im verbal with and occasionally i speak with my grandmothers or my one aunt. \n\n2. For me it depends on how rushed/pressured i feel both by them and the environment so I would say a partial yes. I have known my dad most my life but sometimes/some places i find it impossible to speak. Same with my mom and the others mentioned above.\n\n3. I know very little ASL actually but I use what i do know (and they know) and especially my AAC\n\n4. If I need my AAC then absolutely a video call is better because I feel more comfortable being able to read their reactions and understanding off their facial expressions (im autistic as well) whereas when I am verbal like with my best friends though occasional I much prefer an audio call/VC\n\n5. My parents took it very well although they struggle to understand when im trying to communicate outside my AAC very often. My grandmothers either have always known me to be silent sometimes unaware of my mutism or ive been verbal with them. My one aunt would take it well and i think has taken it well despite not knowing i am selectively mute. The aunt i live with has been as kind as she is able to be whilst not understanding and being under stress. My high school friends did not treat me well. They either got annoyed or ignored me. My one best friend used to be abusive but with help from multiple sources including me has improved SO much. My other two best friends from much more recently have been so so good. They respect my boundaries and ask relevent kind questions. 1 pretty severe compared to the average person, but not severe compared to others with SM. i can talk to close family and a couple friends\n\n2 it is not a perfect correlation, but for sure that is true yeah. i find it easy to talk to people i have known since forever, and with a lot of struggle i could maybe say a word to a complete stranger, but everyone in between - the people regularly in my life i have not known massively long - is pretty much impossible. knowing if i speak to them, i will have to face then again, is daunting\n\n3 personally i use text to speech on my phone, or type in notes/on paper and show the person. i guess i can communicate nearly equally to a non-mute person - i am a really talkative person, just not verbally. i have friends who said they sometimes forget i have never verbally spoken a word to them, because i am just so chatty. i know a very little bit of sign language. normally if someone tries talking to me, the people around me will tell them i am mute, but i have learned how to sign \"i cannot talk,\" so if that is not possible, i sign that and it usually sort of tells the person there is something up - whether it be deafness or mutism or whatever they might assume - enough for them to realize i cannot talk when i cannot tell them that face\n\n4 honestly i cannot really do either, but if i was forced to - phone calls easily. that is where i next plan to make progress :)\n\n5 occasionally strangers treat me like i have some kind of learning disability/i am deaf or something. that sucks. in public, it is not as apparent you are mute as you might think though. most people do not try speaking to you, and you can get by 90% of the time with nods and shrugs\n\ni hope that helps a little bit 1. Personally, I cannot talk to most of my family and I have lots of close friends that I cant verbally talk to either. For example, i can talk to my mum and dad, but not my brother or my grandparents, or anyone else in my family, and i cant talk to a lot of my friends in front of people i dont know or in a voice chat\n2. in my case, no, i have been able to talk to some people a few weeks after i met them, but not some people i have known my entire life\n3. i prefer typing, though sometimes my SM prevents me from doing that, in person i generally get someone else to talk for me, and i do a lot of nodding, shaking my head and shrugging. i dont know any sign language, i dont feel the need to learn it as there arent very many people who know it\n4. phone calls are more difficult, partially as i cant tell when theyre going to talk, so i dont know when i should talk\n5. some people, although they know i have SM, dont understand that i struggle with not just verbal communication, but other things as well, like texting, so they think im rude when i dont respond, or respond with \"yes\" \"hm\" \"hmh\" e.c.t seems theres a lot of writers here today! \n1. i can talk to my immediate family and some close friends, but only if there are not too many at a time and i have never tested it in person (they live in different states.) i cannot talk to these people in public normally either, maybe a small yes or no here and there but not much beyond that without severe discomfort.\n2.i think so? my sm is fairly new but i think for me it depends on the situation, some people are higher stress than others for me just because of their energy levels. \n3. when i cannot speak, i tend to just mime or write notes on my phone or in a notebook. i do not know much ASL but i am trying to learn, i think it is a good skill for those with sm to have. \n4. for me they are about the same. i cannot talk on the phone at all unless my mother is present, and even then it is only \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d\n5. i have the privilege of being previously completely verbal, it is only within the last 3 months that i developed sm. i can say with 100% certainty that people treat me worse now that i cannot speak. they tend to either pretend i am not there despite my effort to communicate, or they baby me, act like i am a toddler. people will refuse to read my notes because it is \u201ctoo much effort\u201d, make jokes about me when i cannot defend myself, etc. the world is a lot easier when you have a voice \nhope at least some of this helps! Thank you so much! You are Welcome! Just remember I am not the only one :) Check that other post out too Thank you!!! i actually made a post about this on tumblr haha  but i will do my best to answer here. i am a writer myself, so i know how it is lol.\n1) my sm is moderate, i would say. i can talk to my close friends and family, but no strangers really. i have been working on ordering at starbucks tho :)\n2) for me, yes, but it can take a very long time. i was with my first therapist for months before i said a single word. we moved up from things as simple as blowing air to making singular sounds until i could talk to her. i find that even when i can talk to someone, it takes a lot longer for me to be able to joke around with them.\n3) for most of my life i was told i could not use alternate communication because it would be avoidance, but now i am taking asl in school, and i carry a notebook everywhere with me for emergencies.\n4) there is not a very big difference for me i do not think, but i have never talked on the phone to anyone i do not know irl.\n5) i could go on for hourrrrrs ranting about this lol. some people are really good about it, to start with the positive. i have had friends who are patient and accommodating, and i have had kids yell at me to talk whenever the teachers were not looking. most people mean well, but i get babied a lot and talked about like i am not there. people tend to talk to me in a high pitched baby voice, and sometimes even coo at me even though i am 16. it is a time. before i was diagnosed and got legal accommodations for school, teachers used to call on me and wait like five minutes while the entire class stared at me, waiting for me to talk. in conclusion, most people mean well but they end up treating me like a pet or something.\n\nbest of luck with your writing \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c Thank you for your response! Thank you!!! Thank you for your response! \n1. I only spoke to family at home when we did not have visitors. Never said a word to them in public not even a whisper. Now I can say a few words to my husband and children but rarely, I am self conscious of using my language in France. I have almost complete mutism in French.\n\n2. I am not sure what the criteria is because I have known most of my classmates for years (small island) and never spoke to them.  I still cannot speak to my in-laws even though I have lived in France since 2015. I speak to my best friend though, I met them online and they are just easy people to talk to.\n\n3. I never had a method of communication, never shook my head or used cards, nothing. I do not know Sign Language, to my knowledge it was not used on my island. Now I prefer email or text. I have my phone set to block any calls from numbers not in my phone book.\n\n4. They are both hard, if I have to initiate a call chances are I will never do it. If I am expecting a call I will stress about it unless it was agreed upon to expect it at a certain time.\n\nOh boy, back home people grew to accept me, to my knowledge I was the first child they even had with Selective Mutism now there is a few and they are receiving help. Here in France they treat me like I am a complete weirdo, I actually had someone call me bizarre in a meeting for my son. Now going through an inquisition because they refuse to believe this is my normal something must be wrong with me. I am being abused, I was abused, I have a phobia of going out, I am afraid of people. It is exhausting and quite frankly aggravating. 1. Overcame it almost completely at around 16-18 Years. Been in therapy since I was four, which helped a lot. (Was able to speak mostly in Kindergarten and grade school, although getting nervous when talking)\n2. Definitely. Close people get to see the real me, stranger or not so close friends get a more reserved version of me. It depends on the chemistry how fast I warm up to them\n3. Talking or Chatting, usually. Depends on the situation or the topic\n4. I can do them just fine, but I do not like them. I do not like talking and not seeing a face with it. So I would say they are harder.\n5. My peers? Not really different, many do not realize it until I tell them. Never really got bullied or teased. Always had good friends to hang out with. My teachers put me out of my comfort zone for growth (my mom told them about it), but I never got special treatment because of being selective mute.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, feel free to ask away! 1. I am mostly recovered, my sm tends to be more affected by topics and my mental health state than the people I would be talking to. With friends I can talk always except when I am straight out of a panic attack, with family I can talk about anything but mental health and them being too close or getting too loud or insisting that I speak make the silence last longer and my entire body to freeze up. With everyone else I talk when prompted and dismiss mental health as \"I am okay\". It has been at the point of I do not talk to anyone ever.\n2. It comes down more to trust than how long I have known them. If we have had a lot of fights or they have upset me a lot, triggered my mental health a lot, I trust them and speak to them less. \n3. I like to text people, I can handle ordering food by having it all written down on my phone's notepad as if I was ordering for a friend, body language is a good one, bowing a little as a thank you, nodding, pointing, peace sign and hand heart. I know Finnish Sign Language and a little bit of American, as signed speech or help signing. The thing with those is, most people do not know them, so I have taught FSL to my current friends in case of a bad day.\n4. Harder, a lot harder, a lot more stressful and awful. There is no way for me to communicate if I go mute and I am already stressed so I am much more likely to go mute.\n5. It is culturally normal to not speak to strangers, so they do not really see a difference, teachers tend to note that I am a bit shy, I do not participate verbally unprompted, my mom tries to push me to talk, which just makes me want to leave and never come back, dad just lets me be, he is very non-talkative too, my sister can be either, mostly she is like my mom. My friends from kindergarten took it well, I think they thought I was completely non-verbal, we did more activities where speaking was not required, they joked around, I laughed with them. Elementary/junior high school friends kept asking why I was so quiet, practically trying to pressure me to speak, or just ignored it and explained their own things to me. My current friends in high school have taken interest in learning fsl, they have asked how they should treat me when I go mute, they take it well and I love them.\n\nWriters really seem to be interested in sm today. You are the second one I have seen and usually there is no one. 1. It used to be worse, I never talked in school even in college. I can talk to family and close friends. \n2. Depends, I can talk to strangers better than someone from class for example. \n3. I prefer text because it is easier to communicate my feelings and I can fix typos and also not blabber words that end up not making much sense. I know all the ASL alphabets and a few other signs but not enough to make conversations full ASL. \n4. Phone calls make me more anxious because I cannot see the other person\u2019s facial expressions and they cannot see mine. Text &gt; face to face &gt; video call &gt; phone call. \n5. People have been nice to me usually. I smile a lot, sometimes out of uncomfortable-ness and I guess I give off the sweet &amp; nice vibe. \n\nI think I have gotten better over the years so I would say my current situation is closer to someone who has recovered SM rather than someone who had just gotten diagnosed etc. I definitely would still get super anxious in a situation where all attention is on me, like if I had to present in front of others. 1. I had severe Selective Mutism as a kid and teenager and I still have social anxiety now. I only communicated in situations that felt safe and comfortable to me. I did not speak to all my family members especially the ones I did not see often, but I communicated normally with my parents and brothers. In other social settings like school I did not talk at all except in rare occasions when it was forced like answering questions with all the social awkwardness that comes with it, I found it very hard to speak loudly and people often did not understand what I said. I also did 1 on 1 at times with the few friends I had.\n\n2.  Feeling comfortable with someone was and still is important to me when it comes to communicating, it did not really matter how long I known someone. In contrary I often find it more difficult to start speaking to someone the longer I keep quiet. I think it has to do with guilt and awkwardness for being quiet so long. \n\n3.  I prefer writing and I have always had more friends on social media than real life. It is just easier when you can think about what to say than having to react to someone in the moment. I use writing as a form to communicate my feelings and with others, but I do not use any sign language or alternative communication forms in real life. \n\n4. It is just as hard for me but I rarely call someone or pick up the phone unless I have to or feel comfortable with the person calling me.\n\n5. I went to a school for autistics because I have diagnosed autism as well, but I was still treated differently than anyone else by both teachers and students because of my SM. I also was bullied because of it because they made fun of me being quiet and did not understand why. It feels weird being with people that are different yet still being different from anyone else. Most autistics I know had a normal social life compared to me. \n\nThat is what I can think of for now but feel free to ask any questions. I am an open book. Good luck with writing!   Oh my goodness I have gotten way more replies that I thought I would! Thank you all so much for sharing your personal experiences! I am so sorry people have treated you differently! It makes me sad to hear, especially that some have been abused. \ud83d\ude25 You have a wonderful community here and I am grateful to have been able to learn a little about Selective Mutism for people that have it! Sending love! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 1.i think my mutism is moderately severe- I have no trouble talking to parents and siblings and I have four friends at school. I would say that is pretty average but my problem is how long I have been mute! I was diagnosed at 3 (although I am pretty sure it started before then as I have had it as long as I can remember) and now I am almost 17 still having never spoken to aunts, uncles, teachers or random strangers.\n2. It depends on the situation. For example if I was at a parents evening or would take me maybe half an hour of being in the school setting before I could speak to my parents comfortably and the longer i was in that situation, the easier it would get. But looking forward to hopefully being able to speak to more people, I think random strangers might be the easiest to talk to as they do not know my history and there is not an expectation to have to speak again, as I will never see them again.\n3. I usually talk through other people as I am lucky enough to almost always be with somebody I can talk to. After a few weeks of having a new teacher they learn to accommodate and will never make me feel uncomfortable, so I am never asked any questions that I cannot answer by pointing or nodding at school. I do not know any sign language but if be interested in learning, just feels like I would be letting the mutism defeat me almost of I just gave up on trying to speak and found a whole new way to communicate.\n4. I find phone calls really difficult. I am paranoid the person on the other end is  trying to 'catch me out' and have me on speaker with a room of people listening in on our conversation. This was similar to when I was younger and the teachers would hide behind bookcases to hear me read to my friend in the library.\n5. The vast majority of people really want to help me and are so supportive. All my teachers have been amazing, apart from 2 in my entire school career so cannot really complain:). One thing I have noticed is that I am often sat by the louder students in the seating plans. It is quite funny really because they think because I do not speak they can say anything Infront of me and I will not tell anyone. Some of the story's they tell really are quite funny, others I would rather not know...", "my life story I do not know why I am posting this, but if you want to read it, go for it. speak to me, I am down for extended conversations.\n\n\nI was diagnosed when I was maybe four years old. Apparently I was normal before, but then I suddenly stopped talking to my dad. I do not remember if there was anything that brought this on. My parents were never abusive, though my dad is a boisterous drunk.\n\n\nAs I was learning to talk, I would mispronounce stuff (like many kids do). One psychologist thought maybe I stopped talking because my dad would joke around a bit about words I said wrong. Not sure about that. I saw a speech therapist in early grade school for a while. I hated it, and I remember thinking she was mean.\n\n\nThat is the whole extent of the treatment I got for SM. I think I saw the psychologist when I was 4/5/6. There was not much progress made.\n\n\nIn kindergarten, they made me record myself using a weird big button thing. We would go around doing greetings, and I would have to press it and play my voice recorded. I hated it and resisted doing it all I could. \n\n\nBy some miracle, I managed to make two very close friends in grade school. I would initially only whisper to them, but eventually I spoke loudly. I think young kids were less judgmental and more just curious toward me. This changed in middle school when we all got older.\n\n\nIn my district, we had four elementary schools that all funneled into one middle and high school. So that meant there would be a shitload more people, and also that I would not have many classes with my friends - my biggest support.\n\n\nThis is where the depression began. Middle school kids were harsh. I am good at reading peoples faces and voices. I could almost palpably feel the judgement and sometimes outright disgust toward me. Sometimes I could get words out but they were quiet and nervous and awkward. I felt terrible either way and dwelt on it afterward. I got shitty grades but excelled at standardized tests.\n\n\nI also cycled through some weird...tics? for a bit. I would sniffle or make a small sound and later had trichotillomania aka pulling my hair out until I had a small but noticeable bald spot.\n\n\nOne of my friends made other friends. She realized how weird I was and that hanging around me would only bring her down. We parted ways. \n\n\nI read a lot of books and spent a lot of time online during middle school to pass the time. Initially I felt anxiety even talking to people online, but I got over that with practice. \n\n\nIn high school, I spent my days waiting for them to be over. I had a calendar, and I crossed off each day that passed, though I did not have anything to look forward to once the days or years were over. My one remaining friend was there for me if I wanted, but I stopped contacting her. I did not have a conscious reason at the time, but maybe it was because I did not bring anything to the friendship. I was empty.\n\n\nI did not get a driver's license or a job or a relationship. I was falling behind. I was not living. I realized I was missing experiences, wasting my precious teen years, but I did not know what to do to fix things.\n\n\nI took a gap year only because I did not know what to do with myself. I did not do *anything* for over a year. My family did not seem to notice how dead inside I was. I could still put on a happy exterior. On the other hand, with not having to interact with anyone, I did not have any anxiety. My resting heart rate went way down.\n\n\nI did not realize how bad it was. I tried not to think too much about my situation. I prevented myself from thinking by basically constantly consuming media, because it was easier.\n\n\nAll through my life my brother has been the person I am closest to - the only person with whom I can have a totally normal flowing conversation every time. Do not know where I would be without him. I still do not talk to my dad, but we have a good relationship somehow. I feel guilty about that.\n\n\nI went to a two year college without a plan or any sense of direction, but with hope that things would get better and with resolve to try.  We had to give lots of short presentations and group discussions, and I did them all. Sometimes things went very well and I was able to convince people I was normal. Sometimes there was zero anxiety, other times my heart was racing. Only a few times when a teacher unexpectedly called on me in front of everyone did words get lodged in my throat. It seems I am worse with males.\n\n\nI hate when people figure it out. I like when I can hide and internalize it all.\n\n\nThe depression became harder to keep inside. I got super unstable emotionally. My net happiness was higher than in years, but there were more peaks and valleys. I started reading and enjoying it again, something I had not done much of in five years. I did very well academically, though I struggled with motivation, procrastination, and focus. My brain feels very slow sometimes.\n\n\nI am not sure what I need. I have never liked the idea of medication. I do not like the side effects or messing with brain chemistry. I still do not like to talk to most people, so I am not sure about opening up with a stranger about my problems. Things have definitely gotten better, but I do not know... I think Lunch time was the worst part of high school. In class you could just sit there and breez by but lunch time, I always begged fortune for an empty table and that no one would try to come sit with me and talk to me. Honestly if people would come sit with me and be mean to me that was completely fine but I could not stand when someone would come sit with me and try to be nice and ask why I always sit alone. They never talked to me because they genuinely wanted to it was always because they felt sorry for me or something, I could not stand their pity. I read and appreciated all that you wrote. I relate to some of that and empathize with other aspects of your life. I grew up with undiagnosed SM and did not speak all throughout school including college. I did open up in middle school. I can speak freely with family. And I have always been ok speaking with boyfriends. I have do pretty well in job interviews and one-on-one interactions at work.\n\nI have had my ups and downs in life relating to my SM and social anxiety. I do not really have many friends and the friends I do have I do not feel much a connection with. I think I would consider my best friend to be my fiance. For a while I was doing pretty well and felt happy with my life and felt settled with being socially isolated. But this comes and goes. Now I am back feeling pretty depressed with my lack of a social life and the lack of feeling like I fit in anywhere socially.\n\nI feel really alone like no one understands what I am going through and that my softspoken and quiet demeanor is interpreted as being childish, immature, shy, or stuck-up. I just want there to be more people I can feel like I can connect with or open up to and I do not know how to find that. That is all, I think. Oh yeah, I would hang in the library during lunch. the cafeteria at my high school was too loud and overwhelming. Unfortunately I was not afforded that option at either of my high schools. On days when my anxiety got the best of my I would either hide out in a bathroom or just leave entirely. Those were tough days and I never thought it could get worse but the last few months I have gone from being completely at peace with my isolation to feeling utterly alone and more unhappy than I thought possible. I usually do not talk to people all that often online but now I seem to be reaching out every chance I get, I know ultimately it is all meaningless but... Thank you for sharing your story. Thank you for writing your story. Life with SM is not for the weak. As I age, I can see that everyone has fear and doubts about something or another. For us it is just harder to hide. I have dealt with SM and social anxiety for my whole life and I can see that it has ultimately made me a stronger, more caring human. I know I can do anything I want and I have realized the battle is me against my own brain and nervous system. Even on my hard days when my disorder fights back against my goals, I know that I can push through and at least do one small step to overcome the fear. \n\nI just wanted to say thanks for talking about it. I now have a child who is dealing with it too. At first she was outgoing and comfortable and started to stop talking to people when she was around 7. I know genetics play a part in our situation, but it is so hard to watch her go through the same things as me. I hope your parents are supportive of you. It sounds like your fianc\u00e9 is, so that is awesome.  I think interacting with people online a lot helped, maybe more when I was younger, with knowing what to say and gaining a bit of confidence or sense of community. And it is nice to relate with people with similar struggles.\n\n I hid in the bathroom sometimes too. It does feel so self-defeating...I am my own worst enemy.  I am not sure my family realizes how much it is affected me, and still is, because I am happier and more talkative around them. I wish the best for you and your daughter. :) Thank you. I agree with the last paragraph very much. \n\nI have been in some weird situations of people misunderstanding why I am this way, and trying to explain it feels a bit hopeless. talking about *it* makes me maybe more nervous and quiet than anything...yet if I do not address it, I feel like there is a massive awkward elephant in the room.\n\nI definitely go through ups and downs with feeling good/bad about my situation and optimistic/pessimistic toward the future.  I had the same problem with lunch in high school but got lucky I think. One year by chance I wound up at a table of sort of misfit girls and I opened up to them. Another year I found a girl who honestly was not very bright but she talked a LOT and loved Harry Potter and would just talk my ear off all through lunch every day and I never said a word, just listened. Then I started volunteering in the library and got to eat lunch in there, which was amazing. \n\nI think one of the more difficult situation for me was the lull in the morning before class started. Everyone had their friends and would be talking to each other. I started hiding in the bathroom until right before class to avoid this. There were some girls that went in there to smoke and so people started thinking I was smoking too. Once I walked in and a girl said \u201coh let us get out, it is about to start smelling like smoke in here.\u201d I hated the smell of others smoking but just dealt with it to hide in a stall.\n\nI like hearing your perspective and others that had similar experiences because I have never told anyone these things before. It is kind of a relief to finally talk about. I am late to this thread, but thanks is for your story. \n\nMy son has just been diagnosed with this. I am so worried for him, but I want to do anything to help him have a successful life. It breaks my heart to know how smart and awesome he is and no one realizes it because he will only be himself with me. Everyday I am sending him to school and putting him in a potentially terrifying situation. He has not started any treatment yet.  \n\nAll this time, I have thought he is just shy, but it is much more complicated.  I am not sure why I am writing this, just to vent maybe. I love him so much.  I dont want him feeling constantly scared. I hope I can get him any help he needs. I am sorry for the format and jumble of thoughts. I am just emotional at the moment. Thanks for reading.", "I need help So recently a rumour has started going around school that I like one of my good friends who has sm and before the rumour gets a round to her I want to tell her my self but do not know if I should tell her in person over text or just let her find out by the rumour what should I do I am asking because I do not want to put her in an uncomfortable situation Obviously I am not her so it is hard to say but personally I would find it easier if someone said that to me over text because I struggle with thinking how to respond to things like that I hope you figure it out though :) Thanks Text would probably be best, especially if she struggles to speak in a school setting as many with sm do. You will get a better response and give her time to think this way Life carries on kid, whatever embarrassment or shame you feel now will be met with your own laughter years later. Do not beat yourself up too much and let life happen whichever way it falls. I would tell her myself over text where she has a better chance of responding if I were you. Thanks every one Yeah you are right thanks I would talk to her in person, and if there is not enough time or it wont be a while before you can text her and explain.", "I am starting to realize my brother probably has selective mutism ... I do not remember at what point my brother stopped being himself, and pretty much stopped talking to my family. I think it was about when he was maybe 7 or 8, a few years after my parents got divorced. Maybe it was before then. He would still speak a little, one, two or three words at a time, but would shake or nod a lot and only to questions. He is 20 now, and through all these years my parents have tried to take him to therapy, put him on antidepressants and pretty much \u201cgave up\u201d on him (sad to say) because no one could figure out what exactly his \u201cissue/problem\u201d is. Its very easy to see him as unempathetic, uncaring, and stubborn (due to barely speaking) etc because even if its your birthday he wont say happy birthday unless someone else tells him to (for example). Ive worried a lot about him and my parents not doing enough to help him, and always questioning whether my parents are right in the fact that he doesnt seem to want to help himself (in therapy, trying to engage more with family, etc, have social hobbies) therefore why should we keep trying ? Reading some posts here is helping me understand your viewpoints and how its just not that simple. Also the thing is this selective mutism only seems to be towards my family. Hes made friends throughout school and they talk and hang out (or so ive told, i dont live with my mom and him anymore).  Im worried for his future, ive always been, the summer before he started college he pretty much just locked himself in his room and didnt come out for days, and he still stays in his room unless hes cooking. How do I help him? Am I helping him by not speaking to him, or should I try and talk to him even if its just me talking ? Should i bring up to my parents if theyve considered he has this condition? Sometimes I wonder if this has something to do with the divorce, or if I may played a part and dont remember. My brother and i used to play a lot when we were young. I feel like I dont even have a brother most of the time. I worry about my mom too since she lives with my brother and I know she worries about him too, while at the same time tries to cope with it and focus on herself as well. I hope this post is okay, id just love some guidance and perspective .   I do think that you should talk to your parents about this and maybe try a different professional. But since he talks with his friends it could be a family issue, that could have been caused by the divorce. Also, since he looks \"unempathetic, uncaring, and stubborn\" and has communication issues (like the difficulty in saying happy birthday) he could have Social Anxiety, or even Selective Mutism. Talking to him about it is also very important, but if you decide to do so, try not to put any pressure on him. There is also the possibility of him rejecting help, if this happens you could say to him to search about Selective Mutism.\n\n  Before you do anything I think you should have a good idea of SM and searching about it and reading the posts on this subreddit is a good start (there is also a ( page here). I wish you the best. Something that calmed me down and helped me build up to trusting people again was just having others sit and talk to me. No expectation that I would ever speak. For years and years only my grandma understood this, she would just invite me to sit on the couch with her or whatever and she would just talk and talk. Sometimes tell stories, sometimes sing, sometimes just sit outside and stare at the stars in silence. And that was okay. No pressure, for the only time in my life, I had someone who was willing to just accept me for who I was. I would still try and talk to him even if he does not respond. It feels pretty awful when people just give up and stop talking to you. For what it is worth if you have not seen him interact with other people it may not just be towards your family. I barely talked at school, but I still managed to make my parents think I had friends. I did not really though, I just I had a few aquaintances who were nice to me. I was never invited to anything though I only saw them at school or at events we both went to like pride or conventions. He could be struggling more than he lets on.", "Truly terrifying  So, actually you fear every man", "I have selective mutism. Hi everyone, \nMy name is Zoe and I am have selective mutism. I am so happy I found this subreddit as the situations I can speak in are becoming fewer and fewer. I am learning ASL in hope that it will help me communicate with people better.\nAnyone else here use ASL? What ASL? Hello there, I have selective mutism also and I have been learning asl on my own for about a year. I use lifeprint the most to study, but some classes would be nice. It is lots of fun and a great way to communicate American Sign Language Hi my names zoe as well I selective mutism too. I do not know much ASL but I did watch some random YouTube video on it and learned how to say my name lol. I have been thinking about learning sign language (Auslan because Im Australian) too. I am just not sure of it will be worth it as not many people know sign so I might not be able to communicate. But worst case scenario, I will have the skill to be able to talk to any deaf or HOH people I meet, so I guess its not a bad idea.", "I think I have selective mutism? (Story and Question) So it was definitely worse when I was younger, I will preface with that. I was a really \"shy\" kid. I literally did not want talk to anyone who was not family. And even then it was usually just simple, short responses or even just grunts or noises of acknowledgement. I got a bit better as I grew up, but up til 1st grade I only had one friend. Then I moved States and had to start over, and was surprisingly doing better? I was always wary at school, I had a speech impediment so I whenever I had to speak in front of class I shut down, and if I was forced to speak I was quiet and shaky. I made a few friends, but I was always \"the quiet one.\"\nMy home situation stayed the same as before, usually only talking when spoken to and short responses or noises. It is still like that to today, though sometimes I can manage a conversation (even starting one!) If it is about something I care about.\nSo I seemed to be getting better, I could not talk to strangers, that was just about it. I could talk to less known people when prompted with short responses.\nBut then I just... Stalled there. I have not really moved on from that point. I had a lot of familial drama around when I was 11, and by the time I was 14 or 15 I was diagnosed with Depression and Generalized Anxiety, though now several other additional diagnoses are being thought about, BPD being the main one.\nSo. That is basically my story, so here is my question. Is that selective mutism or just... Regular old social anxiety? Somedays my mental health is worse and so is my mutism. When I am distressed or have to talk about serious things or my mental health (like in therapy or with my mom) I shut down again and cannot speak. In situations that are not like that I can usually speak to my therapist or mom fine, I just have to be prompted first.\nOh I suppose I should add there is moments when I am better at speaking to strangers, I can strangle out a few words when prompted, but I think that is because I was on depression/anxiety medication (that worked) at the time. From what you said, you may have it. Speaking through people they can talk to/by being prompted is actually how some people with SM communicate. And it is not uncommon for SMers to shut down and find themselves unable to speak when the topic of discussion is more serious, such as their mental health. &gt;  I also have a form of autism \n\nwell I am not an expert but I am Aspie and I have Selective Mutism since I remember. So, is totally possible you have  Selective Mutism but you say you had  speech impediment  so maybe that is the cause. I had not and  speech impediment  just Asperger", "Sensory overload? Sometimes when I get sensory overload I start stimming but if I cannot remove myself from the situation, I  go non verbal or mute, and I also cannot speak certain places or ask certain things. Sometimes it just. Happens. As well, and I feel so stupid and pathetic.\n\nI stutter a bit and it is getting worse- no idea if that is related but. Idk I just want answers and idk where to go. It seems to mostly be kids with this issue and I am 17. I am too scared to elaborate much tho.\n\nI can TECHNICALLY speak in these situations but it hurts? and stresses me out to the point that sometimes I have a literal breakdown This happens to me too, the moment I start speaking it feels like im going to throw up and have a fit. Oh same. Even just going to the store, I get sensory overload. Age never made it any easier. Thank you for describing it.  I would love to know more about how it feels for people with SM.  My daughter does not want to talk about it. That is ok that she does not want to talk about it. A lot of SMers might not. When affected by SM, it sort of feels like your vocal cords are blocked. Your throat tightens up, and no matter how hard you try to speak, the words do not come out. If you manage to squeeze them out, it is only in a quiet whisper.\n\nI suggest reading this blog about SM. It is about the personal experience of a girl with it, it might help you understand it a bit better:  Thank you I legitimately have this then! i did not know you could TECHNICALLY still talk It is no problem \ud83d\udc9a I am sorry :( ik it sucks Yeah it is possible. SM is sort of a spectrum. It is typically referred to as low profile and high profile SM. High profile selective mutism presents as being completely mute with almost everyone in certain settings. It is the most common and may be much easier to recognize. Low profile selective mutism is a little harder to recognize as they can manage to speak, minimally, given the right circumstances. They may speak to a couple friends outside of home, or they may whisper or answer closed ended questions. It may be seen as shyness and then thus being missed.", "I made a drastic change I was not ready for, now I am suffering the consequences. TL:DR, changed my life but was not ready to talk, I lack conversation skills now people view me a certain way and avoid talking to me.\n\nI changed my entire life to get myself to a position where I can talk to people, but I was not, and could never have been, ready.\n\nThe problem is I have no experience talking, I can imagine myself talking, what I would say and how I would say it, but when the situation comes I forget everything and barely say anything in a flat voice.\n\nSimilar to if someone started fighting you, you have could learned about all the techniques, but without practice that would all go out the window and you would probably freeze.\n\nNow people view me a certain way and basically avoid me, so its hard to get the experience for it not to happen again. I am coming to the point where I need to talk to people or its going to be rough.", "It does not seem like he is even trying. I (24F) know that this may seem harsh but I have been with my bf (21M)for a year (I have known him for five years on and off)and he still will not talk to me. He makes noises and sometimes it sounds close to words but he has yet to talk clearly to me or even whisper and it is starting to hurt my feelings everyday. It is not like i am a stranger anymore and we spend literally every day together and text a lot too (and also he had said once that he was able to talk to his ex because they spent everyday together...just like we do...which that really hurt my feelings.) \n\nI guess it just hurts because when I ask him to practice saying a word or to try speaking it looks like he is not even trying because he will start doing something else and anytime I bring up ways to maybe practice more or when I brought up us seeing a counselor together he just kinds of shrugs and does not comment on it. This is super important to me because he is my future and I love him with my whole soul but if he cannot speak to me and it is been this long already then I am worried for our future.\n\nI also do want to add that recently he is been sending a video to me everyday (though it takes a lot of nagging to actually make the video after he promises which makes me feel horrible but he just procrastinated so much.) It is nice because I can hear his voice and he says it is practice for him but is it really practice when it is not to me directly?\n\nI really do not know I just get frustrated that the love of my life has trouble speaking to me and seems like he does not even try to practice speaking when I am around. How would you feel about him not speaking to you if, for instance, his voice box had been removed due to cancer?\n\nAnxiety makes the mutism worse. Judgement and pressure make anxiety worse. Anxiety also leads to avoidant behavior like procrastination or doing something different when an uncomfortable topic is brought up. \n\nYou are not his therapist. Stop telling him to practice words. Stop measuring his devotion to you by the sounds that come out of his mouth. If you need to hear someone speak to know they love you, then you need to find someone else to be with, full stop. \n\nI suspect he feels like you are not really trying to understand his situation and what he genuinely is and is not capable of. It is not wrong of you to want to hear \"I love you,\" voiced to you, but it is not productive for you to be in a relationship with someone who cannot say those words if not hearing them will leave you feeling bad about the relationship. Either let go of that need or, if you cannot, let go of the relationship. Sounds like he is avoiding practice because of how painfully hard it is. Pressure will make him more anxious, so I would avoid nagging him about it. Typically when someone tried to make me speak, I would turn away and hide my face. When you *ask* an SMer to talk, they just shut down. \n\nAs for the video, that is actually huge. It definitely does count as practice because there is many ways of communication other than speaking. Usually indirect speaking is easier to start with, before talking face to face. \n\nI know it is easier said than done, but try not to take it so personally. First of all - you need to get it into your head that it is absolutely NOT personal. *no matter how close you are*. Anxiety does not care about that.\n\nThe other two comments are good advice. We have a lot of resources here in the wiki that you can read/watch/listen to try and get into his perspective. I think you need the perspective because from what i have read it is like you do not see his side of things at all and that is your problem.\n\n \n\nLike the others said, sending any kind of recording or audio is a massive step for him. It *absolutely* counts as exposure, and a big one at that. Making any kind of noise, especially vocally, is no small task for an SMer. In fact, it is often used down the line in exposure therapy. Where exposures begin completely depends upon the person. Exposure does not even have to involve speaking.\n\nSpeaking to you is like an insurmountable mountain he has to climb. Inside he is in fight/flight/**freeze** mode, and pressuring him to speak will just make him even more frozen. That is the worst thing you can do. If you really want to help him, start with dispelling your misconceptions about his condition. Im just amazed how people with sm get girlfriends. I always see people on this sub talking about their bf with sm and I am like how did this happen? wat do you mean by that? It is not as harsh as everyone is thinking it is tbh. He procrastinates on everything in his life even when he has to go visit his dad who he loves seeing everyday (his mom and dad are divorced so he visits) and he still procrastinates visiting. I do not ever push it to the point that he physically can not do it because I do love my bf to the moon and back. We have boundaries and he said he would never do anything he is not comfortable with. I know that I will never understand completely why SM effects him the way it does but i am not a bully towards him. Well because I have sm. Really cannot talk to girls. Do not know how people are getting girlfriends basically without talking to them other then text. I feel like everyone that read my post thinks that I am pressuring my bf into speaking to the point that it is crippling him and that is not the case. We have set boundaries beforehand and I have asked him if it is alright to keep reminding him and he is told me yes because he does have terrible memory and forgets a LOT of things but he does want to practice speaking to me. And the whole procrastinating thing is because he does that with everything in his life even as simple as visiting his divorced dad whom he loves visiting, I just hafta nag because if I do not he will always forget. I know that I do not understand completely why he cannot speak to me and sometimes I am unfair but on my side of things it does hurt me personally and I just wanted to rant about it,but I would never hurt my bf in that way or make him uncomfortable. I do understand that asking him freezes him up because sometimes I see it in his eyes but I only ever ask when we are having a close loving moment and he is come close during the moments but not yet.\n\nI have always been there for him and I will stick up for him whenever his SM becomes a problem in public and I have never ever been mad at him for his muteness. I just wanted to provide a little input from the side of the SM\u2019s significant other because we do struggle as well. oh!! well we both like to think that it was meant to happen for us because back in 11th grade i saw him sitting alone and i sat down and tried to talk to him but all he did was stare at me and I thought it was really odd and that he probably hated me because he was ignoring me. After finding his facebook and talking I learned that he had SM and we hung out a few times until I lost contact when he started smoking weed and hanging out with bad people. 3 Years later after literally what seemed like a sign from God he came back into my life and we started hanging out everyday and now we are dateing and to me it does not seem like he has SM at all because he uses his phone to communicate with me and his moms gf and when we are alone he makes noises and grunts and laughs at jokes so it barely seems like he does not talk.\n\nMy advice is just be yourself and use your phone to talk if a girl is interested because if she is then she will not care about all that. The only thing she will care about is wanting your company :) It sounds like he may have a comorbid condition of add or executive dysfunction, which basically entails extreme struggling to order tasks in one's mind and a kind of mental haze that emerges when trying to focus on something. Does not really matter how important it is or how much you know you enjoy doing something, it can take an immense amount of mental effort just to keep a coherent train of thought and often such effort exacerbates the dysfunction Most people with selective mutism struggle with forming connections with others, being able to talk is a rather fundamental aspect of socializing and lots of people who struggle to speak in many situations will struggle to form and maintain close relationships.\n\nThat said, I am curious how you two met, if you are willing to discuss ", "Congratulations, /r/SelectiveMutism!

I do not speak outside of what is required to be spoken.\n\nThough if I wanted to speak like those others, I could not. I have times where I have no desire to speak and cannot make myself even when I know it is \"expected\". I also have times where I have something specific to say but physically cannot. Most often I find that in theory I would want to say something, but I cannot even begin forming the idea of what to say. All this is when something is happening that affects me. If it is just random strangers not interacting in any way (like your example of a class) then I do not want to speak to them anyway, but would not be able to if I did. Maybe over time not being able to speak to people leads to lowered desire to speak with them. Most of what people speak about is boring and useless anyway. I generally did not want to speak cuz I was expecting to be judged if I said the wrong thing. Not talking was my comfort zone", "r/selectivemutism Best of 2019 Nominations!

I am nominating /u/P00ld3ad obviously since I know that she has really put in an incredible amount to spread the most coherent and empirical information about selective mutism not only in this subreddit alone, but also on many others where due to her always linking this subreddit here, it definitely did end up helping a tremendous amount of people to find this place her to receive some support from the community, which definitely makes her the best contributor to this subreddit by a large margin. GO SIL!! &gt;:D All hail the true ruler.\n\nI nominate /u/theothersophie. The owner of /r/selectivemutism and the poster of this page, this subreddit would not exist in its current form without her. Her excellent leadership is impossible to ignore. She transformed a bare-bones subreddit with twenty posts maximum to what you see now: a subreddit with custom style and banner, a booming population, a flourishing Discord server, and a space for last year's best-of nominations. Under her reign, this subreddit has been chosen for June 24th's /r/subredditoftheday and has collaborated in an extensive survey, which she has personally published and written the analysis for.\n\nIt is my understanding that a different moderator has also been nominated. While you may argue for that moderator's influence on the subreddit, has the subreddit's owner not influenced more? Despite the moderator's contributions, has the owner not been at the head of it all? Weigh the evidence, and I am sure you would come to the conclusion:\n\nAll hail the true ruler, /u/theothersophie. ~~Thank you, your honor.~~", "Confusion Ok. So I am 14 years old and in middle school right now. I have been having problems talking when asked to since 4th grade. I suspect the cause of this may be selective mutism. I have showed nearly every symptom of it, but there is something different I see in myself. Which is that I can force myself to talk when needed, even when it makes me very anxious. I highly prefer to communicate non-verbally such as nods and I do respond with one word most of the time. But there have also been situations where I have forced myself to say two full sentences. Honestly it is getting confusing and if anyone knows what I might be confusing it with, let me know. I really want to figure out what the problem is soon because I feel like it is getting in the way of my education.", "Everyone at my college gets on my nerves, but today really sucked. (Trigger warning: mentions of bullying and abuse below)\n\nOk, let me explain. \nI cannot be the only one who hates hearing the phrases \"Why are you so quiet?\" And \"You do not say very much.\", right?\nI have had Selective Mutism for quite some time - about 5 years - after my early teenage years were filled with abuse and rigorous bullying. I use it as a coping mechanism when I shut down or go into a flashback as I also have C-PTSD. \nAt my new college where everyone is pretty loud and extroverted, people know I am generally a quiet person, but they all treat it like it is some major downside and it is some big detriment to THEIR lives. However, because I sometimes CANNOT say very much, I can be a good listener and I can eventually come out of my mutism for a short while to make conversation. But the constant chuckles from people after I say something really gets on my nerves - the most annoying is \"wow, you actually have a voice?\" And \"I wish you would say more- you are really hard to talk to.\"\nI find that these comments make me go mute more often, but today was the worst:\nToday was a \"mute day\" for me, meaning that today was just one of the those days where I could not say much. To start, my friends (who know I have Selective Mutism) said to me \"you are not saying much today - liven up a bit\". Another one pointed out that he could see my stomach when I stretched. I was already mute by that point and that comment just felt so gross and irrelevant, so I could not retort. I am not thin, neither am I particularly chubby, but I am sensitive about my appearance as that was one of the things I was heavily bullied for. \nLastly, my favourite teacher (who also knows I have SM) told me I am \"very quiet back there\" and asked if I would answer a question. It felt kind of insensitive as he knows that I do not particularly like to answer questions.\nToday kind of sucked, I will not lie. I really do not want to leave this post comment-less, but neither know what to say. That sucks. Wish we could just flip them off. Your voice is precious, and is not their property. I feel you. My sm is not that bad, but my cptsd definitely is. Today was a shitty day for you, take some time to recoup, have some fun, you deserve it after that. Maybe read a book or watch youtube videos or play games, whatever you are into. Sorry you had a rough day. Hope you feel better! This does sound sucky and I am sorry. I hope it gets better for you. It is hard when people around us do not understand how we feel inside. I can understand your frustration and to be honest I am do not get when people do not see how inconsiderate it is to ask someone why they are so quiet or act surprised when a quiet person speaks up. When someone acts that way towards me, I wish they knew that it bothers me much more than it bothers them. I am so sorry about your experience OP. This honestly feels like I wrote this myself, the laughs and little comments after I say something, wether it is to my friends at lunch and someone else overhears or if I finally get the confidence to answer a question in class are probably the thing I hate the most about SM. Feel free to message me if you want to talk at all whenever, I get how you feel with this one 100% Condolences. For me, this was a much worse problem for K-12. College was great because I could get through the day just listening to the lectures and never talking to anyone. Nobody really cared to talk to me. There were exceptions, like presentations and group projects, of course. But otherwise , I was finally able to learn that education could be fun.", "How many of you have already beaten SM? My username's a reference to having \"found my voice\". I am an adult who has for several years mostly been free of all the major symptoms, although I still suffer from social anxiety and there is a lot of remaining trauma, I think. My family was never okay with me having SM (I was r/raisedbynarcissists) and the way my SM was handled resulted in a million painful experiences for me. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to know how many of you are just looking for people with similar experiences looking back, and are mostly not silent anymore. I had SM all the way up until age 12 (I am 17 now). I has able to overcome it through the patience and encouragement of a close friend. Unfortunately, she is homeschooled now and we have not seen each other in a long time as a result, so I do not really have any friends at the moment.  It really sucks, because I may not have SM anymore, but I still have severe social anxiety, so making friends is next to impossible for me. But if I am being totally honest, I am not sure if I want friends anyway. People my age tend to induce a lot of anxiety and they drain me. I am similar! I broke through SM when I was about 11 or 12, I would say because of my own sheer willpower. I was sick of living silently and I hated thinking about how horrible my daily life would be if I was still selectively mute as a teenager. I am 18 now, and I have bad social anxiety as well. The only reason I have ever had friends is because someone else introduced me to them, or they came up to me. I just cannot bring myself initiate a relationship IRL lol... Now that I have graduated HS and my good friends are all going to different colleges, I am probably going to be alone for all my college life unless someone comes up to me and befriends me. I had SM from pretty much since i started school until around 11 (secondary school) then gradually began making improvements until 16/17 where i would consider myself 'no longer selectively mute'. Nowadays as an adult I am a pretty 'quiet' person but can handle my social anxiety pretty well.\n\nAlthough i had interventions they they never helped that much and i pretty much recovered on my own. Perhaps the naturally occuring life events acted as an uncontrolled exposure therapy, who knows.\n\nIt is great to see stories from others who have recovered or made progress. On the one hand, I have talked to a lot of people and given speeches that went fine in my first year of college.\n\nOn the other hand, I never initiate conversations, am still nearly constantly anxious, and situations have arisen where I go mute (e.g. prof calls on me and remarks about me never talking) I am mostly over Selective Mutism now at 33, after a few years of actually knowing about it. Once I found books on the Purity Culture/Movement, I finally started to understand the rest of the resistance to talking and being more open. I figured out what I was being exposed to and stopped feeling the persistent shame about speaking (hopefully). Currently 17 and had it as long as i can remember..id say i (for the most part) overcame SM 6 months to a year ago although i still lack social skills and have some social anxiety aswell as a lack of any friends...atleast i can talk now tho i guess I was fully nonverbal when I was in preschool and eventually was able to respond in a whisper sort of voice while making no eye contact around first grade. Some bullying happened. My parents were never really supportive of me either and they actually made me feel pretty ashamed of having SM.\n\nI actually broke through SM by joining the choir in second grade, although there were some setbacks and traumatic experiences that made me quit and then pick it up again before 4th grade. My biggest breakthrough ironically came when I lived in a foreign country with my parents for a year and a half and had to learn the language and everything from scratch. It is almost like... back home people expected me to know stuff, and to talk and act like a neurotypical kid. So when I was not like that, I was much more vulnerable to being hurt from it. \n\nWhen I was obviously the foreigner, people were actually a lot more helpful and understanding, so I was less embarrassed about making mistakes, and that helped me open up. Or rather I was able to bring the person I am into the surface, but in truth I never dealt with my selective mutism, so to this day I am still dealing with leftover social anxiety that are ok on some days but crippling the next. I am verbal in most situations now, though, and I can pass as neurotypical at work to survive, because let us face it, society is ableist, and I got to do what I got to do to blend in 'till I have enough financial stability to be more open about my struggles.\n\nPlus, I also have ADHD, which does not help when I am trying to be more outspoken lol, because a lot of times I zone out in a social situation so I do not even know what to say, even if I can, ha! Here is something that might be hopeful: I also have pretty severe social anxiety, but I was able to foster quite a few pretty close friendships in college through roommates. Mine were just randomly assigned and I only shared an apartment, not a bedroom, but living in close proximity to someone makes forming friendships a lot easier, kind of the way you might become really close friends with someone at camp despite not knowing them for very long (I imagine/assume). If you were planning on living at home for college, I would recommend looking into student housing if that is viable for you financially. It might seem extra daunting with social anxiety, but it actually helped me make friends easier and with less stress because I met people who were in a really similar situation, also pretty nervous about the whole thing, and actively looking to make friends. I started displaying symptoms of SM when I started preschool (so about age 3 or 4). At school, I whispered to a few trusted friends and eventually some teachers, but was SUPER verbal at home. Fortunately my parents were very supportive and proactive. I started \u201cplay therapy,\u201d which is an experimental form of cognitive behavioral therapy, when I was about 4, and was formally diagnosed with SM when I was 6 or 7. I had a 504 plan with the school district and my mom worked really closely with my teachers all throughout elementary school to make sure I had the accommodations I needed in the classroom (always had friends in my classes and seated next to me who could \u201ctranslate,\u201d met with teachers several weeks before school started, recorded video presentations instead of presenting in front of the class, classmates all got a \u201ctalk\u201d about my disorder and how to interact with me, etc.). I had a few close friends that I met mostly because our moms were friends, and one particular best friend who was very well acquainted with my situation and helped tremendously in school and out of school. The combination of therapy, school accommodations, and my mom\u2019s research and general proactiveness helped me slowly gain confidence over the years.\n\nWhen I was in third grade, I decided that I was mentally ready to start speaking aloud in school, but I did not want to take the leap because I knew that all of my classmates would make a fuss about the fact that I was suddenly talking. After a lot of discussion, my parents decided to let me switch to another school in the district, which coincidentally had a better gifted and talented program (I did really well in school despite the SM). When I switched to the new school, I had some accommodation from teachers and my mom still worked closely with them, but a lot less accommodation than before. I was verbal, though still very quiet - shy, but passed as \u201cnormal.\u201d I did not initiate friendships but was able to maintain them and even acted as my loud, talkative, at-home self when with friends outside of the classroom. I gave my first oral presentation in front of the class. I kept gaining confidence. However, I did not tell any of my friends I had SM because I was afraid of becoming defined by my disorder again.\n\nIn seventh grade, my family moved across the country and I started middle school, which was really daunting. I made a best friend kind of by coincidence/circumstance but we stayed friends until after we graduated high school. Again, I kept gaining confidence slowly and little things helped: finally telling my friend group about my disorder and realizing they were mature enough to not treat me differently, (oddly enough) starting to wear makeup and gaining self-esteem in my physical appearance which felt like something I could now control even if I could not always control my anxiety, starting AP classes in high school were I felt like I was with a group of students I fit in with better, and other little things. I began to find my niche, and that really helped.\n\nI fully planned to move across the country without any friends for college, but ended up going to the same school as my BFF, though we drifted apart after freshman year. Like I mentioned in a comment above, roommates were a really good source for friends because the proximity and similar circumstances made it easy to form quick but deep friendships. I still had a really hard time talking to guys in a romantic setting, that was still a huge social anxiety hurdle, but I forced myself to try out Tinder at the behest of a roommate and it really helped to be able to chat with guys before meeting in person. I met my now-boyfriend and found a close circle of friends, some of which deal with mental health and some form of social anxiety as well, and having people I can talk to about my disorder openly and honestly has been such an asset.\n\nI still come off as shy to people who do not know me well, and probably always will. But I overcame SM in stages and can confidently say I am very verbal and present as pretty \u201cnormal\u201d now. Reading other people\u2019s stories I realize how insanely lucky I was to have the support and resources that I did, and I absolutely do NOT take that for granted.\n\nI am happy to answer any questions or offer any advice because I feel like I have overcome SM more fully than some other people on this subreddit, and I have always wanted to find a way to help other people with SM. Stumbling across this subreddit has been so eye-opening, and honestly kind of exciting, because it is opened an opportunity to do just that. I am 43 and mostly verbal for the past 10-15 years. If I am overwhelmed or tired I still do, as my husband and wife put it, \"go quiet.\" I broke through it, but it came back.\n\nAfter preschool (where I did not speak to anyone, not my teachers or even friends) I eventually overcame it by myself. I could talk to teachers, classmates, and pretty much everyone, I was just shy and had a quiet voice. I would even voluntarily participate in school plays/speeches in front of the whole school.\n\nBut then I got bullied in grade 6 and got social anxiety. After that I moved schools and I was myself again for a bit (I was happy, influenced by loud friends who got me to talk, and could talk to most people but lost it for others).\n\nThen in grade 8 I got depressed. Negative thoughts and all that, and my social anxiety was at it is peak. Eventually I lost my voice, slowly than all together,\n\nI am now in high school and my selective mutism is nearly as bad as it was in preschool. I do not talk to anyone except my friends, turn into a mess during presentations, and so on. Now all my teachers are getting concerned because clearly, a high schooler that will not speak is not exactly the norm. I still have social anxiety, but I overcame SM around the time I graduated high school and was in a serious car accident with traumatic brain injury and a 6 day coma. I got my Psychology Bachelor's Degree a few years later and I never even heard of SM until I was doing independent research a couple of years after that. So I do not think most people know about it.    \n\nIf anyone here is interested in anime there is a great anime from about 2002 called Gungrave where the main character has what would probably be SM. I am an adult who suffered from SM. It began whe I started going to middle school. Before that, I was a happy boy, I was quiet but I did not even know it, and I had a few friends. In middle school, my group of friends kept shrinking until I was left without friends. I felt weird like something was wrong with me. That made everything worse, by the time I was in high school, I did not talk to no one. I began skipping classes until I flunked. I was scared to death of my dad but he reacted better than I thought. He just told me to start over at a different school. This time things were better, I had a handful of great friends, but others did not even bother with me since I was very quiet. I never had a girlfriend during this years. In my early 20s I had trouble socializing at work and I became depressed. I had suicidal thoughts but decided to see a shrink. They talked to me and prescribed Prozac but I never took it. This was the darkest period in my life. After this, I decided to make an effort and try to be more social and to talk more. It is been an uphill battle but I think I beat it. I am middle aged and people this days think I am nice a quiet. Most people like me because i like to joke and I am not unpleasant. I have a wife and kids and I am the happiest I have ever been. I still feel nervous with strangers or in social settings but not as in the past. I would shake in fear of ridicule at social events or when expected to speak. Now I am relaxed most of the time. I think what fucked me up was that I was beaten as a little kids by my parents. That made me feel worthless for most of my life. I always feel less in front of others and that terrified me and made me silent. Your husband and wife? Yeah. I have one of each. Oh cool!", "What is your job? I am 18 now and want/need to start working but I cannot find the right thing for me. Whenever I find something that might be good for me, I start overthinking about how it will affect my selective mutism or smth like that. I just want to get some inspiration and listen to some experiences...", "This is why I do not want to speak I do not idealize the normal life, so I do not want to speak.....\n\nI do not picture myself living the normal life, although if I was another person, with another life...I would not mind it.\n\nI do not resent the normal life, I just do not see it as the better one or the \"normal life\"...........I did in the summer, but that is when I could see the ideal life, with me still pictured in it.....not if I just happened to become (magically) an entirely different person, in an entirely different life....\n\nAnother life, is sort of just how I look at speaking, maybe in another life....\n\nFor now I am not existing, but I am here......i am here right now, and that is it.", "never in my life did i ever think i would come across an SM thread on twitter. this made me so happy  It is awesome awareness is increasing about SM however it is important to note SM is not a result of trauma. Mutism as a result of trauma is a different mutism diagnosis. This is so sweet to hear \ud83e\udd7a Ngl the twin one hit hard lol Which diagnosis do they receive? A lot of people here seem to have trauma in their backgrounds... While I was struggling to speak I never got professional help, in part because of the nature of my issue (I thought I was too mute for therapy), but my behavior closely followed the patterns of a classic case of SM, except my parents were abusive and I actually think it was the abuse at home that triggered my issue. The silence was a way I was afraid to act, make a move when confronted with a volatile, unpredictable parent. The mutism resulting from trauma would be a symptom of PTSD or ASD-acute stress disorder.", "Has your childhood sm affected your adult ability to socialize and develop a personality? I was completely mute (only talked to own family) for my four earliest years in school and I feel like this profoundly affected my social development. I am still selectively mute and struggle so much with conversing with others. Even when I have a conversation, I am never fully within the topic and am always in my own head and thinking about how to respond or what the other person is thinking about me. I hate that I never moved on from my social anxiety, which was genetic, and now I am avpd. Yes it does \ud83d\ude2a Yes, I struggle with conversations and when I am not involved in one I like... space out and apparently am rude. But whatever I guess. Sorry I dont to talk about fishing. \n\nI am also not loud about my personality guess, I do not use labels I am just me. i find it drains my social battery much faster. my friends were able to help me overcome my sm by pushing me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to comfortably speak freely with them. ifind myself missing be able to be mute around certian people, it was comfortable and safe. Yeah, I feel like a vegetable with no personality sometimes, living in my own world and rarely sharing my thoughts with other people. \n\nMy personality is practically a copy of several people, I struggle \"finding\" myself and I have to mask copying other people personalities and behaviour to socialize properly. Its pretty draining and overwhelming. Kind of, but I also wonder how much of it is that my natural personality led me to SM as a coping mechanism in childhood for the same reasons that I am quiet as an adult. I was a bit older during my most extreme period of SM (9-10), closer to the age that people start to develop eating disorders or addictions if that is their thing. I have also noticed at my age (40ish) that a lot of people revert to those same things when life is extra hard or stressful as adults. Like, someone who struggled with an ED in childhood and got more-or-less \"better\" is still more likely to have food issues when they are struggling or people who have kicked an addiction will relapse. For me, I relapse into SM. I guess I just think that everyone has their \"thing,\" and it probably resurfaces throughout life for many of us, especially if we started young. Yes but it is because it turned out I am autistic and was diagnosed aged 26. It is worth looking into as what you are describing sounds like an autistic trait. Yes. I do not even know who the real me is. I have a personality, I do not know how it would be described though. That said, to everyone but one person I basically do not exist. I do not interact, tend to be expressionless and do not outwardly react to things. I have missed out on so many things I would want to do in theory because I cannot socialise, which is frustratingly an integral part of almost anything. I do not know if it is autism, I am extremely perceptive of others. It is more avoidant personality disorder I do not really have thoughts or opinions... Yes definitely. I just do not naturally say a lot. I am very bad at small talk but I can socialize when I am very focused on that person or group. I have trouble with sporadic small talk throughout the day. But I also have autism so that makes a difference. what caused your SM? i believe mine may have steamed from being told i was too loud as a child and always being scared to speak when not spoken too. it stunted my socialisation severely but like i said in another comment, my friends helped me grow my circle. Yup. I never completely got over SM. Still mostly listening to other people speak instead of chiming in. And the lack of social interaction with others over the years has made it so that I do not have stories to tell ppl. Other people know what restaurants/memes/stores/products are popular and have so many experiences/vacations to chat about, but I have nothing to contribute there Yes. It is extremely better now since I went no contact with my extremely abusive family who caused it. I feel MUCH safer and express myself a ton. I even realized that I am an extrovert. Who knew?", "I would love to go for a drive in my car right now and just listen to music. I am 18 and the car is there for me (in my Dad's name, but \"mine\"), I think my dad even mentioned in the past if I ever wanted to go for a drive I could...but it is been so long, unless my dad legit told me I could the same instance, or saw me out the house to my car....I will not do it. I will not ask, etc. \n\nI am also really tired rn, otherwise I would dive deeper. I only slept 2 hours last night. Just go for the drive. Listening to music and driving is therapeutic. Driving yourself also gives a person so much freedom and growth. Just do it. Drives have knocked a ton of sense into me. If it was not for some of my drives, I would probably be dead. They are very helpful and sometimes I have found myself in weird situations that turn into funny stories.", "Eleven from Stranger Things I identify a lot with Eleven from Stranger Things because she can barely speak.  It makes me so happy to see a main character in a popular show who has so much trouble talking. Me too.", "I had SM, please read this Idk what was wrong with me but as a kid in elementary school I was very outgoing and very talkative and had friends, I never got bullied that much tbh, but it all stopped until I got into 4th grade and that was when I had selective mutism, I had it in 5th grade too but it was only at school and I would only whisper and nod my head when being spoken to by the teacher, outside of school I was comepletelely different, I had few friends I was close to and not to mention I even bullied my one friend  (I regret and feel so bad about it to this day \ud83d\ude14). 6th grade it got somewhat better, but once I got to high school it is more better now but I still have a bad form of social anxiety and I am about to be a senior, sometimes I wonder what is wrong with me. I have no confidence and very low self esteem still to this day. I remember back when I had SM in 4th grade, a girl asked me what happened Bc I was perfectly fine and talkative last year in 3rd grade, and when she asked me that I wrote on a piece of paper that I do not talk anymore Bc I hate the sound of my voice. When I think about it to this day it still seems so odd, also not to mention that I went through trauma from my parents physically fighting and them fighting started back in kindergarten. Hey, a similar thing happened to me. I understand it feels very tough, and we feel like a misfit. I am still trying to find a way to have more confidence and talk to people, in the journey. I think a decent reason as to why I stopped talking around 6th grade truly, although throughout my life I have always had this tendency to avoid speaking unless it was necessary, I was never one to express myself, and that is to family as well. I have told myself it was 6th grade when I stopped normally conversating with my family, but tbh I have never really normally conversated with my family.\n\nBut today, I agree my self-confidence is pretty much not there, same with my self-esteem. My Mom actually brought up meeting this girl to hangout to me, my Dad's been pushing but I have not because that is something I do not discuss with my parents (at 18). I did not give an answer but if I say yes, in this case. It can go somewhere, and I think if I do meet-up it would go one of two ways....great, and I talk the most I have ever in my entire life, and my Reddit spontaneity manifests to my actual life....or bad, and I freeze up and have no clue what to say. I am also very poor when communicating with girls which really started back in 7th grade....before then it was not a big deal. I had problems talking in school, but there was never a fear there. So I also fear I will be way too nervous in the situation, or I will not know what to do....or what to talk about, although I have had some friends who were great at conversating with me. That was about 5-6 years ago. My last friend who I could conversate with was about nearer to 2 years ago (when I last spoke to him)...I forget how it even went.\n\nSo it is like I dive in deep or I do not dive at all. And some days I am very confident, but lately I have not been and I wish I was very attractive (it is not that I am ugly in my opinion), it would just make me feel more at ease. Maybe it is that I feel I am going to have to be relying on a part of me that is not too well polished, my personality and my expressive self. It is not like I am not creative either, I had a YouTube channel that had my whole friend group die of genuine laughter....but that side of me has gone dormant too in the last 2 years.\n\nI feel like I barely know myself these days. And as much as I want to talk and change, lately I have no motive to do either.\n\nEdit: And maybe if I knew I could rely on that part of me, I would not be that phased.", "How can I get my family to understand my gf has SM and there is absolutely nothing wrong with her? So my girl and I (23f and 24f) are in an LDR. She is from Norway but came to stay with me for the holidays in the states, and we have been together for just over a year (known each other for almost 4). \n\nFor thanksgiving she came with me to my parents and met my family for the first time. I told them all multiple times that she has selective mutism and does not talk much, sometimes not at all. My sisters understood, but not so much my parents. I do not think they understood that when I told them she does not talk much that *she really really does not talk much*. My mom kept making sly comments about my gf\u2019s weight (she has an ED) and kept giving me this *look*, like she was trying to figure out why the hell I brought this girl home. My gf did not really pick up on it as much as me bc she was zoned out but I was really protective and felt attacked enough for her. My mom even went so far as to look at my gf and ask almost incredulously *\u201chow old are you?\u201d*, like she thought something was wrong with her and my gf looked shocked but later told me she just thought it was funny. \n\nI am just glad my gf did not notice as much as me because it might have overwhelmed her more than she already was. When we are alone, she talks to me so much and I am one of the few that she can talk the ears off of. She is beautiful and smart and kind and just because she cannot talk sometimes does not mean a single thing is wrong with her. Not to mention she is got to speak in English, which is not even her native language (although she is fluent). \n\nI just want my family to understand and I do not think what I have told them is sticking. I want to talk to them again about it, because my gf is not going anywhere and I love her. My gf and I have my sister\u2019s baby shower to go to this weekend and a lot of people will be there. Does anyone have any pointers for best helping my gf or how I can talk to my mom/family in a way that they understand SM? \n\nProbably going to delete this later so thanks in advance for any help!", "I have not been feeling too well, I just feel lonely no body to talk to and hate I cannot reach out. I just feel tired all day nothing feels right. This past couple of days. I just want to disappear. I feel so sad. I cry. To let out my emotions. Nobody should feel as lonely as I feel. My heart goes out to you. \nI do not have any magic words to make it better, but know if I could take away your loneliness and sadness, I would. \nYou are not alone, I have been struggling with wanting to disappear as well. \nOne day at a time, we can do this. \nWishing you well.

I hope everyone is doing well. :) Here is sort of a random question\u2026 I recently learned of a Paul McCartney song called \u201cShe is Given Up Talking\u201d and it is supposedly about a girl he knew growing up (who some now suspect had SM, even though McCartney did not even know what SM was when he wrote the song.)If you listen to the song, the lyrics really, and might I add, eerily, describe what some people with SM go through\u2026 I was wondering if you or anyone else knows more about this, I know it is random but I am just curious! I might do some more research on this because I think it is really interesting!! Interesting song \u2018suggestion\u2019, I wonder if the 80% instrumental 20% lyrics was on purpose. Mimicking how the girl hardly speaks I thought that was strange too. I do not really know how I feel about the song tbh\u2026 the lyrics are sort of giving me weird vibes like the \u201cBut when she comes home it is yap-a-yap-yap, words are running freely like the water from a tap\u201d, it sounds like a grade school child learning how to make rhymes came up with this. For me, the \u2018story\u2019 was too short. There is hardly any meat to the lyrics. I was hoping for more before the end, but I guess not \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Me too! I guess that is why it is not such a well known song Thank you so much for this! As someone who has got sm this really helps.\n\nAlso I did some research myself and paul mccartney wrote something about it and ill send you the link because its a long quote :)\n\n( Thanks for looking into it!", "Constant job interview rejection Hi guys,\n\nI have SM but can communicate quietly to most strangers when they initiate.

I joined Reddit to post this as I have been feeling along going through life as an Adult with Selective Mutism.\n\nI (36M, Atypical ASD, GAD, Depression, SM) have had a diagnosis of Selective Mutism since I was 11 years old. It was something family and family friends had noticed in me as a toddler and notably failed the 2plus tests that they used to do her in the UK back in the 80s. I  got my diagnosis as I was I struggling to access school in my last year before going to high school.  I had always struggled through school, could not talk etc would cover my mouth and whisper if I could get anything out. I had struggled to go to school since I started at four years old but the need to be compliant and do the right thing was greater than the need to \n\nHigh school was a real struggle and I got worse and moved high school a few times without moving house. The final high school I had friends before I started having a common interest in playing Warhammer Quest and various RPGs. I also had full time support to help make it in any way accessible (I know that now there would be no way someone would get full time support one to one). I ended up only taking 6 GCSEs passing 5 (all science based) as I had dropped out of everything else because teachers would expect me to talk.\n\nAnyways I stumbled through life, been to 4 universities started 4 different undergraduate courses, graduated from ceramics. Ceramics gave me some leeway in talking to strangers as long as it was about art or ceramics.\n\nThen I have postgraduate teaching qualification (which I was almost bullied out of due to struggling with SM throughout). And got my Masters by research as I somehow convinced the university to give me a grant to pay for my tuition. \n\nAlways found work through knowing someone, worked for family a few times, never got a job through interview. The last job I had was making me increasingly ill over the four years that I did it and I finally managed to quit this year. Next day I did my back in and spent a month not being able to stand for more than 5 minutes or sit up at my computer. \n\nSince then I have been pushing to try and make what was a side business of teaching ceramics occasionally (the teaching side is dead in the water until covid is over) and selling what I make. I finally have had time to work on getting that going. My SM does make it hard to write about my work and I have been trying my hardest, but the last few years SM has affected my ability to even post on social media. I have been getting around it this last month by joining everything together on Facebook business and writing all my posts for the week on the day I feel the bravest and just scheduling as much as I can manage till I feel tired.\n\nI have run a business before but I failed due to finding it hard to always having to fight through SM as people came into the shop.\n\nRecently I wrote a fan letter to an artist hero who had through his writing and youtube films had helped me to gather up the courage to quit my job, and I had explained from the onset about SM but most people do not understand. He invited me to join his mentoring course which I decided to try it out. As I went through the classes and the worksheets he had written I started feeling more like myself, braver pushing my work which I have not managed to do all year. I have been on the course for 3 weeks and I finally managed to muster the courage to ask a question which was  basically \"How do I ask better questions? I struggle to answer questions if they are non factual. And what questions should I be asking of myself?\"\n\nThe response boiled down to:\n\n* live from imagination not history. \n* You have to be able to be the fool, \n* always exploring. \n* Why do I always need to be right\n* Find the source of that pain that makes you this way and deal with it.\n* Not going to be a great life if you always live in fear.\n\nThat was on Wednesday of this Week (now Friday) and I have been struggling to get work done I cannot really think of anything else. The progress I made in the three weeks was superficial and flaking at the edges. \n\nThe origin of it all is the selective mutism I went into the sciences originally because I was good at it but also because it was factual, it meant I did not really have to speak to a teacher I could generally just get on with it. Case in point my second high school I went to a school where we would work from workbooks in the morning in individual offices put a flag on top if we needed anything (which I never used apart from asking permission to mark my own work. And in the afternoon we would have taught lessons. Every year I teach myself a new skill because of being an independent learner. Being right has always given me something to hide behind.\n\nSM has caused me to form a persona for work, for out and about, in my business. It is very much a serious one compared to what close friends and family see of someone who messes about and sings loudly as they work, completely out of key, and has a fun time making things.  I do not know how to act the fool how to actually give myself the permission to make truely playful enjoyable work and express that to other people.\n\nI have missed so much in my life due to the SM from friends weddings to giving myself permission to work on what I really want to work on.\n\nI do not know what I want from writing all this, I just am a bit tired of going through this alone feeling like a kid that no one understands (I know I am 36, but it does not make it any easier.) Have you thought about going to counseling?  You may have to try a few counselors before you find one you like, but from what I have seen (I work in the schools and have co-treated with a counselor), the progress you can make with a good counselor who gets you can be truly life-changing.  I have been to counseling myself and I think more people go than most people realize when they are trying to get un-stuck from something in life.  It also seems like continuing your art could be really helpful.  I have found some communities where just being in that nurturing environment is sort of therapeutic and soothing (as well as something it sounds like you want to do anyway) I have had counseling before over the years and as a teenager had a series of student Educational Psychologists which is the only way I manage to go to the dentist.\n\nA year ago I had a free counselor through local services and half way through I explained that I struggled with Selective Mutism which they had never heard of and spend the rest of the session trying to probe me for the original trauma like if she could find that then she could cure me, needless to say she would not let it go and I wanted to talk about other things so I refused any further sessions with her.\n\nA friend recommended a psychoanalyst in Lithuania that they use, and I did spend an hour talking to them, but they could not understand my accent and had not heard of selective mutism either.\n\nThe search to find a counselor that understands/ get on with does continue That is frustrating :/  It seems like you have done lots of things in your life despite the SM.  I am sorry you are struggling. :(  I am sure you have probably seen this before but I wonder if this is helpful, especially now with telepractice?: (  The website says they work with children but I bet at least some of them would work with adults, too.  I am a speech therapist and it seems like finding the right counselor or person to treat SM can be challenging.  It seems like that mentoring class helped you a lot.  Honestly, what we do in therapy (at least from a speech therapy perspective) is making an educated guess on what will help, taking baby steps to do it, and examining if it was helpful and why.

I grew up a really loud and talkative kid. Once I hit about 3rd or 4th grade is when I started to become shy and by 5th grade I stopped talking to family all together. I was bullied by them, they called me mute and asked why I never talked. It made the situation worse. I am 25 now and I am ready to make a change because this fucking sucks. I feel \u201cnormal\u201d when I am not around my family. Sure I am still awkward and have always been known as the quiet person, but I can talk to others who are not in my family. The only time I physically shut down with others (aside from family) and cannot seem to get a word out is when I am upset, I see it happen with my fianc\u00e9 sometimes when he makes me mad or when I feel let down. I do not know why it is so bad around my family. I have not had a full on conversation with them since I was maybe 10? I got really drunk with my brother who is a bartender twice in the past year, and I could not stop talking. I was so embarrassed because I was like, he does not even know me like that? What if he tells my family? \nI am in the process of finding a therapist. But I want to know that I am not the only one who has it really bad with family. My son is this exactly. He is fine with his friends, will talk to teachers if he has to, and even interviewed and got a job training people. But with us, his parents, and his siblings, silence. If he has to talk to us, it is a whisper. He is 18 now and I do not know how to help him. He refuses therapy or meds of any sort. It is so hard to know he used to be so outgoing and fun and playful. Now nothing.", "I need some advice :/ I have sm and I am really nervous for tomorrow. I will give some back round information. On Monday in science class a girl asked if I wanted to join my group and I said yes. But then the next day I missed that day because of things. I realized I had the important paper that they needed and now I am afraid I ruined all of my chances to have a friend or to talk to someone. Tomorrow I have to build like a rollercoaster thing with my group and I am worried I ruined everything and they will never talk to me again. Thanks for reading I just needed to get this out. I am sure they will forgive you. This happens a lot in groups. People get sick and miss school. Things happen, but people forgive you, I promise. If they do not, is that really someone you want to be friends with? Due to my SM and the severity of it, I actually often did this in school. I would join a group in class to only stay home the next day, so they would be stuck working on their own. A lot of the time they did not even notice I had been gone though, because I do not/cannot speak. The difficult part of SM is that even if it is not your fault, you need to speak up and acknowledge what happened up front, because it was frustrating for them not having the paperwork.  From your own words you are a thoughtful and considerate person, but not acknowledging the missed paperwork will make you appear insensitive and callous.  There is nothing worse then being entirely misunderstood because of SM!  You need to bite the bullet and speak up once you see them.  A simple \u201chere is the paperwork, it must have been frustrating not to have it yesterday and I apologize for that\u201d.  You are apologizing because you feel badly that it affected their progress, not because you did anything wrong. Someone with SM cannot exactly just \u201cspeak up\u201d. Selective mutism is not deliberate by any means, so it is not that simple. SM feels like the words are \u201cstuck\u201d. You can form them in your head, but no matter how hard you try, you cannot say them. And if you try to speak, no sound comes out. People with SM actually get paralyzed vocal cords due to their anxiety. Their vocal cords unparalyze and they can speak once they leave and get into a setting where they are comfortable and do not feel anxious. Ok yeah I will try to do that! I probably will not, but I will try and I will tell you if I did it. I am so sorry you are feeling panic, I wish I could give you a big hug.  I can see that you are feeling a lot of different emotions at the same time which must be overwhelming.  This school project is not as important as your emotional health.  Your group, if they knew what you are experiencing would totally understand, and the project, I can assure you, is just fine.  Have you spoken to your parents about how you are feeling?  How do you usually manage anxiety? Yes, this is very true. Sorry I am not good at checking reddit. My parents are really cool they have bad anxiety like me so they understand. I would usually go to the nurse if I felt I was going to explode in class haha. I am really awkward and have no friends so someone talking to me is scary because I forgot how to be a normal person haha. Luckily they were really nice about it I told them about the weird week I was having with all these problems and they understood and I might have a friend now!!!!! Thank you so much for saying nice things to me I am usually the weird kid who nobody talks to so even online someone talking g to me makes me so happy. Thank you so much :D", "What could your teachers have done to make school easier for you? So for example, being allowed to just get up and go to the bathroom instead of having to ask your teacher. It would have been better if they did not mock me for stimming. Not torture me on a daily basis by publicly making fun of me for not talking or talking so quietly that I could not be heard. Not yell at me for not talking. Not go on rants to the class about how people who were not going to participate in class discussions were a waste of space and oxygen. Not try to force me to talk until I was in tears. I had one teacher who did this for me, actually, so I suppose it is not really much of a \"what could have been done\" thing for me. Still, I thought I should contribute since I hope my future teachers/professors will do the same !!\n\nAnyway, my teacher listened to my story and completely understood despite never hearing about SM before. She accepted it, apologized for prior requests to speak, and promised to not make said requests again in the future. Then she offered to talk about it with other teachers, and she did after I accepted. After that, no other teacher bothered me about talking ever again.\n\nMoreover, that teacher accommodated to my needs and structured some of our lessons in a way that would include even me, while still getting our work done (instead of presenting alone in front of the whole class, we were put into small groups to lessen anxiety, and shared our Powerpoints by exchanging devices. From there, we could take individual notes and have a class discussion at the end, with participation in discussion not mandatory). Not separate me from the only person I was comfortable being around. I took it for granted back then, but I had some amazing teachers. I will just mention what they did that made my experience tolerable. \n\nThey accepted my SM as something I had no control over and did not try to force me to speak or fail me for not speaking. I had no more control over it than a student with ADHD or autism or another disorder. \n\nThey encouraged me to be part of class discussion. Even though I did not speak, they found ways to make sure I was engaged in the class and treated me like any other student. \n\nThe came up with creative ways to help me communicate. \n\nThey acknowledged any progress they saw and praised me for it - it was super encouraging. \n\nThey pushed me in different ways. My SM did not exempt me from any assignments. Back to the creative communication methods...they adapted to my SM, but they still made me work just as hard as anyone else. \n\nMainly, they just made sure I fit in. They did not ridicule me, they did not try to force me to speak, they did not write me off as a waste of time. I felt like any other student, just with a quirk that they were willing to work with. Yep. I was bullied a lot too. It is really ugly, forget about the little details that could even be extras when you compare them to this. Teachers are not always basically safe adults. I was bullied a lot throughout the years and even up to university by a lot of the staff. \n\nAlthough I also had amazing teachers who tried to be inclusive and even stood up for me when they saw me being bullied by some of the kids, they might have witnessed ugly behavior on the part of some of the teachers too and took pity on me. Yes. If I am truly to stick to the spirit of the original question, it would have been great if more teachers had done things like allowing me to write down answers to discussion questions, or just doing things to increase inclusivity. For example, I work in a fully inclusive school, and most of us say everything out loud while signing the key words, regardless of which student(s) we are addressing, and we respond to any functional communication, whether that is verbal or sign. Something like having a built in, normalized ASL component to communication like that would have been so helpful for me. But, as much as I wish all education could be inclusive like this, it seems pretty outrageous to expect that when I was bullied by teachers throughout my entire education because I was a little different. Do not pressure me to speak. For the love of god, do not single me out or draw attention to my quietness. Realize that I am not doing this to be difficult or anything of the sort. I was very fortunate to have amazing teachers, but a few of them would put me on the spot while asking a question or doing some class activity. It was as if they thought I was choosing to be silent instead of my mutism being a much more complex issue.\n\nMost teachers would make accommodations for me so I could still participate as much as possible in class. Making sure the student feels comfortable is the #1 priority, in my experience.", "Did SM hold you back academically? Was it harder to concentrate in class? Did teachers dismiss you because you could not answer questions? Are there strategies that helped you and your teachers (not with talking, but with lessons)? School was very hard for me. I spent most of my classes hiding in the bathroom. We worked in groups a lot and since I could not speak to my group I missed a lot of the information they were writing down. What would have helped was allowing me to sit and work with people that I was more comfortable with. And not trying to force me to speak. Definitely. I distinctly remember a class that was graded on three parts: Homework, Tests, and Group Work. First two categories I earned near perfect scores, but if the teacher were to grade me fairly, I would have received a failing grade for group work. If I recall correctly, she inflated my score because she could tell I was struggling. \n\nAside from academic issues like that, sm just made me a target for shoving around. I was either ignored entirely, or people (including teachers) wanted to be /the one/ who pried me out of my shell. This lead to straight up bullying by teachers of all people, who- rather than dismiss me- would repeatedly call on me to the point of overkill. \n\nI did not know what sm was at this time, and clearly no one around me did either. Had anyone known, I think things would have been very different. To someone struggling with it these days, I would recommend printing an information sheet and straight up giving it to any and all teachers. Informing them of what is going on should be key. Oh without question. School was a nightmare for me. With my ADHD and possible SM along with crippling social anxiety, topped with probably OCD it was not enjoyable in any way. I probably could have had much more than the average success I had without these setbacks Fortunately, no. I had a great experience in school academically. I became teacher's pet to most of my teachers because I was quiet and always did my work and did it well. This was embarrassing for me though because I did not want any attention, but teachers loved to call on me even when I did not raise my hand because they assumed I knew the answers. I think they were hoping to draw me out of my quietness but it did not benefit me at the time. That is how I was for the most part, but I was so zoned out I would just read the textbook and get fairly good grades from having a good memory. Foreign languages and upper level math were a nightmare though.    \n\nThe ADD was the biggest part for me so the SM did not cause as many issues. Oh yeah me too. Math was the absolute worst, I have never hated something more in my life than I hate math. \n\nYeah that was my biggest struggle as well, just losing focus Some teachers acted as if I was doing this deliberately and were angry (even though I was diagnosed by a professional and they knew it). I am quite happy with what I achieved but I feel like without SM and social anxiety maybe I could have done even better. I had SM throughout preschool to the end of elementary school. In my case, I was completely unable to speak to any adults other than my parents. Honestly I am probably one of the more lucky ones because my teachers were informed of my SM before the school year started, and they all tried to accommodate me as best as they could. I am grateful for how kind and understanding they all were. They never called on me or forced me to speak verbally, and as a substitute they would give me a white board or post it notes to write down things if I wanted to ask them questions (about an assignment, going to the bathroom, etc). I was a pretty good student overall, but of course I did not participate in class discussions or anything like that. Oh, and I had no problem talking to my friends and classmates at all, in fact I was a little too chatty lol... Sorry for off topic, but I just remembered this one time I was arguing with one of my table mates on how you pronounce \u201cscarce\u201d and the teacher walked by and said \u201cactually, it is pronounced scarce\u201d and I felt so embarrassed that she heard me speak lol.. I mean she probably heard my voice many times but it was the first time she said anything about it. I had concentration problems and very little group work to worry about until college, and even then was minimal because I started out in engineering.  I had a lot of sinus problems that I effected me too and could not ask for help about. I was mostly ignored except when I got sinusitis, which was stress induced. Sorry, many attempts were made to post. In a way. I mean I had a point where I stopped going to school completely because of the anxiety it caused. They put me into this online program that was really boring and hard to concentrate on. My grades really slipped in that program. \n\nWhen it comes to being in class I could never ask questions to anyone when I was confused so that kind of sucked. Also when it came to group learning projects I just kind of zoned out and could not pay attention to anything going on around me. Just wanted to say thank you for the feedback. It is very helpful in understanding what my daughter might experience. Fellow parent here!  For 7th and 8th grade, my daughter got a 504 plan, which was a special accommodation.  It was set up so that her teachers would allow her to do solo presentations during lunch instead of in class and for group things, do less speaking than the other kids.  For the most part, it was great! Yes. I am a college drop out because of it. no, no, and no. I got really good grades and got accepted into a private school that requires good grades and such, but in the speaking part of my report card I got.... not good scores. But they improved as I got older! Yeah, this is exactly my experience in school so far. I wouldnt say SM held me back academically. However, I believe my SM was directly related to the trauma I experienced as a young child which also caused me to disassociate in school. I actually could talk to my teachers mostly, not always. Not as much as my peers. My selective mutism showed up more so in the community. But I did have times where I just could not answer questions. However, I was supported in school through learning services and an Individual Education Plan which addressed my unique needs.", "Cannot talk about feelings? I can usually talk (even though I am usually awkward) and there are only certain situations where I feel unable to. The biggest one is when someone needs me to talk about my emotions. I will imagine what I want to say, think it over and over, but am not able to say it out loud. I have been in relationships where we will just sit there in silence for like 20 minutes while I try getting the courage to speak. I never understood exactly why but now think it is selective mutism. I think this started when I was a child and when my dad would yell at me, the only thing that got to him was me not speaking at all. Now at 26 I still cannot articulate my feelings out loud.", "My aftermaths and forced relapsation of selective mutism. Hey, you can call me bao! \n\nFirst things first, I am sorry if my English goes completely crazy, it is not my first language!\n\nSo, to finally start, a few years ago I had an incident that I do not want to go into detail about due to the trauma it caused for me. However, it also affected my vocals a lot and caused my voice to get, in my opinion, a lot more ugly and harder for me to talk louder, and in addition to my puberphonia(female(yes girls can have it, it is just not talked about since it is okay to have a high pitch voice as a girl)) it is not a really good combination. Therefore, I now got bullied for two things regarding my voice, which made me become a selective mute for several years.\n\nDue to this, my vocals never got to the point of recovery and nowadays I still usually only communicate via voice if really needed or talk to others by using my phone or notes. I use social games like VRChat to compensate for my non-existent social life, although I am not very successful in there as well because I even get bullied there. People tell me how unpleasant and weird my voice is and how they get uncomfortable by me talking to them and that I sound like some horror movie child. Some also fetishise my voice really bad, but I do not want to talk about that at all. IRL I also get told the same, but in addition, I also get bullied because of my race, since I live in a majorly White country.\n\nI am really eager to talk to people. I wish I could talk to everybody and try to be friends with them, but society still blocks me off and I get more demotivated as the days pass and struggle with the ever-growing thought of just being quiet again. That is why I am afraid that I will get relapsed back into selective mutism. My parents neither are not a big help, because they might be nice to me but they barely have any time for me since they are hard-working. Oh, and yeah, I do know that there are people that are not bullies, but it is also still hard to get to those because 95% of the time they do not understand me. They just give up on me because of that, nodding their heads even though they do not even know what I have said.\n\nThe thing I need help with is to find out how I can fix my vocal issues. I know, it sounds pretty easy to solve and I have already got told by several doctors and therapists that I should just go and talk to people, but it is not as easy if people do not want to talk to you. I have also done things like vocal stages and talking to myself, but it is just depressing because it feels like I am getting pressed into my face how people do not want to talk to me and nobody wants to do them with me neither, which makes me feel terribly lonely. I also really would like to know if somebody with the same issue even exists, because I have never seen another person with the same vocal struggles as I have. \n\nI really hope one of you guys can help me and thanks for reading this far! I also apologise if some of my wording or my grammar might be confusing and I hope that I have understandably worded everything. boosting this in hopes it will get traction I have similar social issues and consider voluntarily giving up speaking. I am currently facing legal trouble because someone misunderstood something I said and filed a report.\n\nI find writing/typing is better generally, but I do have a few close friends I talk to. They have become accustomed to my voice and understand me fairly well. Giving up really is no option to me. I want to make friends with a lot of people and I want to talk to them, and for that I would like to try my best to improve again!\n\nWriting is very laborious and it feels like a shame and just another reason for people to not befriend me, so I want to stop that.\n\nThanks for commenting though! c: Have you heard about AAC? I have, but it is very embarassing to use for me. TTS also is not really an option because it is laborious and as humiliating as AAC.  \nI am sorry! Thank you for the help tho! :3 I am adult with mild SM that has kind of relapsed with the pandemic and not being able to talk to people in person/knowing what I say behind a mask without any facial expression could be easily misunderstood and a dozen other anxiety reasons, lol. \n\nAnyway, i also experienced a medical problem that effected my voice a lot for a while. Essentially I lost my voice due to a side-effect of taking an anti-biotic improperly. For about 2.5 years I would lose my voice intermittently. I also lived with opera singers at this time who were vocal coaches. They told me that when my vocal cords repaired themselves from the trauma I should start doing singing exercises. So this is what I did and still do. I am super embarrassed to do them (they sound very silly and weird) where anyone at all can hear me so I do them in my car while parked in an empty place. I use youtube videos or spotify playlists of voice warm up exercises. I try do this about 3 times a week for an hour each time. My voice is better than ever now! If i had the money I would just take voice lessons, but i do not.\n\nBut my SM has a become a big problem for me lately at work. I have a new-ish job where I need to speak to a lot of people in non-prepared statements. I can talk lucidly with most anyone but in this context I find it really difficult. Having only recently found out about SM and realizing I have it and have had it my whole life to some degree I am now starting to take steps to help it. \n\nWhat I am trying now everyday: reading out loud 20 minutes of shakespeare sonnets. Then reading out loud 20 minutes of a text that has lots of phrases on the subjects I need to be talking on at work. Shakespeare is just a warm up--I do not know what half of it means and have the diction and cadence wrong but am getting better each time I have done it. I am thinking practicing speaking out loud  a variety of subjects and words and getting used to it again will help me a lot. You might want to give it a try using texts that have things in them you want to be talking about. I have previously gone very long periods of time without talking hardly at all. It made it even more difficult for me because not only is my mind preventing me from speaking but my vocal chords were so weak I had to force my small voice out. Talking to myself out loud at home as often as possible helped me regain control in my voice. I even read my books out loud to my dog. When watching tv I will repeat outloud phrases I thought were funny, interesting, or to mimic their accent because it is amusing. It may all seem silly but its helped me regain some confidence in my speech. Basically like self guided vocal therapy. I understand puberphonia is not quite the same as my issue but I think practicing as much as possible would also be beneficial to you. It can feel very awkward to talk to yourself at first if that is not something you do naturally. But it is a habit you can force into to place. \n\nI do not think the bullying will stop. People are so cruel. My only advice is to learn to comfortably express \u201cthat is because I have a condition called puberphonia\u201d anyone who gives you criticism beyond that point is just a jerk and would have been a jerk to you regardless. There is a girl on tik tok with a very high pitched voice. She gets a lot of criticism but she also has a large following that are very supportive. I wish I remembered her name so you could look her up and observe how she approaches it.\n\n\nEdit because I missed the part about how you tried talking to yourself and it made you depressed. I am going to assume you are young. My apologies if I am incorrect. I have been in that boat my whole life. My only advice is to learn to find comfort in solitude and become your best friend. You WILL make friends at some point in your life. People will come and go in your life constantly. Make your hobbies your comfort zone. And animals. Whatever makes you feel ok alone.  And be patient. I know your longing for companionship. It will come one day. But longing for hurts so much it is not worth it. Halloo!  \nI will definitely try reading texts out loud again, but I do not know how fast I will give up on that since I hate doing things like that by myself. I usually feel lonely if you I do so!  \nThank you for your tips and your help tho! :3 Hey!! Thank's for your motivating words! :D  \nYeah, I am still young! To be honest, I probably would not care a lot about friends leaving if it was easier for me to make friends. And it is not really about the fact that I am afraid of talking to people because of my voice anymore, but because they do not like my voice enough to listen to me. I get that told on a daily by the people I meet and it demotivates me of talking or trying to make friends at all.  \nI cannot make my hobbies my comfort zone because all my hobbies consist of social interaction with other people except for simple stuff like playing the guitar and all that, but I spend most of my time on social games and video games and studying for school, and in most video games and of course social games as well you have to interact with other people, but they usually do not want to interact with me! :/  \nOh, and those that do often tend to not understand me and give up on me.\n\nI really thank you for reading the whole text though. I was afraid that most people would not even go passthe second paragraph and it kind of feels like that, although I thank them and you for taking the effort to try and help me! c:", "Twin with selective mutism I am a student from Poland and I am looking for twins with selective mutism. I am writing my master's thesis on such a topic. I would like to talk to the twins about their experiences in school and kindergarten.  There is not much information about selective mutism in twins in the Polish literature, so I decided to raise this topic in my thesis. If you would like to take part in my study I would be grateful. If you are a parent of a wonderful twin let me know,please, your experience will also contribute a lot. Best regards Kate I am not sure if I can be of much help, but I am a twin whose diagnosed with SM, although as far as I know my brother is not diagnosed with any disorder.\nI am 26 now and my memory of kindergarten is non existent. And honestly I barely remember much before highschool.\n\nBut if I can help you in any way I would be happy to I have sm but my twin sister does not, tho we both had trouble talking growing up since we mostly just talked to each other. &gt;I am not sure if I can be of much help, but I am a twin whose diagnosed with SM, although as far as I know my brother is not diagnosed with any disorder. I am 26 now and my memory of kindergarten is non existent. And honestly I barely remember much before highschool.\n\nHi, thank you for your reply. I am sure any conversation will be helpful for my research. I need a few days to arrange the questions in English. And if you agree to the interview, I will be very happy. Regards Kate \r  \nHi, thank you for your reply. It is fascinating with twins that sometimes they do not need words to communicate, or they only talk to themselves. That is why I want to dedicate my master thesis to twins.  I am sure that any conversation will be helpful in my research. I need a few days to arrange the questions in English. And if you agree to the interview, I will be very happy. \n\nRegards \n\nKate Me and my twin u/simonoel have selective mutism. You may also want to look up the twins June and Jennifer Gibbons I would be good with that! We actually developed a language among ourselves according to my parents, lmao, like nobody understood us but we sorta understood each other. My twin and I just turned 36 today and we both had selective mutism which was called elective mutism at the time. We overcame that but still struggle with severe social anxiety.", "i may have sm?? ", "I am not sure if I have SM or not, but I know I do not want to speak Hi. I am a member of the discord, but I did not want to leave a huge wall of text in #selective-mutism or something so I am just leaving it here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been looking at the subreddit and the discord for a few days now and I am not really sure if I have SM or not, so I guess I am making a post to get some outside perspective ? Mm ..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was younger I was in a bit of a high-stress environment. As a young kid it was fine, but there were a lot of changes that happened when I was around 12 and from then on my anxiety skyrocketed and has never really recovered. But for quite some time I was unable to speak to my parents and siblings, except for one, who I would respond to. I was really afraid of them and I would been relentlessly picked on by everyone so I just stopped talking so as to give them nothing to throw back at me. It did not really stop there, though, because my parents would make threats if I would not speak. Even then, I mostly just nodded or gave \"yes/no\" as replies. Still, all of that drove me to self-harm and I think that was one of the most traumatizing moments of my life.  \n\n\nI no longer had a desire to speak. I stopped at school, too, although that was more short-lived -- I did not want to get into any more trouble because I was deathly afraid of the consequences. I wanted to be perfect and invisible at the same time so that nobody would ever bother me. So I returned to speaking while in school and just dealt with it. I did not really have friends IRL but I had plenty online and so that was okay; I never had to speak around them, although I did once every few months when I felt ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today .. I still rarely speak. I will respond when spoken to, but I do not really like it. Often times there are conversations going on around me and even if I have something to say and sort of want to add to it .. I just respond in my head over and over until someone addresses me specifically or the topic changes and the opportunity is lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I read this it sounds like I am just really anxious and socially avoidant, and I think that is true, but also -- I do not want to speak. Period. The only reason I do is because I am more afraid of the consequences of not speaking than I am of using my voice .. Additionally .. it feels as though I am doing a disservice to those who truly cannot speak due to some physical issue. For those reasons I feel ashamed to claim that I am mute and instead just go out of my way to only ever be around the few people I feel comfortable speaking around (or who will primarily speak for me) and if I cannot manage that then I will not do anything at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI often wish I was simply born mute with some physical condition so that it was simple and irrefutable. But instead I feel I have to speak or I will fail as a person because there is no documentation suggesting that I need assistance; I will not pass my classes, people will dislike me, I may lose financial support from my parents. On top of that .. I do not want anyone to recognize me and force me to speak because they know that I physically can. That is truthfully one of my biggest concerns. I suspect if I ever move I may try to start my life as a full-time mute but .. regardless .. these are the details I want to record for you people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not really sure where this places me and there are plenty of things I could add (like how sometimes I feel okay to talk around certain people while most of the time I do not) but .. I did not want this to be so lengthy that it was a deterrent. I am not diagnosed with anything, given my financial situation, and as such I am here on reddit trying to figure things out for myself. Let me know what you think. If you have any specific questions then you are welcome to ask or DM me ..   \n\n\nThank you : ) Im no expert in this, but someone who got diagnosed when 4 years old and I have managed to overcome it. (Sorry for potential errors, english is my second language)\n\nSounds like a combination of Anxiety and Depression. You mentioned that you do not want to speak but you can speak when spoken too. SM depicts the inability to speak in many situations, even if you want to. \n\nI often wanted to say things but *could not* \\- you sound like you could speak but do not *want* to due to some sort of trauma. I do not know if there is a major difference in the diagnosis, but it does not sound like direct SM to me, then again, I am no expert. Feel free to correct me though if I understood you wrong.\n\nSome professional help may be useful either way and best of luck in your adventure to fight against it! Anxiety and depression certainly are things that I deal with. I think when I was younger I might have had SM, given that back then it felt like there was no real option, but now it is kind of just my way of life. I have gotten 'better' but ..   \n\n\nIt is as I said -- I do not -want- to speak most of the time and it is difficult to get over it even if I try. Like, words just get 'stuck' in my head. But even still .. I do not have any desire to verbally communicate with those people anyway, so I feel like I am in some weird, gray area at best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, I read how people describe SM and I can only partially relate -- for me it feels like it comes in episodes. Some days I am fine to speak a little and it will take a lot out of me but I will be okay, other days I will sit there feeling as though I cannot speak on my own and need someone to drag me out of it, and other times (the majority of the time) I just do not want to communicate verbally so I avoid people IRL because non-verbal communication is pretty awkward for me. Additionally .. I do not even know if I want to change .. ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is strange and that is why I am trying to find something that I fit the mold of. I do not know if I ever will but .. it would be easier to describe and more accepted by others so that is a large part of my interest in this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless, thank you for your response : ) I have had SM since I was 3 or 4, I am in no way an expert, but to me it does not really sound like SM. When you have SM you want to speak to everyone but the anxiety keeps you from doing so. I am no doctor or therapist or anything like that, but ti me it sounds like maybe a mix of some other type if anxiety, trauma and maybe depression? I would try to get in touch with a therapist if that is a possibility for you and ask them:) or if you cannot do that, maybe ask your doctor? I hope you figure it out and that your life gets easier\u2661 overall, it looks closer to depression and maybe some anxiety rather than selective mutism. like others have said SM happens even when you really want to talk but you just cant. when i still had SM, my fight or flight response was triggered basically every time i was prompted to talk, yet i was absolutely unable to say anything no matter how hard i willed myself", "I will be your voice. I am a recovered selective mute. / Asperger's kid or whatever the want to call me. But hey, at least putting letters on people makes it easier to find threads like this. I hope at least one of you will read. Thank you. \n\nThis is my rant response to someone who said I sound crazy based on my posts (I only am spreading love, truth and awareness so please do not just brush my message of as crazy). Someone who said they think I need to go see a therapist. I kind of laughed out loud because I have seen several and NOW people say I should. Not when I should have gotten a proper therapist/social worker to help me understand my gift. Anyway. Love to you all. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI actually cannot stop speaking now. \n\nAnd people seem to want to listen, for real. r/blind is the Reddit thread where people see the world the most real and those are really intelligent people, they listen. They care.\n\n\n\nRead up on it a little, it is only the top of the iceberg however because like it says, no cause is really known for real. How could it be? When noone listens to those who have it.\n\n\n\nHypersensitive people who cannot shut their brain or heart off. \n\nI hope you mean well with your comment, but please educate yourself before writing. Sensitive people can think you have an actual idea of what you are talking about, but you do not. &lt;--- Directed at the commentor who said I should see a therapist because I write \"love \u2764\ufe0f\" after sentences. \n\nWhere is the world at, that I am crazy for trying to spread love? For always saying the truth or rather not speaking at all.\n\nI have seen maybe 10 different therapists/psychologist my entire life and none of them in my childhood, even though that is when I was completely mute in school. \n\nThis was not by conscious choice, I was only a small child trying not to get yelled at or looked at funny because I was telling the truth or seeing the beauty in the world around me. \n\nYou think these are strange things that I am posting? I always thought the fact that you who never once asked yourself \"why is this small child hiding under couches and choosing not to/ unable to speak from fear of hurting others or having to be looked at strangely another time?\"\nI find those people more strange than me. Those who do not seem to even think about it?\n\nDo you ever leave your own reality? Because every single person has their own you know.\n\nNow I have had 10 since I turned 13 and refused to go to school anymore. I locked myself in my room. I did not speak to my mother anymore. I did not want her to even look at me. I was confused. I did not feel like I had a choice. Now you see, imagine being someone ultra sensitive in a world of rocks bashing against you. Imagine that you are in someone else's shoes. \n\nNow, I was never diagnosed. They simply thought I was the strange one I guess my entire childhood. Every adult, every teacher, every classmate.\n\nSo from 13, years, when I completely crashed, unable to leave my room even for weeks, I have had maybe 10 different therapists, they would circulate because everyone was moving to Stockholm for work. They never had the time to get to know me. The only person who even mentioned Asperger's was a newly graduated young man who asked if I wanted to take an IQ test. I did. I had Asperger's. I am amazed at myself for even doing the test. I had refused to ear properly for weeks, I could not sleep. A doctor said a few years later my iron levels were so low that he was surprised I could even stand up, if I had been an adult I would have been unable to get out of bed. Exhausted, drained, without food, without sleep, without anyone who would listen, I took a test and he said I did amazingly great. He had not been able to drag anything out of me but maybe he saw my eyes that kept glancing at the corner. That I was scared to look him in the eyes to see how he thought I was crazy. I have lost count for how many I saw but only 3 of them did any good, the others caused me more harm. They told my mom to unscrew the door to my room. I never got to have any sense of privacy or safety. But I pulled through. Despite them. The drugs they pushed down my throat made me want to die. I was cutting all over my arms. Noone still would listen. Years of this shit.\n\nI pulled through despite everyone else seemingly (they do not mean harm, they just do not have the awareness you do.) wanting me not to.\n\n(I repeat! They do NOT mean harm, they just do not have the awareness you do. We need to spread it. I will do my best.)\n\nWell except the young graduate, he seemed to really care and understand. He had to move to Stockholm though.\n\nHere I am 10 years later, still breathing,\nAnd I feel confused looking around. \n\nHow am I always the most energetic in the room?\n\nWhy am I the one singing in the buss, drumming to my music. Closing my eyes in the rays of the sun?\n\nMaybe because I had to cope with the fact that I only had myself against the world, only needed myself and that safety. I do not know. I know now I want to join the world to spread awareness. Because we should learn how to treat people like people. You deserve to be treated \"normal\" and you deserve to speak. You have so many brilliant ideas and thoughts. I want to listen.\n\nI want to listen. You are not crazy, you are not weird. You are not. You are amazingly unique. \n\nSo after that entire horrible journey, I have finally at 23 years of age emerged strong as a fucking diamond. From all the pressure. And I have some brilliant ideas to fix this world.\n\nFinally being an honest person had some sort of golden lining.\n\nThe recent therapist, I saw a few months ago, she was the best one yet, she actually finished my healing from the trauma of my childhood forced mutism by my surroundings. She was not a therapist, she was just a social worker. She gave me so many good strategies to think about with coping with stress. \n\nI am normal today. I speak the most in class, I write the most online. I see myself as 100% healthy. It is the world that needs help. \n\nIf you read through this entire post, then I applaud you. You managed to stare the through in the face. I want the world to change for the 1% of kids like me, who are not even diagnosed, no help, but they get treated like shit. By people who look at them like they are crazy when they are just honest and very sensitive to emotions. They think all night, they ponder existential questions. They want to know how to help their family not scream and lie.\n\nI am happy, I will never be silenced again. If I go mute again this time it is by choice, because I want to be a voice for those kids, teenagers, adults, elderly. \n\nAwareness. Love. Acceptance. Tribe. Goodnight. \u2764\ufe0f I resonate with this so much. I was never diagnosed with selective mutism, instead a bunch of other things that probably were never even the problem, but symptoms. I am wondering if this was what was holding me back all those years, and still is in some situations. I have so much to share with people and sometimes I just cannot bring myself to verbalize it. I am 19 now and in most situations I can at least manage socially, I am really proud I can work with how reclusive and silent I was all my life. I actually had no idea what selective mutism was until recently because there is still certain situations I still just cannot bring myself to talk other than a few sentences that most people in the room cannot even hear anyway. With all that this post made me smile, a lot of people will never understand and it is so nice to see stuff like this, kind of like \"happy endings\" I guess. It gives hope. Thank you :) I truely know how it feels. You are normal, there just is not a school system in place for People like us. There is not a single thing in society for us. No manual how to manage life when your mind is exploding, and your heart is hurting for a freaking cartoon animal in that movie you saw as a kid. I cried alot every time I watched sad movies. I still do. But now I know I am not crazy, and I know I am not alone, and that changes everything. \n\nThank you for being so brave and sharing with me, I Bellevue You Also have so many ideas. We are just never heard it seems. Maybe because I can survive on next to no sleep or food and still have the fire in me to write all of these things. You do too. \n\nIt is not an ending, I would like to describe my life as a song instead. I just hit the chorus. And I am going to use my voice to sing like my life depends on it. I am going to live in the now.\n\nIf you would like, I would really like chatting with you for a bit when you have time. You are the first person I have ever met in my life who I now know definitely have the same \"condition\" as me. That means so much. I do not feel as alone anymore. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI think I can sleep now, it is 5:38 in the morning haha, I am still not tired but I will try. Because if I burn myself out then I cannot be of any use to you, or myself really. \n\nI want to have an honest conversation with someone like me, pm or discord. But it Will have to be another day.\n\nOnce again, thank you for responding. Goodnight. \ud83d\ude0c Your words bring me hope. Do you have advice for a parent of two girls (aged 6 and 9) with SM? We are trying to slowly introduce verbal communication to teachers and others but therapy is really expensive where we live.\n\nKeep up the awesomeness. I am the person that claimed OP was \"crazy\". I did not. I based my judgement that OP may do well to seek help from the number of threads she has created in the last 24 hours that essentially say versions of the same thing\u2014that she feels she has recovered from mutism and suicidal thoughts. I suggested that seeing a therapist might be advantageous before reading that she had seen several therapists; if I had known that, I would not have suggested it, however I do not think it was an unreasonable thing to suggest on an internet forum like this one.\n\nHowever, I must state that I find OP's thoughts on blind people as a whole to be quite inappropriate. You cannot stereotype a group of people. Saying that all blind people are good listeners and see the world in a special way is completely untrue. Blind people do not see the world in any special way\u2014we are not saints or clairvoyants. Your words bring me hope too. Goodmorning. :')\n\nI do not have a manual, I can only say what I think I personally would have wished my mother would have done. She meant well but she did not get this information. She should have stopped listening to everyone else besides me, if she really wanted to help me. A kid can still know where it hurts, they know something is not \"okay\". Tell them that everything is okay, they are normal. If they are mute, chances are they stopped speaking because they could sense your worry when they opened their mouths. \n\nI cannot explain how they would sense it, even if you use kind words, they will know you think they are \"crazy\". They probably just want to be honestly 100% listened to like they are completely normal like you or me.\n\nBecause they are. They need to get to feel like they are human too, their existential questions matter. Maybe pause the incessive forcing need for them to go to school right this instant. They need to rebuild faith of the world, they are confused. The world is chaos for them. And their parents are spiraling, noone seems to know what to do. They are scared for you. For the world.\n\nYou say one thing, but the look on your face says another. Just take your kids side over anyone else's. If someone says to remove their door and they say \"please do not\". Then do not. Ask them what they are thinking and feeling. Ask them what they want. And be calm, genuine. Chances might even be that they are worried for YOU. If you look hopeless, they lose hope. You are probably the only person who will listen to them right now. Noone will listen to a kid anymore. We believe we are all so high and mighty as adults. But are we?\n\nMost of the things you can read in my profile, I know these things before, as a kid. I was just confused why I was the one in need of help.\nI was confused why every other kid seemed to bully me. Why I was the one called crazy. I seemed to do everything wrong, I failed the \"test\" of being a normal human being. I am the 1%, ofcourse I Will fail the \"test\". But that does not make me any less normal, sane or real.\n\nI can keep going with my own thoughts, I am not saying to take these as truths. But if it is something you have not tried before, what is the harm in being a calm, genuine and loving person and asking them \"honey, what is wrong?\"\n\nThank you for reading, and being so brave for your kids. I can tell you really love them. \u2764\ufe0f Omg! You must be the only person in my \"quarantine\" that can see my posts then! Thank you man, you actually read them? Wow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI completely agree with you. I am against ALL stereotyping. Period. You are just people, human like me, everyone unique but completely fucking normal. Thank you. You put words on my thoughts. :) I think the reason that people are not replying to your posts is that some of them are being deleted. They are visible on my page, if I did not question why not a single person had a negative comment or whatever I would never even think I am in a quarantine. But I have posted walls of text in several different reddit threads for my \"tribe\" and not a single upvote, not a single comment. I have begged people to PM me, to comment, nope. Silence. Only from r/blind and r/dead reddit and r/ADHD reddit, but even then only a hand full of people. I am not sure how to interpret that so I went into the reddit rules and there is a small section called \"quarantine\". And yes, I am whitelisted for everyone to be able to write to me. And yes I am activated for everyone to be able to see my posts. Anyone. I will post what it says here: \n\nQuarantined communities\n\nOn a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited, average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit Administrators may apply a quarantine.\n\nThe purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit\u2019s Content Policy and remain subject to enforcement measures.  \n\nQuarantined communities will display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content. They generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Reddit may also enforce a number of additional product restrictions that exist currently or as they may develop in the future (eg removing custom styling tools).  \n\nModerators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. I am still confused why you think you are quarantined rather than your posts being deleted.\n\nAlso, from the way I read the section of text you posted, subreddits can be quarantined, not individual accounts or threads. However, I might be incorrect.\n\nYou may find some people willing to listen to you on r/self or r/autism, though I will warn you that although these are popular subreddits, there is a high chance that you may receive a lot of down votes, and your post on r/autism may even be deleted. But since you are insistent on wanting to be heard, you could try these subreddits. I can show a screenshot of my screen if you want, they are not deleted. I have had posts deleted before, they are not deleted. I was banned of r/depression the first night I posted there. I do not know what that means either. I just feel like I am being censored again, like my entire life until recently. I have written 2 posts in r/Aspergers but noone responded there either, no comments. Nothing. And my friend also has Asperger's, they are deleted on his screen. Here is a sneak peek of /r/aspergers using the ( of the year!\n\n\\#1: (  \n\\#2: (  \n\\#3: (\n\n----\n^^I am ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ( ^^| ( ^^| ( Oh my fucking God. I just commented to 6 people in those threads to please fucking read my posts because I want to support these beautiful people who hate themselves because noone will listen. \n\nAnd they are all gone, not even a \"deleted\" trail left. I am not crazy, I am being quarantined. Live censored. And I will not fucking have it anymore. I have donated more than half of my income this month to save the fucking rainforest because those rich assholes at the top will not donate even 1% of their fucking income to try to save the species. And I am being censored???? For having too much introspection and empathy????? Wow, thank you! Have a great day! The only advice I can give is to not pressure them into communicating in ways that they cannot. It is extremely important to take baby steps. Pressuring someone with SM to speak will do so much more harm than good, and it can even cause them to regress. Other than that, treatment for SM entails exposure therapy, medicine, cognitive behavioral therapy, school support, and understanding from family/friends. I read this when i was on weed. I wish I could be too to be honest, hard to sleep. Hard to shut brain off.. any tips otherwise? \ud83d\ude02 Why is this getting downvotes constantly? How much do love yourself? Honestly, I do not know. I am always pondering. I think I do love myself 100% when it comes to my honesty and pride and stuff.. and justice. \n\nSending the question right back at you. :) I think you are 100% right. We have been reading about exposure therapy and trying to figure out a good reason to be in class to do exposures with my 4th grader. I feel like if we just tell her that we are trying to help her be more comfortable speaking, she will be more anxious about it, therefore making it worse. A lot of messed up young people in Sweden. I wonder why. Actually, I have never met another person in my life like this here in Sweden. The first person I have talked to like this was here on Reddit a few days ago, an American. I wonder why..\n\nThank you for answering, Love and light to you. \u2764\ufe0f \"I am 100% honest and unfiltered.\"\n\nThat is a red flag for me. No offense but that is usually ego talking. When I feel like that I know it is time to knock my ego down a peg and dissolve it. Psychedelic therapy helps a lot with that for me...total ego dissolution. That is a radical approach but I think everyone has an ego obviously and when it runs rampant and takes over your entire perspective its time to put the ego back in its place.\n\nI hope you do not take offence to this comment because I have felt that way too and for me it is a red flag that my ego is running wild. The rest of your post sounds almost manic, grandiose, and ego driven too. Our ego is good...its necessary to maintain sanity. But when it gets to the point of running the entire show then it is time to open your perspective up. I take no offense, thank you for speaking up about the important things. Truely, I will In my personal life before I would not speak, and by effect that is lying. Also I have tried lying before too. It hurts. So EVERYTHING I have written now here for you guys to read, listen to or whatever.. feel. It is real. It is. It is not my ego, it died long ago I think.. you can call me \"Emo\". Thank you. Peace. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\u270c\ufe0f \u270c\ufe0f \u270c\ufe0f I am a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

I have an anxiety disorder called selective mutism, this anxiety disorder is apart of me, and I have grown up with it from a young age (assuming this). Selective mutism effects my talking, it does not mean I cannot talk, it just effects certain situations where I can become too anxious to talk. Ooh thank you Hey, DM me.

Sorry but my native language is not english so my essays arent going to be in english, but thank you for offering help though :) No problem. In that case, you got this.

You are exactly right! That is a step in the right direction. Congratulations!", "what was your school-time like? did you have friends? were you bullied? did you know you had selective mutism? I had a small group of friends, I struggled to keep them year-to-year and mostly was absorbed by a new group each year. I was bullied mostly by a boy at my daycare, for being... a girl. So not because I was quiet. I was bullied in grade 6 by another group of boys, but mostly for being weird I think. The kids who were my friends that year thought it was weird they were picking on me because I did nothing and never made a scene....\n\nAnd no, it only occured to me to google and find a word for this a few years ago. I was a child of the 90s and you know what that means, unless kids were disrupting the class no one got help. My teachers KNEW I had a problem, and for my early years of elementary school my reading assessments were done privately with a different teacher and in an empty classroom.\n\nI am relatively okay now as an adult, I definitely have my struggles, but I have managed to find ways to overcome them and like, not be in a job that requires me to speak to strangers for the most part. I definitely burnout, among other mental health issues, in my late teens and early 20s from working in customer service jobs through university and really... that was not good :/ It was not the best, but it was not horrible either, I got bullied a little bit. But the main issue was teachers, they knew about my SM, but thought it could be fixed but getting me to talk to people. Which would just send me into full blown panic attacks, so uneducated teachers definitely made it hard. My school time was a good 30 years ago. We did not know what was wrong with me all they knew was that I was \"shy\". \n\nMaking friends was not easy because who wants to play with the girl who cannot speak? I did manage to get a friend and we were friends from 5 years old to 10. When I was 10 we were in the same class (I am from a small island so we usually have the same classmates from Kindergarten to High School) and the teacher was getting upset that I was whispering in class with my friend so she separated us, my maternal grandmother also passed that year and I just fell into the cracks I guess. I was held back and my friend moved on to 6th grade while I was still in 5th. She had other friends and she kind of drifted off with them. Different grades do not have the same lunch period and we did not live in the same neighborhood so that was that. I started by myself until Jr. High second 7th grade (I was held back again) where I somehow made another friend. I lost that friend when we went to High School. I went to one High School and she went to the other. In High School I hung out with my older cousins, younger cousins, and my brothers. My oldest sisters went to the other High School because that is where the \"gifted\" kids went. My school was the old public school, broken down and people do not really care about it. \n\nAs for bullies, it began in kindergarten when I was 4, being quiet made me a really good target and this girl was bigger than me and she tormented me daily. She ended up stabbing me with a pencil to see if I would cry but I did not. My parents moved me to another school for 1st grade where I picked up not one but three bullies. Two boys who would push me around and laugh and one girl who never pushed me around but ended up molesting me in the school cafeteria during an assembly.\n\nElementary was hell for me, Jr. High was not too bad because there was a library and i started there all the time reading. High School was the best because I was speaking a bit and had my brothers and cousins with me. They were very protective and I was never bullied or treated badly but I would never want to go back to it. I worked really hard Jr. High to High School just to get out of there. Yes, no, and kind of....\n\nThe friends I made always came to me, I was never the one to make friends on my own. There were some Assholes, but never anyone that I would call a bully, which you would think so.\n\nI really did not know I was a 'selective mute' until about 10th grade. I think it was long known, I was just never told about it. And I denied it being the case although it was obvious. It wasnt too great. I also have extreme social anxiety, so just being stuck between hundreds of people made me constantly struggle to breathe and even walk. \n\nI did not really get bullied much thankfully, but there were always those people who would purposefully spook me and say weird things to get a response from me. \n\nI was always surrounded by many people, yet I dissociated so much that I felt completely isolated. Nothing felt real except that constant fear. All I wanted was to be able to face my fears and talk, but I could not no matter how hard I tried. Teachers did not care, and since I could talk at home, my family did not either despite witnessing my terrible random panic attacks that literally had me screaming uncontrollably. \n\nI am better now, mostly since I am not in school, but my path to getting better is still so long. I hope awareness spreads more so others dont have to live like that. eh, it was not the best. having SM made me an easy target cause i would just lock up due to how uncomfortable i was. a grew out of it somewhat since the transition from middle to high school i was mostly with the same classmates. worst part was dealing with substitutes. my teachers just assumed i was a quite kid and would only talk to friends while we worked but subs thought i was being rude for not answering them. Other teachers would laugh at past scenarios but i was lucky enough to be friendly with an english teacher in middle school who would later become my high school guidance counselor throughout my time there. she witnessed my lock ups and the awkward scenarios i would find myself in and slowly built up that trust through tutoring and later pushing me to make the best academic choices for myself. I honestly probably would not have gone to college if it was not for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; teachers can suck sometimes but try to find someone who will be in your corner Bullism and loliness. I did not finish high school  It was not be best. I was. I did not know. At the time, I did not even know selective mutism was a thing. My folks thought it was just me being shy. \n\nI still struggle from time to time, but I am doing much better now. It sucked. I had no friends in school, and I was afraid my family would find out something was wrong with me, so I kept my school struggles a secret from them. I could talk at home but not really in school. My family just thought I had no friends cuz I was too shy. I was once asked by a classmate if I talked to my parents.\n\n\nLunch time and recess were the worst cuz I stuck out like a sore thumb as the only kid with no friends. Group projects where they let people pick their own group members were also a source of humiliation for me. I dreaded those so much.\n\n\nI knew something was wrong with me but did not know what. It really killed me not knowing why I was like this. Did not find out about the term 'selective mutism' till I was like 19 (I saw it on the internet). I shamed myself for being broken for most of my life God, it was hell. I could always count the number of friends I had on one hand whether I was in high school or elementary school. Was bullied from day one, on and off, up until my final year of high school. I only found out what selective mutism was halfway through high school and knew it applied to me straight off the bat. Only mom knows since I was asking her what she thought about it, if it applied to me, etc.", "Do i have selective mutism? My mom told me i was in a coma for a month when i was near 1 years and she said after that i wasnt the same. She said i would be a mute and not talk at all. And im 1 year late in school because of it.(But then after some time i became kind of talkative at home of course). I should be a senior right now but im a junior because they thought i was autistic or something else. But being put with special ed school i was nothing like them so they put me back into regular. Through out school i would be mute and not speak at all. And sometimes of my life i would talk if i was comfortable. I remember i would be so talkative at times then switch back to mute and i dont know why i was like that. I really dont know why i was like that as a kid other than i was shy..? Now middle school i susprising made friends while i was a mute and i was in a friend group. All i did was shrug and nod and shake my head. Then i got to the point where i wrote on paper and show it to them to speak with them. Wtf. I had no problem typing and writing and stuff but speaking yes i had a problem with. Whyyyyy? At the start of high school i realized i was getting to confortable not talking and i knew that is not what i wanted to be. With family i was so talkative you wouldnt even notice i was shy. I knew i wasnt like this deep down so i started to talk in school. I started slow but talking more quietly and people were suprised because i would never talk. It feels like i just started a social journey or something because i would never talk. I actually feel like a person because im actually talking now and not just spectating. And i feel so good after talking to someone. I get that burst of energy after talking to someone. Of course im still kind of shy and awkward today but not as i used to be. I still dont know why i was still a mute because it does not feel like im the person to be a mute. My mom told me i wasnt the same and started being a mute after the 1 month coma i went through when i was 1 years old so i wondered if i have this or something else happened. The thing is i feel like ive overcame my and fear of talking. I looked up you cant grow out of this and i see people in the sub saying that they relapsed and stuff. I dont see myself relapsing though. Im kind of worried about that happening though because i wonder if i have this. I feel so stupid at my past self for being a mute all these years at school. Heres the thing i was talkative at home and willing to talk at places like stores and stuff. But when it was school or i met anyone from school i was a mute.", "i feel bad i do not talk much ( obviously ) and people do not talk to me ( i do not matter at school ) so me not talking does not usually bother me. i get lonely but i ignore the feeling. anyways, i feel bad because a girl in my art class just started talking to me out of nowhere. i pointed at her painting and gave it a thumbs up. she said thank you and went on about how she prefers drawing over painting and why and all that stuff. she was really nice but i just stood there frozen nodding my head and since we wear masks it is not like i could at least smile while nodding. someone spoke to me for once and i just froze. i texted her later on on snapchat and apologized and sure enough she was understanding. i just felt guilty i am probably going to be up late thinking about it tbh", "Is this selective mutism? So looking back I remember in school from preschool til 4th grade I do not talk at all at school. I literally do not say a word at all, when a teacher talk to me or if a classmate talk to me. Everyone just keep saying that I am shy or refer me to that girl that does not talk. But when I am home I am very chatty and my parents always say that I am very outgoing. But when in school I just shut down and do not say anything. \n\nIt was not until in 5th grade, one of my teacher got mad at me for not talking. She gave me a really long lecture forcing me to talk which I eventually did. After I talked my classmate want to talk to me and I eventually end up talking to them. I was saying one word at first and I do not even know how but I eventually was able to open up and become very social. I made some friends but I only talk to the people in my friend group and no one else besides that.\n\nSo fast forward in middle school and high school, I kind of lost all my friends and do not really talk again. But now I only talk when I am being spoken to other than that I do not talk or be able to show my personality. \n\nNow I am in college and I am having the same issue. I cannot make myself talk to my classmate or ask for help unless someone comes to me first. Even then I have a hard time trying to socialize. There are somethings I want to say in my head but It never comes out. So I was wondering is this selective mutism or did I used to have it then grown out of it and this is something else now? Hello, you appear to have asked a question about whether you have selective mutism. \n\nWe can help you understand selective mutism with ( Please remember that our members can only give you an opinion on whether you meet the criteria for selective mutism, not a diagnosis. If you would like to be properly assessed, it is highly recommended to see a medical professional. ( section of the wiki.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/selectivemutism) if you have any questions or concerns.* Yes it sounds like selective mutism, likely as part of social or generalized anxiety. It would probably help to see a professional, either a therapist or psychiatrist or both. Your school should have resources you can access fairly straightforwardly. If you worry you may not be able to talk to them then write down what you feel you need to say and either read it verbatim or just pass them the note. It is very difficult to overcome this sort of issue on your own, take advantage of the resources your college offers while you can. I feel like I would feel more comfortable and open seeing a psychiatrist online, but it will not be the resources from my school since they do not have one for online. Would seeing one online be any different than in person? Also how do they treat you for this? Is it through medication or therapy or both? A psychiatrist is not a therapist, they pretty much only do a general assessment and prescribe medication. Online would be unlikely to be very different than in person.\n\nYou would likely be recommended a generalized medication for anxiety, which would ideally help to alleviate the freezing symptoms that anxiety brings. In my experience medication is merely a tool that tones down certain intense reactions, allowing us to take more conscious &amp; active control of our thoughts &amp; behaviours.\n\nTherapy would likely be either talk-therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy or both. There are other forms of therapy but for anxiety those are generally where treatment starts. They will help to reframe your experience &amp; better understand what is happening in your mind, to be better aware of things that happen as they happen, leading to better self control &amp; less overall anxiety. It is likely that there are some sort of underlying feelings of shame or insecurity that come up and result in your experience of mutism, therapy would work to uncover &amp; address these feelings.", "Just a vent I constantly feel like I am faking selective mutism because I can talk with friends. But I still have trouble talking to people even with friends and I can never explain. I feel like maybe its just social anxiety and not selective mutism but I feel like I am faking both. But then everyone else cannot understand it and think my fears are irrational and are completely fine with talking.  Hey man, you can habe selective mutism even if you talk to friends, that is where the selective comes from. Do not think you have to justify yourself because you can talk to people close to you. Your mental health is not something you need to prove, it is more important if you are not comfortable to talk to people, then do not.  I have had Selective Mutism and I overcame it but I still have some social anxiety. There is no magic pill for anxiety. You just have to face the thing you are most afraid of. Even go out of your way to put yourself in a situation where you have to face what you are afraid of. \n\nI did not talk to anyone except immediate family members for the first 13 years of my life and I am 19 now and I have given public speeches, made friends, and gone on dates. If you choose to face and crush your fears every chance you get your quality of life will improve and you will be able to achieve anything! This I promise you. Good luck. ", "Does this look like selective mutism to y\u00b4all? Sometimes I can\u00b4t talk but it isn\u00b4t because I\u00b4m like anxious or anything?\n\nI want to speak but actually using my vocal chords seems super exhausting,also this just happens randomly ,it doesn\u00b4t matter if I\u00b4m at home, in School or somewhere else.When I try to talk I just Kind move my mouth and toung as if I am Talking but I don\u00b4t make a Sound.\n\nOn the other Hand I can\u00b4t get myself to speak if I\u00b4m in a quiet room with strangers and am also super uncomfortable if a friend was to speak to me in such a situation\n\nIs that selective mutism? I would say this probably is not SM if it was happening randomly. From what I understand, people with SM tend to have strict rules around when they can and cannot speak due to their social anxiety rather than it being spontaneous or unpredictable.\n\nI think another possibility is that you are experiencing anxiety that you are not correctly identifying. When I was younger I genuinely thought my SM had nothing to do with anxiety because I never learned how to identify anxiety. In these moments where you have difficulty speaking, try checking in with your body. Are you tense? Too aware of your heartbeat? Sweating? Throat feels tight?  Fidgety? Nauseous?\n\nMaybe try keeping track of these situations and how they make you feel in a notebook or on your phone and see if there are any patterns. You might notice something. Good luck! :) It is certainly possible, but SM does not happen randomly. As mentioned by quill, people with selective mutism have a consistent and predictable pattern, finding it impossible to speak to the same people in the same situations. Awesome advice Quill. I was in the same boat as a kid. I thought the psychiatrists were crazy saying I had anxiety. Now that I experience anxiety frequently, I know I just was not able to identify it then. Typically SM is very structured and consistent. So I would say it is possible, but based on what I have seen, not likely that it is SM? Not a psychiatrist by any means, though. If you think you have selective mutism go to your doctor. Even if you think it is nothing, please go to your doctor.

I always try pretend I am normal without it but I always come to a wall because the feelings from it are way too overwhelming.\n\nI am losing faith in myself having a future and I have no friends and no hope. What can I do to fix myself? It always amazes me how many older people have SM because they cannot seem to get help at an early age.\nIdk what to say. I went to a specialist when I was a kid. Idk why the people you are going to are just turning you away. That is terrible. You should probably try and find an SM specialist. hey! first, congrats on your completed degree! and you are so brave for already being looking for a job. I suggest that you look at available resources for adults with SM, in many places there can be acomodations done for you, even at the interview moment. which can help you a lot! its just a little extra step you might need to take in your journey to find a job. But you can do it ;) right now I dont have those resources at hand, but I will comment here later with links! or come PM and I will send it to you. I only figured out about my selective mutism at \\(M), currently (34). I struggled tremendously with job interviews for the same reason. I still do not have any good advice on that. Someone told me to say beforehand that i have a speech impediment before beginning the interview, and that helped the last time. In other words, i finally found someone to role play interviews who understood my difficulties. I had to keep fighting for myself and I think made it through.\n\nOn the therapy front, EMDR and trauma therapists worked for me because with EMDR, you do not have to speak for it to work and trauma therapists understand problems speaking.\n\ndirect advice:\n\nfind someone to role play interviews who understands speech impediments and who will not tell you to hide them in the interview process.\n\nlook for therapists who specialize in trauma.\n\nHope that helps and makes sense, i tend to create word salad and direct advice feels weird for me to write. It is too rare. Usually parents auto assume it is shyness and ignore it. Either that or getting help is too expensive or not possible due to location. I travelled 600km to a specialist lol.\nNah but idk I am sure you could get in contact with a specialist without physically visiting them nowadays. Idk how far it would get you but it is probably worth a shot. I could not even get a degree, i ended up quitting. Even then it is not that easy. I have had a few psychologists claim to be \u201cspecialists\u201d in SM, but they treated me like I was choosing to be mute, and always attempted to force me to speak. It is so hard to find a *good* specialist. Honestly I am tempted to become one myself in the future Me as well maybe give some good psychological therapy a go. There may be tools you can get from sessions. First of all, congrats on completing your degree!\n\nI understand you. I am 24 and in a similar situation. I went to college for 3 years to study, but I could barely say a word to anyone during that entire time, and since leaving I have just felt no choice but to shut myself away for countless years of my life.\n\nThere is little point in me trying to get a job knowing that I stand zero chance of success at an interview. The combination of SM, chronic anxiety and depression, and extremely low self-esteem would make that impossible for me. I sympathize because I know how hopeless SM can make you feel.\n\nI hope that we can both find a way to recover from this. One session of mock interviews from a good friend and years of trauma therapy helped me. \n\nI only became aware and started to work on my selective mutism around 30, currently 34. Finding someone who would do the mock interview was literally impossible because the mutism severely isolated me. Selective mutism is not a response to trauma. It is an anxiety disorder. Mutism related to a trauma is different and will need different treatment than SM. I only say this because it is important to have the right diagnosis to get the best treatment.  Trauma treatment and SM treatment are very different. I really relate to you. I(21F) am in college right now and I have felt really hopeless and depressed due to SM and have had trouble opening up to therapists. I got really discouraged  when I felt like I would never be able to get a job or keep a job and never be able to make friends. I also comes from a big family who often does not seem to understand how hard it is or how not normal I am due to SM. You have already come so far being able finish your degree and apply for jobs and showing up at interviews! You have made some progress! I know you can improve and eventually get a job and even make friends. If you want to pm me feel free. I am open to sharing my experiences and helping in anyway I can. You deserve to be happy Yes, my parents did not realize it was SM until I was in mysterious teens. There have been so many times I wished they had gotten the right help for me early on before it just became more difficult to change and SM became worse for me &gt;they tell me to come back when i can talk more\n\ns**t therapists In college I spent all my free time sitting on a bench looking out at the ocean. These days are different in that I spend all my free time sitting on a bench in the park.", "I need some guidance. Please \ud83d\ude4f I am a 21-year-old youth, just finished college and I am on a job hunt now. Since my childhood, I have been stuttering and due to the same, I started having social anxiety. I would abstain from speaking in social situations fearing that I would stutter and make fun of myself. I was around 8 years old when I realized that I was not 'normal'. Slowly my stuttering reduced as I grew up and I started having very easy conversations with my friends and family. But the fear that I would mess up a social situation was still there. I would easily express my thoughts to the people I was comfortable with. But in certain situations, even with my family, I cannot utter some words that I want to. So I utter a synonym that comes out of my mouth. This has been with me always. Never have I ever spoken what I really want to. Every time the conversation is distorted because of my inability to speak out in certain scenarios and with certain people. I have had encounters with people where I get stuck on a word and then just go blank and speak nothing. I cannot explain how weird the situation becomes. I do not even know what the other person thinks of me at that point in time. This adds to the anxiety and stays with me for weeks. I regret the social situation when I stood frozen. I get nightmares about it and can not get over it for months. Many times I find myself in the middle of something and then the memory of those situations makes me feel miserable for no reason. \n\nIn the current phase of my life, I am hunting for jobs. My first interview was a month ago. I knew all the answers that the interviewer asked me but due to the fear, I constantly kept changing words in order to be able to speak them out. But it happened again. I stuck in a word I wanted to say and I went blank. I looked at the panel and just froze. They looked surprised. They thought I was nervous which I was and tried to motivate me. Nothing worked. I just wanted out. I still tried answering the next question. I knew the answer by heart but again was not able to express it. They were fed up by my inability to speak up and asked me to leave.\n\nIt is been a month now and I have not appeared for any other interviews. I do not know what to do. I am from Nepal. My people do not care about mental health. I cannot tell my parents or friends about it. I want to help myself. Is this Selective Mutism? When I looked online, this condition was closest to mine. I cannot afford therapy. First of all, best wishes to you - please be aware that sooner or latter you will be able to overcome this. It is just the matter of understanding your condition and finding the method that can work for you.\n\nNow, onto your question - I am\nBy no means an expert, I am just a parent helping my daughter who has SM. My experience with her has been, I would say  based on your description, a bit more severe and different from your in some points. She would be completely mute and almost unable to use body language, as if she was made of stone. She would undergo a transformation on our way to daycare, she would be singing and talking loudly in her normal cheerful and cheeky way until we neared the daycare, and then she apple progressively lower until her voice was gone by the time we reached the door. She would behave like a different child. She was compliant with everything without resistance, as to avoid the argument that she would not be able to carry out. Her voice was not heard, not even for laughing or crying, for five solid months at full time regimen. \n\nShe has been professionally diagnosed with SM after thorough examination in different setting over a course of several weeks. \n\nNow, what you describe may have some overlapping features with what I have seen from my daughter, as in blanking out, and the general insecurity with new people in a new environment. However there are also notable differences, as in you are able to vocalise, even though in an altered vocabulary, prior to blanking out. \n\nDo you have trouble initiating conversation everyday? For example, asking a vendor about something you are looking for? Or asking a stranger what time is it? Does your voice simply stop coming out, when your thinking is still sharp? From what I have heard from adult SM (on YouTube), they can think, rationalise, form thoughts, recall all words related to the situation going on, they can still function, but are completely unable to utter a sound. \n\nIf you are unsure, maybe put yourself to the test - go out there and test your vocal expression ability in small, everyday activities, that do not require any ingenious formulation of speech, just something quite ordinary. SM people tend to have trouble with this, and not be able to speak, or manage to fluster only, Ina low and insecure tone, but not necessarily, or not usually stuttering.\n\nIf you can handle it, that is really good, that is more than many SM are able to do at the moment, and then you have still your situation to deal it, but while somewhat impairing in more challenging situations, it would not be as dramatic as SM, thankfully!\n\nI wish you every bit of success in your journey! I agree, as someone who has SM, although I see some similarities, overall it seems quite different from SM. People with SM get anxieties before they even try to speak, not during their speaking.  It definitely sounds like a social anxiety though. Thank you so much for your concern. You taking the time to respond to my question means a lot. \n\nDo I have trouble initiating conversations? YES! That is totally me. In some days, I will normally have a conversation with the vendor and ask him all sorts of questions. But again in some days, I will know what to say but the words will not come out at all. This happens generally when I start thinking about what I have to say. Then I go up to that person, the moment he/she looks up into my eyes, I go blank. Not completely blank. I still know what I am supposed to say but I just will not know how to speak. This sounds too weird I know. I have trouble asking the bus conductors to make a stop at my destination. I usually start thinking about how to say it loud and then everything freezes when I grab his attention to speak. I just will not say a word. \n\nI have been suicidal a lot of times in my early teenage just because of my inability to speak in certain situations. But now I know life is a gift and cannot really take it out and die with my dreams. I want to overcome my anxiety and get my life on track. I do have extreme anxiety running through me when I try to utter a word. It just fears me out. I will generally stumble upon the first word and then just cannot say a thing. In other scenarios, I would say that and more easily. I am so sorry that I cannot help you further. \n\nAs I said I am by no means a specialist (and as soon as you get the chance you should look for one), so I really do not know if what you have is actually SM or if it could be more on the anxiety spectrum.\n\nAll I can say is that the behaviour therapy that seems to work with SM does not take going to therapy and trying to speak to a therapist. Instead it has to do with practical speaking tasks in everyday situations, carried out with the help of someone you already speak too comfortably. A SM child is usually helped by her parents. \n\nI think it is quite possible that a SM person has better and worse days. It is difficult for me to imagine though, based on the little experience I have, that they could speak to strangers in a job interview, at first try. What I observe with my daughter is that her difficulty is to give that leap of faith and start speaking. Once she starts, she will not stop. But everyone is different and that is what makes it so difficult to understand your condition without the professional experience. I really wish I could help you more, and wish you all the best in overcoming this challenge.", "Want To know something that grinds my gears? The \u201cquiet kid\u201d memes/jokes. I HATE THEM  omg sameee i see them on tiktok all the time. like just cause i am quiet does not mean i am going to shoot up a school, those things do not even really correlate. i would not hurt anyone but myself God I forgot the post but on r/publicfreakout there was a post about some girl shouting at the quiet kid and the teacher says something stupid like \"Hey stop that, he will probably shoot up the school\"", "??? hi, i am 20 in may &amp; i just thought i would try to explain the way i am about certain things &amp; idk i would rather go on reddit before a doctor just you know to hear what anyone has to say about what im saying about me. \ni was diagnosed with selective mutism &amp; depression when i was 10, before that doctors would say its the flu as i puked from anxiety. when i was prob 8/9 well idk when i started but ik i would put music in headphones &amp; go on my trampoline &amp; walk in circles &amp; just imagine a completely different life &amp; the storyline has changed many times considering my age now but i still do it just in my hallway at home. i get like an urge to do it like an addiction or something idk i have never heard anyone say anything like this before i could be the only person who is ever done this. i have the absolute hardest time making friends (i love the few i have tho) in school no one would ever talk to me &amp; i could never talk to someone first so the only way i ever made friends was online, then meeting in person (or just online) when i was 16/17 im guessing (that is when guys mostly started hitting me up) then i found that i would get told im too awkward then get unadded/blocked the literal only guy who didnt immediately after meeting me was my ex but he broke up with me after almost 3 months bc he didnt know if i wanted to have sex &amp; i think bc of my anxiety &amp; that was almost 2 years ago i basically refuse to meet anyone new bc im not trying to just get dropped &amp; i cant really defend myself &amp; yes/no are extremely impossible in person i can only say idk except with my immediate family &amp; my few close friends. another thing is that i absolutely have no clue how to know my mood i used to always say good then i got hit by a truck in nov 2018 &amp; then i knew i had to be bad bc of the pain but i have no clue what good is supposed to feel like at all really. i also do things like eye contact lowkey feels like it hurts my eyes in a way but i just associated that with my anxiety. for some reason all i can ever talk about is animals, when someone in my family seems annoyed or like they do not care i tell myself i am never talking to them again &amp; the next time i talk its about animals. i cant get a job no matter how hard i try since i was 15/16, i had one last summer on a blueberry farm but it was too much standing after breaking my femur i would have been able to do it if my leg was not an issue too, but idk i just thought id explain some stuff cuz it makes me confused &amp; upset I relate to this a lot, I really do. I daydream for about 10 hours a day and the rest is practically panic attacks and feeling horrible because I cannot talk and sometimes I do not even want to talk. I am also really awkward and I have practically no friends and those I had just used me because I have no idea on how to say no and stand by my boundaries. I was diagnosed with selective mutism and autism and a lot of other stuff but that is the two things I think fit the most and explain me relating. But I am not a doctor and ai would really recommend talking to a therapist or psychiatrist! I am sorry for this novel, but you are not alone with this, I promise. hi! i relate to a ton of this. starting in middle school (and into high school and still occasionally now - i just graduated college lol) i created a whole fake world i would live in with many characters and complex storylines and like obviously i knew it was fake the whole time but i guess it was sort of my escape bc like you, i also struggled socially and still do. i am the same way where people dont approach me and i cant talk first so i have only been successful making friends online (the veryyy few friends i have i met online first) and even with them, i barely speak in person and just feel so awkward\n\nalso a lot of what you described sounds similar to autism and i am definitely not trying to diagnose you at all but if you wanted, you could  research autism traits and see if they seem to match up with your experiences and feelings! i would also suggest looking specifically at autism in  because it can often present itself differently in different genders\n\nand if you ever want to just talk about anything feel free to message me! sometimes it feels nice to just talk to others who can relate with you about certain things", "I do not know what to do \nIt is my boyfriend\u2019s birthday today and he wants to voice chat, we have voice chatted a couple of times tho when he asked to voice chat my throat just got dry and tight, I told him that it is be embarrassing ( tho it was a lie I just idk when I try to open my mouth to speak these past few day nothing comes out and I feel horrible for lying) he said it might be but it is fine tho but he said if I did not feel comfortable it is ok ( he is aware of my mutism), but at the same time it is his birthdays and I want to do anything to make him happy but I just cannot talk idk why I am stupid, I told him I would think hard but i know the answer is still no, but I do not know what to tell him, last time I spoke against my will I stoped speaking for 5 month and I am scared that will happen again. Idk what to do or tell him someone help? Please Maybe you can do text if you are better with that, and he can do voice. I do not think you are stupid, you are mutism's just worse today. I hope the rest of the day goes well for both of you Can you record yourself in a video? I often did that for my husband when we were dating. It was somehow easier for me because I was alone.\n\nEdit to add: If not a video maybe just a voice recording? My recommendation is just like the others. Maybe pre-record yourself saying something short and sweet. Then, in the video/voice chat let him talk and you just text. If you decide to say something you obviously can and he would love it, but if not you can always play the recording for him at the beginning or end of the call. \n\nOverall, take a deep breath and a moment to relax. He knows you and wants you to be comfortable first and foremost. Do not worry about him wanting to talk with you because that is secondary. What he really cares about is you, how happy you are, and spending time with you. You are allowed to relax and enjoy being loved (even if you have not said it yet, his actions/words show he cares). Allowing yourself a moment of space to destress will help you both in the end. Self-care is important, and it helps those who care for you as well as making you feel better. Often times I have a hard time doing things for myself, but knowing someone I love will be happier if I feel better makes it easier to go through the motions of self-care. Good luck!", "Looking for some help Hello. I am looking for some feedback, information, resources, etc., to help my young daughter who has selective mutism. While that was the diagnosis she received, I believe this has turned more into progressive mutism. I have done extensive research over the past few weeks about SM, and I have tried to find some help for us, but there truly is not much out there about progressive mutism. Any thoughts, info., treatment experience, etc. would be very much appreciated. Thanks! have you taken a look at our resource library? \n\nProgressive mutism is treated in the same way as selective mutism, so I would just look for resources on that.", "What was that initial day like when you decided to shoot for recovery? (again a question for those recovered or who started recovery more seriously) Also a rant for those not truly considering recovery. I hate to keep being the only one posting, but I have to keep at it. I need all the insight I can get, and I just keep thinking. I literally just read the whole Wikipedia page on 'Selective Mutism.'\n\nI have another question again for those who recovered, **How did you start, and how fast/severely did you tackle, battling SM? What was that initial 'f\\*\\*k it' day like, how much progress was made?**\n\n*RANT:*\n\nHonestly I think tomorrow I really want to make a big impact on it and just try to talk the most I have in a long time to my family. Will that happen, idk? A lot changes from the night to the morning. If anything significant does happen, I will update the post. I hope to be the guy here that can help those who are not recovered. To me, this is all 'normal,' and it always has been...but at the same time I cannot live as normal as others and it bugs me so much, it is so stupid how I cannot even talk to my family. It just sounds so dumb. Though I guess that is what this is. It is really that aspect that drives me the most.\n\nAlso it is not that I am not comfortable now, it is just that I am missing out in so many ways. I really urge everyone here to think and consider recovery truly. If you caught me a month ago, there was no real care for recovery in my mind...although I knew eventually this would all catch up to me regardless. I just pushed this recovery all off because I thought I did not care, and in ways I do not but in others I do.\n\nI actually have a cousin who idk if he was/is SM, but in conversation he is not that assertive, he will lack the social skills most have, and he was always deemed the 'one that does not talk' by relatives. He is 30+ and I feel bad, he is still with his parents and without a job. He is on disability for a supposed 'back injury' from carrying books in HS...he went to college online, and I am not doubting he could be genuinely injured, though I cannot help but think maybe it is just a 'push-away excuse?' And I know this may come off as a jab or insensitive, but to me this is all a serious topic and I will just share that whole-ly, rather than as a half-truth to avoid that. I wonder if he is unhappy or not? I would not be happy if I was him; not genuinely...I am not happy with my current life at 18, not whole-heartedly...and when I am happy, I will tell you I am literally on top of the world. Also as far as I am aware, he is never had a significant other too. He really just has his dogs, along with his parents. \n\nI have to be honest with myself, that is not where I would want to end up. I mean this is all not an easy thing to overcome, but where does the vision of your life end up? (That vision being nothing off the table, pretend you are the most outgoing and confident person in the world with your goals). And I say this to just see if you do want to recover or not, because I will see a lot of sugar-coating on this sub in instances and to me I feel like it is not always the way to go. \n\nThanks for the help, this sub has helped. Again I will update if I do anything drastic tomorrow. I am pretty active here after all. I hope it goes well for u man! I am in a similar spot as you because I am 17 and terrified for my future. I have had zero jobs, zero relationships, and like 1 week of volunteer experience. I have always realized that at some point I need to recover to be successful in life, but it seemed impossible because this is all I have ever known. However, school has remained closed since March of 2020, and jt has made me realize what life will be like once I graduate. I have not talked to anyone outside my family since the covid outbreak. Now I want to force myself to talk and make friends as soon as school resumes next month. Hope things work out for the both of us. I hope so too, I think college will be good for me. Even if at first I am quiet (although that is where I can talk, I am still nervous). Hopefully there I develop skills to just communicate better and translate to my home life. \n\nAs much as I want to speak, the change of it is really what is scary for me. I just have to keep that mindset, that it is my family, I can talk to them. I should. Hopefully we are both with the recovered flair in not too long, here.", "Is it bad for me to get homeschooling? School is literal hell for me. I had a mental breakdown this morning and ended up not going. I cannot deal with it. I really do not want to go tomorrow I cannot stop crying. I have no friends there and everything is depressing and stressful. I want to start homeschool ASAP but my dad does not want me to isolate myself more. Well therapy, medication, and actually being in school has not helped me so I do not see why not. There is a concept in abuse called no contact. It means to leave the house the abusive parent or partner resides in and to refuse to answer calls or texts. You go on a detox. Most people rave about the effects it has on their overall mental health.\n\nIf school's a triggering environment for you, it might be good in theory to take a break but something else that can happen is that if your SM also makes it hard to leave the house for fun or errands, leaving school can essentially trap you inside the house and it is then a real risk to your mental health as well. \n\nIs the staff in your school doing all of this ( ? If not you can try to get your parents to have conversations with your school staff so they are more knowledgeable about the things that make the environment easier for you to handle. For me, I was never diagnosed with SM and it was only in hindsight, when I was already able to speak in most situations that I even acknowledged that it was ever a problem. Because my family's abusive they pretend it never happened and is not currently an issue with other young members of my family. I found that just watching the video above and realizing the lengths other parents go through to get their children help made it real for me. For me, one major step I wish I would taken sooner was to accept being mute for the present. \"Meeting\" other people with selective mutism might help with that. There are tons of people talking about their SM on YouTube. It takes a long time to slowly get comfortable with speaking in new situations and you are going to be a selective mute for at least the next couple of months if not years. For me, there are days now when I take comfort in not speaking and try to stop and tell myself there is nothing wrong with silence, with not communicating verbally or being quiet or alone somewhere. I do not struggle with speech anymore but still struggle with the painful memories of how embarrassed and vulnerable I felt being unable to talk, how I was blamed for not talking. I was once told  that my lack of participation \"was not going to fly\" in one teacher's classroom, which makes it seem like she not only thought my quietness was inappropriate, she thought it was malicious somehow. \n\nI like to think of it accepting your SM as just taking on a point of view. Do you have a disability or are you controlling? Are you unable to talk or just quiet? You have to define where you are for yourself and accept it no matter how long you have struggled with it. I think that makes it easier to then take the steps to figure out where to go next. I think in general it is better to focus on the things you want for yourself and the skills you need to be able to get them than to look at it from the perspective of getting rid of an undesirable part of you. If you keep your eye on general self care you might be more motivated to go out and get fresh air or be responsible with daily tasks and find yourself incidentally being around people more and feeling like a normal person who actually does speak sometimes. ", "I have trouble concentrating in school where my SM effects me. Is anyone else like this? ", "Anyone else with SM sick of people asking you why you are so quiet? How do you respond to a question like that? \"Well, I am glad you asked. You see, I have an anixety disorder called \"Selective Mustism\" that makes it very difficult for me to talk to people. I only talk to people that I am completlety comfortable around, like my parents and freinds\" it would probably go something like that if I told them the truth. But seresiouley, whenever they ask me that it leaves me dumbfounded. It is like asking someone why they have brown hair. I usually shrug or say something like \"because I do not have much to say\" which is the exact opposite of the truth, but I do not have the time or enenrgy to tell them I have Selective Mutism. Look, if you want someone really quiet to talk more and come out of their shell, be respectful about it. Do not ask them dumb questions like why are you so quiet. Tell them they should talk more or something. Urge them to talk more and make them comfrtable in your precense but do not go around poking in their buissness. That wants to get me talking a lot more then asking me why I am so quiet. Can anyone relate to this? Yes same thing happens to me seems funny they would ask someone who does not talk why they do not talk and expect an answer. The few friends I have ever made never asked me that question. It is tough when you actually decide to try talking to someone and the first thing they ask is why I do not talk. Yeah it happens to me all the time. I am not selectively mute, I just do not like talking to people in public most of the time but I speak fine. \n\nI am still not much of a speaker around new people so whenever it does happen I just tell them I prefer to observe and think rather than comment on everything that happens. But again, I am not selectively mute so this could mean nothing in which case I apologize. \n\nIt is funny how asking someone \u201cwhy do you talk so much?\u201d comes across far more rude than the former I am sick of it mostly because I cannot speak to answer the question \ud83d\ude1e It actually does not bother me that much. My response depends on who is asking and the context. I either shrug, say I am not good at talking to people, or give the real answer. It does get annoying when people ask if I took a vow of silence or something though. I hate it so much and I agree, what on earth are you supposed to say? I do not have SM anymore but I am still quiet/shy and this question always throws me off. I can think I am doing so well but others do not see it that way. It is even worse when they ask \"why is your face getting red?\" Like thanks a lot, it is because I am feeling embarrassed and you pointing it out does not help! Especially \u201cyou are so quiet\u201d they just keep repeating that, like I am aware I heard you the first time It used to not bother me either, but after awhile, it is just not something you should say to someone. It is disrespectful and your basically saying that their personallity is a negative thing. Part of what made me change my view was when I was thinking of ways people have disregarded me. Why are YOU so loud? Not usually, my friends always correct them. No one every asks me this, but I would be very glad if someone did so I could explain to someone...", "Adult with Selective Mutism.

I have had it since around that time, I started to talk a lil in school, because if I did not I became known as the kid who did not talk and people would just wait for me to talk.

I have done some research into it, and it pains me to think about what all of you and she has to go through. \n\nI am reaching out here to see if anyone has general advice - I know individuals are different - to form a closer connection with her. A lot of times, saying the things she needs/wants to someone is impossible. Is there things that made you more comfortable talking to someone or just being around them? I really appreciate all of you! Try to text her? I could not talk to others, but learned how to communicate through chat rooms. Okay! I did text her today:) she liked the message not too long ago but has not responded yet. Thank you!! Give plenty of time for responses and such. I would say 20-40 seconds+. If she is better with any form of communication (i.e. pointing and writing) try to make things work with that. I am not a professional, but this helps me, and several others.\n\nWith me there are some backdoor ways to get to something. I can almost always answer yes/no questions, she may not like this approach even if she has something like this though. One little piece of advice: be patient. I remember when I first met some of my friends, they would ask me every day if I wanted to hang out with them. Even though I kept saying no, I really appreciated that they would want to include me at all. Eventually, I said yes and we would hang out at lunch. Just know that even if she does not respond, I am sure she appreciated them. Do not give up on her. \ud83d\udc96 She is an amazing writer. I will definitely take that into consideration, thank you\ud83d\ude0a Just spend time with her? You dont have to talk. Read alone together. Go for a drive. Go for a walk. Watch A movie and let her pick. She is my step sister so she is at her moms most of the time but I did not think about that! It is a good idea, thank you\ud83d\ude0a I would say just like the others commented, spend time with her, do something fun! Just treat her normally, like any other sister (of course with adjustments to SM), but do not act as if SM is not out of the norm, or act super surprised when she does give some response, or starts getting more comfortable! I hope that makes sense hehe I agree with this the most. Do not treat her like she has SM. Talk to her normally but maybe give yes/no options so she can nod. If she happens to talk, just respond to what she said, do not make a big deal out of it. This is so kind of you! \n\nI work with a girl with SM, and I have found that a good way to communicate is to ask a question where she would not need to speak to answer. For instance, if I want her to choose between chocolate or vanilla ice cream, I would pull both out and ask her which one so that she can point to them. For going to the movies, I would bring up the movies on the computer screen and let her point. We communicate a lot with her just tapping me on the arm and pointing at something, like if she needs help with a craft we are doing together, she will tap me and point to the part she is having trouble with.", "A story So I have never told anyone about this, which happened to me about 7 or 8 years ago. This event has caused me so much pain and think about it constantly. \n\nBackstory: I (18F) am not diagnosed with selective mutism but I am currently working on it with my therapist. I have struggled with speaking in certain situations all my life, these usually include speaking to teachers, people I am not close with, etc. I never received any sort of support or help for this until I was about 15/16 when I managed to pluck up the courage to tell my mum I think I needed help. Even then I still had very little support. \n\nStory: I was about 11 years old and I was at school. We had a substitute teacher that day but I knew her, she was my old friends (who was also in this class) mum so she knew me too. We had just finished doing some simple maths equations and we were sitting down on the mat. The teacher was asking random people from the class the answers to the questions. Speaking in front of the class (especially when put on the spot like this) is something I have never been able to do. But of course the teacher picked on me. Now I had been at school for 7 years at this point so I had been picked on many times before. Usually I try my very hardest to say the answer (which I almost always know) but 99.99% of the time it never comes out and after not long teachers usually will move on. \n\nUnfortunately this teacher decided that she was not going to move on. She kept pushing me to say the answer (which was 36 - its been so engrained into my head and I do not think I will ever forget it). She was not blind, so I am sure she could see the pain on my face. Eventually the tears arrived. In situations like this I tend to freeze. I was completely still, not making eye contact and in so much pain. She eventually gave up on getting the answer but did not let me off the hook. (Keep in mind that the entire class is watching this). She made some comment about how I was being very disrespectful, rude, etc. and then told me to go wait outside in the hallway.\n\nI am not really sure how I managed to move during this given hat I am was completely frozen, but I did,  I got up and went out into the hallway, went to a corner and continued to cry. I am not really sure what I was crying about - was it that I was upset with the teacher? myself? or the situation? I do not know. \n\nThe teacher finished the questions with the rest of the class. While she was doing so, a family friend (who I am not close with but just know) who was in the year above (not in my class) me saw my crying in the hallway and asked what was wrong, of course I could not tell her what happened so she opened the door to my class and told the teacher that I was out here. The teacher told her to just leave me and she would sort me out once she is finished.\n\nWhen the teacher eventually came out she basically yelled at me again and lectured me about how rude and disrespectful I am. I honestly do not know why. She knew me. She knew I basically could not talk in that situation, but she just did not get it. She let me back into the class but I just did not want to be there. It was really embarrassing. I mean its embarrassing enough not being able to speak when picked on, but when the teacher basically full on humiliates me in front of the class... its hard. It was really awkward with my friends afterwards as well and I was not that close with them which made it harder. \n\nI always think about that day. What could I have done differently to not have ended up in that situation? What if I did not just go out into the hallway? - the door to outside was right there, I could have gone anywhere. I tend to go to the bathrooms when I feel overwhelmed, so what if I had gone there? No one would no where I was. I would have made the situation worse but would it have been better in the long run? Surely if they could not find me then they would have had to call my parents or someone, therefore other people would know what happened that day. But no one knows (or at least I do not think anyone knows, if some else knows they never brought it up with me). \n\nMaybe the teacher thought she would push me into speaking when picked on. If that was her plan then it definitely did not work. I still cannot speak in those sorts of situations, it could even be worse now. All through high school teachers continued to tell me (but a lot more gently and not in front of the class) that its rude not to answer when spoken to, and so on. \n\nSorry for the long post, but it does feel nice to write this out rather than keeping it all in my head. Thanks for listening :) *whom* I am not close with Its cause of stories like this that we need to raise awareness for sm \ud83d\ude14 it sucks, and has proven even worse being forced to work in retail and getting customers confronting your manager because you do not talk. Well, I would get a job in a field that was practical if there were jobs out there, but these days you take what is available! They have a go at you for being unemployed then have a go at you for not being like everybody else you work with, they think just because you do not talk it is an attitude problem and that you probably just do not want to work, or be there at all, then they go and tell your job network this \"She just did not want to b e there at all\" that was not it at all! if employers were not so narrowminded and arrogant and actually confronted you, asking if you have any health issues etc. but not it is all about them, and if an employee is not acting like a robot then it must mean they are arrogant and just do not want to work at all. Ugh! It is a no win situation, the workforce is really destroying my ability to continue liking humans, and I battle a constant battle of even wanting to be on this earth because of the lack of awareness for Selective Mutism and other disabilities. Looking back at my time in Primary School and High School there are many stories of humiliation. Once a teacher send me outside the building to yell the answer up to the classroom. This day she was angry because some pupils answered her questions with soft voices so she hardly heard them. She warned us that if someone isn\u2018t answering loud enough the pupil will be send outside on the street to yell the answer from the street. She went on to question the class and all of a sudden it was my turn. I was surprised and of course my answer did not come out as loud as it should have. The teacher asked someone in the last row if they were able to hear my answer and they said no. She sent me outside on the street and there I was, yelling the answer up to the window. Amusement to the people walking by and the rest of the school.\nLooking back I think it would have been better to go outside and walk home.\n\nIt hurts. It hurts terrible. I would love to tell you that you will get over it. The point is I am 46 and all the stories are with me like shadows. But maybe it is not about getting over something but more about to live with something. We are still here with all the memories and bruises. We find our ways in life. We can help with our stories so the others can understand. It is crazy how many adults took my not talking as a personal attack on them growing up.\n\nAbout a year ago, I found a picture of me from when I was like nine. I was smiling really big and holding a cat. I was so cute. Idk why but my mind immediately went to how people treated me when I was that she and I started to cry. I cannot imagine treating that girl the way people treated me.\n\nSome people just really lack the social and emotional skills to interact with people with SM. I hope as more awareness is brought to the disorder, people become for empathetic. I am sorry you had to go through that. I hope you heal \ud83d\udda4 Thanks for sharing your story it reminded me of similar situations I have been it. I have been told so many times that I am rude, and usually I am just trying to chill and get through my day. It does hurt though so I can relate to that, it is hard being in a position where you so badly want to say that you are not being rude you just are not able to get your words out. I have struggled with it a lot, I still do, but I usually get to a point right now where I do speak up this has been through years, and years of people treating me badly because of it. I am still unusually quiet for everyone, I just do not let anyone walk all over me I  hope you find a way to deal with it as well. I am so sorry this has happened to you. As an adult, your teacher should have known better than to try bullying you into talking. \n\nI understand that this experience is still very much alive within you and bugs you, is that correct? I would advise to practice offering compassion to your inner child. You did the best you could with the tools that you had and you were just a kid. The teacher is the one who should have known how to address the situation better. Thank you for sharing your experiences here. Everyone here understands your pain!", "My Selective Mutism definitely leans more towards Progressive then I care to admit. I also feel like I will never recover. I wish I did not have to be vague here, but I do not want to openly write/admit what occurred out there on the internet (although it will more than likely never be matched)....nothing that serious, but enough that it is smart to be vague with it.\n\nBut this situation is one where any normal person would be readily speaking; basically out of obligation. Though thanks for the 5th Amendment that is not too much of a real legal issue. I am just lucky the right people were there and the situation was calm overall. Though, I realized then and there...that I feel so little in social situations, I feel like a kid (I am 18). I like to say I can talk to strangers (I cannot talk to my Family) and I can, but it does not mean I still cannot shutdown or panic internally over it. And I thought maybe I wanted to be something similar (as a job)...someday, but now I do not think I ever want to be that, it is just so socially draining. And I have come to the conclusion that I despise social situations, greatly; especially one's so stressful.\n\nAs much as THIS life of Selective Mutism is so normal to me, the world out there is equally abnormal and fucking terrifying. I want someone to love and someone to love me, but at the same time I want everyone to stay away and never come near me again....and as much as I want these \"normal people\" things, at times (and that time is now), I equally do not want anything to do with them. It is just too much. I just want to be left to my lonesome forever. I wish I was immortal so I could have all the time in the world to get past this. Even if I was able to talk tomorrow, I have NEVER felt like a 'normal person,' I have always felt, I think different from these people. It is hard to believe I could just fit right in with everyone else.\n\nI know with the right motivation, there is the will to push myself to recover (I was once there)...and I hear people who have recovered, all the time saying how you start to realize it is a false sense of security....though at the same time, it is so hard to picture that end ever happening. I do not really picture my life too far into the future, I am honestly fearful that eventually I may kill myself. I have never made an attempt of such, and the worst I have done with self-harm, is slapped myself (not too hard) within the last few weeks (it made me feel a little better), or hit my hands together hard (when specifically mad at a game, and that just hurt)...that was a while ago, like 2 years ago.\n\nI know eventually I can get past this bad mindset as I have before, but I think my bad mindset now, is rooted in this disease. I just never really came to gripes with it before, so deep. It is also not that I want to give up the opportunity that life is, but I am just afraid I will get that low, and can never picture that opportunity being for me, but just for everyone else. I do not feel like anyone else, even here, I feel less normal than each of you. It seems like you have everything more together, and I do not.\n\nI am 18 but I have not had any responsibility in my life. I am afraid to be seen as someone who takes their own responsibility. I have cooked this pizza roll, 2 times in the past...but I always did it when no one else was awake or around. This morning my brother wakes up while I am trying to do it for the 3rd...and he asks around to my sister, if she was cooking it...she was not. In time he left for 7-Eleven, and I just put the pizza roll back in the freezer and just went back to bed. Felt like shit.\n\nThe only motivation I carry in my life now, is that to go on Reddit, Wizard101, or Minecraft. Though sometimes I see the worth in none of them, and I just lay on the couch. I will go to bed at 6pm and wake up at 1am. I actually went to bed at 8pm (last night), and woke up late 11pm (the same day)...and just stayed up until, I went back to bed after feeling defeated with that Pizza Roll.....and some days I will stay up to 6am like it is nothing...and wake up in the early PMs.\n\nI had hated the doubtful side of those with SM back in July (when I was motivated), now I cannot help but to be on that same side. I do not have hope, my only hope is that maybe eventually I will have hope once again. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

It is hard to break that perception. I thought people with select mutism could not talk to strangers I think most can with family over strangers. From here though I have heard it is usually easiest to talk with those who have no expectation of you, and that is what strangers are to me. It is not that I will peek conversation or say more than necessary but when it comes to being able to talk, that is when it is the easiest for me (anywhere).\n\nSelective Mutism really has no bounds on who you can/cannot talk to, it is just generally family is the easy one for most (for me I have no one besides maybe Xbox parties, but even then I do not start convos often, my friends are the most developed area, where I communicate). I think the stigma people tend to develop of you (having SM) can be harmful to your ability to talk, in line with the stresses you already have with SM, now you have expectations of how you normally 'should' act too.\n\nIn college I was enrolled for a year, I talked and even made a video project for the teacher, then my Mom made them aware of my SM and I stopped communicating with them from that point on. Now I am in a new school, and my Mom tried to pull the same thing, I told her NOT to! It is the reason I cannot talk in school, they need to stop protecting me. And she put me in a class with my brother, which is ridiculous because now I cannot talk in that class. I will probably want to transfer to another school after this year/semester so I can start fresh again...and it has not even started yet. As much as my Mom may want to help, or such, she has little clue how to do it. Their help does more harm than good. Let me recover in the ways that I do, do not make me a science project in the meantime, I am not your test subject.\n\nI would think strangers are the easiest for most people though I am not sure (besides family), sure you have classmates you can not communicate with, but with them the stigma had time to develop...with strangers there are no expectations of how you should or should not act. If you fail, there is always a new stranger to try with.\n\nEdit: It is like you have the chance to be another you, if you are brave enough to take the chance. And when I say I am able to communicate with strangers, that is ONLY out of the presence of those I can not talk to or know me as SM. This was a very relatable and good read. Especially the part where you want to experience life, experience love, etc, but at the same time\u2026 you do not. And would rather just be left alone in silence. It is so tough to explain this to anyone else. It is also very sad being in this position. But I agree, much like you, I do not think I will ever change.. Yeah I do not think I have written something more open yet about my SM, I want everything, but I want to stay exactly the same and have everything. It does not make sense and I know that, but it is just exactly how I feel.\n\nToday I went to the drag strip with my Dad, and I had about 4 people separately approach me and I said a few words to each, but I did not like it (and if I am honest I hated it). Only 1 of the 4 times did the other person really hear me, another they heard what I initially said, but not my next phrase (yes), so I just nodded. My Dad I figured was telling them before they got to me that I do not speak really, so there was that. Which at the same time I do not want him to say that, idk...I do.\n\nAnd actually on the way home, at a light since the Car now has numbers on all 4 sides, a car stopped at the light next to me....and be known, I have Juice WRLD \"Bandit\" Blasting, since it is raining and night (that is when I am most comfortable to do that).....I wish I had another less basic song playing but it was what it was, the guy in the passenger seat (of this Ram pickup) asked if I was racing the car, so I muted my radio....and I tried to say \"once\" kind of loud, but ofc they did not hear me and it is just very awkward.\nIn time I just pull away fast, and that was that. I was just reflecting on that when we went to stop for gas after...thinking how if you gave me that scenario to do over, like a million times eventually it would be Ludacris how good I would feel about it. Though I was not too upset because I realized that there are a lot of social opportunities thrown at you if you are in the right place. Though I think my goal of 19 is a little too optimistic (only a little over 2 months away)....I just do not have that kind of motive.\n\nAnd today, in the morning I go to speech (idk, it is something I guess...my Mom thinks it helps, and in a way I guess it does)...but the motivation factor affects that as well, but anyway. The Speech teacher is probably the most chill person I socialize with in that sense, and it reminds me of my Sister's friends from 2012ish an I just loved that time and I miss it a lot.\n\nEdit: And if you are wondering about how the Drag Strip went for my car, I was just spinning tires the entire way down the track because I have no experience, so it was anti-climatic, but we are going back tomorrow morning. It is crazy, I am sure everyone overlooks us SM since we do not talk much. It is like we are easy to ignore for them. Like what happened with you at the drag strip, but then I read all of that and already I feel like I know so much about you and how you are pretty interesting / seem fun to talk to. \n\nI am glad you are enjoying your speech teacher, I would have to agree, my speech teacher was one of the most chill and down to earth people I have ever met. They specialize in communications so I guess it makes sense.\n\nAnyways, I hope all goes well with you. Just wanted to let you know that you seem like a really cool dude! Keep doing you Everyone else in conversation flows better than we do, so it feels like you fail before you even try.\n\nI wish my mind could almost be open to others because then it would all be easier, and yeah my Speech teacher just seems to know how to keep conversation going, even if I am not really talking as much back. It reminds me of two friends I used to have, they just knew what to talk about, and I could not even imagine being able to manage that skill. \n\nAnd thank you, I wish there was a better way we could all understand each other. Hey! I have SM and I am 18 from Canada, and I was diagnosed with it when I was 14. I also have autism and other conditions.\n\nI would love to talk with you, would you like to chat? :)", "the biggest change I have ever seen. (#1) (Theres no super obvious trigger warning stuff on here but I am not sure so TW i guess)\n\nThis is not a success story, the story is still being written, but if I succeed I swear on my life ill see to to it that those who have not succeeded succeed.\n\nI am a male, with SM.\n\nup until about 2 days ago, i did not fully understand the ego and pride.\n\nI could not understand why bullies would exist and relentlessly tear down people they viewed as inferior with no remorse.\n\nI did not understand why people would get arrogant and never listen when others tell them to do what is objectively the right thing, even when it would be easy for them.\n\nIt is cause \"losing\" was ingrained in my nature. I never had a chance to feel pride when I was very young, so later when i did get those chances it did not affect me.(keeping this vague on purpose, I am going to elaborate in another post eventually)\n\nI STILL THINK SM IS GENETIC, ill go into that maybe in another post, but after realizing that I had to gain an ego I improved by the largest fucking margin I have seen in my life.\n\nI had always thought \"conquering the fear\" was the way to cure SM, but using that approach nowadays I never had any major change, and only kept making myself feel scared.\n\nWhich is confusing because in 10th grade that was my approach, and It kind of worked.(Will also elaborate in another post) \n\nNow, maybe you might be thinking about the phrase \"love yourself\". The reason \"Love yourself\" never helped me, though I heard it very often online, was probably cause it kind of was not for me.\n\nI think that phrase would have the greatest effect to someone whos secure in some areas but (irrationally) insecure in others. Like if your hair is subpar one day and so you are less confident that day. that would not make sense to you because every other day you were fine. You would understand the love yourself message, because you have felt that way in other days, so you understand how to work on your pride to the point that you do not care what others think of your hair.\n\nIn reality, you viewed the people who would judge your hair as worth nothing to you, and so what they think now looks insignificant.\n\nNow I realize that the \"semifriends\" (people i talked to often but i stopped talking to them a while a go cause of reasons involving envy, I *might* elaborate on this) that I had never even told me to love myself. Maybe its cause I never directly asked for confidence help, though I did not do it for sure a few times indirectly. They also FOR SURE had reason to believe I was suffering.  I do not hate them for that, but it irks me a lot.\n\nFor me, I guess my ego was so astronomically low that the message never clicked for me. I would not say I overlooked the message, but it just was not straightforward enough to the point that I could understand it.\n\nWhen I hear it I am thinking \"love??? whadaya mean, how the hell do I love myself\" so I never really connected it with pride.\n\nMy ego is not at normal levels right now, but bruh lemme tell you when I realized all of this my ego went from like 0.1 to 2.5 instantaneously. I went from not being able to talk to people when I play apex to talking a LOT, like the \"wall\" just crashed to the point where its now next to nothing. This could also  be because I know I already have many reasons to have pride in myself. This makes me think about the phrase \"work on yourself\", which is another thing (elaborating in another post, im trying not to make this post a megalodon lololololol)\n\nPeople at a 10 are dangerous though, especially when they are in power. I understand that being in power is what gives them that ego, but that is no fucking excuse to ever accept their ways.\n\nThey do things like only work for themselves, pretend to be \"for the people\" cause it benefits them(with no shame too), and generally they think they are right cause almost no one else is worth anything to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. Yes, a lot of this will seem obvious to a lot of people. If it does, then I GUESS THIS MESSAGE WAS NOT FOR YOU HUH....\n\nIf it is not for you, it is not for you, move the heck on. Yes, there are people who neeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED this message (source: me, suffering my entire adolescent and teen life before two days ago).\n\nI will make more posts, though there is likely going to be a few days delay as I grow tbh.\n\nThere is just many thoughts running around in my head right now, I have ADHD so this is more than likely really hard to understand lol, I am trying to share the most important thoughts.\n\nI will make some edits though so if you do not understand something tell me!\n\nEventually I will make a \"perfect\" post that is clear to understand, as short as possible, and that everyone can benefit from. I definitely get this, before 2018 I was a wreck at least physically with my confidence around my family and in public. The only problem now is I still feel like a kid at 18, and I feel insecure around some guys and some girls. I know I should not but that is being honest with myself. That confidence is definitely helpful when overcoming SM.\n\nI feel like I am at the point where I could 'burst out,' but at the same time I am still afraid what I am saying is not as important....and I really do not know what to say with my sisters, my brother, my Dad, or my Mom. I wish they made more conversation with me, and such....maybe I will bring that up. My family is hard for me. Strangers are not as difficult when alone, I am just nervous. I also do not say more than the bare minimum, at least not currently at 18.\n\nThe last week has definitely been my most outgoing week, but I feel like I still need that one day of great change, just to break that 'wall.' I am trying to build on that week with this 1st-7th....but yeah.\n\nI agree though, SM definitely correlates pretty hard with self-confidence, you have to realize you do matter.\n\nEdit: My cats helped me get around more and build my confidence, now I will dance in front of my family...and move around a lot.", "A lack of speech as it relates to trauma I struggled with a lack of speech, all the classic SM symptoms starting at the typical age of like 4. I learned about selective mutism when I was 14, after googling \"social anxiety\", which I would heard about on TV. I talked to my parents about it, but they were abusive and neglecting and a huge trigger for my failure to speak so nothing ever came of that conversation. I was never diagnosed or treated and only overcame my failure to reliably hold basic conversations with others when I was an adult. Starting at that age of 14, whenever I was not in denial that I had a problem I blamed selective mutism for my inability to talk, but recently, I read about another explanation.\n\nI read and highly recommend a book called The Body Keeps the Score. The author talks about a trauma patient, a girl born to an addict mother, who is neglected and abused as a child and eventually ends up in foster care, who overcomes a total lack of communication with people around her, including social workers and therapists, thorough a relationship with a horse. That feels like a bad way of putting it but I cannot think of another way of succinctly saying it. The author never mentions selective mutism, but he goes on to talk about other patients who lose their voice due to trauma. He talks about refugees who survive war, genocide, literal atrocities, who reveal details of traumatic events in conversations with him but are struck dumb in conversations with judges who will decide whether they receive asylum or can safely go back to their countries. Because of their inability to convey that they will risk their lives if they go back to their war torn countries, they are denied it. He also mentions Broca's area and how it is responsible for language, but shuts down when a person goes into fight or flight mode.\n\nI  wanted to talk about other issues I had as a kid and teen that co-existed along with my lack of speech that this book also provides an explanation for. I know that others in this sub have shared stories of struggling with the same, so hopefully you pick up TBKTS and see if you identify with even more of what it covers. The other issues were poor academic performance and hygiene issues. Starting when I was very little I struggled badly in these areas and I could not figure out why I was like that, until TBKTS gave me insight into it. I think my lack of speech, lack of showering/changing clothes, and poor school performance were manifestations of a trauma \"( response. I could not comprehend the abuse and neglect around me and my automatic unconscious reaction was no reaction at all. I often slept my anxiety away. My history of being unable to basically communicate with the people around me made me feel helpless and every single issue I was struggling with fed itself. My shame, the shunning I experienced, my high anxiety all fed themselves and their derivatives. There was a marked snow ball effect going on.\n\nI used to think maybe I had autism because of the above. I would only heard of people with autism struggling with the above as much as I did. I now see having both trauma and autism as too complicated of an explanation, so my guess is I just have trauma. I even question if I ever had SM at all. I know that my lack of speech was one of my main preoccupations and what I subjectively felt was most holding me back. I think I needed support from my school in regard to accommodations, but have not ever developed a good working relationship with a psychiatrist who is not invalidating or near abusive or just abusive to help me figure out what happened. Anyway, I am sharing this in case it sounds familiar to any of you. All my life I felt like a basket case until I read that book and it covers all my major issues, so I do not have to self diagnose with everything on the DSM.\n\nFor those of you who struggle to talk and have trauma, self soothing techniques should be trauma informed. Trauma work is what has most helped me overcome my social anxiety, low self-confidence and communication issues. Two resources that might help: (\n\n(\n\n\\*\\*btw because of the bad experiences with invalidating shrinks I mentioned,  I created a subreddit called r/BadShrinks so we all can share horror stories, but also guide each other through finding real help\\*\\* Just my personal experience here. When I was in denial of being autistic, I tended to focus on the exact same resources. They are very helpful books for many neurotypes, anyway. But I think I really wanted to focus on seeing just the trauma without truly accepting disability. That is not to say that it is either PTSD or autism. I have a diagnoses of both due to a lifetime of maltreatment and neglect. Autistics are much more vulnerable to abuse and neglect than non-autistics, so it is a common morbidity. Not one or the other. But through time I have integrated these resources while still holding space for my vulnerabilities/disabilities in a neurotypical world, which made me more vulnerable to being mistreated. Finding that connection to ableism has helped with my shame and self understanding.\n\nAn example? As far as SM, I think there were multiple factors that made it that much \"worse\" for me. There was my relatively profound social disability (theory of mind) causing social anxiety, a communication difference caused by learning disabilities, and chronic emotional/sexual/psychiatric abuse. It was all part of what got me to that point. I was guilted into shying away from the idea that I could have autism and even SM. I was told I was making up stories for attention and that I was borderline suffering from Munchausen syndrome, even warned that if I had children I would abuse them through Munchausen by proxy.\n\nIt is not shame, it is fear that I will be harmed if I talk about autism or SM. I want to talk to an expert about it, but for right now, trauma work alleviates my symptoms and I honestly want to believe I do not have to worry about autism because where I am from I do not think I could find someone to take an adult woman seriously about it. Yeah, that type of conditioning has lifelong consequences. I feel that, and I am sorry you went through it. I was pathologized with similar behavioural labels in lieu of my disabilities and trauma being validated. I was a Black girl in the 90s, so systemically, most people saw my disabilities as a behavioural threat (and still do). It is horrible. \n\nI am glad Walker and Van der Kolk are helping. Trauma work is important. They taught me about things that are particularly important for traumatized autistics, like looking to your body when language and cognitive memory falls short. And learning my window of tolerance.\n\nAccessing an adult assessment (especially when you are not a man or not white) is a huge privilege. The reality is that it is rare and difficult to find support. It is a massive injustice. The fight persists. I hope you can find what you need.", "Hikikomori Brother UK - Please Help Hi everyone,\n\nHoping you cab help.\n\nMy little brother (Owain, now 31y) has not spoken a word to anyone in over 10 years.\n\nHe is highly intelligent (he got a place to study Mathematics at Warwick UK - if you do not take my word for it I guess) and the two of us once shared a close relationship growing up. One term he came home from university and never went back - our mum was not happy and they argued, it was almost as though he was giving her the silent treatment when it first started, but it never stopped. At this time myself and my older brother lived away from home and did not understand the extent of it. For the first few years of his isolation I did not understand what was going on with him - I still do not, in a way - and tried my best to engage him to no avail. \n\nOur father was an alcoholic and the dynamic in our family was always strained. At first none of us knew what to do and my folks hired in multiple therapists to try and 'fix' things. It was a different time I guess, obviously none of it touched the sides,\n\nAbout 5 years in or so we learned of Hikikomori, which made the most sense. But it really was not heard of in the UK in 2010. Mental health specialists we spoke to at the time told us they would never heard of such a thing - as they mostly do today. However, the term resonated with us as a way to explain the way Owain was acting or reacting to life. \n\nThe world is a more understanding and accepting place now than it was - ha, in some respects. I have learned a lot more about mental illness and neurodivergence. But what I really need right now is some sort of insight. Someone who understands him, or me. Or at least to not feel so alone and helpless in all of this.\n\nI love my brother and want to help him but I do not know how. I do not even know if that is possible now, its been so long. Life is short and meaningless but it should not have to feel this hard. \n\nIf you have any experience of this or anything you think could help, please reach out.\n\nSusie", "Panic.

I do not want to feel this way... but I have no power over my own life... I do not even know what I want from Burger King half the time... how long can I keep going like this... Well it is tough to give any very good advice because as this is a selective mutism subreddit, I am sure many of us are not familiar with poly relationships but that seems to my eye to be the root of the anxiety in this relationship. You sound a lot like I did when I was talking to a girl for a few months and later found out she was talking to others. You sound anxious about feeling not needed by her and perhaps jealous as well. Again, I am not sure how this particularly applies to SM but I do not like seeing people who need to share their feelings unable to be heard. I do not know you or anything about your romantic life but from my personal opinion I think poly relationships sound nice but often times lead to jealousy from one or both partners. I hope things get resolved safely and healthily, and maybe try and just find ways to relax. What I usually do when I am really upset like that is drink cold water, breathe deep, and do something that might make you smile. Play a relaxing game or watch a funny movie always helps me. I do get jealous. But jealousy gets worked on.\nThis is not that.\nThis is a rule we had that was purposefully broken. \n\nGood advice but I cannot even play a game right now. And everything I watch, she watches... so I start crying anyway...\n\nShe makes me smile............ She broke a fundamental rule in your relationship. You need to communicate with her about it, see if you can make peace. Emotions are easily forgotten so write them down, let her know how badly she hurt you. You will have to think if you are better off with her or without her, ask her if she wants to keep you in her life, and work from there to heal your bonds or break up. That shit hurts, I am so sorry you had to go through that level of breaking the trust you have between each other. Oh no, I am so sorry. I am also SM and in a poly relationship. Well, my husband decided he was poly after years of marriage and basically said I could let him cheat or he would just kill himself... yay, \"consentual non-monogomy!\" Anyway, I really think having the trauma background that leads to SM and being confident and mentally stable enough to tolerate being in a poly relationship are pretty incompatible. I mean, maybe it works for some people, but it makes sense that if you have already been hurt so much in life, you just are not going to be able to handle the extra drama and pain of being with someone who cannot prioritize you. Being abandoned when you are upset is traumatic on its own, for whatever reason. I am so sorry your partner did that. I know relationships are complicated and it is not as easy as just \"if they hurt you, just leave,\" but you deserve to be with someone who cares enough to take care of you and not just leave you when you are sad. I ask this in a supportive and caring way, have you considered checking in to the ER?    You are clearly in a crisis.  This feeling will not last forever.  It will get better as long as you survive the crisis you are in right now.", "Does anyone else not have the ability to laugh out loud? I can only laugh silently. All of my laughs that are heard are just me forcing them. My genuine laughs are silent. Anyone else like this? Yeah I really do not have a normal laugh, I honestly cannot remember the sound. Though I can definitely die of laughter if it is the right scenario. I have laughed so hard I have cried before. SM essentially causes vocal cord paralysis, so yes in many cases if you try to even make any sounds (like laughing) nothing will come out. I was the same way. Yeah same! I know I used to laugh loudly before (with family) but I got used to laughing silently from school so now I just do that. Thanks for replying :) Yes My laughs are always silent unless it is just me and my twin Whenever I think something is funny along for example classmates and I cannot hold in a laugh I just produce some weird noise because I am trying to hold it in\u2026 ugh I am cringing just thinking of it. Yes, or my laugh sounds weird or distorted. for me also any form of screaming also including trying to like scream as a joke with friends to see who is the loudest.

Hi all, I thought I would write a little about my experience with being selectively mute and my journey on overcoming it. \n\nI didnt know there was a name for my childhood experience until I was much older. I was always told I was \"shy.\" But that never sat with me well. I actually learnt about selective mutism about two years ago when I worked with a group of children. There was one child who would not speak at all to the adults, only to the kids. It reminded me so much of myself at that age. I guess I decided to look it up and stumbled upon selective mutism. \n\nFinally a name that fit with my experience. \n\nI am not sure when I first became selectively mute but I suspect it was quite early on. My mom said even as a baby I never cried. However, I had quite a traumatic first few years of life. So I have always suspected that the selective mutism stemmed from that. As all the symptoms I displayed align with a child who experienced trauma. \n\nAs a young child I dont think my selective mutism effected me much. I would talk to my peers and my teachers for the most part. However, it always comes out the most around supervisors or people of power. But I would say I mostly did not talk 99% of the time. And at times I just could not speak. No matter how hard I tried to will myself to.\n\nHowever, I can remember coming home and I would throw gigantic tantrums. Like hours and hours of crying and screaming. I can remember being so angry for absolutely no reason. I suspect this is in relation to the trauma but I would be curious to know if anyone else experienced this as well. \n\nIt was when I was a teenager where it really would effect me. It was embarassing, let us me frank. I can remember one time in particular where someone was talking to me and I could not talk back. I wanted to but I just could not. I hid behind my mom (I was taller than her at this point). All i could think was how embarrassing it was and rude that i couldnt even say one single thing. \n\nAround 16-17 I began to grow out of selective mutism. I cant say I did anything to start this process. I think getting my first job in customer service really helped though. After this I began to do things that scared me, a lot. I also began university and got my degree in social work of all things. \n\nI am actually quite personable now. I still feel i am not articulate. I especially find it hard to keep a conversation when I am not feeling well. \n\nWhere I still feel it the most? Is when I am talking to authority or my supervisor. I am not sure how it \"felt\" as a child but when it comes on now it feels like a large lump in my throat. When I push past it and talk I get on the verge of tears or my voice is shaky. Sometimes it coinsides with the situation but more often than not it comes out of nowhere. I feel embarrassed to explain that yes I am on the verge of tears but I promise I am okay. \nLuckily I have amazing coworkers. I work in child protection now (of all the things) and often have to have very hard conversations with people. But the upside of it is my coworkers get it. The effect trauma has on a child, even into adult hood. \n\nAnyways that is a very condensed short version of my experience. I am glad to have found a group of people who can understand to some extent on what I have experienced. Thank you so much for sharing! Thanks for taking the time to write this, I enjoyed the read! And I am so proud of you for overcoming SM &lt;3 Can relate to your early years and speaking. Thanks for sharing I had this problem too. I was a normal kid, I was quiet but I did not know until someone pointed it out years later. I was never popular but always he is a few friends, all quiet like me. The problem began when I started going to middle school. I went to a different school where I did not know anybody. It was hard for me to make new friends. This made me feel really bad, like something was wrong with me. To make matters worse, one classmate laughed at me because I did not have any friends, I would always be alone. When I started high school, I had a couple of friends, but when they dropped out, I was by myself again. I could tell some people felt bad for me and wanted to talk but when I would not talk back, they would just go away. I felt terrible for not being able to talk to people. In my early twenties I came up with depression and wanted to kill myself. I thought I was worthless for not being able to socialize. I checked in at a clinic and was prescribed Prozac. After this I decided to improve, I did not know how but I decided to force myself to talk more. It has been a long, painful process but I am in a better place now. I missed out a lot in my youth but now I am more confident. I am married with kids and I am well liked by most people. If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.\n\n**US:**\n\nCall 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741-741\n\n**Non-US:**\n\n(\n \n --- \n \n^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated. Thanks for sharing A wonderful post, thank you. Thank you, ironically my SM actually came out a lot this past week. I found myself at work not being able to speak to my supervisor or coworkers.i forced words out but they were not even close to being articulate. It is like I knew what I wanted to say in my head but I could not find the words when I went to speak. \n\nMore so than a little \"oh man what is that word I am thinking of.\" Thanks for sharing. My daughter has it &amp; she also goes through the exhausting tantrums. There is no winning the power struggles that surround the tantrums. I hope I can help her reduce the anxiety that seems to be the root of all that. The way the therapist explained, she has bottled so much up all day, so she has to release it somehow. Not sure if that might have been what fueled your's too? \n\nThen again, trauma can be sneaky. I do not believe trauma is what caused my daughter's SM, but she does have a hard time expressing her emotions. She shuts down when I try to ask intrusive questions. (She is 5, I would be shocked if there was trauma.) \n\nI am not sure if my determination to learn everything about SM could help her recover sooner.", "Selective Mutism in Adolescence | Kurtz Psychology  Thank you for sharing this.

Wish I knew that you could get a 504 back in high school. I had one for a vision disability, but dang having one for SM would have saved me so many panic attacks.", "how/when did yours start? I was a toddler and had apparently previously been vocal and normal when I suddenly completely stopped talking to my dad. This was not prompted by any particular event that I can recall, although my dad is a loud alcoholic and would yell at my brother and I to be quiet when he slept (during the day - he had a third shift job).\n\nThen I actually remember the first day of kindergarten and being totally overwhelmed and just not saying anything. That became the norm and people lost all expectation of me speaking. I think my SM really started in first grade. Prior to that, I was an outgoing kid/toddler. At the time my family had moved to a different country and we had to learn the local language on the spot (not to mention dealing with culture shock too). Being really young helped soak the language up like a sponge but I could never speak up in class and in big groups ...  The inability to speak up in groups still plagues me in my 30s... My mother also has some sort of personality disorder (maybe borderline) and she would take out her anxiety/anger on me. She had a short temper and would always yell at me and sometimes hit me. Whatever her parenting style was, it was definitely not about building confidence and learning to stand up for myself. Maybe SM was some kind of defense mechanism (but a very shitty one) Kindergarten for me and I was never an outgoing person to begin with. My family is not loud at all and both my parents have anxiety with my father being on the spectrum. According to my records at 18 months when i first went to preschool i never talked to any adults except my parents. Took 4 more years to get a diagnosis. My SM started when I was 3/4 years old, in preschool. Nothing necessarily \u201ctriggered\u201d or caused my SM. I was always anxious, even when I was just a few months old. I often had temper tantrums. My parents have also told me that when I was a baby, I would cry *everytime* they took me to a public place (I.e the zoo, the mall). I would stop as soon as I got home. When I went to preschool, when everyone else was playing, I just stood in the corner with my hands over my face. \n\nThe cause of SM remains unknown, as it is relatively rare. But here is a few that seem to play a role -\n\nGenetic predisposition - In other words, they inherited their anxiety from one or more family members. People with SM typically have parents that were very shy or had social anxiety. \n\nInhibited temperament - people with SM usually have very inhibited temperaments. In studies, people with inhibited temperaments are more prone to anxiety. \n\nBilingual/multilingual - SM is sometimes caused by learning another language, or moving to a foreign country. The stress and anxiety of speaking another language and being insecure about their skills can be enough to cause SM. Not diagnosed. Suspected by GP when I was young but parents never sought specialists. I never have myself either.  \n\nMy parents were immigrants. They are homebodies. We never went out at all. My exposure to people was very limited. Kindergarten started and I made friends with only a couple of kids. The cutural differences made it difficult to relate to other kids. I did not know anything about the typical interests of local kids. The rest knew me as the one who never talks. My report cards are all filled with comments about how I never participate in class. Not diagnosed either. My memory is patchy and parents never noticed anything too worrisome by their account (considered me shy), so I am uncertain how far back my inability to speak was in effect. I do not feel comfortable going into the details, but a sexual assault, denial of the act, and extreme harassment at school all starting at age 9 lead me to remaining silent to avoid attention. A teacher praised me once in front of the entire class for being silent, asking the other students why they could not be more like me. That was a pivotal moment that lead to me definitively equating speaking with being \"wrong\".  7-8 after parents got divorced then got worse in middle school and a little better and worse in certain situations in high school", "How can you tell selective mutism apart from autism ?

Not knowing her identity, he listens to her play on several occasions and bc of inconveniences he is always unable to record it on his phone so he kind of hums it to himself. this kind of leads him to hum things in public, and he very gradually over time it indirectly improves his ability to talk to people in certain situations. \n\nAre these okay to include in my story? If not, why? And also if there is way i can work around these ideas, I would love to hear any input. Someone being able to treat their own SM by humming does not make sense to me. I hummed music and hummed words (in my head it was words but outside it was humming) to myself all throughout elementary and middle school (for context, I was undiagnosed and did not know SM existed during this time), and absolutely nothing changed about my sm. The only thing that can change SM imo is some type of exposure. Humming is just something that mildly entertains you. Idk how you want to write your story but if the character must overcome their SM at some point, it would be waaaaay more accurate for him to do that via some type of exposure training.\n\nfor example (just a random scenario, this is just so you get the idea): He just barely gets a job as a cashier, and he uses the constant forced interaction with people as a way to train. He tries his hardest not to avoid the fear in any way. When he eventually gets comfortable doing the bare minimum as a cashier, he does \"confident\" things that trigger his fear again, in order to keep at it and get as normal as possible.\n\nWish you the best. thanks for the response it is helped me understand SM better!

Frustation leads to taking out that anger on whoever you can. It is pretty straightforward. It is not right, but that is how people are in general, not just people with SM. For many with SM (but certainly not all), home is the one place we can communicate freely, so it is the only outlet. When a person (does not have to have SM) they lash out at the people who are closest to them. Why? It is because they trust them. Sometimes (especially teens) cannot regulate their emotions, so they either go withdrawn or use violence. They go after the ones they love because they do not know how to regulate their emotions, it is hard and when someone does not understand something, they lash out. \nMost of time you have to tell the person it is okay to feel like this, it is okay to feel angry, hurt and be confused. It is part of human nature. You do not have to have SM to feel emotions, especially negative ones.", "So I started high school today And one of my classes is theater um I do not thank theater and selective mutism mix very well.

So I guess this is life telling me to do it.", "I think I could have selective mutism but I am not sure I am making this post to see if my symptoms are similar to anyone elses with this disorder. It would just be helpful to know if I do have this disorder, or if it is just social anxiety, since I cannot really get anything properly diagnosed at the moment.\n\nI only recently found out about this anxiety disorder, but I feel like this is what I have been experiencing. I am 16, and most of my life I have just assumed I had social anxiety, but I always knew it was a bit worse than that. I have had the same friends for years, and I only really feel comfortable talking to them and family, and nobody else. I started college this week, and I was very anxious leading up to it, but I was trying to prepare myself for talking to classmates, having discussions and trying to make friends. However, when I got to the classes and we had to talk to each other in groups, I just froze and could not speak. I wanted to at least try to talk to people, but I just did not have the confidence and was just silent the whole time. I have realised that this has happened a lot in the past. If I did not know anyone around me in school, I would often just not talk at all.\n\nHowever, I am wondering if it is just social anxiety and not selective mutism, as it is ultimately all just because of my inability to start conversations, or talk to people first. If they talk to me I can give a short answer (I still cannot carry on the conversion), but I do gain a little confidence to speak.

On top of this, you know that other people could say what you wanted to say with no problem cause it is normal.\n\nIf you go blank sometimes but are otherwise fully social, then please reconsider whether you have sm.\n\nDisclaimer: \n\nI am not accusing anybody of false diagnosing, and absolutely not these commenters.\n\nIf you are active on this sub then you most likely have nothing to worry about. I am just sharing my thoughts. I just do not want the worst case scenario of people without SM coming to this sub seeing comments like these and using them as an excuse to say that have SM.\n\nI do not know what the blanking out thing really is. It could be another unnamed or even named mental condition, but calling it SM would cause confusion. I agree, but only to an extent. Experiencing that by itself is not always enough to be considered SM, but it *can* absolutely be a symptom of SM. Back when I was diagnosed and had not recovered yet, if someone were to walk up to me unexpectedly and ask me a question, I would completely freeze, shut down, and be unable to think of anything to say or respond. SM is characterized by the freeze response, so it is a pretty common experience. Ok, but I do not think the brain resetting thing is what those commenters are talking about. There are three distinct scenarios here, I think.\n\nThe first scenario: your brain resets mid-conversation, and you forget what you were going to say. This might be something that happens to everybody, similar to how you might walk into a room and forget what you came there for. I am not sure. I know it happens to me occasionally when I am talking to the few people I can comfortably talk to.\n\nThe second scenario: you cannot talk on the surface level. You have things to say, but you cannot get them out. This is definitely selective mutism.\n\nThe third scenario: you cannot talk on a deeper level. Your brain will not even produce things for you to say. It is not like your brain resetting, because it happens constantly when you are in certain situations. You are not just forgetting what to say, because you probably never came up with anything in the first place. You might even start to wonder if you are just stupid, but then you remember you have no problem thinking of things to say in other situations. I think this is also selective mutism, just a different expression of it. \n\nAll three of these scenarios have happened to me, but it is only the latter two that I associate with selective mutism. Both of them only happen in situations where I am anxious. I am also fairly certain that for me, they have the same root cause. I am not a psychologist and I cannot say for certain that there should not be separate descriptors for each, but I suspect many people with SM have experienced both. This phenomenon is a side affect of anti depressants It sounds like it is a processing issue (delay). Its happened to me many times way before i took antidepressants. Maybe they amplify how often blanking out happens but they cant be the cause of blanking out Maybe it is just me but when I went off them I could think again. Depressants made me the zombie like state most people describe so I figured this is a side affect The blanking out part sounds like ADHD. It is like the channels change every few seconds and your brain resets leaving you clueless in the conversation or with a blank brain and nothing to say. Having a conversation is like trying to fit the puzzle pieces together but you do not have all the pieces. I dunno but this is a good explanation. I joined this sub to figure out if I have it or not, but I have all three of these happen constantly This might be an adhd thing", "Support group for AvPD? A little joke, but probably no one attends the meetings. But seriously does anyone know if there such a thing? r/AvPd is quite large", "How do you deal with your SM during the holidays? I am wondering how others with selective mutism deal with the pressure of the holidays. The pressure of being around others, conversations, dinners, etc. I have come pretty far in the past 2 years, but I still have A LOT of struggles to overcome. I am feeling super anxious about Thanksgiving on Thursday. One of my cousins asked my mom if she could join us for dinner and then when my mom called her, she added in that her boyfriend would be joining. None of my family has met him. I do not feel like going through the whole thing of meeting this guy when I just want to eat some food and relax. I have SM as well. I have a very large extended family, and they do not really understand. They are all very loud, so they think I am just \u201cshy\u201d and always try to talk to me and literally tell my parents that I am being rude and \u201cnot respecting my elders\u201d- ok boomer lol- but in all seriousness, I have an IPhone, so I use the notes app and have a bunch of things typed out on there, one explaining that I have SM and saying what it is. That way people understand that you are not just \u201cquiet\u201d. I have been in a similar situation as you, actually. This was about 3 years ago, so my older brother would have been around 17. I was 11, and he is really supportive of me, he did ask me first privately if it would be alright if his girlfriend, Ava, came to have dinner with us. It was not a holiday or anything, she just wanted to meet his family. All of my other siblings are very loud to say the least, I have two older brothers and a younger sister and brother, which are twins. Anyways, usually I can slip under the radar and all of them combined are loud enough that I kind of go unnoticed. Not really in a bad way, I like it that way, but yeah. Ava is also a very quiet person. I would seen her once before this particular dinner, but that was the extent of it. I did not know anything about her other than what my brother said. I expected her to be kind of loud and crazy, as my brother is, but she is awesome. She said hello to us all personally and asked us our names. I got my notes app ready. When she got to me, I showed her my name. She smiled and did not ask any questions and treated me like anyone else. After she left, my brother told me that he had explained it to her, and that she had a little brother who had SM, which is rare, so that was awesome. Anyways, my advice to you is to explain to your cousin that she should probably talk to her boyfriend first, but make sure she knows that he is welcome. Have some notes ready, and you will be all set! Have a good Thanksgiving!

But at work or any other situation most of the time I can barely talk to people. I have so much anxiety, and do not want to be humiliated. And my mind will even freeze up so that I cannot think of anything to actually say. I am not like that at home with my kids. We chat away all the time. And I was like that as a kid too..

Idk I just do not buy this argument that SM is always caused by autism or something wrong with the amygdala. Well maybe..I do not know. \n\nIf the amygdala is the part of the brain that controls the flight/fight/freeze response than I would think being bullied and abused at home could mess up the development of that part of the brain.\n\nBut basically I think got bullied a lot as a kid and developed SM from that.", "People who trigger SM Hi, I am wondering if anyone has the experience of certain people triggering selective mutism?  And how that feels? And how to deal with being around those people if you have any advice?  \n\n\nIn my experience, it is usually consistently the same people and often people I really love or really want to be around but I cannot say anything and when I try super hard to speak word jumble comes out.  Sometimes, it feels like I forget all my words and the only way I can pretend to speak is by repeating the same words they have said in different configurations but this makes me feel like I am stupid. And even this way of piecing sentences together is the best case scenario usually I just cannot say anything and it is not like there is something I wish I could say-- it is really like my brain is so confused or overwhelmed that it cannot compose a sentence.  Are you saying you can speak to someone one day but you might not be able to speak to the same person another day? more so that i completely shut down around certain ppl/(&amp;also groups) but it seems like there are certain people i can still talk to no matter what (but only oneonone) This happens to me too", "I stopped talking to my parents when I was 15 and I do not know why Could this be selective mutism?\n\n  \n\n\nIn that time I did not talk a lot to anyone but to my parents I COULD NOT.

Definitely sounds like it.", "I think I have selective mutism So I am 38. I was picked on in school, eg, few years I sat alone in the cafeteria full of a hundred kids. My parents were physically abusive. I do not mean one time i got slapped and still whine about it. Dad would punch me in the head repeatedly on a fairly regular basis, make me sleep outside in Western Pennsylvania in snow storms. I guess that is fairly common with Irish Americans as we are on that side. Mom Jewish, one time left a mixing bowl of ramens for me on the porch like a dog bowl in the dead of winter after she locked me, in an extremely rural mountainous area, so she was fucking insane too.\n\nSomewhere along the line I just stopped talking to class mates in probably middle school. Like I would sit through all of homeroom and never speak to anyone. What for....But I was fine with friends through my brother(a year younger, and very popular), at karate class, and at home (my parents would be normal in between bouts of crazy). \n\nAt 17 I moved in with my grandmother and did not have much of a social life for a few years after that. I had a friend or two. I think it really got worse then, because I lost my ability to be social with people also outside of school.\n\nNow at 38 I am rarely comfortable around other people, i can talk but only a few words of small talk and I have the urge to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. I try to fight it, but I seriously go into fight/flight mode, emphasis on flight. Obviously if I am drunk the problem goes away but that is not a very good solution to get drunk everyday, and I only drink occasionally with my only friend.\n\nI would like to work on my speaking anxiety but work nights alone and do not have the chance to go to any kinds of social events. \n\nIs there a chance to improve at 38? I think so..I think just forcing myself into uncomfortable situations is the way to go. But I am really not sure how to go about it.  \n\nI mean there is people at work a few hours a day, but long story short, I became religious around 27 and moved to Israel. I did not integrate, few Americans here do, they mostly associate with other English speakers..So now there is this whole additional problem of basically being a permanent outsider within society, regardless of how much I speak. \n\nSo even when I try to talk at work and sometimes I do, it never really goes anywhere, and I really think it is more that just I am a quiet guy or whatever. I think there is this whole dimension of being a designated outsider on top of severe social anxiety. 38 is by no means too late to help help and improve your mental health! It sounds like you have had a lot of traumatic experiences. Speaking to a professional mental health specialist is probably the best way to get guidance on methods you can use to improve your state of. mind. CBT can be very helpful in particular for anxiety conditions.\n\nSecond language environments interact with social anxiety in a big way. While you might never become an 'insider' you can become more comfortable though. One odd thing I found while living in a second language environment was that my personality in the language was quite different than my personality in English. Both were me, but my second-language self was kind of more simple, I guess, because I did not have the vocab or grammar for complex thoughts. After a few years it became relaxing to be that version of me. I found that having one area that I could talk about well, in my case food, was very helpful in building up confidence. \n\nIt sounds like you have pretty good self-insight, recognising that drinking is not a good solution, and that exposure to discomfort is part of the process of recovery. Our brains can change and adapt our entire lives. Whatever you make your brain practice, it will get better at. If you have been practicing being solitary and quiet, it will be good at that. Practicing talking and being sociable will be uncomfortable at first, but if you think it will make you happy, it is worth pushing through. I found thinking of it as practice to be very helpful in not judging my efforts.\n\nIf you do not have access to professional help right now, you might find this useful as a guide to some techniques to help lower your anxiety and structure a plan of exposure: ( The website has a bunch of other science backed mental health self-care guides too. I cannot add to this. I definitely have social anxiety or selective mutism issues, ever since middle school at least, but I would like to improve them to whatever extent is possible at my age. It is always tempting to blame exterior sources. But at the same time I think it could part of it is just being here. I did not write this.\n\n\n\n\"The longer you are in Israel the more you feel like an immigrant and not a \u201cvatikim\u201d or \u201cveteran Israeli\u201d or \u201csabra.\u201d  Subtle things, like not having served in the army, or being in a youth group, or growing up as part of a close-knit homogenous community, will make you realize over time that you mostly only associate with other outsiders.  Some will find their way towards membership, but most will not.  Many will leave Israel\" Non-AMP Link: (\n\nI am a bot. ( | ( | ( It sounds to me like you have a lot more than selective mutism going on. Do not consider this a diagnosis by any means, but I think you should read about some of the following disorders:   \nSocial Anxiety (if you only have anxiety around others)  \nGeneralized Anxiety (if you are always anxious, but it gets worse around others)  \nAvoidant Personality Disorder  \nPTSD (specifically C-PTSD if you do not feel like PTSD fits you)\n\nYou should also find a therapist to see about this too. It is so hard to figure out what the \"right thing\" to do that will help you recover is without the insight of someone who is helped many people through these things already. \n\nIt does not matter what age you are, if you are 9 or 109. If you can talk to someone and process things, a therapist can help you understand how your brain is working, and then how to slowly change things to make it better. Even if you struggle to talk (especially at first), if you find the right therapist, they will find a way to work with you to get you past that point with them. You are not too late, people can improve and change until they die as lomg as they are willing to put in some work. You clearly are willing to work towards easing this problem you have. I recommend looking into self help guides, trauma, mental illness in general, and seeing where you stand. Definitely talk about your problems with a professional. Or write. Or learn sign language and sign. I do not know, whatever works. This community is good for peer support and experiences, do feel free to stay and utilize it like any other of us. You deserve love and support through this. Take care of yourself You are right. I was told once I am avoidant personality disorder, when I about 19. He also said it is incurable and untreatable. the therapist said it is from a bad relationship with my mother. But i have not seen a therapist in over a decade Because it is a personality disorder, it is definitely going to be more stubborn than something like... anxiety. It is in its nature. But that does not mean that you cannot work on the things with it that cause you the biggest problems. \n\nI have got it too, and I know a decent amount about it because of that (as well as everything else I listed in the post except Social Anxiety). The biggest reason that I am not focusing on working on the problems that AvPD gives me is because, for now, I have decided that I would like to take some time and work with them. I want a little life experience working against and with them, and then decide what parts of it are bothersome enough to change. If I can live a life that it does not impede, then it is technically no longer considered a disorder. It has to negatively affect how you live to be one. \n\nI do know that if I decide to change any of them, they will be stubborn as hell to do anything about. It is part of my personality. Just like Neurotic Personality Disorder. It started as a reaction to things happening around me, taking on too much responsibility too early and too often, and now it is just... who I am. \n\nBut who we are is still flexible. If I decide I no longer want to the kind of person who has a specific gut reaction to something, I can find ways to slowly expose myself to that thing and consciously change my gut reaction. Key word slowly. \n\nDefinitely get to a therapist, but come up with questions that you will use to vet them. Check their opinions on things you have hard boundaries on, check that they will not belittle or gaslight you, even without intending to. Check that they will listen, and their advice works for you, and do not be afraid to tell them it is not working and find someone else. Hopefully this helps.. I am around your age with a similar story-abuse at home, I stopped taking in school from kindergarten until 8th grade but would be able to talk in some other situations. Since then, I have had what I just figured was bad social anxiety, I definitely relate to the fight or flight, emphasis on flight. I used alcohol to cope for awhile, but did not really want to go down the same alcoholic path as my parents. What really has helped me was learning that I have Cptsd and not that I am trying to diagnose ya, but I would bet you do too. (seriously most people if not everyone has childhood trauma to some extent, it is not so much a diagnosis as learning how the things that happened to you affected you) I would recommend checking out r/cptsd, books- the body keeps the score, complex ptsd by Pete Walker, there is many others you can find. I have really come a long way this year working with my cptsd, that \"flight\" is really reduced after years of trying everything else for social anxiety with nothing really sticking. Anyways, you totally got this whichever way you go, you are a survivor for sure, self aware and seem like an awesome person. Good luck to ya! I try not to think about the AvPD since the psychologist said there is nothing to be done and anyways it seems like mostly I behave like I have selective mutism. I have avoided (no pun intended) therapist in Israel because it is so expensive here, and go largely untreated. I do communicate a lot through writing, people always tell me I am a great writer. I think it is from being the form of communication that I am most comfortable with. (I am not trying lay on the literary sauce here). But I really do want to work on this issue. it is very weird how a few bad years can just doggedly hound you and harass you for the rest of your life. It is so long ago I do not remember most of what happened anymore. But then i still have to deal with the consequences everyday, and this is decades later. For example, I have a mini supermarket in my apt building downstairs. I do not have food for breakfast and will scrounge the cabinets for anything to eat rather than having to be around people for 15 minutes and buy some basics of sustenance.  I constantly put it off, even buying food, even when it is right downstairs. Oh I totally understand literally all of that. I have always been a much better writer than speaker as well (if you have not noticed the novels of posts I have been writing haha). I have also talked with a couple of other people in Israel who really needed therapy as well, but they were in the same situation. It is really unfortunate. You can check if you would be able to use some service like BetterHelp. I am not sure if it is limited just to specific regions, and the therapy is probably in English (people are shown to process emotion best in their native language, although if you learned English at a young enough age, it should also work fine.) But it is usually cheaper than seeing a therapist in person at least, but I have heard some really terrible things about the quality of care you get from a lot of them. \n\nOne thing I have learned about mental illness above everything is that it kicks you when you are down. If you are already doing poorly, that is when it makes itself known the most, and it can entirely prevent you from getting better. \n\nIf you cannot remember what happened, it is possible that it is because it was so long ago, or my problem is I have dissociative amnesia. I do not remember large chunks of my childhood, and I am just missing from mid 2016 to the end of 2019. I can remember some of the things I learned in that time, but next to nothing about what or when what happened beyond \"I have been telling myself that I lost my job in this time\" or so, but I do not remember the event itself. \n\nAnd if your AvPD is affecting you to that extent, I definitely urge you to do something about it. I prefer to avoid people as well, but not to that extent. As long as you eat something instead of starving so you do not have to interact or be around other people, it is still technically okay, but it sounds like it is really close to interfering with your life in a pretty severe way if it gets any worse. \n\nI am at the point of... I do not *want* to go down and be around others, but if there is not much in my cupboards, it is not that much of a problem to get myself to do it. But I definitely hoard food to keep from having to leave the apartment more than absolutely needed. Since the start of 2020, it is been about once a week with exceptions for doctor visits, but I have been keeping an eye on if I am avoiding it because I feel I need to (giving into my disorder) or because I want to. I will make myself do something outside just because I have not worked on it in a while at times, to make sure my comfort level does not slip further down.", "diagnosis question ", "Join Dr. Aimee Kotrba and Katelyn Reed, MS for a facebook live event on Thursday, April 25 at 12:15 pm EST to address FAQ about Confident Kids Camp and individual intensive therapy for children with Selective Mutism.

Does anyone else have this issue? I also have this problem lol. Just have to keep trying. Every awkward conversion is an improvement I have the same problem lol, but lately I have been looking at life in a more \"who cares if they judge you, nothing actually bad will happen if they do\" kind of way, and it is sort of helping.\nIf you cannot think of anything to say, you can talk about something you were thinking about recently, or learn a list of open-ended questions (which will make them do most of the talking lol) and ask follow up questions. I know it is not easy but the only way to improve is to practice. Good luck! Mid thirties, same problem. I wish I had advice for you but I understand completely. I recently read a study about a simple way to get people to like you. Ask them a question about themselves, and then 2 followup questions. Even better, you do not have to talk much!\n\nThe \"mind going blank\" thing is part of stress. So it is OK to prepare a couple of generic questions like \"where did you grow up?\" and then followup questions like \"Oh, so what did you like about growing up there?\" Most people like to talk about themselves and what they like, and it makes it sound like you are a great listener. I am turning 18 in less than a week and have this same problem. I just wish I could make people understand how hard it is to think when you are panicking so badly. I know you will overcome this though, good luck! I am nearing 30 and I had the same issue but with time and practice it gets better. For me, I started listening closer to what people were saying and then I tried to ask them general questions about the topic and hope that they like to talk about it. If there is awkward silence, I begin to ask them about themselves and what they like. People love talking about themselves so that usually works for me unless there is two of me then its that spiderman pointing meme situation I know exactly how it feels, I have been lucky enough to gravitate towards very extroverted people, that can carry the conversation. Through this I have learnt what sort of questions to ask and how to carry a conversation. I still have a lot to learn, but I am getting there. Currently I only have a few friends, because it is very difficult to take that first step to start talking to someone, that is where the internet has helped me a lot. I have met people through games and so on, I usually tell them I am a bit awkward when it comes to new people and so far everyone has been very understanding. \n\nIt is going to take some time to feel comfortable in conversations and take that step to get to know people, but starting of with internet buddies is way easier (imo). If you ever need someone to talk to, I am available if you feel like it (I am 19 btw). Good luck! I know it will get better You are quite interesting! Can I learn the mindset of not worrying about what others say ? Would love to connect with you . That is amazing ! Can we have some conversation whenever you are free ? I am also facing this problem. Let us be open to each other whenever you feel better just ping me \ud83d\ude42 Yeah i feel this way. The only things i can honestly think of is stuff to do with my hyperfixations which ik no one cares about or even knows enough about to care. Plus when people try to talk to me my mind immediately goes empty and i have nothing to say even if i could speak Almost 30 same thing lol. People do not even give me the benefit of a doubt to even assume that I struggle with selective mutism and social anxiety and call me stuck up or a bitch. My best advice is therapy. I do not have insurance and I am struggling. I realized that I had a problem until it was too late. Does it help to talk to people online? It is not the same, but it can be some practice. Also, perhaps an activity where the topic itself could be a conversation starter and something to ask questions about. Like other people have said, it is great to have something to ask people about. \nGood luck! Yeah, this is common for people with SM and who are introverted in general. Small talk sucks. When i get to feeling like this, I usually ask people a question. \n\nIf it is in passing, something like, \"hows your day going so far?\" And I smile. That encourages them to feel grateful and gets me on the right track too.\n\nIf it is longer thing like a road trip, I usually listen and then ask questions. Then I look for similar interests. If they are a good fit for a friend for me, I find they will also take an interest in my and my life too. \n\nI used to think a blank mind was bad... but actually, you are in a more meditative state bc you are not experiencing racing thoughts or constant dialog in your mind. People practice for years to attain this. They have a discord server for sm, but we are not a lively discussion group... for obvious reasons. Is there somewhere a list of open ended questions? This. I do not have SM, but for some reason, I never learned proper social skills until after high school... I observed others who I admired and mimicked them. I had many awkward moments where a social choice I made was not the right one, and I am finally a lot better. I finally blend in. Just keep practicing and do not be afraid to make awkward mistakes! You will laugh at yourself later. :) yep. I am 20, almost 21, I quite literally have not left my room except for maybe 30 hours a year (excepting two years I went to uni in person) my whole life.

I do not want to send her to therapy if it is really me who needs better training at this age\u2026 I am considering enrolling us all in communicamp this fall at the SMART center in Philly. \n\nI want to do everything I can to help my daughter. I can tell that she is very, very uncomfortable in most social situations. I do not need her to be a social butterfly, but I DO want her to be happy and to be able to enjoy herself around family and friends. Is that realistic? She is so smart and funny and sweet. Even with no words! I wish other people could see her the way I see her. Is there anything your parents could have done to help you more? Anything you wish you could have told them when you were younger? Anything you wish they knew? I hope I am not invading your space. Hope you all have a nice weekend. Honestly, as an SM kid, i think the best way is to give her time. Alternate methods of communication also help me, i was not allowed to learn ASL when i was younger because it was deemed avoidance, but it is immeasurably useful. Celebrate the small victories too, and understand that no matter how much it sucks SM will never *entirely* go away - it will get 100x better with time and therapy, but it will never disappear. Start with little things like stomping feet or clapping hands to make sounds, then move up to single letters or animal noises or however you can make it a game. Do not try to trick her into talking. \n\nThis was a complete mess of a response lol but hopefully you can get the gist of it. It is awesome to see parents like you that are taking the initiative and trying to get your daughter help, especially by listening to the \u2018voices\u2019 of actual people with SM. I find that most parents go off of books from people who have never experienced SM, and the fact that you are asking us directly means a lot. Thank you, and I wish you and your daughter the best &lt;3 I think for me the biggest thing was being forced into saying stuff, because I wanted to speak so badly, but the words just never came out, and then on the times where I could speak, I then decided I just did not want to because there was so much pressure and I did not want to get it wrong. Also if she finds something or someone that she is comfortable talking to, such as a toy or pet, do not make a big thing out of it, it might be best to just not even mention it for a while because it might just scare her into thinking you will be listening and then not interact with it again. Another thing was when I was in school, or my parents friends etc whenever I finally built up the courage to actually speak, there would be comments like \u2018oh wow she can speak\u2019 even when they knew fully well I could speak and they were just saying it sarcastically, my parents never defended me when they heard these comments even if they never said it themselves, so defend her and correct them if anyone ever says something like that. Finally, really try and avoid telling her to stop talking or to be quite if she does get the confidence to talk, obviously there has to be a limit somewhere but for me the only place I was comfortable speaking was at home, so when I was told to be quite at home if I wanted to speak and they were doing something, it massively knocked my confidence which affected how much I spoke in other places aswell. I hope this helped, sorry it was so long and it is great you are actively trying to help your daughter :) I would say the best advice to you is to realize that school will be very hard for her. Little things that other kids love like group projects, partner sharing, show and tell, PE, etc would literally keep me up all night and ponder suicide. \n\nAlso do not tell her you wish you had a different kid that was not a loser and was normal like my dad did. Yes, this is good advice. To reiterate, please do not EVER trick your daughter into talking. She needs you on her side. She needs to be able to come to you with anxiety, anger, and sadness. \nI applaud you for getting her into treatment. But maybe sometimes take a step back and let her breathe. Is not talking really the worst thing in the world? Of course help her find her voice, but also accept her for who she is. exactly. treatment should focus on reducing the anxiety, and eventually talking will be a side affect of that  Thank you all both so much for sharing your experiences and advice. It is much appreciated. School will be using a communication board with pictures that she can point to, and she is really expressive with little noises/grunts/head movements. I absolutely want her to know that I am on her side and want to be someone she can come to for comfort. You are so right that not talking is not the end of the world. Can you all give me an example of tricking someone in to talking? I am not sure I know what that looks like\u2026 Thank you for the advice. It is good to make sure my expectations are realistic, and this will be good to remind myself when things are difficult. My heart wants so badly for \u201cthe little things\u201d to NOT be hard for her, but if that is something that cannot change, then I want to be someone that she can go to if she is ever having such a hard time. I am so, so sorry that you ever felt that way. And even more sorry that your dad said that to you. That is truly awful. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you! An example would be I would be chatting away at my mom as I normally would but someone else would sneak into the room without my knowledge. I was under the impression I was alone with a safe person, but I really was not. Or being promised that I would not be forced to speak in a situation, but once I get there the tables are turned and I find out that I have to. Things like that. Trust is paramount. for me, it was things like recording me talking \nwithout my permission or forcing me into situations where i would have to talk. even just the little things like my dad saying \u2018oh yeah, liv *hates* dogs\u2019 because he know how much i would want to correct him. things like that make it seem like you are trying to force the child into speech. try and remind her that her worth is not inherently linked to her voice. I wish they encouraged me to speak as much as possible, did not react adversely to me speaking, let me finish fully speaking when I tried.\n\nI am one who cannot speak to family/those I know....but can to those that do not know me. Still at 18, I am in it. Although the last 2 weeks is really the time in which I have become actively encouraged to change.\n\nEdit: Honestly, when it comes to reacting it is good or bad. I just do not want a reaction from me talking. It makes my mind think that talking is not normal for me and therefore I should not do it.", "i may have sm?? (edit: just want to apologize for such a long post. did not realize how long it was and i am not sure if anyone will read it all but the words just kept coming lol) \n\ncompletely new here just recently like 10 minutes ago realized i may have sm. ive known ive had social anxiety for years. i am currently 20 and around 12-13 is when i feel like i really noticed the social anxiety and it got progressively worse. but it always felt different for me than others who also have social anxiety. like obviously itll be different for everyone but a big thing is like i just physically cant talk to people sometimes. i often times know what i want to say or what i should say but i literally cant bring myself to say it.  ive always read social anxiety is the fear of what others will think of u and i do feel that a lot but a lot of times, what i want to say is good or normal or is something that would make them like me more but i just. cant. say. it. \n\nthinking back now, i can think of several examples like how i didnt say a word to any of my pre-k teachers but talked to my friends in class. a big thing is that i literally will not talk around certain people. the earliest i can remember doing this is around 3rd grade and it progressively gets worse. even if i want to talk, i cant bring myself to say anything. i was in basketball in 6th grade and my coach was saying hi to every team member and everyone said hi back but i couldnt. he got mad and made the entire team (including me) run across the gym and back continually until i said hi. after a few laps i finally gave in but it made me so anxious like i wanted to say hi but i just could not and i dont know why. once, an adult from my church wanted me to talk (i couldnt talk to Anyone from that church and they all always tried to get me to) and he was like i have a dollar right here if u just say hi to me. i was like 10 and $1 was a big deal so i reallyyy wanted to and it was awkward because there were other people there in the room too but i just stared at him and couldnt do it and he eventually left. my dad later scolded me for being rude. i have countless stories where i want to talk but there are certain people (a very big list) where i just wont talk even if i want to, especially in peer social interactions\n\nit is so natural to me now, i am always hyper aware of who is in the surrounding area so that i know if i can talk or not. i am most comfortable around my mom and can mostly freely express myself with her. she is the most i am comfortable with and other family members and friends i am more comfortable than other people but still on edge a little. if i am with my mom and one other person i am not comfortable talking around, as soon as the person leaves i can immediately start talking to my mom (and vice versa, if im with just my mom talking ill immediately shut up if someone else walks in) \n\noh also i want to say that it is really just verbal communication. i am completely comfortable being myself over text or typing. or even like gestures/facial expressions like if i want to be nice to someone who i cant bring myself to talk to i smile or if someone asks a question i am confronted nodding yes/no, etc. idk what any of this means and what all sm covers but anyway\n\nit is annoying because of how it affects every aspect of my life. i moved right before i started high school and i didnt make a single friend at all in high school. i just recently graduated college and towards the end i made a couple friends i met on the bumble app and we text everyday and i love them but when we hang out (which is rare bc were always busy) im super awkward and barely talk. i cant interact professionally to save my life and i get bad performance reviews when deep down i know what i should have done but just couldnt. i cant even talk to half my family like for christmas when everyone comes over i maybe say 5 words the whole few days. i love my family and have things to add to the convo but physically just cant. idk i feel like im not getting out of life what i could and that i missed out on so much because of it. i am scared to miss out on even more \n\nanyway idk what the point of my post is just kind of talking things out. maybe if anyone else relates or anything it could help validate my feelings idk sorry its soo long!! just straight up ranting right now", "What are some jobs for people with selective mutism?  Uhhhhhhh programmer? \ud83d\ude2c I like working in the kitchen in restaurants. Do not have to interact with customers, interactions with coworkers can eventually get slightly easier as you get to know them and they get used to you not talking anyway and do not really mind as long as you work hard and do your job. Also bussing tables. You may occasionally get asked a question by a customer but way less than servers and cashiers Idk about that one. My father's a programmer and he does a lot of talking in telephone conferences and so on Online artist/programmer/etc! IT tech guy for somewhere small, all you got to say is \u201cwhat is wrong?\u201d or \u201cturn it on and off\u201d copywriter? It is what worked pretty good for me. For many years I managed to keep my communication very limited and except occasional issues it never caused bigger problems. Also, as I recently got somehow better, it gave me opportunities to slowly increase my exposure to the others, in my own tempo.\n\nBut: my main problem is social anxiety, mutism is for me only a symptom. Translating written works. Specific, but if you know two languages simple. This really depends on the individual. Programming requires effective communication. A career will not get very far if it all off the ground if you expect that it is mashing at the keyboard the entire time without having to talk to anyone. The software development process is inherently social. art maybe work with deaf/hard of hearing people. or maybe teach sign language!", "Are you guys completely unable to talk? I have selective mutism due to severe social anxiety. Has had it since the age of 7 or so. Now I am 22. It has definitely gotten better than before, but it is still a very major hindrance in my life. I can pronounce separate words like \u201cHello\u201d, \u201cThank you\u201d, \u201cOkay\u201d and other basic ones. But I cannot squeeze out enough for a normal conversation. Was wondering if anyone else is like that. I have never met another person with selective mutism. I cannot have normal conversations either, unless it is with close friends and immediate family members.\n\nWith everyone else it feels really forced to talk with them. And I never initiate the conversation, I usually just answer questions people ask me. Yes that is how it is for me, typically. I will freeze with my mouth open, but nothing comes out. Usually it is like \"uhhhh\" for a few seconds until I just start using my hands. I still giggle a lot out of embarrassment and this sort of comical frustration. It depends on the day and who I am saying it to. If everyone is saying \"thank you\" (like to a bus driver or someone holding a door open) I can say it too. But if someone says hi to just me, or someone holds a door open for just me, I either mouth the word \"hi\" or I kind of just make a noise that sounds like \"thank you.\"\n\nI always feel so impolite. I have had it since I started school (about 4/5) and I am 18 now. I cannot speak at all unless I really force myself, and then it might be only like a mumble, it is not worth my anxiety attack.. I can talk normally to my family though. Just anyone outside that, nope.. i can talk but sometimes my mouth freezes like I have cramps so cannot make sounds", "Writing Selective Mutism Hello. I hope this is allowed in the subreddit. If not, please notify me and I will remove it.\n\nSo, I am writing a narrative. In it, there is a character with selective mutism. I was wondering whether you have tips on how to write her properly and avoid negative tropes? She has anxiety and autism, which mainly started her selective mutism. So, does anyone have anything that may help me navigate this? Thank you. I know of no such instances of autism \"causing\" SM. Selective mutism is\u2014 I guess you could call a defense mechanism developed by children who have a genetic predisposition twords expericing social anxiety, that can extend on into adulthood. Folks with autism have difficulty reading social cues, while SMs typically share a very high degree of emotional intelligence. That is, they are very good at reading social cues. Maybe even a little too good.\n\nI think perhaps the two conditions could coexist on the outer fringes, maybe someone here has experience. But maybe consider picking a different pairing of conditions to give this poor girl. i would say its fine to give her both, you can be autistic and selective mute, i am, and i know lots of people who are I was aware, just not sure of the frequency. The author of the post sounded very flighty anyways. I do not like deleting posts. \n\nBut that is interesting, would you say that autism caused your SM, or, were they simultaneous?\n\nEdit: been reading around r/autism and the experience has been eye-opening. For me, overcoming it has to do with my own lack of motivation to want to. I just no longer have much of any desire, I am just blowing in the wind until the time comes where motivation comes back to me, to want to work on speaking again.\n\nWhen I did want to break-through, I did it and talked to strangers and parents more, but I still hated it.\n\nAnd it is not 'shyness,' it is anxiety and can apply anywhere or not apply anywhere....to any which extent, full or non-existent.\n\nFor me there is really no place it is non-existent, probably because for me it is a self-infliction when I do too much with sometimes talking to myself. I stab myself mentally, and it hurts so I have to just stop.\n\nReading here is the best chance you will have to understand it, I do not think there is any one way to portray it precise or in a way that everyone here will relate exactly to your variant of it, because it varies a lot between each person.\n\nEdit: 19 now, and I have always shown signs of SM in my book, although the breakthrough point was entering middleschool....but I faltered, and here I am today still with it.", "Has anyone been prescribed benzodiazepines for your SM? What was your experience? I am an adult with SM. I have tried almost every drug from the SSRI family there is, but they have little to no effect on my voice. I was thinking about asking my therapist to prescribe me some benzo.\nI would like to hear about the experiences other people with SM had with these meds Unfortunately, meds alone cannot treat SM. They are really only helpful when they are used along with other treatments, such as exposure therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Their primary use is to help support you during exposure therapy. If you merely take the meds and do not do anything else to recover, you will not find them too helpful. \n\nAs far as what meds helped me, I take celexa/citalopram (which is an SSRI) and it helps my social anxiety to some extent. It did not have any effect on my voice/SM though. Only exposure therapy helped my SM for me. Note that meds work completely different for everyone, so just because celexa worked for me does not mean it would work for you too. It was not prescribed specifically for SM, but I have been on a ton of benzos over the years, probably all of them or close to it. As prescribed, I mean, just the doctor trying different things on me while finding the right balance.\n\nIt is better than nothing, I guess. If a given benzo actually works for me (not all of them do) then I am a little less likely to lose my voice, but it is still not a guarantee. \n\nExcept with Xanax. I have never lost my voice while on Xanax, but it is not a good one to start with. Highly addictive when taken regularly and personally I find it makes me just generally feel ill and exhausted. If something else can work for you, avoid Xanax. Not losing your voice sounds dreamy. Sometimes I am ready to give up my memory, alertness, and whatever else just to be normal Eh. I do not lose my voice because I am either unconscious or too sick to care about anything at all.\n\nOther benzos would be preferable if I did not actually need Xanax to achieve anything. So I really do not recommend it unless/until you rule other benzos out. And honestly it is so addictive that I would question the judgement of a doctor that jumps right to it. I am fully recovered as of 5 years and was recently prescribed clonazepam for my generalized anxiety disorder after the failures of SSRIs, SNRI, and a couple of other meds. To my surprise, it seemed to help more with my social anxiety than other aspects of my anxiety. I would assume that if I was put on a benzodiazepine while I still had SM it would have the same sort of impact. The clonazepam definitely has made socializing easier for me, but of course meds work different for everyone and you might not experience the same effects. I do not have it for SM, but I have Valium to take in emergencies. I do not like it, tbh, it makes me feel incredibly out of it even on a tiny dose.\n\nI use it maybe once every few years; the last time was at my mother's funeral. I know just because I am a druggo, but be careful with benzos. They are EXTREMELY addictive and worse than heroin imo. Theyre one of the few drugs with a lethal withdrawal. \n\nWho knows though, they may help you a lot. I have been taking Xanax for about ten years now, after being diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (which caused my SM). It helped, I was able to speak above a whisper, or talk on the phone for the first time in my life. Eventually, I was able to talk normally without it, but sometimes, i will still need it on bad days. My only advice...be very careful with benzos. You can develop a tolerance and it is highly addictive (I am one of the lucky ones, it took a very long time for me to develop tolerance). Do not take it everyday. Try to take it only as needed. I used to only take it once or twice a week and that helped to prevent addiction.", "Does anyone else talk to themselves/think aloud a lot? When nobody else is around, I always talk to myself/think aloud. I think it is because I spend all day not talking, so I feel the need to talk more when I can. I am curious if anyone else does this I can confirm I do this a lot. The more verbal I have gotten in my everyday life, I think the less I do this, but I still do it quite a bit. It never occurred to me that it might be related to SM but it kind of makes sense now that I think about it. i have always has trouble speaking/reading out loud to myself even when i know i am alone. i remember used to \u2018release my pent up words\u2019 by talking nonstop on my mother when she picked me up from school though. damn you just made me self aware lol, my SM stopped when I was about 11 (7 years ago) and i voice my thoughts out loud or cuss when no ones around lol.. needless to say i still rarely speak when out in public I do not do it a lot. Just from frustration and shouting curse words. I can go weeks not talking if I am just home where I live alone too. But it really builds up and I could talk for ages about every little thing when a friend I am comfortable with, is with me. I do this all the time. When I am out walking my dog, I will talk to my dog, when I am grocery shopping with my 6 month old or toddler, I talk to them. I do this. I also like to hum to myself and sing out loud yup I also sing aloud even though i suck at singing. I talk to my dog too. I even talk to my chickens. lol! It is a lot easier for me to talk to animals because I can say the stupidest things and I do not have to worry about what they think of me. They think the world of u. Your pets. Honestly, at this point I think I talk with myself more than anyone else", "Do any of you use ASL to facilitate communication without voice?  Yes. I finally started learning ASL last year and it is been one of the best things I have learned. I live in a community with several people who are deaf and/or have ASD and many of them use ASL and I have been able to communicate more easily than ever in my life.", "Selective mutism held me back in social skills Posting here again because I need to know if I am the only one. I have had SM my whole life (did not talk to distant relatives/adults/other kids until i was like 12) and although I have definitely come a long way, I still feel as though having it for so long at an early age held me back from developing social skills. I still get social anxiety, I feel like I always look awkward when I am talking to others even though I can almost talk normally now. Talking to people is hard, I stutter and mix up words a lot because I am still not used to talking. Thinking about the opportunities that my SM has kept me from makes me so angry. It is stopped me from making friends and meeting new people and it is stopped me from doing things that I have always wanted to do. But above all, it is prevented me from being who I truly am. I hate how you cannot make it by in this world without talking to people, I hate how the world relies on speaking as the number one form of communication. It all just seems so unfair sometimes. You are definitely not alone on that. Mildly stunted social skills is kind of a complication of growing up with SM. I consider myself to have recovered, and I can make conversation with people verbally, but I am extremely awkward and it feels almost forced. It is a struggle. I can relate to you. I have not had it since the 5th grade but afterwards I struggled a lot with my social skills (and still now) and find it difficult to make friends. I never really see anyone talk about it here so I could not tell if I was the only one. I feel extremely awkward making gestures with my hands when I talk, make these weird facial movements if i speak for more than 5 seconds, my face always tenses up, and I cannot maintain eye contact for the life of me. Sometimes I feel really jealous when I see people who have amazing social and speaking skills. Maybe I will get there someday, but for now it is just frustrating I know exactly how you feel. For me my SM manifested in Grade 3 and stayed that way until Grade 11. I could talk to my cousins outside of school who were my only friends, but I did not talk to a single classmate. I missed out on so much, and am still working today at 23 years old to build up my social skills. I understand everything you are saying. I think I started to feel more comfortable (just slightly) in my thirties. I tried everything to feel more comfortable in my twenties. I would \"pre-game\" or whatever before I would go out with my friends. But, SM is different than social anxiety, I think. It involves so much more than feeling awkward, in my case anyway. I stopped trying to fit in anymore. I keep trying to get further into this headspace where anyone' s opinion of me at any given point in time does not matter. It is irrelevant. I know this sounds like me blabbing and blubbering on, but truly, I am the nicest person I know. So what do I care what anyone else thinks of me? I became a nurse and can save anyone's life at anyone's party. I started to look around during weddings and formal parties and think of what I truly felt less than about in the first place. What was I so afraid of? Someone embarrassing me is what it always boiled down to. So I have been on this quest to really love and honor who I am. I have been through some seriously traumatic shit. That is why I became a selective mute. It saved my life at times. It is time to let that go. I do not have to be quiet anymore. I have a voice. \n\nMy sister once told me, \"the most awkward thing about you is that you think you are socially awkward.\" \n\nAnd she is right. Because all of those years, more than 25, I just stayed silent and studied people. I watched their behavior. No one is more socially appropriate than me. We do not have to fill silences to make others feel comfortable. We do not have to be likable for anyone. We need to accept ourselves before we can expect anyone else to. By the time I started getting there, I stopped giving a shit. I am the nicest person I know, and that is all that matters to me. I get you. I have been trying to get a job but I go to interviews and feel like I come off as such a weirdo. Oh my God, I have been trying to get a job for months but I always say minimal replies during the interview and I wish I could say more. I hate it, still have not found a job As what everyone has echoed, we all have this sort of \"challenge\" of underdeveloped social skills. From my experience, I would just tell myself to keep on going, keep making \"mistakes\" here and there and most importantly, be able to learn and get a take away from the \"mistakes\" you have made. I also seem to like to observe people who I think are \"social geniuses\" and emulate social cues that I reckon would fit my personality and also are good traits that keep conversations flowing naturally.\n\nAnother thing I would say also that it is best we do not dwell back on our old past and ruminate about all the lost opportunities in gaining \"Social EXP\" that we have forgone. Instead, focusing on what one can do now that they have got out of their SM shell is what really matters. I have learnt it the hard way and it is only until this year (sort of closing in on my 5th year of being free from SM) that I have realized all those moments I spent making myself feel bad about the lost opportunities were really toxic to my well being and should have been spent more productively in areas where positiveness prevails. (it is been a far cry since this post of mine in the subreddit :  ( )\n\nI keep telling myself, everyone around me sort of has multiples of \"Social EXP\" in relation to mine (20 over years vs my measly 5 years). What matters more is how I try and close that gap, taking lessons from my \"failed\" social experiments and learning fast like an exponential function! Same, it is so depressing. Especially since I desperatly need the money to take care of my other issues.\n\nGuess that is why they say, \"Life's a bitch.\" &gt;   I hate how you cannot make it by in this world without talking to people, I hate how the world relies on speaking as the number one form of communication. It all just seems so unfair sometimes. \n\n  This quote seems so stupid, yet I undestand and a lot of times feel angry because of it.", "Does anyone else have head twitches? It is not all the time but in certain situations I cannot control it and sometimes my head will go in one direction. I have never had anyone mention it (so I assume it is not that prominent), but it is not something I am willingly doing. I think around 7th grade is when it started so idk if it has something to do with nodding my entire life....or some form of PTSD. In 7th grade I was exposed by my friend in private that I watched porn, and then another 'friend'....although I had forgiven him then (although I really did not, I mainly did not want him to come apologizing to my door about what he did since my mom had no clue, and to this day has no clue....and it is not something I want to discuss if it is not necessary)....I have truly forgiven him now (and have reconnected on Xbox, although not a lot), as current me would not care about such things.....but he spread that info around school. And the prior summer to that year, it actually went around with online 'friends'....with my face to it and they made memes out of the situation....instagram's like feature being so open then....without me knowing, fucked me. So it happened twice, and I was never affected by online bullying before, but I did not do anything with porn for a solid 9 months after that online incident. That lack of doing so/whole experience, led to a lot more OCD with contamination; when it comes to sex, I literally do not know how I would mentally go about it because I cannot get over the cleanliness of it. I eventually want a relationship, and it is not that I do not want all that comes with it (as much as I equally do not), it is just I cannot get over the cleanliness of it. Back when, I did not really care about any of that. I was actually kind of gross.\n\nI was just bad with it all back then, and it came back to bite me. I think that is why I am so bad with girls in any capacity nowadays because I have that 'creep' notion in my mind. Back in 6th grade I would sit with probably the most attractive girl in the grade and it was not an issue. Her and her friend who was a boy would always try to get me taking and shit, and it was fine. Past 6th grade, it sucked because I think that notion was around me until the end of school, I also had a Youtube channel started in 9th grade (more than likely permanently quit this year) where there was an inside joke about this girl, within my friend group....**The joke goes:** \\, like \\.......so I carried it to the YouTube channel and it was funny, I used her first name but never her last name. I never meant to be harmful to her personally...but in computer class, I admitted who it was to....I figure a few people; they will keep it to themselves, right? (this is all still 9th grade)....no it goes around the entire school and now I have her friends following me on instagram....one actually confronted me in school and what do I do? Nothing, I just keep walking...I did not say anything. And ofc I get mad online, calling her a 'bitch' and making posts....but I realize now that I should not of done what I did, and I regret that. I do not regret the joke but I regret telling who it was inspired by, because that was never my intent to harm them personally, I figured I could have trusted those I told, but it is not like I ever told them to keep it to themselves (but I never thought to)....and I could talk a few words to the correct people in the correct settings, but I was not saying more than a few words to anyone, more than my friends...I had too much trust in people. In time I ditched that joke, I was already planning to because it was getting old....but that made me, and past that time, I never made it again. Harm was not my goal. Then I realized I DID NOT need that joke to be funny. It all went wrong.\n\nIf a girl comes to me now and is very friendly and upfront with me, I am fine these days. Although I do not talk so there is that, and that is not something that happens a lot......it is all getting better in general, but yeah. That is the last week about......I am getting better looking around in public without being self-conscious about it......BUT, I am still very self-conscious about how I physically look......I do not like my appearance. I do not think I am ugly, I just hate how I look. \n\nAlthough speaking progress is the worst it is been in a few months. I also had dreams last night where I was talking to a lot of different girls I used to know, and other people from my highschool...talking, but my family would appear and I would stop....Talking in dreams is new since the last 3 months....before that it was so rare, I cannot recall it happening. I always used to feel so lonely in dreams....I never liked them, but tonight I did....and those dreams were just casual. I do not like when they are not, as per my contamination OCD. I am trying to keep this post somewhat, not so, graphic. I am trying to be honest with all my thoughts though.\n\nAlso my hands shake in similar situations to the head twitching, which I would assume some others hand's shake. Though sometimes they are still as ever. I used to think it was very odd, I would like to think that hand shaking started around the same time... but I am guessing that is more likely related to the SM than the other....or not, idk.\n\nI also kind of want to try medicine for SM, but at the same time I do not. As I fear I could change in ways current me would be uncomfortable with....and I also do not want to admit to wanting to use it either...idk.\n\nSo that is my mind for now. I do not really see what the point is of all that extra info on your post, so I kind of skimmed. But, to answer your question, I have had those random head twitches quite like you mentioned. I think it is because of anxiety", "Odd Diagnosis Experience... So I am 17, and I was diagnosed relatively recently although I have been mute for as long as I can remember. About 1/2 or 1 year ago I finally got the chance to see a psychologist so that we could determine whether I had mild autism or SM. (These two are often confused) Autism was the main topic of discussion because I had kind of tricked myself into thinking I had it, although SM was always pretty obvious.\nFor reference to how I felt that day: During the test there was a thing with blocks where I had to arrange them so that the patterns matched some pictures. I remember my hands shaking so badly, which is not usual for me.\n***The story actually starts here.\nMy mom is psychologically educated and has taught AP Psychology at a High School for over 15 years. This is relevant. Anyways, after a very anxious 2 hour appointment of me being fully analyzed, the psychologist brought my mom into the room. The psychologist told us that I had Selective Mutism, and I felt a wave of disappointment and relief was over me. (The disappointment being from the fact that it did not explain my personality quirks like I thought an Autism Diagnosis would.) She explained very eloquently what I had been going through my whole life, explaining how my depression was very connected to my SM. I was nearly crying, maybe I was already, I am not sure. So she had explained mostly (I think), saying normal symptoms of SM, etc, and my mom interrupted. She said, \"is not that a choice though?\"\nI literally felt my heart shatter as the psychologist said \"You think it is a choice?\" As her eyes got all big in legitimate surprise. She then explained very thoroughly how it is not a choice, that it is being frozen in such fear that you cannot even lift your tongue or open your mouth. That is when I started crying harder, because my mom, who I thought knew me, seemed to be less aware of how I felt than this stranger who only knew as much about me as my parents had told her and all of the information from my 2hr appointment. I was in the most shock I have ever been in. I felt so betrayed. \nThen. DAYS LATER. My mom and I were walking around the neighborhood, talking, and I mentioned what she had said. Then she was simply like \"Oh, I was testing her.\" In my head I just went *what, the, f*ck.* \nThen I told her how bad that made me feel and she apologized and explained that she just wanted to make sure the psychologist was aware enough of Selective Mutism to explain the 'choice' concept to a 'confused' parent. Never knew my mom could be so manipulative lmao. I am still surprised to this day.\nP.S. Everything worked out and my mom thought it would be obvious that she was testing her. She really did apologize a lot so that is okay \ud83e\udd27\n*Also ask me anything you want about the experience, my life, etc. I will answer as best as I can.", "could not ask to use the restroom When I was in elementary school, I went 2 years of basically never speaking in school. There were a couple of times I peed my pants because I was too scared to ask the teacher to go to the restroom. I am an adult now and I do not have issues with SM much anymore (I mean, I am on the quiet side, but I can usually force myself to talk if I have to). I want to tell my therapist about the restroom issue, but god it is hard. Anyone else? If so, have you told anyone? Same exact thing happened to me in 3rd grade, i was afraid my teacher would say no so i didnt ask I have no advice but my daughter is going through this so any advice on helping her use the bathroom would be appreciated. I was like this throughout kindergarten, I signaled by putting my hands over my lower stomach and fortunately the teacher learned to understand this gesture. Later in primary school I spoke more but having a to interrupt the teacher to ask the question was terrifying so I made sure to go to the toilet during breaks I used to have the same thing when I was younger! Definitely would recommend telling your therapist about it, even if it is not a problem anymore.\n\nI remember I went on a overnight school trip (I know, I thought field trips were required back then) and had to go to sleep. I had to pee so badly and waited for everyone to fall asleep so I could use the bathroom, but my teacher saw how I was still awake and said if I needed to go, all I did was nod lol. \n\nDo not worry, your not alone in this problem! I also would not ask to go to the bathroom the whole time I was in school. Fortunately that never happened to me, probably in part because I also would not ask for water I had this problem too, even in high school. My therapist suggested I write down \u201cCan I go to the bathroom?\u201d and hand it to the teacher whenever he/she passed by. \nI also try to use the bathroom before class even if I do not feel like I have to haha I thought this was just me, I was that one kid who peed herself every other day from kindergarten to first grade When I was a little kid I peed myself in school a lot and it was very embarrassing. The most scarring time was when I was in gym class and the coach got mad at me, not sure why, and she made me go to the corner to do exercise as punishment. I really needed to pee but I could not gather the courage to speak so I peed myself in that corner :( If she does not already, it might be nice to have some arrangement with the teacher where she can go without asking or has some other signal", "What jobs are viable for someone with sm? Looking for anything that would work as a career choice or option for someone with sm a list can work,\nThank you in advance Anything where you are able to work from home is my suggestion for an adult. For a teenager the back of a store, away from people works. Maybe somewhere that is always very noisy (eg. a train station). Some people find that less anxiety inducing than working somewhere that is dead quiet (a library), interestingly. Also some ppl do not have a problem babysitting or working with children.\n\nAs a specific example, one adult SMer went from job to job for years trying to support her family and ultimately ended up using her baking skills to start a home cooking biz at &gt;40 yo. Others have found online work, writing, coding, creating...\n\nfor a younger person I personally think it would be better to work outside with a little interaction with others just to try and learn from life challenges. It would be worth it in the long run, although it greatly depends on the person's mindset and where they are at. It may not be worth it if it causes extreme stress.\n\nYou would be surprised where people end up working. I know an adult smer who works at starbucks. It is hard, of course, but SMers face many hardships.\n\nThis question has been asked many times in this community. You should search it up to read the other threads. Take a look at the important documents section of the pinned post. There is a nice document there that can help you mentally prepare yourself to explain SM in writing if necessary. It can sometimes be helpful to be up front about it rather than take the stress of being \"found out\" one day. It worked for one teen I knew. Thank you, I will look into some resources Whatever they want. Do not limit yourself. What are you passionate about? I am actually asking for a friend, and I hate to say it but they do not really have a passion for anything in particular, I want to help cheer them up in anyway possible and understand them better. Everyone enjoys something. But, that said, SMs tend to have high emotional intelligence, so a job were they can put that to good use and feel like they are making a difference might be a good fit for your friend. Maybe something like a paraprofessional, or, someone who works with animals. Not all of these roles require some kind of advanced degree, you can brainstorm with your friend to find out what they are naturally good at and enjoy doing.", "Is there a correlation between selective mutism and dissociative panick attacks? What would cause panic screams like this in a child\n\n\n\nMy parents are emotionally abusive and have been somewhat physically abusive but idt this is related.\n\nI have memories of myself as a child at home or out in public with my family, just standing and than my mouth would open wide and my eyes would stare straight ahead and is just a scream \u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d for probably like ten minutes straight with no pauses. It was like I was not even there and just screaming while standing completely still and looking ahead of me. I feel like when this would happen my parents would react by throwing me in the backyard or manhandling me. I have random memories of my mom jabbing me with a marker repeatedly and tackling me and than lightly banging my head into the floor repeatedly plus she would rip off my clothes while I wore them- but this was when I was not doing anything and was standing there calm- so the screaming issue was not caused by that. I do have adhd-pi, had selective mutism as a little kid, and probably some anxiety Poeple in this sub cannot help you in any official capacity, but that does not sound like an SM thing on its own. Although both anxiety and abuse can lead to panic attacks. Do you think the things I wrote about my mom would be seen as abusive and traumatizing to a normal child? Or could the selective mutism made me more sensitive to it? i do not think SM on its own would make someone more sensitive to any kind of mistreatment, but either way what you went through was absolutely incredibly abusive- both physically and mentally- and i am genuinely so sorry. the screaming does not sound related to SM, more a kind of panic attack, but either way. please hang in there and take care, DMs are always open if you want", "Can you develop SM throughout your life? My question is exactly as above, and I hope it is an ok question to ask here.\n\nIt has never ever crossed my mind that I had selective mutism as a kid, despite being shy and not wanting to talk, I did talk when forced to.\n\nRecently however, when being asked to talk, I have been experiencing physical symptoms such as vision blurring with light-spots (not sure what to call them, but like when you look at sunlight too long and then look away and you get all those swirly-patterns), throat aching, anxiety, and being unable to say things how I think them in my head.\n\nThis is a new level of anxiety on top of the anxiety disorder I am diagnosed with, and have been living with since about age five.\n\nSo, can someone develop selective mutism as an adult? Most of the official information I am able to find on the internet talks about childhood selective mutism, and people growing out of it when they get into their teens.\n\nAlso, if it sounds like I do not have a possibility of SM, please tell me! I have not been able to find out much to help me, or to find out what is wrong, and ironically I do not feel comfortable talking to anyone about it in real life, for fear of judgement. I am wondering this too, I have always had a level of SM but it has NEVER been as bad as it is now, it is so frustrating, especially since my mom thinks I am faking it and being dramatic. Even though I have been diagnosed and both my parents has been to classes about autism, although I do not really know what they talked about there.\n\nI have some theories as to why this is, but I am obviously not a professional at all lol. One is that maybe it has something to do with respecting my body\u2019s limits? I used to be absolutely miserable when I was forced into speaking and other things I was not comfortable in, but know that I do not push myself too hard I am feeling so much better mentally.\n\nBut yeah I am wondering the same thing Yeah! I feel for you when you say people think your being dramatic or faking it. That is what I am worried about. I just want to _know_ because once I had my other diagnosis it was so much easier for people around me to accept and to get help.\n\nI am sad that Google and even the NHS website which is usually very informative has such little information on selective mutism and it in adults and how it develops.\n\nHopefully someone in this sub can answer this question, or has a good website that explains selective mutism in more detail so I can either dismiss the idea or be confident in asking for help.\n\nSame goes to you. Good luck with everything, I hope you manage to get your SM back down and more capable :) Trigger warning: Death, hospitals\n\nHi. It has taken me a couple days to work up the courage to post this, so sorry about that.\n\nI am 28, turning 29 in November. I developed SM in 2019 after experiencing a 2nd traumatic event that also led to complex PTSD.\n\nI watched my mom bleed out in the hospital and almost die after a botched breast cancer surgery. That was around 2009.\n\nThen I watched my dad pass away in the hospital after his battle with leukemia. He was in really bad shape.\n\nBoth of these events together led to CPTSD, severe anxiety, chronic depression, and eventually selective mutism. \n\nIt is definitely possible to develop it later in life. Whether or not you have to experience something traumatic or not I am not sure. But I have completely withdrawn and now rely on my mother to do any sort of communicating for me. She has to come with me to doctor appointments, shop in stores, etc. I can only talk to her, my sister, and 1 very close friend. I completely lock up and shut down when anyone else tries to talk to me.", "\"Understand\" by Christian Blevins - A Social Anxiety Song ", "What it depends on where and who is/are people or situations that who and where can talk with? And can you select the situations and people who and where you can talk or it is not your choose?", "Ask me anything: I had mutism for 7 years, now I give public speeches When I was 10 years old, I became completely unable to speak to anyone. This was for psychological reasons, and continued for seven years. Five years on, I am 22 and I give weekly public speeches at my university.\n\nAsk me anything. how did you do it? how did you do it? What do you figure helped the most? What therapy did you undertake? Also well done!! Big question. I will give an outline and people can ask for more specific details if they want.\n\nWhen I was 13, I decided to accept help from my parents. I am from the UK, so they took me to the NHS's (the free healthcare organisation in the UK) mental health counseling service for children and adolescents. After three years of counseling, zero progress was made. So my parents decided to pay for a private clinical psychologist. This psychologist was truly a genius, and together we found a way to overcome my problem. This process took approximately one year.\n\nOvercoming mutism only created new problems. I was socially incompetent, I had no idea how to express my personality, and I had no idea how to use my voice. Gradually, I forced myself into social situations and built my confidence. After two years of this, I was semi-competent in conversation and decided to take a big risk. In 2016, I flew to Cambodia and spent three months volunteering as an English teacher in a primary school (children aged 3-16). This was my first exposure to public speaking. In truth, I deliberately structured my lessons in a way to avoid speaking in front of everyone too much. Nevertheless, I gained some confidence.\n\nThat same year, I began my undergraduate degree. At the start of term, I immediately joined the public speaking society. I only went twice and ran away from it. Later that year, I entered a public speaking competition, forgot all my lines and made myself look a fool in front of hundreds of people. In my second and third year at university, I made further attempts to engage in public speaking, but kept running away from it. Now I am half way through my final year at university, and I have committed myself to giving a speech every week, no matter how I feel. This has been going very well, and I am proud to say I feel like a high quality public speaker, and I feel like I have finally conquered mutism. I now enjoy giving public speeches and I cannot wait to give my next one. I went through maybe 10 different psychologists before someone figured out what to do with me. So I tried so many therapies, I cannot remember them all. However, what I do remember is what did work.\n\nTo sum it up: very very gradual desensitisation.\n\nBear in mind the following process took a year.\n\nFirst I got used to whispering to myself alone. I read from one page in a book over and over. Gradually I raised the volume of my voice, until I could handle a regular speaking voice. I could not do any of this until I was convinced our area of his office floor was completely vacated, bug free, and that my psychologist was all the way in the carpark. I was like some kind of paranoid fugitive.\n\nThe next step was to position the psychologist down the hallway with the office door closed. I whispered aloud from the book. Every so often (maybe every five minutes), the psychologist would inform me he is moved a step closer. He could not hear me even when he was stood outside the door anyway. This process continued over and over again, and I gradually raised the volume of my voice. Eventually, he was able to hear me and it became too much for me, so we changed strategy. What we were obviously missing was the game of Monopoly.\n\nThe psychologist made me do some simple breathing exercises to calm down. We played Monopoly, and the psychologist encouraged me to hum and make noises as I moved my counter along the board. He gave me a recording device, asked me to record myself saying things like \"Pass go, collect \u00a3200\", \"rent please\", \"go to jail\", and then left the room for awhile. I made these recordings, and we continued with the game. The idea was for me to play these recordings at the relevant moments. I think the point was to get me used to the idea of someone hearing my voice, without the stress of having to actively use my voice. We did this for awhile, and then I was encouraged to try and very quietly make vowel sounds while moving my counter. Suppose I rolled a five on the dice, then I would softly whisper \"ah\" five times -- once for each square my counter moved across. Then we deconstructed the word \"one\" into components like \"woh\" and \"n\", and I would try softly (almost inaudibly) whispering these components as I moved my piece around the board.\n\nIn the next session, we combined the components together, so that I was almost inaudibly whispering the word \"one\", while moving my counter from square to square. Gradually my speech became audible to the psychologist, and I was aware of this without being too overwhelmed.\n\nWe did some more of the hallway stuff I mentioned earlier. He was positioned down the hall, the office door was closed, and I was reading a page of his book. This time the goal was for me to stop whispering and start talking. So gradually I built up to that, until my psychologist could hear a murmur. He was aware I was talking (and not just whispering anymore), but no individual words were comprehensible. I was okay with that at this point. Now we opened the office door, and the psychologist gradually advanced up the hallway. I think he made it to around a metre away from the door before that was too overwhelming. He could hear what I was saying fairly clearly at that point.\n\nIn another session, we repeated this hallway experiment again. He advanced up the hallway, and made it all the way into the room with me, and sat down on a chair in front of me. I hesitated, but summoned the strength to continue reading aloud. Now this was a big breakthrough. I was actually talking with someone in a room with me. I had not done this for six years. I could not give him any eye contact, and I could not respond verbally to anything he asked me though.\n\nTo solve this problem, the psychologist went to the carpark and telephoned me. He asked me simple questions, requiring only yes/no answers. There would be a long pause, and then eventually I would whisper back an answer. Yes/no answers turned into two word answers, and then three word answers, etc. Then whispering turned into quiet speaking. This was my first verbal conversation (albeit a very basic one) in 6 years. However, it still took as long as a minute for me to answer a question. The psychologist returned to the office.\n\nNow we started throwing a ball at each other. The goal was to just say a random word as soon as we caught the ball. This eventually turned into asking a question, throwing the ball, and then once the other person had caught the ball, they had to answer the question straight away. Eventually it felt natural to stop using the ball, and I was no longer taking a painfully long time to respond.\n\nNow that I could respond verbally, the psychologist began asking me to visualise the anxiety and describe it aloud. I think I described it as some kind of demonic figure, standing guard over my larynx, tying it up with chains and ropes. Now I believe the psychologist used a technique called \"eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing\" while I was doing this. This meant my eyes were closed and he was tapping the backs of my hands rapidly from left to right. It was pretty freaky, it made my head feel like it was going to explode. I was encouraged to visualise the demon figure, and imagine it slowly phasing from a solid and into a vapour, allowing it to evaporate into nothing. Tackling the chains and ropes involved visualising them being loosened and merged into a ball. I was asked to imagine the ball steadily inflating, larger and larger, to the size of the universe. Then.... Pop!\n\nDuring our next session, we just talked and talked. He took me out for a coffee in a busy cafe and we talked. I realised I did not care all too much that other people could hear me. They knew nothing about me, they had no expectations and they were not surprised by me speaking. In fact, they did not even care. So now I realised I could speak to strangers. However, I could not speak to anyone that knew I had a problem with speaking, which meant I could not speak to my friends and family.\n\nNevertheless, this was enough to experiment with. I started sixth form (the stage in education two years before university), attending one far from where I lived, so that there would not be many people there that knew me. This meant leaving lots of friends behind, but it was a necessary sacrifice. Without having socialized properly in half my life, I was socially retarded to be quite honest. Despite this, I did not lose hope and I persevered.\n\nSome months later, I returned to the psychologist with my dad. The goal was for me to try and speak to him. The whole process took six hours. We experimented with the various approaches previously mentioned, but then had a new idea, inspired by the King's Speech. Here is the setup. We positioned my dad down the hallway. I wore headphones, with loud music playing. Then I began quietly whispering aloud from a book. Dad gradually came closer, I gradually became louder, and the music gradually became quieter. Hence, I gradually became aware that I was talking and my dad was listening close by. Eventually my dad was sat next to me, the music was off and I was speaking at full volume. I had not spoken in front of my dad in 6.5 years. Now we emulated a conversation, by reading one sentence each in alternating fashion. We read a few pages like this, then ditched the book. Dad asked me some simple questions, and I asked him some. The questions grew in sophistication, and eventually we were conversing quite normally. My dad always joked that if I ever speak again, it is okay for me to swear at him. That day we walked around town swearing loudly, without a care in the world.\n\nNow we would developed a winning formula. This idea of lowering the volume of initially loud music, while increasing the volume of my initially quiet voice. A few months later, I returned to the psychologist with my sister, mum and her boyfriend. We tried this formula out, and two hours later I could speak to all of them. This would be the last time I met the psychologist. He explained to my mum how the formula works.\n\nThat summer, we went from family member to family member, from friend to friend, and one by one, we we applied the formula, until there was not a person left in the world I could not speak to. In the summer of 2014, I was finally free of my mutism, after seven years of battling with it. Although, I was still a long way from where I wanted to be. That psychologist sounds awesome... glad he was able to assist you in such a big way :) He really is awesome. He is called Dr Stephen Briers. I later found out he is written a few best selling books, had a few TV shows, has starred on major radio chat shows and has a Wikipedia page. I had no idea he was such a big shot psychologist at the time! :) If it is not too personal, what was the initial trigger of the condition? Thanks for sharing your story man. It is really inspiring. And I hope you have a wonderful life ahead of you. : ) Firstly, a turbulent family life instilled a lot of anxiety within me, which I think made me vulnerable to developing more complex anxiety disorders.\n\nThe mutism developed in two stages. In stage one, it was my birthday and I had two friends sleeping over. It was around 1am, and my friends were being noisy. I knew my parents were trying to sleep, and I did not want to disturb them, so I tried very hard to make my friends be quiet and go to sleep. At some point, my dad came into the room and told me to stop showing off in front of my friends, as he assumed it was me making all of the noise. That really pissed me off. Consequently, I was unable to speak to my dad.\n\nA couple months go by, and then we reach stage two. For a few years prior to this, I liked to wear a hooded jumper all the time, to hide my hair. For some reason it made me feel protected and less anxious. However, this meant that my hair became long and unkempt. So inversely, I felt embarrassed, angry and anxious if anyone saw my hair. At a big family meal in a restaurant, someone decided to pull down my hood, revealing my hair. Retrospectively this seems insignificant, but at the time my entire world fell apart. It was incredibly traumatic and through embarrassment, anger and anxiety, I lashed out aggressively and got dragged out of the restaurant. The next day, I was completely unable to speak at all. Hey, I am glad to hear it, I created this post with the hope of inspiring someone. All the best to you, take care. :) This really puts a smile on my face. Thanks and all the best to you as well. How do you learn to express personality? What are good ways to force yourself into social situations as a university student? How do you learn to express personality? Firstly, let me say you can achieve a lot by being expressive with body language. Take a look at the magician called Teller.\n\nThat said, I suppose the point of this question is to understand how to do it verbally. For me, it was about repeated exposure to verbal communication. While doing this, I experimented with different ways of expressing myself. To see what I mean, just look at other people. They talk in different ways, use body language in different ways, they prefer to talk about particular topics, some people are comical, some are lazy, some people are introverted, and so on. I would follow up experimentation with introspection, to get a sense of whether I liked that way of expressing myself. Although, early on I wasted a lot of time worrying about what other people thought. Once I let go of that worry, my progress accelerated. Engaging with public speaking accelerated progress even more. Doggedly work at it and do not give up, no matter how uncomfortable it gets. Three to four years after overcoming mutism, I think I finally figured it out.\n\nIt was not until I got to university that I began making progress rapidly. Before then, I was just focusing on holding a conversation, which took about two years. Once that is more or less working, you can move onto showing off your personality and becoming a really interesting person to talk to, in the fashion I described above. That took another one or two years.\n\nAt university, you have endless social events to experiment at. Parties, balls, meet ups, gaming nights, movie nights, etc. You may find yourself living with people you do not know, and then you have to spend time getting to know them. There is a plethora of societies you can join. Societies are full of people interested in a particular thing, so you know what to expect. The public speaking society has been my pride and joy. I ended up becoming the president of one society, which meant it was in my job description to be involved in situations where I had to talk a lot. You can seek out one off events, like the public speaking competition I mentioned. You could get involved in something where you have to communicate with a team (e.g. 180 Degrees Consulting). Before and after a lecture, you can make conversation with the person next to you. During lectures, you can ask questions and answer questions if the professor asks them. Frankly, you can try and strike up a conversation anywhere and with anyone. It feels risky, but just try it. At some point I got Tinder, and went on loads of dates. That certainly tested my social skills out and made me evaluate how I want to convey myself in an authentic and lovable way (eventually I worked it out and now I have a girlfriend).\n\nSomewhere in amongst all of this, various things made me miserable. But I just go back to introspection and understand why. I just see it as a good sign I am figuring out my limitations, and that I am seeking out discomfort and challenging myself. That sort of stuff builds character after all.\n\nFinally, I recommend Dale Carnegie's book 'The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking', which expands on the ideas I have expressed. Also his 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' book is good further reading.", "How to make phone calls with SM? Hey, my schools mental health services department only list a phone number.

You can see where I am going with this.\n\nI have never gotten help for SM before (first time I tried I was kind of bullied for it and this is my first time since then) so I cant understand all the abbreviations and definitions in the resource post.\n\nTl;dr how the hell do I make a phone call to a non emergency service Maybe write a script you will read from, rehearse it and when you make the call, just read from what you wrote. It will help if you tend to freeze and go blank. Its one of the first things I was taught in therapy for SM. It is worth a shot :) Thank you! What do I do if they start asking questions though? Do I think of any and put them in the script? What should I do if they ask me something unexpected? Writing a script as the other person suggested is great advice. You could also rehearse the convo in your head a couple times with different things the person you are calling might say. And just practice with what your answers would be. Practice a few times and it becomes more natural. You can practice in your head or out loud. Then you can jot anything else important down on your script in bullet points so you can look at them if you need to Thank you so much for the advice man Phone calls are awful. I do the script trick and it helps a lot. If I have to call someone for an appointment then I usually write down two or three dates and also a suggestion for a time of day. If there is an unexpected question I sometimes repeat the question or I frankly say \u201eI do not understand\u201c. Definitely try to write down any questions and answers you can think of them asking. Have some information available that they may need also, so you can read it off Aah thank you! I really needed to know what to do if something unexpected came up too! Thank you so much Scripts are amazing, bullet points for everything you need to mention, having a pen and paper ready when you make the call in case rhey give you info, and something you can fidget with just one hand (I usually have my squishmallows toy) or when I really really can not function: figure out how mute people do it (can I text that number instead of calling?) or making someone else do it for me (my mom tried to arrange my first therapy appointment, but they needed to talk to me directly and they ended up calling me, which is easier for me to handle than me having to call them).

I live with my dad but I never talk to him. I ignore my mom and never talk to her. (Mom lives kind of  close by). Basically my family is awful and I get no attention or love but I am used to it and I just try not think about it. As long as I do not Think about it, it is fine. \n\nI can speak to my sister or my friends fine mostly. But there is still sometimes where I know what I want to say but I cannot say anything.  When I am around my dad it is the worse I stutter and can barely talks ( very stressful to be around I avoid it as much as possible). Just imagine the worst parent you could possibly have without them beating you physically or refusing to feed you. But everything else. \n\nI cannot talk when I am talking on the phone or at fast food places. Or basically anywhere now. I sometimes can but other times I know what I want to say but I just cannot. So I do not even try. I am just always anxious and cannot stop thinking and I know I should not be anxious but that does not help. \n\nMy ability to speak has gotten so much worse as I have got older Bc I am smarter and a lot more anxious and a lot more overthinking. I am an extrovert inside but not being able to speak I basically just act like an introvert. Not many know I cannot speak or feel like this tho. I am just not sure if I should get medicine or try to  get a therapist or something. When I am drunk I have 0 anxiety and can talk fine or when I am alone and when I am singing even if I am signing in public. \n\nI play basketball and used to run track and do not have any other problems than I think just really bad undiagnosed anxiety/ social anxiety. And depression. You should definitely seek professional help. You can also try to attend a local support group, if not too anxiety-inducing. When you are drunk, you are not yourself... that explains why it is easier for you to talk to others and be more social. Selective mutism varies in many ways for everyone, and it does not always seem to make sense to you, but it may very well be a part of it. Try to find a professional who has experience with anxiety (and specifically SM). Ok thank you, will do. \ud83d\ude4f", "I want to fucking cry. I do not know what to do Hello everyone, I am using a new account because I am really fucking ashamed of this. I have lied about my \u2018social life\u2019 everywhere I go in both real life and online. \n\nI am a male 16 year old internationally born US resident. Yesterday, I stumbled across  and after reading it, I wanted to cry. Like holy fucking shit, it hit me so hard right in my feelings. Every symptom for selective mutism, from eye contact when talking, to inner thoughts, matched up to my undiagnosed \u2018symptoms.\u2019\n\nYes, I am self-diagnosed, but now thinking back, I wish I was diagnosed a long time ago. I also believe I have PTSD from continuous physical and verbal abuse from a middle-aged man (who was not in my family) when I was in kindergarten. If I knew i had selective mutism earlier, I would have started improving myself way earlier. Beginning of 2018 was when I first started to self-recover from undiagnosed SM because that was when I realized there was something wrong me\u2014yea it was when my friends had given up on me. I did not want to be different, and I tried really hard for that. I am already improving, but I do not know if I can ever be *normal*\n\nI remember in kindergarten when other adults telling my parents about how quiet and obedient I am. My parents did not think I had any problems, and I think they still do not know. They think I am socializing at school. They think me chatting on Reddit is me talking to my irl friends. Oh my god if only they knew.\n\nI remember in first grade when i was put on a sports team, and my peers were talking about pop culture and toys, while I was too poor to be able to enjoy the luxuries they talk about. I remember that I blamed my parents in my thoughts for not buying me things, for not giving me toys for me to be able to have something to talk about with my peers.\n\nLater, my family and I moved to America. Here, at around age 9, I developed (self-diagnosed) severe depression from isolation. I do not think my parents knew. I attempted suicide three times, and survived. No one in my life but me knows about this. I am so fucking ashamed of it. Also, I just realized the only \u2018friends\u2019 I have made at my first 4 elementary schools are probably autistic, as they were all outcasts with unique symptoms of autism (that I just realized\u2014I have only wanted friends; I did not care whom). The fact that I transferred 5 times in elementary school probably did not help me either.\n\nAt a new elementary school, my teacher wanted my parents to have me test, because she thought I was too smart for school. Honestly I did not think so, I was just *different* . I did pass the test though and joined the talented education system. However, even with the other \u2018talented\u2019 students, I never talked. These kids were nice though. They helped me enroll in all of these cool different programs, like band, that I still participate in to this day. They welcomed me even though I never talked. A simple \u201cthank you\u201d is what I want to say to them right now but as usual, I am too fucking ashamed to do that. \n\nIn high school, I only talked when answering questions and giving presentations. I loved presentations however, as it forced me to talk\u2014 which I could not/cannot do in normal everyday conversations. I ran for student government president, because I wanted to prove everyone, including myself, that I *can* talk\u2014people were always amazed when I open my mouth, as I was/am the quiet kid.\n\nMy friends (I guess not really anymore) tried really hard to welcome and include me into their friend group. I always fucking chickened out even though I sincerely wanted to feel included. Now, they have given up and do not anymore.\n\nI remember I was photo shy. Although I am not ugly (pretty good looking even), I avoided group photos because... I do not even know why actually.\n\nI looked at my mirror trying to talk, only to find out I look weird when I talk\u2014I do not really even move my lips when I talk. Right now, I am trying to make myself talk on discord, but that is not really helping, as I do not talk in the voice chats, and instead, I listen and type.\n\nNow I am in college. College gives me a chance to start over, to self-improve without shame. And I love college for that. I tried to talk as much as possible, to force myself to talk. As a result, I went to clubs, ran for officer positions, and got some of them. I still cannot talk normally though. I wish I knew how. Just three months ago, I thought I had ADHD because you know, I am different, so I took the ADHD test anonymously at my college. The result came back negative: I did not have ADHD.  I thought I had something else. Honestly I am almost certain I have selective mutism, and I will talk to my doctor about this next checkup (which is in about a year)\n\nDo you guys know if I will ever be able to talk normally and hold a conversation? I am so fucking boring in life, and I want to change that. When my parents ask me a question or talk to me, I do not reply even though I can. It has become second nature to me, to ignore people. I want to change that. Oh my god I want to cry now again\n\nSorry for the rant, and thanks if you have read this far. Good luck you guys as well, hopefully you guys can reach your goals of talking in life better than I can. Thank you\n Friend, I know that you will be able to hold a conversation and get over this. It takes time but it is more than possible... even without medication.\n\nI am your age. I had selective mutism as a kid.. from the age of about 13 or 14 onwards it turned into extreme shyness and social anxiety. And very slowly it is been getting better. Little by little. My social skills are near non existent and sometimes I might come across as rude or uninterested when I am speaking to someone.. but in reality it is just because I do not know what to say. It is odd.. ever since my selective mutism turned into this \u201cforced shyness\u201d and social anxiety, it is like my mind will not think of things to say even though I know I could say them. But at least I can speak, at least I can try. I cannot have a *great* conversation but I can have a conversation \n\nAnd I know that I will get better.\n\nAs for you, try to get counselling, it is a way that I found helped me get used to speaking to someone. And also helped to get things off my chest.. maybe your school has a school counsellor? If not, that is ok\n\nStay positive. Believe that you will get better and accept yourself. I know that it is so so hard to do. But before you try to fix yourself you have got to be loving to how you are now. You have probably got extra pressure on you because of gender stereotypes. You are a teenage boy.. I get away with being a quiet girl, but I do not know how people would see me if I was a boy. I am happy that you have been strong \n\nSo yeah, I hope this helps, or that at least it makes sense. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk about anything  You will definitely be able to hold a conversation and talk. I do not know all the answers, as I am still struggling to talk, but I found it is kind of like a mind game for me. Like with the presentations and forcing you to talk. I do not know how to explain it or put it in the rights words. You have possibly found some root causes, so maybe focus on those one at a time to come to terms and deal with the emotions. I get emotionally overwhelmed when I try to talk and almost cry so I just do not. But to overcome it I know I am going to have to cry infront of people.\nI think you should try to find what is holding you back and take hold of it. Your mind can be stronger than your body. I feel my body shuts down even when I want to talk but cannot. Except, recently I have taken control of my body with my mind. I do not let it take control and shut down. It is hard and can take a while and I still fail, but I have gotten so much better. I do not let it take control. I take the control and it is working slowly. \nGood luck to yourself.\n I feel bad for you, I was the same, you know you are different but do not want to believe it... I learned for myself, that using my anxiety and fear helps in improving myself. It became a habit of mine, that I actually enjoy presenting stuff to others (My class for example). I am getting very nervous before it, but the kick I experience after getting these situations over me keeps me going.\n\nI had a lot of Self esteem improving therapy, which helped a lot. Perhaps that will help you?\n\nThe thing is, I have been diagnosed with mutism since I am 4\\~ Years old and been in therapy for a long time. I managed to \"get over it\" without medication, but perhaps that could help you?\n\nThe key component here is time, practice and motivation to get better!", "For the gamers on here  Love this! I do not play destiny so I wish there was something like this that included all other games \\+1 me too. Hello all, sorry that the post was only destiny related. After seeing this, I feel like maybe a broader game criteria should be in the works. This is nice, but I prefer single player games. That last time I went online some jerk messed with me for no reason and that was it.", "I give up. Having selective mutism is really hard and no one can help me. I am always the problem and the thing that is preventing me from talking to people but it is never other people's fault or our society for preventing progress. Selective mutism is a hard fact of life. You will grow up and you will not be able to talk to people. People will be disinterested in talking to you and will view you as rude for not talking. You will have no friends and you will just be lonely all the time. What is the point of living when you have selective mutism? Find something you are passionate about! It is really about going within to find out what YOU want to get out of life. It is not up to anyone else but you. People see your exterior self but they have no idea what lies within. You must find what makes you excited and inspired in life. It does not matter what anyone else thinks of it. As long as you are doing what makes you happy, do not worry what others think. They are all caught up in themselves. What they see on the surface is not all there is to you. You need to practice accepting yourself for who you are. There is only one of YOU! Embrace your uniqueness! So many people are too scared to and feel threatened by others doing it. So go your own way in life. You cannot say the right thing to the wrong person. And you cannot say the wrong thing to the right person. \nYour people are out there. But you must learn and discover things about yourself before you can share it with others. You are important and you will find your place in this world. Do not rush. Accept where you are now and try to learn from it. There is no use in thinking about how things could be different. Make use of your current situation. There is always something to learn, no matter how deep you must dig to figure it out. \nTake care, wishing you love and light \ud83d\udc95 1. What Plantsfood said\n2. You can do it. You can grow. It is hard. But it is manageable. Do little babysteps towards the goal. Try to get confidence in yourself. Get help if needed. I managed to overcome my mutism, if I were able to do it, you sure can too. But giving up? Sorry, but that is not a viable option.  \nGet professional help if you need, it helped me. My mother put me in therapy with four years old.   \nAlso try to get out of your comfort zone, little by little. No one expects all changes to happen over night. They need a lot of work to form.\n3. Selective Mutism may be a Problem, but I see it as an opportunity, an opportunity to grow. An opportunity to jump over your shadow.\n4. Even if you have problems overcoming it, be honest with yourself. Be the protagonist of your own story. Selective Mutism does not mean that you never talk again, only that you have problems in certain areas of life. You can still find friends, you can still find love. All that helped me a lot.\n\nDo not give up. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me. I can give advice and I can listen to your problems. No judgement You are looking at it the wrong way. Yes sm is debilitating. But it does not have to last forever. I had a lot of therapy and finally beat it by doing role play. It was hard but it worked. Hang in there. It is hard and I still do suffer from it, although it is a bit better now I still am terrible talking to strangers and have never had much luck making lasting friends. Many people think I am rude or do not like them because I do not talk to them. Because I do not initiate conversations or keep them going people stop trying to talk to me. It can feel lonely or hopeless. There is that fear of being forever alone. It can can better though, you can improve and form connections. It takes time and practice but it is possible. CBT, exposure therapy, and acceptance can help. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat. I am sorry you are feeling so hopeless and alone. I have been there and still struggle sometimes Your point of view is really heartbreaking! It also does not have to be that way! If you are still in school, you can have protection through a 504 or an IEP. If you are not, there are therapist out there who are familiar with SM, or willing g to learn. ( teaches others about it for free.\n\nYou can overcome SM and once you do- your story will inspire so many silent 5 year old little girls (along with many, many more people!) I am in this (\n that is for parents trying to help their kids with Selective Mutism. These parents range from scared shitless to experts that can tell the ( a thing or two. You may want to check it out...\n\nSelective Mutism is a voice stealing beast. I hate it with a passion! Last year, I accused it of stealing my daughter's childhood. But, that does not have to be the case! You can share information written by professionals virtually, and train others how to treat you. Protect your silence, until you start exposure therapy. Than, update them, in whatever capacity you feel comfortable with. If you need, let those articles educate your own parents. \n\nI listened to a podcast last year that featured a girl who used to have SM, the interviewers were stunned by her. There is also a new podcast called ( that goes over everything SM related. \n\nHopefully one of these links helps give you some hope. Please do not give up! There are many people out there who cannot speak at all due to an illness or disability and still thrive. Talking is not the only form of communication out there. Personally, I am a very expressive person, so even if I am not speaking, you can tell what I am thinking. I also write things down if I feel the need to. What is important is to let your personality and passions show, and people will like you for who you are.\n\nThere are also some online stores where you can buy shirts, buttons, stickers, etc. that can let people know you have SM. I gathered some links below:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n( as hard as it gets we all feel that way from time to time. but you have to fight it show it that you are so much more than it and you will keep fighting. fight back dont give up dont let it win the war to your voice.", "Could i have selective mutism? So basically, I have social anxiety and i do not talk very much. I always respond whenever someone directly asks me a question, but usually just very short answers and with some stuttering, (yeah, no, i do not know, i am fine etc).\n\nThe problem is whenever i am in a situation where i have to say something first. I get super anxious to the point where i cannot talk at all. even simple things like asking how someone is day was, or asking to borrow a pen, or telling someone about a small thing that happened that day.\n\nThis other day i was working on a group project. I was sitting next to a group member. I ran into a small problem that i would have to ask for help with (which would take like 10 sec). I could not continue work without fixing the problem, so i just sat in silence doing nothing for the rest of the class.\n\ndo you guys think this is selective mutism, or just regular social anxiety? The line is blurry and behaviors overlap.\n\n Ask yourself: is the diagnosis important to you? \nWhat would change if you have/do not have SM? \n\nI like to view behavior and thought patterns in dependant of diagnosis. \n\nTo isolate them and then work on each dysfunctional behavior respectively. \n\nImprovement. \nThat is what we all want in the end, right? You would likely met the diagnostic criteria  If you physically cannot talk, then it is probably SM. If you can, but are too scared to, probably not. What a coincidence, I was literally thinking about making a post about the same thing earlier today.  I can answer questions and speak when someone speaks to me first, but I can almost never say something on my own. I have had this similar problem in so many classes I have sat there doing nothing because i cannot ask a teacher or someone for help sometimes the teachers would realise I had not done anything and get mad at me which made me feel even worse about myself.", "Watching Old Home Videos With Christmas coming up, I have been watching all sorts of old home movies. There are no signs of me being anxious or shy at home. I am actually the opposite. I was so happy and I was a cute kid (not to be cocky). I do not get it, what triggered me to shut down at school? Even at large Italian family events I was perfectly fine. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a One word. School. The unfamiliar maybe? \n\nI have Social Anxiety along with my SM so I was often mute even at Family gatherings especially when family came from the US to visit. I feel you on this one. Looking at old pictures or videos I have no problem talking with my close family. But definitely for a lot of kids with selective mutism school is way too unfamiliar, and scary. It is just so weird and sad \ud83e\udd72 I have overcame it but still feel shy Fuck school it ruined my life lmaoooo I talked less at family gatherings the older I got. So weird", "What to do with this character? I am stuck on what to do. I am working on a video game that has the main character have selective mutism. That decision was made to help others with selective mutism be represented and feel heard. Also a bit because my friend does not entirely understand selective mutism and I have it. My problem is that there are people that fake disorders and selective mutism would be really easy to fake. By having the main character have selective mutism it might prompt other people to fake the disorder. I really do not want that to happen because it is extremely hard to get people to believe people with the disorder in the first place. I do not want to bring more hatred to the disorder, but I also want for people with selective mutism to be represented. I really hate that they ever decided to call it selective mutism, because it is an, any possible situation, anxiety thing...not a 'shyness' thing.\n\nThe only way is to explain it, other than that people will fake or they will understand. People already cannot comprehend it even if they continuously try to. My Parents, Sisters, do not get it....not in any correct way. My brother is just so chill it does not really matter.\n\nI think it is a very dumb/hard thing to fake to any extent anyone who actually has it is extent. First of all, bravo for some representation of SM! There is not nearly enough of that in popular culture, and I feel as though nobody in my life truly understands it, and I hope someday in the future as representation increases, they will be able to. :) I have SM, and I agree that it would be extremely difficult and almost impossible to fake. Selective mutism is an extreme anxiety disorder which cannot be helped by the person suffering from it. It affects their life in ways that make necessary tasks like school and work a living nightmare. It is not just a once a week experience for people living with SM to be unable to speak in social situations, it is every single day. Most of the research out there covers SM in children, but it is often forgotten that teens and even adults can still suffer from SM. And I agree, it is not a \u201cshyness\u201d thing at all, it is a real disorder that is often left in the dark. So for me, I say go ahead with this character and shine some light on selective mutism for those who do not suffer with it! It might also be helpful for those who do suffer with it, because it was not until last year that I realized SM was actually a recognized disorder by itself. Just make sure you are portraying this character as an ordinary human being who happens to suffer from SM in their life, and I would not recommend making the whole focus of the game about selective mutism as a disorder, because that might could be perceived as disrespectful to people who suffer with SM. Also, maybe provide some trusted sources about selective mutism along with your game so people can learn for themselves that people who suffer with SM are actually out there, and they should be aware of this. Please let me know if you have any other questions! I agree! Did not selective mutism used to be called \u201celective mutism\u201d? I have researched this in the past. Before this disorder was really understood, doctors though people with SM were choosing or \u201celecting\u201d themselves not to speak to certain people in their lives, but we know now that is actually not the case. Just a little fun fact lol", "\ud83d\ude22 Do not you all hate it when you are about to answer a question by nodding or shaking you head but then you hear them say or? YES this happens to me constantly. Why cannot they just ask yes/no questions only? So frustrating. Is not this part of therapy to avoid yes/no questions and ask forced choice and open ended questions. I understand that you are reluctant to speak as it makes you uncomfortable. But, point of asking such questions is to make you comfortable being in uncomfortable situation. I know it is supposed to be helpful long term, but in the moment my throat dries up and I want to teleport back home for a nice glass of water and I think too much. I also do not have a therapist because my mom cannot find any near us that are covered by our insurance. (BIG OOF) \ud83d\ude43 Probably because humans are complex creatures capable of complex thought/communication, and deliberately reducing our speech to yes/no questions is silly? Like you said, humans are complex creatures which are *also* capable of reducing our speech to yes/no questions to help someone who is unable to speak and can only communicate nonverbally. Actually, no. That is only for SM\u2019ers who are able to be more verbal/are more comfortable. And people with SM are not exactly \u201creluctant\u201d to speak. SM is not voluntary. People with SM experience paralyzed vocal cords in the settings where they cannot speak. We cannot speak no matter how much we want to. Do not get me wrong. I am parent of child who is suffering from SM. I am not saying it is choice. Reluctance here is involuntarily learned behaviour and it is not choice.\n\nMy understanding of situation is, child when gets anxious tries to avoid situation by being mute. Adult often rescues to avoid embarrassment which negatively reinforces child behaviour of being mute. Over period of time, this becomes practice and child learns to cope anxiety through avoidance. Only way to break this mechanism is by presenting small goals and gradually increase them. So, if someone is asking you forced choice question, they are putting you through out of comfort zone to help you overcome this problem.\n\nAsking only yes/no question and allowing child to answer non verbally negatively reinforces the condition. Hence if you are able to answer forced choice questions with bit of struggle, it is good to prompt you with forced choice questions. But like you said, it needs to be done in *small goals*. Having just anyone (like a stranger) ask the SM\u2019er \u201cforced\u201d choice questions is a step too far ahead, unless said SM\u2019er is already somewhat verbal. It is simply not going to work. Instead, you need to bring in someone that the SM\u2019er *can already* speak fully to when they are in a comfortable setting, and have *that* person ask the choice questions, and then have the SM\u2019er whisper/mumble their response to that person. This may not even work for SM\u2019ers who are on the more severe side. Note that the person is usually going to be someone like the parent, sibling, or partner of the SM person. *Not a stranger*, since most people with SM cannot speak to strangers. It just will not work out lol. I have had SM all my life, and have been in all these situations before. When someone attempts to \u201chelp\u201d me by asking a choice question, I can never respond, thus, I get absolutely nowhere recovery wise. Agree. But, we hardly use forced choice questions even if we are talking to normal person. For instance, if we meet a kid, we are more likely to ask which school she/he goes to instead of asking whether she goes to school A or school B.\n\nWhen OP mentioned forced choice questions - I assumed it to be coming from people who are aware of the condition and trying to help him/her (As chances of intentionally asking forced choice questions are less)\n\nDespite all these, asking questions without pressurizing too much to answer is still good. I do not mind at all if a stranger asks my daughter a question and I will not be disappointed if she does not answer. Asking questions assures the kid that there is still expectations to speak. If they know there is no expectation to speak, it will become more difficult to overcome it. lmao &gt;asking questions assures the kid that there is still expectations to speak. And if they know there is no expectation to speak, it will become more difficult to overcome it.\n\n\u201cAssures\u201d? No. Every psychologist who treats SM will tell you that is literally the *exact opposite* of what you are supposed to do. SM is based around the expectation to speak. The higher the expectation is, the worse the SM will be. Thus, part of treatment for SM is to *take away* the expectation to speak when talking to the SM\u2019er. Not add it on more. The expectation of speech/pressure will only make SM worse, and can even cause regression if you are not careful. \n\nThis is one of the first things my psychologist who treated my SM told my parents to do. I have experienced all this myself. The expectation of speech *will* make it worse. The expectation of speech from the people was so strong I ended up regressing to the point of being unable to speak much even at home. Outside of the home, I could not even communicate by using nonverbal communication. I was completely frozen and paralyzed when I was approached.\n\nNow hopefully you see the harm in it. &gt;Lmao. \u201cAssures\u201d? No. Every psychologist who treats SM will tell you that is literally the   \n&gt;  \n&gt;exact opposite  \n&gt;  \n&gt; of what you are supposed to do.\n\nYou are missing point here. Expectation is not same as overwhelming pressure. This is the reason why parent rescuing kids when others ask questions is not advised. Asking questions is good. But, pressurizing to answer is not. \n\nCan you please provide any source where it is advised not to ask questions to SM kid at all? Or else, we are just beating around the bush.\n\nI understand that there will not be any questions involved in CDI phase of therapy (If that is what you are talking about). And type of questions based on level of anxiety etc. in VDI phase. But, should never ask question to SM kid?? - I never heard of this. You misunderstood what I said. When did I say not to ask the SM person no questions at all? Nowhere. I merely said to get rid of the expectation to speak. You can do that while still speaking to them lol. I suppose I did not make my meaning clear enough. My apologies.", "Worrisome development My six year old has recently stopped talking to her Dad (my husband) most mornings. Nothing notable happened prior to this. This is a step in the wrong direction, of course. He works an evening shift and is often only here for a couple of hours in the late morning and two days off a week. Is there anything that we can do to restore him as her \"safe\" person? TIA If not treated, SM can sometimes worsens overtime and eventually becomes something called \u201cprogressive mutism\u201d. Progressive mutism is where they cannot speak to any person in any situation, even at home with family. I am not sure there is much you can do right now to help her be able to speak to him, other than treatment, (which typically entails exposure therapy with baby steps, cognitive behavioral therapy, meds, understanding from family/friends, and school or work support) which will be a slow process. I am going to compare it to my situation. I only saw my dad on the weekends so I stopped talking to him. I saw all my male relatives every couple of months so I stopped talking to them. So not seeing them enough made me lose them as a safe person.. But I also spoke to family friends that I saw only a couple of months and trusted less than my dad but still spoke to them. I loved my dad more than anyone (He passed away 13 years ago) but still could not speak.\n\nEveryones case of selective mutism is different and I cannot really tell you good ways to make him a \"safe\" person but here is some tips that worked in my situation:\n\n1. karaoke, my sister and dad would use a karaoke machine and I felt left out so I would sing with them (very quietly but it was still something)\n2. no pressure but also do not let them carry on thinking not talking to her father is fine. I can speak for all selective mutism sufferers when I say that pressure makes everything worse but sometimes its needed because other wise they will stop trying to talk because they feel safe not talking and do not actually want to talk.\n3. Have the father have inside jokes with your daughter. May be hard to make an inside joke but she will feel safe when she feels like she is in on a secret with one person and she will see that person as a super safe person\n\nI am not an expert, I am just a 20 year old girl that still cannot talk because I did not get any help because my mum stopped trying to fix me after age 7.

At that time, that was my main concern as opposed to my anxiety, which is definitely the priority now.\n\nAnyway, I went to this psychiatrist who was.. let us say.. not that good at his job. I went in with my mom looking for something to help with my unending sadness, and she mentioned my anxiety. I was expecting you know, anxiety/depression medication but this guy literally prescribed me an antipsychotic which my mom told him someone in my family had a history of addiction to. So that was odd. He also prescribed me other things, all in very low doses yet still not any type of anti anxiety or anti depressants. That is not really the weird part though.\n\nThis guy asked questions in a kind of stern way, which to me felt pretty threatening. My mom answered for me, which we did not think would be a problem because we made it very clear that I had told her prior to every appointment what to say to him. But at every single appointment, he kept saying, \"She needs to talk. I need to hear that from her. There is no way for me to help if she does not tell me herself.\" and looking back on that.. I feel pretty manipulated and very uncomfortable knowing that someone in that field did not even.. suggest the possibility that I was mute? I was not diagnosed at all at this time, and I obviously was not talking. My mom told him that I am an anxious person too. Would not mutism be the first thing on your mind? It was just really weird.\nHe also had this really pushy thing where he was like, \"I cannot help you until she gets therapy. She needs to get therapy. She needs to be able to talk to me so I can help her.\" Like.. Is not that.. oddly forceful?\n\nNowadays I have a new psychiatrist, which I got about... 3-4 years after that incident who is so much nicer. I am so happy about that. I have not talked to her at all, yet it is completely fine. She prescribed me an actual anxiety medication, unlike someone..... And my mom told her about my old psychiatrist and she also said that the things he did were strange. It was very funny and relieving to hear her say things like \"Oh gosh.. I would never prescribe that for her. a\nAnd, frankly... I do not know anyone who would.\" \ud83d\udc80\n\nHer demeanor is so calm and refreshing when I compare her to him \ud83d\ude07 Glad to say I feel way better now than I did back then \ud83d\ude09", "I do not know if I have selective mutism or not. hey yall. so ill explain my story.\n\nI was in a lot of hospitals in my childhood, for some problems I do not really like to talk about.\n\nbut anyhow, at some hospitals, let us say I did not have the best of experiences with the staff. \n\nat some point I remember getting out of a car and deciding something that changed my life - I am not going to talk with these people anymore. it started from hospital staff, but then it evolved to basically everyone in my personal life. even when I came back to school after being in the hospital I did not speak with even my best friend. I hate even thinking about that day I returned.\n\nwhen I started playing online games and meeting new people there, I did not want to talk to them too. but for some reason, i decided to buy a mic and talked with the people that I have chatted with for so long.

I think she is abusive. \n\nI sometimes question if she was really abusive  of if I was oppositional or if I was just taking things more sensitive than a normal kid and am not remembering things right it will be abusive even if you \"were more sensitive\". you were a child and your parent was an adult. you had an underdeveloped brain that would be so easily traumatized, she didnt care about that and still did the things she did. the commenters on that post are so right. i get the need to question it, to doubt yourself, that is what that kind of of child abuse does to a kid. you were gaslit into believing it wasnt real abuse because those \"were only the worse days\" as you said in your post. they probably werent the worst days, if you trauma caused you to block out so much you probably had \"worse\" days a lot. That is not normal parenting. That is absolutely abusive. That is absolutely not normal parenting. Move out if you can. \n\nI am a parent of an autistic kid, and it is hard sometimes. But no physical abuse should ever happen, no matter how hard parenting can be.\n\nI know if my mom, an alcoholic teenaged single parent, had a laid back, easy child, she might not have been such a shitty parent. I am autistic, and I know it must have been hard for her. But that is no excuse for abuse. If you take on the role of a parent, you take on the responsibility of a parent. Your mom is definitely abusive. What is normal, though, is you questioning whether it was abuse. As kids, we are programmed to accept whatever our parents do as normal and right, which is why many people with abusive parents take a while to realize it. If a kid is punished unfairly, often they will feel like it was their fault, like there is something wrong with them. \n\nIt was not your fault, though. Selective mutism can come from trauma, but even if it does not, it is the parent's job to be understanding and to try to help, not to punish the child for something beyond their control. That is abusive under any circumstances. For context, if I try to think of situations like this wih my Mom, I cannot even think of one thing. I am sorry you have had to live through that and I hope you can find some space to heal. Therapy or counseling is helpful if you can access it (maybe through your college). If you are selective mute, I am going to say your caregiver was the problem. In my case, it was my mother. I only found comfort in my dad. All of my good traits came from him. I was in preschool but grew out of it! I thought it was something people were born with? I always thought it was genetic like autism or something but I am not autistic. Is it caused by trauma tho? It is an anxiety disorder, and as such can be caused by trauma. That is not the only possible cause. But it makes sense that after a person undergoes trauma, especially as a child, they would be prone to anxiety. Sometimes there might be a specific reason for it to take the form of selective mutism, other times it might just be chance. Apraxia of speech, love? \n\nSelective mutism is a severe anxiety disorder. Apraxia of speech is delayed onset speech due to neurological circumstances I was diagnosed with selective mutism but talked to friends and family normally Selective mutism \ud83e\udd70 My mom threw a hot pot of stew in my bedroom all over my belongings when she was angry at me one time when I was a kid. I always thought that was my fault .. but the cake thing you posted made me realize it was not. \n\nI have ASD and am a very sensitive person, its hard to reconcile that with also having an abusive parent. Do not feel like you are not entitled to your trauma. It is OK to accept that you were not perfect either but children should not have to be perfect, they should be guided. So you were being an appropriately imperfect child. And adults should have been taking care of you. \n\nXoxo Wow, your mom seems like an awful person. This is absolutely 100% abuse. If I where you I would move , you need to get out of that situation because it is toxic.", "Selective Mutism with jobs Hello, my dads trying to force me to get a job. Wondering how and when I should let my possible boss know I have selective mutism? Yes, definitely tell your boss about it, preferably during your interview process.

I do not know the best about timing to let someone know, nor do I know if its required to disclose. In the past dealing with injuries, I know the process involves employees asking an employer for a list of tasks required to fulfilled the specific role and work with a professional (in this case. presumably a therapist) to identify what specific accommodations are needed. This list above might be helpful to supplement the list because there may not be things listed in the task list provided by the employer that they have not thought of as a task but you would (ie. communication with coworkers, customers, management). I believe you can ask the workplace for their requirements for documentation for meeting accommodations for disabled people. This process is going to be different from employer to employer and some employers are not aware of the legal requirements or may not have thought of a process. I recommend documenting as much as you can - I like to ask for written or printed copies of things or takes notes if I can or record things if its allowed. Even its just a simple log of interactions.", "I journal a lot as a way to cope with my selective mutism. It helps me feel less trapped in my own head. It is nice to have a place where I can be myself and know no one will judge me for it. Here is a picture of all the notebooks I have finished in the past 2,5 years. They are my pride and joy\u263a\ufe0f  that is an awesome idea. what an achievement, too, to finish all of those! i think i will start journaling more often. Wow, that is incredible! I used to journal a lot - I do not know why I stopped. Well, thanks for the reminder!\n\nNice color-coding by the way! That is an amazing coping mechanism. I personally cope quite similarly: poetry and painting, the occasional short story. I am proud of you too for finishing those, I always leave mine halfway through. :D I really want to read them. you are welcome! I hope I can inspire you to write more:) It really is! The feeling when you finish a journal is so amazing. I hope you get to experiance it someday too! thanks:) I kind of envy you, I have always wanted to get into poetry and painting but I never stick with it because I am extreamly bad and do not have the patience it takes to get better... Let us be honest, I could say the same about you and journaling, and truly I am just doing it for the same reasons you do journaling: to get thoughts out. It brings me comfort, so I do not even care if it is good or not, and then time doing it over and over eventually makes it better and better. It is mostly about what works fot the way we think. Journaling keeps things neat and tidy, you got your bullet points and your sideline doodles. Poems and painting are inherently messy, only you yourself really understand what is going on in them and they are abstract in shape. My thoughts vary a lot from just emotions and movements and abstract sound to photographic pictures, full sentences and conversations, and subconscious knowing. I have ran into a lot of people who think in narration or bullet points and they are great at working through their thoughts using note taking methods like bullet points or a mind map. my mutism enviroment is home and my mother reads every diary i had wrote. my sisters read some of them too. so i do not do that one anymore.

She has been dealing with social anxiety for some times and lately it has been more severe and may have lead to selective mutism.", "Found something that pops me back into SM: Improv I went to an improv practice for the first time this week. There were like 8 people there. The teacher asked us what our biggest fears were, and mine was \"going blank.\" Everyone else's was more like, \"not getting a reaction\" or \"what I say will not be funny\" but for me, it was just freezing. Sure enough that kept happening. The others seemed to be able to have stuff to say, even if it was lame, but for me, I kept going blank. I was a familiar feeling, but I kept pushing through it anyway throughout the night.\n\nEven at the end I refused to go on stage kind of defiantly, against the social pressure of the group. Then after driving home I was analyzing it, and remembered where I felt like that before, pretty much my whole childhood. Almost like every conversation with SM is like being on a stage with an audience of 100 people, and you forgot your lines.\n\nI definitely have a huge anxiety around doing stuff like that, but that is partly why I do it. Imrov seem like the biggest dragon to slay, so... I kind of want to slay it. For context, my SM was mostly before 5th grade, but occasionally still get like \"triggered\" back into it You can do it! Oh, and I forgot. They conned me into going up at the end anyway with the promise that I did not have to say anything. Only if I felt like it. So I was able to just do actions, and it felt much better, and that is why I remembered SM, cuz that is totally how it was. I am okay if no one NEEDS me to talk. If you are cool with me being silent, then I am not nearly as anxious What helped you get over it when you were younger? I am not quite sure, but here is some thoughts:\n1) I had a speech impediment, and my 4th grade teacher caught it, and we fixed it pretty quick.\n2) I became a \u201cskater\u201d so... kind of just finding an identity helped boost my confidence a bit\n3) I picked up clarinet in 4th grade. I played it all shy that first year. All the clarinetists did. Then my brother one day was like, just freakin blast that thing. Why you playing so quite? I figured I was supposed to. So next band practice I blasted it, and blew my conductor away, and the whole band noticed and thought it was cool. It is almost like the clarinet could be my voice, the music was my words, and it was already written, so it was a matter of just getting good at reading it. So it kind of gave me practice in a safer way. Plus we are playing in a group, so if I messed up, not too many people noticed, it seemed. That was 5th. I think the instrument might have been a big factor. I definitely still struggled, but it just slowly got better. Part of it was finding the next fear, and slowly doing it anyways. Do it afraid. Usually you mess up a bit, but go back to the logic and mindfulness of it all. Like I did not do well that time, it is not the end of the world, try to do better next time.\n\nOr maybe puberty just flipped a switch, lol. Idk Love the way you said \u201cdo it afraid.\u201d  You have an awesome mindset. The fact you even went to an improv class and faced your fears like that is super impressive. It will probably get easier in time, I would love to try the same thing but I need to build up courage! There is definitely stages before that I have slowly checked off that helped get here (not that you need to necessarily need to work up to it). Like performing in a band, public speaking (church forced me to do that a ton. Totally had a complex at first and got decent in 12th grade, acting (memorized and playing a role and not yourself probably helps) Definitely would still be too scared to actually do improv in front of an audience. Not sure if I will get there. Not sure if it is my cup of tea Thanks, only when I am not depressed. I seem to have either bipolar 2 or lately I have been wondering about DID. Like I may have learned to just dissociate from that intense fear, and then I formed different identities, and then locked the SM kid in a closet. I do have a weird age complex thing. I do not know, but I definitely pop back into it sometimes. And I am pretty sure sometimes it is just too overwhelming to function. If panic is at a 10, I cannot just fake being charismatic. Only to certain extent, but sometimes I just feel more confident, and the charisma happens. So... it is just complicated I guess. I do not want to reduce it down to some easy saying, even though there is some truth to it  ", "Small Update to I cannot believe some businesses and services insist upon phone calls So, I messaged another clinic and pointed out how it could be easier for them in only a somewhat peeved manner.. and they answered most of the questions(the one left was somewhat of a quibble) within an hour even though I specifically used taking time as part of the argument -- of course with text you do not know what kind of emotions are behind them, so I may have gotten some serious contempt -- but I think they would have said if conveying that info some way other than actual word of mouth were harmful in some way, like people bringing in terrified ferals in carriers or tied in a blanket somehow.

That Is basically saying \u201cwe dont want to have set prices so that way we can change them from person to person\u201d. Unless you absolutely need to I wouldnt go there. \n\nYou are 100% right in that it would be much easier for them to write everything in an email. That way both parties have a copy of what was said, nothing can be forgotten, and in general makes it easier for both parties to have the time to write what they actually want to say instead of hurriedly speaking over the phone. \n\nI would also suggest that no matter how annoying it gets just force yourself to be completely kind. Any sort of expressed anger/frustration/annoyance/etc will make them slower and less enthusiastic to reply and less likely to comply with what you want. Even if theyre for some reason supposed to handle all interactions through a phone call, theyre more likely to make an exception if youre over the top nice.

So back story time. In elementary school I was bullied alot causing me to only have two friend who I could truly trust with my life. Sixth grade I started to occasionally not be able to talk. The only noises I could make is more animal like. Through 7th and 8th grade it got worse and more  common. Keep in mind I am still being bullied though middle school. Now  I am in 9th grade and the inability to speak is getting so frequent that I start to document, observe, and collect data about everything I do to use to help me research. I came across selective mutism in the DSM-5, and it seemed to provide answers and explanations about everything I have documented. What do you guys think? It could be. If you identify with the symptoms I would definitely say it is a possibility. It is always a good idea to go see a psychologist if you have a suspicion.

I used to be able to talk to my family just fine but it is been getting harder and harder until I am at the point I am almost completely isolating myself. I cannot say anything I want, I can only say a few words at a time and I talk so quiet no one can hear me, even when I am trying to yell. I have been avoiding them and other people at all costs, planning my days around avoiding them because the humiliation and shame of not being able to talk is too much to bear. I feel trapped and alone and I stopped trying to reach out because no one understands. I cannot talk enough to go to a doctor and my mom will not help me with stuff like that anymore. I cannot talk to ANYONE.  Try writing your feelings -in your on way- and give it to them, if you are not able to do so then try talking to the animals or trees -I, sincerily prefer trees but both are great listeners- to train your speaking skills and, most importantly, to not get depressed, because people with Selective Mutism tend to get depressed if not treated. If you prefer to \"talk\" on the internet, on social networks, or somewhere else, it is okay. And try showing your 'symptoms' to your family and reconnect with them somehow.

While I am not OP, I can answer this one.\n\nI have found that it *is* actually easier for me to speak to people who are more shy, or have SM  too. You know they understand so they would never pressure you to speak, or worse. It also helps that we automatically have something in common, so you can always discuss that. Hey! I am sorry for such a late reply but this is not a stupid question. To me it definitely is easier to talk to other quiet/sm people.

I was crying in the car today after my Dad left that car to go test drive my Brother's car (getting fixed).....I choose not to go as I was not feeling up to it......And in a way it is kind of Music (I was listening to LAROI in the car when he left on my phone) that is been helping keep my emotions more in check. It is very relatable lately, in particular The Kid LAROI. Well anyway, my Goal to speak by (optimistic) is the 31st...so in 1 hour and 15 mins as I write this...will that happen? Well you never know....\n\nAnyway the mindset has definitely overhauled since I wanted to change exactly 32 days ago. I think I have gone back and forth between this, am I afraid to commit to speaking...or am I still afraid of those reacting. I think I have gone back to the later, I think I am still afraid of those reacting, in particular my Dad....the thing is if my Parents/Siblings did not know me, I would be able to speak to them. I have also acquired this thinking that you sort of just speak your mind, right? So conversating would not be that hard....maybe starting a convo since I do not have a lot to talk about....but talking or really typing, online I am very good at, I can really go off on r/teenagers if you catch me on the right night there (I am 18).\n\nI think I need to re-convey that mindset to my Mom, since last time I told her...\"the reaction does not help....\" something like that, and she relayed that to the family. I think I need to tell her this, \"If you could forget that I did not speak, I think I would be able to speak pretty easily.\" I would still feel odd about it, but I am sitting in the kitchen tonight, and I am eating Friendly's my sister brought home....and I am just coming back from the nightly car show with my Dad in my car....and I have not been overall happy lately this month, but in that moment it is just a great overwhelming feeling (euphoria) and I feel like my mouth just wants to burst open, but I feel like if I do, that would be so strange....although I have been talking more in ways I usually did not just two days ago. I think starting on the 29th is when I committed to really making myself uncomfortable. That was the next day after telling my mom I hated the reaction.\n\nOn the 29th I was going with my Dad to Burger King, and on the way there he had to pick up a movie from the library....so I go in with his card and I talk to the lady, one sentence \"I am picking up\" (he stays in the car)...and I can talk to strangers although I am nervous....it was fine, I was fine.....it was mainly to do it with my Dad in the realization of me doing it......although once back in the car he was left unsure if I spoke to the lady or not, I did not disclose that to him when he asked.\n\nToday, well idk, I just spoke more....but what it is, is I am not really surpassing one word or two word phrases with family (besides my Mom sometimes, but I speak very roughly-cut). I feel like maybe I am falling into a rut here, in that way at least. I think I am in a very optimistic mood atm, just listening to my Spotify Playlist that I made today.....while writing this. I have been manifesting (not that I believe in it)...but to manifest a mindset, that I can get behind. I ate Mint icecream from Friendly's instead of Chocolate since they messed the order up, nonetheless. I have just been doing a lot that is odd from my normal. I have also been trying to be more open/honest even if I come off as brutal, to questions asked. If it comes to bite me, it bites me.\n\nI said 'No' decently loud at times, to my dad a few times today, because he has the issue where he will finish or try to finish what I am trying to say...and that annoys me and hurts me, I still have to properly disclose that, once again....I did today disclose \"finishing my speech is bad,\" but it was not taken correctly (my Mom thought it was about her, not in general of the family) when I told her finishing what I am trying to say is bad.....I think she took it as 'interrupting' instead too, not 'finishing my speech,' which is what I meant.\n\nAnyways, I think I want the change when it comes to committing to talking...it is just I need to be prepared to really put myself out there, and I could....it is just the extreme reaction I am afraid of in reality. I wish my Family did not know me or about me.\n\nHopefully tomorrow this mindset grows and this is not for nothing. I know I have ranted and raved a lot on here, and I guess I sort of feel like I am doing this for you guys as well. I feel like I want to do it, to prove to myself and more to you, that we can if we really want to. It is never too late.\n\nAnd to just add since I am writing so much, when I grew up I would LOVE The Sims (Old Callmekevin Sims 3 videos), but when I played it I was disappointed because it is imagination based. It is nothing like real life...in GTA V I wished they would add normal 9-5 Jobs.....I think I have always wanted this normal life, and was stuck in my own world thinking that was what I wanted; in a game, when in reality I wanted it IRL, not in a game........I just want to unlock more in life, and I hope talking will get me there. It is so crazy to think how everyone else has something so crucial to easier success, speech is probably the most powerful thing we have in this world. If you can speak well, you can make it in anyway you think of. That is it for this night's rant...I will be back do not worry.\n\n**Also I have a question to add to my rant:** What was it like transferring from a few words to more interjecting phrases and sentences to those you could not communicate normally with? How? If you want girls, you should change your mindset into not being \"soft\". I dont mean to call you that in an offensive way, cause i was \"soft\" for a good 97% of my life until envy and then hate at a certain group of people from school who were semifriends to me (i talked to them on discord basically daily, but i was a clear outsider among them). If that never happened i wouldve still been \"self-illusioned\" into thinking they actually gave a fuck about me.\n\nThe goal now should be to be absolutely comfortable in your own skin and completely shed what can be called the overwhelming insecurity caused by sm. \n\nAnd, the unfortunate news is *from what i know* no one in existence has succeeded in solving this dilemma of the inner mind. Not me either. I absolutely dont want to tear down your hope, however. It should be possible for us to win, as sitting with the many many fears caused by sm should lower them if we dont hide from the fear.\n\n\nEvery week for me is a bunch of new insights and mini discoveries, but the best they have done is shorten the path somewhat. If i had all knowledge ever, yeah id probably take the most direct path to curing sm, but it would probably not be like flipping a switch.\n\nTips : fear will deadass brainwash you sometimes. In the moment, i sometimes gave up when \"sitting with the fear\" and found myself making up some reason why i should stop making myself talk. Moments after leaving, i realized that that made up reason was bullshit. And this has happened more than once. Btw nowadays i train by playing Apex and queuing into arenas (cause theres usually more ppl with mics on there) I am good for all advice, what do you mean by \"soft\" exactly? Or in more detail (not trying to be defensive in that question). I just want to learn from as many people as possible, and as much as possible here. I will be honest, I have started to cry in part that I am afraid I will lose out on even talking to this girl over text, and I have her number....which, yeah....Though I acquired it via my Mom's phone (without her knowledge)....when we met her, I did not speak to her... my Mom got her number to share photos with her. The girl was into my car and gave us parts for it, and had the same exact car (2001 Mustang Bullitt GT)...and regretted selling hers. So my dad and I figure that would be the way to 'hang out' with her. Though when he brings up hanging out with her, I never give a yes/no, I just give him a blank stare.....that is another problem, I cannot discuss or admit those kinds of feelings in any way, I think that is part of my Dad again....he tends to put me on this kid pedestal, when I am not. My Mom would understand that blank stare, but he takes that as me being un-interested, or not serious about it, and the topic being so over the top sensitive, I cannot disclose anything any further...it is crazy enough I do not outright deny it, which in the past I would have 100% of the time.\n\nAnd yeah, I think it is that....I have to really discover myself before I can go too deep into that goal of mine, which is admittedly far off and probably will not occur as time keeps slipping on away. It is been 33days since meeting that girl which is where the real realization came, although the realization of changing was definitely coming on.....since I already had cried in an Outback for no real reason before that 33 days ago.....just it would not have come on this fast if I did not bump into that girl with my family.\n\nI think change will definitely always be on me in some way, but I got to keep the goals optimistic, I think that gives me the best drive. I know in the end, I tend to shoot myself in the foot. Though recently I have started to come more into myself, and I tend to be comfortable in public, not really with my Dad though, I think I am so inclined to picture \"my best self\" for him, which is horrible....but then I go to this car show with my Dad and I just feel so in-comparable to all these other guys there....although I am not bad-looking, I am not someone who is highly attractive, but not bad....So that insecurity is something I need to work on.....my Dad is something I need to work on, he is a big part of my change issues. Lately though, these last two days I have felt more like an individual vs a child...which I tend to always feel like.\n\nThe mindset also tends to be when I am with my entire family when I am the most confident/inclined to want to talk, when they leave and it is just me and my Mom or me and my Dad, I tend to lose that drive. I think because then I would have to go individually to speaking to them more normally in the instances.\n\nAnd In my mind, I tend to always think...**one day**, that is all you need to change....but then I never take that one day....that is all I need to change, it just is not possible. Maybe though, and I guess that is just what I need to go off, though I have to make at least some progress in some way new each day.\n\nHit me with any advice or insight you have, as long as you are being truthful and honest, it can be anything. This sub has definitely given me more confidence when it comes to relationships and such things. I used to think I was destined for nothing. Also I think I am most confident of myself alone.....when it comes to being around others that are not family\n\nAlso I think I tend to get naturally defensive with these things, even though I do want honest/true responses...so if I come off that way. ", "5 Year Old Daughter Suffers from SM. Considering Treatment Options... My 5 and a half year old daughter suffers from Selective Mutism. From the time she was less than a year old, she has suffered with incredible anxiety in social situations. For the past 2 years in pre-school, she has not said a word. She will not even talk to her best friends when they play. She is going to start kindergarten soon and we really want to get help for her so that she will get some relief.\n\nShe has seen a therapist regularly for the past year, but she has not made any progress. The therapist suggested that we consider pharmacological treatment since she has not been able to help much. We met with a psychiatrist who prescribed a very low dose of Zoloft. The idea of treating her this way would have seemed crazy to me a year ago, but at this point, I just want to do anything I can to help her. I do not want her starting kindergarten wearing diapers because she is too afraid to ask to go to the bathroom. I want  to wash away some of the debilitating anxiety she feels in social situations so that she can be her real self. In private, I see a funny, loud, and sweet child. In school and public settings, I see a child constantly paralyzed with fear. I feel like the longer she is the \"kid who does not talk\", the harder it will be to overcome.\n\nTLDR; For parents, what are your thoughts on treating SM with drugs? For those with SM, I would love your opinion. As someone who grew up with crippling social anxiety, I personally wish someone would have been able to help me break out of my shell to be my normal self. I appreciate your thoughts. &gt; I feel like the longer she is the \"kid who does not talk\", the harder it will be to overcome.\n\nAs someone with SM, this is very, very true. I have never been treated with medication, but I think it is definitely worth a shot. It is understandable that some parents are weary with using drugs to treat their children, but SM can be such a seriously crippling disorder, which is something that those parents might not realize until too late.\n\nI watched a talk on SM a while ago. The talk discussed statistics in treating SM, and how doing BOTH medicine-treatment AND cognitive-behavioral treatment is the best way to go, in comparison to no treatment or only one form of treatment. Thank you for your thoughts.  I have a 4 yr old boy who is been diagnosed with SM and OCNDS and have been struggling to find the right care for him in Ohio. So far no luck and there is no wait lists or anyone willing to evaluate him due to the OCNDS or at least that is what we have been told by Nation Children\u2019s in Columbus &amp; Cincinnati does not anything available. My daughter was similar to yours.  We knew from very early on, before she was walking, that she had some kind of social anxiety.  She was nearly silent in 2 years of pre-school and very very quiet in kindergarten.  \nWe too started her on meds in first grade for the school year.  (Low dose of Prozac.). At that time, it did not seem to work.  We (my husband and I) were consulting with Jonathan Berent via phone conferencing ( he is in NY and we are in PA) but he was very abrasive and we did not find any value after a year with him. Then we tried play therapy.  My daughter never spoke to the therapist in 18 months- the therapist knew nothing about SM and kept trying to tell me she had been sexually abused. Not true, she was so \u201cshy\u201d that she was never out of my presence for it to happen...\nAnother therapist last year saw her once and refused to treat her until I took her to an eating disorder clinic.  Therapist would not believe me that she grew a huge amount in the past year and just could not keep up calories-wise, plus her anxiety making her belly upset.\nThe next therapist tried, but did not have the specific tools to help with this specialized type of anxiety.\nI wish I had taken her to a SM specific therapist back then.  She is 14 now and still battling the same demons.  She has shown improvements since being in treatment with Dr.  Elisa Shipon-Blum at the SMart Center in PA.  She does not have any other diagnoses like some other kids we have read about.  She is currently taking sertraline and that has helped (for almost a year now.). She has put in weight, very muscular and getting there.\n\nTl;dr\n\nTake your SM kid to someone who knows SM inside and out, the earlier the better.\n I cannot imagine how frustrating it would be to have a therapist blame it on sexual abuse. Similar to yours, our daughter will not leave our presence. There is no such thing as even getting a babysitter for a couple of hours and I imagine it is the same for you. I am glad to hear that she has been improving.\n\nFortunately, our therapist is very familiar with SM and has written some articles on it. I am obviously not an expert, but she at least seems to be competent and incredibly patient to me. We are going to try sertraline at a very low dose and I am hoping it helps.", "Selective Mutism Questionnaire Update Hey everyone, it is me again. Thank you all so much for all the responses on my survey, it really means a lot! :,))\n\nEveryone is answers were very helpful, and I used what I have compiled to create another survey. It goes a bit more in depth, with optional written explanations. Or you can just stick to the multiple choice questions and be done in 5 minutes. Either way, your responses will once again be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe survey is (\n\n*(At the end there is a question asking if you would like to be interviewed as well.

I am available to be interviewed if you would like as well I am here totally confused how someone with sm is willing to get interviewed in the first place, and on something so personal I was worried I would not get many people, but a surprising number of people are willing to share their stories! Plus they are all over messages as opposed to face to face which most find more comfortable.", "Has anyone tried text-to-speech apps? And how did people react? This option appeals to me very much, but I am scared that people will not understand. I also feel guilty about giving app the idea of ever using my voice.", "I think my daughter is a selective mute how do I get her to talk My 4 year old daughter used to talk but in the past 2 years she has he has decided not to. She was in speech therapy but I did not like few therapists we tried. The first one spent most of the time talking to us instead of working with my daughter. The second and third one (the private practice we went to would switch between the two due to scheduling) said some negative things about my DD that made me question their abilities. specifically they said they think I should have her evaluated for autism but I dingy buy it. She makes eye contact with us, smiles, and plays with toys without lining them up. \n\nI talked to my pediatrician and said that she is very shy and will not talk to anyone. He suggested selective mutism and to go back to speech therapy. I am not sure what to do because speech therapy was a waste of money that. There have been no major events that would have caused her to go mute. I think it is behavioral. She has learned to rely on screaming and screeching over the past 2 years and now that is all she will use to communicate. I feel bad but it drives me insane listening to that all day. \n\nI took her out of preschool last year because I started working from home. All she does is scream at the tv or iPad all day when I am working. She has toys but has no interests in playing with them but shed probably scream at them too. My husband is starting to worry and ask questions to other parents. He is worried she has something wrong with her. I really think it is behavioral and do not see the point in wasting time and money to have my kid tested like a lab rat and have a diagnosis handed out like candy. She is SO smart. Before she stopped talking she knew her letters numbers and at only 2!\n\nI feel bad saying all she does is scream but it is tough to deal with. Even when its time to eat.  She scream at most food given to her. I have addressed this with her pediatrician and he suggested trying s few things and if they do not work, I should seek feeding therapy. \n\nHow can I deal with this? How can I encourage her to talk again? For starters, I would absolutely seek a diagnosis. Unfortunately without a diagnosis and without knowing the underlying issue, there is not much that can be done. Different psychological disorders have a very very different treatment path. I will say there are some signs here that are very indicative of autism. Whatever it be, having a diagnosis absolutely does not mean she is less smart, intelligent, or less capable. \n\nSecondly, selective mutism (SM) is **not** behavioral or a choice. SM is a severe social anxiety disorder that causes involuntary mutism. SM is driven by the perceived pressure of speech, which leads to a freeze response and you shut down. So because of this, your goal should not be getting her to talk, but decreasing anxiety and the pressure of speech. Therapy will help you and her with this. \n\nThe selective mutism center ( is a great resource of information, and they do provide therapy and treatment. I highly recommend them. I had SM myself, and I went there for treatment. I fully recovered and am now fully verbal.\n\nFeel free to reply or DM me if you have any questions. first of all: you did the right thing by coming to us for  an opinion - own voices are incredibly valuable, especially with commonly misunderstood disorders like sm.\n\nnow, selective mutism is not a choice. it is a social anxiety disorder that causes extreme anxiety around talking or typically vocalization. since your daughter screams, i would guess that she does not have sm, but i am far from a psychiatrist. sm also does not stem from any traumatic event.\n\nalso, on the matter of autism, it might be worth researching autism presentation in girls since it can be wildly different. most autism material is based off of white boys, so i would suggest looking at female autistic own voices.\n\nfor my opinion as someone who has selective mutism, however, the best way to get her to talk is to work on the anxiety first. try giving her alternate methods of communication, like asl or an aac app. \n\ni wish your family the best. you clearly love your daughter, and of course that is the most important thing that she needs. sorry this reply was a bit of a mess haha, but yeah. I agree with everything you said, except different people with SM have varying levels of communication. Some are fully nonverbal, while others are not able to use words, but rather communicate by sounds. Someone being able to use sounds does not mean they cannot have SM.   I do not think speech therapy would be very effective for selective mutism, unless perhaps the reason behind the anxiety that causes SM is some sort of speech impediment. Try seeking out a developmental/behavioral pediatrician. Therapy can be helpful too, I have heard, but that is going to vary as each child is different. For example, my son refuses to participate in therapy so his dev/beh ped suggested that we stop therapy for the time being, and hopefully resume once the underlying anxiety is more under control. Age 4 may be a bit young for medication, I am not sure. Some SSRIs are said to be helpful since SM comes from anxiety. I am 18 and this SM has affected me my entire life, seek opinions as you can get multiple. 2 years is more than enough time to seek that without question. \n\nEverybody is smart in their own right but it does not mean they cannot have their issues, it is not testing them like a lab rat when it is for their best interest. I would argue not testing would be worse off, and more keen to being treated as a lab rat. Basically it is just not something you can push aside because 'that cannot be my child, they are too smart.' You have noticed things over a long period of time, it is just seeking the right path or not, now.\n\nI struggle to talk to my Family, extended Family, old classmates, and people who know me as someone who does not talk....strangers can make me anxious but, it is doable. Sure sounds like autism to me. Hello! I agree with the other comments here, but I would also like to add that having a diagnosis of anything, be it SM or autism does not mean that the doctors do not think your daughter is unintelligent! Disorders like SM are in no way correlated to intelligence!\n\nSM is very, very rarely caused by a specific event, or ongoing stress. Most SM has no external because'.\n\nThere are behavioural aspects of SM as well, so a diagnosis can go hand in hand with addressing behavioural issues and many treatments such as cognitive 'behavioural' therapy and exposure therapy are founded on behavioural theories. So I would encourage you to continue to seek a diagnosis.\n\nI also think that the screaming at tv screens and other things does not really sound like an SM thing. Though it may just be related to behavioural issues it might also indicate another condition alongside SM, such as autism. Autism can present very differently in girls and boys, so just because she does not meet mainstream stereotypes of autism does not mean she does not have it. For most people with autism you would have no idea they have it from just meeting with them, and again it is not a comment on intelligence.\n\nedit: SM and autism are also commonly comorbid, so it is very worth considereing the possibility she has both.\n\nThe diagnosis of SM will not 'follow her' throughout her life, because it is a condition than can be 'recovered from'. It is better to have SM in her medical records but be recovered than to not have it in her records but still be mute. I agree that the possibility of autism is worth looking into.  High intelligence is common in autism, as well as selective mutism.  \"Before she stopped talking she knew her letters numbers and at only 2\" points to hyperlexia, frequently a sign of autism.  \"She screams at most food given to her\" suggests she may have sensory issues related to food, another common trait in autism. check out OP's post history. looks like they are here to convince themselves it is not autism... sounds like autism. get her tested.\n\nshe needs non-verbal communication methods so she does not use screaming. ask the speach therapist for non-verbal communication devices.\n\nyou need to chill. she knows you want her to speak and she cannot. stop trying to make her talk and start supporting what she can do. \n\nthe problem is not the daughter, it is you being ignorant about what the problem is and how to help her. You need education. You need to investigate solutions to the problem. You need to stop putting money ahead of her support. You need to honor the child you have and not the child you want her to be. \ud83d\udc4f", "If you could have tech speak for you, would you?

It is so hard to speak, and anything that can help me makes me ecstatic No. I would like to find out how to speak for myself, but to each their own. That could be dangerous. There is a reason we do not just say what pops into our head. I would if I could control what did and did not come out. I feel like the thoughts and words are all put together in my head but by the time they come out of my mouth sometimes it is the exact opposite of what I am trying to say or it comes out too jumbled to make sense when I can get the words out. I am pretty fine most days though so I do not think I would actually get one. I did speech therapy when I was younger and I believe that helped a lot. My mind thinks of weird things sometimes... I do not think it would be safe If I was still in control of what exactly I said, then probably but idk. If it was widely accepted then yes but if every time I did it, people were like wtf what is happening, it would probably make me even more anxious than just speaking normally", ".

(ex. my summer lesson teacher brought me outside of a classroom and yelled at me in front of nannies and moms until i talked, that is one of many similar incidents). the times i remember willingly/slightly enjoying talking were in contests, specifically a math contest where i had to communicate with my partner to figure out the math problem. this was an annual thing and winning was important to me and i had a crush on my partner so.\n\nso like yeah.. not sure abt it all but i have yet to try and talk to a proffesional about all this", "Books on selective mutism?

Have you guys tried bone conduction *headphones?* As a mother to a six year old daughter with selective mutism as well I am very excited for you and her! What does that have to do with selective mutism? Thank you so much  :) We have not.  I will research and ask her therapist Basically its a pair of headphones with a microphone that amplifies her own voice in her ear.

As someone who had SM and went through these milestones at school myself many years ago, *thank you* for not making a big deal about this to her face.

I clearly remember that cathartic, private excitement of whispering/speaking for the first time in a new setting or situation.\n\nOnce I was an adult, my mom let me read the diary she kept about my SM, and it was so interesting to see how proud she was of my milestones, even though she did not make a big deal of them at the time. I had not realized she would noticed all of the things she did through communication with my teachers and other parents. She knew how much I dreaded drawing attention to my progress, so she kept her excitement to herself, even though it was difficult because she wanted to praise me. I am grateful for that effort now and for getting to understand, even if much later, how proud she was of me at the time. If you do not already, it might be worth documenting things like this for your daughter to read later! Thank you so much for this response.  It makes me feel really happy that she is proud of herself.

I have accomendations for being mute and anxious but he knows I am not completely mute and my teachers act like they need to calm me down. It makes sense that he thinks that, but he is wrong. The teachers that know have not called him out on it. \n\nIf I can ever tell him, what would I tell him? If the situation ever came up, should I tell other people that I have SM? Does the general public even know or would I have to explain since it is not fairly common? \n\nHow would you explain it?", "l do not want to speak anymore I (18) just started seeing a therapist and we have barely scratched the surface of everything I have to work on. I know I have anxiety and depression, but I also suspect some form of derealisation. On top of this, I am growing increasingly uncomfortable with speaking. I can talk in situations where I am expected/need to, but it feels wrong and uncomfortable and can be a huge struggle to start. Sometimes I have no trouble at all and sometimes I cry at the thought of needing to speak. I already know sign language but no one I live with knows it and so it is practically useless. It seems to go hand-in-hand with overstimulation and feeling low, but it is not guaranteed to be cause by that. From what I know, selective mutism is a social anxiety disorder where people (generally kids) are afraid to/cannot talk in certain situations. It is also classified as something needed to be treated or it can contribute to depression and increase of anxiety. But for me, it is not tied to situations so much as days or weeks at a time and if I am forced I can speak, I just do not want to.  And I do not want to be \u201ctreated\u201d and instead just want to be able to live the way I am confortable. I am planning in discussing this with my therapist but I was curious to know if any who has been diagnosed or works with SM can give me some insight.  As someone who struggled with SM growing up and well into my teenage years, towards the \u2018end\u2019 of my disorder it was sometimes easier to not bother to try and speak than to go to the effort and become more anxious, HOWEVER the exhaustion was worth it to overcome the disorder.\nI always wanted to speak, and SM is the \u2018inability\u2019 to speak, choosing not to is technically not SM.\nSilence can be isolating and people can start to treat you as if you are stupid or invisible. \nSocial anxiety can also be isolating, even when not combined with SM and depression is complex.\nI would advise you to continue with treatment, sometimes to get better we have to do things we are uncomfortable with in order to feel better about similar situations in the future Your child years might be important to therapy I would imagine. SM is an inability to speak at all. That can leave you with a lot of frustration and anger. If you spoke to people especially new people it would not be SM. No expert here but it sounds like social anxiety on a potentially chronic level. That is still a big problem. \n\n\nYou are under severe pressure by the sounds of it and it will cause your more nightmares especially when you force yourself through jobs or higher education. \n\nSo continue the therapy for years if you need to.", "Recovery Has anyone \u201crecovered\u201d from this disorder? As in, made a complete opposite change from how they used to be? I was such a LOUD little kid. I have clear memories of meeting a very shy and quiet friend in 3rd grade and wanting to be like her. Since meeting her, I have had SM around my family (so for about 18 years of my life \ud83d\ude43). I am not necessarily outgoing around my friends or others, I am still shy, but I talk more to others than I have ever talked to my family and it hurts. It fucking sucks but I cannot change and do not know how to even start. I want to overcome this. I am about to get married and I am dreading it solely because of this disorder. \nPlease let me know if anyone has tips on how to help make a change.", "I am far from a perfect sister, daughter, niece, granddaughter, aunt, cousin, mother I feel like this mutism does not get any better over time I feel more and more mute. Like at parents night for my child\u2019s school it was exhausting and I flew out of there within the first half hour. I do not like talking and I feel comfortable with my folks. But if it is around my brothers,sisters ,nieces ,cousins grandma, aunts, uncles i do not talk. It is a form of disrespect in my Hispanic culture of not talking. Like you are offending them. If I could open my mouth I would. I cannot relay how much this hurts my soul. Why will not my mouth and brain connect. Just why? I feel for you lady. It sucks to watch my daughter struggle with Selective Mutism and it has got to be harder as an adult. I have never been diagnosed, &amp; quite possibly only had severe social anxiety, but I never talked at school. I still struggle at church and big events. Wanting so badly to respond, but not having the ability is torture. People lacking understanding to the cause is equally painful. \n\nOn a brighter note, have you checked out the resources on this sub? There is so much information that could change your life. I wish I had been apart of this group when I was still figuring things out. \n\nAnxiety likes to tell us that we are not good enough or do not deserve things. It also likes to point out \"reasons\" we cannot do things. For some, it also silences. You get to choose if anxiety wins.\n\nEdit: I do not think you can will out Selective Mutism and I hope that my words did not imply that you could. What I meant by \"letting anxiety win\" is not even looking into stuff, because professional help is not in the budget,  or being overwhelmed by the insurance process, or scared of exposure therapy. Those have been some of the challenges I have faced myself, and hope to inspire you to learn. That way you can see some improvements as you try to take some of the pressure off of yourself. I used to have selective mutism. Ik how you feel and Ik it is hard. But it does get better, I honestly cannot remember much of how I helped myself. I think it was by trying to talk to people more even if it is just one word. Just a simple yes or no. Ik that is hard. But just try to remind yourself this is not your fault. You do not want to \u201cignore people\u201d you are not. You do not want to make anyone upset you just feel like you cannot talk. Cause it is scary you just have to slowly get used to it. When I was younger I would only talk to people I was around regularly besides in school. I still have trouble talking in school to anyone. I still have a hard time talking to people about most things. It is hard to make decisions, hard to tell people how I feel but it is a lot better once you start to talk to people. It makes you feel less alone even tho sometimes being alone feels better. But I promise you, you got this you can get better. You are very capable. I believe in you. Ik if I can get through that anyone else can it do not matter your age or what you have. Is there any way you communicate besides talking? I used to draw and write if I wanted something. Even if the selective mutism never goes it can improve it just takes a lot of effort and time. It sucks Ik but you are strong Ik you are. Totally understand man. A huge part of my culture is respect and responding appropriately when talked to. I have been called rude and disrespectful for not responding. Some people assume I am mentally delayed and turn to my parents like \"she is not talking? Is she ..\" to which my parents say I am \"just shy\". Then comes in the huge lecture of \"You are 17, you cannot be this shy, it comes off as rude\" and I just want to sink through the ground and run away. \n\nThe older you get the more they come after you. I just want to tell you that yes, our cultures frown upon us and it gets harder as you grow up. Just know that NOTHING you are doing is disrespectful. I know that the more you hear these things the more it hurts and feels like 'maybe I am disrespectful...'. NO man. We are victims of a rare mental illness that is far from our control. Anxiety becomes disabling to the point where speaking is HARD. It is not your fault. It is the uneducated mess of people who do not understand us. You are NOT they problem, they are. &gt;: I do not think you can will out Selective Mutism \n\nI do not think so either and I am sick of trying.\n\nThe normals do not like what I say and they do not like what I do not say, so FUCK  THEM.\n\nOnline I can say anything I want, but IRL I am SOOO sick and tired of \"it\" happening--the \"autism moment,\" when everybody else is silent and I realized I fucked up again.\n\nFuck these people. If they do not like me being \"weird\" then I am not going to figure out what song and dance they want. If they want conversation, let them ask me questions. Other than that, fuck them and fuck talking to them. I think you can will away selective mutism but it gets exponentially harder the older you get. I am now 17yo and able to talk to someone if needed. I still struggle a lit with phone calls and having to talk in front of a group(if larger than ca.5(depending on who is in the group)). I \u201ebruteforced\u201c myself to talk when I was around 8 or 9 years old. That process took a long time because I started to talk to everyone of my class individually. sometimes starting to talk to a single person took over 6 hours without any breaks depending on the person. However I did not just do it out in the open, but rather invited them to visit me and we sat in a dark room together with my dad. I think the way I beat my SM was forcing my brain to forget that the other person was there and then to talk to my dad.\nIf today I would still be as strongly affected by SM I imagine it would be way harder to start talking.", "I used to have selective mutism I have had SM since I started nursery up until I was 11/12 when I transitioned into secondary school primary school was the hardest for me teachers dragged me out of lessons a lot and asked me why I never talked which was even worse especially (and I KNOW a lot of you can relate to this) when they would try and get you to talk in front of the whole class to \u201cget you out of your comfort zone\u201d this is my personal experience but for me it did not make things better it actually made it a lot worse and really did not help at all and i think they should know that the reason why I was able to get out of it was not because of their method but they actually made it a lot harder pressuring someone who has selective mutism is the one of the worst things you can do I never talked in school ever I constantly felt on edge all the time for hours everyday because of my anxiety I hated everything and I never felt understood. I think the problem is not enough people are familiar with it but it is a very serious mental illness and a very different approach should be taken. I really hope all of you who still suffer from it get the help you need from someone who specialises in that area and I will support you in every aspect of that your feelings matter they are heard and they are valid and I just want to say I am so sorry to anyone who has been through or is still going through it I really do understand first hand how difficult it is and how much is can destroy you you are so strong your hearts are honestly golden. \n\nAnyways back to where we were I can not tell you how much I wanted to get out of primary school I counted down days I dreaded being there all the time I especially hated lunch times unlike everyone else I remember getting picked on by this guy towards the end of my final year because he knew I would never say anything back. I am a really sensitive person so I had a lot of repressed anger inside of me because of everything which now I guess had a positive because it was because of all that and all the years I had to suffer constantly that I had the courage to step up for myself, and do that for myself no one else and do it because I was tired not because anyone pushed me to but because I knew I could not go another seven years like that and I would not do that to myself regardless of anyone which was actually VERY difficult at first but it is not something i would ever regret I really really made an effort to talk on the first day of secondary school and I kind of surprised myself aswell because I realised I smile a lot when I talk even now I am a really smiley person irl I see myself as someone is who is approachable and friendly!! I was still labelled the shy type for a few more years eventhough I really started to speak but it happened slowly and over time until I was able to talk at school so much more actually my friend at that time probably does not remember but once she told me I talk a lot which honestly is one of the best compliments I have ever gotten in my life because I never used to talk at all. After a while I realised I really like and enjoy talking to people in person a lot and I feel like I can be myself I can say doing that has been one of the best things I have ever done in my life I remember spending the whole summer leading up to that year worrying about what to say how to act how to present myself etc because this was my opportunity for change of course I was still quiet in the beginning but I got better. To be able to actually come to that point myself with no one\u2019s help and make that kind of life for myself is amazing really it is funny now because I have different problems and I go through different life experiences I still struggle with a generalised anxiety disorder and just got out of a really difficult episode I am actually in an argument with one of my friends currently which is funny because I never thought I would be in this position I feel free in expressing myself I do not hide anything now life has it is struggles but I think the love I have received from a lot of people whether that be online or in person and more so the ability to love is what has made me so much more confident and that could be a comfort person or a character for you that you love. I definitely am happier now life feels more beautiful and your life is worth living, anyways I am only posting this here in hopes to at least comfort one person I have never actually been to a therapist before but I do recommend it but make sure they specialise in SM and know that you have my compassion, my kindness, my support and my empathy this is your life and you are doing amazing you are special embrace it and do not let anyone make you think this is something that you can just get over it is not and if they do they are very insensitive and also very wrong no one deserves to go through this. Sending lots of love I wish I could help all of you one by one your pace is the only one that matters you deserve to be here Im going to senior year. One year left to leave the household that traumatized me so bad I got selective mutism. I want to try really hard to speak this year and this gives me hope. I support you and once you start to feel as though you can speak without fear it really does feel freeing and especially when you get out of your current household you are so close already your life has so much more to offer it changes a lot after that really I have a very similar story! I love hearing everyone is story dealing with SM because I always felt so isolated growing up. \nThe shift from middle school to high school was when I started talking to people and WOW how amazing it was! I was so proud of myself. And then my shift from HS to college was another huge leap in recovering from SM! Of course anxiety exists in some situations, but it is no longer crippling. Unfortunately, my body has not unlearned the not showing emotion part but I am working on it :) \nMy support goes out to all of you in whichever stage of SM you are in. For me, overcoming it being 18. It is the reaction from those I know if I do, that prevents me from overcoming it. I would be nervous in my self, but I feel if they did not react differently when suddenly I spoke, I could speak in a matter of one day.\n\nEdit: Also it was 6th grade for me where it really set in, I stopped talking....that was the year I should have started to talk more. If I was in my 18 year old mindset and not my 10 year old mindset, I would have. I can relate the reaction from other people was the biggest thing that held me back, when I did not talk everyone treated me as some sort of lab rat if that makes sense and I was always constantly asked why I never spoke ALL THE TIME and when I did they would give these really big reactions which was the part I hated the most. BUT I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS!!!! When you do start talking you do not actually get much of a reaction (comparing that to what I previously received when I did not speak) little to none tbh you will get those few people making a comment only when you start to but other than that it becomes normalised really quickly so everyone starts thinking of you in that way. \n\nWhen I did start secondary school there were two classmates I had previously known as they also went to the same primary school as me and 5 more of those were in the same year but I did not want them to be the thing that ruined my life further when I wanted to make that change for myself so bad I really did just say fuck it whatever happens happens I will deal with that later and gradually I started talking a lot more ofc a few of those classmates who I had previously known did say \u201cOmg it is so nice to hear you speak now\u201d in when I saw them once but that is it and then they moved on with their day and me talking just became normalised they probably forgot all about it so in our perspective our anxiety tricks us into thinking our worries are a lot bigger but in reality it is not like that I realised people dont actually care they have their own problems to worry about so I hope that is comforting! And you will feel so so so much better after it all even if it is the first week you just need to get past that and everything else will fall into place good luck and I support you! THANK YOU! I just wanted to know if I was alone or not, I am glad I actually came to this sub for once. That is what I figure, it could be as little as one bad day or a week. Which really I am not one who cares for people judging me about what I physically do, although I will avoid making too heavy of eye contact with anyone and look away, that is about it....so I guess that translates a bit.\n\nI think my cats helped me on that above aspect. I have also taken more into account the mindset, that we are all just brains floating in the air so that helps a bit.\n\nI guess I just need to start really, no offense to the people on here but I do not want to be in my 20s, let alone 30s with it....will I have tendencies, sure maybe whatever..... I was thinking today how my 8 year old self would be SO disappointed at my current self and that made me really upset, back then I could speak around the house normally, I have videos from 2011 where I had normal convos with my brother and it is like I do not even recognize that kid.\n\nIn a way too, I think I am scared to commit to the NEW life, you know? Because that is basically what I would be doing....but in the same way, I am scared to never grow from my current one and be stuck.\n\nEdit: And I guess yeah, the people you knew from school are really not that big of an issue, they do not know me that well like family does. In that sense. Even my extended family, so really it is my family I should be most worried about in my eyes. Change is always scary I felt the same way but you will never know how relieving it feels after you have gone through with it this is clearly tormenting you I remember going through years of that I never really had a proper childhood my teenage years were a lot better after though so I guess it makes up for it even my own mom who always tried to make me say something on the playground when she picked me up did not think too much of it when I did start speaking she was just glad. People have so so so much more of a reaction when you do not speak vs the little they have at the beginning when you do start to consistently. You deserve to live your life another person\u2019s second of thought is not worth suffering for that is what I came to realise", "Teacher wants me to present, but I am terrified. What should I do? Context: I am in high school (it is actually my final year, and I will hopefully be graduating in a few weeks). I have a final presentation for my English class, where I have to present my research for a project I have been working on since January.  I currently have a D in the class, so if I do not do well in this presentation, I will not graduate. I was originally going to opt-out, as I usually do, but she was adamant this time. She does not ask that I talk in front of everyone, but that I at least have a recording or method of verbal delivery of my content. I have just never given a presentation on my own before, and I am very embarrassed about my topic for my project, so I am getting a ton of anxiety thinking about the presentation.\n\nSide note: I am pretty sure my teacher is making me do the presentation because she does not like me. In the first semester of the year, she would go out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and that I did not do anything that might induce anxiety. At the time, that made me feel comfortable and I often also put in extra effort for my work. I had an A in the class. January came around and I was going strong until I was suddenly hit by a truckload of anxiety (I would say depression, but I have no diagnosis, so I will just say I lost all motivation and just was not myself). My teacher started greeting me with less enthusiasm, and I stopped doing work. By mid-March I pretty much did nothing at school. I barely managed to get by in other classes, but my English teacher's workload proved to be too much for me to bear. I turned in the work for the research project's final check-in a week after it was due. All students who turned their work in after the due date were supposed to be exempt from the regular presentations, which I expected I would be included in. However, she told me to do the regular presentations with everyone else. I feel like she is doing this to me because she does not like me anymore. But I dunno... What do you think?\n\nAnyway, I digress. What should I do about my presentation? I came up with three viable options:\n\n1. \"F\\*ck this\" version: I pretty much go up there and present a powerpoint that has all blank slides. I sit up there for 10-15 minutes (the required total presentation time) and sit up there in silence, as a form of protest of the situation I described in the above side note. I might play some Spongebob music (the kind that sounds awkward and is all instrumental) to fill the silence.\n2. \"I swear I am a good student, please do not hate me\" version: I ask a friend to narrate for me (I will record it, since none of my friends go to the same school as me), the powerpoint actually has a ton of effort put into it, and I get a decent grade for trying.\n3. \"I am going to cry\" version: I actually cry, I do not do the presentation, and have an anxiety attack in front of everyone. Teacher either apologizes or calls me a cop-out (which she has called me before).\n\nI feel like regardless of whether I choose 1 or 2, which are my top choices, option 3 will happen. For example, I had to present a mini-research project to my psychology class. However, I emailed my teacher and asked that I do not do it. Instead he offered to present for me. Although I was not the one who presented, having my work shown to the class sent me spiraling (I was trembling, numb, and nauseous). I am afraid that even if I just sit up there and do nothing, I will get a pretty bad anxiety attack.\n\nIf you guys have any other suggestions or tips, I would love to hear them! I am so sorry you are in this position... Fucking school...  No one understands SM ... Maybe your teacher is trying some 'tough love' and thinks the forced presentation is THE key to 'break you from your shell' ... if only selective mutism could go away with this 'miracle soluton' -\\_-  ... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there is absolutely no way you can get exempt from presenting (such as a therapists/doctors' note), I really do not think you should take the \"f\\*ck you\\* route because the only person you will be punishing is yourself, especially considering this is the only thing you need to graduate... basically 9-10 minutes of this torture vs. another year of this high school BS.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlay her game with the tools that are in your reach. Write down your whole speech and record it (you mentioned you even have a friend ready to do that!) . You even have the slides ready ! That is awesome . Another trick is maybe adding a video segment (like a video on youtube as an 'example' for your content) which will waste even more time if you have 9/10 minutes to fill in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile you are preparing your presentation, try not to fixate on the presentation class itself. Focus on your material and content. The first few presentations I had to do were pure mental torture and kept me awake days in advance no matter how well i knew my text and had rehearsed... What helped alleviate some pressure per say was 'accepting' that I had already fucked up and failed (even though in reality it was far from the case. my SM came from intense fear of failure and fear of rejection). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I recommend you actually do the presentation and read from your script even if it means having your eyes glued to the paper... If you go to uni, there will probably be other presentations to do ... The first one is always the worst, so might as well do it now and get it over with. You are so close to finishing school and never seeing the majority of these people again SM is often viewed as defiance. There is no reason to give them more reason to think you are willingly being so. You are right :') I was not thinking straight when I considered the \"F*ck you\" route. I really hate to do this, but I really have no other choice but to present. It is either 10 mins of that, or I fail and have to take summer classes. That will only put me off when I already enrolled in college :')\n\nI do not think I can speak in front of everyone, so I will stick with recording a friend reading my speech. Luckily, I already started working on the presentation anyway, and only have to finish writing my speech. \n\nThanks for this. I really needed to hear all of this. I will focus on my goal, and do everything I can to make sure this presentation goes smoothly. You are right. I never considered this when I was originally writing this post. While it would have been nice to do this if I had a good grade in the class (if I still had that A my grade would probably go down to an A- or B+ if I did the \"f*ck this\" version), in the end, regardless of grade, I should not put myself in a worse position as a student and person. Thank you for your help!", "My voice does not feel like it is mine So i had selective mutism since I was 3. Around high school, my parents sort of force me to talk to others. I never felt comfortable doing that but I did not had a choice.\n\nNow I am in college taking mostly online classes but even the classes I go in person, I do not talk at all. \n\nMy roomates think I am weird for being super quite, I told one of them that I had SM but she thought it had something to do with my voicebox instead of anxiety.\n\nWhenever I talk to myself (which is what I mostly do now) it just does not feel like it is my own voice coming out of me. My head voice sounds so different and I do not know if it is just me.", "Advice for Parent of Child Diagnoses with SM I first want to say how glad I was to find this subreddit. My son was offically diagnosed with  SM last yeat while in preschool. He has been in treatment for a few months and we have not seen a lot of progress (he still will not talk to the counselor). This makes my husband and I feel a little discouraged at times but, we remain positive and diligent with his treatment. We are nervous because he is starting Kindergarten next week and know he wont talk to his teachers. \nI wanted to ask adults thay have SM what you wished (or liked) that your parents or teachers did to support you?\nThank you! What I have always found helpful is people being persistent (but not pushy) with trying to talk to me. I have problems trusting people, so some gentle coercion and enthusiasm until I warm up to someone is essential to getting me to be comfortable talking. \n\nAs I have gotten older, I have also discovered that I am much more confident in familiar situations. I have even gotten to the point where I can make small talk with certain acquaintances. \n\nIt is also important to inform teachers that they should not take your son's silence personally if he warms up to certain teachers and not others. \n\nAnd finally, it is important that nobody tries to pressure him into speaking or makes him feel upset that he cannot speak. My mom always brushed my SM off as me being shy, but when I got older and it became inconvenient, she would yell at me for it. She also had me put in choir with a teacher that yelled at me for being too quiet/shy. Pressure like that is detrimental to self esteem, and worsens the condition a lot (this was the only time in my life I suffered from panic attacks). \n\nSM is difficult, but do not stop being optimistic and patient! It is the best case scenario that you guys caught it so early. It might be helpful to do some research on SM and social anxiety as well. \n\nGood luck! Your kid will appreciate you guys being so supportive. Not exactly answering your question but play therapy has shown some promise with our preschooler. Actually it could give teachers strategies for helping your child with playing and communicating with peers and the teacher. The psychologist even did a crash course session to teach us how to do it so we can do it regularly at home. Maybe you could see if a teacher would be willing to be trained in that area. Got diagnosed at about 4 - one year before kindergarten and got put in therapy really fast\nGet him some self-esteem therapy! Helped me alot, solely for boosting my courage and strength (I can remember a woman putting me on a small box and saying that i shall stand on it, if i get down, ill have to get back on the box. She would push me off the box, which was like 10cm tall, so no big deal. I would go back on, she would push me bacl down. This taught me at least to stand up for myself)\n\nWhen he achieves something, treat him with something (it was often video games for me)\n\nTry to encourage him to make friends in kindergarten, they have helped me a lot.\n\nPlease PLEASE be patient. It will probably take some time (the progress is quite slow). I was in therapy until third or fourth grade or so, but the journey didnt end there.\nI personally had unusual temper tantrums, which can occur in SM. \n\nPush him to be social, dont brute force him to do anything, but socializing, though slow and hard, works wonders!\n\nBe there for him, encourage him, treat him when he does good and boost his confidence in himself\n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to DM me. Ill gladly talk about this further. I know how hard it is, but it is doable =) This is great!! We have been talking more about his confidence and ways to boost his self esteem. One thing he is good at is interacting with his peers and making friends so its good to know that helps. He also has some temper tantrums that his counselor is linked to his SM and anxiety.  Thank you so much for taking the time to reply! He actually is doing play therapy its really interesting i will definitely bring that up to his counselor and teacher! Thank you! I think teaching his grandparents and other family not to take hia silence so personally has been more difficult than teachers. \nIm so sorry you were put in that awful situation with being yelled at and forces into something like that. We definitely do not want to treat him like that! It is important to be patient. It takes a very long time for someone with SM to be able to speak to someone. I have seen my therapist for a year and I still have not uttered a word. What his therapist and teachers can do is to not ever pressure or bribe him to speak to them. It is also important that they are never visibly frustrated or upset when he does not speak to them. This will only make it worse. What they should do is ask yes/no questions that he would be able to respond to, rather than open ended questions. I would also talk to his teachers before school starts and make sure they know about his SM and how to interact with him. I always wished that teachers would help me progress and learn how to talk to other kids, rather than just leave me alone and not help at all. I do not like to be pushed too much to talk right away, rather I feel comfortable if I am pushed more slowly and gradually. One of my teachers last year let me practice my presentation with her, and when I had to do the presentation, she gave me around 10 seconds to start talking. These little things help a lot. But what does not help is when a teacher shoves me into a group of kids I have never even met before, and tells me to have a debate with them or I am getting a zero. Overall, if teachers knew what SM even is, it would of probably made my whole life easier XD\n It also helps me a lot when I become close to another kid in the class, because I feel more comfortable with their friends, and soon other kids in the class. This is not related to teachers or parents, but I wish I had a friend at school that understood that I have SM and would stick with me. That would really help me right now! So if your son can find a friend at school who understands his SM, trust me it will make his whole life better.\nAlso, I am very happy that you recognized your son has SM and are trying to get him treatment. I do not blame my parents at all for this, but sometimes I wish they got me treatment. Maybe I would not have any issues right now. But we cannot change the past.\nSo yeah, keep supporting your son! Do not push him too much at once, just little by little with things he is slightly comfortable with, and he will progress. Make sure his kindergarten teacher knows about his SM so they can help him, too. It will make him feel so much better, knowing that other people understand him.\n(I am not an adult btw, I am a teenager, but I am past the point of getting treatment anyway) I agree I think working with the teachers will be extremely helpful. He had a really close friend in preschool that would kind of be the middle man with communicating with his teachers which was helpful. Of course- I am glad to help! I understand why family would take his silence more personally, but I hope they can find it within themselves to understand the fear he goes through in social situations. \n\nI appreciate the concern, though I have really come a long way. I am glad if I can use my experiences to help someone else. \n\nAgain, it is a big and great first step for you and your husband to educate yourselves on how to help him. SM is hard to live with, but not impossible to overcome. Best wishes to your family! You are welcome!\nIm glad that you found out so early! My daughter was diagnosed with SM in Nursery School.  She completed Kindergarten this past  year.  We got my daughter an IEP so she gets counselling in school and she also has an outside Therapist.  After much debate we put her on a small dose of Zoloft to help with the anxiety.  She had a difficult time in the beginning of Kindergarten and she needed constant prompting.  As the year went on, she got more and more comfortable completing tasks and actually made some friends.  (She still has not spoken to any peers or teacher)  It is very important to have play dates outside of school with kids he shows an interest in. The teacher needs to be understand what SM is and be very patient.

They have no way of knowing if not. Most people do not want everyone around them to just give up on them and act like they do not exist instead of still saying things to them. Also completely avoiding any situations where you cannot talk will only make it worse I would think. they will probably just think im being stupid Fair enough, people do not always understand. I get how you feel though it stresses me out so much when people talk to me, especially when it is a question or they are pressuring me to respond. But if it is just like making a comment to me or saying hi and stuff like that I like that they are still trying to include me and acknowledge me. yeah makes sense tbh ahhhh this was me when i had sm ;-; i could talk to my parents, siblings, friends and classmates my age perfectly but never any adults like my teachers or even my parents friends Thanks ;-; take my upvote kind stranger I am kind of like this but people significantly younger than me are a lot harder to talk to than older people.

I have never recieved an official diagnosis, but from 1st through beginning 7th grade I pretty much displayed symptoms of it, being almost completely mute in school. I never talked to anyone (though I wanted to), with the exception of the teacher whenever they called on me, and I was extremely socially isolated, only talking to my parents. In the teacher's notes and whenever they would talk to my parents, some of them would ask if I had depression or had some kind of abuse, which I did not, and my parents would always dismiss it and say I am fine and only shy.\n\nOver the past year or two I have been slowly recovering from it and beginning to talk more and more because of gained confidence, especially over this school year, where I have gotten to a point of comfort where I can freely talk to most people. I have been experiencing other symptoms of neurodiversity (ADHD I believe) which I think I might have had all along, and might have been what triggered my selective mutism (and I have realised there were signs of it in early childhood too).\n\nMy parents do not really believe in mental illness or that anything's wrong with me, but I do not understand why they dismiss the possibility of it so quickly. When you guys had it in early childhood, what did your parents/teachers think and how long did it take to recieve help? Also, I have never talked to a school counselor before but do they deal with issues like this and is information I give them confidential?\n\nSide note: I do not know if this is worth mentioning but I know that my mom has Thought Disorder, which may be what I have? I only know of this because my dad told me.\n\nThanks in advance. When I suddenly stopped speaking in school I presume my parents immediately knew something was wrong. I was diagnosed fairly quickly at age 6 and I started receiving the first working treatment about 4 years later. Hi! im 14 too and i was diagnosed with selective mutism in primary school. My parents knew when i was in kindergarten that i had some kind of difficulty with talking to other's (my mom was a psychologist so she knew a bit about the subject) , and so i only went for about a month. But i was very young so they did not care that much about it, until i entered school and i absolutely did not talk. like not even to the teacher, and that is when they got me to see a psychologist and she diagnosed me with anxiety and selective mutism. so I am not really the good person to diagnose you but i think you should talk about it with someone if you still are inconfortable about it.\n\nanyways congrats on recovering, i know it can be difficult! and do not hesitate if you have other questions :) I have been selectively mute for as long as I can remember, but I am getting better. In kindergarten I had some problems with my teacher because she thought I was just being defiant when I did not speak. I had a psychiatrist talk to me and my mom when I was in either first or second grade. He told my mom he thinks I am selectively mute but my mom dismissed it because she thought it was just anxiety. I still got a therapist though and have had one since (not the same one obviously). When my mom finally decided that it was selective mutism, it was extremely liberating because I could finally put a name to it. I am in high school right now and the counselors will discuss this issue with me and counselors in middle school have too. I believe it should be confidential with a counselor but all of my counselors have discussed my mutism with my mom in the past because I have special accommodations and they need to have meetings often. But when I go to see the counselor for things unrelated to the meetings, they do not contact my mom. I think they only really tell parents if they believe you are in danger of being hurt or someone else is in danger. You should ask them not to disclose anything if you decide to discuss it with them. Hey i an 15 i have been diagnosed at age 14 but had it since i was 4\n\nSm doesnt just go away\nYou need a lot of therapy and shit\nI thibk that that you are really lucky or have something like extreme shyness", "How do I know if I have sm? I have not talked since Friday and the only time I talk its to my boyfriend but the only word I had spoken since Friday was yesterday and all I said was \"Done Driving\" when I speak to people...I talk like a toddler but even that makes me severely uncomfortable, I have talked to my boyfriend about it and he said it could be sm and he will support me 100%. I do not know if what is going on is a symptom for sm. Any help will be awesome! (I also have been getting worse anxiety if that matters and diagnosed with social and generalized anxiety.) If you think having a label would be helpful, you might as well assume you have SM to some degree. Even if you would not meet the diagnosis, if your anxiety and trouble communicating is similar enough to SM that SM treatment would help you, might as well treat it as SM. \n\nReddit rightfully is nervous about people diagnosing themselves, but if you think diagnosing yourself in your head (with a big grain of salt) will help you talk about your problems and seek help, by all means, say you have SM. There is also a big difference between saying \"I think I have SM and would like to talk to a therapist about it\" and \"I think I have ADHD and would like to get a prescription without ever having a formal diagnosis.\"\n\nSometimes talking about your symptoms can be a good thing though. If I had not mentioned in a single comment on a different subreddit that I only had one period every three months and that it was extremely painful, I would not have been able to confidently go to the OBGYN and say \"I think I have PCOS based on these symptoms, can I get screened please?\" I would still be worried that something was wrong with my body but be too scared and ashamed to seek help if it was not for other people telling me \"that is not normal, please go get it checked out.\" If your anxiety around speech is causing you distress, please seek professional help. \n\nSM is just one of many conditions that can cause difficulties with speaking. You can certainly reach out for empathy and support here, but a psychologist would probably be best placed to help you understand what is going on. I will bring it up to my counselor when I see her...I will have to write it down since talking is very uncomfortable and it makes me anxious. Depending where you are, a speech pathologist, occupational therapist or psychologist may make the diagnosis. It is often done using non spoken communication aides to assist you to answer questions. It is most frequently diagnosed in children and an adult parent or guardian will be involved - but there is diagnostic protocol for adults as well. That is a really good idea. \n\nAlso, do not worry if you do not get the specific label of Selective Mutism. Under the DSM5 it is still mostly considered a childhood disorder. But that does not mean what you are experiencing is not real or that you cannot get help. There is good evidence for therapies like CBT to help with anxiety. \n\nYou might also find this useful in the meantime: (", "why do people feel the need to act like this? I fucking hate everyone at this school. my sister just told me that everyone calls me 'quiet girl' at school. I already knew because people have called me it at school but to just have it confirmed for me is even worse. I have been crying for about 1 hour or so because of it as well. all that anyone ever says about me is \"why does not she speak?\" or \"she does not speak\". the only things people say to me are either trying to make me talk or asking me why I do not talk. I am fucking sick of it. I feel so fucking lonely. no one cares about me. id never be able to be friends with someone irl because I will not be able to fucking speak. no one wants to talk to someone who cannot speak back or cannot even communicate at all Does not this suck? You literally just described my life in a nutshell. People can be so immature when there is someone in their life who is the \u201cquiet girl\u201d or the \u201cshy girl\u201d. I honestly think those are offensive labels, because a lot of times these shy and quiet people could very likely have some sort of anxiety disorder such as SM! They are literally making fun of people who cannot help that they are a bit quieter or do not talk at all. Yup. I am 28 now but I remember being called \"mute button\" in school. Some guys would pretend to point a tv remote at me. It sucks. This was such a terrible way to live life, and I am sorry you are going through it. I am thinking myself about printing some information to hand to people if/when necessary. \n\nPS I remember crying at my 6th grade pool party after being voted \u201cQuiet As A Mouse.\u201d That is reality because that is your most prevalent trait. If you want to be known for something else then do something else. But that is the dilemma; you cannot. It is not people\u2019s fault for noticing a pattern. I was called the same thing, oh well. God that is so horrible. People used to do that to me as well. they say stuff like \"is your mic on mute or something?\" and they always think it is fucking hilarious I want to have some sympathy with people and understand that maybe talking and building rapport verbally is what makes them feel safe, but I will never really understand the rudeness and entitlement people show towards people who are quiet, let alone SM. I am sorry that happened to you. I had selective mutism as a kid and the phrase \"you are mumbling\" or \"SPEAK UP\" still makes me furious at 30.\n\n\nIt will get better. Not all people mature, but enough of them do to where you can associate with better people by choice who accept you and treat you with dignity and respect. Do not cry babe.  What doesnt kills you makes you stronger\ud83d\udcaa just ignore them.  That is what I did in school. Ignore and do not give it any attention. kids are mean and immature Saying ignore them is hard when you are in that situation, but also remember this\u2026. A bunch of those jerks are peaking now, like they will never go up from here. Feel sorry for them. You do not want to peak in High School. Losers peak in high school. High school is such a short time in your life when you get older. You are great the way you are.\n\nEdit: spelling Not to one up you but I was voted \"most quiet\" in my senior year yearbook. I think they made that category just for me. I wanted to die. Same thing happened to me. People would try to get me to talk, offering money, asking why I do not talk. But they got bored of it and left me alone I am sorry you are dealing with this. Kids (and people in general) can be so ignorant and mean! I do not have any great advice except to remind you that you are not alone no matter how alone you may feel. I went through the same thing in school. People called me a \u2018mute\u2019 to my face and would often ask if I even COULD talk. It is absolutely awful. Things will eventually get easier as you get older and the people around you mature.

I did not have any of these issues pre COVID19.\n\nI am not diagnosed with SM or hearing conditions. I know hearing and SM is unrelated. I plan getting it checked as soon as possible. It is so difficult to speak with face covering and I cannot hear myself. I also have difficulties speaking when I do not have face covering because of everyone else wears them. I communicates through writing, gesturing and sign language if they knows some. Speaking to shop employees, teachers, classmates etc. after everyone started hiding their face and I cannot comprehend what is being said makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable. Sometimes I cannot get words out. Not everyone are patient and are willingly to write to me. I am a visual person, so I am dependent on facial expression and body language to comprehend better.\n\nI speaks fine and effortlessly when people's faces are not covered, and with my family. I can speak on the phone and understand a lot if I put a lot of energy in it. But it requires full concentration and can be compared to running. I can keep an okay conversation with medical professionals if they adapt the communication. Talking to everyone else covered up and when outside in the public is so hard.\n\nI am not sure if I am on the wrong sub. Its hard to figure things out. I have definitely felt similar with this pandemic. I enjoy not having to talk to people in person as much, but it is a lot harder without seeing lips to understand people.", "First day of being mute I am on the autism spectrum. I am 21 years old. For the first time since last night I have been unable to speak. I can say a few select words. Boop and I love you. I do not know why. I do not know how long it will last but my gut tells me it is here to stay for a while. Does that make it more likely? Is it common to have a million reasons of wanting to speak again but being afraid to speak again? Also how do I tell my dad I cannot talk even when I want to? I also do not understand why this happened- it seems like it almost came out of no where. I had a very bad panic attack that left me froze and then since then I cannot talk anymore. But I do not feel panic anymore. Just anxiety over the fact that I cannot talk.\nEdit: I have a therapist I plan to speak to ASAP as well eh well speak to ish I guess depending on how this goes Even if you cannot speak, you can still communicate.  Use the written/typed word to communicate with your dad.  Tell him what you are going through and it is confusing, and making you anxious.\n\nWhile I have only had a few panic attacks, I get panic attack hangovers.  I cannot say it is affected my communication, but the burnout is real.  Good luck, and I hope your therapist can help. I mean less so how literally and how do I explain. I already texted him how I felt but he keeps telling me I can talk. And thank you I hope so too :) but yeah I have been using text and text to speech to talk to my friends and mom &gt;even though you cannot speak, you can still communicate\n\nThat is not true for everyone who has SM. It affects both verbal and nonverbal communication Could explaining what selective mutism is help? Explain the science that causes it. Something along the lines of \" This thing I am experiencing is called selective mutism. It is caused by the fear response shutting down various unnecessary skills in order to survive the situation. One of those skills is communication, and it can be partially stuck shut for a while after. This means I can communicate through text, but am unable to speak.\" I will give that a shot. This is a good explanation too I realize that, but even if OP copied what they wrote above and sent it to their dad, it would be effective communication. I am so sorry to hear that, jeez. You are doing the best you can. Oof, sorry this is happening. Do not hesitate to use AAC like: sign language, texting, or TTS. I am a part-time/verbal autistic AAC user and it is great to have different options for different scenarios. Got To feel empowered in it, because you are definitely not alone! This sounds really rough. I would definitely recommend trying to communicate with your therapist the best you can about what is occurring. If you can break out of this anxiety-induced speechlessness as soon as possible, it will not have the opportunity to become a rigid and difficult to change habit. It sounds like the fear around this speechlessness is making the anxiety worse and is probably making it harder to speak.\n\nThis sounds like more of an episode of severe anxiety than SM, but SM is an anxiety disorder, so you probably came to the right place for advice. SM is generally treated through a mix of CBT and exposure therapy. To oversimplify it, treatment involves challenging yourself in small ways until you eventually work your way up to speaking. An example of an exposure I did in treatment was writing questions to other people. If you want to get back to speaking, I would recommend you find small ways to step outside your comfort zone. Be compassionate with yourself and do whatever you can handle.\n\nI imagine that this worry that it might last forever is scary. I want you to know that you are not powerless and you can make choices that lead to speaking again. It might be difficult to get back to speaking, but living a life where you cannot speak is far more difficult in my experience. Good luck. Thank you this is a really well helpful and logically compiled response. I am actually already making progress. I can speak to my boyfriend, only him, I can speak to him small sentences slowly.

What in specific motivated you the absolute most?\n\nFor a month there, I was highly motivated because of a girl I met, but since it is been 2 months I have lost any shadow of my own hopes that anything would ever come of that. Therefore I have lost my motivation. I have come to my life's lowest point so far, which is today (or the 31st when this will be done being written), I was crying while eating, with my family there. I have given up trying to speak to my family, and have just shut my voice down more and more, I also have locked the door to the room I stay in for most of the day to keep everyone away from me. I know what I am doing is damaging to progress, but I have given up on it all (besides the light of that motivation to want change, I know is possible to have). I know if I have the kind of motivation I did, change is more than achievable.\n\nI went to try and pick-up food today for my family, which I have been able to do about 5 times before, I could not do it and had to go back home. The only \"progress\" the last month is based off my more and more noticeable 'detachment,' in general. I thought about what I would write in a suicide note today, and it just made me cry. As much as I want to persevere in the hopes of hope still, I want to write my peace and give full honesty to my thoughts and just leave everything. My days have progressively been worse and worse mentally.\n\nI was driving to my speech session today and was VERY VERY mad, I was driving way too recklessly, I normally drive around more, then turn back to go to the speech building but I stopped myself and just sat in the lot with the car off because I was just way too angry to keep driving. I was shaking a ton. Then of course I go inside the speech building only to find out my appointment was missed, so I walk out just almost distraught over it, and just drove keeping my anger in check, eventually getting home.\n\nI was very annoyed before this because my Mom was yelling over me not getting onto my College class which I thought was on Thursday (not tuesday), of course it was Tuesday and thursday...so I go to log on it and she has to go get my Dad to yell at my brother to come help me since....I am not capable clearly....I just want to be trusted to do shit on my own. And she was harassing me over my problems before Speech and I just do not want to talk about them and she wants to help my SM but has no regard to what it actually entails, as she thinks I should just be able to talk to her about my problems....that is not how it goes. There is no understanding and it pisses me off. For me, I was just tried of everything. I realized it was all in my head. If I can ignore my gut feeling to not speak, I can have easy interactions and lube more easily. It is hard to \"just do it\" but once you are in that head space, life becomes easier I am so sorry to hear you are going through that.. I would like to give you my perspective on things. I struggle alot with trying to express myself or talking to new people. It takes a great deal for me to express myself as I fear being judged or seen as \"broken\". The best thing that I found to be helpful in trying to \"break out of my shell\" so to speak is to distance myself from those who claim to want to help me but do the opposite, and to try and find a genuine support system. All it takes just one person who can give you reassurance and be honest and willing to help. I do not know your situation exactly, but if you ever need to talk or vent about anything please do not hesitate to send me a message here on reddit I am here because my son has Selective mutism. So much of what you have wrote mirror's how my son is feeling and going through.  Iiving with this has been devastating to him, and he too has suicidal thoughts. He is at the stage now where he can talk very quietly to a teacher he knows one to one. I think it helps to number how anxious situations are for you, any more than a 7 and avoid them if you can. My son has found an online community of gamers that play a video game together, he loves the game and really wanted to join the group, I encouraged him, supported him to join, told him not to tell them he had Selective mutism, he hardly spoke at first, but slowly made friends, and was able to show he was good at the game, members praised him, 1 year on, I can hear him laughing and having fun. I think  if there is something that you like, try to get involved in it, then your in a situation because you like it rather than having to do something, if that makes sense.  You are not alone, connect with people online so you have people to talk to who understand x Yes, it has been a while but gaming was probably the one place I spoke the most freely (besides really starting conversations...if I was left alone with someone it would get pretty quiet, unless I was with 1 of my 3 friends who helped to carry conversations with me previously). I just got really bored with gaming, as releases have gotten stale and friends have not been on as consistently. Though I do want to eventually buy an Xbox Series X and I am hoping certain games release for it from Rockstar's GTA Series (I played that game to no end from about 2013-2015). Every game I played was better with friends, and I miss it...admittedly now I have spurs of when I play on my games and when I do not. At the moment I have not played any games with my friends since Mid June, and I have gone on longer breaks before, on and off, for about the last 2 years. That is also the last time I hung out with them because they really only tend to invite me anywhere if I play consistently on Xbox with them, I set myself to be someone who is not reliable...since it is not that I did not want to go, but I am also someone who hates to say 'no' straight out....so I would always give non-answers...it was hard for me to ask, one time was asked through them face timing me, and they would always talk about that. They were always cool about it though.\n\nI hung out with them about 5 times from 2016-2019, always invited over Xbox to hangout, and that waas the in-person setting I spoke the most freely in...although when we played baseball I was not one to call out to them from the field, that was something I could not do. \n\nWhen I do go to back to gaming, I know in the past my parents would hear me talking and screaming, and cursing....one time I screamed the loudest in my life at my friends over Minecraft....this is 3am in the morning. It was good....but now I tend to have a hard time speaking up out of fear of being heard outside of my room, so I stay more quiet. Also I HATE my room, but that is for other reasons, so I avoid it...unless I REALLY want to play Xbox. When I get the new one, it is going into the room I am most comfortable in, my Den.\n\nI think in 7th grade was when I had the greatest chance to really break out of my shell socially since I found (a different group before the one I mention above)....we all hung out on the weekends religiously, and it was the most social me so far. I had a crush on a girl in my Art class and I was willing to speak...but I did not know what to say, and I was taking advice literally, from YouTube.....It said to ignore her, so I ignored her :I ......she ended up dating someone else, but I eventually was fine with that, there is nothing there anymore (been 5-6 years). Though that group fell out after 7th grade because they discovered what I was looking up on my phone...I was embarassed and ghosted them all. Eventually I would re-kindle but I said some things about a person in the group, regretted that.....but it would result in them kicking me from the party consistently....so I gave up on that group.\n\nI wa just thankful in 9th this kid who knew me from Baseball Camp befriended me, he knew about me previously and was in my Xbox live parties from time to time with my old group.....anyway, he thought I was funny for not talking in Baseball Camp, I am still friends with him now and someone I met through him, and another kid from Highschool.....though it is been 2months since I have talked with them. \n\nI want that Xbox Series X, maybe it will lead to hanging out more and that will lead to something else more. I want life, but I equally do not want life (in the philosophical way, there). It is hard because you feel like you are already at the end of your life, because if it continues down this path, I know where my life leads. It stays the same. I think that is my biggest fear is staying the same.\n\nRight now I just play Minecraft on my computer with random people but you get to know them, but it is really nothing more than a mutual relationship, since I run \"businesses\" in these Minecraft servers, I get crazy in the chat on minecraft....well at least until it gets too 1 on 1. That I have to work on. I also need a new computer (and I would use my own money since I have a lot saved), but it is not cheap at all....so I got to ask my Mom to buy that soon, because I really want it. My current one's mouse is all messed up (laptop), and the nw one has this fancy display and can run any game (if I wanted to)....anyway, that is me rn.\n\nI am more just moving along currently. Hoping for something. It is interesting to me how similar you are to my son in the way you think about situations.  His computer is a huge part of his life, he is now going to a disability college, as he has chronic pain too, he does not talk there, but enjoys some of the lessons.  He needs things to look forward to.  He needs to see himself in this world, see his future. It is very difficult for him to do that.  I talk to him everyday, laugh with him.  When he shuts himself away, does not talk to people online, does not go to college he gets worse, he feels depressed and suicidal. He is probably like you - someone who does not realise what a lovely, kind, articulate, funny person he is, he is struggling with life, and needs to appauled all the little hurdles he manages everyday.  Just keep going, because you never know what good things might be waiting for you.", "Selective Mutism means Autism? I am curious as to how many was diagnosed with Autism and treated via autism methods when it was really selective mutism. Has the autism treatments or therapies worked? We were told when my son was initially diagnosed with Autism that he would need 20-30 hrs of ABA therapy to fix him. What have been your experience as a parent or person with selective mutism and being labeled with autism and treated in that manner? I am probably not the best candidate for answering your question since I have never been officially diagnosed with Autism, but I am at least qualified enough (due to the fact that my SM is quite severe) to say that you cannot \"fix him\" with autism therapy. Why? -- Because trying to \"fix\" him is going to backfire on you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have studied Autism quite heavily (in order to get a handle on my own severe case of SM), and have found there is a pretty clear overlap between the two.  There is, however, a subtle difference between SM and what is traditionally considered \"Autism\" by doctors (and this subtle difference is why the traditional autism therapy likely will not work.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSM is something that can be worked around mentally by the patient (though it cannot be \"fixed\" in the traditional sense because SM is not entirely self-contained in the head -- unlike traditional Autism, there are external triggers for it). Autism, on the other hand, is something that is traditionally more or less biological and exists internally, which too cannot be \"fixed\" and can only be worked around (and only in some cases.)   \nWhat is considered \"Autistic\" varies because Autism presents itself in different ways. -- SM is probably one of the ways Autism presents itself, but as a \"less severe-looking\" version of the traditionally \"mute\" autistic person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSM is different for each person in exactly where and why it presents itself, but generally it presents itself around the teenage years through external stimuli and tends to get worse into adulthood.\n\nIn many cases, SM presents itself in people who appear to be holding themselves back from talking in various social situations for one reason or another. That is partially true, but it is likely a combination of the Asperger's aspect of not being able to \"recognize\" or \"respond\" naturally to social cues. This results in people with SM being forced to \"stay silent\" in certain (sometimes most) social situations where they are around new people or people they do not know very well.\n\nAlthough one can argue that people with SM can simply \"not care\" about what others think about them, there are other situations where \"not caring\" is not an option (such as with jobs/relationships/money) and they must be careful not to upset those situations by talking carelessly (and by \"carelessly\" I simply mean talking without being able to \"see\" or \"respond\" to the subtle reactions or emotions of others they are talking to and being forced to assume these things -- traits typically found in people with Aspergers.)\n\nMuch of this deep-seated \"fear\" comes from the inability to experience empathy due to Aspergers-like symptoms. One with Aspergers has a hard time recognizing subtle emotions in others. People with severe SM cannot do this very well, so they opt, instead, to simply be \"mute\" and avoid any social repercussions from it. Since Aspergers is a form of Autism, it is likely the two are heavily-related to why SM presents itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is more than social anxiety (as people with SM can thrive in certain social situations) -- and it is more than being unable to be empathetic (as people with SM can and do care about others, but being unable to \"read\" the emotions of others makes it hard to show empathy sincerely, which, again, makes it difficult to choose communication over silence.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this helps you (or anyone) in trying to understand what this is and why it is difficult to \"fix\" in a person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Totally appreciate your response. I am not trying to \u201cfix\u201d him but trying to find the best method to help him overcome his SM. It is frustrating to hear someone tell you that this what you need to \u201cfix\u201d your child. He has a rare genetic disorder called OCNDS which cause developmental delays but aside from that he communicates to us as best as he could at home and in public but only to us. Every now and then while at the playground he will attempt to speak another he I think he feels comfortable with but it is not an full blown conversation. Maybe a quick question or pointing to something. Unfortunately I am not there to witness it or it has been recorded. That is good to hear. There are plenty of \"parents\" who really think it is possible to \"fix\" these kinds of children when, really, they are just wired differently from others. And, aside from obvious social issues, they can usually get along fairly normally otherwise. That is why I can totally relate to the frustration you felt about someone telling you the steps to take \"fix\" him -- there is no known \"fix\" for autism to begin with, but being so damn presumptuous about it being a surefire \"fix\" for your specific child is ludicrous to me.\n\nAnyway, it is interesting to hear about OCNDS at least, as I have never come across it before. Considering it was just established in 2016, I wonder how rare the disorder really is. Many of those symptoms I have had personally, but as far as I know, aside from heartburn as a kid and some cavities, I have not dealt with any physical deformities or muscle issues, so maybe I am in the clear to some extent. The inability to talk of course is one I have definitely experienced.\n\nThere was a point I remember in my very early childhood (probably around 3.5 years old) when I actually made the decision to say my first words to my family. They did not even think I could speak, though I knew enough that I could easily speak full sentences about anything I wanted to. The issue was that I enjoyed observing more than talking and almost made the decision to keep silent for as long as I could because it was simply more interesting to watch and learn when everyone forgets you exist. I remember speaking for the first time for the sole reason that I wanted to show up my aunt who did not think I could speak or understand what she was saying. Had it not been for that, I probably would not have said anything for another year, and I would have been perfectly content.\n\nSome people simply do not feel the need to talk. I am not sure how old your son is, but it will take more than being around strangers for him to really become comfortable. I know that even today I still prefer one on one conversations with people I could trust with my life, but anyone else involved that I trust even just a tiny bit less, and I shut down again. Trust is the key issue for me.\n\nMy mother had left me alone in a motel room when I was a baby and I experienced a lot of moments alone throughout my life, so maybe this has something to do with my lack of trust, but I have found that I need an unusually high level of trust and warmth in a person before I will communicate more than a couple of words or a question to them.\n\nHas your son ever experienced some traumatic or lonely event where he perceived someone he counted on not being around for him at some point when he really needed them? I am not sure but this could be part of the SM's earliest beginnings. In my case, my grandparents got custody of me and I learned it was safe to come out of my shell a bit. It helped me to realize that I could be visible without being afraid of those around me.\n\nSorry for the length of this, but I thought maybe sharing some of my experiences might at least give you a different angle to work from. Maybe this can help point the compass a little closer to North for you... He is about to be 5. The disorder was found in around April of 2016 and he was tested in June of 2016. At the time there was nothing to go on other than he had a micro deletion of chromosome 20p13. A year later we met with a geneticist for the first time when we got back from overseas and he could only find the initial study and was not too sure if our son\u2019s case was related as it was only girls the study was conducted on. Found a FB group of a few people and immediately the geneticist reached out to us and we officially had a diagnosis for it earlier this year. There is about 2 known cases in Brazil, a few in the UK and Netherlands and several dotted throughout the US. At our initial family conference last month, about 43 kids ranging from 2-18 was tested, 41 had a mutation and 2 had a deletion. My son is one of the two with a deletion. Severity was all over the place as neither one child was the same but the underlying connection was developmental delays. He is never alone, my wife is a stay at home mom, he has two older brothers who are home schooled and a younger sister. He has some anxiety over certain situations but typically does not freak unless it is a dog trying to dog at him. He is  always playing with his siblings or me or goes to his therapist for OT/PT and speech. But he whispers to his therapist or points and that is after a year and a half of seeing her. She had recommended a SM specialist as well and we have been pushing for one. Problem is, there are not any locally and the nearest is 3:30 hrs away from us and not accepting new patients even for evaluation. One hospital was not sure about helping him because of the OCNDS diagnosis. After reading through that, it really does sound like trust is the major issue. A therapist (even going to one for a year, which I did when I was removed from my mother's house a second time) was not able to break through to me to get me to talk. Even if it is a \"relaxed\" environment, there are still tiny cues everywhere (i.e. the clipboard/binder and note-taking) that you are not \"with family\" and it is hard to break away from that in such an environment.\n\nThe other issue I see could be a potential factor is that talking is actually mentally \"hard\" on the brain and can be draining to a person. Most people do not realize it, but if one thinks and talks at the same time, it is harder to talk. It may be that he simply does not prefer to do it unless he is excited (and maybe not even not that much then.) In my particular case, I have never \"liked\" talking in any form. It is very draining on me. I am more of a visual/experiential sort of person than a \"labeler\" or even a \"thinker\" -- I prefer to observe, but without bias, so I can see all of what is going on in the world (when you are thinking or talking, you \"miss\" certain things), and I have been like this since before I can remember (and I can remember back to when I was 3, though there are glimpses of my 1-2 year old experiences too, such as my mom giving me a bath in the kitchen sink -- I can even remember the \"hooked\" faucet of that sink and the medium-brown paneling on the wall in the trailer at the time. This was mostly because I was scared at that time of drowning and it sparked some hyper-awareness that made that particular memory stick. However, this \"awareness\" has stuck around and causes me to think and process more than I probably ought to in day to day life. This affects my ability to \"converse\" with others even now. A \"conversation\" lasting more than about 2-3 minutes with any given person (even people I really like) can exhaust me because I have to think a lot about how to actually interact with them. There are a few friends (who I know will not judge me or anything I say or do) that I can talk about topics that I do not even have to think about to keep up my end of the conversation, and these are the people I can feel comfortable around enough to have a legitimate rapport with because they do not feel like I am having trouble remembering how to communicate with them -- it all comes naturally, and I usually do not want to stop talking to them.\n\nHaving a 6 year old son of my own (who is ridiculously talkative -- to the point where he talks to himself just to work out all the things going on in his mind), I know that being the parent puts you at a disadvantage to being \"the one\" your child talks to about issues that are on his mind, but building that trust in the same way his grandparents did is probably your best option if you can manage it somehow. You might have to give up your principles about being an \"authoritarian\" as a father (assuming that is the role you play), because this comes across to children as you being distant and mysterious and does the opposite of making them trust you enough to talk to them. Yes, this works for punishment well (at first), but after a while, you will realize that trusting them to do the right things (and not \"beating them up\" when they make mistakes while also making them aware you know they made a mistake, but you also know they can do tons better) -- this can go for miles with their trust, and is the \"secret\" my grandmother used when raising my hard-headed self. She was never in the middle of things, but she was always available as long as I did the right thing, and welcomed me with open-arms when I chose that option on my own (even after being stubborn.) I have been trying this with my son lately and it really does work. Kids can resent their parents for the weirdest things, so it is our job to make them feel comfortable enough to talk to us above all others -- not theirs.\n\nAnyway, developmental stuff can come from any angle, and that gene deletion might not be enough to point out the \"correct\" therapy for your son -- but, as we have been doing for centuries as humans before we had all of this fancy genetic testing (that is not always as certain about the \"whys\" as it sometimes tries to sound), we treat our children with love and offer them a place to go that they can always trust will be there for them, while using that trust in us to guide them to our vision of what a \"better life\" looks like for them... But we, as parents, should never forget that these little people are not US, but their own little person, and that person could be very different to the kinds of things they need in this world than the things we want for them to have, so keep that in mind as you watch and learn from them -- you have to ask questions that your children may not even know how to verbalize the answers for -- but those questions are still necessary, even at 5 years old, to understand how they experience the world. If you do not ask THEM how they experience the world and what things bother them or make them happy, then no matter how many doctors, geneticists, or therapists you talk to -- how in the world do you really know?\n\nIn my case, I wished somebody had asked me what things had been bothering me. What things make me not want to speak to the world. Had somebody done that then, when I was young, I would not have to reverse-engineer myself all these years later and struggle to find the answers I need -- I would have been able to see the things that showed me it was actually alright to talk openly, assuming I had guidance from others who were able to show me how and why it was okay. They would have understood my fears a little more, and as such, I would have too. This might not make it any less draining to talk, but it would at least bring down some of my anxiety before it got to be as unbearable as it is now.\n\nJust food for thought.\n\nGood luck with your son though -- I really hope things work out for the best. I know life can be a pain for us as the parents sometimes, but we have always got to remember that they did not ask to be born into this world, nor did they ask for the pain or fears we (even indirectly or inadvertently) put them through in their time here in this world. It is our responsibility to do for them what we can -- and learn how to deal with the things we cannot so that we can one day apologize to them for those things we lack. We gave them life, sure, but it is them who have to live it. \n\nI am glad to see you guys doing your best to figure this thing out, and I hope I might have helped offer some insight, even if it is only a drop in the bucket of what you probably needed.\n\nI do wish you all the best though -- so good luck! **Selective Mutism** *is a Society Anxiety Disorder included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and is often misdiagnosed as Autism.* However, some of the **characteristics appear to mimic the Autistic behaviors**.\n\nIt portrays a constant downgrade in the confidence to converse, usually in the school. Other signs, you can notice is that individuals may avoid interaction or have minimal eye contact, remaining expressionless or not responding.\n\nShyness and nervousness in their voice also play a significant role in the associated behavioral symptoms.\n\nPrior to making any diagnosis, teachers or therapists should ask family members about the child\u2019s behavior while talking at home or anywhere else.\n\n&gt;*\u2018We were told when my son was initially diagnosed with Autism that he would need 20-30 hrs of ABA therapy to fix him.\u2019*\n\n***ABA Therapy***, a short form of ***Applied Behavior Analysis Therapy*** is a widely known and most effective scientific discipline based on behaviorist theories.

Autism is not a machine which will require a fix to something, but ( require a broad understanding of the scientific field of behavior analysis for autism.\n\nThis therapy puts the main focus on improving definite behaviors, such as social skills, communication, reading, adaptive learning skills, hygiene, grooming, punctuality and job competence in ***special needs education.***", "What is the difference between SM and shyness?  Essentially, shyness is a personality trait. People who are shy may not speak that much in school for example, but when they *need* to speak they easily can. People who are shy are functional, whereas selective mutism causes the person to struggle with that. \n\nSelective mutism is considered a severe anxiety disorder, and it usually presents as being able to talk freely at home and being unable to speak in other social settings. When prompted to speak, they become completely frozen and are unable to respond or say anything. Sometimes people with SM struggle to communicate nonverbally as well. Essentially this, there are generally no clear lines or definitions when it comes to mental or personality disorders, it is a matter of being *functional* or not. That in itself can be difficult to define sometimes but if a personality trait becomes so strong that it is affecting one's life in negative ways, then it is a disorder Simplest way for me to understand it for my child was, choice. Shy kids usually choose not to talk or prefer to listen, but when prompted can speak. SM kids once the anxiety takes over that is that, no amount of want or need will make it happen. They will get frustrated because they want to talk and cant. Im reading this book right now called Beyond Shyness by psychotherapist Jonathan Berent. He is appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, CNN Medical News and a lot more. This book is all about the difference between common shyness and anxiety and how to conquer problems from mild shyness to crippling social phobias (which is where SM would fall). He states that research shows that 93% of all people experience shyness and has come to realize that this term is just too broad to be of any help in identifying a problem. The actual response to the stress of interaction is called social anxiety. There is a wide spectrum of social anxiety from mild nervousness all the way to social phobia, in which interaction related anxiety is so extreme that a person actually avoids the situations that cause it. In our case, not speaking. I am not sure about you but whenever I have been called \u201cshy\u201d it is always been in sort of a derogatory sense. He helps you not only accept your social anxiety, but learn from it and use it to help you master situations that feel the most difficult. I would suggest this book and his dvd series (there are 5 discs, 2 of which are dedicated entirely to SM) to anyone.", "Speech Therapy Helpful for You? Hello everyone :),\n\nI am a speech therapist and I have several students right now who have selective mutism.  I wanted to ask you a few questions:\n\n1. Did you receive speech therapy as a child?\n2. If so, for how long?\n3. Do you feel like it helped you? \n4. Which part of it helped you the most? \n5. What did it help you to be able to do?\n6. Speech therapy included (but also counseling, teachers, occupational therapy, or any other person/animal/activity in your life) what do you feel has helped you the most with managing your selective mutism so far?\n\nThank you in advance for any responses. :)  I appreciate your honesty and want to make sure I am helping these kids to accomplish something important to them in the ways that best help them. Edit: If you only feel like answering some of this (or none of this of course) :) that is totally cool.  I realize it is a lot of questions. I do not know that it would have helped me as a child, because even though my parents trained me to Proactively talk about issues at the Doctor, as a kid I did not see it as an issue, I saw it as not talking because I did not want to talk the majority of the time and only realized I was  unable to speak when put on the spot or public speaking situations.\n\nAs a teenager, I actively worked on it because it affected my ability to do something I wanted to do (get a job).\n\nI am in speech therapy due to vocal chord dysfunction from my hEDS and csf leak which does make speaking difficult. Others here have a lot more valuable insight to give, but these are my tips. No one in my life thought that my muteness was an issue (I was a good kid who did well in school and was overlooked because I did not make a lot of fuss or trouble). I never received any childhood intervention. Now I have to navigate having sm as an adult. If I had gotten treatment the most important thing would be feeling safe and heard. I would need someone to take the time to slowly build trust without getting frustrated at how long it takes. One on one would be best. I was a very smart child and was offended when adults talked down to me. Your kids are intelligent, funny, creative people they just have an intense fear of speaking. Remember it is an anxiety, we are not being difficult, moody, or defiant. I am not sure if speech therapy would of helped me. Play therapy for my anxiety probably would have been more beneficial. Any ways those are my experiences and thoughts. I went to speech therapy in school for a couple of years, I think. I must have been 5-7. I remember hating it because she made me talk and would never accept silence. It felt like torture at the time. I had very slight speech issues that I kind of seemed to grow out of.\n\nI did not really have help managing SM. Finally entering college helped because no one there would be shocked if I talked, so I just tried to force myself to do it.", "Sharing my experiences. I feel like SM never left. Hey everyone,\n\nAccording to my mom, selective mutism kicked in for me on the day my little sister was born (around age 3/4). I have been struggling all my life (27 now). In places I feel uncomfortable, I still speak with a softer voice and keep my sentences short (sometimes even stuttering). As a kid, besides being mute, I was also very passive in my movements. I would be afraid to stand up to pick a new book in class. I always called it a curse, making me unable to speak. \n\nI remember stories of primary school teachers being embarrassed to have forgotten to take me back inside after breaks. I have learned to talk with therapy on a special school.\nOnce I left that special school, everything went downhill. I got bullied a lot. Classmates would keep overthrowing me with questions until I started crying, after which they suddenly started acting all nice. It happened a lot.\nAfter that I had to move to a place for people with autism (my mom's ex insisted I moved out, he did not understand/hated me so I did not feel safe at home either). Ever since, I have lived with people with autism. I never felt like I belonged there. I know I have communication problems, but I always felt different. I just could not talk.\nAt some point, a year or two after Pokemon Go came out, I came across a group of players in my town. I worked up the courage to ask them about the group, and joined their community. I could finally be myself and talk normally to them! For about a year I would been the happiest I ever was, cycling around, talking to them and finding my bf.\nDue to issues where I lived, I later moved in with my bf and his parents until we found a place for ourselves. I was adjusting to living there, when covid hit and everyone stayed at home. I was always afraid to be too \"visible\" and to talk much, I stayed in my room as much as possible. So I always worried that the parents did not like me. At the same time I would been job hunting with a jobcoach, so once covid restrictions got lifted I got invited to some interviews. I felt like the interviews were not going so bad, not until recently I realized I must still have seemed too \"passive\" and/or quiet to them.\n\nCurrently I am looking for a place to live for my own again (I have moved every year the past ~5 years) and accepted a contract offer in the cafe I have been \"working\" for a few years. It is the last place I have been with assisted living. I have never felt comfortable with the assisted living places, so here too I still use my \"soft voice\". The whole reason I was looking for another job, was to separate myself from those places. Pokemon Go made me realise I actually could be able to talk normally to other people.\n\nAnd only recently, I got spammed online by the anime \"Komi cannot communicate\". I had to look it up, I had to search if it is actually about SM and I watched the first episode crying. Everything is so familliar, and many bits even equal to my experiences. I remembered it is why I have trouble communicating. I can talk now, but it is still chasing me. Sometimes when I go home from work I cry from the mental exhaustion. Sometimes I have a good day and forget all about it. Sometimes I hear people talking about stuff I like and I cannot join in. Sometimes I have conversations that make me happy. Sometimes I stay mute and get angry inside. After all this time I am so scared it will still hold me back in the future.\n\nThanks to Komi, I found out about this subreddit. It is tough out there, but now I know I am not alone and I wish everyone with the same condition to lead a good life, mute or not. You are fine the way you are! So happy they made it into an anime Could you expand a bit on your work troubles? What are you doing now to bust out of your shell? Thanks for sharing your experiences. I can somewhat relate. I always enjoy reading about adults who had SM as a kid, because I can always relate on some level.  Makes me feel like, \u201chey, I am not alone!\u201d  I posted about my experiences here, if you are interested: \n\n The place I work now started as a quiet cafe for cyclists, not a lot to do early on beside bake walnut cakes and think of lunches. It was also the place where the people living in the assisted living community got a chance to help out and help with their day rhythm. \n\nIt is gotten a pretty popular place for cyclists and tourists to grab a snack and/or lunch by now, so recently they started actual working contracts for most of us there. Since it got busier it also  got more chaotic, and at those moments I sometimes NEED to speak up if something is wrong or if I need something. Being forced in a natural way like this helps me a lot, even though I still only manage to do short sentences (I also always got along with talkative people because it is easier to talk back). I always hated using cards or fake conversations to practice, though that may just be me being  too stubborn. Natural feels good. They even want to put me behind the bar to serve coffee and drinks soon (step by step ofc) so that will be a good challenge.\n\nAs for the reasons I want to leave that community, the \"safe space\" they offer actually has a reverse effect on me. Always had. It feels like they are watching everything I do, them writing it all down (like they all do in assisted living situations or with people with autism). They also all seem to worship the founder of the organization, who often talks behind their own clients backs. Makes me insecure and it feels a bit toxic. So that is why I would been searching for something else, with no luck. It is funny to read how relatable things are with others. Though I do remember talking to kids my age, especially at the special school I went to. I have struggled a lot since middle school because of the bullying, even with people my age.\n\nAs for a therapist, I tried one myself because of depression but ended up with someone who only talked about himself (not that I minded, I had to talk less haha). So it did not work out. I guess it can be personal who can help but I hope you find the right therapist! The SM never leaving paragraph hit me like a brick. I am nearly 21 now, I was forced into conversating at 12 and 16 (respective to different \"groups\" I did not talk to). I always thought I was stupid for thinking it never left me. Thank you for sharing. Okay, in a work place like that there are going to be lots of awkward social interactions that will probably get you over thinking. The trick there is to care as little as possible. Do not worry if you are fucking up or saying the wrong thing, just trust and do. Act. Let the pieces fall into place on their own. \n\nYou fall short of perfection you will still land closer than most.\n\nExtra scrutiny wont help either. Your overall aim should be to rewire your brain to stop seeing things as life and death first, and then situations as fundamentaly negative second. Do not assume negatives and leam towards positive assumptions. \n\nWhat I can see works is consistent socializing. That means just diving straight in; immersion. It cannot be infrequent because you will just beat yourself up remember how awful it was the next time. You need to not allow yourself time to even bother considering your mistakes. You say you have difficulty when you need to be loud. So be uncomfortably loud. Free yourself from consequences and judgements. You are struggling to open the faucet just.... enough to pour yourself a glass of water, you need to open it up full blast 'til it is spraying all over the kitchen. \n\nHope something I said helps. Thank you!  I actually started seeing a therapist recently. It is been fine so far, but I have only had a few sessions so far. Hopefully, it continues to go well. Thank you for the advice. As an old friend used to tell me, \"life get a lot easier once you stop giving a 'fudge' \". I did experience that during my Pokemon Go time, I did not care about anything anymore. Yet still that SM switch went off at work when it came to talking. I will keep trying to push myself over the edge and to surround myself with people. I am already talking a lot more and easier compared to when I started living/working with these people (5ish years ago) so it is slowly going better. I hope so too! Good luck on your sessions. :) Getting forced always made it worse for me. For a big part I got used to it, I am who I am and it is fine. But there are always off days/weeks.\n\nLike a two weeks ago, I often go to a hobby store with people that are very easy to talk to. When I went alone that time, I could not say anything. I barely could make up a sentence (it was right around looking up the anime and it is relation to SM, so I was feeling a little depressed). When I went last week I talked about my crafts and the guy remembered what I bought to make it and the conversation kept rolling. \n\nIt is fine to feel down for a bit, maybe even cry. But do not stop trying and finding the right people you feel good with. It can help a lot. Same! I have been scared to watch more after the first episode though. \nAlso been wondering if I should make a post on social media so people around me understand better. Can i say first of all, the komi cant communicate series/ books are amazing i literally have 14 of the manga komi cant communicate books I am super addicted I am so glad other people with sm relate to this like i do \ud83d\ude01\n\nHonestly though, I think you need a break, and by that i mean a get away. Go to like a hotel or do some meditation and clear your mind. Maybe even therapy? I know that it sounds all to easy but honestly it makes the best difference ever!\n\n2. get another job, maybe this is what is holding you back? I know me typing this sounds easy and all but it will be challenging but go for it, we only have 1 life. Give yourself time and work on your selective mutism. Please remember to be proud of yourself because you deserve to be proud!\n\n3. Be yourself. :) I do need a break and time for myself. It is why I have been looking for a place to live on my own again. Sadly I cannot afford to go on a trip because I have spent way too much money this year. But finding a new place to live (alone, without bf) will help me get my indepence and hopefully confidence back. It will also give me room to relax more (sometimes hard when living with clingy bf). \nFinding a new job has been rough, especially with covid and the few interviews I did, did not go great. Which is why I for now accepted a contract where I currently work. I will keep looking around though! \n\nI will get there! :D Im sure you will! \n\nAlso nature walks are a brilliant idea to take a break :)", "/r/selectivemutism wiki updates and expansion \n\n(\n\nAs far as I know, I am the only one writing it.

Also, there are quite a few talks about autism and other disorders being linked.

Is anyone else struggling with the sudden shift to everything being done over the phone?\n\nI had a tele appointment with the doctor this morning and managed, but when I went to get my meds the prescription had not been sent. Lo and behold, I lost my voice. My husband called the clinic for me but they would not tell him anything beyond \"we will check.\" Never did get sent to the pharmacy, and now the clinic and pharmacy are both closed until Monday, so I am going to run out of meds.\n\nMeanwhile I tried to sort it out but the clinic thought my unintelligible stuttering was a crisis and did everything like I was a danger to myself, and basically ignored me when they realized I was not, told me my next appointment date, and hung up.\n\nIf I could have handed someone a freaking note I would have medication this weekend, but no one lets you inside. And I understand but why do not they have a way to text or email? And I will probably have to do the same exact crap on Monday to hopefully get it sorted. I can definitely relate to this. My biggest struggle is the fact that my schedule has been dumped upside and turned inside out. Having a schedule really helped with my anxiety, and I do better with one overall. Now that I am recovered, phone calls are not as difficult, but it is still not ideal. \n\nThis whole situation is just...frustrating. Never would I have seen this coming It is so frustrating when you have got to speak to people through the phone. Your voice just gets stuck and it is so embarrassing. I hope this Covid thing ends soon and that your situation gets better, you can do this!\ud83d\ude01 I agree \nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to work through this Could you have a conference call when you call the clinic? Put your phone on speaker mode and have your husband do the talking. Have sentences that you want to say written down and hopefully you can say them, maybe even randomly interject. Have your husband explain SM first thing on the call. Have him ask for a text or video option to communicate. If they agree to video, have your paper ready to hold up to the camera. You may not have to speak at all. Good luck. I am sorry you have run out of meds. In Canada, pharmacists are allowed to dispense emergency meds without a prescription to fill gaps. Thanks for the ideas! I will see if it is doable. It is complicated by the clinic hours and my husband physically being at work (do not even get me started on that bullshit), so video is probably out. But a 3 way conference call might work.", "My sister might have selective mutism? My sister is 14. She is nearly at the end of year 9 and we have started getting phone calls home that she will not talk in class, and just mimes the words with no sound coming out. She is adamant that she is just too quiet for them to hear but even the kids next to her cannot hear anything. The school have suggested that it could be selective mutism. She is never has any problems before and has not had any trauma so no one really knows why this has come on.\nDoes anyone have a similar experience? Well you do not need any trauma to have an anxiety disorder etc. And you cannot really know if she has had problems before because communication is so hard at that age, at least it was for me. I do wonder if everything's ok at school, like is there bullying. Hope she feels safe telling you all if there is a reason she is being so quiet, no judgement or blaming her. I know it does not have to be trauma, it is just somethong that was suggested online. I get it too, I hated talking in school and cus of covid I did not even have to do my speaking which I was so relieved about. I hope she is not being bullied aswell cus she is such a happy girl most of the time. She knows that there would be no judgement or anything we have just had some family issues that could be making it harder. Hopefully it is not that though, they are setting up some meeting so we should get to the bottom of it soon! hi, im a teen who has had selective mutism for most of my life and yes it does look like this is selective mutism, I would definately contact a doctor or gp about this as they can diagnose this. \n\nSelective mutism can be caused by lots of things not necessarily trauma. Many people with selective mutism also have anxiety and anxiety can be the most common cause even if its slight, mild or bad. Selective Mutism is most common in younger children but can come on at any point. \n\nMy advice would be having a talk with her about how she feels, it could be that she doesnt like the school or something like that which can be a cause too. It would be worth getting a doctors opinion, but to determine if she definitely has selective mutism it can take a while for some people but she can get the help she needs like counselling or something. If the school says she isnt talking still after a few weeks, it would be really necessary to take her to a doctor as this is serious.\n\nI hope this helps!! Thank you, we will definitely talk to her about it and see what she / doctors say if it does come to that. This reply really helped :) That Is ok! im so glad i can help :) \n\nIf your interested im going to be doing a q&amp;a about selective mutism and anxiety on my page i dont know if this could be any use to you but i thought to let you know! \n\n:D I will definitely have a look!! Thank you! :))) Idk, but for me help her and encourage her to talk, it only sets in harder and harder in my eyes. And DO NOT react overtly if she suddenly starts talking once again, that is my biggest problem with it all.", "What does selective mutism feel like? I once read a book where the main character had Selective Mutism, she would describe it as \"Not having any words\" and that she \"cut all her words out\" She would also say that her chest felt like sand and it felt as if her mouth was filled with rocks. \n\nI am writing a book where one of the characters struggle with Selective Mutism, and I am wondering what it feels like? Physically, mentally, emotionally? Is this an accurate description? It feels like the words are there and you want to say them, but there is suddenly an elephant on your chest and you cannot get any words out.\n\nLike the time in class when the teacher called on you to answer a question even though your hand was not raised, and you know that you have reviewed the answer but your mind just suddenly blanked.\n\nLike when you are a little kid and meeting people for the fist time, and you are too shy and scared to say anything so you hide your face behind your parent's leg.\n\nLike the more somebody tries to get you to respond, the more your body physically fights you and prevents you from speaking.\n\nLike trying to call out for help when you are already freefalling, and you cannot let out any noise because you cannot even breathe properly while the wind is whipping past you.\n\nIt feels lonely not being able to even express your own thoughts and feelings to the people you love the most.  Notwithstanding the caveats that (I) my experience is not generalizable and (II) I have recovered from my selective mutism, which peaked in adolescence, I am hesitant to say that it was like \"not having any words.\" Rather, words\u2014or sometimes a particular *sense*\u2014were regularly present but I could not verbalize them. However, I do concur that this was accompanied by a strange feeling in my chest.\n\nI have sometimes thought of my experience as having two metaphorical properties: **(1)** An inward-looking magnifying glass and **(2)** a metal chain around my tongue.\n\nThe magnifying glass refers to the experience of being overly attentive to my own presence in a space, which caused so much anxiety I could not speak (sometimes for week-long periods at school). And the chain refers to the feeling of verbal entrapment; for, while I was formulating coherent thoughts in my head, uttering them was impossible, as if my tongue was trapped. This is why I do not resonate with the description of \"not having any words\" but, as stated earlier, my experience is only one data point.\n\nI am also glad I stumbled upon this sub. I did not know there was such a large and active online SM community. When it happens and I should respond to any question I have just void in my head.   \nFor example, I go to the doctor and have a prepared question in my head. The moment I walk in, nothing. I do not know even what my name is.   \nI can answer simple questions yes or no. But all thinking is stopped. Feel like in a crusher.   \nThe second scenario is when I want to speak in silence. Like when I do something and want to ask a person in the room, or just tell something. Thinking is working, the question is in my head. But cannot speak. Like a stone in the throat. Completely paralyzed.   \nJust like when you lay on your hand and then it is numb.  Just body will not put out any sound. My personal experience as someone who used to have SM until 14/15ish was that often there was 'words' I knew I wanted to say, but the ability to actually verbalise those words was lost, sometimes like there was a physical barrier in my throat preventing me from saying them, or that 'the words were stuck in my throat'. \n\nFor me even presenting facial expressions or moving my arms to point or convey emotion was difficult, not because I did not know HOW to act, but because it felt like my body was frozen and my limbs and face beyond my control. \n\nDuring the later stages of SM, i still felt the disconnect from my words and body when presented with a 'situation', but as long as I did not push myself it would be at a manageable level of anxious uncomfortableness, only when pushed to talk or to 'just smile' did it feel like, well, the classic anxiety symptoms. A crushing chest or head, a heated body, etc. In these instances the words might 'fall out of my head', by which I mean it often felt like my brain just froze, a strange contrast of both racing thoughts and no thoughts happening at the same time. Like a fight or flight instinct with no way of resolving itself and no real danger. I do not feel it like that at all. I usually have something to say, it is that my mouth has decided to stop doing sounds, to stop moving all together. I can feel it in my throat, as gentle pressure when I cannot speak, and if someone tries to push it, it moves to chest caving in, to tears welling up behind my eyes like I would be holding back crying, but not being able to cry or release it in anyway than getting the pressuring to stop and getting a moment to myself to just be. Mentally I am focused on what I want to say, I am trying to push it to my mouth and out, and I will start berating myself because I cannot. Emotionally, it varies. I can be very scared of the person yelling at me for not speaking, I can hate myself for wasting everyone is time, for not getting myself help because I am not speaking about it, or if I am just by myself, not needing to speak to anyone, I can just let it be. I can be neutral towards it. Drink some water to ease the gentle pressure in my throat, and just accept it.\n\nYou are the 3rd writer on this sub within the last couple days, make sure to check out the other posts to get a better and more encompassing image. It feels like talking is not the right thing right now. Like trying to sleep when you are wide awake. Like someone expecting you to fly. It cannot be done and I should not have to. People make too much noise and do not think enough. Peaked SM between 5-8, IIRC. I had special needs class during that time. No anxiolytic medication. Does feel like not having words. Scared of my voice. I was also afraid of people much more back then, even among relatives. Afraid to speak up in class or asking my teachers for anything. Did not play with the kids back in Kindergarten. At one point, I stopped coloring on my drawing book because all I want to do is nap and look at my desk. Also hallucinated of \u2018tiny worms\u2019 coming out of my hands, so I tried to lick them (but I am not sure if that is the effect of a child brain or stress). I daydream a lot during class and cannot pay attention that well.\n\nResidual effects is still around in a form of social anxiety. Even if I know a topic, I cannot get the confidence to say anything. Probably a fear of judgement by others. Does get better by age. I accepted that I am not neurotypical, but I still underwent the typical childhood and college life. I did choir in 8th grade in Catholic school. 4 years of high school marching band and concert band. Volunteered. Tutored during high school. Started going to house/apartment parties in freshmen year college. Earned my bachelor\u2019s degree in biology.  Just with the occasional \u201cwhy are you so quiet\u201d or \u201cyou seem nervous\u201d, especially on initial impressions. &gt;Like the time in class when the teacher called on you to answer a question... and know that you have reviewed the answer but your mind just suddenly blanked.\n\nThat was a common occurrence for me back in school. I like to think that was unconscious anxiety / emotions kicking in and just wrecked my train of thought. And even I said the right answer, I stumble on words. That sounds more like the experience of being overwhelmed and going non-verbal. When I was a kid, it was more like I was behind very thick glass watching everything around me. I was usually extremely aware of what was happening around me, but unable to interact with the scene. If someone asked me a direct question, I was often unable to answer with more than a nod or head shake, because of the extreme anxiety that would hit when attention was focused on me. I could not speak for the life of me growing up. It is different from shy. I felt incredibly inhibited. I have been selectively mute since my family can remember. Many people have different experiences. For me, I had it as a very young child, so SM was just a normal thing to me. There were times where I did not want to talk, I just had nothing to say in my mind, or if I did want to talk, I could not speak. Like it was an actual physical thing I could not do. I think SM can be a sort of physical thing (I am not sure how else to describe it) Ive never been formally diagnosed, so take this with a grain of salt, but to me it feels like i no longer have vocal cords. I cant even laugh right in an episode. There is a hole in my throat where my voice should be and a rock in it all at once. Emotionally Im sure we can all agree it feels terrible and embarrassing. I am waiting for a meeting to officially get a diagnosis, but I have conformation from my current therapist that I have SM from around the age of 3.  \nAlso I can say that I can relate to some degree with all the comments I have read so far, and yet that everything described is based on my own experience.  \nThe physical \"symptoms\" I usually experience can differ in severity, depending on the situation and if I can manage to lower my anxiety.  \nAny kind of pressure to speak (even when it is with good intentions) or a spike in anxiety will make it worse.  \nThe most common symptoms for me are throat &amp; jaw muscles clenching up, heat waves, and a deep pain in my voice box (also called Larynx/Adam's Apple in men), almost feels like it is being pushed up in my throat.  \nIf my throat hurts, I am past the point I can no longer speak.  \nI have only tried to fight it once, and forced myself to say about 3 words, it was quite painful and my voice came out very scrappy... I decided to not try this again... \\^\\^\n\nWhen it happens I have noticed that in my head I will either blank and enter a \"freezing\" state.  \nOr I get fixated on a certain sentence I want to say but feel like I cannot, and my mind searches for other options but It just keeps going back repeats the same words. (this one usually causes extra anxiety and f\\*s me up for a bit)\n\n\\*English is not my native language sorry for any grammar mistakes. It more like there is a bubble surrounding you. And in order to speak, you will have to prick that bubble, step outside it, and leave it. Very rarely do I do that in public settings.", "Adult with selective/spontaneous mutism, for first time I am trying to help my friend. This weekend he smoked some pot (not the first time) and became entirely non verbal. We have been to the ER twice, CAT scan and blood work, show nothing abnormal.   \nHe is communicated to me that there seems to be a disconnect between the words and thoughts in his head and getting them out.   \nHe is 26, with borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and no diagnosis for being on the spectrum, and has never experienced SM. \n\nHe did inadvertently speak once while vomiting the evening that it happened, but was not aware of it. He was surprised when I pointed it out. Can this be SM? None of the nurses, PAs, or Doctors at the ER had any idea what this could be. It is been 36 hours now, and we are looking for a psychologist that can make an appointment in the coming week.\n\nThank you! Maybe. Could just be autism going non verbal. If it is autism, he is so far un-diagnosed or misdiagnosed. For people with autism who go non verbal, is it usually temporary? I have heard some people say that they \"go non verbal\" so maybe temporary for a lot of people. SM in more about specific situations or conditions. The way he describes it as a \u201cdisconnect\u201d sounds like what happens to me during a migraine honestly. It also happens to people who have seizures or stroke. You can think the words you want to say but it feels like your speaking is disconnected and that part of your brain cannot understand the words you are thinking in order to speak them. It is hard to explain. But with selective mutism it is more like a block that prevents me from speaking but if I could speak I could say the words perfectly. I wish I could explain this better, sorry. But one being a disconnect and the other being a block are the best I can think to describe them. This sounds like a medical condition. \n\nFrom my understanding SM generally develops in childhood, does not develop spontaneously, and is purely situational in most cases. Some things that are typical in SM are anxiety around making any noise in general (from the mouth or otherwise), stiff posture and limited body language, and severe social anxiety.\n\nHis lack of awareness of speaking that evening when he was vomiting is not typical in SM at all. People with SM tend to be hyperaware of any sound they make.\n\nAre there feelings of intense fear surrounding speech, communication, and social interactions for him? If not, it is probably not SM. SM is an anxiety disorder and its symptoms are rooted in anxiety. If this is purely surrounding speech and is not multifaceted in the ways I have described, it is probably not SM.\n\nHope my comment was informative, but do take my comment with a grain of salt. I am not a doctor and this could just be an atypical case of SM. This sounds like a scary situation and I hope your friend can find a way past this.", "how to get better at messaging friends? i have a lot of trouble messaging friends, and i assume a lot of you can relate. since i cant talk much irl i want to at least be able to message, but i cant even do that well. \n\nwhen i get a notification, ill leave it for a few hours and plan out my reply. eventually ill force myself to reply but i still have no idea what or how to say anything, so whatever i end up saying is badly phrased/makes no sense/doesnt add anything to the conversation.\n \nand i can never initiate conversation either. so i wait for my friend to initiate, which obviously leads them to think that i dont want to talk. \n\ndoes anyone have any advice? Yeah, I do not initiate rarely ever....maybe more when I actually really really played actively on Xbox with them I was better with messaging? I honestly do not remember.\n\nBut recently I Snapchat texted a friend after they said happy birthday....I did not want to not acknowledge it, so I just typed it out in my Phone Notes beforehand and copy/pasted it into snapchat, so I would not need to spend 15mins typing it because it was bugging me. It was easier to press paste/send......you do not really need to worry about typing because you are just typing to yourself. \n\n\\*Only time I have ever done that, but it was something that is a good idea thanks!!! im normally the person who it says im typing for 10mins only for me to just say \"lmao\" haha so maybe drafting messages in notes first will help me avoid that Exactly Simple. Let go of the outcome. I do this as well. I have had people comment on how long it takes me to reply so now I just type it out in Notes first. I do not do it all the time, just when I am unsure about what I am saying. I do not want people to know how long it sometimes takes me to write a simple message. i struggle heavily with all of this, and i have found that writing little reminders for myself helps a lot. i personally have a little piece of paper that i keep close to me that says things like this:\n\n* it is just texting. words on a screen\n* (friend's name) WANTS to talk to me and is happy to hear from me\n* i am not a bad friend. things i say are not dumb\n\nit is simple stuff, but these reminders help a TON. they do not make things completely perfect though, but i think i have gotten a lot better at texting because of them.\n\nnow, the whole not knowing what to say/overthinking what you said and thinking it is dumb.... look at it from a different perspective.\n\nif YOU received that text from your friend, would you think it is dumb? and even if it was a bit oddly phrased or whatever, would you really care that much? would that text make you not want to talk to that friend anymore? i find myself replying and i HATE what i said, but then i ask myself those questions and the answer is almost always no. i would be happy just to hear from that person, and chances are they feel the same.\n\nalso take into account other things, like how long have you been friends with this person? they would not stick around if they did not want to talk, did not like you, or if anything you have said was that off-putting :)\n\nas for the initiating, that is probably my weakest point when it comes to texting. i will say this though: if you not initiating is bothering your friends, explain to them that you DO want to talk to them, you just struggle with starting a conversation. maybe even explain the rest of your texting struggles. it is good to be open and honest, and most people will appreciate that. if your friends are good friends, they will try to understand you and they will not judge.\n\ni know this is long haha but hopefully it helps a bit! wishing you the best &lt;3 wow that is really good advice thanks !! Practice is what worked for me. Chatting with random people on any website from Reddit to Whatsapp to Wattpad. It is still more daunting when I know them irl tho.

Seems to me, SM or SAD would make it unbearable and difficult. And my father gets out of it with a hearing impairment in one ear, so...\n\nWell, even it is the case, does not look like I will be able to get excused at any rate. I cannot get a doctor's note. Last time I went to a therapist was middle school, and when I asked the clinic by phone (or at least, I thought it was the place; parents have been less than cooperative) , they said they had no records of me.\n\nPart of me kind of wants to try jury duty since I have just been sitting comfortably at home the past few years (though I will probably end up regretting it). But I also would like to know if I can get out of it in the future. It might, an anxiety or speech disorder could constitute reason not to serve.\n\nThe courts do not want jurors who are legally savvy however, often mentioning that you are aware of the concept of Jury Nullification is enough to have you disqualified for duty. The concept is that the jurors can never be held liable for making a 'wrong' decision. You can literally decide however you want, popular historical usages were in contravention of the Fugitive Slave act. Not saying you should decide in an arbitrary way, but the legal system does not generally want jurors who are aware of this. Something to consider That is very interesting! Just skimmed the wiki page for jury nullification. Kind of wondered if I would get interrogated and then dropped, for being too smart or too opinionated, or something, in which case a preemptive excuse would definitely be best so I do not even have to go through that.

I was so happy and sad at the same time to learn about it, because now my life made sense but I still do not know what to do about it. I have been diagnosed with social phobia w/panic attacks. While I have not been diagnosed with SM, I have been experiencing the symptoms since before kindergarten (that I can remember) and continue to experience them to this day. I definitely have not outgrown it in any way, I have just learned to live my life around it. \nAs a child I could only whisper to my grandma (who raised me) and school was terrible. I was picked on and bullied, and the only reason I was ever able to get a job was because my mom set them up for me. It really means so much to me to know I am not alone. While no one I know may understand me, there are other people out there like me! Other people who know how hard it is to get through life like this. \nI think my biggest challenge is my complete inability to go to a doctor and discuss this. I cannot even pick up a phone to make an appt. Phones have always been my nemesis, it is easier now as so many things can be done online, but even the thought of talking to a doctor makes me shut down. I have been trying to go to the doctor for a couple years for an unrelated issue, and I have not been able to. The best I can do is get in for my prescription refills and lie to my doctor when she is asks how I am. I cannot even control it, I just automatically say I am fine, nothing else to discuss. \n\nI am generally scared to even talk to people online, so I will probably post this and run away. But I am feeling brave at the moment and I want other people to know they are not alone. \n\nI get it guys, life is hard. People do not understand. It seems so silly to not be able to talk, but it is real. It is debilitating. It is not just being shy or reserved, and you cannot just get over it as some people might suggest. I have to push myself so hard everyday just to even function in normal society, but I do it. I have found having a \u2018support person\u2019 to be the easiest way for me to navigate through life. It is extremely difficult to form relationships, so I count myself lucky that I have been able to find people who love me for me. Unfortunately, I often ruin those relationships through my lack of communication, but somehow I have always had at least 1 person in my life at a time who has stuck by me. \nI hope you can all find your own support people, or animals, or whatever helps you get through the day. I hope you all can go to the doctor and find some guidance. I hope you all know how wonderful you are, even if most of the world cannot see it.

I have got good friends, though I have not really kept up with people I knew in school. They were not my people, but I did find my people eventually. It is really tough, but try to keep putting yourself out there. Online friends are good, but in person friendships are golden, especially in terms of overcoming SM. \n\nIf you can, seek help. Also try to think of speaking as practice, not something you have to be perfect at right away. Once you have practiced the basics a little, forming friendships will be easier. \n\nOther tips include listening to other people. What sorts of things do they say? What sorts of questions do they ask others? You are gathering info on how to have a conversation. \n\nThen, if you can, little by little ask questions. Other people love being asked questions. I know that can seem wild to us! But if you can get someone else talking and then really listen to them with true interest, that is a good way to build a friendship. \n\nThe other thing that helped me was getting out and doing things, as well as learning things about others\u2019 experiences. The more you do, the more anecdotes you have in your bank to share. The more you learn, the more potential things you have to share. It does not mean you need to go bungee jumping, but reading an interesting book, or taking a class, or reading Wikipedia, or visiting someplace can help give you something to say. \n\nImprov classes are amazing when you are recovering from SM. They help you see that no one really knows what to say, but they just say something anyway and it is fine. It might sound like the last thing you would want to do, but it a safe space to explore speaking and generate new things to say. And it is a place you might find some new friends too. \n\nOverall, please be kind to yourself!", "What is your personality (16 personality test)? Here is the test:\n Mine is INFP. But I really do not think it is going to be accurate because of our SM. Some of the questions are like \u201cI feel comfortable walking up to strangers and starting a conversation\u201d. With my SM, I obviously would not be able to do that. Without it, I might be able to. SM is not a part of our personality. Infp, sometimes infj That test has been pretty well debunked for a while, like swimming after you eat or drinking 64 glasses of water an hour.  :) \n\nYou might like this, I think it was $5 or at least under $10.  ( INFP, but some of it sounds inaccurate, Yes I agree so much! ENFP (extrovert Yea I am pretty extroverted and without sm and anxiety I would feel comfortable ( I have sm sometimes it is wierd I can feel when I am not going to be able to talk ) Yeap I like these kind of personality tests! But I am not going to use money for them! &gt;:) I do them for fun From what I see so many of you guys are INFP/ENFP... I already know of 3 INFPs irl... and so far I am the only ISFJ i know... LOL INTJ INTP :) infp The Enneagram Personality Test is really great, there was a great free one online around ten years ago but the site's owner had to remove it because of some kind of issue in the coding after an update. A lot of the sites I see anymore charge for it or they offer part of the test for free and a more accurate one for $5 or so.     \n\nSome people will say the the roots of the personality typing system goes back to the Kabbalah and/or a Russian mystic from a few hundred years ago but it is generally accepted that the structure of the actual test is much more recent. An enneagram is a nine-sided star, each of the nine tips of the star represents a different personality type and is given a name and number. What defines each personality type is that they have one great strength, like courage or observation, and since they are so good at this one thing they overuse it in their life. So their greatest strength can also control them in a sense if overused.    \n\nAn interesting thing about the test is if a person can pick up positive traits by integrating parts of the personality type connected to it by a line- since it is a nine-sided star each point has a line moving toward two different points across from it. And in the same way if they pick up negative traits they move toward the other point. So a 7 may be connected to a 3 and a 4, for example, so all type 7 people can look at the positive traits of a 3 to know what traits they should try to pick up and a 4 to know which traits they should try to use (those numbers are not right, just giving examples). I would be interested to know what other people here are so I will make a post about it.", "it is been months and i still have not made eye contact with my therapist i have been seeing this new therapist once a week and i have not talked to her yet. my dad is always in the room during the appointments which is kind of annoying. he acts like my translator but not a very good one. i can sometimes get myself to write something down but a lot of her questions are open ended or just seem dumb. \n\ni kind of wish i could have an appointment without my dad in the room but that is kind of stupid cause i cannot communicate. he is the person i am closest too and i still do not feel completely comfortable around him \n\ni started homeschool in the middle of the year last year. i had no friends or even anyone that talked to me in school so it was kind of pointless. \n\ni have tried making online friends but it never works out. everyone leaves cause i am boring. also i am never the first person to talk. i have some aquantinces on twitter but that is about it. i have tried the discord server but it is just not for me.\n\nthere is no reason for me to even have sm. i have not been through any trauma. i am just self centered even though i hate myself \n\ni am really tired of living. i do not enjoy anything in life. i really wish i could just kms but i am way too scared to do that. i wish that one day all my anxiety just went away so i could end my life. you dont necessarily need to experience trauma to have sm, i never experienced such and i ended up suffering from it. most likely one of your parents has/had anxiety which is a pathway to their kids having anxiety disorders such sm. you should not blame yourself, it was out of your control I feel all of this sooo much. I think that if you were to bring it up to your dad that you want to try going in alone would probably help, because I know exactly how it feels with the whole translator thing. You can never fully express what you want to and sometimes they do not understand what you are trying to communicate. I think that would also be a sign of progress which they can see as a good thing, you do not have to say directly that you just do not want him translating for you. Then you can try the writing stuff down or nodding or something just with the therapist. I just started going to a therapist on my own without my mom there and it was really hard but I was able to get words out eventually (even though I did cry), but that was fine. It is still progress. Also I can relate to the friend thing a lot so if you want you can try talking to me?? I would love more friends and have never talked to someone else with SM so I think that sounds fun. Good luck! One thing: selective mutism is merely an anxiety disorder, which like any other anxiety disorder, it is not induced by trauma. (Note that it *can* be in some cases, but that is rare) You can write a note and give it to the therapist in front of your dad and say I appreciate him being here but i need to speak to you alone. And add like how you feel about those questions if the therapist does not know that she cannot help change it. You know speaking is not the only form of communicating right? I have been to so many counselors; some good and some really bad. With my good counselors, I have been able to communicate through writing. If you are comfortable with it, have your dad outside the room and start communicating with your therapist in writing. You can initiate it by start bringing a pen and notepad with you and write down your thoughts and reply to them. This made me realize there is much more to communication than just your voice. You can even use your phone to type it out! There are so much things you can use especially in modern days :) I hope this helps, from a person with SM to another. Do you have a phone or another device you can put a text to speech app on?", "Am I selective mute? I have suspected that I am probably selective mute for a while, but I have never been sure. I am not diagnosed, but I am pretty sure I have a social anxiety disorder. I usually whisper when I am talking to a friend in public and sometimes I need to step out and take a few deep breaths when I get too nervous while interacting with people. Anyway, here are my experiences.\n\nWhen I am comfortable, other than some occasional stuttering and accidentally mixing words/sentences together, I can talk without any major issues. But starting conversations, or speaking when it is silent/giving late responses is hard. I open my mouth and try to speak, but I cannot. I usually get it out after a few tries if I am not too nervous, but even then, I stutter a lot. Sometimes it is hard to answer at all, even in normal conversations. When I get nervous, I cannot talk at all. I can open my mouth and make a noise, but that is all. No matter how hard I try, I cannot say anything. Sometimes I can get a word out, but I stutter a lot and can never get farther than that. Is this selective mutism? You cannot be 100% sure before being diagnosed, but it sounds like you have it. That is exactly how I feel and I am diagnosed I do not think I can get diagnosed. My dad does not listen to anything I say and is partially the reason that I am like this. Two years ago, I had reached the lowest point in my life. I was really depressed and almost cut myself. My dad found out and scolded me. We had a family discussion and I actually thought he would not try to get me help. The next morning, he gaslighted me(I do not remember what for). I got a depression screening not long after that and scored kind of high. The doctors were not sure if I had depression or not, but it was clear that I was not okay. Sometime after that, I asked him if I could get an emotional support animal and immediately got yelled at. A different time I asked to see a therapist and he dismissed the conversation. I remember bringing up the possibility that I could be selective mute and he was dismissive of that too. Talking to him at all makes me nervous, and talking to him about these things scare me, so I might not even be able to bring it up even if I tried. I am sorry that you have to go through that. I was not able to get diagnosed for a long time because of family, and that made my selective mutism worse. Neglect from them also led to other mental health issues. I was unsure if I had selective mutism or not at the time. If you think you have searched enough about it and still think you might have it, you probably do. Sounds like it Oh no, this really made me sad. I think this is a huge contributor and I am so disappointed in your father. Parents are supposed to support you not tear you down. He should be ashamed of himself. He must not think very highly of himself to feel the need to tear you down  so.", "It can get better.... My 9 yr old has GAD and SAD with SM. (Here is a video she made last year on SM  \n\nOver the last 3 years, we have had her go outside of her comfort zone one time per year, competing in National American Miss. First year was rough. She ran off the stage, crying during her introduction. Last year, she finished, but was pretty quiet and fidgety. \n\nThis past Nov, she started on anxiety meds, 10 mg of Prozac/day. She decided to enter a writing contest this past Arbor Day and placed 3rd place city wide. She had to read her essay in front of approximately 7 news crews and all the people in attendance. She was really nervous/anxious but she wanted to go read it. July, we go do NAM again. SHE KILLED HER INTRO. \n\nShe just told me this morning that she is running for student council and has to write a speech and read it to her class. She didnt even seem that bothered with having to be the \"center of attention\".  \n\nThis mom (and dad) are so extremely proud of how far she has come. She still has bad days, where her anxiety is high, but those days are getting further and further apart. I know she will always have anxiety. I know she will always second guess everything (as do I). But there is light at the end of this complex tunnel!", "Everything I want, I want nothing to do with in the same way. I have said I wish I could tell everything to everyone......but I do not want to tell anything to anyone. I answer to my mom how I want to talk, but I do not want to talk. I nod 'no' to everything she may ask, even if it conflicts against the 'no' I just nod......because it is no for everything. It is confliction, and she said my answers make no sense, but my answers reflect well\n\n *\"My life is two different people* *~~trapped to be stuck in chains together~~**.\" I wrote this in my log for the 22nd, second part eh, do not really like, so I cross it out here.......*\n\n*......*I do not like how my Mom got tickets for me to go to a concert(s) with my Dad.....I am molded to like something, and I do not know what I like. I like certain things but I have never had the self-ability to confirm what I am. \n\nI sunk inside when I heard she got those tickets because it is a nice gesture, but it sucks. It is for bands that my mom thinks I like along with my dad (in the same way), when my music taste is the thing they know least about me. I can appreciate a lot of music, and not hate it, to hate it (in this case 80s bands)............but there are few artists I can connect with on any real level.........where I am that deep in, akin to my dad. That is why it sinks, because I am thought to like this music on that level when it is so far from reality. \n\nToday I was listening to older Justin Bieber....That should be me, one less lonely girl, stuck in the moment, life is worth living...and I like it, I like the love songs bro\n\n*There was only one time I pictured and was excited (so hopeful) for the future, and not now.

Otherwise I just make it up the next day, within my house becausse anything I intiate....is on my computer.*\n\nBasically where I have any freedom is the computer, though I play wizard101 and avoid questing with people (since MMO, quests, etc....) I say it is to not slow me down, but idk I do not really want to mess with other people, not when I am questing at least.......where on the other hand, there is this \"The Commons\" where everyone can play and socialize, and there I can be a menace to society, but if someone knows me for too long, I am either that menace still or when I do get real I become closed off.....where I can start as, being really 'crazy'.................so I am free with myself, but not really. Not actually. And......I could play xbox with my friends again (xbox live), but i do not want to go in that room, and I do not want to.\n\nIn wiz101, I can be in \"The Commons\" and say I will help someone being all chatty (no VC in this game, and I avoid ever giving my discord, no mic...and do not like it; everyone always wants to join a call).............And then I go to help this one person with a quest....and I stop chatting like I did, just making simple responses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I am writing my entry for the 22nd still now...it is real today....usuallly I just cannot think of anything to write besides just keeping a log of what events happened.

If both her and my Dad die, my siblings will not deal with the Bullshit......if I had the motivation to tell her that that is why she does not understand anything about SM, I would. But I do not. Even if I did she would just deny not knowing what SM is. She is no help.\n\nIt only makes me angry because she has no clue what I have. Otherwise I really do not care what she has to say, it adds nothing to my life.\n\nShe compares me to 'normal' people, there is no comparison to be made.\n\nIf I had any motivation to work on it all, I would. I just do not. The same anxieties would be there still...I would just have the motive to not care.\n\nAnd she calls me depressed. For a time there I would have agreed, maybe textbook definitions, I am. Either way, I am not super happy or sad (just saw a tiktok). I just stick to myself and avoid everyone else.\n\nAnd I do not like when she talks to me, she is just dramatic and exaggerated about everything, going to the worst....she brought out my old toddler blanket, and told me to have it because I 'act like a baby,' and it pisses me off because something like that is destructive. If she wants me to be motivated, she should try to motivate me, not break me down; I already know every struggle I face, I live it. She thinks I avoid my problems, and maybe I avoid talking about them, but I do not avoid the internal reality of them. I know the reality, I live the reality, I am the reality. I have no care to strive towards a 'normal life' and I put those '' because I do not find 'normal life,' normal. I find this normal.......I am just honest about how I feel these days with everybody or I just do not say anything. I say whatever I am motivated to, if I am not motivated to say words, I say nothing. I do not even think my SM is truly that bad, if I had the motivation, I would want to work on it, or I could work on it.\n\nI just want to be left alone really\n\nI am only angry because no one understands I am sorry to hear that. It definitely sounds like she is hurting your efforts. Do not know how old you are but eventually the motivation will come. Eventually, there is no other option usually. Also the people I surround myself with as adult are a lot more interesting people than those I was stuck with as a kid. There is not much to say when you have nothing in common with most people in your daily life. I rlly get you, I tried telling my dad that I might have SM and he just shuts me down and makes it into a lecture, \"what do you mean, u're completely normal\", \"theres nothing wrong with you\", \"do not listen to how people box you in\" like, in middle school I legit lied to the only chance I could have had of getting a diagnosis, because I was an insecure shit and my parents kept complaining that I am causing them problems, like what am I supposed to do now? I find alot of parents have internalized ablism. They refuse to believe their child could have a \"mental illness\" and instead of working on helping the the issues, they deny those issues could even exist to begin with. At least, not in THIER child. Parents also tend to be super narcissistic. If they have a child with a problem, they think society will blame them for that problem, so again, they cover it up and pretend it does not exist. Too many parents are only ever focused on appearances, and it is disgusting that they treat their children like accessories. Sounds like your dad is very ablist and cannot handle the fact that his DNA helped contribute to making you, someone who struggles with SM. Does he also berate and talk down about people in wheelchairs? Or blind/deaf folks? Either way, he needs to get over himself. Exactly, but nah. He just does not believe that I could have possibly gotten a mental ilness from his DNA, he is so in denial it hurts. He never talks down about people with physical disabilities tho. Just last year he was talking about how depression does not exist, but this year he switched his mindset, because he and my stepmom thought my brother haa depression. Ig if a female says she has something, she is just emotional and an attention seeker but when it is about a male person, it must be true.", "are you able to talk to animals?  Nobody can talk to animals, with the exception of 'smarter' ones like birds/elephants i meant literally speaking to animals, regardless of whether you are understood or not. i am curious as to whether the anxiety also applies to interacting with animals too In my experience I can talk fine to my pets but to people sometimes I go mute especially if im stressed I ride horses, and when I am riding or when I am around my horse, I can whisper to her, compared to usually being completely nonverbal. Horse riding is pretty relaxing, which helps beat anxiety. I think that is why it helps. Yeah, was mute until I was 11 but could talk to my dog (that we had had since I was four) just fine. Yes. \nIt is definitely easier. Animals do not ask questions. They take you as you are. And knowing that the pet will not respond (verbally) makes it easier to talk because you do not keep making (im)possible scenarios of how they could answer.\nMy biggest wish since I have been little always has been a dog. Sadly I never got one. Now I am wondering how my life would have changed if I had had a dog. Yes as long as there were no other people around. Yes. I will smile and greet animals I pass on the street while totally blanking their owners. yes, but not loudly, and often not in a way that makes sense because they do not understand anyway lol. yes, very quietly or just mouth moving. it is much easier to talk to animals.", "Why I was Mute for Three Years  Awesome, thank you!", "\"Real Monsters\" by Toby Allen - Mental disorders imagined as beasts ", "I have only regressed in the month of August, I do not really see the point in recovery...although I feel like if I had the motivation I could recover before my goal, which is by the time I turn 19 (in under 3 months). I just have no more motivation. I feel like if I did, talking would not be too far away from the current date (I just believe that). Though I just do not give a shit anymore, even if I started to talk now...I just do not see what it gets me. It is like even if I recover, it feels like there is almost an immediate need for recovery again in the same sense. Overcoming SM would be the foundation for New things, but it would not immediately bring me all these New things.\n\nInitially I had met a girl and there was just that hope in the back of my mind that maybe I could have that or have her...but now it is almost 2 months since I did and I just feel that is something out of the question now. It is basically what I put all my motivation into, before that meeting I had no real care to overcome SM. After, I did, and I had never cared more in my life (The path of change, starting at the beginning of July), by the end of July I was the most motivated to overcome SM I had ever been. Though a week into August and I have nothing. There is no cares.\n\nAnd for the last few days for the few times I have gone out in public this month, I do not care as much what others are thinking of me because idk? Does it really matter? I guess I feel like I am in a limbo.\n\nAnd I was kind of glad thinking college would start on August 30th for my 2nd semester and it is at a New school, but ever since July there is been no motive....I expected to keep building that motive and by the time I was in college classes I would want to speak, but now I tend to think I am not going to...and there is no reason not to, it is just there is also no drive to. I just do not care to give any input to anything, I just do not feel like it really matters. If it does not lead to some sort of end result, I just do not see value in it.\n\nWriting this is more of a vision, I have kept my self so distracted the last month from the lack of any progress that I have not had anytime to reflect on too much. I almost cried today, but I do not give my self enough time to cry. I know deep down I do not think I am mentally there in a good mindset...I feel like there is just no point to the end, anymore.\n\nAt this point in time, I pretty much do not have friends although \"I do,\" the only contact is through the sub-weekly snapchat I will send to them. Otherwise there is no contact and I am not one to be known to 'want to hang out.' And at the same time I do, I do not.....there is actually this local car show that happens every friday night, but I cannot go alone. I only have ever gone with my Dad, if I did go alone I would be a duck in a puddle (or whatever). I want to be my own person, but at the same instance I just want to stave off my problems as long as I possibly can until I inevitably die.\n\nI kind of feel like I prefer death at this point, though I know death is no good gurantee. I know I can make my life what I want it to be, but I have to be the one to do that. I feel a lot like the Kid LAROI song \"I Wish,\" where he says \" You say you cannot help me, I have got to help myself. But I need help with that, because I feel so helpless.\"\n\nI have been very isolated this month, where I was not last month. My Parents and whole family basically got sick and that is where it all went away...I would only say I have regressed this month. I was picking up food for a while for my family in August, but the latest time and I had to have my sister come with me to go inside and get the food, I just had no interest to do it. And I did not want to. Although I did it before about 5 times on my own. Although I am nervous as shit each time.\n\nI do want to recover relatively soon, my goal was 19 but idk if the motivation will ever come back in time enough to shoot for that. School is soon and life is going to return to how it was before I wanted change, I feel like I am going to be stuck in my own blackhole once again and change will not come. It all just sucks.\n\nAnd my Mom is actually in the hospital because she came down with Pneumonia and they are keeping track in case of Blood Clots, but I do not feel sad about it or worried or anything. When it comes to any problems like this in my life, unless it has to do with me. I just can not feel for it, anything I feel emotion for comes from myself being able to directly relate to it, otherwise I do not feel emotion for anyone else. I feel like I am not empathetic, and the emotion I do give off is more so to stave away the questions about the lack of it. I think it has to do with my unhappiness. It is very hard to get me to genuinely laugh person to person. And it is with talking too there is just nothing I would actually care to discuss, as to me most things are meaningless.\n\nWith that dream of a life with that girl I met, I felt like I saw some sort of path there, but now there is no path.\n\nThat is it.

Came across this sub recently and researching SM has met with a lot of my experiences. Except I do not totally struggle with school, sometimes I can speak while there and sometimes I cannot at all. I cannot speak around my mother or therapist at all, and struggle to communicate in anyways despite wanting too. Do I need to specifically struggle with common examples of SM or can it be any place? At the end of the day. The name if the diagnosis doesnt matter. But if you really want to get diagnosed. Even though most of us suffer with SM. We are not doctors (as far as I am aware).\n\nTo me your case sounds like a moderate version. Because you need to remember that there is levels of serverity with all illness'.\n\nI suggest you go to see a professional for a diagnosis or atleast dome coping strategies tailored to you and specifically you.\n\nAt the end if the day SM is an anxiety disorder and perhaps try some anxiety based strategies to calm yourself down. Because it wont do any harm. The diagnostic criteria for SM is: \u201cconsistent failure to speak in specific social situations despite speaking in other situations.\u201d SM does usually present as being unable to speak in school or in other public settings but able to speak at home, but there are some people who are the opposite, although it is slightly more rare. It does not matter what setting you find yourself unable to speak in. Its still considered SM. Thank you Can you give some examples of anxiety based strategies? There are many that can be found online. I do not deal with my anxiety well so I do not want to try and give my strategies. That is ok, thank you anyways! For me, I cannot speak only around my classmates. I am incapable of speaking around healthcare professionals, especially about my mental health. What comes out is just a whisper.

A lot of the public is not aware that she can talk, but the industry just thinks that she is rude because they know she can. And due to her awkward Mannerisms antisocial behaviors and deathly fear of eye contact she is gained the reputation of mean rude in distant. \n\n But she is actually really nice when you get to know her. And she wants to break the cycle and fixed the reputation but she does not really know where to start. But stries to begin by becoming friends with othother member of the main cast.\n\n\n\nHi um so is this harmful representation? Any tips? Wahtas the best way to get someone with sm to begin talking \n\nBtw it is fine if you rip her to shreds she is in early planning stages lol. We are the complete rejects of society whose reputation teeters on a completely mentally disfiguring disease that also is not visible to the naked eye. Write whatever you want because none of us can verbally stop you. I think this is the autism kicking in but I cannot tell if your mad at me or what No I am not mad. I am just saying to do what you want. Any representation for selective mutism is representation. Even so, do what you want and do not let others dictate what is offensive and what is not. If it feels right to you, then publish what you will. I just want to make sure I am representing the condition accurately. And realistically I feel like being a semifamous model, the character would  at least give a sign to the public that she has some sort of mental condition. To keep the plot the same, lets say this sign doesnt work very well, like maybe she would wear a sm wristband during her performances or something but not many people notice, idk. This sounds interesting. There is almost no positive representation for selective mutism, and when it comes to real life examples, I cannot think of a single mostly-nonverbal celebrity or famous person. So far this does not sound harmful, but it could probably use some work, or at the very least, it is a good base skeleton that could use some further development.   \n\n\nIf she is been diagnosed and she is a public figure, she would probably be an advocate for selective mutism or some kind of disability activist, since that tends to be the case with a lot of disabled famous people in real life, even if only on a very small scale (Viktoria Modesta immediately comes to mind--she is a model and an amputee--but besides performing at the Paralympics once, she is not really an activist beyond just being a visibly disabled famous person). Selective mutism is one of those conditions you cannot really \"see\" if you are an outsider, and being unable to speak verbally for yourself makes it *extremely difficult* to defend yourself if people think you are just rude.   \n\n\nMaybe there could be some moment in the story where she does a press conference or press release or just a long-winded social media post where she opens up about having selective mutism and how it affects her; then maybe public perception about her shifts with some people being on her side and thinking \"wow I really thought she was just a rude bitch but actually she just cannot speak in public\" while other people still do not quite understand and think she should just get over it by trying yoga and mindfulness excercises and they still think she is just making excuses for being rude and unfriendly.  \n\n\nIn terms of getting her to start talking, it would be good to have her eased into it; for example, she has one or several people she *can* speak around to help give her a sort of buffer around people she cannot speak around. Some of us can also force ourselves to speak when we normally would not be able to, but that can be extremely distressing and energy-draining, so it is definitely not ideal. Basically it should be a slower process based on how comfortable she is around the people she is with and how much she trusts them, something like that. It should not be an instantaneous \"wow suddenly for dramatic tension I am 100% comfortable speaking in this situation\", but rather more like building herself up to monosyllabic/one-word responses and then eventually up to full conversations with no problem.  \n\n\nSorry if this is rambling or unhelpful. I am also writing a character with selective mutism but I have the benefit of writing from experience. &gt;\nIn terms of getting her to start talking, it would be good to have her eased into it; for example, she has one or several people she can speak around to help give her a sort of buffer around people she cannot speak around.\n\nPleas elaborate on this point please I love this response! I am glad it helps! What I mean is, say she has, for example, one person in particular that she is very close with and very comfortable speaking around, like a best friend or a sibling. If she had to enter a new situation where she knew she would not be able to speak but would eventually have to, she could ask this person to come with her for support. The person could help her feel comfortable and at ease enough to maybe at least say a few small things like a greeting and introduction at first and then help her feel comfortable enough to start speaking a bit more; otherwise, if it is still too stressful for her to speak, the person could help explain her situation to others and even speak *for* her like an interpreter (with permission, of course).   \n\n\nFor example, I personally usually rely on my brother to speak for me in public by either showing him what I want to say in a note on my phone or by just saying it quietly to him off to the side and he then repeats it louder for everyone else.", "Some memes I made  Relatable indeed Same- I can relate to all but the first meme happens to me.

I talk to myself and laugh at my own jokes. And at night when I feel lonely I pretend that people(usually celebrities) are hanging out with me. I feel like I have close relationships with celebrities, especially some that have passed recently which is messing me up and making me sad that they are gone. It is like having imaginary friends again. How sad is that? Is it normal with selective mutism? I do the same thing I had SM when I was a child (I am 20 now). When I am alone in a room, I often mumble well structured discourses, imagining myself talking to someone in a given interaction that I am actually not a part of. In my case, the imagination involves people that I actually know, and places where I have actually been.\n\nSometimes I realize that what I am doing does not make any sense, right in the middle of doing it, and I feel like an idiot.

Thank you!", "Hey... Advice? So I have always been a quiet kid most of the time, but talked a lot to people I am close to. I guess I got quieter and quieter and now I only talk (at a normal volume max) to close people when we are alone. This happened over summer break (yes I know it happened fast but I have some stuff going on at home) and the worst part is that I am moving on to highschool now. As most people in this subreddit can probably understand, it is not something you can just get over. I just feel like I cannot speak to most people and under most circumstances anymore and that sucks. What sucks even more is that over the summer when I am with my friends I am at my house so I can talk to them normally, so me not talking when I go to school will probably be a shock to them. I am planning on doing something to help this, but until I talk again, what do I do? Not even my family knows I cannot speak around most people now.\n\nSo once again, I ask of you: what should I do in this time when I am not speaking? How do I go to highschool, not knowing anything about it, (and being in a literary arts program where we speak quite frequently) and being unable to speak for a while? I will accept any advice, I just do not know what to do.  Well, you should at least tell your friends, if not your family, as they will know you and the school better so they may know how to handle the situation at least slightly better. If you really dont want to bring it up with anyone, maybe write the teachers or school that you have a sore or strep throat, and it hurts a lot to talk? Best of luck, i hope things work out for you :) Thanks so much! I will probably do most of what is above since I had absolutely no direction of what to do and that sounds like the best course of action to take lol Well im glad i could help!", "Are people with selective mutism HSP or highly sensitive people ? I had selective mutism as a kid. I remember I was really ticklish, disturbed by the feelings or non low rise socks, and disliked the feeling of paper after touching water. But it was never severe where I would consider myself having a sensory processing disorder and nothin I could not deal with- I just did not like it. I was inhibited as a kid and super afraid to sit on my dads shoulders and stuff.\n\nBut I do not know if I would be considered a highly sensitive person since I do not think I have a sensory processing disorder. I am diagnosed with adhd though. But yeah I was curious bc i thought kids w selective mutism were highly sensitive but I do not think I am HSP has not really got a concrete meaning yet. Generally it is sensory processing related and is considered to affect both environmental and social stimuli, and environmental 'sensory processing'  is not really a factor in SM. Some people with ADHD can feel as if they have sensory issues due to the attentional issues present in ADHD. Sesnory processing disorder and HSP traits can be found in all sorts of disorders, from anxiety, depression, autism etc. as well as some evidence HSP traits are associated with certain personality traits. A HSP is basically just someone with a high score of the personality trait of 'sensory-processing-stimuli' rather than a discrete special type of person. So, imo, someone with SM could be a 'HSP', or they might not be ie. not everyone with SM is a 'HSP', but they might be.", "Went to a therapist but could not talk Last year we could finally afford professional help. I have been living with selective mutism ever since I was a little kid, and I want it to end already. I have progressed a lot, I can talk to strangers and I became more talkative on the whole. But I still cannot seem to get a word out in serious situations, or when I am directly asked something. \n\nI sat in the session for nearly 2 hours and I could barely say anything, I was just crying out of frustration, it was terrible. My therapist kept.asking things and I could only answer them in my head, and I tried so hard. Only a few words. At the end of the session she said we shouldnt pay her if I cant talk, because she can' help this way. I just feel so helpless, because I really tried to talk, but I could not. It is pretty natural to not open to your therapist in the first time. \"You do not have to talk\" is I guess the whole point. Therapy I think is supposed to be some kind of relaxation. Maybe not with that therapist, but with another; you could try alternative methods of communication ? I am going through the same thing, I wrote about my similar experience to r/socialanxiety and it is the first post you will see on my profile I have been trying to be more open lately with my family and my thoughts even though I have not overcome SM. I do not necessarily like it, and I will not just go blurting out too many things, but I have gotten a little out of my comfort zone in that way. I get really angry with therapists like this, honestly. I have (almost completely) recovered from mine, and a therapist of all things should know that it is an anxiety reaction. If you add pressure, add expectations, etc, you will not get the desired result. \n\nEvery single situation with anxiety needs an open and \\*safe\\* environment (including the people) to work through the issues in. Sitting with the person who is struggling, reassuring them that they do not \\*need\\* to feel forced to talk right away, whenever they are ready. Asking yes and no questions to make sure they are comfortable. Reassure them a lot. Ask if they would like for you to write down some questions you would like answered when they are able to, even if it is by letter at first, etc. It is not hard. When i was a kid i basically went to therapy with the purpose of getting me more comfortable with communicating, it was very targeted and purposeful. Got me up to whispering to teachers within a few years. Maybe that would be a good jumping off point for you, having your family find a therapist that handles those sorts of things First of all, congratulations on making the first step to get to the therapist! It is not easy!  Keep going!  Maybe you could print out a paper that says to check out selective mutism and give it to your therapist? Remember baby steps!  My girlfriend had the same problem it takes her a bit to warm up to people she has selective mutism and she used to have this problem when she started going to therapy I had to remind her that I knew her for 2 years and had never heard her talk once I finally heard her talk for the first time in three years of knowing her but only in one word it takes time to get used to someone new like a long time with her she is got to be extremely comfortable with you to talk and even still after 4 years of knowing her when she is in a uncomfortable situations she will get quiet and she can answer me she sometimes gets frustrated to the point where she starts hitting her head I say all that to say to this find someone who is at the very least knowledgeable on selective mutism and understand it will take awhile like a few times my girlfriends therapist played games and just hung out with her the first few times to get her comfortable and later on started talking while playing games just get comfortable with them it will take time and it definitely will take a few therapist to find one you can get comfortable with this is only from my experience with my girlfriend though so take this with a grain of salt There may be other ways to communicate. Have you thought about writing out your thoughts to get the ball rolling? Personally, I can write mine out before or after the fact, but not always during a mute episode (depends how bad I am doing at the time). Some things that have helped me were writing out all the things I wanted to say afterwards and giving it to them for next time, then they can walk through what you wrote with you. Also, once I finally started being able to speak some in front of them when the mutism would get in the way, I found it helpful if they turned around and did not look at me while I spoke, took some of the pressure off. Also, a trigger for me is having something I have written read aloud, so that was always a no go. We could discuss it only if they did not read it off the paper outloud. This therapist sucks. Find another one. You did not do anything wrong; you were just frightened. Maybe try looking for therapists who specialize in sm? This one does not sound like an understanding person The same thing always happens to me \n\nThen I ended up emailing the psychologist tons of diary entries, and she would bring it up and I would occasionally answer. Otherwise what the therapist said was pretty ignorant, she does not understand the condition.   \n\nYou should seek out a selective mutism specialist!", "J.Lo Meets A Little Girl With Selective Mutism On \u2018World Of Dance\u2019  Love that, positive exposure for those who have SM.", "How to date with SM? I have had my girlfriend for about 3 years now but I feel like more and more talking is becoming too straining for me every day. \nI didnt know I had SM till this year and it feels like it is getting worse and worse and I am getting less and less sleep. Now to explain I am sleeping about 4-14 hours a day but no matter what I do I only get about 15\u201030 minutes of REM sleep and you need at least 2 hours.\nI dont know what it is that has caused this but if I get anxious or stressed I cant properly communicate. Since I have spent my whole life with my mom pushing down mental diseases I have forced myself to talk anyway but I cant ever seem to make it come out forcefully without it offending whoever I am talking to.\n\n I usually say stuff like:\n\"I do not know\"\n\"I dont care\" \n\"Can you stop\"\n\"No.\"\nBut I will only say it once (if I even can)\n\nAnd then I start:\n-clenching my jaw\n-holding something really tight\n-crying silently\n-screaming inside my head\n-not wanting to be touched ,or wanting to be touched and refusing to say anything about it or touch anything.\n\nAll of the above reactions make my girlfriend angry and she has not shown any signs of trying to help.\nShe says I dont tell her how to help, but I have... and once i say it once, well that is it. I tried so hard to get it from brain to mouth the first time it is very unlikely to so it again.\n\nSo now my questions:\n1. How would you recommend I tell her I need more help with my SM then I can handle\n\n2. Do you think its unreasonable for me to only say it once and be upset that I cant speak when she does not seem to care about what I said needs to change\n\n3. How do you think she could help not communicate  but not feel like I am just ignoring her (because I never do I am just too stressed to talk for a long while, like days sometimes)\n\n4.

Though I was undiagnosed and unattended , its very unlikely that it was not anything else.\nThere were some specific people who I can talk to very normally, but there were topic restrictions.\nThere were some others who I can talk a few words which were in very low voice. Sometimes I had to repeat myself because it gets inaudible.\nAnd then there are the rest who I do not open my mouth to. I could not even let them hear me talk to other people.\n\nAnd years later , I was diagnosed with AvPD around the age of 24. \nI can talk to almost all the people but still in a lower voice. I still have restrictions on what kind of stuff I can talk about, especially towards parents or similar elder relatives.\nAnd still, there are a very few people who I am a mute to. \nAre there avoidants here who had SM as a child ?\n I am pretty sure I have both Avpd and selective mutism. I was very quite since childhood and never spoke to my classmates. I cannot speak to any family members except my immediate family. It is very hard to speak at my workplace even for important things. Life is getting harder everyday. People just feel that I am not interested in talking to them or hanging out. Even when I have to buy things I speak in a low voice and just want to get done quickly and leave. I did, but had no idea why I could not talk to anyone at school. I could talk to my family and the immediate neighbours but that was all. It was assumed that i was just shy. I also had a very quiet voice and when no one answered me, i assumed that they had heard me and chose to ignore me. Mt vice was loud in my head and no more than a whisper when I spoke. I made an effort when i went to High School to remake myself and develop a personality and managed to talk to some people and even had a couple of friends. as an adult I have made men way through life, but at the age of 58 choose to have a peaceful isolated life.  What is AvPD? Avoidant personality disorder I came to this sub because selective mutism seems to be gaining notoriety lately and I am not sure why. I grew up selectively mute and have pretty much the same experience that you described. I was undiagnosed and people just called me quiet and shy. I did very well in my school studies so no one ever bothered to make much effort to see why I did not speak. I am 32 now and I have improved a lot over my adult years and do not have many SM moments anymore but I am still quiet and soft-spoken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have described myself in the past as having AvPD when I learned of it and have become more avoidant lately.

It was so painful to talk around people I was not comfortable with which was pretty much everyone except my immediate family and a few very close friends.  \n\nMy mind would \u201cshut off\u201d and I could not get words out no matter how hard I tried. I also had separation anxiety which started at age 3 when I started pre-school and I also had/have mild speech problems (which I read are both associated with SM). My family thought I was just shy and for awhile I thought I was too, although I knew there was something deeper going on. It did not make sense to me that I could talk and be normal around my family but when around everyone else I could not speak. \n\nI found out about SM a few days ago and I started crying. I had no idea there are others like me. I spent the majority of my childhood wondering why I could not speak and make friends when I wanted to so bad, and I thought I was the only one suffering this way. \n\nAlthough I am doing much better than I was when I was younger, I still have significant issues with talking. I want to find a therapist who specializes in SM who can help me overcome this. But I am scared of what my family will think if I tell them, excluding my mom. I believe my mom also had SM as a kid (if she did not she was very shy) and she understands me a lot more than anyone. I told her and she was supportive and said it made sense. But I am scared to tell my other family members specifically my dad, sister, and brother. Part of my fear is that they will not believe me because they did not understand exactly what I went through. I do not know if they knew I could not talk. I think they all thought (except my mom) that I just refused to. \n\nHow would I bring this up to them? Is it worth it? How did your family find out? My family found out about my SM via my mom. Like you, she was the first one who knew about it. I think it is fairly important that your family knows you have it so that they understand why you are not speaking to them, and do not attempt to pressure you to speak and just make it worse. Another way you could let them know is by sending them (or showing them in person, whichever works for you) an article about SM. I will link a few good ones below. \n\n\n - this is a good overview of SM, despite the fact that it refers to it as a \u201cchildhood anxiety disorder\u201d. A lot of articles refer to SM like this, despite the fact that there are many adults who have SM, not just children. Unfortunately it is still a very common misconception. \n\n - and here is a little brochure/document I made about SM.

Omg I thought I was alone with this thought. Every time I search about selective mutism, and watch these long youtube documentaries about it, all featuring literal kids in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.. I, (a 23 yr old) cannot help but  feel a little ashamed in myself / sad. I recently talked to my therapist about my past and she praised me for my progress. I did not think mutism is common in adults as well, because in my case, society eventually forced me to talk and I did not want to be the weirdo anymore. I thought it is the way everyone has to go if they do not want to be homeless or whatever. I know, it does not happen in a moment, but technically I had 18 years to adjust and learn often used phrases. So may I ask to what degree and when it occurs? I am not fully healed, but they call the known remainings anxiety. Maybe because it is more researched than mutism. Yep yep yep \ud83e\udd72 one of the biggest things i personally struggle with is asking for help. i have a broken computer in my closet my dad could easily fix if i asked him for help, i want my sister to do something for me but i need to prepare to ask. other things are, i have always been horrible at talking to peers. in school environments, it was so bad that i opted to simply stop going (i guess it massively manifested in agoraphobia). when asked / told to do things by people, i just do it without saying \u201cok\u201d or give any prompt suggesting i will do it. in general, i do not speak unless it is something my brain finds necessary. i can speak to therapists and at job interviews. i can speak but a lot of the time i cannot / do not Wow, asking for help is indeed a struggle for me too. I sometimes manage it by starting a casual conversation and slowly hinting in the direction I want to ask.\n\nOr sharing information I care about. I dislike acquaintances knowing my true passions, because... I fear them crushing it? Idk, I noticed I lie pretty often, just so I do not have to go into detail. I feel I have to explain myself all the time. \"Why are you doing it LIKE THAT?\". I value individuality in others, but I just want to seem as generic as possible, so I do not get negative or overly positive attention. \n\nLol, the \"ok\" part was me too, but I figured out it is weird and now it is barely a problem. Exactly how I feel. Tried to find resource manuals and all of them describe how to deal with children with it... Yeah, my exact thoughts! I am taking a body and language course at school, and decided to try researching about selective mutism and its healing process-as the professor called it. Almost all of the sources that came up were related to teachers' and parents' perspective of children with SM, group vs individual therapy for children, reintegrating children into a classroom setting, etc. One article that was about an adult with SM ended up with what felt like a condescending attitude toward SM though, so I am kind of at a loss for words. \n\nFor something that does not seem rare, it certainly feels like there is an immense lack of information, or at least follow-up research. However, I have considered one obstacle-it can be easy for others to misinterpret or misdiagnose SM as shyness, mutism, rudeness, manipulation, etc. The wide variety of signs and scenarios make SM seem like a more open-ended matter, kind of like autism spectrum condition. SAME!! We suffer so much trauma as kids with SM, even if we had great parents who tried their best and got us the help that was available. I was diagnosed in 1989, when I was 7, and while there was therapy available for it back then, it was NOTHING compared to what is available for kids today. I love that kids today are faring so much better and I am happy for them, but there is still this big part of me that still mourns my childhood and all the things I never got to do but wanted to. I come across now as a mostly fully functional adult lol, but SM has kept me from doing so much stuff that I have ACHED to do but was simply unable to. I have healed a lot, but still there is still SO MUCH MOURNING. I felt the same way too. I tried so many media social platform e.g Facebook,Twitter,Quora, forum and even here in Reddit there is barely to no article about adult selective mutism.", "A selective mutism documentary.

Be happy and stop thinking about what others think.", "New to this subredit and sharing my story It is not that selective mutism really ruiend my life, it is the people and, their ignorance to understand. Growing up, I would get yelled at in the middle of classes in front of the other 50 students in the room for not speaking. This went on untill I graduated high school. I always got nagged by teachers and, students to speak. I have been told by one teacher that, I was basically making a mockery of people who cannot actually talk. In which that comment still ticks me off to this day. I have never really had a true friend. People thought that I was weird and, would not engage in conversation. They just stared and, talked smacked whenever I walked by. The only time other kids would talk to me is when they wanted to know why I did not talk. I got annoyed. Not only because, it was a repetitive question but, also because I did not have an answer to it. Sometimes the teachers would get their nose in the conversation and, spew out misinformation. Such as, \"She just chooses not to\" or, \"She is just stubborn\" I have been through dozens of therapy sessions, camps and, such but, nothing worked. Honestly, I do not understand as to why my disorder needed so much therapy. Its as if they just expected me to just start talking and, I would instantly be cured. Yeah, that is not how that works. Throughout, my life, I was emotionally abused by my mother who has, NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder). In which just made my selective mutism worse. I am almost 24 and, I have no friends. I thought I had friends but, it turned out that they only included me just out of shear pitty. Since graduation, they have not bothered me since. I am hoping that after I move out of my mom's house, I can finally start the healing process. Only thing that makes SM worse is reinforcement. If your therapies included forcing you to speak then that would surly have yielded no result. I am also individual suffering from SM since childhood and now even after graduation. The best cure I think is to give yourself a cold start, i. E. Move into a city or country or location where no one even knows you. From there you can work on yourself to get rid of this condition. If you are bilingual then it is best to move into the location where you can extensively use 2nd language since use of each language makes your personality different it will be very effective for you. The only thing makes SM untreatable is the people around us who knows we cant speak or we struggle to even if those people are supportive because SM is extreme form of shyness (its mutated form of shyness tbh) where we are shy enough to break expectations of others against the image we have in their minds.\n\nHope that helps and hope you heal well soon. hey I agree that a change of scenery, such as living abroad, can definitely help with SM ! \n\nThe SM was severe with my native tongue, where as, I was more carefree and could socialise much more easily when i was living abroad and speaking in my my bilingual language (english) or the local language (even if my level was meh and could only improve from there). Even going to a foreign country where it is still easy to get by in English helps. It was almost like having two personalities... There is also generally more patience i guess from people who know you are from abroad and integrating a new culture, which can give that positive feedback loop. I am a parent of a kid with SM. Thank you for sharing and I wish you healing and happiness in your future!", "Dancing and singing? For those of you who have been able to start speaking, how do you feel about dancing and singing? Weather its privately with my GF or in a big group. I get very similar feelings to how I felt dealing with selective mutism. Does anyone feel the same way? Any tips? Not SM but I understand the aversion to it. Ive never understood casual dancing. Never know where to put my limbs. Singing, *maybe* with a lot of practice alone I would get comfortable enough to sing with mediocrity in public. In my opinion, as with SM, having people be patient with you and taking your own gradual steps is the way to overcome it. The only people I dance in front of are my children and husband and that is rarely. Just not comfortable with dancing and I am from the Caribbean where dancing is a big part of our culture. I am okay with having my West Indian card \"revoked\" because I do not dance. The only time I talk IS when I am singing, privately in bed. I sing in Japanese but I just sing to myself because no one would want to hear me sing and I used to dance when I was 10 and stopped and I have not danced since then. Everyone sees me as more of an artist and I see myself as an artist. It does not involve speaking. I think I would be embarrassed if I suddenly started doing performing arts I like to sing to myself in my car, or sometimes with someone I am really comfortable with. Singing by myself is the most comfortable though ahah\nI used to do ballet and tap dance when I was little but I do not think I would be comfortable casually dancing anywhere really, but probably would be the same concept as when I sing. I am completely recovered from SM but I will absolutely never sing or dance in public. If I am asked to I just stand still awkwardly. When you recover from SM there is still a lot of residual (social) anxiety, so it is pretty typical to still struggle with some things. I do sing/dance a lot on my own though I hardly ever do it in front of anyone (if I do, it is weirdly restrained). But I love singing and dancing alone. The first time I did both alone, I still totally felt self-conscious (with myself, which is weird).

Yup. Sure", "Hi, I am Ryan, ama! I looked around the boards here and, predictably, I am far older than the majority, mid-30s. I just thought that some of you might like to ask your senior a question or two. I know I am not the only 'recovered' SM here, but my insights are also bound to be different from theirs, so shoot. How were you able to recover from SM? How old were you when you recovered and how long did it took? Do you still have a little anxiety talking to people or are you very out going now? I had SM since I was a child and no one knew what it was, so I did not receive any treatment from it, I still am not and I am 18 now. It is not as bad as it was when I was a child where I just straight up not talk at school. I am in college now and I do talk but only when someone talks to me first and I find it extremely hard to join in conversation and I would just freeze up in certain social situation.   Simple, you age out. But anxiety really never leaves you, you learn to cope. Usually starts around 5ish I think, when kids start socializing, and leaves in a similar fashion around early 20s I was a pretty outgoing toddler so much so my parents put me on a leash. \n\nThink about how little was known about it in the '80s and '90s, what attention I did receive was directed towards my dyslexia and attention problems. Freezing up a lot could be a sign you are putting yourself out there, which is brave really. \n\nYour brain is not trained to reward social behavior, that is why you are an introvert. It insufficiently rewards you engaging efforts, and chastises you for your social foibles. \n\nThe biggest problem I see is that you are being too hard on yourself, do not be afraid to say the wrong thing or embarrass yourself. \n\nThere was a philosopher in ancient Greece called Diogenes, he was famous for pissing, shitting, and yes, even masturbating in public. He was from a branch of philosophy called cynicism which drives its name from the Greek word for dog. To be a dog from a human's perspective is to live a life free of care but full of the richest pleasures of love, gratitude for life and community. Learn to not care what other people think of you like Diogenes by learning to love yourself. Give yourself grace.\n\nWhere the rubber meets the road. You need to stop looking at your feet, let your feet do the walking. Similarly, stop looking at your mouth and let it do the talking. Your inner interlocutor, your conscious mind does not do the doing, you need to trust your body to carry the load. If you have nothing to say in conversation, so be it, maybe the people you hang out with are boring. You do not need to impress them with witty repartee. And let go of the urge to change yourself into someone else, the people who love you love you for you. And if you changed, you could end up losing the parts of yourself that made you special. If anyone helped you? Do you feel like they completely understood what SM was?\n\nI do not think my parents or family comprehend it to anywhere near a point, that is good enough to help me. My Mom focuses on Medicine as being the solution and with that, ignores any other route...when I have made it clear to her I do not want medicine. My family and other people are hard to talk to, but other people are easier.....though I do not strike up conversation with them at all. I only speak what is required. They also do not listen to what will help, when I do tell them things (although I can only tell them so much, without being able to tell them anything more).......I think my siblings understand better, though not enough.\n\nEdit: I think my talking was best before 10, and friend groups were ok (especially my most recent one).......after that it really developed into this stigma. Before that and before 10, I really just never found a need to talk, but could do it. Heck no. Lol I did not know what it was until I was about 20-21, a year before Big Bang Theory 1st aired. The people who helped me were my friends, my older brother, and myself. But really my greatest recourse was the internet.\n\nI would not recommend you rest your hope on the world informing to you. They will not understand. I am not a fan of medication but to each their own.\n\nI remember I remember once telling my parents that I was depressed after experiencing to depression for a few weeks, they yelled at me to get out form in front of the TV. I was like 8 or something, I was whiteknuckling clinical(undiagnosed) depression. \n\nWhat I learned is, probably not true for you, but in my own case, no help was coming.\n\nParents do not understand, they do not want to. They do not want there to be a problems in the first place, and if they are forced admit there is a problem they want it to go away as quickly and quietly as possible. \n\nNo my friend, you have to be the one to adapt. I have come to appreciate most all my aliments, from Introversion to depression to anxiety to you name it. They are what make me me and you you. \n\nSo I encourage you to become the master of your own fate. Do not ask, take the time and space you need. Stop apologizing and trust yourself. Stop rationalizing, your feelings are valid because they are your feelings, not because you can come up with a good excuse to have them. I did not see the edit before. 10 is around the age your hormones begin flaring up. That age is primetime as far as reproductivety is concerned.\n\nI would be a fool to offer too much advice thinking I could spare you the hardships puberty (do not know your age). Just keep your board waxed, hang ten, and ride the wave of your hormones. Best advice is to give yourself grace. That means forgiveness and mercy especially when you do not deserve it.

The intention I had in the post I had in mind was to both help/tell others how I gradually broke free from it, but also hoping that by answering question it can provide me a more linear and concrete explanation on how it  happened and why as I struggle to understand how it just happened exactly. I have gone from being the loner who had less friends than even the least popular groups and riddled with the most inhibiting social anxieties to being a more extroverted individual who now has no problem striking conversations with others, a deep understanding and confidence within myself and being able to befriend almost anyone.

Though in public they prefer sign to communicate with family.

I do not wear a mask, but I have started taking things with me that I can use to cover my face (mostly a plush that I can hide my face it). \n\nI communicate through bsl, writing and some body language (nodding, thumbs up/down, shake head, etc.) Ex sm so I will not answer the mask question (I mean, I do wear one and I do not see how SM would have any impact on someone is ability to wear one.)\n\n+ when I did have sm I was unable to communicate to the people I could not talk to. Sign language was never taught to me, although I doubt I would have been able to communicate with it even if I was. When I could not talk I also could not write, mouth words and even doing things like pointing or expressing emotions was difficult.\n\nFrom what I have read some people with sm are able to communicate using alternative non talking methods but many like me are not. 1. I wear a mask for covid, just staying home or when covid was not a thing yet I do not/did not. It actually makes me more anxious and through that makes my sm act up more, but I still do it.\n2. When I am mute I communicate through signed speech or simple signs, body language, pointing, and writing, no matter my mask situation. 1: I wear a mask as everyone else should. I feel more confident wearing a mask though if that is what you mean. \n\n2: speaking, since I am recovered. 1. I do wear a mask, i think it makes me more comfortable by covering my face although it does make me speak less since im worried people wont hear me speak\n2. I just try to talk as much as i can 1. I do wear a mask but people often dont understand me because i speak so quiet\n2. with words usually, as much as i can 1.

I know what I would say when I think about it before or after, but I cannot say it how I wanted or I just do not get the confidence to initiate something myself. On top of that, I do not have any social skills. I do not know how to express emotion, react, things like that. Are you diagnosed with Selective Mutism? Yes Okay. I have been too, and my SM is still very severe. I have other conditions on top of SM as well. What I usually do, is I write to people if I want to say something. I literally never speak outside my house because I am unable to. But I can otherwise communicate in writing, gestures or other ways! Yeah that is exactly how it would go for me. In my mind where everything tends to work a little more to how I want it to go....but in practice, I fail.

When I was at school I did not talk if I did not have the obligation to, I was always working by myself. \nSurprisingly I always made one friend in every class ( a new one every year, then I avoid the last one ), I honestly never knew why they wanted to stay with me at school... I barely talk they were the only one talking during conversations, I was just nodding or shrug and say \"Yes\" \"No\" or \"Ok\". I think it was either pity or they thought it was cool to being the only able to talk to me, but It does not matter they made the time pass faster anyway and they were kind and helpful to me.\nAlso I never go outside of my house except to go to school, so my definition of \"a friend\" is a bit different even if I considered myself close to them, we did not seem that close from the outside. Because they were hanging out with other friends outside of school.\n\nI am 17 now and not totally recovered from my possible SM but I clearly improved because for the first time this year I am in a class where nobody knew me and did not know that I usually do not talk so they started to talk to me normally ( it did not happened in a long time because of my \"quiet kid\" reputation) and surprisingly I talked to them back normally too ( \"normally\" is maybe a big word ). But it is been only a few months since I am in this class and I hope they will not assume I do not want to talk to them later this year because of my introversion, like a lot did back then. I honestly think I am just glad to finally be in a class of mature people.\n\n( In my childhood, I did not had trouble to communicate with others even with my introversion I had a little group of friends and was outgoing with them. ) I am also suspecting an \"avoidant personality disorder\" or the \"asperger syndrome\".", "Does anyone else wish they were fully mute? Sometimes I feel like it would be easier than selective mutism, or trying to recover from selective mutism. It sucks trying to explain that I am only mute when anxious. People tell me just to talk. If I could not talk at all people would not be this way towards me. I am just so tired of my selective mutism sometimes. I used to feel this so hard when I was younger. There is not enough awareness about SM, which makes it hard to explain to classmates and teachers, and then being an adult trying to register for a bank account and doing other adult things that require in-person social interaction... Everything is hell. It sucks not being able to explain it to other people. I really wish there was more representation like you said, so then people would actually be more understanding of people who have SM. Not really, I feel like maybe people would get it more than they do, but it is still so uncommon. I think you would just find another set of problems....idk No. I wish I could talk normally. I kind of get this feeling, you tell someone you have selective mutism and they do not know what it is or do not think it is real, but if your mute it feels like they will make an effort and make an exception for you to feel comfortable, But I get what your saying I just wish I did not get so exhausted to tho point of just going mute cause I am tired of talking. I have never even explained this to the people around me cause I know they would say the same thing, so I force it even though I have to take longer pauses then usual and then I get so burnt out.

Personally, anxiety and SM are curses. They ruined my life, and continue to do so. I cannot think of them as \"unique and lovable\" characteristics.\n\nThat text has been stuck in my head since I first read it. It made me realize how much they do not know about me, despite all the time I have known them and the amount of personal life stuff we share.

Hello, maybe a year or two ago I started to have this strange problem of not being able to start a conversation at school or certain places although I can with someone else I wanted to ask you if this is selective mutism in a short time I will go to the psychiatrist as this has brought me fear to speak although if I can answer or help even if it is only short words it feels like I have no air and physically I can not speak, should I ask the psychiatrist directly about this diagnosis?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTw If you have the means try to find a Dr or therapist with experience in SM near your location.  Therapists and doctors with experience in selective mutism will probably list it separately so it can help when using google to find someone local.\n\nGood luck. I do not think there are specialists in my area, that is why I was asking if it could be that I have this disorder anyway, someone not specialized could help me. We are not doctors, we cannot diagnose you, sorry. Are you sure there are not any specialists in your area? Have you checked? Maybe, the only thing that could happen is that I will not be diagnosed with SM although I am pretty sure I have it for quite some time and I did not even know what it was until I searched the same reddit because I could not talk to any unknown or not so unknown person.

I am currently in the process of writing a story where the main character has selective mutism and I would love some input from those who are pre-teen/teenaged and in school. I want to make sure I am representing the character in the right way, especially since it is from his POV. I actually cried when I started writing because I used to have very severe social anxiety and was trying to remember how I used to think in certain situations, and it was all coming back fuzzy. I cannot believe how far I have come. I would love to pm some specific questions if anyone is open to that, but feel free to just comment general experiences, I really appreciate the help. hi! as a fellow writer and a 16 year old who is had SM since age 10 ish (diagnosed at 12) i am happy to help!! feel free to pm me if i can help, and i will paste some of my general tips below :)\n\nhere is a tumblr post i made on the subject a while back: \n\nthe SMart center which has always been a good resource for me: \n\nand some good insta accounts are   and \n\nhope i can help!! :) Howdy! I am open to pm questions as well! I own characters of my own as I am an animator. I am currently 14 but turning 15 in a month and I was diagnosed at around 7 years old. One experience i can share is how whenever in public people do not know I have sm cause i basically act as a mime and do over exaggerated movements so when they finally ask me to talk or why i do not I just totally freeze up. When I was younger i would not communicate verbally or nonverbally and would just basically sit in the corner. I have pm\u2019d you already because it was not letting me comment on this post for some reason, but it is now, I am 17 and was diagnosed around 8, its got a lot better now in the last year so I would be happy to answer any questions or I can just give you a general view whichever is better :)", "SM I have an appointment with a lcsw to address it but I still feel so hopeless. It seems like lately it has got a lot worse. I think partly because at my last job, my boss had a belief that \"women should be seen, not heard\" and so i was basically ignored or sometimes punished for speaking at all. Lately, I feel like I cant even talk to my closest friends anymore and its got to where it used to be only in person mostly but lately, I cant even type things to them half the time. I feel like I just embarass myself when i speak a lot or that no one cares or people talk over me and so I give up. It seems like it just reinforces my anxiety. I just dont know what to do. I have an appointment soon because this is starting to ruin my life and make me not want to be around my friends or leave my house anymore. I guess I just needed to talk about it and I feel like I can say whatever on here as its semi-anonymous. Do you guys feel this way?", "Do I have SM? I see a lot people ask this, so ai decided too as well\n\nI have always been shy, I think its mainly because I have moved 5 schools /next year will be sixth/ and moved through 3 different countries. Generally, I hate meeting people and always have and meeting people all the time made me stop speaking.\nI also whisper a lot and got shouted at a lot for not being loud enough. \nMy mother recently found out about me passing notes and such instead of speaking and I am going to therapy now, but I am too scared to ask if my therapist knows what SM is because I feel like she will feel like I am faking it - I just keep overthinking a lot. \nTheres a lot more to add to the story, but did not want to make this too long. \n\nSo, what do you think? Do I have Selective Mutism? Hello, you appear to have asked a question about whether you have selective mutism. \n\nWe can help you understand selective mutism with ( Please remember that our members can only give you an opinion on whether you meet the criteria for selective mutism, not a diagnosis. If you would like to be properly assessed, it is highly recommended to see a medical professional. ( section of the wiki.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/selectivemutism) if you have any questions or concerns.* I need to break the silence, but do not know if I should It depends, do you not like to speak, or you incapable of speaking? If you just do not like to speak because you are very shy but still can speak if you absolutely had too then no. But if you physically cannot get words out even if you need too then that could be SM. I definitely recommend bringing it up with a therapist or doctor. Some people do not know what SM is so be careful and good luck ^^ In the beginning it was just because I did not want too, but over the last 3 years I became completely incapable of speaking. Even if I want too now, I choke up and stutter before running away or start crying\nI will probably try and mention it to my therapist as well.\nThanks for the comment!", "i relate  That but add lots of shaking and possible tears. Do not forget the constant blushing that feels like your skin being burnt alive (T\u0296\u032fT) Oh my, I thought I was the only one turning into a cherry.  \nI hate people thinking I like them (I am female so going by stereotypes males.) Like no Kevin I am gay", "How do I bring up mutism with therapist? I struggle talking with my therapist and I feel that we are getting nowhere after weeks of trying. I did say that I had trouble talking, but hes treating it as just normal shyness about big things, like presentations. \n\nHe has not even diagnosed me with any conditions or meds despite me obviously needing them, but idk how therapy usually works so maybe I am just impatient.\n\nHow do I go about bringing this up? Do I just mention selective mutism or do I describe what I am feeling? And how do I make myself talk in order to communicate this? How have you been communicating with them so far? I answer yes or no over the phone. At times I can elaborate with a short sentence or so, but that is it. I struggle to even answer questions and such. If you have a way to text or email your therapist, that might be a good approach. Or it could help to write down what you want to say ahead of time. I do not think I can text/ email him, but I will bring it up next time. Writing down ahead of time is a great idea, but how do I get myself to bring it up? I have tried writing things down before but get too scared to actually ask him about it. Do you think text/email would help you open up a lot more? Show them this post? Idk how I would, it is all over phone. I guess I could if I ask for his email tho. Yeah. Texting is way easier for me. I think I will try to gather the courage to ask about switching to a text-based or email-based session instead Try to explain it as not being physically able to speak, or not remembering how to, or your mind going blank, whichever is most accurate. It affects different people differently, but try to describe how it feels, sensations and emotions.\n\nAs far as how to actually say it without going mute, do not worry about it. I mentioned it to my therapist a few times, but going non verbal in the middle of a session was actually what helped her understand. If you end up not being able to talk while trying to explain not being able to talk, you are just illustrating your point, in some ways more effectively. My only real advice is to try, so your therapist can see the effort, too. It sucks in the moment, but it does help in the long run. It helps you communicate with your therapist better, and by extension get help communicating with others. Thank you, that was actually the most helpful reply so far.  I have gone mute several times while trying to answer situations he gave me, but I will try. Hopefully he will understand.", "What teachers should know about helping students with Selective Mutism.  OH MY GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS. I am a teacher who is struggled with selective mutism all my life and I was looking for resources to help educate my other fellow teachers with and this is perfect. I never want another student to have to go through what I went through in high school and college. Thanks so much for posting this\ud83d\udc95", "I find it physically hard to speak. Is this SM? I genuinely cannot get words out when I am around my parents. I can still say one word or the smallest amount of words possible. \n\nI am able to say things like \"fridge\" when the my parents forget to close the fridge for too long, or \"TV\" when it is off and I want it on, or \"yes\" and \"no\", and to make grunts and noises to show approval/disapproval. But I cannot form a full sentence for the life of me. Sometimes I absolutely have to, but even then it is extremely condensed to the least amount of words possible. Even then, it takes a while to get the sentence out in the first place, because it feels like I have to drag each sound out of my own mouth. \n\nI can talk fine around friends and other people my age, but I will not talk to people much older than me unless extremely necessary. The only exception to that are my doctor and my therapist.\n\nI never talked in school unless I really needed to get something out.\nSometimes I get repetitive thoughts that I need to write down or speak out loud, otherwise they will keep echoing and make me feel like my head is exploding.\nWhen I am unable to get them out, I often resort to grunting and making noise by hitting things to drown them out. Of course this upsets people around me, but I cannot explain to them what the problem is because, if I were to speak, it would just be the thought, and not an explanation as to why I am upset.\n\nPresentations went okay for the most part, but sometimes I would feel like I could not get words out anymore and stop talking in the middle of them. I would still drag some keywords out (like with my parents).\n\nI speak a lot when I am alone at home and even sing, but sometimes I will stay completely silent because it feels like I just cannot speak, no matter what. maybe. are you generally socially anxious as well? We can by no means diagnose you, but I can tell you that feeling like the words are stuck or like you are physically unable to speak in social settings is definitely textbook SM. It is not uncommon to be unable to write either. With SM, essentially your brain paralyzes the vocal cords and muscles in perceived \u201cdangerous\u201d scenarios (social settings) as a defence mechanism, and you are unable to speak. It typically comes along with feelings of social anxiety as well, which is another key thing for diagnosis. I am having the same issues", "Is it okay for me to tell people I have selective mutism even though I have not been diagnosed? I cannot speak in front of people unless it is family, and I usually have my family speak for me instead. But sometimes people keep trying to force me to speak and it makes me so anxious I hate it. I feel like telling them I have selective mutism or something will make them stop trying to force me, but I do not know if it is okay to do that. I cannot get diagnosed because my parents would not be willing to spend money on something like that, and it is not like I want to go outside anyway.\n\nso I would just like to know if that would be okay, or if there is some other way to make them stop. are you sure it will not come back to bite you in the butt if you tell family friends or whoever that you have SM and they tell your family? or would your family not care that you self diagnosed? just something to consider.\n\n\notherwise i feel mixed on the subject. i mean, you should do whatever helps you be more comfortable, but i think a strong skill to learn is to just let respectfully set your boundaries and not continue to engage with people who push past them. you do not need a medical \"excuse\" to not want to talk to people. you can just set whatever boundaries you are comfortable with and just not interact with people if they continue to try to force you to talk.\n\n\nif i tell someone that i am not okay with  behavior and they continue to do it, i just leave. i do not care if it seems rude or anything, i think it should be encouraged to stick to your boundaries. yyou're right my siblings probably would not like that. \nand just sometimes I just cannot walk away from a situation, like before when I used to go to school and a teacher would try and get me to speak I could not just leave I used to just stand there and get really stressed and I would just end up feeling anxious the whole day.\n\nOr if a relative is trying to talk to me I just nod or shake my head and if they keep pushing, again it stresses the shit out of me and I do not know what to tell them, I do not know why I cannot speak. You sound like you have selective mutism. You could find some information on SM to give to your family. Tell them that this is what you think you have and how it affects you. They should be more willing to love and accept your boundaries, and try their best to be supportive and respectful. id recomend getting on the diagnosis process firest E.G. i have not been offociall diagnosed but mutiple professionals involed with me say yeah, and im treated as if i have it so if i have to saw it i will, but first i will come out wiht other excuese that i have been diagnosed with.\n\nbut once your on the diagnosis process id say your more than fair to as theres clearlily been inkling by you recognised by some professionals to say yeah, and in my country wiating lists are years so you may aswell say that in the mean time\n\nbut do what ever feels most comfortable with you I personally would try to get diagnosed. It not like you want to go around telling people you have an allergy to peanuts but realize they were actually almonds. \n\nLike another person said, you should look up information on selective mutism and show your parents. Explain your situation clearly and as detailed as you possibly can. \n\nDo not be like \u201cI 100% have selective mutism.\u201d Instead you should say \u201cI might have selective mutism *shows information*, can I please get diagnosed?\u201d Oh alright\nit makes me scared thinking about it but I will try to talk to them some day Yeah you are right.\n\nI am just scared to try and talk to them because I do not think they will care because we never talk about stuff like that. My parents saw my scars once and they said I was doing it for attention even though I just do it so I can keep emotions away and function normally so that too makes me scared of saying anything. No pressure. If it helps, you can practice on your own until you are ready. By the way, I will do that too since I am planning to tell my therapist that I have SM.\n\nI wrote down a list of all my symptoms I experience. It did make my mom understand me better. that is so good to hear!! I am proud of you!", "Perspective with SM as a child in school Hey guys! \n\nI have been through a lot in my 23 years. But the worst thing I have had to go through out of everything is SM. I no longer have it, but I still get bad anxiety, and feel super shy at work. \n\nWhenever I feel down, all I can think about is how I went years, YEARS without talking at school. At most a few words on a good day. It makes me so sad. It is almost mind blowing. I just get so sad because, I feel like I missed out on so much I that can never get back. \n\nI hate when people say lots of people are shy. It is more than that. Imagining wanting to talk so bad but, not being able to. Feeling like you could have been so much more if you could just let the words out.\n\nHow many more friends you could if had. How much more fun you could of had. How much happier you could of been. That guy who used to like you, you could of gotten him if you just spoke up. It was just so hard. \n\nAs a kid, I never felt good enough because I couldnt speak up, and say what I wanted. As an adult, that low self esteem is still there. I never feel good enough, and feel less than everyone else. I have come a long way. I can talk freely but, I over analyze everything. I just want to gain confidence. \n\nI do not know what this rant is about. This is just some stuff that often crosses my mind. How behind I got at school because I could not ask for help and now I just suck at math and will never catch up. Yeah, it sucks. Me! I remember in physics I was too scared to tell the teacher I could not read the board from my seat. Failed all the quizzes in silence hey! first, congrats on your recovery! as you said, you have come a long way! the rough path is now behind, those friends are no longer there or that guy lol be proud of what you did and look to new horizons, life do get better! and one day, you will look behind and see a better path, the rough one being far far away. As I kid at school, I used to count the words I spoke that day, now I think about that and I smile. it brings me joy to see how far I have come. I am now in a relationship! and guess what? I talk a lot more than my SO!! feel free to PM me if you feel like to chat. This could be written by me lol, I am 18 now and it is my final year in school. I do not have a single friend and I can only speak normally around my mum, two of my sisters and a brother in law. \nI only say a few words at school, and that is only if someone else says something to me first. \nI cannot even say hi to someone unless they say hi to me first. It sucks because I really want to talk to my classmates, they are so awesome and I often think about what it would be like if I was normal. \n\nI feel like I have wasted what should have been some of the best years in my life, and I am worried that even if my selective mutism gets \u2018fixed\u2019, I will still be plagued by social... incompetence? lol... I feel you. Are you going to college at all? College is where I found myself. I did not start talking really until senior year of high school. I just got so mad somehow it happened. I still do not know how I did it somedays. I really just eventually would think of what I would say next time in that situation. Well I live in sweden so the school system is a bit different, after this year I guess I will be going to university. When I did start talking my voice was high pitched. It still happens sometimes when I get nervous. Working at a restaurant and being forced to talk to people helped too. Good practice Awww I love that thank you. Haha I actually work an inside sales now and make calls for a living with is the funny part :) Oh that is awesome! I am in US. Private message me sometime I would love to chat :) Yeah, I had problems in seeing the board a lot of times, now I use glasses, but before I couldn\u00b4t copy a lot of things. Oh my god, the whole feeling like you are missing out on friends and other opportunities is so frustratingly accurate. It is awful thinking all of those \"if only i spoke\" thoughts and beating yourself up over it I have done it so much lol i relate to this 100%. i guess i am \u201cfine\u201d now with the exception of having bad social anxiety, but it makes me sad that my childhood was thrown away because of something i could not control. I get what you mean. People were always like you do not have it that bad, just talk. It was so frustrating. Tbh at times my mom would yell at me and make me feel guilty for not talking. When I bring it up to her now she gets mad. Sometimes I think her force and making me feel guilty helped me get out of my shell. It hurt a lot at the time tho :/", "How to cope with this? Was just diagnosed with this by my psychiatrist have never heard of this before until today. I knew I had social phobia but not this too it is just shocking but it makes sense in my case. \n\nSo is there anything that could help? Do I need to see a psychologist that specializes in anxiety? Therapy? I do not know When I got diagnosed, I started off with therapy for anxiety. It is been working slowly but there is progress. If part of a reason of why you cannot speak is not knowing exactly what to say in situations, then I highly recommend speech therapy. Speech therapy could also be extremely helpful if you do not have that issue. There is a lot of different types of speech therapy so I think you should look into that thanks i will look into that Sounds weird but screaming can really help. It is a therapy that I forgot the name of that can soothe speaking related anxieties. You can do it into a pillow or something that will muffle the sound.", "Therapy I just wanted to share what my therapist said to me in a one sided conversation. \n\n\"It is called selective mutism. But you are not mute. You are selecting to be mute. That is why it is called selective mutism. This is not even anxiety. You are avoiding communication. Why did you decide to stop talking?\" - Therapist\n\nLater I got up to throw the paper I was given to write on away. \"Why is that easier than talking?\" Eww. Therapy is ridiculous. That therapist knows nothing about sm, he made the same assumption that people who do no research but want to seem like they know what sm is make \"this isnt even anxiety\"\n \nWhat the fuck??? Lol wtf this just makes me so mad. They seriously have no idea what it is like. Not anxiety? That is the whole reason why we cannot. \u201cThat is why it is called selective mutism\u201d That misconception is why the term was changed from elective mutism because people assumed it meant you were electing to be mute. That is fucking infuriating That is why I hate the term selective mutism, it implies that we choose to be mute. I only choose to not talk maybe 10% of the time when I sense a mutism episode coming and stop talking to try and prevent it since episodes are usually related to lack of energy for me \"selective\" does not mean consciously selective \"This is not even anxiety\" is not selective mutism an anxiety disorder or something though? and that is why I stopped going to therapy, half of them are not worth it, finding a great therapist seems as hard as finding a good relationship someone needs to review their DSM V handbook. So unprofessional. This person sounds uneducated on selective mutism. I would be mad Seriously, screw therapists and doctors. I have been called retarded and dumb too many times to count. Try therapists from a country which is not America. I have heard that they need only a few months of training, whereas in other countries you need things like a degree and years of training to get the position.", "thanksimcured   \"Just say one word, say hi\" Okay sure, I will just get over my crippling anxiety, just for you... lmaooo yes reminds me of when people tell anorexic or food avoidant individuals to 'just eat more' like how silly can people be? This meme is everything \"Just do it. Even if it makes you want to throw up, do it.\"\n\nUmm, yeah. I wish it was that easy \"well you are going to have to talk one day. How are you going to get a job if you cannot talk\"\n\nOh shit you right Oh god, I have been told that before. It just made me feel so much worse about being unable to speak, which is saying something because I beat myself up about it constantly. Like, do not you think I *know* I will not be able to get a job? I had SM growing up. My dad always told people that he was not worried, he knew I would grow out of it eventually. My parents never pressured me to talk. \"He will talk when he is ready\" was a very common phrase. Of course it is not as easy as \"just doing it\" but for me it was about be being fed up with the anxiety and finding the courage to \"just do it\" I HATED when people told me this. It was like they thought that in all my years of not talking, I had never considered the fact that I was going to have to get a job someday. Like I thought about it all the time and it FILLED me with anxiety and then saying that made me feel worse, not only because they were reminding me of that, but also because they were dismissing my pain and reading it as laziness and irresponsibility and a choice. @ teachers and coworkers Or they ask what you want to do and no matter what you say their response is \"yoU kNOw yUO hAvE tO TalK foR ThAT riGHt?\" I know. It is insane the the things people think are appropriate to say. If they knew what SM was, I do not think they would talk like that, but because they view it as a choice or a quirk, say say the meanest shit. r/thanksimcured lmao if only lmaoo yes, when I told my classmates nobody believed me, even though I communicated with them most of the time writing, so I started to tell instead that I have a stutter, which I really have a little bit when I can  speak I once went in to an appointment with my mum and she herself had trouble , mum had told the doctor as we walked in I had SM\n\nDoctor turns to me 5 mins in, asks me a question and when I do not respond says \",we really need you to talk in order to help your mum\"\nGEE DONT YOU THINK I KNOW? Does this apply to regular social anxiety disorder too?", "What is your selective mutism story? WARNING: long story. If you do not want to read, you can skip down and just comment your story.\n\nWhen I started preschool I remember my teacher asking me if I wanted something. I nodded my head but it was clearly not enough. \"Use your words\" she said, and I remember my heart racing and the fear and panic I felt. I froze and did not say anything, so she gave up and just handed it to me. I did not talk to a single person, not even my friends. At home though, I spoke absolutely fine, yet the moment we left the door I clung onto my mom, never letting go of her hand, and sealed my mouth shut the entire time. Also, not going into too much details, but in the middle of preschool my parents divorced. Before this, I lived for almost a year alone with my mom and, well, let us just say I experienced tons of anxiety due to some things she did. Not sure if this further contributed to how I am now, ya know, with all those 'underlying causes from early childhood that mess up kids later'. Anyways, near the end of preschool I was talking to some friends. I also recall babbling away to one teacher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to let us say, grade 4. I was more confident than ever. I raised my hand, could easily have a conversation with the teacher and all of my classmates. I even desperately raised my hand to get a role in a school play we were doing. I remember volunteering to read something on stage through a microphone to the entire school. When I got up, I was kind of nervous, and remember thinking, \"Oh, is this that feeling of having butterflies in your stomach?\". But I got over it, and bravely read my paper out to the school. Again, I was titled as \"shy\" and \"quiet\" but I could still talk fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, grade 6 came, the worst year of my life. You know those usual, you-make-friends-with-someone-but-they-turn-out-to-be-really-mean stories? Yup, this was that. Me and my best friend made friends with this girl. She was absolutely nice at first, then changed entirely. First, she started out by making fun of us, and constantly judging us. Calling us ugly and weird and judging every aspect of our clothes and face and the way we walked etc. Then things got absolutely worse, she told random guys I liked them and spread rumours throughout our entire grade. I was embarrased to even walk, having people constantly talk behind my back and to my face. On top of that, I was extremely self-conscious due to her constant judging. She judged EVERYTHING, right down to the way I walked. At this time, I was often mad at that girl inside my heart and would often cry at school (no teacher bothered to ask me what is wrong) but that is all, and in no way was I ever depressed. Also, for the first time in my life I started shaking during a presentation, and it had scared me so badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, in grade 7 I moved schools. I was finally away from the girl and could breathe. I did not talk much to my classmates (and never the guys), I never raised my hand in class, but I still could talk. I also met my 2 friends, who were very confident and loud and it caught onto me. Man, did we have fun. The 3 of us were so hyper, but I still made sure to calm myself down in front of a teacher and the guys. I was not silent; when a teacher asked me anything I openly responded in full sentences. In grade 8 though, those friends were in a different class. I slowly lost my confidence. I felt extremely self-conscious, and the words of the bullying from grade 6 were getting to my head. My social anxiety increased and I started getting depressed. Grade 6 circulated my mind, and even my parents divorce was getting to my head as well and I cried for the FIRST time over it, wondering why I was so worthless that even my own mom didnt love me and left me. My anxiety increased and I started falling back into my old silence. I never spoke a word to any one, no classmate and no teacher, except for my friends. Social anxiety and depression were severely consuming me, as well as my SM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn grade 9, I had the same teacher from grade 7. After about 1 month in, she could clearly tell something was wrong, as I had turned silent and got concerned. One day, I got called to the counselors office and she said my teacher was worried and stuff, and I should get counselling to gain my confidence. During parent-teacher meeting my teacher said I was quiet before, but not this quiet, and can tell somethings wrong etc. Well, my parents refused conselling cause they dont trust counsellors. Dunno how this worked, but they got out of it somehow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I am in high school (here its grades 10-12). In the first year, I had a presentation and the class was much bigger than usual. I was so nervous, that when I presented my hands visibly shook, my voice sounded like I was going to cry, and the words were a mumble (first time this happened). My group after asked me if i was okay. This repeatedly happened presentation after presentation, to the point that my hands fell asleep (it occurs due to hyperventilation, because not enough oxygen goes to your body including hands) and well, hyperventilating. Its humiliating to have the class see you like this. Also, often when a teacher called on me to talk there would be laughter. On top of this, I was constantly being lectured by teachers for not talking, one saying that \"people will judge me if I am like this\". At this point, SM has completely taken over and I am now absolutely silent in school, except and only to my friends when we are alone and I am also slowly starting to talk less at home as well. I definitely think SM needs more awareness. Your story is almost identical to mine thank you for sharing this! i definitely see some parallels between your story and mine. I wholeheartedly agree that there needs to be more awareness with SM, too many people pass it off as just being shy or something that we will eventually grow out of. I do not think it is anything to be ashamed about either, people ultimately need to learn how to be more accommodating and less presumptuous.  Fair warning this is going to be pretty long...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was 4 when I started Kindergarten and when everyone realized that I was not like my siblings. I did not talk, not one word, even nodding my head was difficult, they called me a statue because I would look dead ahead with no expressions at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 years old and we changed shcools, a new environment a new beginning? Not so, the same thing even though I had my siblings and cousins at this school. The teacher did not know what to do, my parents did not know what to do. Mental Health services were unheard of on my Island.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is rebellious, she just does not want to, she is rude, is she being abused?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey sent me to the teacher for Special Education students everyone from Students with Dyslexia to students with Mental Retardation were shoved into one class. I spent my time drawing and day dreaming. I did not belong in this classrom so she shuffled me back to regular ed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is smart but she does not talk, she can do the work but she does not participate in class, one girl befriended me then another, they were very nice to me but I did not understand how to play with them. I did not run around with the other kids or giggle or laugh. I stood on the outside watching them be kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first girl who became my friend moved away so now it was just me and my other friend who became my best friend, she would come visit my house and I would visit hers, I would whisper to her and we would laugh. It went from whispers to full speech and then we were in 5th grade. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were sitting together, whispering in class and being like the other students but I still did not speak to other people. My grandmother passed away and my mother was pregnant with my 5th sibling. The teacher moved me and my best friend apart and my grades started slipping, I lost interest in everything. Looking back I was in mourning but nobody noticed and I fell into a crack. I failed 5th grade and was held back. I made it through the rest of Elementary (On our Island Elementary is from Kindergarden to 6th grade 5 years old to 10/11 years old) mostly numb. My best friend had moved and gotten new friend so I sat alone and did nothing while others laughed and played.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJunior High (7th and 8th grade 12-13 years old) \n\nI am still numb and do not really care about school, I do the bare minimum so my parents can get off my back. It is not enough and I fail another grade, I went to Summer school and failed that too. I am in 7th grade again.\n\nThis 7th grade is different I have a teacher who talks down to the students and I want to prove her wrong so I ace everything put in front of me I am doing so well they want to induct me into the School's High Achievers club but I do not want that attention. I also spoke for the first time when my teacher calls me by my sisters name. \n\nI am in 8th grade now one of the oldest in my class but people do not realize it because I look like one of the youngest. I am in Honors Classes and my mother is pregnant with my 6th sibling. My grandfather passes away and it hurts because I have never met him but another blows comes when 9/11 happens on the same day my baby sister is stillborn...\n\nI am struggling in Honors class but I am still maintaining a grade that keeps me out of regular classes. I wish I had opted to leave Honors but I stuck with it. I am slowly speaking in class but I am still the most quiet person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made it through Jr High and then High School, I speak when spoken to but I am quiet, I am diagnosed with Selective Mutism and Social Anxiety and on the Spectrum possibly Asperger's. My father and youngest are diagnosed with Asperger's so I am not only in my plight afterall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly 20s I am expanding my circle and discovering the internet I make friends and learn to speak on the phone and call people even do video chats. People think I am very outgoing until they meet me in person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am now in my early 30s and living in a new country dealing with SM again this time in learning to speak French...\n\n&amp;#x200B; I was initially diagnosed with autism, it was not until a special needs teacher said that i had very few autism symptoms that a SM diagnosis was made. I remember being in the special needs class at school, which was probably beneficial to no one in the group, which involved daily phyical violence/screaming/chairs being thrown by some of the other students and singing sessions instead of being taught how to write and spell properly.\n\nTeachers also made very little effort to research SM after being told about it and as i got older i was told that it was \u201cno longer cute\u201d and \u201cnot much of an excuse at your age\u201d.\n\nI was lucky in that i \u2018grew out\u2019 of SM, despite still having issues (i threw up and started crying during a presentation at uni)\n\nI agree that awareness would be so helpful in helping others have patience when working and speaking with those with SM as well as opening the door to developing more effective treatment. \n\n I am not going share my whole story here because it is a bit of a mess, but feel free to browse through my comment history. I see my own story in some of yours. I was building some confidence with regards to talking in 3rd and 4th grade, but it all shut down in 5th and 6th grade. Unfortunately, that is the point where my childhood friends starting deciding they were too cool for me and I became much more socially isolated. Also around that point, my parents divorced. The isolation I experienced fed the anxiety and the anxiety fed the isolation. Anxiety took more and more control of my life until residential anxiety treatment in my second year of high school.\n\nI am very concerned about your parents not wanting you to see a counselor. I am not saying that your parents are abusive, but barring off the option of therapy or counseling for someone with a serious but treatable anxiety disorder is an act of neglect. It is your parents responsibility to make sure you are as healthy as possible (including mental health) and your parents sadly seem to be failing you in that regard.\n\nTherapy or counseling would not just be getting you to talk more, it would be about teaching you valuable life skills, boosting your confidence, and easing your suffering. Is there any way that you can advocate for yourself and let the school counselor or a teacher know that you *do* want help, even if your parents do not want you to get help? There might be ways to go over your parents' heads, so to speak.\n\nAnxiety disorders are not something to be dismissed because your parents are picky about who they trust and they *do* tend to get worse over time without treatment. It sounds like you are doing pretty good to push through the anxiety in some situations and I am proud of that. At the same time, counseling could make your life a whole lot easier.\n\nI do not want to see another person with SM fall deeper into that black hole of fear and isolation. I know how painful it is from my own experience. There are ways to learn manage your anxiety through therapies like CBT and exposure therapy. Even just reading a book on CBT could provide you with some skills to better manage your anxiety. You do not need to carry the burden of all this anxiety if you get the proper help. I am sorry you are struggling and I hope things get better. In elementary school the kids knew me as the one who does not talk. Throughout my k-8 years I would have different confidants that I could talk to. I guess some how the teachers internalized this reputation. I do not think anybody knew a thing about SM. I was just accepted as one of the weird kids. They never called on me to speak much. Class participation was not part of the curriculum at this time.  \n\nFor the most part, other kids would try to force me to speak. Of course that never worked. In 5th grade a few classmates got me speaking comfortably. I guess they some how talked to me like a normal person in a way that bypassed whatever mental blocks were there. For the teacher, it was her first time teaching a full classroom. She was some what unconventional and had the young go getter attitude. This was a stark contrast to previous years where the teachers were indifferent or very very strict. One so strict to the point where I was having anxiety attacks before leaving the house.  \n\nThis marked the beginning of a period from 5th to 8th grade where the SM looking better. High school came around and everything fell apart. I went from a small k-8 school of a few hundred students to a high school of thousands. The worst part was that the attitude of most of my classmates from elementary school was completely different. Nobody was nice to me anymore. Some completely forgot they knew me. A couple of bullies from elementary knew my deal and made my life hell.  \n\nThings were regressing backward to the point where I was not even talking to my parents anymore. My parents took me to the doctors but never sought further treatment. I think they were only concerned that I go to university. Then maybe things will sort itself out.  \n\nI hated high school and my grades were bad. I barely got accepted into university so off I went to that. I had four or five people I could talk to throughout the four years. Other people tried to reach out to me but I could not speak to them. There were some publicly embarrassing moments throughout university. I some how graduated university. I was mentally and emotionally drained.  \n\nThe SM was worse than it had ever been up to then. I think must have slept for 2 months straight after the final exam. I barely applied any jobs in the following years. I had only a few interviews which were all horrible. I had never had a job before much less searched for one before graduating.  \n\nThe years just went on fast forward. My degree stopped landing me phone calls back. That is when I knew it had become too long after graduation. So that brings us to current day.   I remember in kindergarten there were times where I would not have had a problem talking but instead of just asking me things and calling on me like a normal person, my teacher would try to trick me into talking so I would not say anything just to spite her. The next year I had a better teacher and I started talking much more.", "Has anyone found someone that they are comfortable not being nonverbal around? I can and do talk if I have to, but as most you will understand, I find it incredibly uncomfortable and draining. My immediate family is mostly great about this and although secondary school was a big challenge, mostly due to the students, 6ft form has been fine. \n\nA few months ago I started talking to a woman on here. I made a post about my autism and nonverbal and she sent me a chat request and we got on really well. Also found out she lives not too far from me and we up and have been boyfriend and girlfriend ever since. \n\nThe weird thing is, I am basically not nonverbal around her. I was a little shy at first because I would basically never spoken to a women properly before, but we bonded over her own autism and similar mental health needs. Taking outloud to her just does not feel anywhere near as draining and we have even spoken on the phone which I have only ever done a few times before and never more than a few words. \n\nHas anyone else experienced similar where they either stop being nonverbal or find people where their anxieties are not triggered as much with? I am not autistic and I was only ever nonverbal at school or extracurriculars. My mom joked when she found out I did not speak at school \"how do I get her to stop talking at home\".... this was the 90s so i obviously did not get help.\n\nBut yes, I speak perfectly fine with those I feel comfortable around. Yes there have been a handful of people throughout the years that I have felt comfortable talking with My childhood best friend and my twin are pretty much the only people I talk to completely normally I tend to get along better with other neurodivergent people. I usually notice I can just talk to them with much less effort right off the bat. Once in 6th grade I made two friends and I somehow became verbal around most of my classmates even though we were not friends. It was truly the greatest thing I ever experienced. I also had a friend in 3rd-4th grade who I was verbal with, but we did not see eachother too often. Those are the only two instances in my life though.", "What are some experiences you have had with friendships being ruined because of SM? There was a group of people I was friends with my freshman year of college that I hung out with a lot at first because we were all on the same floor of our dorm building. I liked them a lot, especially this one guy that I had a lot in common with. But my roommate was part of the same friend group and he hated me, mostly because I was awkward and did not talk to him much. Everyone else in the friend group grew close while I still barely talked to them. It became clear i was not really part of the group. My roommate invited everyone in that friend group except me to go to his parents extra house or something (they worked in another city but were from wherever this house was and still went back there sometimes) for a weekend. It was clear that they did not care about me and did not really want me around. The one friend that I mentioned before that I was closest with becaus ewe had a lot in common even got mad at me for not talking to him more and I tried to explain but I did not even know what selective mutism was at the time and I did not do a good job of it. I miss all of them but I feel like they never even think about me. Nobody ever got mad at me. Most just feel sad for me, and themselves. The only friend I managed to keep for an extended period of time leaves most of her friends, so she does not get upset if I do not talk to her for 3 months. The rest eventually fade away as they find out I cannot offer them the reliability they need I had some groups of friends, but as I grew older I started to get more alone because I was basically ashamed of being somewhere where I could only hear, they kind of accepted me and almost never talked with me directly (which was nice), but it was too embarrasing for me.", "Girlfriend with selective mutism I am pretty sure my GF has selective mutism I am not a doctor but she shares a lot of the same symptoms so I just wanted to ask, how should I go about talking to her when she chooses to be mute or stress triggered her to be mute? Should I leave her be, try to comfort her, read to her? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I am new to this whole thing and I am very confused :( She does not choose to be mute, it is probably beyond her conscious control. Show that you are there for her, that you support her. You can always search for new ways to communicate with her.\n\nPerhaps writing is easier for her? She could use her phone or a little notebook.  \nSome people with SM prefer sign language, perhaps try to learn that?  \nYou can always try yes and no questions, perhaps she can nod/shake her head.\n\nAnd of course, it would be wise to visit a doctor/psychiatrist. That is how I overcame my SM. It is a long journey, but it will be worth it.\n\nThe more she feels pressured, the harder it is to talk. Try to be cool about it, she is trying her best. Good luck to you two! Ask her when she can talk. Everyone is different, everyone copes and wants to handle things differently. Maybe she wants you there supporting her, maybe she wants physical comfort, maybe she wants to be alone. If you pick the wrong thing, you will usually make it worse, and you cannot be psychic. \n\nJust say, \"Hey, when you are not able to talk, how can I support you?\"  Give some examples or suggestions if she does not know where to start, or ask if she wants a notebook (or that she can text you) when she cannot talk (if those work for her). \n\nI personally want to be left alone. I tend to go mute when I am in an autistic shutdown because everything was too much. So pressuring me or adding more stimulation to whatever situation is happening is the easiest way for me to go into meltdown and start yelling or harming myself to get out of the situation instead. (In my mind, a hospital trip is less stress and less overwhelming than whatever is happening at the moment, since no one understood how urgently I needed everything to stop.) I have SM and my partner and I are learning certain ASL signs so that I can communicate basic care needs when mute as a first step. Eventually we want to be fairly fluent but he is one handed which grows a wrench in his ability to do all the signs. Anyways it helps me communicate that I am ok, not mad at him, and what I need.\n\nRemember too that \u201cselective mutism\u201d does not mean we choose to be mute and insinuating such could be very hurtful to her and others with SM.\n\nYou should definitely be asking her these things on how you can help bc every person is different and we do not know her needs. This is really good info thank you so much! Thank you for the advice :)", "Need someone to talk with? I just wanted to say that if anyone is struggling with selective mutism and need someone to talk with, feel free to message me:)(I am new to reddit..  you can message people here, right?\ud83d\ude02). When I was a kid and teenager there was almost no information about selective mutism. My parents had to literally translate things from german to norwegian so that the school would have information about my diagnose. I remember how incredibly lonely it felt, especially when I realized that the other kids and even 99% of the adults had no idea what selective mutism was/is. \nSo if anyone ever needs to talk about it with someone who understands, I am here:) \n\nAnd also think of it this way: selective mutism is rare. We are special\ud83d\ude0e only between 0.03% and 1% of people have selective mutism. And also, for those who have instagram, check out the chargimals! They make small and cute monsters for different type if chronic/mental illnesses, I asked them last year at some point if they could make one for selective mutism and I think that they are releasing that one soon\ud83d\ude0d Are you Norwegian? Yes:) Jeg og:) Nice:) Hey Hey:) Same here! I joined this community to learn about SM in case someday I encounter someone with it. You can talk to me if you want to! Thanks, same goes for you! You can ask me anytime if you have any questions about SM:) Hey I am Swedish and there is like no info on selective mutism here, and if there is it is about children.\n\nI was just wondering, if you have \u2018overcome\u2019 selective mutism, how did you do it and how long did it take? I bought a lot of things that you had to get over the counter, so deli-meat things in the supermarkets, baked goods from the bakery etc. Things where I would have to talk in order to get it. In the beginning my mom would tell the people what we were doing and then ask if she could stand next to the person working there, so that I could talk to her, but the person working there would hear it too. In the beginning it was so quiet that only my mom could hear me because she knew what I was saying. It took a few years to get to a point where I was able to talk with strangers semi-normally (still did not talk like a \"normal\" person would, but people just thought I was super shy). And we did the buying things over the counter thing every day. Every fucking day. I hated it. I knew at the time and I still know that it was necessary, but I hated it. I cried a lot. I was angry and upset and depressed and just annoyed. Do not get me wrong tho, without all of that I would not be able to talk with people, but I just want to be honest about what it was like while it was happening. \n\nAs a reward, each time I managed to order something I could squirt one blob/drop of paint on a board at home. Originally I wanted to fill water balloons with paint and throw darts at them, like in the first princess diary movie. But we could not figure out how to get the paint into the balloons so I just held the bottle of paint and squeezed it\ud83d\ude02 I saved up until I could do several squirts/squeezes at once and did it in several colors. When I was all done with the training/therapy/excercises I drew the outline of a ghost on the board and my dad cut it out. That was/is my mutism ghost. Idk why but for whatever reason selective mutism was always referred to as a ghost\ud83d\ude02 I was also supposed to draw myself with my mutism ghost next to me as a kid and then keep doing it as time went on, to see if the ghost became smaller/I became bigger (I.e. me overcoming the anxiety) but I do not think I ever actually did more than one drawing in the beginning\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And yeah, I think most information is about children, since most people \"outgrow\" it at some point. I do not like saying that I have outgrown it or overcome it. I have overcome a lot of it, but it is definitely still there and I am 100% sure that a part of it will always be there. It might be small and not so noticeable, but it will always be there. I mean, all the people I did not talk with previously, all the kids from school, all the teachers and the family members.. I still cannot talk with them. But also, some of the family members I have no contact with anymore, the ones I have some contact with sometimes life 3-4 hours away and I see them maybe a couple of times a year.. if even that. And then the kids and teachers I have not seen since I left 10th grade. Well, I have seen one of them once. Awesome, this gives me a bit of hope! \ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcec\ud835\udcee \u261c(\uff9f\u30ee\uff9f\u261c)\n#Nice Leaderboard\n**1.** `u/RepliesNice` at **1644 nice's**\n\n**2.**

romanticize mental health disorders but i have to be real with myself.\n\n im a 15 year old male. ive always been a very very very very quiet kid. super quiet. literally that is the first thing people say when describing me. in every single report card since 2nd grade teachers would always write \"quiet\" \"doesnt speak much\" \"does not participate\" etc. in school i would not say a word all day and not even realize until someone pointed it out. although i am shy, that wasnt the only reason for my behavior, i just didnt feel that \"need\" to socialize and was more comfortable in my own thoughts. id feel embarrassed when someone would speak to me but id still reply. at home, i indeed did speak more. id make weird noises and say random things just because. i definitely didnt do things like that in school and id annoy my immediate family a lot, maybe i was making up for the little to none social interaction i had in school. that shouldve been a red flag but nothing was done. now regarding my experience in MIDDLE school, oh my god.\n\n im not even trying to boast or anything but i was in the top 3 quietest students. i for sure developed selective mutism. this was before i knew anything about mental health so i know its real and im not just \"faking\" it. if the teacher asked a question to the whole class, and picked me cause i never raised my hand, id just shrug and not say a word until she moved on to the next person. for general questions from my teachers and students, if it was a yes or no question, id just nod or shake my head. if it required me to speak, id shrug and look down until they left me alone. in group work, i would not say a word even if that meant i would get trouble. its not that i wanted to be rude and rebellious or anything, i just couldnt get the words out of my mouth for the life of me. sometimes i DID have something to say but there was just this lump in my throat that wouldnt allow me to say anything. id take the yelling, screaming, phone calls to my parents, rather than speaking. when we would do projects that we would have to present in front of the class, sometimes i wouldnt even do the project just to avoid presenting in front of the class. and if i did do it, i wouldnt stand up when it was my turn to present. the teacher would ask like ten times and i still wouldnt. the whole class would stare at me but at this point i was taking all embarrassment and punishments if that would mean i didnt have to speak, after begging me, the teacher would just send me to the school counselor. i was known as the \"quiet kid\" and \"the kid that doesnt do any work\". i knew this kid that i got along with and now i realize he probably had selective mutism too. he would get yelled at for not speaking by teachers and would cry in class, he would show signs of anxiety aswell and i could just tell he was going through the same thing i was so that is why i befriended him. again im not trying to brag but me and him were the only ones who were like this in the entire school. i knew something was wrong with me. eventually the school forced me to do therapy but that didnt work because you know.. selective mutism. then covid came i was so relieved. i did two years of school remotely and spoke to no one besides my mom, dad, and sister for a year and a half.\n\ni realize that im damaging myself and this couldve prevented by numerous ways by my school, parents, and myself but guess what i still have it. during mid-quarantine i thought my social anxiety was getting better as i havent felt the way i did in school for a while. i now realize that it hasnt and i havent felt that feeling of anxiety in a while because i never left the house or spoke to anyone besides people at my home. i am certain that i had it at one point but as of now im not sure because i dont encounter situations where i have to socialize with people i dont know very often. i still need my mom to speak for me in situations like ordering food or encountering other family members. i avoid family reunions and when im told to go the park to get some sunlight i just hide somewhere close to my home. i know im damaging myself but regardless i still have very very bad social anxiety. i havent had a friend in a few years. in a few weeks im going to go back to regular classes and im scared because my anxiety probably got 10 times worse. i also feel like i getting diagnosed just gives an excuse behavior for certain mental health issues, depression being the most common. some people just need that kick to start their engine. i know theyre different things regardless i feel like if i get diagnosed its just like \"yep u got problems, ur not capable and u can use this as an excuse for your failure\"\n\nso a few questions: \n\nis this selective mutism?\n\nwhat is the point of diagnosement? should i get diagnosed? and if so, how?\n\nis it wrong for me to claim i have selective mutism even if i have not been diagnosed? I have felt almost all of the things you described, it really sucks and I am sorry no one helped you. \n\nIt really sounds like selective mutism and you should try getting a diagnosis from a professional. \nI would not worry too much about thinking of it as an excuse as long as you are not using it to purposely not talk. Knowing you have selective mutism can help put you on track to treating it, which makes it not an excuse. And about your claiming question, I think it would be fine to tell others you have sm. Even if somehow this is not a case of sm, it will still help others understand why you act the way you do. \n\nSorry if this comment is unhelpful or jumbled up, commenting gives me anxiety, so I struggle to write what I am thinking. But I really hope you find the help you need. Theres like a 99.9% chance you have SM from what I read. I am writing a massive comment for you which answers the questions and more so please stand by. hopefully i finish by today thank you! alright and yeah i literally found out what SM was today and its almost like it was describing me specifically \r  \nYour life is very similar to mine, and I have been diagnosed.\r  \nThe main point of a diagnosis is to get accommodations from teachers so you can get the learning experience you deserve. It also prevents adults from saying you have some other condition, which is also important.\r  \nTry writing a letter to your school counselor telling them to recommend you to a therapist. Since you would probably be more comfortable with it, ask to see the therapist online.\r  \nThen write to the therapist about these experiences and they should tell you have SM.\r  \nIt is not wrong to tell ppl about SM without an official diagnosis, but the problem is... no one's going to believe you. Especially if they have no idea what it is. They are probably just going to tell you you have something else that you know you do not have.\r  \n\r  \ngeneral tips: \r  \nThis is a very under-researched condition, so not many people, probably not even the adults at your school, have heard of it.\r  \nThe MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR at my school did not know what it was when I told her about it, and so she tried to tell me I am faking it and that I do not have it. \r2 weeks later a therapist told me I had it for sure. I told the counselor about this and what do you know, she went reeeeeal quiet.\r  \n\r  \nNot even the internet always gives an accurate definition of what SM is, so be careful what you believe online, and especially be careful about what other people without SM tell you about how they think is the way you should cure SM.\r  \nAlso, there is a small chance the therapist you get will not know what SM is.\r  \n\r  \nMy theories about SM and how I think it can be cured: \n\nI believe the main *irrational* fear that this condition entails is a fear of judgement.\r  \nIt is extremely important, especially since you mentioned depression, that you start trying to cure the condition as soon as possible.\n\n\r  \nThe way to combat this fear is not to repel it, but to sit with it. Basically do not hide from any feelings of anxiety you may feel.\r  \nAll you are allowed to do is breathe heavily, but do not step back form the fear in any way or you will not get your results.\r  \nObviously this is hard as shit, but I have sort of followed these tips before and seen improvements.\r  \n\r  \nI would **HIGHLY** recommend you go to school to try this.\n\nSM does get a bit worse during quarantine. I guess its cause we are not working against the fear as much, but its not unusual.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe main thing you should know is that you should not regret or be embarrassed about ANYTHING you have done, any way you have acted, or anything you will do. And I mean ANYTHING.\r  \nBecause everyone is done all the embarrassing shit, its just that they were younger when they did it. And if you do something embarrassing that you think no one else has done, you can bet your ass I have either done it or would have done it :)\r  \n\r  \nSocially, you might later on find yourself being annoyed at the fact that you cannot fit in with the normal kids.\r  \nAnd to that, what I have to say is: Do not try to be them. Understand that your life has been completely different from theirs, so you cannot expect yourself to be similar to them. But you can still be friends with them.\r  \n\r  \nOne last thing: I have hopefully given you a lot of information on how to cure SM, but know this, and this was the most recent thing I have learned and therefore the hardest:\r  \nYou cannot really \"claim\" or internalize anything you have realized until you get rid of the fear.\r  \nFor example: In my head, I understand that I should not give af what people have to say about me, but I know I will not act that way until my irrational fear of judgement is gone completely.\r  \n\r  \nP.S. Excuse me if I repeat myself at parts or if some things do not connect, I wrote a bunch of my thoughts and then organized it.\r  \nI will probably make a edited version of this comment as a full on post, one day. thank you for taking your time to write this! about adults saying i have some other condition, i think this is actually happening at this moment. i still have forced therapy and they believe i have adhd.. they gave me amphetamine and everything. i seriously doubt I have adhd as im not very energetic and displayed no signs in my early childhood. although i do show some of the symptoms, i think the average neurotypical can experience the same thing. i dont say much to my therapist but ill definitely bring this up in the next meeting This is great advice, some of which I havent even heard on this sub yet. Imma try this, too \\&gt;id make weird noises and say random things just because. \n\nI do not think I have SM, but I do this too yeah lots of people do, i added that in just to show how comfortable i was at home to speak vs other places Hi, to me this sounds a lot like selective mutism. Having this myself I really feel for what you are going through. I was diagnosed when I was 3 im now 14 and Im pretty sure you can get diagnosed if you get your mum or dad to go to the doctors about it.  I really dont think its wrong to claim you have selective mutism because you basically have all the symptoms so you have every right to be concerned about this. If I were you Id go talk with your mum or dad or someone you feel very close too because I think you should get diagnosed.\n\nGetting diagnosed can get you therapy sessions and a better understanding for your teachers and class mates.\n\nIf your in the uk you can get councilling for free by applying through a doctor.\n\nAny other countries im sure that you can get therapy for free through NHS or better help.\n\nChat lines like young minds, teen line and many others if you type crisis lines on google.\n\nId like to say your really really brave! Its hard but I believe youll find the help needed! &lt;3 thank you ur so kind &lt;33 ME.LITETALLY ME. I live in  country where mental health is not recognized at all and when people think mental health they think \"crazy\" people who often times re not given the proper treatment. So I am basically mocked, pitied or ignored by everyone. I am sorry this happened to you and I want you to know that there is someone out there who feels the same way we are all struggling together and we have to be strong for each other. I think you should go seek a therapist it could greatly effect you later on in life. Rock on stranger.(sorry for grammar mistakes and the downright cringey line at the end lol)", "Is anyone else unable to speak to their family? I (17M) can only speak to a few friends that I see at college and that is it, no parents, siblings or teachers. I just want to know if anyone else is in the same position or if anyone has overcome it. i am recovered (F18) and can speak to everyone in my life more or less fine, but when it comes to explaining intimate/emotional stuff with my family i physically cant do it lol. if i try to verbalise, i just start crying and i never get to say what i wanted to. whenever this happens, it gives me flashbacks of when i used to have SM where this would happen in all situations. SM most commonly presents as being unable to speak in public/social situations such as school, work, parties, family gatherings, etc, and being able to speak at home with family. Although it seems to be more rare, there are some people with SM who are the opposite. So they can speak freely at school, work, parties, family gatherings, but find themselves unable to speak at home. There is also progressive mutism, where SMers are unable to speak to any person in any situation, including at home with family. My point is, although it does sometimes feel like it, you definitely are not alone. I can only speak to a handful of friends, and only alone at college, sometimes i cannot even say everything I want to around them. I used to also be able to talk comfortably around my family but now I am just silent around them, simply going downstairs to have dinner with them scares me. Maybe early signs of progressive mutism idk, hope not. Thanks for your reply tho:)) I talk to most people now but never my dad (except being overheard on accident) since I was four. I feel guilty as hell Yeh I can never explain my emotions.. or just anything lol, but hopefully I recover like you and everything will become a little easier:)) i have faith in you that you will recover ! just give it time and patience \ud83d\udc95 It really sucks, especially the guilt (for me at least). Hopefully everything will improve though I am the same way now. I can no longer eat in front of my family, and I have slowly said less and less to them. I think I am headed down the path of progressive mutism as well. Let us just wish neither of us go down that road I defiantly was not able to talk to my parents at times growing up. The emotional stuff being the hardest. So yes I feel you.\n\nI still have not completely overcome it, but I started by saying smaller things. It gives me a lot of anxiety to talk to them still. I had to start somewhere. It really has gotten a lot better and I am getting closer towards overcoming it. \n\nGood luck :) Usually people feel most comfortable with their family at home. But there are also people who feel far safer and less anxious with their small coterie of chosen family than they do with their blood family. I am one. I am writing a book with a character who has SM and cannot speak to his family - he is also around your age. While I do not have SM now (might have as a child, but am no longer completely sure for messed up reasons related to abuse that I do not want to get into), I feel like I understand how he ended up that way COMPLETELY. It is weird. I often put myself in his shoes and know it is how I would have reacted - or rather been unable to react, I suppose - in that situation, if that makes sense.  \nSo as so many lovely others have said here, I do not think you are alone at all, even if it feels like it! You are so strong - keep fighting the good fight! I am a child and adult psychiatrist. Cognitive Behavior Therapy combined with SSRI medication can be effective treatment for SM of any kind. Most universities have mental health services available for students. Perhaps you could research these online and inquire about them via e-mail? I had depression not SM in college but it was around avoidance of uncomfortable emotions and therapy is what finally helped me deal with it. I also took antidepressants briefly as another poster mentioned.\n\nHow do you feel when you are around your family? Do you feel comfortable with them? It is the same with me, except with friends at college (well maybe cause I do not have any friends I am not sure) I can only speak with online friends like over a mic on gaming, or in a discord call with close friends. But no parents, or people at school", "Does anyone use speech cards? Tips? Im looking to make speech cards so im less vulnerable when mute. Any ideas for phrases/words? How to keep them? Where to carry them? How to contruct them? Any other tips/ experiences welcome \n\nTheres lots of ideas in this album, and if youre looking to communicate via text i find that some AAC apps can be helpful to people. I personally do not, but one phrase I would definetely write down is, \"could you please repeat what you said? I did not hear you\".\n\nThis happens to me waaaaaay too often. I often miss what people say and it leads to a very awkward situation. I do not display emotions very well on my face so I cannot look confused. It is embarrasing when someone tells me to do something and I am just standing there doing nothing because I have no idea what they said. Same with a \"yes or no\" question I could have easily nodded or shook my head too.\n\nHowever, speech cards are limited. There are too many phrases and so many situations that require certain responses. Personally, I would use a whiteboard than speech cards. There are many whiteboards available that are quite small, and it is less of a hastle to simply write down your response than take out your stack of cards, flip through them all, etc. And sometimes you may come across a question that your speech cards do not answer. \n\nOr, a better idea could be to use both! You can have speech cards that (for example), explain your situation/inability to communicate at that moment, as it would be rather tiresome to write it all down. Similarly, if a person asks for example, \"what is your favourite color?\" you will not have a speech card for that but you can take out your whiteboard and write it down.\n\nIf you are not comfortable with carrying a whiteboard or pre-organized speech cards, you can just have a folded piece of paper in your pocket or something and write down stuff on the spot. For example, in class when I need to ask a friend something I just quickly scribble it down in my notebook or a paper and hand it to them. Also you can use your phone and type out answers, that works too. i used to have a deck that my therapist and i made but i recently switched to a small white board. its SO much easier and i highly recommend it These are so neat! I wish my parents or therapist had known about these cards when I was a kid I actually have an app on my phone called I Can Communicate and it has cards that you can make and press and then phone will speak and stuff. It is been really helpful A card which says something like \"Can you repeat that? I did not catch what you said\" would be a big pog. Admittedly I am listening to too much Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and Linkin Park which as a result has definitely made my hearing far worse than what it once was so I find myself in these situations a ton.\n\nSince I mentioned Linkin Park I should also say RIP to my dude Chester Bennington. A bright soul like him should not have left so soon, nonetheless having him be the one choosing to leave.", "Question about medication Hi All,\n\nMy 7 year old daughter diagnosed as SM is showing some good progress from last few weeks after school agreed to start fade in sessions. She now can speak to one teacher at school irrespective of where she is and who is around her. But, she still has lots of challenges with respect to initiating conversation. \n\nShe generally speak to her peers. But, initiating conversation is something which she cannot do. She is fine if other kids ask her if she wants to play with them. But, she is not ready to do ask them first.\n\nApart from that, we are also finding it challenging to engage her in sports and other activities. She shows initial interest but loses it within first few sessions as it becomes difficult for her to follow instructions and she gives up and shows complete lack of interest.\n\nWith all these going on I am thinking about requesting medication for her in our upcoming appointment with paediatrician. I have not been so much in favour of medication, But, since it is kind of inhibiting her in many ways, I am starting to think about this.\n\nI want to know following from you:\n\n1. If you are a parent of kid who is under medication, at what age did you start medicating your kid and how many years you waited to see if it can be solved via therapy.\n\n2. Do you regret your decision to medicate or not medicate your kid at certain point of time or do you regret not medicating earlier?\n\n3. If you are SM and have attempted medication path, happy to learn your experience in this path.\n\nI have been reading about side effects and other risks associated with this. Hence, I am fairly prepared to take this chance if paediatrician agrees with us. Please help me with info and suggestions if you can. You should probably ask the pediatrician about it. If she does not/has not changed for a while, then you could try it. It is better to try and stop than not at all. My parents were against medication even after therapy failed and I have not been able to make any progress without being told I now need medication after a 6 year deficit of help. Our daughter is 5 and started low dose Prozac about 2 months ago. It was not an easy decision and i did not like the idea of medicating my 5 year old with an anti depressant. When I talked to our doctor, he could see that I was hesitant, but he told us that medication may be just a stepping stone for her to build up the confidence for talking. That, and we had done everything else we could have up to that point: play therapy, seeing a psychologist, workshops, etc with no progress. \nI could not be happier with the decision to start her on Prozac. Within a month we saw a big improvement. She is still not talking  but she is making huge steps and it is helped her so much with confidence and self doubt without changing her personality at all. She is changing. But, it is a very slow process. And there is still long way to go. And there is no improvements with respect to non speaking aspects. Even initiating non verbal communication is hard for her.\n\nMy wife at present is very much against medication. I am trying to persuade her to have open mind till we speak to pediatrician.\n\nI feel for your parents. They may be regretting the decision not to start the medication earlier. This is exactly what I want to avoid. Thanks very much for sharing this. I can only speak from my personal experience, I got diagnosed at about 4. Never got medicated and got over it. My Progress was slow and steady, therapy helped me a lot. I do not know much about the medication but I am glad that I overcame it without. But definitely speak with your doctors and paedicatricians. And sleep a bit over this I am also against medication, but I do not know why.\n\nSo far I have declined everything so far because I do not want to get \"better\". I believe that the structure of society is not for me and would like to spend as little time on it as I can.\n\nBetter is in quotes because I feel like the enjoyment in life is false and made up. People who believe it are chasing a facade but theyre stuck in a cycle and are too ignorant to realise. Agree if medication is required for lifelong. From what I have heard, it may just be required to break the pattern. I heard stories about people coming out of it within year and all.\n\nIt is also my understanding that more we delay less effective medication will be. Hence, starting medication at later may mean higher dosage and longer dependency.\n\nI might be wrong. I was put on zoloft around age 13 and lexapro after the zoloft failed. I am doubtful that either of them helped. I recovered through exposure therapy and CBT in a residential treatment program at age 15. It is hard for me to say whether or not the lexapro played a role in my treatment. I have discontinued it since and am now taking meds that are more effective for my anxiety.\n\nTaking medication does not educate you on how to deal with anxiety and selective mutism. In other words, it cannot serve as a replacement for CBT and exposure therapy. Based on my personal experience with SM and medication, I would say that meds are most helpful when used in addiction to effective therapy.\n\nI cannot advise you on what age it is appropriate to start a child on medication. I would encourage you to discuss this with the pediatrician and think carefully about it before making a decision. Hope all goes well. Agree that meds alone will not work. We are doing whatever we can from our side. We are thinking about meds only to speed up the process and make it easy for her. I have had selective mutism for as long as I can remember. But due to an abusive situation. My medical history is a bit messy. Sorry for lack of detail.\n\nPersonally I do not like medicating. I suggest trying medication. And communicating with your child how they feel about it.\n\nIf they do not like it. Feel free to try something alternative but you need to accept at a certain point that maybe medicating is not the route. I remember when I was forced on medication. Did it help with anything? Not one bit. My parent and social worker, never bothered to take me to therapy. They just pulled out the meds and hoped for me to just magically start talking to everybody without any problems.\n\nIts basiclally similar to depression. You know, just because somebody shoves anti depressive medication down their throat, does not mean the depression just stops.", "Trying to get over my SM I am 16 and I have fit the description of selective mutism my whole life but when I was 13 I really wanted to start doing something about it. I am about to graduate which means I would have went through 12 years of school without speaking to my peers once. I do not want that. But something I want even less is to leave without ever having a single friend in my whole life. I was talking to a guy my age who lives abroad, I told him about my situation and he asked me \u2018so there is no one you even text on a daily, weekly basis?\u2019 and my loneliness hit me so hard. Everyone has someone they talk to. I know a person I can only describe as \u2018very damaged\u2019 and she still has a few people she talks to. I talk to absolutely no one. Anything I feel has to stay inside me and it melts my fucking soul im so miserable. Everyone thinks I am weird because I never talk but i have so much in common with the people around me it is so painful to watch potential connections fly by. \n\nFor the past three years I have been planning to \u2018come out\u2019 by just responding to someone when they expect me not to. The first week I had this idea I actually did it. I really cared about this person because they were one of the first and only people to pay any attention to me in my new school, I knew her for over a year at that point but I guess she did not know how much doing that meant to me. I understand it is something everyone is supposed to be able to do but it was actually a huge achievement. Now there are more people around me who know how my condition is and if I said a single word to them they would flip but these days I just cannot find the courage. I imagine it like this: we are alone somewhere (critical condition !!! Three\u2019s a crowd) they say hey, I say hey back and I sit there feeling good for making someone feel like the kid who looks like he hates everyone actually likes them. I do not have any single target, I have a few but they are all girls so that looks weird but I swear to God all the boys around me are extremely hypermasculine tryhards who cannot hold a deep conversation. The goal of doing this is not to immediately start talking to everyone, I just want to have one person to talk to and if I end up talking to other people then that is a plus.  It sounds like you are describing me.. I feel you OP. 22 year old female. I didnt talk to anyone except my dad and sister for 15 years of my life after dealing with a traumatic experience as a child. I verbally talked to my grandma at 18 and my aunt and uncle and cousins at age 22, just 6 months ago. I moved away from my hometown once I was able to to start fresh. I WANTED to talk to people, but in high school, that is who I was. A school of 500 people new me as the girl who didnt talk. So when I went to college I left that life behind me and verbally spoke to everyone. Of course when I go back home I am still the girl who doesnt talk if I see friends out and about... but I try to avoid being in that situation if at all possible. That was the best thing I ever did for myself. I am now 22, living 2 hours away where no one knows me, working in a corporate office and everyone knows me as a normal person. It is so freeing... the first step is really wanting to. Personally, talking to people I know is absolutely the hardest (hence why it took so long to talk to even my own family)... I believe that you can do it. Baby steps. Hi,\nI am a 20 year old guy (not the macho type). You are story, sounded as if I wrote it myself! I fit the description for selective mutism in middle school, where from the end of 6th grade to until I eventually left (beginning of 8th), I did not talk at all. \n\nBut just a little history of myself. I have always been quiet and shy. I recently found a pre-k report that said I am attentive, but too quiet and does not really talk to anyone. But I never had problems (that interfered with school) until middle school, where I do not why, but I just shut down. \n\nAnyway, those years I was in middle school, I was completely miserable. Each day I dreaded entering the building to the after-school program I was in. But extra dreadful before classes started. Be it from people begging me to \"just talk!\" to people making these outrageous diagnoses about what could be \"wrong\" with me ('maybe he has Tourette syndrome!' someone said once), I just hated it. My mom eventually brought me to a therapist, but after a couple sessions (before he was able to give an official diagnosis), I promised my mom I would talk (I thought seeing a therapist meant I was crazy at the time, so I protested like I never did before) and she said okay. \n\nIn reality, I had actually made plans to get myself removed from the school. I had already been on academic probation, so a few more missed assignments meant that was it. And so it was. My plan was to just \"start new\" at a different middle school. Like you, I hated the reaction I may have got when I talked--\"omg, he talked!\" But the first time someone asked me \"what is your name?\" at my new middle school, I did not hesitate to answer. I made a vow not only to my mom, but to myself, that what I experienced at the previous middle school, I would not experience here. \n\nIt took time, but I began from there to become more social, though many people still perceived me as unusually quiet. I took long strides from there to high school, where I was still \"the quiet guy in the room\". In high school, towards graduation, the realization that I had not had any friends and that I was lonely began to set in. I was the guy in the room who did not speak to anyone unless spoken to, which made me stand out, and I hated to stand out.\n\nIt is kind of ironic, because while I hated to stand out, I usually put myself out there unintentionally (by being the \"chill\" and down to earth guy; having a walk that people saw as cool and smooth; but most of all, sitting alone at the assemblies we would have\ud83d\ude25). The loneliness began to envelope me, though. I began to brood about how I have no friends, never had friends--or at least a friend who was thoughtful and close to me-- or never will have one. \n What I have discovered: you can get over the most extreme forms of SM, if you would only hear your own voice more often. I definitely recommend singing in the shower (if no one can hear you) or visiting a forest by yourself and just yelling at the trees. You have to get used to hearing your voice and knowing that this does not have any negative effects. You might get a rush at first, an adrenaline shot, hearing yourself and knowing nobody was going to hurt you for it.", "Disorder in the mind I have seen posts over the years of different people asking questions finding guidance and help here on reddit, very unsure how to feel asking but this area community might have some guidance that can help my family.\n\nNow nearly 7 months my elder brother has completely stopped speaking to all members of our family.  He does not leave the room he is staying in unless to clear his system and at times when forced to get up and take a shower.  His only form of interaction is through gestures to signature a desire to eat when signaling my father who is trying to support him, my mother who visits him just sits there trying connect with him in the state he is in.  He barely watches any television unless turned on for him by my father who must then leave and go to work.  Aunts and uncles have tired to communicate with him but to no avail.  He has both me and our sister but she and her husband are also a trigger for him where he becomes agitated he has not acted out any physical confrontation but rather just the mere mention of either of their names will send him into a state where he blockades the bedroom door or locks himself on the bathroom for extended periods of time.  I am aware he previously took medication to help with depression, attended therapy with a licensed physician.  This case I could not compare to most of the readings I was finding with selective mutism since it was in childhood that it was seen or noticed I was not apart of that time line but from stories and photographs it did not appear that he was suffering from anything that was left undiscovered at the time.  He was very active from what I vaguely recall from my earliest memories of him but I was around 4-5 while he was 15-16.  He is 35 now underwent therapy at 33 which seemed to help during that first year but he did shows signs of being emotionally distant, yet I ignored it and focused on my own personal agenda.  I truly want to find the right steps to guide my family in hopes of helping him while he cannot help himself both my parents are getting up in their years, I can not financially support him if they are gone and he is still found to be in this state.  He refuses to leave the room to attend sessions with physicians, I see as a sign of not wanting to help himself and refuses medication prescribed for him.  This is my way of asking the right questions, asking for help, and somewhere that did not realize I needed to vent. That is a lot to process there. I do not get much of the picture though. Has he been diagnosed with anything? You are saying 7 months ago he spoke to family? What about strangers and such? No interaction with strangers or friends he only keeps himself shut in a bedroom.  Previous therapist that was treating him for depression is not able to offer assistance unless he willingly leaves the home to seek treatment.  Enters a silent tantrum now flailing arms and clenches his head as if he was being blasted with large speakers when approached over the subject.", "For people with SM, do you also have social anxiety disorder? Just curious hehe... (\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\n\n( My son does and also has high functioning autism. i certainly do. especially crowds though, makes a lot of physical anxiety Yes, also autism.\n\nAlso my SM is tied directly to my anxiety/depression/CPTSD and im currently going through maybe the worst episode of it i have had since i was a teenager (which is the last time i can remember my social anxiety being this high- not a coincidence)", "never got better..? i thought i was getting better. but now i think i have just been avoiding things that make me anxious that it was all just an illusion of me becoming better when i never really did. How old are you? I am 23! I am sorry you are going through this. My daughter is 14 and going through it as well. We have not known for very long that she even has it. I am sorry you are going through this. My daughter is 14 and going through it as well. We have not known for very long that she even has it. thank you, i guess I am just at a stressful part of my life right now. \nAt least you know now, she will need a lot of support from her family :) I mean, sometimes anxiety is not going to go away and the best you can do is just avoid circumstances that cause it to the best of your ability. You definitely should not feel guilty for continuing to have that anxiety, if it were easy to get rid of no one would have it. Well I think avoiding things that make you anxious is something that you can use for your benefit, even if it might look like taking a step back in recovery, for some it might help.  \nhaving less anxiety in your daily life might open some windows for you to talk comfortably with people you feel safe with, and with time might help you build yourself for more energy consuming encounters with people.  \nPersonally I do not support forcing on myself any situations that I know would just make me feel anxious and nervous, but sometimes when I really have to do something I can kind of push through... \n\nsmall steps saaaame, mate. what are you avoiding now? right! I have just been avoiding social events for college unless they are necessary, and not hanging out with friends a lot.. not that I have a lot of friends anyway but I get so mentally tired from one hang out that the next hang out may be weeks later.. School and my part time job are already super draining for me 100% relate to college being draining lol. right now I have a public speaking class, but I want nothing more than to drop it before we have even given the first speech. I do not have any friends, but it is probably by choice in a way. The making-new-friends stage is the hardest part, so I avoid that even though I would love to hang out with someone...maybe once a month. omg hate that for you! My university requires public speaking class and I thought \u201chmm maybe I can challenge myself with an online class\u201d so I go in my first day in person and the professor of course asks all of us to introduce ourselves one by one.. luckily I somehow was not picked because there were so many students.. but I cried anyway.. but then luckily again my college offered online public speaking class and it just required for me to video myself speaking to \u201cthe audience\u201d who were just my family members. Maybe look into if your college offers it online?\n\nI agree! I want friends but do not want friends at the same time ahah, I have just been telling myself that I did not come to college to make friends, just here to accept a piece of expensive paper! I believe they do have an online one, but for some reason, I also have a huge dislike/fear of being recorded, along with hearing my own voice played back. D:\n\nI guess eventually I will suck it up and do that though, because in-person is not happening lol...I think the only way I could do is if I asked my doctor for drugs or something.\n\nwe had to do introductions in all three of my classes this semester...it was dreadful haha. and now my math teacher keeps making me talk every day. I have that too! But I just prefer doing that over me having to speak in front of what feels like a million people. \n\nYou got this!! I used to take Prozac which I am really not sure if it worked for me or not; but I was told by someone I know who has social anxiety about a medication called Propranolol which is a more modern medicine and has no side effects! I personally have not tried it since I do not go to the doctors anymore but maybe that is something you could ask/suggest your doctor?\n\nUgh I feel you, it is such a waste of time too lmao\nSomehow I was able to do a quick introduction when it was not exactly in front of people but just when we had to stand up in place and one person spoke after the other and whatnot. Thank you! I have never been on medication before. It feels pretty ironic that the idea of going on anti-anxiety medication causes me extreme anxiety lmao. \n\nI have heard of propranolol and other beta bockers being used for public speaking. actually I am super curious if that would help because iirc they work by stopping only physical symptoms like racing heart. so like..I wonder if I would be completely internally freaking out or if the physical aspects impact your mental state too. idk\n\nmy doctor did offer me Zoloft once, but of course I immediately fixate on negative side effects and jump down the Google rabbit hole of SSRI horror stories. I am so good at getting in my own way of trying to improve things and be happy aha\n\nwe are supposed to give the first speech on Tuesday tho, so there is not enough time to get anything (...except the CBD I have ;). Dropping the class sounds *so* relieving but there is that avoidant mentality that makes me feel like a coward again.\n\nFor a brief time, I was a graphic design major and successfully gave presentations, but that was because the classes were tiny and everyone was looking at the projector screen, not me. omg ahah that is so true! I think it would be worth trying though! \n\nThat is really interesting, yeah I feel like in our situation it is really more mental than it is physical panicking? So it would make more sense to have something to help ease our mental state haha\n\nyeah I remember when I took prozac it would usually always make me sleepy and tired and moody all the time :/\n\noh man I am getting anxious for you lol, you can do it!\nI was actually looking into CBD products! What do you use/where do you get it? Unless we are talking about  different things.. ahaha\nI mean if it is not too late to withdraw class without it affecting your GPA or tuition then I would totally switch to online! You would not be avoiding it if you still take the public speaking class ;) I think that is already really brave of you. \n\nomg whaaat. I am actually an art major focusing in graphic design right now! I could never give presentations, it is so crazy how even within the SM community people are affected by it/act differently! yeah, I feel like it is more mental for me, although I do get a few physical symptoms. sometimes I wish there was more research and awareness around SM. I have had psych textbooks that do not even mention it. Hardly anyone knows about it, so that can result in a lot of misunderstandings with people. and I still wonder why I have it.\n\nCBD kind of works for me. It can have a nice anxiolytic effect, but it sometimes seems inconsistent. and I do not have enough money to buy big doses. The brands I tried were NuLeaf and Lazarus Naturals (I bought online), which have drops that you put under your tongue. I think it is overall worth a shot tho.\n\nI also uhh, smoked CBD a few times, but that was mostly to do something that felt bad\u2122 for fun lol. I had never smoked before that.\n\nso cool that you are an art major! how are you liking graphic design? I have done it as a hobby for years. I switched majors because...basically I decided I would rather keep it a hobby than make it a career, or just freelance here and there.\n\nthe speech would be like 12 hours from now. I thiiink I am going to drop it and do it online another time. the stress for 12 more weeks might be too much. but in exchange, I am going to try to challenge myself in other ways this semester! Yeah I agree, my physical symptoms are like getting tense af, feeling like I am getting choked, stuff like that. Oh yeah I am so glad somehow my parents knew a friend of theirs who brought up SM and I was able to be diagnosed when I was in primary school! Who knows what would have happened if that did not happen.. I do not know why I have it either, I have heard it could be genetics, childhood trauma, etc.. but other than my mom being shy as a kid, I cannot really point a finger to why I have it. \n\nOhh I might have to try them out! I am not trying to buy any in big doses until I know it works anyway. \n\nOmg same, the one and only time I got up in the clouds was not necessarily relaxing but like you said, it was more just for fun ahaha \n\nI am really liking it! My professor has been telling me how I have so much potential and he actually let me skip from Graphic Design 2 to GD4 since it is the only one offered this semester and I will be graduating after! It is actually funny, he told me in front of the other classmates how me not talking in class could be a positive thing because I am so focused on my work while others talk to each other and that made me tear up a bit! Because all these years, me not speaking has always been a \u201cproblem\u201d and basically a negative thing and he took it in a positive way :\u2019)  \nI think keeping it a hobby is a good idea too, I do not necessarily know what I am trying to do after I graduate tbh. What is your major now?\n\nOhh that is good! I am sure you are doing the right thing! I do not think we need to push ourselves too much, personally it would probably make me feel worse when I end up not being able to do anything :\\ yeah I tend to get really shallow breathing and sometimes racing heart, or I will feel a bit sick with nerves, shaky, or tired. I think I was diagnosed at age 4 because I stopped talking to my dad. my mom is also a bit quiet, but more functionally so.\n\n I only got a little treatment in early childhood, but I did not talk to the psychologist...so we stopped going. I did not really understand SM myself until I started researching it on my own. I guess my parents just thought I would grow out of it because they never talked about it with me.\n\nthat is nice about the graphic design class! and congrats on almost graduating! I can see how that is true about focusing on work instead of chatting. there are maybe a few odd benefits to SM. \n\nright now I am just taking general education credits and still trying to explore and decide what I want to do with my life bc I have no idea. I like psychology and philosophy, but maybe that is just because I am trying to figure myself out. I am not sure what I like that is actually practical haha. oh yeah, getting so tense makes me so tired afterwards :( I see, I think my parents started to research because my teacher told them I would not talk to them or anyone in my class and would play alone. \n\nSame, I went to multiple different psychiatrists/ psychologists and I would not talk to any of them. I had one really horrible one where he would almost force me to talk and make me cry every time I went to see him. I have had so many different people treat me and I feel like that did not help too much because they would have to get to know me from the beginning again :\\\n\nThank u so much! I am super nervous but excited about graduating ahaha\nYeah I think I have read somewhere how people with SM have above-average intelligence too ;)\n\nThat is cool! I basically just went straight into art because I felt that was all I was really good at haha. I do like math too, so I feel like that also helps with graphic design a little bit\nI think it would be cool if you were to get into psychology, I feel like people like us who have mental \"disorders\" would be able to empathize with clients more? You could even do your senior thesis paper on SM and spread awareness! oh, that is unfortunate about the psychologist. I have definitely had people who tried to force me to speak, and as a child, I would just burst into tears.\n\nIn primary/grade school, I was super lucky to find two super close friends who I could whisper to and eventually speak at full volume around. I feel like at that age, kids were just curious and wanted to hear me, but when I got a bit older classmates seemed more judgmental. :/\n\nthat is very interesting about the intelligence! I feel like I am just in my own head and overthinking more than most people, which is good and bad.\n\nArt is amazing...I always said I wanted to be an artist when I was a kid. I have not really drawn in a long time, but I make graphics for fun a lot. That is a great point about psychology too! I might almost have trouble with empathizing too much and worrying about clients outside of work. It would be interesting to work with people with SM. I have never met anyone else with it irl though. ugh yeah they are the worst! I do not understand how someone can be a psychologist if they do not have empathy lol\n\nOhh that is awesome! I have had close friends like that too, it was great how they understood what we were going through or at least did not care if we talked or not I guess. Yeah I think at my age people would be weirded out by an adult who does not speak and assume I am either rude or just mute or do not speak English\n\noh yeah I overthink a whole bunch which I agree it is definitely good and bad ahaha\n\nThat is really cool! I have always drawn since I was little too :) I want to start drawing more too, I have been too busy with school projects that I do not have time/ do not feel motivated for it :\\\n\nOh true, you do not want to worry about clients too much outside of work and end up causing your stress either! But I think it is better than having 0 empathy  :) I am sure you would find a way to separate work life from personal life sooner or later too. \nI have never met anyone with SM irl either, I just always wonder how we would all react given that we all.. you know, do not talk much lmao. It would definitely be really cool to meet people with SM though! oh yeah, I feel bad when people mistake it as rudeness. like it is just a misunderstanding and I have not really done anything wrong, but I hate to make people feel like I do not want to talk to them. I usually wish I could, but then it is difficult to explain.\n\nI have wondered if talking to some kind of professional would help now because I know it would cause me a lot of stress, at least at first.\n\nsame about the drawing...I would love to do a lot of things more, but school, work, and sleep take up a lot of time of life lol\n\nIt would definitely be neat to meet someone who could totally understand and empathize! maybe it would be easier to talk to each other, but either way that conversation (or lack thereof lol) would be interesting. Yeah, like I try smiling and everything but when I am not, I look mean I guess, because of my rbf lmao and being tense does not help with that either\n\nI am not sure, the last time I went was maybe 2 years ago when I tried to get accommodations from the university but obviously would need to \u201ctalk\u201d to a school psychologist. I went once after we made an appointment and I was absolutely not into it. It was just the having to go though the same crap over again for like the 100th time  and somehow even though I had filled out information about myself the psychologist did not know I had SM and I could not explain what I had because I had SM so I am like ???!? D\u2019: so yeah, they made the next appointment but I never went back since haha\nI feel like in a way I am traumatized by psychologists just because I had to go through multiple of them and it is better for me to have a friend whom I would not have to \u201cgo through multiple of\u201d\n\noh yeah, we need sleep for sure! Usually when I draw, I like to draw realistically and/or go on like a drawing spree so I always have the need to be mentally ready to do that. \n\nabsolutely! I wonder if anyone w/ SM has met up before and how they reacted? I am sure it would be different from if two recovered SM people talk about their past struggles vs two SM people who are still going through it vs one of the each met up", "Voice physically cutting off? Hello everyone. I believe I have had some degree of SM all of my life, though I had never heard of it before reddit. I am mostly able to function in  social situations now, as I have pushed myself all my life to be more vocal. I still have trouble speaking my ideas clearly at times, but I try. One thing that happens to me when I am in a stressful situation is that I will start to talk, then suddenly my voice will physically cut off for a moment. I usually just pause and breathe, then try to continue, and my voice will return. Can anyone else with SM relate?", "Today I learned that I have selective mutism when I was a kid I saw a documentary about kids with selective mutism. And I was thinking I could relate to them, because I experienced that too when I was a kid. \n\nWhen I am with my mom and siblings, I am very talkative and mischievous.  But in school, other people and with my dad, I am really quiet. My dad works abroad, and go home once a year.  He is home for almost 2 months.  So I am not really comfortable with my dad around.\n\nIn school my classmates always taunts me and calls me 'mute'. They ask me why do not I speak. This made me really anxious all the time. Everyday I made an effort to talk in school, but my voice is not too loud for them to hear.  Others kids can be mean sometimes and I was not happy in school. \n\nI have been struggling with this until high school. I have been anxious all my life. While growing up I have been learning to manage my anxieties and fears and go on with my life. Which documentary This one ( I got diagnosed with sm at 19 because it went undiagnosed for so long. It is hard but with therapy it does get a lot better in my experience \ud83e\udd70 I did not find this out until recently. I struggled with it until I was in my early 20s, probably yeah I didnt really figure out I had an until the end of it. I was never diagnosed or anything but I mean it is easy to tell you do. But since I did not realize something like this existed until what I would consider the end of having it, it did not really help knowing lol. it did just give me a sense of relief and that I felt valid knowing others have gone through the same experience. kind of a bit of closure but I still do have an ongoing thing with anxiety lol I remember reading an article in the Wall Street journal about selective mutism, running to my mother with it and exclaiming, there is a name for this! I just watched part of that documentary and... wow. I relate to Danielle so much. I am actually around her age, too, and I have fought my battle with my weird mute tendencies and come out on top, but I still deal with the aftermath. I had to desert all my elementary school friends to get a clean slate and give myself an environment where I could comfortably talk and not have it turn into a big deal, like she was afraid would happen with her old friends.\n\nSometimes I still have moments where I revert back to my old self and I absolutely hate it. Like, I will be sitting in class with people who are not my friends but are all friends with each other and I am left out of the conversation and I just feel so alone and like I am back in my 10 year old self, struggling to be included in things.\n\nSometimes I find myself in stressful situations where I have to talk and I freeze up for a second and cannot get the words out, but then I force them out with years of practice and words just keep tumbling out of my mouth because I am too stressed to limit what I say to a normal amount so I overshare instead because I find that it is better to say too much than to say nothing at all and be 10 again. (You can probably guess that from the length of this comment.)\n\nI was never diagnosed and sometimes I am afraid I never actually had it and I am just an attention seeker because I overcame it completely on my own, but then I hear stories like Danielle\u2019s and something just tells me *this was me*. I do not think I will ever forget the time I was sitting in class on the first day of 6th grade and somebody complimented my shoes (after trying repeatedly to get my attention because I did not think they were talking to me) and I managed to say \u201cthanks.\u201d Not too bad for my first time talking to anyone my age in school, if you ask me. Dear OP please give me some advice what you needed most from parent/ people you felt ok to speak with, with regards to support, or anything helpful towards feeling more able/confident to speak. When I think about it, I really dont't know how can I help myself when I was a kid.  Maybe it would help if my mother was aware that my quietness in school was a problem.  She told me I did not have friends in kindergarten because I was very quiet in school.  She did not saw that as a red flag and did not do nothing to help me. I wish she could gone to a professional therapists for help.  Afterwards maybe talk to my teacher about this. Thankyou!", "Struggling with speaking Hi,\n\nmy whole life I have kind of gone through 'silent' phases and recently I have been completely stuck in one but I cannot seem to get any help with it without a therapist saying I am selective mute? I have a long history of abuse and PTSD and anxiety and I tend to go quiet when i am stressed or something has happened etc. I want to talk but sometimes i do not have the words or it feels like there is something in my throat physically stopping them from getting out and I hate it. Does anyone know of anything that may help? \n\nThank you! I have used sign language and writing/typing when it is the kind where words and sentences are formed and it is just the mouth that does not work. I do not know how to make these time periods less frequent or shoter, but I am hoping that dealing through the trauma could help. I have undiagnosed CPTSD and my mutism comes on with emotional flashbacks and panic attacks, which I can calm myself out of pretty well and I have developed good and healthy grounding and coping mechanisms, I have built myself a support network, which allowed me to reach out for therapy, and dealing with the trauma seems like the one thing left to do. I have dealt with the now, so it is time to deal with the past, in order to heal and get a healthier future.

The only time I was ever motivated in a day (19 years) to want to talk, to want to actually combat my own disdain of talking.....was june and july.

(\n\nThere will be a point when relaxation becomes a training method rather than its common association with leisure. It is a skill. What I usually do is hum as often in my own home. Humming, singing, talking, or chanting will improve your vagal tone. An improved vagal tone will stimulate your vagus nerves, which will induce your rest-and-digest/parasympathetic system via acetylcholine release, GABA, and body-produced endorphins; you will relax when you use your vocal chords. Slow breathing all the time as well. Then there is meditation and hobbies.\n\nCheck your resting heart rate (when you are normally sitting down). Ideally aim for less than 80 BPM.

My child has been diagnosed for over a year now. She does not talk to adults primarily but whispers to friends. Lately she is shown some interest in attending overnight camps. \n\nHere is my worry- when it comes to being silent I am worried she may be more at risk if she were to be targeted by someone (bullied, attacked or sexually harassed). \n\nIf you were ever found in a bad situation would you be able to talk (or scream) to bring attention to the situation? You could give her an emergency whistle, and/or a safety necklace. I think I would have fought back, but not necessarily screamed out for help Thank you so much for this suggestion. Great idea. Thank you. No.  And this is why I was targeted. I am so sorry to hear this. I hope you are ok and safe now. I am. No, also targeted and raped when I went to a slumber party. I got a rifle pointed at me when I tried to scream.\n\nSchool camps with adults / more adults around was safer. Got To let her have a life. There are always going to be risks, but this seems like it is a pretty low-risk, high-reward trip. I was targeted by a predator when I was in high school because of this. I was not able to call for help. That was high school though, idk a school camp does not seem too risky. I do not know all the causes of SM but for me it was mainly due to trauma (abusive mother) + low socialization. I had a helicopter mother who never let me do anything with her not there and it really diminished my social skills to the point that i had to learn them all in high school and college and am still learning them. Part of my low-confidence was that it was self-perpetuating: she had made sure everyone treated me differently or special and they did and it re-enforced the idea that I was special and need special treatment. \n\nI was in a few dangerous situations as a kid and although I did not scream I found ways to report things to an adult. For me no, I could never scream if anything bad happened. I recommend getting a personal alarm for her, I carry one around with me and it makes me feel safer. As others have suggested, getting a whistle or other sound device is a fantastic choice here. There are plenty that clip onto backpacks or coats and activate with a simple pull or the push of a button. I hope she can stay safe and have fun without either of you having to worry. &lt;3 I struggle with this thought process. I agree she should be able to live her life. As her parent, I do need to make sure she is safe. With the others suggestion (whistle, etc) I agree. This may be a great option for her. My fear entirely. I am sorry you had to go through this and I hope you are in a better place now. So far in the early grades it is not too bad. \n\nThank you for sharing. Thankfully I know that she is able to report to adults. It is while the targeting is happening that I am afraid for her. Thank you. I am looking into these devices for her. Yes there are so many great options now ! \nThank you for the support. Whistle lol\n\nIf you would feel comfortable sending a more chatty child, then there should not be a problem. The mute in selective mutism is a defense mechanism, your child has good defenses, defenses that other children lack. It is unlikely she will put herself in those positions. She may face some bs from other kids but she is just got to learn to roll with the punches. Thanks, yep.", "My inability to speak is frustrating and i feel trapped I do not know if i have selective mutism but i been struggling to speak to others for years and this year was my lowest of the low. When school ended and summer started, i barely kept in contact with my best friend, which apparently really worried her. I just do not know how to talk to her anymore. I feel like when i try to speak nothing can come out. Sometimes i do not know what to say or have nothing to say. It is easier to write and type things out kind of. Another big problem is speaking to my boyfriend normally. I have the same problem with him and sometimes he has to constantly pester me to figure out what the problem is. I know it can be really frustrating to deal with. It gets even worse when i talk about my feelings and problems. When i finally opened up to him about my past i could not say a word and had to text him it. A few weeks ago when i opened up about how crap mentally i felt at the time. It resulted us almost taking a break and even though we worked it out. That incident really messed me up for a bit while afterwards and i have retreated back in my little box of keeping my feelings to myself. How do i easily talk to my friends and boyfriend Idk how long it is been for not speaking around them, but just get back out there in ways. I am in the boat where I want to change but at the same time I would rather hide away. It is been at least 8ish years since I have spoken normally around my family. When I do embarrassing things I just go back out there as soon as possible, otherwise it starts to mess with you (and that is a general mentality, but nonetheless)...I am still working on speaking, although the sooner the better for progress. \n\nAnd I do indeed have no clue what to say anymore, the last time was probably 7th grade when I actively hung out with a friend group. It can be a little awkward at first, but communicating in other ways is better than nothing at all. If your boyfriend and other people are aware that its easier for you to write and type than speak then you could start regularly communicating like this (whiteboard, notes app). \n\nIf people know that you are not talking because it is something you struggle with, rather than because you are mad at them or anything, then communication becomes a lot easier. When I cannot talk (which is only some of the time, my mutism has greatly improved), I let people know by texting or writing it, and then we can communicate like that. I think the most frustrating thing for people is not knowing what is going on.\n\nWhen you have nothing to say but still want to interact with people, you could do an activity where speaking comes secondary, such as playing a game, eating, watching something, making something together. Good luck x", "Friend with SM advice? I have had a friend for over ten years who I believe has had SM since kindergarten (his parents mentioned it but he never did himself). I have been struggling lately because we just graduated high school. I have been feeling kind of sad and frustrated (and even a little jealous) because I found out he talks to friends outside of school from volunteering and soccer. He is told me before that he does want to start speaking to me but probably wont because he feels comfortable in our current situation and usually does not speak outside of his home unless if he has no other choice. He usually only speaks to people outside of his family if they are strangers to him. I sometimes feel like we have not been able to connect on a deeper level due to his SM but I also try to understand him as best as I can. I would really like for him to be able to talk to me in person one day but I know he said he probably wont. Honestly, for the most part, after ten years I have accepted that he wont talk to me, but once I heard his laugh in a video his friend posted. After that it kind of hit me that a small part of me still really wishes that we could speak to one another in person. This whole situation has made me unhappy and it made our relationship more tense and strained but I doubt he knows. I do not want my friend to feel like he owes me anything or needs to talk to me. I am not sure if I should even tell him that it hurts my feelings because it is not his fault and I feel like I am incredibly selfish for wanting him to talk to me knowing that it is not entirely in his control. I want talk to him about how I feel so that I can be transparent with him but I do not want to upset or offend him. I also do not want to pressure him either so I am not even sure if I should say anything.\n\nOur circumstances are really unusual so it is hard to find people to ask advice from but I am really glad I found this subreddit. I just do not know what to do. If anyone has any advice that would be greatly appreciated :) I know that this is sometimes hard, but please do not take his SM personally. It is not personal, at all. People with SM cannot choose who they can or cannot speak to, or where and when they cannot speak. It is not deliberate. Also, do not pressure or bribe him to try to get him to speak to you. This does not help. Pressure to speak makes people with SM much more anxious which will make it even harder for them to be able to speak. The best thing you can do is be patient and understanding. Hi, thank you for replying! It is nice to be reminded that it is not personal, I do sometimes forget :(. I definitely will not pressure or bribe him. Thank you for your advice, it is really helpful to have someone with SM let me know how to navigate this, especially since he does not talk about it himself. I usually find it hard to start speaking to someone I have known for a while if I have never spoken to them before. Harder than starting to speak with someone new. I find it helpful when the other person asks without pushing:\n\u201cWould you like me to help you to speak with me?\u201d\nIf I feel comfortable enough, I do want to. It might be different with your friend, but you can ask and make it clear that it is okay if he does not feel ready as well. That makes me feel less pressured. I find it really hard to say the right words sometimes so this really helps! Thanks for replying, I am glad to hear your perspective on this :) Remind him that you do not mind his sm, and that you understand that talking is not easy for him. Treat him like a normal kid, and when he does one day talk to you, do not overreact. Act like it is perfectly normal, and overtime, you guys will be having full conversations. Have you suggested writing or texting or messaging?\n\nMy daughter and I are selectively mute, and I think that she speaks more to newer people than she does, say, to her long-standing doctor, or to me.  I would like to try some therapy, for her, me, us, so that we could communicate more, and so that she might learn to push through the SM when she can. Just curious, did you get to a point where you do not even ask your friend questions anymore? I wonder because it would be even more pressure for him to initiate a conversation with a \"contaminated person.\" Since his only identity with you is a silent one. Not sure how you would transition back into causally asking the occasional question, if it is been years. No expert here, my childhood social anxiety has nothing on SM. Hi, I am not too clear on what you are asking here, but I do text him almost every day and since we have graduated I have started occasionally going on runs with him and we do hang out in person. We never got to a point where I would not ask him questions anymore, but I do not mention his SM unless he mentions it first. I certainly got off on the wrong foot. Sorry about that. What I should have said:\nSounds like you have been an incredible friend. So many years he is relied on you to be his voice to outsiders. It is amazing that you have been there &amp; probably withstood some uncomfortable questions &amp; what-not from others. \n\n   I have been studying SM cause my 5 year old daughter has it. I have come to realize that despite not wanting to be center of attention,  they still like to be complemented, quietly unenthusiasticly congratulated, asked questions in a low key way... Seems like you figured that out on your own. So really you are suffering from being someone he was always quiet around &amp; him having a hard time changing his identity as being someone who speaks to you. \n\n   I have no room to give you suggestions. I have respect for you. My daughter would be lucky to have a friend like you. I hope he can move past this. Best of luck.", "My commonapp essay on SM Hello everyone, I hope your days are all going well!! I just wanted to share my college essay that I wrote two years ago (with minor edits) on my struggle with selective mutism- thought you all would appreciate :)\n\n\u2014\n\nSunset flame swabbed the treetops, making them glimmer like rubies. I puffed up the mountain trail, dodging rocks. A fluttering Alaskan breeze brushed my face like a gentle caress. To listen to the wind in the leaves took me away from the hustle and bustle of thoughts, transporting me to a place where I was at peace. \n\nI reached the summit when the sun cast fire on the Alaska range on my north. I looked around\u2014 Denali, the tallest mountain in North America stood at my west. Dall sheep clung to slopes, laughing at the laws of gravity. Flycatchers dove for insects, ptarmigans soared through the sky, and droning of cicadas added onto the orchestra. This was the most breathtaking scene I have ever encountered. \n\nAs I scanned the landscape I noticed one tree among the masses: an aspen with bright red leaves, like a stray drop of paint on a yellow canvas. Amid the sea of trees, it was the only aspen with red leaves. It stood at the same height as the other trees; it too quivered in the wind. How did it get those colors? I did not want to think in terms of cold scientific terms of genetic variance, where it was just a lucky individual to inherit that pigment. Did it feel lonely? I knew that tree's dilemma too well, being different.\n\nDifferent\u2014 If I were to play back all the times people had said that to me the tape would go on for a decade. Even when I first entered a classroom, that word would become my label for the rest of the year. But the word \u2018different\u2019 itself was not used. \u2018Quiet\u2019 was. I was diagnosed with Selective Mutism at a young age, which was a fancy way of saying you cannot speak in certain situations, even if you wanted to. Throughout my school years I yearned to be that kid who made friends without breaking a sweat. However much I tried, that desire slipped further from my grasp by the day. I soon knew what a monster loneliness was. That feeling when you long for something and know you could never get it was the worst feeling in the world. \n\nThe only way I could live with my severe social anxiety was to write it all down. That is how I got introduced to my destiny: writing stories. I started with neighborhood happenings: that woman across the street with a crazy poodle or the time I left my electronic pony out in the rain and a constant neighing from outside which kept waking me up. There was something about silence which made you a keen observer. The world became my canvas and I was the artist, painting people around me, their conversations, motives, quirks, with layers upon layers of hidden desires and backstories. That girl who wore plaid everyday became an undercover agent. The boy who played in the sandbox was a dragon trainer. \n\nPretty soon, the sun bid a final farewell, and then I was back on the trail. That is when I noticed something on the ground. A heart-shaped leaf clung to a stone, quivering with a fiery gleam. I picked it up and held it across my hand. \n\nI rubbed the leaf against my finger, the waxy surface still fresh. Suppose there was no need to change my leaf color. \n\nAs I continue my ascent for identity, I will never forget those quivering leaves on that aspen tree. Regardless of which road I take, I know my personality which I had fought against for such a long time, is slowly becoming my greatest asset. That is beautiful. I always wondered what teachers thought when I wrote personal pieces since I say so little.", "Can not having friends drive me insane? Ok so this is not directly about selective mutism but it is from it. I have not had a friend in years because my past ones left and I cannot make any new ones. The only people I ever talk to are my dad, brother, and occasionally my mother.\n\nI also have not been in school because i have been doing a homeschool program for half a year. My dad wants me to go back to regular school but I just cannot bring myself to do that. I had nobody there. I went to the biggest school in my state and I was tired of being around all of those people.\n\nWith how isolated I am I do not seem to be that mentally ill. Sure i am depressed and anxious but do not feel insane. I have a fear that someday I will eventually go insane though. Is this possible? I mean, im still sane so... (i think anyways)...idk, id assume that it wont effect you in that aspect I do not know that it would make you literally insane, but it may make you more depressed, as isolation fuels depression. I know not everyone with SM is comfortable even online, but if you can, try making a few online friends. They still count. One of the biggest things I learned in treatment was to not give in to urges to isolate. Not that it is always a choice, though. When you are alone, anxiety takes that oppurtunity to run wild and you sort of go down a rabbit hole of thought distortions. It is healthier to have a support system. To have people who can help your thoughts stay rational. It is easy to get lost in your head when you are alone and it is likely the anxiety will get worse and less rooted in reality.\n\nI have had this fear as well, that spending years without any friends or support has damaged me somehow or drove me insane. But when I have that fear, I will just challenge it and remind myself that this is an instance of causing myself suffering by putting an emotionally charged label on myself with no real evidence, and try to move on. I understand that these thoughts sometimes come uninvited, but I do not think this is a productive thought that you should actively engage in. \n\n( is an article that goes over challenging thought distortions. I have found thought challenges a powerful tool to keep me grounded. Maybe they can help you as well. I am sorry about your isolation and anxiety. I hope things get better. Not having friends and isolation are not exactly the same thing. There are different meanings to isolation. So if you consider not having friends to be isolated then consider that there are many people who do not have friends. They go to work and come home everyday. Run errands and stuff like that.  \n\nIsolation like you do not go outside. Do not have a job. Are not in school. Being in your house 24/7. This kind of isolation is more likely to drive one \"insane\". Isolation can make you sick. It can make you depressed or anxious. It has a lot of undesirable side effects but it does not make you a non person; you are still a human being. I have heard loneliness can be very detrimental to the body and mind, and my personal experiences corroborate that.\n\nI did essentially nothing with myself when I did online schooling my junior year, and then again during a gap year between high school &amp; college. It has taken its toll. Not having friends is not necessarily an issue but rather having no support system would be. It also depends of the quality of those friends too. I\u00b4d rather be on my own than be surrounded by shitty friends with toxic personalities. I think that as long as you\u00b4re surrounded by a loving support system like family, that\u00b4s ok. I think there would definitely be an effect from lack of interations with people on the long run though (not insanity though but more like depression) but with varying degree depending if your self worth comes from external validation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour parents sound supportive but maybe they have no idea how to deal and improve SM. Going straight from homeschooling to school and forced social interactions sounds like overkill. Are you currently seeing a therapist?", "Forcing myself to speak I am autistic, so I acknowledge that my experiences are a bit different than some of you all in here, but I think that is also because of how I *force* myself to talk when talking feels like the worst thing in the world. Sometimes when I speak it feels like I am being suffocated and my words feel heavy and unbearable, but I talk anyway. I see a therapist and when I see her tomorrow I was going to suggest/try typing out what I want to tell her in a text to speech app and then press play as making myself more comfortable with not talking. Does anyone relate to not wanting to talk, but forcing yourself to? Yeah, some people with Selective Mutism are able to force words out. It makes me feel like crying, though. I cannot force myself to. And I cannot move at all in situations like those, with a therapist or other person of significance. I cannot force myself to talk a good majority of the time. I cannot even write out what I am thinking, and I also find it hard to even gesture yes or no. It is like someone is stuffed cotton in my head and it is soaked up all of my works. Very much related to this it is so hard I am in college and everyone in my class talks amongst themselves and tells jokes and really gets to know each other but I am always left out and I feel as though when I want to say something I cannot the words just do not come out unless the teacher has us do an assignment together and I usually use as few words as possible as well as write down on paper what exactly I am going to say like if The teacher asks me something or have to respond to someone I think better writing the words down and then trying my best to get what I wrote down out into words it is hard and difficult but I do what I can usually if things do not have to do with class I do not see the point in communication even when I want to anything social has always seemed very hard for me your not alone No, because I *do* want to talk. Selective mutism is never deliberate. If I try to force myself to speak no sound comes out. But most of the time when I try to force the words out, nothing happens. I cannot even force my mouth open. Of course, sorry I was not claiming to be mute, just that I have a somewhat similar experience due to being autistic. I am really sorry, I get it though. When I am at social events I normally just end up listening and watching other people than actually speaking. And when I do speak I just want to cry.", "3y/i with SM Hello everyone!\n\nWe noticed that our daughter (3yo) had some tantrums in which she was completely silent-she  had tears running down her face and she was visibly frustrated but would not say a thing. \nLater on we talked with her kindergarten teachers and they said that she also does not say a word there (she is going there for 6 months). \nWe have started family therapy and the therapist clearly is leaning to selective mutism, because she is completely normal child when she is with family but when someone whom she has not seen for a while or some strangers- she does not speak ( sometimes whispers something in my ears). \n\nI would like to ask you, how can I help her?\nI can see that she is afraid to speak and sometimes she just says that she simply does not want to talk. I have tried to bribe her, to speak for her and to joke with her while someone is behind her-nothing works. \n\nI have read many post about people being diagnosed only in late teens or later. I would like to know your experience and what could have helped you if your parents or family would have known about your condition?\n\nTLDR- 3y/o with SM. How can I help her? Thing is mostly, you just cannot.\nAlso bribing is a very very bad idea, it just adds more pressure and she will feel like being punished for no reason. From my wife:\n\n1) what state are you in?\n\n2) if she is not talking in school they should evaluate her so that she can have an IEP or 504 plan in order to accommodate her needs and this can also help pay for a therapist if you cannot afford it out of pocket \n\n3) she needs an individual therapist that specializes in selective mutism \n4) a developmental pediatrician can help get her a diagnosis  &gt; I have tried to bribe her, to speak for her and to joke with her while someone is behind her-nothing works. \n\nI am sure you had good intentions, but do not do this. Please. Speaking from a lifetime of SM, this (bribing) will only make it worse. I have had many people try to bribe or beg me over the years, but SM is built on top of pressure. SMers do not choose to not speak. The more pressure you give, the harder it will be for them to speak. It may also worsen the SM longer term. \n\nWhat you CAN do: \n-Give possibilities for alternative communication. I like to imagine anxiety growth in 3 zones: comfort, growth, and panic. For her, it sounds like Nonverbal communication is her comfort zone. When she is expected to speak by someone, try to repeat the question towards her so that she can whisper in your ear. That would be her growth zone. What you would *not* want to do is demand a verbal response. That would be her panic zone and is thus unproductive. Side note: If she is in a situation where she is struggling to whisper in your ear, see if she feels able to respond at least nonverbally. Basically, doing this all allows her to communicate without being just rescued. \n\n-Give plenty of time for any response. Maybe count to 10-15 seconds in your head before moving on. Sometimes a response takes a bit of time to come out, and if someone moves on just as you are going to respond, it is really frustrating. If she appears completely unable to respond, move on.\n\n-Do not go crazy if she is able to be verbal. This may be a bit different per Child, but offen times people with SM do not want attention drawn to them. Acting really happy if they speak will cause more anxiety and may make them more reluctant to speak in the future. \n\n-Therapy! Nobody here is a professional, and we are all speaking on personal experience. I strongly suggest researching a good SM specialist, or a psychologist who understands how SM works and how to treat it. We live in Europe in Baltic\u2019s. \n\nShe is already going to the private kindergarten so there are only max 10 kids in her group and she feels good there and can get all the attention she wants and needs. \nCurrently we are going to family psychotherapist  and I simply feel a bit discouraged by all the expensive \u201cplaying\u201d there. I know there is a reason for everything we do there but still... I want to help with something else. Because it is a real struggle to see your baby all curled up inside while other kids are having fun. Thank you for your advices!\nI know that I cannot expect from there that she would suddenly start to talk with everyone I just tried to somehow show her that talking is good and she would feel better afterwards. \n\nWe have been going to family psychotherapist and she has learnt us few things as you also mentioned not to make a big deal out of her sudden talking and not to remind her that she is not taking. And how to ease her anxiety. \n\nSometimes is feels like she is just not talking in spite of something because when few days before we had our friend come by she just went CRAZY ( in a good way), laughing, screaming and just going ham. But she did not speak. Right before she was going to bed she just started to talk to him like nothing has happened. Moments like that really confuse me. About the bottom paragraph, that is pretty typical. Sometimes SMers may be comfortable enough to make sounds, such as laughing, but not full words. There is a huge difference between the two and it is a big leap. After she was around him for a while, it is likely she became more comfortable with him around and started being able to speak. SMers do not not speak out of spite. It is not a choice. You cannot approach it that way. \n\nFree course for parents from one of the SM psychologist who are at the forefront of treatment Thank you!\nI will definitely check it! Here in the United States it im depends on what state you live in and the resources they can provide (hence the question about what state you live in). But Dr Kurtz is a great way to start. My wife has also joined a Facebook group of parents with children with SM and sometimes she gets ideas from them as well. I wish you the best in trying to get help for her. Keep pushing and trying to find ways to help her and do not give up. Children are very resilient. More so then we think. I would not assume it is SM immediately. It could be another condition for all you know. Go to your family doctor and tell them about it they can refer to a physiologist to diagnose it and get her treatment. Hers seems severe so I do not think there is anything you can do you need a professional. Please get one ASAP! They are very hard to get and the longer you wait the worse it will get.\n\nDo not try to bribe pressure or make jokes, you do not want her to feel ashamed or pressured about it. Everyone is different so getting a therapist to find a technic that works for her so she can slowly gain confidence is very important and I understand you are trying to help but be very careful what you say as SM is very easy to make worse. She needs to have a safe place.\n\nI have had a teacher try to bribe me with skittles.. I now **hate** skittles and get anxious when I see or are around them", "Is it possible to develop selective mutism after early childhood? I am sure it started when I was around 9 years old yep, not a fan of true Scotsman argument, the DSM just describes it as a set of behaviors. \n\nAlso, from my story, I think it showed up the first time I ran into an impatient authority figure. That just so happened in kindergarten and not in preschool. It was still there before, but it was accommodated for. Did you also acquire this because of a teacher?(Sorry for my bad english) I do not know, but my kindergarten teacher definitely made an impact on how people saw me. It was the first day of school. i think my difficulties with sm symptoms started in/after second grade. my history is weird cause as a baby/toddler i was super shy, for a few years (like from 5-7) i was super social, and then i started isolating and having issues with social anxiety and mutism again\n\nbut yeah, like the other guy said, i do not think there is a set age on when you develop sm My son stopped speaking at age 11. how was/ is his experience at school? What do you think that triggered your sm? my brother got bullied in elementary school so our parents pulled us both out and started homeschooling us. then they started getting really weird and protective of us to the point that they were isolating us from even other family members. I think to a degree that instilled a fear of people in me that is far too extreme and has ultimately become a phobia, and to a degree I just forgot how to talk to people lol Did it got any better? I have not found a way to make it better yet but I am still pretty agoraphobic. I will say that for my junior and senior years of high school I went back to a traditional school and I did not say a word my junior year, but then I made a friend and I could not shut up. like I became a nervous speaker in school and literally *could not* shut up. which, ironically, because I said so many overly personal and/or cringe things (which I usually reserve for the internet), I now have even worse flare-ups\n\noh, I did just remember something. I took a public speaking class and for the first 2 speeches, I had everything I was going to say planned out and I did not even stutter. for the last one I forgot to prepare and I was stuttering and my voice went hoarse and I think it was purely adrenaline that let me get any words out at all. so idk if that means anything\n\nps sorry if a lot of this does not make sense, I just woke up and I am still a bit groggy lol So you have problems with stuttering too? I would not necessarily say so, it usually only happens when I am going from able to talk to unable to talk. kind of like the tightness in your throat and chest that, for me, starts before I lose my voice", "I  have an appointment with a psychiatrist but I do not get what is going to happen because of my selective mutism, I will not be able to talk to them. The appointment is about my mental health, all of it. I have possible autism, severe depression, severe anxiety, social anxiety, selective mutism, borderline personality disorder, eating disorder, I self harm and I am low-key suicidal, and possible schizophrenic tendencies. A \u2018complex\u2019 case apparently. Idk how I am supposed to get help if I cannot talk to anyone about this. I have seen two psychologists I have been able to talk to, but before those experiences, in my teens, I saw two different psychologists who I was unable to talk to a significant amount of the time. I did not say a word to one, because my abusive mother was there in the room with me, and that badly triggered my SM, but I was unable to communicate this. The other one was a social worker I think, and she would loudly sigh every time I struggled to respond, roll her eyes, I guess she thought I was willingly being \"difficult\". Her lack of empathy and lack of an education regarding selective mutism led to more and more little humiliations until I was soon completely mute as well.\n\nIf you fear selective mutism might impede communication at your appointment, I suggest you bring this up as soon as possible. You would probably have to educate them on what selective mutism is, as it is not well known.\n\nYou can try writing about your experiences having difficulty communicating, talk about how you have heard of selective mutism and relate to the sufferer's struggles, and hand over what you have written in your appointment. Could you try writing some things you would like to communicate ahead of time?\n\nIt really depends who you get, but a lot of mental health professionals really do want to help and will work with you solve problems. Give them a chance and see what happens. Best wishes. I have an app called 'tell me' where you type in words and the app speaks them for you, could something like that help? I came here to say this. Use whatever method you do feel comfortable communicating in. From this post it seems like you are able to effectively write your thoughts. I would suggest starting there. this might not be helpful in your situation but do you have anyone that can go with you? i always see my psychiatrist with my dad. he kind of just talks for me which is kind of annoying but helpful. \n\nwriting stuff down before an appointment might be helpful. i do not like the pressure of having to write stuff down during the appointment cause of them watching me", "Have you been made to think you are 'special'? I do not know what it is about the quiet kid trope but it is always portraying the \"quiet person\" as special. That mysterious one who must know something. It is somehow gotten into people's heads that it must be true. Growing up, people acted like I must be something different but not in a good way. It is a way that makes you feel so isolated because you get it drilled into your head that you are too different. It is so alienating the way people have interacted with me growing up. Their reaction to my mutism and social anxiety have really had a big part in my cptsd. I am having such a hard time feeling like I am even human. I cannot feel a connection with anyone. I just feel so alone. I recently came across a phrase that resonated with this - toxic maturity. Kids who get praised for being \u2018mature\u2019 but are actually just struggling to connect socially with their peers. It really hit home for me. \n\nI think part of the problem with SM is we can be so easy to overlook. By its nature SM is not a condition that draws attention to itself. It is easier for adults to deal with quiet children than loud, confident ones. So sometimes I think SM and associated anxious behaviours get praised. Meanwhile SM kids actually need help and support to overcome the anxieties that make life so hard. And peers often exclude us and make us feel weird. \n\nThe lived experience of SM is very different than the perceptions others often have of us. It is tough for sure. But we are human and humans are complex. It is ok to be mad at people\u2019s incorrect views of yourself and it is ok to challenge those views. I only really found my voice by moving away from everyone I knew and their impressions of me. I hope you can find some peace too. Oh, I had not heard of this before. Adults treated me poorly as well but it still fits? I am definitely looking into this. Thank you for your help! The part about the wrist thing suddenly gave me flashbacks to when I was little and this older girl would sit on top of me and tickle me to force me to talk.

How can I tell someone, \"Hey, just now I did not want to have sex but since I could not communicate that to you it was easier to just go with it and think it will be over soon enough.\" Sometimes I get in the mood and enjoy it, and sometimes it is just... bland. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not know what to do. I feel like I cannot be in a relationship because it is not fair to my partners either.

I have suffered with SM my whole life but have not been treated. I know if I would have gotten therapy or something early on (like ten years ago) I would be in a better place now, but just curious if it ever goes away on its own? Personally I am not really sure any of the therapy I got lead to me speaking. At a certain point I think I grew out of it and felt ready to talk but everyone around me expected me not to talk so I still could not. I went me school with nobody who knew and suddenly I was talking to everyone. I am still no social butterfly. I still have anxiety. I still struggle to find words. It is not gone but I am mostly in control SM is known to be something you can grow out of.\nI had therapy since the age of 4, so almost 19 years ago, so I cannot tell much.\nIt does get better, but you got to work for it. It does not come from nothing. I feel that. When everybody\u2019s so used to the fact that I never talk, it seems impossible to break that (because everyone would make a big deal that I suddenly said something and that would really trigger my anxiety.) I suppose some days are better than others, although I never truly understand why, but I do hope it gets better someday Do you have any tips to practice getting better at talking more? I got therapy as a baby and when it dipped in my preteen years it never went super bad, so take this as you will. Time does help but it alone is not enough, you can totally do it at any age and with or without therapy though. You have to do some work, start small and work your way up. It is easier the less it affects your life so it is good to go back to pracgice early if you feel yourself start to slip. Any tips for achieving this in a school setting? Depends on your personality and your current situation really.\n\nGet used to talking and listening to yourself, record yourself while talking (preferably with a camera).\n\nGo out, do not really talk with someone, but get under people (can be hard with corona).\n\nTry smalltalking, say hello to cashiers or try to strike up a little conversation. Ask people on the street for the time.\n\nAlso try getting into some for of sports, that way you can meet people and get some confidence!\n\nThese are the ones out of the top of my head. Make yourself incapable of avoiding it and go in with a script at first. If you feel panicked you can leave and try again another day, the break time is gold for this ability to just leave. Do not give up, do not be ashamed of the awkward moments, they will not remember it after a couple days. Eventually make it a routine, start saying hi to your teacher when you enter the class and they are already there. They do not need to even hear it at first, you can just mouth it and then whisper it and grow your volume from there. If you get a joke in your head during class, whisper it to yourself. When you whisper to yourself and there are other people around you slowly train yourself that other people hearing your voice is okay. From that you can start practicing conversation. The unknown of what the other person will say. A good one you can do with a script is surveying. Go to some people with \"Hi, do you have some time, I am doing a survey.\" Have a line prepared for rejection and if they accept. Then have a question or two you ask. I asked people's favorite ice cream flavors. Wait for their answer in between, write their answer down so you get listening trained. And have a finishing phrase like \"that is all for me. Thank you.\" And you can just leave. This set up allows you have all of this written down in front of you and you can just keep your eyes on the paper. Then you can start practicing improv, go to a person with no other plan than to say hi. Use what they are wearing or what you know about them to ask a question and allow them ask a question from you and you provide some kind of answer. It can take some tries. Then just keep getting better at improv and you keep getting better at talking, performing being a different extra step you can take. Thanks! I will try those Thanks for the advice! Yes.   I have transitioned from selective mutism to social awkwardness \ud83d\ude02 Haha!

Tldr; I do not like speaking at times, does not always rely on my mood, can only use ASL when relaxed/in a good mood as anxiety kicks in and I end up forcing myself to speak anyways.\n\nHello, I am not always fond of speaking. When asked a question that can be answered with gestures, I usually tend to do that. When put in a situation where I HAVE to speak, it takes me a moment, and my voice tends to be either tight, curt, rushed or slurred from the stress/pressure of having to do so. The earliest I can remember being like this is early middle school. \n\nThere is times where I often just do not wish to speak, or speak as little as possible. A few months ago I started learning ASL, I found it very fun to learn and do, however, I end up only using it when I am in a good mood, but do not feel like speaking (meaning this \"Mutism\" does not always rely on my mood, I could be in a very cheerful mood but not wish to speak). Anxiety kicks in if I try to use ASL when not relaxed or cheerful, so I just end up making myself speak in the end. I reaaaaally do not want to just claim to be selective mute. I also do not have any trauma (I do not think) or physical disability that prevents me from speaking. I can talk just fine with my friends unless this feeling is particularly strong. Anyways, sorry for the rambling, I will end it here! (Also sorry if this is not the right place to ask this!) It does not sound like you have SM. It seems more like a mixture of refusing to speak and some anxiety. Go to your GP just in case. It does not hurt to look into it Since selective mutism is not when someone refuses/does not want to speak, it does not sound like you have it. You likely just have social anxiety disorder. For me it is something like when I try to talk, I simply cannot. I want to, but the words do not come out at all. This used to happen only sometimes, like at the grocery store, but now it happens all the time. The *best* I may be able to do is a sort of hoarse whisper. If I am really nervous, my hands start to shake and even writing to communicate becomes difficult. Strangely tho, I can still sign (ASL) at that point. \n\nOne day at work some customers were making fun of me because I could not talk to them, and I was shaking so bad I could not write, so I signed that I could not talk and got a coworker to help me. \n\nI hope my experiences helped with you question somewhat. :)", "Silence taken as betrayal The other day I had something said to me reminescent to what my childhood felt with social anxiety/sm.\n\n\nThe teacher was helping me out on something at school. I was totally nervous because I seemed to take a lot of his attention because I had some major tasks to do and some people in my group were absent. \n\n\nSo he was kind of irritated. This is cooking school by the way. Usually I am loud since I got over these ailments awhile back but one thing stuck out when he was helping me pour out a heavy pot of custard onto a tray. He told me to tell him when to stop. I was so distracted at how angry he was at me at the time so I blanked out and a little bit spilled over the edge but it was not the end of the world. He said \"Seacucumberunder! Why did not you tell me to stop?! If I were to get hit by a truck would you let me get hit?\"\n\n\nThis did not happen a lot where I fucked someone up because I did not say anything but it just reminded me of the disappointment and frustrations I caused the adults around me as a kid.\n\nThere is also this video of this YouTube animator called Tabbed in her video \"Being mute for 3 years\" where she was in detention? I think and something happened to the teacher and she did not say anything and the teacher got angry at her later saying she could have died iirc \n\nIn the world we have to look out for each other. I do not blame people for being angry if I messed them up by not saying anything but not being able to speak up really sucks.", "How do I get myself to be able to speak during therapy? I have had selective mutism for about 6 years and recently its been getting better. In certain situations I am able to speak. However recently I have been forced to get therapy due to the fact that I was almost hospitalized due to my suicidal ideation and they would not let me leave unless I accepted therapy. I want to be able to improve and talk about my trauma but a few days ago when I went to the session I could not speak at all because it was such a stressful situation for me. I do not really know what to do honestly because I know that my therapist cannot help me if I do not speak and I feel bad for seeming so uncooperative. I really hate myself for being this way honestly but I want to get better. It is your speech therapist's job to help you speak. I dont have a speech therapist and he is not a speech therapist either. I think I have to figure out a way to communicate why I could not speak in the therapy Can you just tell them you have selective mutism? That is what I want to do but I am not sure how because I dont have access to any of their contact information so I would have to tell them during the next session and thatd be really hard for me under the circumstances. My mom is taking care of all of the details and she is my abuser so in scared to ask her Can you write it down and hand it to your therapist when you see them next? Thank you that is a good idea. I think I will try that Is your therapist aware that you have experienced trauma? Are they working with you as someone who potentially has ptsd / trauma like symptoms? \n\nThese things can make a world of difference because there are techniques now which can help people who have traumatic experiences process them without having to talk about the experience itself. \n\nBut your therapist can only help you get these therapies - for example EMDR, if they know you have memories you have not processed.\n\nI would encourage you to write a letter, or record yourself talking about trauma getting in the way of your speech so that your therapist can understand you better. \n\nMaybe using whiteboards in your session would be nice for you? Alternatively there are different therapies like art therapy which can help your body become more comfortable, and eventually increase the times you are able to speak. Bring a small whiteboard with a pen and eraser to your appointment. Allows your therapist to ask you questions and you to respond quickly by writing on the board. Email and journal writings can work as well. See if your therapist will go for a walk outside. Sometimes that helps me open up. Play a card game together while you talk. Or color or draw together to take the pressure off of talking. Try the chat feature on zoom, or text back and forth. Is there someone you d feel comfortable talking openly to? Can they join on the call? I assume it is over zoom. If not, try talking to them immediately before you talk to your therapist, you will be in a more open and relaxed state.", "I am going to try to talk to my friends today. That is basically it. I have been able to a few times, but I have not for the last 4-5 months. I am going to try again today, since we are going to fight the ender dragon on our Minecraft realm and I do not want to be stuck with just typing in chat. Hopefully that should make it easier, since they will be more focused on the dragon and preparing for it. \nI have got an hour to mentally prepare myself, and then I have got to try. Wish me luck?\n\nAlso not sure about the flair sorry.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to actually say anything because I was pretty anxious and focused on the game, but I am going to try again sometime soon so hopefully that will go better.\nStill pretty proud that I was able to get far enough to nearly speak though ^-^ Good luck! Good luck! Good luck Good luck! /hoping it went well I am late to this so I hope it went well! :) good luck!! How did it go? How did it go?

Good luck next time!", "I have even more motivation to get better at talking more. (Flair as this because it kind of makes sense?)\n\nMy best friend, who is also my boyfriend, is most likely moving schools at the end of the year. I want to be able to talk to him at least when we are alone, so that I can call him. So far, I have talked to him once in person with the help of the school mental health nurse, and last night I was able to talk to him and some friends over a call. We were playing Among Us, and they were using a call to talk, while I was typing. I decided to try taking, and was able to say at least 10 different things! It was the closest my boyfriend has heard to how i talk to my family. It was a friend\u2019s first time hearing me talk properly since around 3-4 years ago. It was 3 of my friends\u2019 first times ever hearing me talk. \n\nI want to talk to him so bad. I want to be able to see him every once in a while in person, and be better than the last time. \nAnyway, this is my new motivation to get better at talking.   Congrats to you, I hope you can talk even more. I am here cheering for you. Congrats! I hope things continue to work out for you guys:)", "Art therapy and Diagnosis I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now and she said that I likely have selective mutism (I already suspected this, but I had not mentioned it). It feels good that she thinks I have selective mutism and she is now going to sort out a way to help me get more comfortable with speaking. One thing she has done is suggest I see an art therapist. So at out last session we went to see the art therapist at the same place to introduce me to her and set up an appointment with her. \n\nI am all for trying anything to help me. I am generally quite creative (as I have been told) but usually with paper crafts and I prefer to experiment and make new things in private. My appointment is in two weeks and I am quite nervous for it. Does anyone have experience with art therapy before? If so, what is it like? I think knowing more about what to expect might be helpful.\n\nAnother question: What does a diagnosis sound like? My therapist brought up selective mutism and she seems pretty certain that I have it but did not use the words \"I am diagnosing you with selective mutism\". I do not really think that she would say those words like that but I am just not sure if her words were indicative of a diagnosis, or not one yet as if she will talk further about it next time, or not at all? Any advice from someone diagnosed would be nice. Thanks :) Do some art therapy at home and bring it in perhaps. Maybe get a sketchbook of sorts and every day (or whenever you feel) draw out your emotions with one day being one page of whatever conceptualise your feelings of that day.\n\n\nI dont go to therapy but i do a sort of art therapy at home and i prefair to draw digital. Just draw my feelings and keep it in a folder. For me its a good way to get emotions out of my system", "Advice for interacting with an SM family member. My niece has SM and does not talk to her family. I married into the family but she did not talk to me even when her uncle and I were just dating. \n\nI had hoped that when she became an adult she would be able to open up, but she is in her 20s and still has not. I have learned (from this sub, thank you!) that it is anxiety based and will not just go away. But I have anxiety too and I do not know how to talk to her about it because I do not want to make her uncomfortable!\n\nI try to treat her like anyone else, but that means that I often forget to phrase things in a yes/no format, and then have to rephrase, which calls attention to her not talking and I think she hates that. She is visibly uncomfortable when someone brings up that she does not talk.\n\nI feel like I have missed out on getting to know an awesome person because she does not talk, and in an effort to not favor one over the other, I missed out on my nephew as well. It makes me so sad because I love them both and want a better relationship with them.\n\nThis ended up more of a ramble than I intended, but is there any advice you guys can offer on what to do/not do? How can I be better? How can I/should I even gently encourage her to get therapy? For starters, be sure to never ever pressure her to speak. SM is not deliberate, and is actually driven by the pressure to speak, so doing that will only make it worse. Even bringing attention to the fact that she does not speak can add pressure and more anxiety, which you seemed to notice. Sticking to yes/no questions is also important in making her feel more comfortable. There is nothing worse than me being asked a very open ended question, and then I have to sit there in the embarrassment of everyone watching me, just waiting for the response that I cannot say, even though I want to speak. I do realize that sticking to yes/no questions may be difficult to do and remember, but it is really crucial. \n\nAnd, if she ever were to speak to you, *do not* bring attention to the fact that she just spoke. I do realize this can be hard, but if you make a really big deal out of it, it only brings more anxiety to speaking again in the future. So try your best to act like it was completely normal, and respond as you would with anyone else. \n\nNow for other means of communication. Would you be able to text her? Note that not *everyone* with SM can text, but some are able to, and it might help her feel more comfortable around you in person as well. It is worth a shot. Yes, for more complicated stuff she will type a text and show us if I cannot guess the right answer.  I do try my best. But sometimes it is inadvertent and honestly, some resentment does sneak in. It hurts. Thst can make it hard to be sensitive. I will try harder though. I understand. I know this can be hard sometimes, but always remember that her SM is absolutely NOT personal. People with SM do *want* to speak, but they just *cant*. As an SMer, I still feel horrible for all the people that thought I hated them because I did not/could not speak to them. That was not the case. Honestly liking the person makes it harder for me because I feel more pressured to act appropriately and it just adds to the anxiety surrounding speaking. ", "Is it possibly selective mutism? I have not always been like this up until more recently after my anxiety levels shot up a couple years ago (and was diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder). I have found that when I am overwhelmed enough in a situation of conflict\u2014typically with my parents\u2014I end up \"shutting down\" (or so it is been called) and being incapable of speaking. I want to speak, because it is not as though I am trying to avoid communication. I physically cannot get the words out.\n\nLast week was when I really started questioning the possibility of having SM. I left home after just arguing with my parents, and was not able to talk throughout the day until six hours later when I finally entered a comfortable environment (my art class) and even then did not get much louder than a whisper-murmur. Is it possible that this could be selective mutism, or is it probably just something else? It is gotten to the point that I have wanted to try to learn sign language to see if that communication is comfortable when I cannot vocalize.", "Jobs that are willing to hire you..? Are there any jobs that would be okay with you not being able to speak..? \nEspecially if you offer like.. No special skills.. \nI doubt it. I know there are jobs like libraries and factories that may ease it but in general I suppose. Or just suggestions such as that. Well, i guess you could always ask the employer if it will be a significant problem My first job was being a dishwasher. Do not really need skills or have to talk to anyone. \n\nSome other jobs you could look in to are, delivery driver, garbage man, stocking shelves, working in a warehouse, petroleum inspector, or a custodian. I think anything outside of those you would need a bit of schooling or experience. register with the department of rehab online. Try internet or tech-based jobs. If you have basic writing skills, you can blog, start doing some social media management, or simple copywriting. Entry level stuff in tech is actually pretty easy to find, especially if you are down to work remotely. \n\nLet the employers know in your cover letter that you are mute and would need accommodations like only communicating via email or the chat box in zoom. \n\nThere are many companies in progressive areas like Silicon Valley (look for remote positions if you do not live there) that actually look to hire people with disabilities and would find ways to accommodate you. Working in a warehouse does not require hardly any social interaction. Sure, you will have to talk to your bosses and stuff sometimes, or the person training you, but other than that you just work and then go home. i recently heard of an SMer being a home cook for a living, delivering meals, etc. just one more suggestion. If you cannot cook, meal delivery is still an option Library is the best place to work for a person with SM. Ironically, I am studying English Teaching in university. A teacher with selective mutism?? I have no other option than studying English as it is my only skill. I am planning to search for a job somewhere else which needs English-Turkish written translations even though I will graduate from English Teaching. It is a significant problem in like 80% of jobs. I am so glad you mentioned this.  I hate when people think all we can ever amount to with sm is being a garbage man or something. But there are actually lots of great jobs out there. I have sm, and personally know someone that does too, and she has even been on tv. She is a crazy cook who makes crazy cake sculptures, and is well appreciated. And people accept she does not talk, but still made it out in the world.", "Question about SM and animal lovers? I do not have selective mutism but I am a speech therapist who has worked with several children who have selective mutism.  Many of them are animal lovers, like at a rate that seems much higher than you find in the general population, which is cool.  I am also an animal lover and would characterize myself as being more on the sensitive/anxious/shy side sometimes, although probably not as having an anxiety disorder of any kind.  Anybody have any ideas as to why people with SM seem to be animal lovers more often than other people?  Just curious. :) I am not too sure why, I quite like animals as well. I think maybe most can communicate with animals without talking, so it is quite convenient and reassuring (?) I guess. \n\nOr maybe it might be due to the fact some people are just more sensitive towards animals :-) That makes sense.  I like that :-) This is a really good question and I am excited to hear others' thoughts! I have never been officially diagnosed, but just from my own reading I think I may have had SM (when I was younger) and social anxiety (now). Definitely very shy. I have been an animal lover as long as I can remember.\n\nI think for me, I feel more comfortable with animals than people a lot of times. Maybe it is that I am not worried about what they are thinking of me like I tend to be with people. They do not think differently of me for being a certain way. I can talk to animals and be super comfortable working with them when there is no people (or just my family) around. If I am working with animals when there are other people around, I often do feel anxious, like that I will handle the animal wrong. That said, animals have definitely helped get me out of my comfort zone to interact with people better. If I am working with an animal along with somebody else (I used to work at a vet clinic), the animal is something to talk about and look at and work on with them so it is not like a normal conversation which can be hard for me. They have also been a motivator...like asking a stranger if I can help groom a horse, something I would never normally do if a horse was not involved. Animals are my easiest thing to talk about...like if you want me to really talk to you let us talk about animals:)\n\nWhen I was about 12 I did some horseback riding that summer and had a favorite horse there. One of the instructors noticed me hanging out with him and said that she would noticed shy kids seemed to especially bond with that particular horse. I just thought that was interesting.\n\nOP, have you been involved in animal assisted therapy of any kind? That is pretty much my dream job :) I like animals because it is easy to communicate with them. And as long as I respect them, they will respect me too. Growing up I always felt I could relate more to most animals than I could to people. I spent a lot of time with dogs cats and a few other animals but I became pretty good at reading (and speaking?) Body language. I felt like I could communicate with them more easily. \nPlus like others have said, there is no judgment from animals... Well maybe from cats sometimes I absolutely love animals. I have pets and I see them as my own family. I am also an equestrian and I am obsessed with horses :)\n\nI have always felt more comfortable around them, and when I was struggling the most with SM i would whisper to the horses. Animals are not judgemental like people are so i think it makes it easier/pressure free. No, I have not been involved in animal assisted therapy but it does sound like a really neat thing.  I know we had a counselor at my school who had a dog that would do therapy with her. :)  One of the teachers also often brings her dog in and the kids love him.  I do volunteer at an animal shelter, and I love that I love my bird more than I love most humans Because I am pretty sure my cats never judged me that I worry people do. It comes to me to stay with me, to get food and be petted. It is a very mild form of socializing for me and it generally raises my mood often. Or, it relaxes me.\n\nCould probably be the more reflective nature of mutism has on someone but I am not eloquent enough to get that point across nor am I sure it is that simple. Like, would I not be vegan at that point then and so on. I like animals, especially ones that let you snuggle them and love you back. I love my dog and she lets me snuggle up with her and she makes me happy. I like animals, but not a lot of them! I only like cats and other fluffy animals as well as a few insects! i have SM and i am an animal lover as well! for me i think it is because animals obviously do not talk so they do not judge you and you can just talk to them and they will listen and will not be annoyed by it.", "SM does not exist   Guess ptsd does not exist too. And all of the other mental illnesses Those are all fear based... signed somebody who had PTSD.  So psychoses and schizophrenia also come from fear. Thanks doc. Please tell me one mental illness that is not fear based? \n\nBipolar \nADHD \nPTSD \nSchizophrenia \nBPD \n?  Lol I thought I had schizophrenia too it is fear based. To make you feel like you are crazy and you are experiences are not valid. Funny how you say thanks doc as if they have not been giving 12 year olds lifelong OxyContin addictions over a knee scrape        ", "how do i ask for help? i still live with my parents and have never had any kind of diagnosis, therapist etc. i have never been able to speak or make friends at all since i have started school. i figured about SM probably around a year ago, and have been pondering it for a while and i feel like i have the majority of the symptoms. i suspect SM, but i am not going to self diagnose. i have never opened up to family, or anyone, about anything in my life such as my feelings or thoughts and i am wanting some kind of help or anything, really. my incapability to speak has really impacted me a lot more mentally in the past few years more than it ever has. i do not know how to tell anyone about it though, or ask for help. i fear it even. any advice for this??", "Selective Mutism or just a werido? ", "I would very much enjoy getting better. Is there a way? \n\nI am 21. For as long as I can remember, I have frozen up when someone talks to me. Classmates, teachers, staff, coworkers, managers. Strangers are the worst. I have no problem talking to my gf who has similar issues as me. I can talk to my parents just fine although sometimes our conversations go south due to their inability (sometimes unwillingness) to understand my illnesses. \n\nI feel like life is passing me by. I am so scared of becoming old and missing out on opportunities and experiences because I am too scared to communicate. \n\nIs there any way I can better myself? I do not really want to die like this lmao. I think therapy/self work is the only way. I have only begun working on self healing over the past two years, and I feel like my childhood, teen years, and youth were wasted (I am heading close to 31 now). So get help now while you are still young. It does help, and the earlier you start, the earlier you can begin to reclaim your life Do you have any suggestions for how to work on this? I recently started seeing a new therapist. But I think we are in the early period where they still need to get a feel on what is wrong with me. I have a ton of separate issues that I am also trying to work on. My appointments are kind of spaced out, do you have any  tips to make progress in the meantime? I think as a start you can browse your library website and see if there are any self help books that you feel would be helpful to you. I tried doing a Google search on selective mutism and mainly just found books that target either the therapists or relatives of those with SM, but maybe you might come across a gem I missed. If you do not find any, I think you might want to give self help books on dealing with social anxiety a try. I have both SM and social anxiety, and I suspect the two are related. Whatever self help book you read, u need to do the homework/exercises they recommend in order to see results. Just reading will not help \n\n\nI have not been to a therapist cuz I was scared they would give me homework to approach strangers or something \ud83d\ude05. The self work I have been doing is kind of unconventional cuz it is not following any one specific book. I have been doing a bunch of self reflection and emotional release for the past two years because I have realized all the baggage from my childhood years up to now is still here. If the question I want answered is \"why do I clam up in front of strangers?\", I will try to bring up a time when this happened recently and see what emotions get triggered. I allow the emotions/thoughts to come up and cry if I need to. The stuff that comes up for me are usually these:\n\n- fear of rejection \n\n- frustration with myself over not being normal \n\n- feeling like I am broken \n\n- feeling like I am going to mess up of I say the wrong thing \n\n- feeling like I am going to mess up by not talking too, but not talking is better than saying the wrong thing \n\n- feeling like I need to make the person like me, or else I have failed again to make a friend \n\n- feeling paralyzed \n\n- feeling like I am not worthy of hanging out with normal people \n\nI do all this in the comfort of my own home when in a locked room, so nobody will see that I am very depressed and crying. I give myself the space to do all the crying I need for now until I feel ready to move onto the next thing. Each of these sessions is painful but actually does take a small load off my back. Keep doing it and at some point the reasons why you go mute will come up. I just found out the other day that I recognize my dad's bad qualities in myself and have felt the need to restrain them in order not to be disliked. I was already feeling this way during early childhood. There are probably other causes too that I will discover as I continue this work but this is the closest I have come to the root cause so far.\n\nI am also doing a bunch of work on self acceptance. I used to always think everyone else had something that made them likable but I was missing that mystery quality. I have been realizing lately that those people are able to be themselves because they feel comfortable in their own skin, which I never have been.\n\n\nI feel like my social anxiety is gradually lessening, and I am becoming less uncomfortable with speaking over time as a result of this work. I am actually saying yes to social events now rather than trying to find a way out of it. And I used to feel a strong terror about going to one, but now it is a more manageable level of fear. This is very painful, long-term work, but it is worth it imo. You come to like yourself better after acknowledging and accepting those negative emotions\n\nAdding: if you choose to try out what I did, just know it can be very draining and you will have to practice self care, take breaks, and give yourself time to just do whatever you want to cheer yourself up. Be kind to yourself and go at a pace that is comfortable for you Omg I am 21 and you sound exactly like me, I just started doing therapy, I am not chatty with the therapist yet but that is what I am going to fix lol, I will let you know how it goes, I am also on meds, dunno if it does anything for the SM but it definitely helps with my other issues and anxieties", "I just wrote about everything from the summer up until now. I just have no internal push, there is not enough to make me want to forcefully push myself. There was, but there is not now. It is a lot. I have Contamination OCD (hate talking about that one) and SM, I could dive off for either, but I will not. I was fine talking about all this stuff, until my Mom comes angry at my door because it is locked. It is locked because of the wall....and you are getting angry? It fucks with me.\n\nAnd now she is yelling at me for telling her to leave.......you see, I have no motivation to tell her why I am annoyed at her, because she asked 'what is wrong?'.................there is a lot wrong, I just have 0 motivation to translate what, to her.........she does not understand that I cannot translate anything like that. It is just damaging.\n\nThe time I did progress was when I had the motivation to, that was the summer (and I ALWAYS mention the summer, if anyone pays attention to me in particular)...it was just the one time, I had the motivation above anything else to want communication in my life.....even if it meant being uncomfortable. I know I can speak, it is not hard.........well it is. Just in my mind; it does not take that long if to fully speak if the motivation was there. I believe in a day, I could start speaking fully. There is no want to, and it would definitely be uncomfortable as fuck, but I always know that I could....Though, what happens if I do? I feel like if I did, how does that sudden change affect me? I do not have a concept of it.\n\nThe time I had motivation was from June 28th to about August 1st is when it was gone........this girl approached my family and I, in the Target parking lot. late at night....just a family trip in my car, casually. So she was going to write a note, but she did not. She just spoke to us. I guess she wanted to speak to whoever owned the car, and that was \"me\" (my Dad actually does).....so my Mom pointed to me, and wanted me to speak to her...but talking does not work like that, so I just nod and deflect but, just from the start of it all........when she came out of her car (she had just whipped into the spot next after spotting my car)...that girl was the PRETTIEST fucking girl I have seen in my entire life. Then she said she had owned the same car, her brother texted her that \"her car\" was at Target...and she wanted to talk about it. But that all never happened. It was awkward because she had to talk to my Mom and brother, and they do not know that much about cars. I was never nervous though, idk usually I am with girls. There was a level of trust there that usually nobody gives, and it was so refreshing...........of course in the moment, I never picture anything more. I never have, I did not when I liked the first girl I ever did in 7th grade....or when I kind of liked someone other girl, later.\n\nLiterally she was stopping us to give us car parts, she was leaving for Florida the next day, so she lead us back to her house with her car. She was going to give us parts from her old car (she owned the exact car I had) for free. On the way there everyone was like 'this is the perfect girl for you...,' and so on...........but for me, even 19. I cannot picture doing that........but I almost was allowed to, I have always been conscious of that. My Mom told me to come out to say 'thank you,' but I never did...she just got the parts from her, and that was that, I sat in the drivers seat waiting, and my sibling are disappointed I did not go out. Besides a phone number she gave my Mom, she got to exchange pictures. Idk I think there were other reasons why she got the number, but idk....and my Sister is now talking with this boy (she is 16)...and having him over, and it is casual, but for me, I just cannot picture it. IT was just the talk of the night after we got home, ofc then it was brought up a few other times, and I never said no to pursuing something, but I would not know how...someone would have to push me, and even then idk how that would work....when.....it just would not work.\n\nAnd it was only until the last 3 weeks that I have stopped feeling anything towards that girl, and I know that is creepy. But it is honest. Though it was only a month in, that is when I lost that motivation or hope of anything more than that night....which was really nothing more than a good deed.\n\nThe rest of the summer I was just in this euphoric hope, but now I look at it, as dumb. August comes and everyone gets Covid, and the summer basically ends there. It was a very family oriented summer.....Idk, but since then I just really have no motive, to speak. For a while, I was just sad as a Bitch. Now I am just sort of indifferent, not really super happy like I was at times during that Euphoric time....but equally then, I was VERY sad too. I could have just gone to the beach with my family then, and that made me EXTREMELY happy, and I know when I am that happy, I am just THAT fucking happy. I know that happiness and motive exists, it is just not present anymore.\n\nI have not been that happy, since though. Now I just stay away from everyone most of the day, besides the time they invade the room, I reside in.\n\nThere is been no real progress since July, and I will only count July as the most progressive time of my life. Every sense of 'progress' made since, is this sliver of false hope by others, I do not count it because it is a one time thing when it happens; a spur of some motive to say something. I only speak when I have motive to.\n\nI do not believe anyone in my family, to understand what this is; in a capacity that is good enough to help me in anyway meaningful, it was only the time when I had my own motive, I went out of my own way for the first time since SM really became a problem. I went out and picked up food for my family, and that KILLED ME inside, but I wanted to do it, I figured it will feel that way, until eventually it will not. I saw what you guys were saying...but it was never enough time for me to see any change in how I felt. I just eventually lost my motivation to want to continue fighting.................When my SM became a huge problem, it was Middle school. In elementary school, really about Kindergarten, or 1st grade was the ideal time to tackle this. If it was known or understood....maybe it would be no problem now, idk? I do not think it was ever known, but it was not ever questioned why I spoke at such a minimal rate my entire life. Until it was.....and I think that was around middleschool, but it was never something my parents involved me in, I was unaware of what I had until highschool I think, I just casually get told one day....\"you have SM...\" Oh, ok...........I had no clue what that was. \n\nSo from then on they get teachers to try to get me to speak more in highschool, but I push it off as a joke....because I do not want to be associated as such, and they eventually stop trying. I managed to make friends by standing out I guess....I initially made my elementary friends by myself, I actually had my first friends, who were these 2 girls, and they bought snacks for me....and joked with me, I would eat the crackers I had for lunch and one of them went how 'it is like my brother's underwear,' so I always remember that....but one day I ditched them because I thought 'it was uncool to be friends with girls....' When I became friends with my \"best-friend.\"\n\nReally I cannot re-call that 'best-friendship' much, and it was from earlier in elementary school until 7th grade of middleschool, then we grew apart, but I cannot remember much....not when it came to communicating with them. And my second friend group in middleschool, I hung out with them a lot, but it was really the same thing with communication, besides Xbox, where I did speak more to them.............in highschool I managed to get into my 3rd group of friends....and really ALL of these friend groups had recurring friends over due time.....idk I was definitely not the kid most would associate with, I guess they thought I was weird, most of my 'friends' were more mutual and they would make jokes.....but the usual ones, it did not bother me.....some were hostile and I stayed away, but nothing out of hand. I actually had a YouTube channel where pretty much anyone who knew of it, heard my voice....but I still never spoke in school. And my family has no clue about that channel, and never will.\n\nThe only people I did talk to somewhat normally, were my highschool friends since I was so social with them on Xbox, although still limited in ways. I hung out with them a few times (last time in 2019), but I became known to not really ever.....hang out. Now I just never get asked. It is been since 2019 since I have really played Xbox consistently and I want to get back into it, but idk it is stressful in ways....since I have not normally conversed with anyone and I will only ever get close to that conversing... over Xbox and nowhere else in my life......besides xbox, and that friend group.....though there were still limitations, the most i ever spoke in a REAL group face to face setting was with that friend group.......it was just fine to do, I may have never really sparked any conversation, but if I had it was anywhere it was with that group. Though even then I had no real motive to try and speak outside of that group, or who had tagged along. But they do not know what I have....they know 'I am mute' but they do not really understand it.....not to my knowledge, they are chill though, and I respect them a lot. One kind of reminds you of FaZe Rain....the way he speaks.\n\nNo where else or since.\n\nIf I try to speak more, it will just be out of the will of nothing....and it is hard to pull something out of nothing. MAYBE if I knew what the 'otherside' was like, I would want in. But there are no drives besides the ones I mentioned. And I know lust or love is not a sturdy base for motivation, and it is not easy to re-create. That was the second girl I ever was REALLY intoxicated by, and the last time was about 6 years before........I do not find motivation in anything simple. I do not see the end-goal as something to strive for, which would be being able to communicate.\n\nOf course, I have FOMO (I will use that phrase) of my lack of being able to communicate. At the mall with my Mom, Sister, and Brother this last Friday (so Black Friday)....we went to this \"comic-store\" (not a comic store) and it was just cool, I saw a Juice WRLD shirt on the wall, and I really have come to like Juice WRLD in the last few months, unreleased songs and all. I just really relate to it, and nothing else. I wanted in....but at the same time I would never wear anything like that, but I want to....but I am also afraid to. I fear my Dad in that he is just overly judgy, maybe he is not deep down but on the surface he judges everything and anything, it is annoying as all fuck.....my music taste is actually unknown to my family (besides old rock, which is EH....because I relate more to Juice WRLD...and other shit, when I am not only listening to Juice WRLD, sometime in the future)....And I am VERY annoyed and just want my Dad to go away everyday, we used to go driving in his cars on the weekends and we have not in about a month and a half. He has not asked.\n\nI also went to a Jonas Brothers concert at night (I write about everyday, so THANK GOD, I can re-live it as much as I want to), and I have been to concerts before with my Dad, to classic rock concerts....and they are great, I love the music, I can appreciate it....but I HAVE NEVER BEEN to a fucking young person concert until then, that was October I think, it was just the best night. Every one was singing to the songs just playing on the speakers, and it was fun. I will always remember that night, and I just \"happened\" to be the one to go since my other sister could not, or did not want to.....My older sister brought me, and it was just us two, but it was just great.  I dig the Jonas Brothers, they are fun...and all that 2000 music, Hannah Montana...it is nostalgic and a great time period.\n\nAt the same time I want everything that I long, to love. I am disturbed by myself for partaking, and of what others will think of my likings, or really what I will feel when they know of what I actually like........I like a ton of shit, I would LOVE to be able to actually play Juice WRLD while showering, but I just play nothing. That other self scares me, as much as part of me...is that self. Maybe that is the more true self, idk. I also love Ariana Grande, or at least for a long period of a year or two....now I just listen to Juice WRLD cause I relate to it. And maybe I would actually like to buy Merch of both, but I cannot. I liked Logic for a short period post Everything....but eh...\n\nEven back to Xbox, the last time I was on it, I can no longer speak super loud....my family used to be able to hear me from everywhere and I never really was effected by that, I even SCREAMED the loudest in my entire life in a rage at my friends for killing me in Minecraft, very serious business. But now, I have not spoken at a normal level that can be heard much beyond my own door, and I keep my music in my headphones lower, so it does not go through the door. I wish I had a sound-proof room where I could just do what I did, without anyone else listening in, I also wish that with driving and music, that only I could hear it....And I do not really care on the road with music, but at lights I do. Also I feel like I am a danger on the road because other people just freak me out, I just want to get away from them. I feel like I drive crazy, although I am self-proclaimed skilled at driving....though definitely still a crazy and I should not be on the road, driver.........And for the mall, I noticed that I am this confident-soul walking around the mall with my family, but the moment I am stopped in a store, around people....I DO  NOT LIKE IT! I guess, when I am walking I can just pretend I never heard anyone try to speak to me, where in the store I am really just stuck to, having to bolt out or just for the person to go away on their own. I would not speak to anyone in front of my family; if I am alone...there is a better ability to speak to a random person, but not really a greater chance that I would speak to them. If I did, it will be the minimum, until they go away.\n\nI re-imagine that night where that girl approached my car; if it was just me. How does that go? I really do not know. It probably would have gone like it did, the one time I was ordering food (when I was at the mall with my friends)....she probably would not of heard me. I would probably just do as much as I could to get her to go away, but idk....and I do not mean to dwell on what could of been, but I do not really imagine much past the minute.....besides these papers I got to write, and the potential I may get back into Xbox. I really want to play COD again, I miss that. Idk, I think even before my family said anything like my mind was there, I liked that girl........I just-   .....anything beyond that is impossible.\n\nIdk there is always more to write, but I just wrote probably 3k words. The most motive I have these days is to just keep track of where I am at...of something; what, idk? Back when in July, I did it to sort of update everyone....I thought I was Jesus, out here, just trying to do it for my followers or some shit....I kind of wanted to not only speak for the potential of a future with that girl (THAT, that is why. I saw a FUTURE then....that I never pictured before). I lost that, I no longer picture the future, or a future. I am just going to work on this 5th custom album to put together based on unreleased Juice WRLD songs, I call this one DOOM (based on the song, and the word for the other songs)....just need to get the higher quality mp3s....and yeah.\n\nI wish someone would have known sooner or helped me sooner, because now I do not care. Not enough. And I was astonished at a guy not wanting to change on here, back in July, when I did want to change...and now I am that guy. This was just writing everything down, I kind of condensed near the end but.....yeah. Idk. I keep this in a LOG too, I will copy/paste it there. And I just went through it, to idk fix things? yeah....the next part is awkward, and skeevs me out, but....it, is.\n\n**OCD (spoilered cause it is kind of 18+, kind of weird too, not going to lie....and it is not the right place really to talk about it, but idk):**\n\nAnd I also have extreme contamination OCD &gt;!of bathrooms, mainly just bathrooms for this part, I have to shower after pooping, every time........and sex (not that I have ever had it), it just grosses me out, and it grosses me out when people talk too openly about it; jokingly, and I am fine with that, I do that....but otherwise no. Even if I do overcome talking I have to somehow overcome that, and that only adds to my problems....idk how I have a relationship, I am not sex-repulsed or Asexual, I just am very grossed out by the bodily fluids and all that, pee not as much because I have learned that is sterile....but it still smells and is gross, but it is more tolerable than anything else, I do not like to get too specific, more than I need to....these two problems have been for years (since about 2015, I am 12-13 then)......it is a very relevant problem, but I really keep the 'sex one' to myself. In the past I used to be fine with both such things and I was gross, like I did not care....but there was a time when I stopped masturbating (makes me uncomfortable to say that word here or anywhere really, but yeah) for about 9 months .  I got exposed over Instagram with my face for liking pictures of instagram models.....in that Activity section, I had no clue about.....and then later after those 9 months, in school (8th grade) apparently rumors spread I, \"jerk off to porn...\" Which now I would not care, but I think the disconnect screwed me, those 9 months, of becoming afraid of bodily fluids.....and I hate to talk about this, like this because it is weird and creepy, but it is how I think it came to be. Ever since then it is always been such rough waters for me, and I can never, get over the lack of cleanliness of that all.....I do not understand how people are fine with it all. Pooping, ok....I just find the toilets gross and idk how you actually mange to clean anything effectively....that is not as big as an issue in my book though; it is tolerable, just annoying. Although my showers do take about an hour, because I just have to be so thorough (I am cleaning the entire time, nothing else). And I hate to just throw this here, but with that, that is the extent of all my issues, again there is always more to talk about, but that is it.  And it is crazy because as a kid....I did not care about washing my hands after I peed, and my parents just wiped my butt then so I never had to worry about washing my hands. !&lt;\n\nI feel like my SM or Contamination OCD would not be as severe if the other one did not exist. And they are sort of the same, I feel like I can dive off the deep end of either problem and solve it in a day....but then it is committing to the life where I am no longer protected from either of my own anxieties, I am just forced to live with them. And if I did, I just do not understand how to deal with either. And when it comes to the Contamination OCD, I think it will end when I am forced to one day face it, against my own will....and with that I have always felt like I just want to kill myself if that ever happens. I do things the way I do, to make sure it NEVER has a chance to get worse than it already is. Both these things trap me. How it is for me, once the contamination starts, unless you end it....it never stops unless you accept it.\n\nAlso this post is very identifying, I was definitely way too specific on certain things, so if I get suspicious that my family somehow finds this, I am going to delete this. \n\nI think I just spent 2 and a half hours writing this...ok I will be gone now. \n\n3,770 words (idk did it in my Google Doc, might as well put it here)", "Laughs in big cock ", "People constantly thinking you must be fine because your a teen/adult? Does anyone else find that people automatically assume your sm is magically gone when you get older? I get that for a lot of people it does go or at least get a lot better, but I just hate how people assume you are now ok just because your not a little kid anymore. Or another example is if you manage to build up the courage to finally say something out loud to someone that you would not normally say(like to a family friend that you are not close with or in a lesson), they assume that because you spoke that one time that you are now suddenly cured? Sucks my dad expected me to grow out of it, yeah. I am sorry about your dad, for me it is mostly not my family (except the people who do not know me well like distant aunts and uncles), although they do sometimes accidentally put me in bad situations that is hard for me but they just genuinely do not know or remember that I struggle with it, for me it is more people like teachers and stuff, I am sorry it must be hard having to deal with it from your own dad", "Treating SM? Hey, all!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner is 19, and she is dealt with SM pretty much her entire life. She was diagnosed when she was in elementary school, but her parents decided not to do anything because they thought she would just grow out of it. She did not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer SM is pretty pervasive and has been coupled with social anxiety. She is also dealing with some PTSD and paranoia that contribute to an idea that is not worthy of being someone is friend and that she will inevitably make everybody (myself included) hate her. She really is not able to start up conversations with anybody except for me and her immediate family. I have been trying to help her make new friends online and in real life, but it is so hard for her because she is terrified of not being able to speak to them or finding out that they do not really click and not being able to do anything about it or thinking that, even if they do hit it off, she will just ruin it and make them hate her sometime down the line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my question is this: do others with SM have any advice on how to move forward with this? And is it too late to receive treatment? If not, where should she go? Most therapists do not seem equipped to take care of SM in teens/adults. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks! Hello. I am a 20 year old with SM. I definitely agree that it seems harder to get treated as a teen/adult. I think what makes it difficult is the fact that SM is already rare as it is, and I have yet to meet a psychiatrist that fully understood it.\n\nAnyway, it is never too late to get treatment. As for what kind of treatment, there are plenty of options. I personally chose to take medication. In the end, I would say it is mostly just a matter of finding the right professionals that can treat you. My son was successfully treated using the principles outlined on  . We started treatment when he was 5 and worked at it pretty much weekly until he was seven when he finally kicked it. Basically it is graduated exposure therapy. Since your partner is unsure of using her voice and also what to say while using her voice you may need to work on both of those things at the same time independently. rather than expecting her to start immediately by speaking with other people work on speaking with somebody that they consider to be safe to speak with, like yourself, but in the presence of others. If that is not possible at this point then try breaking that challenge into smaller steps like rather than speaking openly with the stranger at the same table as you step by having the stranger be across the room barely within earshot. If that does not work then reduce it further by having her whisper in your ear with them across the room. Then have them whisper to your face with them across the room and then have them speak a little more loudly and so on and so on until you gradually work your way up to the final goal. A lot of phobia therapies I like this where they start with whatever you can handle and through repetition and small advancements, acclimate toward more challenging steps. My son was initially unable to speak even in a whisper with anybody in the room whatsoever. Now he speaks completely open my in most situations. \nI hope it helps. good luck to you.", "Can seeing a selective mutism specialist actually help cure it?  I cannot say anything for sure since everyone is different, but I think a specialist would help a lot because they can give you more specific strategies and ways to cope having studied a lot this condition. I think it is like saying \"would an oncologist help cure my cancer better than a general doctor?\" Like... yeah, they know better how to deal with that specific problem you are having. I would say go for it and I wish you the best! A good specialist, yes absolutely. Personally I went to Dr Elisa shipon-blum (the SMart center) a few years ago and was able to fully recover. It depends. My selective mutism is based purely on anxiety and depression. So the specialist would have to completely cure that for me, which is essentially impossible if your depression is chemical imbalance.  \n\n\nFor others, it may definitely be possible. That is awesome! Just wondering how old were you when you went? I was around 14 I am looking into their services for my son (5 years old), debating between the SMart center and the Kurtz Psychology center.. any thoughts? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, did you do the intensive camps or 1-1 therapy? or both? Any feedback is so appreciated. thanks!!", "Minecraft My second son does not speak to anyone that he does not know... Though he is loud and cheerfull as hell with his older brother and me... We recently started to play Minecraft online and later invited  friends of older son online...\nAnd - ... I am not a specialist..  but sometimes he \nSuppresses the other guys being so loud and excited about his monster battles and achievements...\nThis is hilarious! Happy easter everyone! The difference is definitely kind of funny at times. At home I would literally have to be told to stop talking so loud, but towards people I did not know or anywhere outside the home, I could barely even shake my head yes/no. It is important to have at least somewhere you can be yourself I think.", "Who else takes a shitty hair cut and does nothing? Just got a terrible barber cut where he gave me tiny bangs because \"they are good for when you make a bun\" and missed like 70% of my face. Still tipped as normal and went home to fix it myself... I had my hair trimmed by a barber, who cut my ear with the scissors. I flinched and said OW but he dismissed me with a \"oh c'mon, it is not that bad\". Then he got a worried look in his face and started digging out the paper towels. Yep, paid and tipped, and have been cutting my own hair for the last 10 years. I do not even cut my own ears, damn. I got a bad haircut from a hairstylist about 2 years ago, she gave me a completely different cut than what I asked for. It took over a year to grow out. \n\nBut guess what I did? As soon as she cut it and styled it, I got up and said \"thanks, I love it\" because that is what my parents made me do as a kid so the words flew out of my mouth by default. I could not look myself in the eye for a few weeks after that. It really bothered me that I could not say what I wanted to say.  ._. I had my last major salon cut around 5 years ago (aside from below) because I was tired of being too nervous to say anything. I am certainly no professional but I have been doing my cut and color since then.\n\nMy partner paid for a salon cut and color nearly a year ago and I was so upset with the attempt. I finally spoke up and said it is not what I imagined. They fixed it like halfway and I did not say anything else...back to doing my own hair! Omg I feel like I would do that but I also feel like I would just freak out and then that would escalate the whole thing Same my parents always say to only say it is good if it really is but then tell me to not say you dont like it just because it is not what you wanted A friend of mine did that too! He did not dare say he hated the haircut, and the while friend group had to reassure him for weeks until his hair grew back. Anyone who decides to give you a hair cut, i.e., tiny bangs just cuz, is not a keeper!  My sensory issues were a lot better then. I do not think I could take being in a barber shop now.  My autistic son refuses to have someone else cut his hair, so I do it.  My spouse does his own, and so does my daughter (with occasional trims by me).  Yeah, you can tell. But it is cheap and not as bad as that barber! Had a bad expierience at the hair dresser years ago ... I now cut my own hair I once sat there and let the guy filing my nails cut all 10 of my fingers, 2 semi-deep slits on both sides of my nails, trying my best not to react or wince. I then apologized for bleeding and said it did not hurt.", "Does anyone find Watamote offensive? I find it relatable, but there is this Kotaku article... So, I asked this over on the social anxiety reddit, but no one said anything. Thought I would ask here too.\n\nAnyone watch anime or read manga? As someone with selective mutism and social anxiety, I find Watamote very relatable. For instance, there is a point where the mc forgets her textbook and she just sits there, hoping no one notices, unable to ask her neighbor to share. I think it is pretty clear the author and illustrator went through some social anxiety stuff themselves. But there is a Kotaku article calling it the most mean-spirited anime ever for it is social anxiety depictions. The reviewer does not have social anxiety disorder, far as I can tell.\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you find it offensive for it is characterization? I thought I should check before I go around defending Watamote or critisizing that review.\n\nAlso, how about Hitori Bocchi and Komi Cannot Communicate? I think anyone would be hard-pressed to be offended by Hitori, but Komi does irritate me a bit.  I do not believe it is offensive to people who can relate to Kuroki's daily life struggles and the way she thinks. From what I read on forums published at the time, not many people agreed with the Kotaku article (or anything published on the site in general). I was following everything about the anime before it premiered and while it was airing. I have not heard about this article until now, but I can conclude that the author had no idea what he was talking about. He was portraying her as a victim that everybody was laughing at. Tomoko was just her own worst enemy and those who could relate laughed/cringed at the unfortunate accuracies. I do not find it offensive, and you shouldnt take kotaku articles seriously. \n\nI did have to drop the show though. I could not take the cringe. Okay, thanks. I can understand not being able to take the cringe. I guess it kind of resonated with me because I had a lot of embarrassing experiences in school, and to this day, remembering any of them makes me cringe. Alright, cool. I like Watamote, but I did not want to go around telling normal people it was not offensive in case I was an outlier. But it seems like people mostly agree about the Kotaku article being wrong. Have not seen them but thanks for the recommendations~ So far in this category I have only seen A Silent Voice. It was great Nah, I love the show. I think it is probably the only actual realistic representation of social anxiety that I have seen. I did not find the show offensive, I found it connecting to my experiences in school. A Silent Voice really is excellent. I read it twice and I have seen the movie. And yeah, I do recommend looking into Hitori Bocchi (manga has not been localized in English, but the anime is on Crunchyroll), Komi Cannot Communicate (getting an anime soon), and Watamote. I will say, Watamote does a lot of dirty jokes, so that is something to consider. Komi also does, but to a lesser degree. \n\nSome other relevant anime would be Welcome to the NHK and RE: Life. I have not watched NHK. As for RE:Life, I thought the premise was kind of dumb for a lot of reasons, but, moving past that, I did really enjoy the show, because the characters and story are good. Thanks! I have watched welcome to the NHK when I used to be a NEET (Hikikomori), and it was really relatable. Would recommend. I shall check out your other mentions c: Yeah, that is how I felt too. I would never seen a character so relatable before.", "Common characteristics of people with Selective Mutism - it is more than just the inability to speak.

I think it is actually more common for people with autism to also have SM, so yep, it is. Yes, it is possible to have both.\n\nAnd difficulty expressing feelings is probably more of a characteristic of autism, but the rest are common with SM. It is possible to have both. Also, one thing that might separate the two is that a person with SM and no autism will often act very outgoing and comfortable at home and only feel these symptoms when they are out in public or put on the spot.

It sounds like you struggle with words but can still talk to anyone. SM is when you consistently cannot make anything come out at all with certain people/certain situations. Not knowing what to say or mixing up your words when speaking is not selective mutism. I would say you just have social anxiety disorder. Selective mutism is when you know what you want to say, but no matter how hard you try, you cannot get yourself to say it. The words feel \u201cstuck\u201d. And when I try to speak, no sound comes out. That is something else. With SM we literally CANT. I will try to speak and nothing comes out. No, luckily for you, you probably do not have sm. But if you are worried about what you are experiencing I would never advise against talking to someone about it :) Not really \"lucky\" but not \"unlucky\", since it is uncommon.

Hell, I was not even sure myself. I thought, \u201cHow cool would it be to have a place where we (neurodiverse peoples) could search for one another based on special interest, or other commonality? A place for us to gather and have like-minded conversations, and have it have a little more of a \u201cconnected\u201d feeling than Reddit, which is the only place I have seen the neurodiverse gather.\u201d\n\nPerhaps I just do not know where to go. But That is ok. I started this site and I really hope it will take off.\n\nThe goal is to be inclusive, and I will never charge for membership. We may sell tshirts one day, but never memberships. I will not sell any data from this site either. I am not looking to make money off this, I am looking for an online community for people like me.\n\nThe site is based off a dating site format, so we can have profiles and search for one another. Maybe we will find good conversation. Maybe we will find friends. Maybe some will find romance. I can dream\u2026.\n\nSo two things - 1.) it would be great if you would join me there. and 2.) I am looking for feedback. I want to make it as inclusive for all the neurodiverse, and I am aware that my point of view is not complete enough to make it good by myself. The goal is to be there place where everyone feels accepted, not judged, and free to be themselves. Please tell me how I can make it better.\n\nP.S. Please be kind - the site is super new and there will be issues. Also, it is literally just me - I do not have a \"team\" to help develop and/or test.\n\nThank you! The idea really appeals to me and I made an account. I do not know how much this would appeal to people with SM, but I have co-morbidites that some may say make me neurodiverse, so I am interested. Maybe we should get a chatbox or Discord going so people interested in the site can get to know each other a bit? That is a great idea! There is a forum but I will add a chat of some sort to me to do list. I will get to that fast, just not tonight. \n\nI too have co-morbidities (I dislike that term) and found both this sub and the aspie sub to be helpful. \n\nI think that SM should also count as neurodiverse because it is a way that we are different from the norm. Neurodiverse should not be limited to physiological differences, in the spirit of inclusion. \n\nThanks for joining and for the feedback!", "V ", "Do people WITHOUT selective mutism ever \"freeze up\" (i.e., become unable to speak due to anxiety)? If so, how often? And in what situations? I have always kind of wondered if freezing up was only limited to people with SM I am not sure what counts as \"people w/o SM,\" but it is been decades since I was fully in it, and it still happens very rarely. Only in therapy, really, and mostly when we are discussing things from when I was a child. Like, I get triggered back into that part that had SM, and it is like I am that mute kid.   \nFreeze is definitely a defense mechanism that a lot of people use, though, so I would imagine that it is not super uncommon. Maybe how often or how long it lasts is less extreme. i know a guy whose description of trying to speak romantically aloud - he \"tries but no words come out\" seems vaguely akin to SM, or at least as akin as a non SM person could come to it. freezing up can be seen in some people with ''plain'' social anxiety in EXTREME (and rare) cases or in cases like stage fright, where people who might be able to talk normally might find themselves unable to say anything in front of a large crowd. But for those people it would be a very, very rare occurrence or in very unusual situations they dont normally face. \n\nKind of like how people without anxiety disorders are capable of feeling extreme anxiety but for them that anxiety would be much rarer and tied to more high stress situations. Whereas for someone with an anxiety disorder that anxiety would interfere with everyday life and come from lower stress situations where that anxiety is unhelpful. So freezing up might not be exclusive to SM but the fact it happens so often, or in situations where 'normal' people would not be anxious is exclusive to SM. YES infront of my dad and sister (even if there in the room next to me, i must be 2 rooms away), and my schools head of safeguarding (shes EVIL) I do not have SM, I am here so I can learn so I think I might be able to give you an answer. My best friend has an anxiety disorder and bad depression so he is gotten so sad he stops talking. The last time he had an anxiety attack he was not able to speak even though it was clear he was trying. It was scary because a mental issue was forbidding him from a physical action and that had never happened before. \n\nI have light anxiety myself and sometimes when I get stressed out I stop talking because I am either really mad/sad or out of energy so I \"choose\" to shut down that function. I can still talk but it is harder to open my mouth, it also makes me feel nauseated after talking. It is like I shut down and it helps me feel safer and more calm. Probably, in extreme situations. I have SM myself so I cannot say for sure, but based on what I do know, it seems very possible.\n\nBroca's area is a language center in the brain. And studies have shown reduced activity in Broca's area with stress. The examples given in my source were along the lines of people describing terrible things by saying \"there are no words\" or accident victims sitting in silence after the event.\n\nThe book I read this in (the body keeps the score) is specifically about PTSD, so they were really only focused on severe circumstances. I do not know how much it would be an issue in more everyday situations. I would guess that an anxiety disorder would make it more likely though. And I would not be surprised if it happened to everyone from time to time. How often do you hear of someone being speechless after they were unpleasantly surprised? I do not have SM, I am here for my daughter who does. I am usually talkative and outgoing and yes, I do freeze at specific occasions, although rarely. More so in foreign languages, but also in my mother tongue as well. I have a feeling and I can think of how to say it, but for some reason I do not say anything, even though I could and would like to. It happens the most when I am taken by surprise by my own feelings about something, or am asked for a reaction to an abrupt change  of circumstances. I tend to silence and need a few seconds to verbalize that I will have to reply later. On a couple of occasions when I felt really hurt by someone, it took me hours to be able to speak to them again (or to speak again at all, actually). That was quite weird, as if a lump in my throat just would not allow me to. The more I grow older though, the rarest these situations become.", "Finding friends online? What are your experiences with finding friends online? Where did you meet them and were you able to maintain the friendships by just chatting?\n\nI am feeling really down lately and do not know what to do anymore\u2026 I am scared to express myself in any way at all in front of others (even family members I was close to) You can find friends on pretty much any website. I have met people on Tumblr, Reddit, Interpals, and even on dating sites. On the downside, only one of them stay my friend throughout multiple years.\n\nI would definitely think you should give online friend making a shot. Since humans are social creatures, it is necessary for us to connect with others just like it is necessary we eat food and water.\n\nMake sure to find people with similar interests as you so you have stuff you can talk about. \n\nAlso, I am not sure if you are underage or not but if you are be careful and try to make friends similar ages as you. There is a lot of adults out there who will not hesitate to prey on people younger than them.\n\nI wish you luck! I met my three best friends online. We have been friends for over 10 years and I have only met one irl. We are all from the Caribbean and lived in the US Virgin Islands but on different Islands so it was possible to meet but we never have lol one day. \n\nI met the first one on Hi5, the second on MySpace, and the last on Facebook. I also have dinner other friends from other countries that I have met on other sites such as Zorpia. My favorite is a dude from Croatia. I introduced him to Calypso and he shared it with his now wife and hopefully his soon to be baby.\n\nIt is very doable but online is where my personality actually flourishes. I can be myself because there is no one with me. I do have bouts of anxiety sometimes which is why I have never actually video chat with my friends and only called one on the phone. The rest are strictly text and pics. From my experience it is easy to make friends by following random people on social media then commenting and liking their posts. Preferably follow people with the same interests as you so you have stuff in common. \n\nIf they decide to follow you back and comment on your posts then you can reply and have short conversations. Overtime you guys will get to know each other. It generally takes me a couple of months to get comfortable with someone.\n\nI have made most of my online friends on Twitter and Youtube, and I have even known one of them for 5 years since I was 12! Using this method is muuuuuuch easier than DMing someone because it requires very little social skills and you can take things slow. Of course you can DM them later once you become good friends. The only friend I made online was through Forza Horizon 2/3 and Twitch Streams...before 'looking for group' was a thing. Idk for me, it is always awkward to talk online to other people and I am not too interjecting....but some people just clicked...which was only 2 people, one eventually moved on, and the other I moved on from/they did. Though I would consider the last one an actual friend. They always called me awkward, which I just could not help.\n\nBesides that no online relationship has been more than mutual for me. That is really the area in which I am the most normal with communication, is Xbox Live. oooh! You should try Habbo Hotel!  Idk if you have ever heard of it, It is like virtual chat room game and you build hotel rooms.  I used to be obsessed with it as a kid and early teens.   If you have not yet try it! Habbo hotel should be perfect for you!  Mind you people on there can be jerks.  And Wattpad is good as well, find books that relate to you and make friends with the users. i think i am a bit too old for Habbo Hotel\u2026 but thanks anyways. I am going to check out wattpad I suggest discord, I went through the same phase of becoming completely withdrawn and afraid to express myself to anyone at all, but I was able to make a few friends online. I hope u meet some cool people !!", "Any older people with sm? I am an older person (42) I have not officially been diagnosed with am I have always been shy. About 15 years ago I had a breakdown of sorts and developed paranoia. My psychiatrist said it was psychosis possibly from canibis usage..? However ever since I get really uptight and cannot speak in certain situations especially if I feel someone might be able to hear my voice and how it sounds.... It is totally situational, if I know I am in complete privacy with friends or family then I feel safe to speak and talk normally but anywhere else then I become mute and get by either by avoiding social situations with strangers.\n\n\nMy situation is so frustratingly complex, having depression, psychosis, self esteem issues including paranoia and what I feel is selective mutism.  But it seems this condition generally affects the younger people, so I wanted to reach out to see if there were any older people who have this. I am 24. Not exactly in your age range but yeah. I am 34, and had to self advocate for myself a bunch. you may want to reach out to a local psychologist if you have access and describe what you have said above Been there, got diagnosed with psychosis... But none of the medication I have tried has helped...and I do not like the way the medication makes me feel lethargic...I am about to try micro dosing of mushrooms as I have heard some good things about that.  Also I have some friends who maybe able to help me with paying for counselling too. Thankyou for replying interesting to know it does not just affect the very young. Although you said you discovered it, did you think you had it too when you was much younger looking back? Yes, as far I know. I started therapy and was finally able to tell someone about my childhood rape. we started to find out how I was targeted and I had essentially the entire medical diagnosis  database at work as a programmer and sort of discovered it by accident. Once I read the Wikipedia article on it, it was clear to me that the stories people were describing about their childhood matched up with mine. I started out researching social anxiety, then autism, and finally selective mutism. Thank-you for sharing your experiences and feelings. Sorry to hear of your tragic experience... I feel some people dont understand how powerful the mind can be affected years later after horrible experiences. I am 33, I have had SM since I was 4 but did not actually find out until I was in my 20s. Maybe not what you mean by older, but I am an adult (21) who has it. My twin brother also has it and my cousin who is a a few years older probably does. 25, suspect I have and always had SM. I am also 42 and believe that I had SM all through school. I have always been labelled shy and quiet. I only recently found out that Selective Mutism is a thing. I had never heard of it! I have suffered from anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem most of my life. Maybe because of undiagnosed/untreated SM. I still talk very little and quietly when in a group of people that I do not know well. I find it impossible to initiate a conversation in those situations.", "Day 3 of the Selective Mutism H.E.L.P. 2021 Fall Summit (password:LittleSteps) available for free viewing for a limited time ", "... ", "30 year old former SM Hi all, \n\nI have suffered with anxiety and depression for the majority of my life. It is most evident in work and comes across as extreme shyness. This was also the same when I was at school too.\n\nI recently discovered the link between SM and anxiety and it is started a train of thought about an unresolved issue I had aged 4/5.\n\nOn the advice of my teacher (who was worried about my lack of speech) my mum took me to a SLT, when we were there, my younger sister answered my questions for me. The SLT dismissed this (over confident sister) as the reason why I had learned not to speak in public and dismissed us. It is not told as funny family story. But I am beginning to think that I was in fact a SM. A lot of what I have read in SM has definite parallels to my life.\n\nAs an adult, I live what many would consider is a good life, I have friendships, relationships, a steady job. But I can never shake the feeling of underachieving or perhaps coasting. Feeling someway that I am being held back by my shyness in contributing to larger group/work meetings.\n\nPerhaps it is millennial entitlement, and I am just going through a tough time. But I would love to speak to (no pun intended) anyone who realised they were a selective mute later in life, and I am interest to read about how everyone deals with the anxiety associated with it.\n\nThanks I read about it on the internet at 14. I panicked, talked to my mom about it in tears, but I would grown up as public enemy inside my own family due to my lack of speech. My mom would say I was an embarrassment, spoiled, rude. Some of my teachers were also hard on me, others more patient, but I was vulnerable to internalizing the idea that I was just a bad person because of the way my family reacted to it. I was suicidal at 8, because I noticed it was actually getting worse. As I entered adolescence I aged backwards. As I progressively faced others looking too old to be acting that way, they were harsher and also every year I felt like more of a freak, a failure and lost hope things would get better. I became more dependent on my parents because my basic health was deteriorating every year. I never got help. I talked to 3 different specialists (a social worker, a psychiatrist and a therapist) who I could not basically communicate with. I do not think they could have diagnosed me with anything because of this. All I got out of talking to them was shame over not being able to speak up, and a fear I would been diagnosed a psychopath because of the way my mother spoke about me. \n\nI went to college (now living back in my native third world country) hoping I could talk to someone in the new city I found myself in, but I just crumbled under the realization that I was not able to fulfill my goals (work part time, make friends, build a relationship with my professors) because I still struggled to speak. I had one professor who would come in to class, greet the class in general and then greet me in particular and I would never answer. I hated him and being treated like that but did not even have the words to express even to myself why it was so hurtful, since I would been raised to accept my parent's narrative that I was just spoiled and mean. I dropped out after just barely passing his class. I got nothing out of it, since I could not concentrate on the subject. \n\nGenerally, I was afraid to speak up about what I consider neglect and abuse from my family, since I was clearly sick but they were cruel in reaction and I was right to, because when I finally tried to talk about how I would experienced everything, I was locked in a \"rehab\" center where we were all told we were there to confront the reality that we were the bad guy (they would use a Spanish words that means something like asshole) and failing our families. I got my first job after getting released and eventually cut contact with my parents. But between dropping out and my first job, I stayed home, for years. I think I was frozen in the cptsd sense. I could not make sense of my experiences or my inability to concentrate (I think it is because of trauma). I feared being abused or ganged up on in a work setting because of how I would been treated at home and at school. \n\nI was on medication when I got my first job but I was inappropriate socially and I bam still extremely quiet and do not have friends several years later. But I see a therapist and I am trying to work through everything. I realized i was a SM at 10-11 when i first had to interact with people i had not known my entire life and i noticed how they could just talk to strangers like no big deal.\n\nI have not been so lucky with friendships, love and career, and to this day i feel like my shyness is used against me. I now know, after a few therapy sessions, that my shyness should not be the reason for the animosity i received in my life and that maybe i am not the only one with a problem in these interactions. I also think me being a quiet female is somehow a problem for a lot of people, as if i am not fulfilling my role of being a social butterfly who can entertain anyone.\n\nI have always struggled and i still hate myself some days for being this way. But i am hoping i can still build my own path without carrying the weight of these negative voices. And if new ones show up, i will just not listen because i know better now. Hi not the only one with a problem in these interactions, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 I discovered that I was an SM around age 20, while reading a textbook in college about childhood disorders.", "/r/selectivemutism road to 1,000 game plan I am serious about getting this subreddit to 1,000+ subscribers in the next several months. As a redditor and a moderator on various subreddits for over 4 years now, I know Reddit inside out. This is my action plan. \n\n- Plug /r/selectivemutism in every post and comment it could possibly go. Every subreddit, with a focus on relevant, or large subreddits. Extra good if both.\n - I actively seek out SM sufferers on Reddit by keyword search.\n - (\n- Post on social media (Facebook ,Twitter, Instagram...)\n- Actively create content on /r/selectivemutism. And then crosspost, crosspost, crosspost\n- Ask moderators to allow promotional posts in relevant subreddits\n- Ask people with SM, psychologists, researchers to do AMA's with plugs to /r/selectivemutism \n- Organize fundraisers, giveaways \"sponsored\" by the subreddit - this one's challenging, but an idea.", "Is Selective mutism nature or nurture? A discussion I have had suffered with SM. Though im not sure if it came from an event that triggered it or something I was born with.\n\nIn terms of the event, I remember being in kindergarten, bullied by the teacher in front of everyone for my poor grades. Being sent to her office with her other workmates around, somewhat bullying me. I used to beg my grandmother to never return to school. But other than that, I was quite an emotional kid, maybe it could be something I was born with. \n\nNonetheless, i want to hear it from you guys. Has yours started out from a event? If so, what was it? Or was it something you are born with, such as certain traits that contribute to SM? I would not say it is just one or the other, I think it can be a mixture of the two. Yeah, I was born with it and I was too an overly sensitive child. I would say like most things it is probably a combination, but judging by my family I would definitely guess it is at least partially genetic. Me and my twin both have it, but because our experiences have been so similar that could still be nurture. However, my older cousin also most likely has it, and he grew up in a different environment in a different city. I also have another, much younger cousin who *may* have it, but I have not been around her much so I do not really know, I have just heard that she does not talk much for a kid her age. She is the younger half sister of the other cousin. They have an older sister who does not have it. Me and my twin have both had it as long as we can remember so I cannot really say if something caused it, but my mom said we talked quite a bit as toddlers. was diagnosed at age 2 so it stemmed from nothing. Ive never spoken to any male family member (or male in general) so therapists used to always convince me and my family that I was molested and that is why ive never spoken to men. Maybe I was, but I am sure I was not, I was 2 so I aint remember. i know this is very late but i wanted to add something to the conversation. \n\nmost things are a mixture of nature and nurture but in most literature i have found SM is not usually linked to a traumatic event (although some people report it is for them). personally i displayed symptoms since 18 months, suggesting i was born with it.\n\nlots of research has been done on the more common anxiety disorders like GAD and \u2018normal\u2019 social anxiety, which suggest a combination of personality factors (like neuroticism, a mix of nature and nurture), medical models where anxiety disorders are straight up inheritable diseases and nurture factors like nervous parents produce nervous children by teaching them to be nervous/social learning theories.", "Any advice? I need to talk to people in a situation I normally would not. How do I prepare? Depends on the situation. Do you have more details?  I think you would probably get the best advice from an autism/asperger's sub I do not know the struggles of autism, but what I have been learning little by little in my healing process is that when you feel comfortable in your own skin, you will be able to trust yourself and act in a way that feels appropriate for you. If you are always trying to figure out what is the \"correct\" way to behave and do that instead of what feels right to you, you will end up acting rather than actually showing your true personality. Putting on an act is exhausting. Idk if this helps you or hurts you tbh. Hopefully people in the autism subs have helpful advice for you", "new school it is so lonely. cannot speak to anyone. no friends. presently sat by myself at lunch because i cannot befriend anyone because my stupid mouth cannot talk. spend all day being lonely then come home from school and spend all night being sad about it and then just rinse and repeat. just :( it is so depressing I hope things will get better for you soon! Do you have a good support system at home? I understand you. I spent the majority of my life hopping from one school to the next and it never got easier. Especially when it was high school. I spent half of my first year reading alone by my locker because of the physical blocks forbidding me from speaking. \n\nAll I can say is to hang in there. Maybe join a club that you enjoy and hopefully it will be a gate to forming some type of friendship. I know how hard that is. Sometimes there is a really friendly outgoing person in a class. If you are able to write them a note saying that you want to be friends but you have a hard time talking, they might take you under their wing. Just an idea, there were people in my class that were always really friendly and helpful to me and I appreciated it so much. I like what WinterSkyWolf said. My advice as a former mute and still intense social anxiety is to pay attention to groups that you would like to be part of. Look in the halls, cafeteria, classes, etc where groups of friends hang out, and pick your \u201ctarget\u201d. Find out who the most outgoing person is in that group and make yourself greet them one day. Then another day, make yourself sit by them in class or something. Also greet them that day. Then start sitting by them regularly. Pretty soon that extrovert will start taking you under their wing. They will start the conversation with you. It definitely takes some baby steps to get there but you can do it. \n\nAnd hey, that is how I met my husband. If I can do it then so can you!", "Could I have SM? I (13M) have always suffered extreme anxiety in many forms (Panic Disorder, GAD, Separation Anxiety, Social Anxiety(all diagnosed)) and my therapist suspects I may also suffer from some form of OCD(not diagnosed). More recently my anxiety has developed into an extreme inability to talk to anyone except my closest friends(not even my parents). It feels like however hard I try no sound will come out, no matter what. In these situations sometimes I can gesture or use fingerspelling or writing, but usually, that just worsens the building anxiety because of the perceived awkwardness of the situation. It is almost like to \"protect\" me my body forgets how to talk, I can struggle all I want to make the smallest of sounds, but nothing that requires the vocal cords works(sometimes I can do sounds that only require the manipulation of air like 's' but even that is anxiety inducing). Before this started happening regularly (A year ago, when I moved across the country), I had difficulty talking, mostly because of a lot of overthinking and believing that I would be perceived badly. Sometimes if I am somewhere where I am comfortable I can talk to my parents, but talking, in general, is laborious and anxiety causing. Sometimes I will talk somewhere I am uncomfortable, even initiate conversation sometimes(shudder) because the anxiety caused by not talking in a highly social place like school is even worse(I tried, but finally after a few weeks I was able to force myself to talk in the classroom as long as it was only to my group partners and professor and I only had to speak a sentence or less at a time.) Now I can talk in that class (I only take one class in person) freely to those few people, but iI am about to change classes and I am freaking out. I feel some of this could be attributed to the anxiety caused by me moving to a place where I am highly uncomfortable all the time minus a few rooms in my house and the local ice rink, which would fit with SM being a situational anxiety disorder, except the situation that I am uncomfortable in is the giant state of Texas(yay me!) Also, it is only getting worse, because as I become more aware of the issue I become self-conscious of it and that just makes more anxiety which makes the whole situation worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if the writing is very stream of consciousness style. When I am posting in a public place I have to write very quickly and try not to look back over what I have written to avoid the anxiety that would inhibit me from seeking the help of you amazing reditors. Also, if you were curious I am already on medication to treat my preexisting anxiety disorders and it is one often used to treat SM. And no, I have not brought it up with my therapist, talking with him for more than a few words and only when prompted is impossible, so bringing up a topic myself is probably not going to happen. If you kind people think what I am experiencing may be SM could you point me to some resources that might help me better handle it?", "My child has selective mutism but I am not sure if I should seek other diagnoses to help her or if her behavior is typical of SM Is this a sign of inattentive adhd, autism. or a normal reaction and behavior of SM child\n\n\nMy daughter is very very shy and 4 years old. We recently got a puppy and the puppy usually does not play with her and plays with the adults the most. The puppy started to follow her around the house and she turned around and pointed at the dog and powerfully yelled \u201cno! You did not want to play before so now you do not get to follow me around now!\u201d. Which is unlike her. She seemed to feel guilty but pouty and very hurt despite seeming to know her reaction was wrong. She is very sensitive. Her brother teasing her leaves her standing there silent, shocked, and offended. She had a plastic doll and somehow tripped and ended up bleeding lightly from her lips from the doll. She pouted and demanded that we throw the doll out right away and than later made us get the doll back. She seems to have a strong natural sense of morals and empathy for others but her pouty reactions are a little resentful. She seems to doubt herself- mentions being bad at multiple school related topics randomly and in a sad tone. She gets along with her brother well- she is always willing to play his \u201cimaginary Pok\u00e9mon\u201d game and I know that when he gets in trouble or sent to his room, he always asks her to sneak him food and she always does. She never asks the same thing in return from him and mentioned being afraid he would react meanly and judge her because she felt guilty and wrong for her actions that got her in trouble -and so she felt like if she asked him he would react cruel due to her actions that got her in trouble. \n\nWhen we went out to eat and the waiter asks for her order, she speaks so quietly that no one can hear her and you have to read her lips. She does take things literally but I think all kids do right? She thought that someone being fired literally meant fire being thrown on them. She is a huge fan of princesses and once wore the same beauty and the beast tshirt for a month.\n\n- I know a lot of sources online say adhd a lot of special interests that change constantly while autism has long term special interests. The confusing thing is she had an interest in \u201cItaly\u201d for months- I got her a book on it and she wanted to learn the language and I think she wants to be Italian. It lasted months but she never actually put any thought or care into it or payed attention to the interest. \n\n she played imaginary games and enjoys playing \u201cbaby\u201d and laying in my lap and having me play the mom. But I have seen her drawing on a whiteboard and she is very clearly playing pretend teacher- but if I ask if she is playing teacher she will respond \u201cno\u201d. She is done this before with other things and can be private. \n\nI think She has a fear of judgement or something and that is why she is too scared to talk to her brother when she is in trouble. I think she did not like when things are not peaceful and does not want to see someone react upset to her. I am looking into selective mutism possible but it could be challenging to differentiate if she has autism on top do that or something else. She is very sensitive compared to most kids her age and simple jokes that are even slightly harsh or horrifying to her.\n\nOh she also seems to have very freakishly vivid dreams. She also has a bubbly personality at home when she is comfortable but it can be emotional\n\nSomething super confusing to me is that while she was in day care at an exercise club a random girl asked her to be friends and she said yes but thought it was weird for the girl to ask to be friends because that is apparently not how you make friends. Idk if that shows she is overly critical of socially stuff or the opposite &gt; When we went out to eat and the waiter asks for her order, she speaks so quietly that no one can hear her and you have to read her lips.\n\n&gt; She also has a bubbly personality at home when she is comfortable \n\nThose two things are definitely SM. A lot of the rest I am just hearing a normal 4 year old. If you are worried about autism, ADHD, or other anxiety disorders alongside the SM I would seek out a child psychologist. None of us can diagnose as we are not professionals, nor could anyone do it without meeting her. I am in no way qualified to diagnose. All I can say is that I have autism. I was obsessed with fairness as a child and very upset when social \u201crules\u201d seemed to change. To this day, I am sensitive and have rejection sensitivity which may explain some of her behaviors. I do not understand people as easily as others. My partner orders for me at restaurants on a bad day. Having secret special interests, extreme guilt or shame reactions, and not understanding nuance (like her brother\u2019s playful jibes or metaphors) are also signs of autism. You are doing your best. Be very careful if you attempt to get her diagnosed. It could involve a lot of rejection, which might be hard for her. You could try to talk to adults in the neurodiversity community. They sometimes (I am sorry to say) have better insight than doctors as to what it feels like. Honestly, most of this sounds well within the normal range of kid behaviour for her age. Kids are born with different temperaments and some kids just are very sensitive. There are different ways the temperament types are defined, but one useful one is 'easy', 'difficult' and 'slow to warm up,' which is also called 'shy.' Your daughter might just be a 'slow to warm up' kid. There is nothing wrong with that and around 15% of kids have this temperament. And if your son has a different temperament, your daughter might be doing things you do not expect, but are just normal for someone with her temperament. \n\nIf your son is 6 or older, he is likely in a different moral development stage than your daughter, which could explain their different reactions to punishment. Also at 4, kids are still very egocentric and do not have fully developed theory of mind, so sometimes struggle to understand that other people do not know everything they know and struggle to understand that other people have other viewpoints. ( \n\nInterests and obsessions are a normal kid thing as well. When I was her age I was really, really into windmills. My niece, who is also 4, is currently really into the Great British Bake Off. Before that she was really into ghosts. But not to a degree that would merit a diagnosis of any kind. \n\nKids at that age may seem like they have a good grasp of language, but they are still learning so much. Literal interpretations and dogmatic definitions are super common. Kids practice assimilation (understanding new things according to what they already know) and accomodation (altering the way they categorise things to include new information.) \n\nAnother big developmental milestone for kids around this age is developing symbolic thought. However, it takes them a lot of time and there is often confusion between what is real and what is not. Magical thinking is super common for little kids. And keeping their inner worlds private (eg. saying no when you asked if she was playing teacher) is super common too. Little kids are just learning that they are separate from other people and sometimes exercising that separateness by being contrary can be fun and empowering for them. Learning to lie is a sign of cognitive development. \n\nIncredibly vivid dreams are also much more common in children than adults and nightmares are most common between 3 and 6. Children's sleep is different from adults' sleep.\n\nYou should talk to a qualified child psychologist if you are worried, and I am just a random psych student on the internet, but it might be worth researching child development psychology too before jumping to diagnose. Kids really are not just small adults. Their brains are developing and going through different stages, which can sometimes seem really weird to us, but actually are a normal part of growing up.\n\nAlso, do not forget we are living in strange times. Things can be stressful for kids right now and they pick up on parental stress too. Do not beat yourself up! I was a lot like this as a child. I recently got an ASD diagnosis, but the psychologist that I went to said that as a child I may not have been diagnosed because I did not have significant developmental delays. \n\nMaybe instead of or in addition to looking for a diagnosis play therapy could be helpful in learning how to manage emotions. What is been helpful for me has been learning to work with my differences instead of trying to change myself. I wish you all the best! The challenge is that I feel like it could also be adhd/social anxiety because those run in the family. The difference is so slim that it is hard to tell! Thank you so much for the advice and support :)", "Question About Being Frustrated with Therapist for Commenting on Me Using Text Chat and Taking Notes During Session  Hello, \n\nThis is my first post here, so please let me know if I put this in the wrong place or have the wrong tag. \n\nI think I experience selective mutism. I have been seeing how I feel with different forms of communication. I find in times of high anxiety (new social situations, dealing with conflict, feeling really emotional,etc), I really benefit from using written communication (which has been made possible with things being virtual) - I feel far less anxious, like actually not anxious at all, and I do not end up ruminating on the conversation as much after.   \n\n\nI see a therapist regularly. He knows I am autistic. I have told him written communication is easier for me, especially during times of distress. I scripted a reflection for today's session because I am going through a lot of different things and have a hard time coming up with what I want to say in the moment right now. I shared my reflection. Then, I started responding to his questions via the message feature (which I have not done this much before, and have been hesitant to do so because I was afraid he would say something or think I am weird). He said he noticed I was using it more and inquired about it. I started to get defensive and felt frustrated. I let him know and changed the subject. We then got to the end of the session and I asked him a follow up question from another session. Instead of answering the question, he made a comment about how I have this pattern of taking notes during session and bringing up things later. He emphasized he was just curious.   \n\n\nThis whole thing made me really mad. He has made comments about me taking notes before and I mentioned how that made me feel uncomfortable. Am I being overly critical? Am I over thinking this? Since that is a recurring situation, I feel like he is trying to make you stop and do thing verbally more often and not take notes, which is not very professional. You are not overreacting, and I would consider changing therapists if I were you (not if everything else is perfect, finding a good therapist is hard) Sadly autistic people getting forced out of their comfort zone is very common. He is not specialised in ASD, is not he? Maybe you could benefit from have a specialised therapist, but I do not know how availaible they are where you live. That is unprofessional of him. I take extensive mental notes during sessions and write and think about my thoughts on them later. Sometimes I go back to topics and the hardest things I have expressed through keeping a symptom journal and through a letter. My therapist has only read throigh them, been empathetic, and gotten me a reservation to go see the psychiatrist. I do not have autism (if I do it is well mixed up with my trauma responses/mild af), and to my knowledge he is not trained to deal with people with autism. Your therapist really does not have an excuse here, maybe bringing it up and letting him know how that makes you feel will get you forward. He wants to know why you take notes and how it helps you. If you cannot answer those questions, you should tell him \"I cannot answer that right now\". \n\nMaybe it would help to bring him a page from the internet or a book about what selective mutism is and symptoms you experience.\n\nright now, he does not understand how you are experiencing SM, how chatting helps you, how you feel when you need to write things down, or why. He cannot help  you without understanding those things. He also does not know if you want to use text communication for the rest of your life, or if your goal is to learn to speak more. He needs to know what your goal is to help you. So he is asking questions to try to understand what is going on so he can help.", "I do not know what to do \nIt is my boyfriend\u2019s birthday and he wants to voice chat, we have voice chatted a couple of times and he wants to voice chat but idk why I am just scared for some reason I want to voice chat with him but idk when he asked my throat just got tight I told him I do not want to cause it will be embarrassing( tho it is just that idk I just cannot talk my throat just will not when I try nothing comes out and I feel horrible for lying to him) he said it might be but it is ok tho but I just do not feel comfortable he said I do not have to if I did not want to or if I did not feel comfortable but for some reason I feel bad I just wish I could give him what he wants cause it is his birthday and we are like miles away I just do not know why I am like this I told him I will think hard about it but for some reason the answer is still no but I do not want to disappoint him as it is his birthday I do not know what I should do? I need help", "I think I may have SM but I am not sure I think I may have SM, but like the title says, I am really not sure. \nI struggle with severe social anxiety (not formally diagnosed, but have spoken with doctors about it). At school, I often find myself feeling physically unable to talk - someone will say something to me, and when I go to reply, I cannot speak properly, I just make a really quiet noise that is not even coherent, or 90% of the time I will just smile/laugh politely if my name is brought up in conversation. I do find I am able to talk if needed though, such as when I am asked a question in class, or when I am talking to certain people (sometimes not even friends, there is just a few people I feel comfortable taking to, not really sure why). Of course, even when I am put in situations where I have to talk, it does not come without anxiety and I often find myself on the verge of a panic attack even after being asked a simple question (this is due to my social anxiety).\n\nHowever this is usually only in a classroom setting - at lunch and break times, I can sit with my friends and I can talk absolutely fine. \n\nI will talk at home absolutely fine. Super rarely there are times I will not talk to my family, usually at dinner times when I am feeling down/anxious and I just cannot bring myself to talk to them, but I am not sure if that is more related to SM or just me feeling down.\n\nI have heard - but this might not be right - that another effect that SM can have is restricting what you feel comfortable talking aloud about, which really resonates with me. There are lots and lots of things that I do not feel comfortable taking about aloud. I also whisper/ talk extremely quietly in public - especially at school when talking to my friends in a classroom setting.\n\nSo, like stated, I am not actually sure if I have SM, so I was looking for some advice I guess. I have done a lot of research on the topic, and sometimes I will read something that will really resonate with me, and make me think that perhaps I do have SM - but on the other hand I feel as though perhaps my symptoms are not quite SM and perhaps just severe social anxiety? Is there such thing as mild selective mutism?", "Question about SM by a parent Hello, \n\nI am really seeking some support. I believe that my 4-year old has SM. He is loud and talkative in the home but in preschool and karate class l he communicates mainly by whispering or nodding his head. He has been in this preschool since Feb 2021. The teacher says that he will respond to her but it typically is a whisper only. He will answer her questions with a nod or a whisper. He seems to really struggle with gaining attention of adults in the classroom. Especially when he needs something. \n\nWhen teachers talk to him (i.e., say hello) he will look at his feet and refuse to answer. The teacher said that he is starting to talk more to his peers but not consistently. He is hyper-compliant in the school setting. In September the teacher said he was not communicating his needs/wants to teachers. So I suggested that he raise his hand to get a teachers attention (I did not know if it was OK to do that, I just desperate to try something), and that seems to have worked a little but it is still a whisper. \n\nI was starting to get concerned so I contacted a therapist and he has an evaluation next week. My thought was that they could at least provide an assessment so we know how to help him (even if the diagnosis is not SM). \n\nHere is what is throwing me off. I told my sister about it and she is completely dismissing me. He does talk very well to her, so she does not see it personally. She basically told me that he just is emotionally immature and that he is just weird. She said that I am blowing it out of proportion. She said that he will be fine and that we just baby him too much which is why he is not talking. My husband is also not being supportive -- he says that my 4-year is just shy and I need to just give it time. \n\nI am feeling lost. Should I cancel the appointment? I do not want to make it worse. I just want to support him and provide him what he needs. TIA. Your sister is wrong. Selective mutism is not from being babied (take it from a 23 year old who worked through college while living in a storage unit as a 16 year old and still has it).\n\nIt can be an issue of anxiety or neurology and it may or may not get better with time. If you want to help the child, you should focus on helping them develop at their own pace. If they need alternative communication methods that is ok (I carry a notepad at all times).\n\nAs for whether or not that will affect their ability to work, it probably will not. I am in a senior position with a college and having purchasing and educational duties (lots of discussion and negotiation). There is always a way around talking.\n\nI discuss any important facts over email (phone/video call is becoming rude). I maintain access to a chat function in calls (we use Teams or Zoom). And, I pre-record educational sessions (which allows them to be preserved and distributed).\n\nYour doctor may recommend something called ABA. Please avoid this. It is a very controversial therapy based on gender conversion therapy, which nearly all people exposed to say was very harmful. Studies indicate it can raise risk for PTSD by as much as 70%. It is not worth it. Thank you for your response and providing your personal experience regarding SM!\n\n I am familiar with ABA and will absolutely not being using this \"therapy.\" The psychologist conducting the evaluation would also be doing the direct therapy with him (she is also a LPC). She described it as play therapy, with consultations, observations, and push-ins with the other environments to develop a plan with him. \n\nThank you again! I was older when I had SM and I do not have any specific advice, but I just wanted to say that the therapy cannot hurt. My own child has been in therapy since a little older than that and giving your kid one more safe person is never a bad thing. At that age, I think it is usually fun for them and if he hates it, you can always change your mind. Whatever the situation turns out to be, you are a good mom for looking out for him. from my understanding, SM is not something that a child will grow out of..like the anxious behaviors just become more ingrained as time goes on. \u200b \u200b\r  \n\u200b\r  \ni remember hearing people say that i was just shy when i was a kid..i was diagnosed with selective mutism at 14. now i am 25 and still struggling with it. when i was 18 i found a therapist that has an understanding of SM and have been working with him on and off over the years and making (slow) progress. \u200b\r  \n\u200b\r  \nso it is great that you have noticed this early on and i think therapy is absolutely a good idea!\u200b\r  \n\u200b\r  \nalso i know you do not have a definite diagnosis yet, but i know people with SM can differ in ways they are comfortable communicating, and i would just want to add that something like hand raising might be uncomfortable as it can draw quite a bit of attention (though maybe your son is fine with it). \u200b\r  \nso just a suggestion for communicating in the classroom: i had a teacher one year who had me leave an index card on my desk. one side was red, the other green. so if i needed help or something, i would flip it to the red side and the teacher would come over so i could ask my question. It never hurts to be early, even if you are wrong. I am turning 19 in exactly 7 days, still fucked.\n\nIn do not think I ever really spoke in pre-school...I only remember playing in the playground that was there, they had these pedal-cars and I loved them. Then Elementary school, I could occasionally read out loud in class (do I physically remember me reading? No, but I am pretty sure I did it, at some point)....and in 5th grade I read my paper (my mom wrote me), in front of the entire class and parents...............\n\nThen in 6th grade I stopped talking like I did back then, but even before middleschool which started then.....I never found a 'need' to say more than necessary...or that is what I thought of it. I had my Aunt as the school nurse, and she was someone I did not talk to.....so where I thought it was just me 'not finding the need to speak much,' it was always there in ways.\n\nI can not recall a time that I properly communicated with my parents or siblings from my head. I do have on video, I made a lot in the year 2011 (when I am 9, I was born this month in 2002).....I did talk to my brother, and in those videos with them near me.........idk I think I really stopped talking to my family in 6th gradeish, so 10 years old. I can talk to my Mom now, and everyone but even to my Mom....it is forced, and I can not ever remember a time I have talked to her or anyone in my life, without some sort of mental restriction. Even to friends (which the best ones I made in 9th grade) I could talk to them in the car, without my parents....since one drove, he was older. I never added much to the conversation or brought my own ideas into it. I talked to them on the Xbox, but I never did in any way like they did....the last time I talked to them on Xbox was about 5 months ago, in June of this year.\n\nThat is about where I am now........when I was \"in love\" with this girl, who has no actual clue of who I am besides one interaction....I saw another side to life, and a side to grow towards, and I made the most progress against SM, I ever have. But that past, and now I reside just pushing people away, I just lock myself in one room, doing the minimal work for college....which has been fully online as of now.............and soon to have classes in person next semester......and as much as I wanted to speak when I was \"in love\".....now I have no desire, and going in person to these classes gives me stress. Will I talk? Probably not, probably maybe..........and then there is that 'what do I do?' moment, idk what would occur, I guess they would think I am stupid or something and go on about, but past that, I just sit there.......and regret my life.\n\nI wish I was not born into where I am now. I came out of the bathroom about 10mins ago, and I am so disconnected, and self-aware of myself....being in my own body, and it just weirds me out........I just want that to stop, not to die......but that 'me being me' to stop.\n\nThat is about it, usually I avoid talking about SM now or going/reading this sub........but every once a few days, weeks, etc......I check in and I will spew like I am now......or do an occasionally \"feel like it will help something\" rant on the discord vent, the SM Discord. So yeah, I keep a log on my life on the day to day, and that is about as exciting as it gets. School or college which I am going to now, I do not like, I do not like 'normal.' It just seems so false, I just picture the forest and being away from everyone.........although is that what I really want? No, when I was \"in love\" I wanted so much more, I actually hoped for more. Now I just hope for nothing. I used to hope for hope, and cry each day...........but now I do not even do that. I just am. I am also a huge contamination germaphobe, so that just makes it worse. Even more trapped then not speaking. I was not always that way, but again I was in senses.....but when I was really young, not really........I was not much of a germaphobe. It sucks.\n\nAnd I write this for me, it is good to jot it down, I will save this to my document I have been keeping when I rant like this now...........But yeah, it is serious. SM is so incomprehensible to the average person, and even the people in the 'know,' it is impossible to understand. At least in the sense of actually being SM, it is so hard to translate when to translate it, you would have to communicate........and you cannot communicate. And SM is not 'shyness,' it is anxiety and it will always be anxiety. You could speak to 1000 people from a stage, and still be unable to speak to your parents. I would speak to 1000 people on a stage before I could speak to my parents, as long as they were not award of me doing it.\n\nNot looking for sympathy either, it is just how it is. This is just the actual perspective. Even other SM people, I do not necessarily  correlate to them directly, it is so expansive.............and I am sorry this is about a lot of words. That is all I have to write now.\n\nAnd when I do write that log, I do not tell all in my daily writing, I write it especially now like someone else is going to be reading it soon. What does that spell for me? idk.........I do not like suicide though, I feel like it is not a good solution. It is just a big unknown, if I knew it meant I would get another life, then maybe I would actually think about it..........and I have, but now I just do not think anything good of it........not that life is good, but dying I do not find to be better, if anything it is worse. I could just be stuck as me, but dead.\n\nEdit: I do not think there is any good way to help SM, I think the only way is to find someone who actually understands SM, that is the most important thing in my book. My Mom/Dad are fully aware of my SM, and even see a 'specialist' that is regarded about me......to \"try to help,\" but any progress that had been made, was made when I was again \"in love,\" the only time I was motivated to want change or to see an 'end goal' in life........I hold the belief my Mom and Dad, know zero about what SM is, they have no understanding of it........and this 'specialist's' understanding, I doubt. And this is exactly how I write in my log....so uh, sorry if it is very horrible scramble thought.\n\nThere is a lot more to my own SM, and I think that is why I find it hard to even relate to most people here entirely. There was only 1 other person here I felt like I really could relate to, but that is it. I never used alternate communication, and I would never want to. I nodded, that is it. Strangers are best, for me.....although it is still uncomfortable, and that self-awareness I go back to that, it is like I cannot even talk if I am aware of it. I wish there were better describing words because most of the time I feel like no good word is there to express anything of this. This will be the last I edit. Wow, what they said to you is so dismissive to such a life altering issue. It is so much more than just anxiety and it definitely does not come from being babied. Kids want to talk and laugh and play and when they are dead silent like this then that means theirs an issue going on at home or mentally. \n\nThis disorder completely handicapped my life for years. Please do not take their advice seriously and you should definitely go through with the appointment. I never got therapy for it so I cannot speak to the effectiveness of it, but I would say please at least be cognizant about what he is going through. At least he can whisper and that is a good start. I could not do that until I was 16 Your sister is wrong, do not cancel the appt. I was basically like your son in kindergarten, in early elementary school, my teachers thought I could not read and was evaluated separately from my peers. \n\nI never got help, though I did mostly outgrow it, I still struggle with social anxiety. I am quiet as an adult and am avoidant of talking to a lot of people, even if I need help. Please do not cancel the appointment. My SM was passed off in kindergarten too, and it slowly worsened throughout the years until I was barely able to communicate at all, even nonverbally to anyone, and was starting to go mute around even my parents. I finally got treatment at age 14. It took a while to recover because I was older. SM will not go away on its own. Please keep the appointment. It cannot hurt to just make sure he does not have it. But it can hurt if he has it and does not get help. Definitely dont cancel the appointment because first of all better safe than sorry especially when it can get SO much worse (speaking from experience) just make sure people know not to push him if they do it can make it harder for him because what sm essentially is is a freeze response to anxiety,stress, being overwhelmed so forcing him to talk will increase those feelings making it harder to talk if you treat it early on he will do great so dont worry", "I need dating advice. We are both socially awkward. Last Saturday I went on (what I am considering) my first date. I messaged my date beforehand telling him I had SM and was by no means as charming IRL as I was over message. He said that was fine, then mentioned thinking that he may have undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome.\n\nThis is the point I am caught off guard.\n\nIronically, I doubted he would be that socially awkward, since he seemed pretty normal over text (hindsight 20/20). I get there and soon find out I am not the only person in the room with severe social ineptitude\n\nThe date lasted around 2 hours, 60%, if not more was awkward silence. I do not think we even made eye contact once. The conversation we did end up having during this time went pretty well I think, and we both had a good time despite it being uncomfortable. We think that we just need to spend more time together to get used to being around each other.\n\nAnyways, I would like some advice or tips on how to achieve that level of normal social functioning between us. Text each other in person. Eye contact is hard for people on the spectrum so I am not surprised by the lack of eye contact between you both. Plan dates that does not have you both eating in front of each other. I recommend no pressure dates like walking around and getting a drink/dessert to go. Conversations can be made from just what you see while walking. Plan an activity that you both can enjoy.. some ideas are arcades, archery, museums, amusement parks, biking, bowling, beach, zoo etc. And just talk to him as if he is your friend.. imagine you are talking to a friend. Casual. Ask him questions like what are his hobbies, if he is watching any good shows rn, how was quarantine etc or share music. Good luck! I have found one of the most effective conversation strategies for me is: Chris Voss's Tactical Empathy. The two I use the most are \"mirroring\" and \"labeling.\" \n\nMirroring is simply repeating the last word or words someone says with no judgement but with a sense of curiosity - i.e. make it sound like a question. \n\nQuick eexample:\n\nHim: I had a crazy day at work today. \n\nYou: A crazy day? (always insert a slight pause)\n\nHim: Yeah, my boss is trying to get me to work with someone I  do not get along with. \n\nYou: Someone you do not get along with? (pause)\n\nHim: Yeah, her name's Carol. God, she is always eating chili. I mean, who eats that much chili? \n\nYou: Chili?\n\nHim: Yes! Like the meat and bean kind of chili. \n\nLabeling is when you label the way you think someone is feeling.\n\nYou: It sounds like she is driving you crazy. \n\nHim: She is! Sometimes she will be talking with a mouthful of chili and will put another spoonful's worth in. \n\nYou: Another spoonful's worth? \n\nHim: Yes! I am going to record it on my phone. Then you will see. \n\nYou: (Labeling) It sounds like you want to prove it to me. \n\nSooooooo ... that is an example of what I am talking about. But I do use it a good bit as it makes people clarify their position on a topic and it gives me a read on their emotions. You should look him up (chris voss). He is going to have better examples than what I have given. \n\nFinally, and I do need to say this, if you find that he is always just talking about himself and never reciprocating (for example, if he never asks if you like chili) then he may be just dumping his woes on you. Do not get suck being someone fair weather girlfriend.  \n\nHope this helps. This here is one strategy I teach to my students on the spectrum, though I call it replicate (mirroring) - predict (labeling)  - intel (sharings, or when you share your own opinions or knowledge, or seek to aquire knowledge, on something you are talking about or a related topic). If he never is not reciprocating, intel/share is your opportunity to say, \"I like chili, but only if it is spicy. Do you like spicy food?\" or \"That would drive me crazy, too! I had a friend that would always talk with her mouth full and it drove me crazy!\" . Yeah, I have been wanting to take him to the zoo (he likes animals) but then I remember it is 120 degrees (F) outside, lol. I am thinking something activity based would be good as well, just not anything outside. I play Clash Royale with my boyfriend as we sit together. We often do it at dinner out to eat and the servers act a lite weird about it but they can mind their business! \n\nHaving an activity in your own bubble but still \"together\" can be intimate in its own way and i enjoy it more than direct face to face talking. This sounds like a fun idea, I will keep it in mind. :) &gt;Do not get suck being someone fair weather girlfriend.\n\nWill not have to worry about that, seeing as we are both guys, lol.\n\nOn a serious note, I will look into this method. Even though it is more of the speaking part that hard for me (as opposed to the science of conversation) it might help anyway.  My boyfriend was taught to talk like that, but I have trouble with it, because to me it sounds like he is just parroting me, and I have trouble with repeating myself...\n\nJust started therapy and this was one of the topics I brought up as wanting to work on", "I wrote a poem out of frustration because I embarrassed myself last night AGAIN (was diagnosed a couple weeks ago) happy I found this sub tho ", "How can I know if is SM or poor self-esteem the reason for not speak up? ", "Help needed with SM Character in book I am writing a book where one of the characters has selective mutism. I personally do not know anyone with selective mutism and I really want to write this character well. I would appreciate any tips, anecdotes, 'dos and do nots', ANYTHING to help me create a fully developed character that people with SM will actually relate to. I know that it manifests differently for each person but the more information and experiences I have the better! for me, the thing with selective mutism is that it goes past just talking. little things like how i cannot say the word hello to anyone, not even people i am comfortable with, so i have to say good morning or something else. this happens with a lot of words, like thank you and goodbye for me. It also never makes sense, sometimes i will be perfectly happy, then all of a sudden i cannot talk for no reason. some subjects are also harder, like i cannot talk about emotions to any adult at all. also, 70% of kids with sm have some form of sensory issue, noises being too loud or lights too bright etc. if you have any questions, feel free to ask me!! i am an aspiring author myself, and would happily answer anything as best as i can. question, how big of a role does the SM character play in the story? how you write them will certainly depend on the perspective they are viewed from. asking some basic questions too can help set a structure for the character: for example, *how old are they?* many people with SM are said to \"grow out\" of it in adulthood, but really we just get better at managing our anxiety. *how severe is their SM?* mine used to be so severe to the point where i could not even smile to people outside my immediate family; meanwhile, some people only have SM in very rare situations.\n\nSM is not necessarily caused by trauma as some people think. your brain basically just decides that not talking is the best coping mechanism for highly stressful social situations. there can be other underlying causes too: being self-conscious of your voice, constantly receiving negative feedback when talking in the past, or having a genetic predisposition to anxiety/SM.\n\nanother thing is that a lot of people with SM are also autistic/neurodivergent, or share very similar experiences when it comes to socializing issues, so researching those can help.\n\ndos &amp; donts:\n- do not imply that they are choosing to stay silent. the anxiety that causes SM basically shuts down the \"words in brain\" to \"speech out mouth\" bridge, and it is so, so frustrating. most SM sufferers *want* to talk badly.\n- do not define the character solely by their SM. give them interests that they would ramble on about for hours to a trusted friend. write them with as much depth as you would any other character.\n- in a very speech-centric society, the effects of SM seep into one's daily life and personality. do explore how your character navigates &amp; communicates with the world around them.\n\n\nwhoop, this was way longer than i meant it to be, guess i got excited since i am also a writer (who happens to love character studies haha) **tldr; do a lot of research and ask yourself lot of questions.** i would be happy to help answer any other questions you might have! :) Ah! Thank you for all this info! Hes one of the main characters,  and he is about 8 or 9 yrs old. His character is very wise though, hes definitely an old soul, and you get perspectives of him from other characters and from his own thoughts. Thank you, seriously,  for all this! I really want him to be represented correctly! Thank you for sharing! I really appreciate your perspective, I want this character to be well written so it means a lot! really glad i could be of help! he sounds like a wonderful character so far (the old soul thing is actually quite fitting\u2014kids with SM often spend a lot of time talking internally to themselves, lost in their own mindscapes), wishing you good luck with this story! :D anytime! thank you so much for including a character with sm, the representation means a lot to us! I definitely have a milder case. It mostly shows up with just certain topics that have patterns in social situations. Confrontation is a big one, I just go mute and dissociate a bit, hoping to get out of there, no matter if it was just, if it was my fault or not. This entire thing with confrontation goes deeper, it has implications like I cannot verbally express needs and wants, which makes me want to be very independent and never have to ask anything of anyone ever. It is a much bigger deal if I ask someone to spend their own money for me, even if it is my parent and I am underage than if I just buy what I want for myself with my own income. So whatever the trigger(s) of anxiety is/are for your character, think of the deeper implications.\n\n I found it very useful to tap into the mute and deaf spaces to get coping skills, because I retain a good bit of movement control even in the most stressful situations. So I learned sign language, I taught sign language to my closest friend group during the good times when I could talk, so that when I cannot, I can communicate to them that I am okay, so they will not worry, or whatever I need them to note in the situation, still participate in the conversation. Writing is another good one. Some people completely freeze up, writing and signing would not be good options for them, they could like prewritten notes or not communicating and just doing, a lot better. So think about what ways your character feels the most natural to cope.\n\nAnxiety can be so constant that it becomes subconscious. Thoughts might not race, conscious mind might be completely calm and under control, but the body is mute and feels like you are going to puke or you get a headache because you realize you have been tensing up your shoulder muscles for the last few hours... or days.\n\nThe other traits and mental illness you character has also affect each other. Someone who has autism and SM is going to communicate and interpret other people's communication towards them differently from someone who has CPTSD and SM. (I am the latter of these two btw.) SM rarely if never travels alone, the other thing can be a phobia, panic disorder, GAD, PTSD, depression, anything ever that will make your brain work differently.\n\nPeople with SM come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. From introverts, who have a really close couple friends and spend less than a day of time each week with them and the rest alone because they get socially exhausted as much as they enjoy their company, to extroverts, who can have huge circles of friends and be as social as ever, even though they might not always talk, but communicate in a bunch of alternate ways, to ambiverts somewhere in between, even compensating for the energy level of the people they are with: a quiet company will encourage them to talk and communicate more as a louder one can leave them to be more of a listener with only a couple inputs to the conversation. Think about how this affects your character. Do they seek to calm themselves down in a quiet place, alone, vanishing to places like the bathroom when they need to, or do they like busy company to distract them from the scary stuff?\n\nAsk questions, do your research. You have started in a really good place by coming here.", "Can a person outgrow selective mutism on their own? ", "Is it possible to force yourself I remember a few times where I am able to speak, though I was a crying mess and barely audible. Has anyone ever tried forcing it until they no longer have sm? If so, can you elaborate your experience? SM does not entirely go away, but it is possible to conceal it with years of exposure therapy and training. I would not try to do too much at once, as it can wipe you out for months.\n\nWhat I have been doing as exposure therapy is to partake in Discord voice calls and speak as much as I feel comfortable with. I have gotten more comfortable with speaking for long periods of time, and my real voice has started to resemble the one I think in. I have been at this for about two months, and it is helped my self-esteem a lot. I am not saying it will work for everyone, as it is just something I decided to try in February one day, but I think it is worth a try if you want to practice without the stress of having to simultaneously focus on your physical presence and things like eye contact.\n\nIf you want to try just keeping your mic unmuted at first, I joined a Selective Mutism server I think is a good place to start. Needless to say, barely anyone uses their mic, but it is a good place for messaging others with SM.\n\n(", "My 6 year old son has been diagnosed with SM. I would love any advice or tips, maybe something that helped you, or would have helped your younger self. I want to do all I can to help and support him to live as comfortably as he can inside his own mind. Thank you so much. I have a lot to learn about this, we only just found out. I suffer with anxiety and depression so have at least a small appreciation of the complexity. I just want to be a good dad and support my boy. Reddit is an incredible place and I would love to hear anything you guys have to say. Thank you so much. I think if my parents had explained everything about SM to me when I was younger it would have helped. I really did not know why I could not speak and it was just quite confusing not knowing why. \nIf you live in the UK then CAHMS waiting lists can be very long so it is best to get referred early. The best thing for him is probably to treat it early as it is so much harder to speak when you have not for a long time. \nSpeak to his teachers so they do not ever pressure him to speak when he is not comfortable because it definitely will not help. \nI do not know if other people find this but if my parents had told me that they do not expect me to tell them when I start speaking, then it would be a lot easier to start because people with sm are often scared of others reaction if they start speaking because most of the time they do not like being the center of attention. I would have him carry around a notebook for communication or even just to record his thoughts, since I have had countless experiences with giving up on telling people my thoughts simply because I assumed no one would want to hear the opinions of the girl who does not speak. The notebook could serve as an outlet for any thoughts he wants to feel proud about without having to ever share them. A plain notebook with a lock would be best, since people being pushy will almost always make someone with SM regress. If it looks uninteresting enough, classmates might be less likely to snoop.\n\nAnother thing I would keep in mind is that SM never really goes away. It can be suppressed with enough practice, though too much can also cause a burnout and regression. It is very rare, so I have not seen a \"main\" way to handle it, but I will say that my own experience with it is that too much therapy would\u2014 and still does\u2014 increase my stress levels and makes me want to isolate myself longer based on the amount of time I spend even being near other people.\n\nI still have a lot of relapses and a long way to go until I can function as an independent adult, but the thing that will never change is that there is always hope for improvement and plenty of people online who are more than willing to help. I will try to dig up an essay I wrote a few years after I began speaking at school if you would like to hear about how it felt. The feelings cannot be conveyed entirely, as it is a concept that I have found only selectively mute can fathom, but partial knowledge of the level of anxiety can greatly improve any interactions one has with someone who has SM. It took me wanting to change as a teen to make a lot of progress, immediately preceding that I was forcibly befriended by my first kitty and then a schoolmate at a brand new school.\n\nAs an adult I have had the opportunity to help other people and animals come out of their shells and I would say building confidence through fun activities is a huge part of it.\n\nI did not have outside help working on this. I badly wanted to work and I knew it was a problem. My high school was teeny tiny with legit 0 tolerance for bullying, so I got to know everyone and was friendly with everyone by the time I graduated. That small and safe environment did help me a ton in learning to socialize. Then I worked in the service industry where your whole job is talking to strangers because I was terrified of being held back from future opportunities and I lucked out at one of those jobs with a mentor who taught me everything. Hi There,\n\nThank you for reaching out because I was in the same place as you were a couple years ago.  I have a 7 year old daughter with SM.  She has made such progress over the past few years from not being able to speak in front of people at all and not completing work in school, to someone that talks to a few close friends, reads to her teacher, completes all her work and is genuinely a happy kid.\n\nI would definitely bring the school into the fold and get him an IEP.  My daughter gets multiple counselling sessions in school in a group and individual settings.  I would also speak to the teacher and come up with strategies that will help him.  My daughter has an outside therapist as well who strategies with the school.  \n\nI have learned to be patient and not put any stress on her.  We have seen solid and steady improvement which is rewarding.  \n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions from a parents point of view or need any ideas. Wow, this is powerful. I think I can imagine that. My first thought today was 'i need to explain this to him' so he can be part of the treatment and understand what is going on. \n\nThank you so much. Thank you very much indeed for your reply. Partial knowledge of those feelings would be immensely appreciated, as are your other comments. It is strange, the people we spoke to monitored him at school and said he frequently \"clams up\". However we can hardly shut him up at home (not that we try to!). However we are noticing he is quick to become emotional, demands structure and repetition. We tried helping him put a pair of gloves on last week and after 10 minutes of trying he got very emotional and upset, like he just did not understand how or why he was struggling. I do not know if that is part of SM or a knock on or something else, or just being 6. \n\nIf you do find the essay and are happy to share it I would send a big digital high five of thanks. i feel like i would be in a lot better of a place now if i would began learning sign language at that age This is fantastic, I am so pleased to hear of the positive journey for your daughter, thanks so much for replying. We had a call with his school today and they have a long list of strategies that they would like us all to work on together, so a great start. It is a lovely small school and he loves it there, so we are on a good step to start. I will have to look up what an IEP is. I shall definitely do as you do, and work hard to ensure zero stress on him. I would love to take you up on your kind offer of dm'ing once we get our heads together on the plans, would be really handy to know what doe/does not work for you.\n\nThanks again. Thanks so much for your reply, I really appreciate this. Props to you for working through the issues to achieve great things. Sounds like you had to step way out of comfort zones and it really paid off for you, this is great to know thank you. Hi there, just like your son, I was diagnosed with SM at a young age. Because I was enrolled in a small private school, it was a bit easier for my parents to communicate with teachers about my situation. One of the most thoughtful things that I remember is that I exchanged a notebook with my first grade teacher each week, and we would write and draw about whatever came into mind. It was such a gentle yet creative way to get me comfortable to communicate, and I eventually felt comfortable enough to whisper to her. If I were a parent, I would obviously allow things to happen naturally, even if it takes some time. I felt rushed in a way because I was threatened to be held back. I took some speech therapy, but I am not quite sure of whether it helped or hurt me. All I really would like to say is that there is a lot of patience needed for this. I would also recommend keeping some teachers in check, since I had a couple humiliating/traumatic instances where teachers tried coaxing me to talk in front of the entire class. My parents did not really think much of it, but it was very hurtful to me. I am able to talk in any circumstance with anybody now, but I am socially anxious still. Just be there for your son, be patient, and accept him. He will eventually feel comfortable enough to speak. Found it! (I think I was in tenth or eleventh grade when I wrote this, so my tone is rather casual and accusatory for an essay, and it has a few typos.)\n\n**Why I Do not Talk Much**\n\n\u3000**I have too much to say, yet it takes a slow build-up of courage for me to utter** ***one*** **thing. I tend to let others initiate conversations, but I am still rather hesitant to respond.**\n\n\u3000**I have Selective Mutism (SM). It is an anxiety-based disorder that prevents one from speaking during specific\u2014 if not all\u2014 social settings. Though it was more severe up \u2019til eighth grade, I still have the habit of keeping to myself.**\n\n\u3000**The reason I** ***can*** **speak is because I would made a flippant promise to my mom when I was in elementary school. I told her, \u201cI will talk to people when I am twelve.\u201d Of course, this was an attempt to get people to stop pressuring me to try, and I figured I had all the time in the world, since eighth graders looked like Titans, compared to us younger students.**\n\n\u3000**Time had run out, though, so it was time to ask myself if I wanted to do anything about my problem. School assignments felt like they were rigged against me, since oral presentation is a big percent of final grades, and even** ***games*** **were unfair. There was this one time I was playing Uno with some classmates, and they imposed the \u201cgot to say \u2018Uno,\u2019 or you draw two cards\u201d rule.**\n\n\u3000**I was not able to** **argue, so I kept playing, because the opportunity to play Uno does not come up very often; y\u2019know?**\n\n\u3000**To shorten the story a bit\u2014 not that it will do much\u2014 I created a pretend-ultimatum. \u201cIf you do not speak now, you will never be able to.\u201d Now, in** ***no*** **way is that true, but it worked. I raised my hand, and answered a question during my seventh grade orientation. My heart was beating so hard, it might as well have been a battering ram trying to crack my ribs. It physically hurt to talk.**\n\n\u3000**Despite this first step, I still barely spoke during that year. It would not be until eighth grade that I would be more used to communicating. I can easily say, though, that I have not felt more fear than right before I first started speaking; not even the time my house almost caught fire. That is how intense the fear is, when you have got SM.**\n\n\u3000**I would say \u201cfeel free to stop me in the hallway to ask questions about SM,\u201d but do not actually do that; I would be too put-on-the-spot to respond. Also, if I talk for too long, I find myself starting to tremble, and it makes it even more difficult to speak.** A big part of my SM consisted of months to even years of preparation and over-analysing situations and behaviours to make sure things go according to plan. If one thing went wrong, I would abort the mission and spend more months in recoil from my failure. To this day, perfectionism is something I struggle with, and I found out I have a tendency to self-sabotage in order to feel like I am in control. What a great idea, I am already thinking of non verbal ways to help, this is an excellent suggestion Alot of what helps me, and helped when I was younger too, is making it known you are willing to wait. \n\nWhether it is longterm or short term, having him know you are not going to be upset or pressuring him to speak is a huge thing.\n\nIt may just be because I am autistic, but also not having to do eye contact. Whether it is you looking at him or the other way around, teaching him that it is okay to look at someone is forehead or their ear etc instead.\n\nAlso making sure that he has ways to communicate otherwise. There may be an issue where at some point he is very attached to the non-speaking way of communication but for now he needs that support available constantly I would assume. \n\nI have an AAC but a notepad, a white board, or the app Cardzilla may be options best for him.\n\nEdit: Oh! And maybe have him try out fidget or stim toys? They help many including myself to calm anxiety a bit. Hello! I am an adult now but some of this I do now to help are raise my hand before I speak so when someone says my name I know for sure it is ok to say what I want. And also, this is anxiety based. So anything that helped reduce anxiety can help us feel more comfortable. For me I like best when my husband gives me a hug and says it is ok. Then I know he understands that It is not that I do not want to talk, it is that I cannot in that moment Oh my goodness, what struggle. Thanks so much for sharing this, it gives me a really clear feel for one avenue of where SM can take you. Thanks so much for hunting and sharing this, a haunting account,I am sorry you suffered so severely in silence. For what it is worth, you come across as a confident, personable and interesting communicator.  I have really appreciated your thoughts which will no doubt allow me to better understand and help my son. thank you. This is so helpful thank you so much! Fortunately his school is small and supportive, i feel confident they will work with us to support him. I loved your point about keeping some teachers in check. I can fully appreciate the negative impact those experiences had. Great to hear you are now able to communicate. I hope your social anxiety does not hinder your enjoyment of life too much. Thanks again. I will do my best to be there for my son. This is such lovely wisdom; removing the pressure short and long term and telling him that from the outset. I can feel the positive reverberation from doing this even now. Great point on the eye contact too. Thank you so much for your advice. Wonderful advice. I am going to work on more cuddles and more ressurance, particularly spontaneously. Thank you kind stranger :) My 6 year old son has SM too. Something that I have been taught is to find ways to help him build confidence in any tasks he does. Also teach him to write words like \u2018help\u2019, \u2018bathroom\u2019, \u2018hurt\u2019, \u2018hungry\u2019, etc... for his teachers and classmates. It will help him feel like he has a voice. Sign language can help too. The whole point is to give him ways to feel like he can communicate in his own way. Finally try to remember that if you have ruled out any developmental conditions then it is more likely a comfort issue paired with anxiety. His teachers need to know the best ways to help him feel safe in his environment. Once that is established he can learn to speak to others. Even if it is just a friend at first. \n\nI am still figuring this all out too. It is been a challenge for sure. I feel your frustration and desire to help him as best you can. I am also a teacher with a specialist in special education and even I cannot always help him like I wish I could! Good luck!! \n\nSomething else to consider: I have taught high school for 19 years. I have yet to meet a student that is unable to speak. Even if it is quietly and just to me. He will get there. My 7 year old was diagnosed when he was 4. We have done a LOT of research into SM over the last 3 years and follow the new papers pretty closely. \n\nOne of the important distinctions within the research that we have found is that it is too simple to label it as anxiety, it is actually moreso a fear response. The amygdala in the brain in kids and adults with SM grows at a much faster pace. This is the fear centre of the brain. So it is like his automatic reaction is fear. That has been really helpful as we have patented over the last 3 years. To remember that the initial response is fear based specifically. \n\nGentle nudges, growing his comfort zone and giving him plenty of space to decompress is key. It is automatic quiet time with books for 20 minutes after school. We have chosen to stay away from tablets and screens at school because we noticed he was attaching to them very strongly. This you will have to make the call for on your own son, but we did not want it to become a crutch that early. If he chooses differently as he gets older, that will be up to him. \n\nLike someone else mentioned, giving him time to answer is really important. If there is pressure, there is a fear of getting something wrong which means there is a higher chance of him clamming up.  \n\nThis fear also plays into perfectionism. Creative tasks are difficult, and we think it is because there is no black or white approaches. He is told us that he is afraid of getting it \"wrong\" (art class at school is fun sometimes haha!) and so we see he does not naturally try. We have introduced family painting time, etc with just all the supplies on the table and everyone doing their own thing to get him used to it. No expectations, just growing thr comfort zone. This approach tends to work well because there is no fear involved. The old school Magic School Bus show on Netflix really helps to- Miss Frizzel is all about making mistakes ;) \n\nI could go on forever, we have learned so much over 3 years and he is made huge growth. Super talkative jn school, first to raise his hand, doing well in a team sport environment, learning how to have a conversation and saying hello to the cashier at the supermarket! \n\nYou have got a great head on your shoulders and always here if you need help. Feel free to DM. You have got this. Hi! \nI have found this book really helpful for when my son was diagnosed this past year:\nOvercoming Selective Mutism by Kotrba and Saffer\n\nMessage me if you ever want to. Our son is 5 and we have found a few things helpful already since his diagnosis this past November! Awesome thanks so much   Thank you so much, this is immensely helpful. It is so strange, he is so talkative most of the time. He was a very late talker though and needed speech therapy. I guess we (at home) do not see this clamming up issue as much as the staff at the school do.\n\nI really appreciate your suggestions, we will put those in to practice. Thanks also for your note of never seeing a non talker through your career. +1 to not making a big deal out of making progress! I was selectively mute for 9 years as a child and the last one or two years were just because I did not want to \"break character\" and attract a bunch of attention, even if positive. I ended up doing it on the first day of school after summer break to help soften the blow, and pretended like it was the most normal thing in the world.", "I am (21F) not sure if this would be considered selective mutism? (Trauma after rape) Hi there. I am just wondering if this would be considered selective mutism! \n\nLast year February I was raped. Fast forward to about August last year, I met my boyfriend. \n\nWhenever we argue, have a disagreement or I have upset him, I literally for the life of me cannot speak. It is like words are completely unable to come out of my mouth, it feels completely impossible. All I can do is either type on my phone to communicate or shake my head. \n\nI am wondering if this is linked to my traumatic event as when it happened, the guy was upset, angry, etc. and was falling down to me a lot, I could not leave and I could not say anything to defend myself at the time. It felt almost like he took away my ability to speak.\n\nIf anyone has any answers or anything similar, please let me know! Yes it would likely be related. It sounds like you fell into a freeze response during your initial assault and this has made an angry or upset man to be a trigger for you, if it was not already. It seems like selective mutism may have already been present to an extent during and possibly before the assault, but it could certainly have been exacerbated by a traumatic event like that. That makes perfect sense. I was just wondering if I was going crazy or trying to find an excuse. Thank you! Sorry about that and ya it seems related but still get professional help if you can. Yes of course. Thank you! Yes it would be considered selective mutism as a symptom and coping mechanism, which is co-indicated with anxiety and stress. The traumatic event is a significant factor that causes anxiety and stress. I understand. Thank you so much! I am sorry, you deserved love and not to be hurt.\n\nPlease read **Speak** by Laurie Halse Anderson:\n Mutism can definitely develop as part of PTSD. It is not technically selective mutism as that diagnosis actually required there not be a history of trauma. However, that does not mean you cannot find help and solace here among people who get the struggle of wanting to speak but not being able to. There is not all that many places online to talk about the struggle of mutism, so please feel welcome.\n\nSomething to keep in mind though is that the treatments for PTSD mutism and selective mutism can be quite different and need to match the condition to be helpful (and in worst cases not actively harmful.) So, please be careful with advice your read here that is specific to selective mutism (which is an anxiety condition not a trauma related one.) Things like exposure therapy might not actually be helpful for you right now the way they could be for someone with SM. I would hate for you to be hurt any more than you already have been. \n\nIf you can get professional help, I really recommend it. had to read that in middle school, it was hard. Not sure. Maybe.  It sounds like some kind of PTSD\nOnly a psychiatrist would know. \nit is very sad and disgusting things like rape happens all the time. This is the correct information. Traumatic mutism is different than selective mutism and treatment is different as well. \n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. I hope that you are able to get some relief and help from the right treating professional.", "question/discussion open to anyone who might know! i am an 18 year old girl who never really had issues speaking in public. in fact i did theater, choir, and wanted to be a lawyer when i grew up all the way through freshmen year. freshmen year i became severely depressed, and by begging of sophomore year i had to drop out of school because of social anxiety/agoraphobia. i have not left the house without a parent or close person since then, but up until mid december i was still speaking fine. on december 15th, i joined a partial hospitalization program and although i was scared to be away from home by myself for the first time in over a year and a half, i managed to be pretty social and active until the  second day. the second day i had a panic attack and found afterwards that i could not speak. this has happened to me before in very short bursts and i always attributed it to my depression, so i was not worried. however on the third day and onward i was completely unable to speak. i could communicate through my phone, but not verbally. i figured this was just some strange agoraphobia symptom, but as i finished the 10 day program the problem persisted. i have contacted several psychiatrists as well as talk to the hospital staff about my issue but they all seem baffled. i suppose that is my question, is it possible this is selective mutism? i have all the symptoms from the limited information i have found on the web, the issue is that i am not a child. can selective mutism be onset later in life? does anyone have any experience or know anyone with muteness issues that manifested after childhood? to clarify from my research and what i understand it is not elective mutism, as i am not choosing not to speak, i am physically unable too. sometimes i can choke out a word or two to a stranger but it takes a lot of energy and it is very jarring to do so, and outside of that speech is limited to two close friends and my immediate family. sorry this is a long read, but please if you have any thoughts or info let me know because i am lost as to what\nto do. thanks so much :) (Sorry for incorrect English, it is not my first language)\n\nSadly, we are not in a position to diagnose your mutism, but it sounds like that to me.\n\nI suppose you are still normal/ more active when at home and around loved ones? Then that could very be mutism.\n\nI had mutism basically since ever, but eventually managed to beat it. Took a lot of therapy and slowly and steadily reaching out of my comfort zone.\n\nThe problem with this is getting started. What I could recommend would be searching for a new hobby, where you can interact with people. I discovered bouldering on my own, went out of my comfort zone and went alone. Asking people in the gym for help. \n\nIf you feel like you cannot do that, due to anxiety or agoraphobia, try something with a family member or close friend and try meeting new people. Having some sort of anchor in those situations always helped me. \n\nAnd consider going to therapy, it helped me a lot in my early years, since I learned to stand up for myself and be more confident in my abilities. \n\nWhat helped me was realizing that they will not hurt me if I spoke to them. I was usually afraid of people, but once I realized that most of them are actually very nice, the problems lessened.", "Is this early signs of selective mutism? Basically, I have been seeing early signs of selective mutism in me. I am not self-diagnosing, but I am pretty sure I have it and I need help finding out if I have it.\n\nI can talk in most situations if I feel comfortable, but if I am really really stressed out and anxious I feel like I cannot talk, feels like there is a lock pad on my throat. And I try so hard to talk, but I cannot. It is just way too hard too. My family nor close friends have not noticed and just thinks I am ignoring them.\n\nI can make a few sounds besides words, it really depends on how I am feeling. \n\nI have not experienced SM symptoms until 1 in a half months ago.\n\nSometimes I cannot talk when I am not anxious but that only occurs if I was mute because of anxiety, and then something triggered my happiness, but it will not go away the second I am non-anxious. It takes me a few minutes to warm up, the maximum is probably half an hour.\n\nI am not sure what triggered me to have SM symptoms, it is probably due to social anxiety or just anxiety alone, or the fact that I feel like/have been shamed for saying ridiculous things\n\nIs this or not?", "What Causes SM? I am 39 and I am pretty sure I have SM. I have never been diagnosed with it, though I was diagnosed with AvPD, bipolar type 3, and OCD. I am probably borderline too.\n\nI do not think I really had crippling social inhibitions until middle school from what I remember. From what I am reading they say it is a genetic propensity for anxiety. I guess I could fit that description. I was horrible at little league baseball cuz I was always afraid of getting hit with the ball. I was petrified of the pitcher's ball.  But generally I think I did not really have anything like SM until middle school, and that was from getting bullied at school, I think. And now here I am at 39 still dealing with it. \n\nI suppose it also has to do with my relationship with my parents which is what I was told when they said I was AvPD. Mom used to go bonkers for no reason, call dad to come home from work and punch me in the head repeatedly, and make me sleep outside in the Winter for example, and I mean days so cold my spit froze before hitting the ground.\n\nI only come on here, cuz I am stuck in this fucked up other country where I cannot really get professional mental health services", "An old anecdote In my last year of high school, I had one of those teachers who makes you fill out a form about yourself. One of the questions was \"Is there anything I should know about you?\" So, I was like, \"Medical conditions, right? That kind of stuff? Well, I have never told a teacher before, but maybe this will be helpful in some way!\" So I wrote, \"I have selective mutism.\" \n\nWell, she looks over the forms right then and there at her desk, and when she gets to mine, she looks at me where I am sitting and asks in disbelief, with the whole class listening, \"Selective Mutism? What does this mean? You are selectively ... mute?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"...Yes.\" Though what I wanted to say was, \"Why the heck would you do that?!\" And the subject was never brought up again. Luckily, I only had that class for one semester.\n\nIt is a bit funny it retrospect. I am sure many of you have similar stories. A teacher did similar to me, first day at a new school, she already knew about my sm and was told not to put me in the situation of having to speak in front of the whole class unless I volunteered myself to do so, she asked me stand up in front of the whole class(literally my worst nightmare) and says \u2018so you have selective mutism right? Do you want to explain to everyone what that is because I do not think most of the class will have heard of it\u2019. I had her for the next 5 years, she never got any better. That is why I hate using the term selective mutism. It makes it seem like it is our choice, like we want to be mute, rather than just something that happens to us or a way we conserve energy or whatever. It implies intent and gives room for moral questioning/judgement I do not know where you are from, but if you are from the US you may actually have grounds to sue based on that interaction. Sounds crazy, but teachers are prohibited by law to disclose students' medical info to unauthorized persons, including classmates. She just broke the law in front of your entire class by disclosing your condition. This is especially critical if you have anything like an IEP or a 504 plan; it would be on record that you have those conditions. You may want to read up on local laws wherever you are to be sure, but I am fairly certain its a federal law. I am from the uk and I think there is something similar here, but it was 5 years ago(although similar things happened throughout my whole 5 years at that school) and I left last year, so I have kind of put it behind me now and I do not want to have to go through the whole legal process That is understandable. Still, you should read up on the law regarding discrimination based on your condition over there. I know there are things like time limitations on how long you can sue over here, depending on the crime, of course. But there may be people you come across later in life, like in workplaces, who will give you grief about it on purpose. It always helps to be informed ahead of time. Thank you yeah I will probably have a look, I am pretty used to people just not understanding now, I can just never tell if it is deliberate or they just genuinely do not understand why I cannot talk sometimes Not selectively mute, but I have eyes like a fish, I cannot read anything that is more than half a foot away from my face. I have had a similar experience with a teacher just constantly calling on me to read things off the board even though I specifically told her when I arrived in her class I cannot see and to please not call on me. It is very embarrassing to have to walk up in front of everyone else who can see, stand a foot away from the board, and have to read because of my eyes. Eventually I was kicked out of the school and sent to what is called an \"alternative high school\" because I eventually refused to get up anymore. This tanked my grades as a result and that is why they sent me away.\n\nI do not know what country you are in but if it is the US just know people have similar experiences to you even if they do not have SM. Some teachers are just very evil people. Wow. What is wrong with that teacher, I wonder? Makes me wonder if we are better off to just say we have social anxiety disorder instead of selective mutism. Anyway, condolences. Let us hope teachers get better at this stuff. I am glad you shared this. And I am glad everyone else had more helpful things to say than me. Supposedly changing it from elective mutism was supposed to fix this. But I have often wondered myself how much of an improvement \"selective\" is. The word still contains connotations of choosing. It really shows how people do not understand mental health. I hate it too and usually say I have a mental disorder before I use selective mutism. I really do not want people think I am some weirdo who decided to take a vow of silence or something.\n\nThe name should really be changed to something else. That sucks, for my end of school exams we had to do a speech in front of the class, I went to this teacher to ask if I could do it 1-1 just with her(she had already agreed to let a few other students do this, who do not have selective mutism and were apparently just nervous about doing it), she said no because she had seen me talking to my friends in class so she assumed there was nothing wrong with me anymore, even when I explained I still struggle a lot her argument was \u2018you will never learn to speak publicly if you do not start now\u2019 which I kind of get, but also selective mutism does not work like that, I cannot always just choose when I am ready to speak. I am pretty sure that one teacher increased my anxiety about public speaking a lot, because by being forced into it it just made me want to voluntarily speak even less, luckily most of my teachers now are a lot better, and even after just being at this new school for a few months I have got so much better at speaking which I am pretty sure is due to not being forced into it so much like I was before", "Does this sound like SM? I know- if this is SM- it all started when I was about 11. I only speak until I am spoken to. Here is two examples: \n\nI am walking my dog and neighbors yells some joke at me. I laugh, smile, problem say \u201cyeah\u201d and walk on.\n\nI went to an amusement park with 3 girls, two who I did not know. I did not talk until they spoke to me the entire trip, yet were aware how that is unusual, and even made a comment. \u201cThis is the most she is talked the entire trip\u201d (that did not hurt me, do not worry). \n\nI am not autistic, but I do have social anxiety. I have heard about this before but it seems like it is not just an average social anxiety thing? Idk. It is definitely possible. Some people with SM are more verbal and are able to give short responses to questions, but cannot initiate. I recommend trying to get diagnosed. You can get diagnosed by someone like a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist. This is the first step in overcoming SM. I also stop talking at around 12. I talked a lot with the guy friend next to me. However, by the end of my 6th grade, he asked me why I was quiet all of a sudden. Years after, I can only answer questions. It might be SM. It is not just an autistic thing. It is a severe form of social anxiety disorder.", "Ignorant Boss My boss refuses to understand selective mutism. She says she does, but she also tells me that I got to communicate and does not seem to know that pressure can make the anxiety worse.  My Spanish teacher is like that too. Constantly picks me even tho half the class wants to answer her questions If you have the option to join a union, take it. Even if your workplace does not have a union, you may be able to join an industry wide one. \n\nWhen dealing with this kind of stuff it can help to have back up (though YMMV since the balance of power at work has shifted so far towards employers and away from labour in recent years.)", "do you think you struggle with substance abuse because of this disorder? or if you just have the disorder and you relatively abuse substances\n\n(", "what qualifies as being selectively mute? heyo, i am 15 and in highschool and i have been noticing in having a harder and harder time communicating with people but i am not sure if i am mute enough to be selectively mute? if that makes sense? it is gradually gotten worse over time it started as i could only talk to close friends, to only being able to talk to adults, to only being able to talk to close adults, to now just family members and even then i try to avoid family so i do not talk to them. ive been sent to the guidance counselor multiple times because of this and there have been times where i just sat there and said nothing cause i genuinely couldnt say much cause what was i supposed to say anyways? it is been going on for years but i feel like it is getting worse and idk what to do exactly. when someone talks to me i just\u2026blank out? and stare which i know is very off putting. anyways, does anyone have any advice or tips or relatable stories or something? i just needed to vent", "Interpreting selective mutism as a behavioral problem is harmful I kind of been thinking about this for a couple of days, that basically those who have gotten upset with me (severely punished me) for not speaking were interpreting my verbal behavior in this way as if it was behavioral disorder.\n\nSince SM is actually an anxiety disorder, this kind of thinking makes it worse and causes small amounts of trauma to build up over time if done enough times. \n\nAnd being around people who see me this way makes it less safe to speak or communicate. I started experiencing selective mutism when I was 20 (though I wonder if it ever showed up before as a kid and I just did not know what it was). Because of how old I was, it was difficult for my family to understand. I remember going through experiences with each of them where they tried to understand it this way, as a behavior or a choice. \n\nIt was hardest for my brother who was 2 years younger, because he was living out of state for a couple years and did not get to live through it with the rest of my family. So when he came home, he had a huge learning curve and his personality made him very unsympathetic. I remember being so angry at him for dismissing my silence and frustration at feeling like he was making it worse. \n\nI do not know if you have seen Friends, but there is this hand gesture one of the characters made up that meant he was flipping you off. I was so mad, so I did that gesture. My parents were shocked, but it made me feel better.\n\nAnyway, just trying to say that I sympathize with your pain. I have had this happen. I remember a particular moment in grade school that ended with me crying. And then recently I had a relapse and someone misinterpreted it. Feels absolutely ridiculous that I could not talk as an adult, so I do not blame them. \u270a\ud83c\udffb\u270a\ud83c\udffb", "How this all feels to me; wrote this way before I knew about selective mutism, and thought I would share Is it white noise or silence that was left here? They weaved a cobweb into my throat and the words became tangled. It is all as uncertain as blank sheet music. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom would always tell me I should live the way I want to, because there is always a new day, but what do I do if I no longer have my thoughts under control and cannot see the next dawn?\n\nI tried so hard to fight these feelings, but every night I could feel monsters crawl deeper and deeper down my throat. They clinged to my lungs with their sharp claws, and I wanted to cry, but the silence had stolen my voice. No one can hear the mute, but there are times when no sound come out of my throat either.", "does it really get better ?? /gen i hate it i hate it i hate it. ive had sm my whole life and im really losing hope, I just want to be normal I want to make friends. im 15 and have never went out with a friend once, its pathetic really. i dont know what to do, its gets more painful everyday. hM I am 17 and honestly, depends.\ni still have not been able to make a single friend in rl and I have come to terms with it, having online friends helped me a lot honestly. Do not know how I will get a job tho ;-;\n\nso 50/50 chance that it will get better B) It gets better. If it does not, it does get easier. \n\nI am almost completely silent, and I am currently a top engineering student at my university. In all my time at college, I have not made a single friend, but that is okay to me. Online, I have a very small group of friends who I love, including my best friend (who happens to be hard of hearing). We met through Tumblr when we were your age. In everyday life, I may not talk, but I still see people everyday who will exchange a smile or a wave with me. Some days, I almost forget that other people speak to each other. It will not always hurt like it does right now. I promise. Hi! I am 11, and spend most of my days in my room crying, and wondering if I will ever be normal. I have ocd sm, and no friends. I do not know what to do! It gets harder by the minute! Whoa, I have SM and my closest friend is also hard of hearing haha I feel the same as you. I am graduating high school this year, and I am dreading what will come after high school, because the little sense of safety and security I have as a child will be gone. I have been crying a lot more. I really hope things will get better for all of us. I am 22 and for me it did.  I would start by chatting with randoms online, discord, games etc, and dont be bothered to get judged by ppl online cuz you will never see them again. Progress is the best part, everything after that is just rewards. Haha, nice! I was diagnosed at 5, and was silent all through high school. Never went out with friends my whole life (and still have not). \n\nSecond year university now and I work part time at a call center/help desk now, so it definitely can get better, if only a little at a time. :) 15 may be your entire life but it will not be your whole life. Things get worse before they get better and you will learn that one day. Popularity is not everything and it can kick rocks. Just ride the wave and as long as you do not handicap yourself by never getting out there, in time you will see treatment through exposure.", "my experience with sm Has anyone else ever been looked down on/ treated with disrespect for being unable to speak? I remember after I had a massive anxiety attack at my middle school meeting,  it was finally recognized that I have anxiety by the teachers, but at the same time they would act very irritated at me when i didnt want to do a presentation at the front of the classroom and they would purposefully pick on me to answer questions. Another time I went to a \"psychiatrist\" who sat me down and literally just stared at me saying absolutely nothing while i was having an anxiety attack and bawling my eyes out. That was probably the moment that I developed selective mutism. First day of high school and my mom informed the school about my anxiety and sm, and the first thing they did to me was they made me take an IQ test to see if I was mentally re\\*arded. The PE teachers were blatantly rude to me, they yelled at me in my face telling me to \"speak up\". They would literally act like I was such a nuisance when i was in their presence, saying things like \"how do I even deal with her?\". I was passed around different schools because I would skip classes due to anxiety and eventually they put me into a special ed school where they treated me like I was a toddler who was mentally disabled, even though I have no learning disability (apart from add). Many even accused me of being autistic, even though Ive went to a professional and wasnt diagnosed with it after all. It was so frustrating, so humiliating to be talked down, to be treated like I was a baby, like some kind of freak. The last place I was sent to was a residential treatment center and I was kept there against my will, and I was treated to the equivalent of a criminal. Yes, I have received a lot of abuse over the years from people who used my silence and anxiety against me. It is difficult for me to go into details about it. (I have not been diagnosed with sm, but about a few months ago I became completely mute to everyone and it was only recently that I have been able to somewhat talk to 3 people and I do have a lot of the symptoms of sm) but Ive also been disrespected for being unable to speak to the majority of the people in my life. People keep thinking that me being mute is just a choice, like a switch that I can turn on to talk and off when \u201cI do not want to talk\u201d and it is frustrating because it is not at all like that. And they think so highly of themselves for bearing with me since I \u201cdo not want to talk right now\u201d but they have brought it up so many times that even if I told them that this is not something I chose and that it is an anxiety disorder and kind of a coping mechanism for me they would not even listen. That happened to me too, they probably thought I was being \u201cdefiant\u201d and \u201cstubborn\u201d for not speaking, even though it was something out of my control. I even remember my classmates prodding me to \u201cspeak\u201d and they had the same tone of voice of talking to a baby", "Any way to avoid Japanese? I am going to a psychologist some time soon and I will hopefully get diagnosed with SM there. My school does a system with our electives where we have to take each one at least once, with a few exceptions. One that we have to do though, is Japanese. We can out get out of it if we have a VERY good reason. If I got diagnosed with SM before I have to do Japanese (I have to do it some time next year), would I be able to do something instead of Japanese?\n\nLast year I had to do it a lot but I was still able to whisper a bit around people. Now I am at the point where I do not talk at all at school. I am thinking I could get the psychologist to maybe write something that would give me permission to do something else?\n\nThe Japanese is going to be a lot of speaking and not much writing, and being asked to speak also gives me a lot of anxiety. Back when I was in school, I was not allowed to take a language class even though it was required to graduate. I actually wanted to take French but again, wasn t allowed. Your school might be different. Ask for accommodation, it would let you exempt from anything where you have to speak but still take the class! You would most likely have to compensate for it like recording you speak and turn that in to the teacher instead of speaking in front of everyone, or do extra writing work. Good luck! :) Since SM is related to anxiety, avoiding the class altogether might actually be harmful. When we give in to our anxiety and avoid something, it tells our brains that the thing we were scared of is actually dangerous, when really it is not. This can reinforce the anxiety and make it worse and harder to overcome. \n\nYes, SM and anxiety suck, but using them as an excuse not to do something will only make it harder for you in the long run. As other people have said, see if you can take the class with accomodations, such as recording yourself, or doing extra writing assignments (kanji are not as scary as they seem and kana are really not bad at all!) \n\nYou can also look at another language as an opportunity. When we speak in a different language, we are different versions of ourselves. Maybe the you who speaks in Japanese is more confident. Especially if it is a beginner class, you have the opportunity to practice speaking in an environment where everyone will be uncertain and there will be less judgement. There are relatively few sounds in Japanese and it is a very logical language at the beginner level. \n\nJapanese is such a different language from English that it is actually really freeing to learn. I like the person I am when I speak Japanese more than who I am in English. Learning Japanese  was a big part of my SM recovery. \n\nI really encourage you to take the class. Give yourself the opportunity to enjoy it! While I do agree, avoidance will just create an even bigger hole, it also depends on how severe your SM is. If you are very anxious and cannot speak at all, jumping into the class might be a bit too much too soon. If OP could speak a little already it would be different. Perhaps you could do extra credit by asking your teacher to learn JSL? Or asking the District to take an online course by its self or be exempted together because of your disability you were medically diagnosed with! Do what makes you feel safe! This hit lose to home! I have to do Japanese tutoring and I do not feel ok speaking to my Japanese tutor, I would rather to the writing part instead, but I have to diagnosed first.", "What do you different if you are home alone....I am for the moment. Sister's are away, rest of everyone else is at dinner....out.\n\nWhy did I not go? Because for me to eat, my Mom says I need to tell the waiter my order. I will not unless they were not there, and if they were not unless I was motivated to, I probably would not.\n\nWhen I am home alone, now...I really do nothing I would not normally do if they were here. 18, and have a car.....from my dad, so I could go somewhere, but I never would. Always paranoid they will return, and still I just would not do it.\n\nJust curious, I guess...idk For me personally, I would probably just stay home and appreciate the quiet lol. Maybe take advantage of this time for self care or something. I like watching my favorite \u201ccomfort movies\u201d when I am home alone, or painting my nails or something. Just do something that makes you happy :)  I know that it feels like they are punishing you for something you cannot control. But rather than think of it as a punishment, think of it as a reward. \n\nWhen I get left home and the rest of my family goes out I spend some time for myself. I do not let my sm control me when I am at home alone, instead I empty out my bucket of stress, and think about anything other than the reason I am home, and my anxiety, and do something I enjoy. \n\nIt is about time we took some time for ourselves. Tell that bully inside you to go away, and just do something that is relaxing. It is exhausting to come home from school/work, without saying a word, and come home feeling stressed, and dumb so when you come home, and you get stuck staying at home, use it as a time where you can live life, and have a no stress time.", "Selective Mutism and Social Anxiety Disorder - not always together  Meanwhile I have both :( rip me I am a bit confused by this, to be honest. SM is classified as an anxiety disorder. So should not instances of SM unrelated to anxiety have another label or maybe subtype since you are really looking at a different condition that is not being caused by anxiety?\n\nApologies if this comes across as dismissive, I would just like more information on what SM without anxiety might look like. \n\nHere is what natasha had to say about that. I think my confusion lies in the fact that she is limiting her definition of social anxiety to straightforward anxious thoughts, while I consider anxiety a physical sensation that might occur as a consequence of worry, among other things. My lack of speech was automatic too, but in hindsight I can see that it was rooted in a deep social fear, even though I did not necessarily have a conscious or specific fear. I understand others might have a different experience or look at it differently, though. Thanks for sharing.", "How can I turn a guy down when its super hard? So Ive come a very long way since I started forcing myself to talk. I am able to have conversations with people and interact with others and pass off as someone who is social, when I really am not. I am very proud of it but theres still situations that come up that I cannot bring myself to say what needs to be said in. \n\nToday at my new job, a coworker that I am not interested in tried asking me out. Before he tried to ask me out, he was talking nonstop to me about how he needs a girlfriend and I knew he would try to ask me out the second he complained about his lack of girlfriend. I cannot stand this person. I joke around with him when he jokes around, but when we joke around I feel super icked out. I feel like I HAVE to joke with him because if I do not I will offend him because he makes a pouty face. \n\nThe first time he tried to ask me out, he asked if I have a boyfriend. I said \u201cno and I do not want one\u201d he then said \u201cwhy not? Im lonely I need a girlfriend. I am wide open!\u201d I said \u201cwell that is good for you. I am not.\u201d He said \u201cwell we could hang out sometime\u201d and this is where I could not talk my mind. My mind was screaming \u201cNO. NO. NO.\u201d but my mouth said \u201cyeahhhh\u2026\u2026 we could\u201d but it was a no yeah. It had no in my tone and I tried to make it very obvious that I was not being serious with that \u201cyeah\u201d. Im scared of saying no and offending people. However, I respect my boundaries and I will never date someone that I do not want to be with. This thing is not going anywhere, I am not going to let it. But he cannot take a hint and I know I have to tell him no but its so hard. \n\nAfter this situation he cornered me in the supply room and said \u201cI have a prize for you! You have to guess what it is!!\u201d And i was busy, he was interrupting me while I was looking for something for a customer that was waiting on me. That customer could hear this interaction. I said to him \u201cidk what you are doing. I do not understand what is going on (i did, he was flirting.), just tell me the surprise then help me look for this item\u201d the surprise was his phone number so we could hang out later. If I just told him no to hanging out, he would not be doing that. I wanted to scream. \n\nFor the rest of my shift he kept bringing up how his phone # is in my pocket and to not lose it. My facial expressions were very \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udd76\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd74. Idk how he did not get the hint. I am very pretty and find myself in these situations often, and each time I freeze up. Its such a vulnerable interaction. Hes known me for 2 days and is way too old for me anyways. I really like this job and do not want to quit over this. I am also extremely worried about getting fired for my rude facial expressions. Ive been doing a great job at my job so far and I am super polite to everyone but this darned situation is testing me. Guy sounds like a real ass, I am sorry you have to deal with someone who obviously needs to deal with his own issues before even trying to find a relationship.\n\nUnfortunately he seems intent on not taking the hint, the only real way to undercut whatever plausible deniability he is clinging to would be to tell him directly you are not interested. I assume you would not want to text him this, though it might be easier, thereby giving him your actual phone number. If it makes it easier you could perhaps write it down and recite it to him, something direct like \"I am not interested in hanging out and constantly bringing it up causes me extra stress when I just want to do my job here\". Do not worry about being too harsh, the goal is to not give him a chance to underplay your stance or to find a hidden meaning. This is your life and your livelihood, his insistence is his own personal problem.\n\nIf he is anything but respectful of your request then it would be appropriate to escalate to the manager or other authority. Hell it probably would be already, but if you feel up to it it would probably be easier in the long run to address him yourself. If his comments and criticisms are already causing you stress it may be appropriate to do that anyways, just know that management may not behave how you might hope. At least it will look better if you are able to say you gave him an unequivocal 'not interested'.\n\nIt seems like he is probably picked up on some stupid pickup artist tactics in his desperation for a girlfriend, his criticisms sound like 'negging' and his insistence despite your reservations are common with that type of bad dating advice. Likely he is a very insecure person anyways; I hope he has the sense to back off but it already seems like he may be a bit senseless generally. Good luck to you, remember that you are not required to spare his feelings at the expense of your own Thank you for this! I was up at night debating whether or not I should be harsh about it or be super nice. I am going to be stern about it. I considered texting him with a text plus number but I ended up losing the piece of paper anyways. \n\nDuring my interview the manager said she has a no drama policy and they have a zero harassment policy so hopefully if I have to bring it to management, she does not see me as dramatic and addresses it. I am sure I am not the first girl he is done this to. Be harsh, dawg I think he figured it out on his own because he did not acknowledge me today but theres a slight possibility that he is ignoring me as one of his pick up tactics Stern is perfect, polite but firm. That sounds promising in terms of management's support, and yes he likely does this to many girls, probably anyone who has not told him 'no thanks' directly. Just say you do not date coworkers so he doesnt take it personal", "Mutism and mood I have not done much research on selective mutism, but I think I have it. It was worse in my 20s when I barely talked. But after being diagnosed and treated for anxiety/depression at 30, I became less selectively mute only to become more mute again during the pandemic. \n\nMy mutism largely depends on my mood. If my sleep, exercise, or diet slips, I am more prone to it. It also seems most days at my job, chatting with coworkers is an arduous task that takes a great deal of mental energy that I lack most days.  But maybe 20% of the time when I feel good mentally and physically, chatting feels effortless. Does anyone else struggle with inconsistent moods and selective mutism? I just hate how I can barely utter words to people who I have had long and easily flowing conversations. This causes me to back off socially and makes maintaining friendships   difficult. I can Often sense how my silence is off-putting as others think I hate them when my conversational mind goes blank or how jarring it can be for others to interact with such a split personality. I mean having effortless conversations are impossible for me no matter what my mood is so idk Well I have SM and do not have those kinds of conversations (maybe on Xbox, in the past). Though when my mood is GREAT, the want to recover from SM is much greater, and it feels more possible. I can kind of relate to this. In rare moments when I am in a really good mood and feeling energetic, I actually want to socialize and bond with people. Majority of the time, I am closed off and probably sending out \"go away\" vibes cuz I do not want to have to try making small talk. I do not have the energy to mimic a happy and sociable personality and just want to conserve the energy I do have. And no conversation goes well if I am not happy.

Hey man same problem reading your post was writing down my own problem You are so young, if you get things right you can make enough progress in a year you will feel like anything's possible age 20-21.\n\nI did not start making real progress with SM until I was like 23-24 :( but I am at a point now where even though things are not perfect, I know what progress looks like and I am optimistic about the future. \n\nI recommend either getting a job or learning a skill or taking classes (there are online options). If you think it is too much of a challenge right now, honestly, it is okay. But make sure you are doing something and making progress in that goal. One good option is exercise, since that might help with your anxiety a little. Or if you already have other hobbies, try to take the time to measure the progress you made in your goals. Improving your mental health is also a matter of putting in the time, and trust that you will see results if you work for them.\n\nI am currently seeing a therapist and taking medication. Medication was a godsend for my issue, honestly, it made a big difference. So I encourage you to talk to a psychiatrist or your family doctor.

(Just so you know, I have been diagnosed with selective mutism) that is what happened to me as well. I could talk to someone I trusted but froze up around new people or strangers. It sounds like you do have SM, but do you get that anxious, frozen feeling when you are faced with socializing? Yes. I am no doctor, but that is one of the big symptoms of SM. Have you seen someone for it or are diagnosed with social anxiety? Unfortunately SM makes the chance of social anxiety much worse\n :( I noticed one of these... :( \n\n\n\n So here take this... :D I have symptoms of autism too, Currently being diagnosed for it. But no never for selective mutism ^^ If you are currently undergoing tests for Autism, you most likely do not have selective mutism. I have performed numerous case studies on SM and, while the symptoms in both cases are very similar, SM affects mainly children (5-8). In my professional opinion, you are most likely suffering from Autism, which severely hinders speech. Both autism and selective mutism are VERY similar in symptom presentation. I hope that clears up some confusion :)", "Just learned about selective mutism today Just learned about selective mutism today, and my mind has been blown (in a minor way).  Based on the description, I think I may have had some form of this when I was younger. \n\nBack then I just thought I was shy. More recently, I just thought it was social anxiety, especially when I lost my words and found myself unable to form a verbal response to questions unless I was in a specific setting/environment/comfort level. Throughout the years, my teachers' most common complaint to my parents was that I never talked unless it was in a one-on-one setting after class. \n\nNow I exhibit more general and social anxiety, though I still have situations where I lose my words. \n\nThough it is possible I am overthinking this and may just in fact be shy!", "I have a question for you all. First I would like to start off by saying I do not believe I have SM however I have had a few experiences where something just \"clicks\" and for like 5 or more minutes I cannot really talk. It takes so much effort to get a few words out but after a few minutes I am usually fine. The frequency of these events are few and far apart so it is not something that affects me severely. I thought I would ask you guys as I believe that this is the best place to ask this question. I would just like to know what could be happening in those moments and if it is anything you can relate too.\n\nThat is all.

Glad to help!", "I have mostly overcome SM, one big tip, make only small changes in the setting you are currently in and settle for that without panicking that you are getting worse or stuck and venture out to other groups for new, healthier interactions I recently read about something called clustering, which is defined as violence in response to a change in group homeostasis (the way things are). Actually the term they used is family homeostasis but I think you see this response everywhere.  \n\nIn dysfunctional families, family homeostasis can mean sexual abuse, verbal and physical violence, alcoholism. It is the way things are. Even though the behaviors are objectively bad and obviously undesired by everyone they will still respond negatively when a member changes course in their behavior. So they \"keep each other down\". A psychologist talks about it more in depth in ( article. This is how the family might respond specifically:\n\n&gt;As I said earlier, however, that would only be the first thing that would happen if someone with BPD started to act better. The next thing that happens is that the parents start to act out in alarming and frightening ways. I am talking about such things as the parents making suicide threats or actual attempts, increasing their drug or alcohol abuse to higher and higher levels, worsening their level of domestic violence, throwing other family members out on the street\u00a0penniless, or abusing or\u00a0neglecting\u00a0any children left in the home. You know\u2014minor, inconsequential stuff.\n\nThis happened to me in my battle with SM. I was being kept sick by my family and only figured out what was happening in hindsight.\n\nI feel like it happened in school too. Any group I think is liable to react negatively to a change in someone is \"rank\", if you want to see it that way. ( might be of interest to you if you want to read more about how a scientist was \"taken down\" in rank in a university setting. She went from a respected researcher to public enemy after she spoke out about sexual harassment. The process of progressively becoming someone who was verbally and emotionally abused on a daily basis, accused of a serious crime (against her nation I think) and eventually fired is explained. It is a phenomenon called mobbing.\n\nSo what I am saying is... you might want to fight for more of a social life or since you have limited power and any attempts at getting better should be done in a safe setting you can just mostly keep your head down. I would actually advise that. Focus on just getting a handle on the basics. I think any changes you make should be attempted in the easiest, nicest setting possible most of the time and that might not be any of your current social settings. \n\nBack when my SM was really bad I consistently ended up in situations where I was interacting with bullies (a hell level of a social challenge) and failed miserably, could go completely silent, it was humiliating. In those situations, I sometimes felt like the people around me were just toying with me. It had long term effects on my self image I wish I would avoided completely. It is okay if you are friendless and you struggle with your relationships with the staff. You are not just selectively mute, you also have to think of the overall quality of your relationships and their affect on your mental health.\n\nI wish I would been more focused on how healthy my relationships were even if we were communicating through smoke signs. If you are likely to get a negative response when you attempt to open up, your anxiety will just get worse when you try again next time. Over the long term it can make your SM worse.\n\nI think a good first step you can be in complete control of is to talk to yourself. If you are able to, film yourself and when you watch it consciously try to be accepting and accommodating of your pauses, maybe quirky body language, anything you are self conscious of. It helps with your self image and convincing yourself there is nothing wrong with the way you communicate. I think it could be really empowering to just talk to yourself and be the first to be accepting and encouraging of yourself in making progress. ", "Psychologist without diagnosis? Around a month ago my mum took me to see my gp so I could see a psychologist. I was just googling about medication and how it gets prescribed, and saw something about how psychiatrists are the ones to diagnose stuff.\n\nIs it bad that I am going to get treatment without being diagnosed? Or am I actually able to get diagnosed by a psychologist?\nWill I be told to get diagnosed before seeing the psychologist? Or will it be fine to just go see them without one? It is not bad to get treatment without being diagnosed, in fact, I recommend doing so. If you need to get diagnosed, your therapist will tell you. \n\nGetting a diagnosis can be a lot of trouble and is not really worth it in my opinion. It can be good for your own mental health (to have a label for your problem). It can also help with insurance issues. Psychologists (specifically clinical psychologists - though it might vary depending on your location) can give diagnoses. It is a big part of what they can do. \nThey cannot prescribe medicine because they are not medical doctors like psychiatrists. But if you need both therapy and medication a psychologist will usually work with your GP or with a psychiatrist to sort that stuff out. \n\nBest of luck going forwards. Depends on what state you are in, if they can diagnose and prescribe medication.", "How the F do I get a job? I have been invited to several interviews, but so far have only completed one in person and one over phone. \n\nUsually I get there, stare at the building for a few minutes then drive home in a fit of rage (I have not hated myself this much since elementary school).\n\nI had two in one week; the phone one where a sat sweaty on the bathroom floor, hand gripped so tightly to the phone it began to cramp up, and could not think straight and began to speak in circles to the interviewer.\n\nThe second was a few days after at Starbucks; I went in, stood at the door (for god knows how long?), then went back to my car and drove home.\n\nI am seriously going to die if I do not get a job, but stupid me cannot even enter a godamn building.\n\nIdk if I am venting or seeking advice, but I cannot be motivated to look for jobs knowing it is going to be this same act over and over again.\n\nP.S. I cannot do that HireVue thing they have been using lately, so thanks a lot virus. What in particular makes you anxious about an interview? And why cannot you do Hirevue? maybe try looking for warehouse jobs or jobs that do not necessarily require you to work with people a whole lot. Maybe u could try sending them an email/text before hand, if ur more comfy w online communication, to just kind of explain that u have a disability n if it would be right if u wrote/texted/something else ur answers to interview questions, n maybe if they have any openings where u can work without having to communicate w people? I do not know if this will be even remotely helpful, but I am planning on learning to code so that I can work from home and never have to speak to another person. It is not something that interests me, but I love the idea of not having to interact with people at work. Ok, first take a big breath and let it out slow.\n\nSecond, I think you need to come up with a plan of how you think this convo could go and practice it, preferably with another person, but do it out loud.\n\nLook up interview practice questions. Record yourself on your phone asking and answering questions (You can write q&amp;a ahead of time). Then listen to it. Think about how you want to change or keep this conversation. Repeat.\n\nCan not emphasize practicing enough, even if it is all by yourself z I have stayed at my current job way longer than I would have liked too for exactly this... interviews are literally the worst! Before I go into an interview I try to remind myself that I am most likely never going to see the person again if it goes wrong and I try to literally just act like someone else who is more confident lol. It is hard but it is literally the hardest part and it gets easier from there! Preparing some answers before hand can really help too, obviously you do not know exactly what they are going to ask but having a general idea of how you would describe your last job and how it applies to the job your applying for etc. Sometimes you can probably even find the questions they will be asking for places like Starbucks. Maybe next time show up a bit earlier just to get comfortable and familiar with the place and give yourself some time. I recommend a therapist specializing in SM to slowly help you gain your social confidence, they can recommend good technics and generally help with frusturation. I have one and I know have been getting much better! 10/10 recommend even if sounds scary it was for me at first too. Maybe some alcohol to calm yourself beforehand without going overboard. I find having some drinks before a date frees up some mental energy. I am still at a loss for words and lose train of thought but it helps somewhat. I might try that next time if the email is an actual person instead of one of those auto response ones. It is not really the interview that stresses me out.\n\nFor raising canes, it was because they asked me to approach one of their outdoor workers since they were not letting people in due to pandemic (&amp; I have never been able to just approach someone and talk to them). For chickfila it was because I could not find the front door because it was super busy and seemed like the drive through wrapped around the whole building. Starbucks (I did go in) all the workers were busy and I was not sure how to go about getting their attention, and the floor had these arrows (because of pandemic) so I think I went through the wrong door. Was too stressed by that point and left.\n\nCannot do Hirevue because I have untreated GD, and really cannot stand seeing/hearing myself on video. I would actually love to work with other people, but SM really gets in the way of me doing that. But I hope you achieve your dreams of working from home. =\\] I do the same thing with acting like someone more confident than myself (or as I used to say, the coolest guy in school who everyone wanted to be friends with). It worked quite well in highschool, but I am way out of practice after I left midway through sophomore year (5 years ago). I would try that, but I am still under 21 so I cannot buy any. I do warehouse work. What I did was that I had a temp agency set me up. Some might require interview but there are more than one agency. Contact them by mail. If they are not willing to accommodate you, then try another one. Their only job is getting YOU a job. It helps looking at it from that point. But I know how you feel, it is the worst feeling. I cannot talk to random people no matter how much I wish. Sounds like you just need a little more practice then! I saw in another reply you mentioned you enjoy working with other people and tbh getting a customer service job as my first one was the best thing I ever did for my shyness/anxiety/SM! I would always recommend others the same instead of a job that requires isolation. Its a great way to be forced to build (somewhat) of a relationship with your coworkers and gets you practicing small talk with strangers. I wish you the best of luck on your next interview! Oh then disregard sorry haha I can completely relate.  There is been many times I have stood outside the door or pretended to wander around and then decided to leave because I was too anxious to walk in or approach anyone.  \n\nFirst off, you should get treated for this if you have not already.  That is really your best option.\n\nMaybe you can take a local college class to get used to communicating with others or simply being around other people.\n\nMy family pretty much forced me to get a job because they said I was anti-social to the point of becoming agoraphobic (not true imo).  I work as a dietary server at a somewhat ritzy retirement community, and aside from coworkers, I only deal with the residents that are completely dependent.\n\nMeeting my coworkers was nerve wracking but it honestly did not turn out as bad as I had imagined, most of them are pretty cool and accept that I do not talk much.  I hope this makes you feel less anxious about meeting new coworkers.\n\nAlso, dealing with older people who have dementia is much easier than dealing with your average person.  Maybe you can look into working at a place like this, if you find it interesting.\n\nDownside is I have been here making minimum wage for the past three years.  I know I could get hired at a higher paying job if I tried but I do not because I am scared.\n\nSo maybe a job similar to mine would be good for you to start with.  Once you have work experience you can try other jobs that you prefer and pay more.", "Any tips on how to overcome SM? I have had Selective Mutism as far back as I can remember.

Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome SM?  Are you still homeschooled I have selective mutism, and my parents made me go to a big prep school for high school, and I can honestly say that it has helped me overcome my SM because I have to talk to people and through clubs and co-cirriculars it has allowed me to meet so many amazing people.

Sorry my reply is so late, and yes. :( Love that optimism! :)", "Would it be bad for me to go to a mental hospital if I have selective mutism? I have been thinking about going for my depression cause i have tried everything else and nothing else has worked. I am under 18 so i am scared a mental hospital will just be like a school. Medication could help... i have tried so many different ones over the years, none have worked for me I went to a residential treatment program for anxiety disorders called Roger's Memorial Hospital as a teenager where I completely recovered from SM. I think it can be a very positive experience depending on the program. It was scary at first, but I had the oppurtunity to make a lot of progress through exposure therapy and CBT, make friends, and do some fun things like paddleboarding and caving. I found my experience overall positive. you dont need to be in a mental hospital to receive psychiatric medication\n\nand its arguably better to see a psychiatrist with their own practice than to see one at a mental hospital I have ptsd from mental hospital when i was underage. It was like a prison/abusive confinement relationship in terms of staff-patient interactions. Patient-patient interactions werent bad tho. Some ppl have positive transformative hospital experiences. Ask on a local board about ur local childrens hospital mental ward for recent experiences... the attitude of the staff working currently make all the difference in how it will go for you and whether its a beneficial or detrimental stay. It sounds like it might depend on the mental hospital in question and the programs they have available. Do not go into it blind, research first. I am a psychiatrist. If you are suicidal then please do go into hospital. Let me know if I can help you find a good one.", "I cannot believe I found this page Hi everyone, I am so grateful that I have found this group. As a young child, I struggled with this until the age of 6. I always felt self-conscious and different about the fact that I was unable to speak to my extended family and adults. I never knew why. At some point, I found out that this is called, \"Selective Mutism,\" but never really found any solid answers or resources. I have just clicked on some of the links and I am near tears because I cannot believe there are so many of us. \n\nIf anyone wants to be friends or talk about this, pm me. I will most likely understand. Maybe we can swap stories or share knowledge or skills we have acquired! we are grateful you are here :D Thanks, friend. I feel you, as a child I had never talk in school , I have few classmate who have guts to talk to me, but most of the time my voice tend to be too low to the point that they cant hear me, when I went to college I want to change it, I become alcoholic so i can be friendly and can speak to everyone. but it did not help me.\n\nNow Im an adult and already a mom, I want to know what causes that behavior of mine, and as I learned I am maybe introvert and i might have dyslexia.\n\nIm slow learner before, that is why I tend to be quiet, my teachers are also bully, because of that I became shy and quiet. now I think I have dyslexia, as an adult I am pretty normal now. but im still introvert.\n\nsorry for bad english, just want to share it, my past make me sad That is tough. I know. Part of knowing these things now makes me remember some painful times growing up. I am still not sure why exactly I struggled with this either. All I know is that it is anxiety related and my own internal dialogue contributed to it. For example, there were times I really wanted to speak, but I would have these fears that everyone would make a huge deal out of it, and that kept me inside. I am also an introvert and have made peace with that. My honey got me a book called, \"The Introvert Advantage\" and it helped me realize that being naturally quiet is okay. I still have anxiety sometimes, but I can manage. glad you can manage it now.. reading this makes me think about my past.. and it is true that people around you will make a huge deal seeing us talk or have emotions. it is really pathetic feeling.. and not a single teacher manage to help me or got curious on knowing what is wrong with me, even my parents, now it hurts remembering school days.. I hate the memories about it.. thank you for sharing this, and I sure check out that book :) You know, I think you just hit the nail on the head with something. Sometimes I felt like if people didnt see me, I could not speak. What I mean by that is- when we look past the externals of a person and desire to get to know them in a loving way. A mistake adults make is trying to put people into boxes instead of just letting them be them. It made me feel invisible when people saw me as, \"a little kid\" or \"a stubborn girl,\" instead of the real me, a living soul. Is that what you felt too when you talk about teachers at school? I just found this page. Oddly specific. To find an actual page on this.\nIf we are sharing stories...\n\nI had SM for as long as I can remember.\nI did not speak to my uncle and aunt and only spoke to my parents and other uncle and grandmother.\n\nWhy have SM though? Is it because we do not outgrow the shy toddler stage? Where you hide behind your parents when someone talks to you? Then they laugh it off and you think it is all ok to do that? Anyway...\n\nI did fine in school but never spoke.\nMy school helped me by having a program where (idk every week?) id come in early and play games or whatever with someone else I was kind of ok talking to. (Cannot remember why i did not do this program with my closer friend though) and my teacher would spend his time literally standing outside the door and as time went on he would get closer.\nWent to a specialist 700km away. Idk she helped and probably was the one who set up all this stuff with the school. I do not remember much.\nI remember once when a guy in my class caught me off guard and I replied to him and I swear I went white. Was the most terrifying thing ever.\n\nNow I am all good\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc yes, they actually make fun of me too.. as for me it really hurts, because they supposed to help me, but in my schooldays, making fun of me is encouraging bullies to also do it. You are correct that in those moments I just want them to see the real me inside this quiet shy girl, adults must treat me like a living soul.. they should have known better. \n\nNow that Im already a mother, If my child falls to same faith of introversion, I will support him and try to help him in dealing with the world. I will encourage him to tell me his problems. hope things will get right for my son now \u263a\ufe0f it is a relief as an adult reading that someone out there is same with me as a child.. you are lucky because you have support \u263a\ufe0f Yeah. It would also be nice to help other kids with it. Just sitting down and talking to them. Telling them that you had the same thing and you do not expect them to say anything because you understand what it is like. yes good suggestion.. hope I could able to do that soon, It will make them feel better this is how i felt when i found this group :) Gosh, that is so painful. I hope those teachers look back on that with regret. I am glad your a supportive mother. Even though of memories are painful, I am using them as motivation to better understand others. yes thank you.. that is our advantage, we can be more understanding \ud83d\ude0a", "How can I start a romantic relationship?  So, if I have any interest in dating someone how am I supposed to do so? I am an 18 y.o. male with no idea how to even to talk to a girl. Now, I am not thinking about dating someone, but in the future it is something I would like to do, but I do not know how to approach a girl and talking to someone is near impossible. Does someone have any tips on how to start this kind of relationship or even your own story on how you started dating?\n\n  Also, it is very hard to even think about it, because as far as I know it is the boy who usually start flirting with the girl and I am am a boy! hey! i am 18 too and i struggle with this a little bit as well so this might not be the best advice but the way i am working on this right now is by just starting to talk to more girls often, even if you do not want to pursue something romantic.\n\nit really helps if you regularly go to a place where you would meet a lot of people; for me it is college. you could start by just sitting next to a girl in class and strike up a conversation by asking her something about the material and such and go from there. then, you could exchange contacts and once you get friendly with each other, you could ask them if they would like to do something or hang out with you outside of class.\n\nthis was how i met most people my freshman year, not just girls but also guys, and that is how i made most of my friends. you probably might not get into a romantic relationship this way, but it is a start and this helped me become more comfortable talking to people. hope this helps! 23 y/o here. It gets easier, but you got to keep at it.\n\nFirst, I would recommend that you concentrate on improving yourself. What I mean is that you can always improve yourself to get confident. Perhaps working out, picking up a new hobby, read a good book about self-improvement, whatever floats your boat.\n\nGet to new places, either alone or with friends and meet new people there. You can always talk with someone about their hobbies. If you go climbing, you could ask someone to help you, ask them how long they have been climbing etc. Does not have to be a girl to ask, try to get used to talking to other people.\n\nMeet up with some friends and ask them if they want to invite someone along that they know, perhaps they know some cool guys/gals. This can spark friendships, which could develop into a relationship down the line.\n\nKeep in mind, women are just humans too. Try to be normal. Try to take one step at a time. Do not expect too much and be confident in yourself (If you are not, try to act that way. That tricks your brain into being more confident)\n\nI always found that the social game is easier for me, since I am good at remembering stuff about people. Knowing a bit about their hobbies, pets, interests gives you a huge boost!\n\nI would not really recommend dating apps, since they are not very personal (I met my gf there though, so it can work. It took a lot of time though).\n\nYou can always try to go to a disco/party (perhaps not during corona, you know what I mean). The people are in person meeting mode, try to get some eye contact, perhaps they smile at you. That is usually a good sign that they want to talk to you.\n\nAnd while, yes, mostly men initiate conversations, many women initiate conversations too nowadays.\n\nTake care of yourself, brush your teeth and take showers regularly. That puts you in the better 50% I would say. You can always try dating sites if the *approaching* part is hard. The pros of dating sites is that you already know the person is single and you do not have to be thrown into a social situation right away. It helps with getting to know someone before you have to speak to them plus you can tell them that you have SM ahead of time so that they can understand why you might be socially awkward.", "do i chose not to talk ? i think i caused my mutism, at first it was a response to being screamed at by a parent and berated the only way i felt safe was to shut my mouth and pretend i did not exist, then it was when i was i was told to talk about my emotions, i chose to stay silent and not make eye contact, then it was in any situation i found uncomfortable i would simply not speak to avoid it it felt like a choice at first, i know it was a choice but it is somehow become addicting, i stopped speaking one day by choice and it felt like a solution to all my problems but now i feel like i do not have the choice to start speaking again, whenever i try i feel like i cannot breathe, like my voice will not come out, like an invisible hand covers my mouth, i do not know but now all of a sudden it does not feel like my choice to speak or not to speak anymore and i am so lonely because i am in a lot of pain emotionally and stress due to school but i cannot speak to anyone at all anymore, i have lost all my friends and my family is upset and blaming each other, and i feel like i do not even have a minute to breathe because school takes up so much of my time and i always feel like even though i am not talking i have to be a good daughter, and i cannot talk to anyone. Have you tried therapy? Thanks for sharing. Hi love,\n\nI do not think we really \"choose\" to be a selective mute in the sense that other people choose to pick being one thing over another. Selective mutism is not really a choice at all. Selective mutism is a very painful anxiety disorder, and you can forgive yourself, because it was not your fault. The \"addicting\" feeling you describe also makes it sound like we are flawed in some way and we choose not to talk because it is easier for us, like we should just be able to muster up enough courage and get over it.. talk like everyone else. \n\nYou can be a good daughter without communicating verbally. You an be a good friend, a good student and whatever else you want, without talking. \n\nI had my little sister as my \"messenger.\" She did everything for me and never gave me a hard time about it. If we were at a family party, she would speak up for me so I did not have to answer an aunt or uncle's lame question.\n\nI only felt safe with my immediate family.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with you. I know it feels like there is, and I know how lonely you feel. You are going to find people in your life that you can open up to, that you want to talk to. It is going to be hard, but I promise it will change. You will know instinctively who is safe to have a friendship, a relationship with because this entire time you have been studying people.\n\nSelective mutism is not a choice, just like depression or anxiety is not. I hope you find a good therapist.. someone you can confide in. At one time in your life, you knew it was not safe to talk about your feelings. It does not have to stay that way. &lt;3 SM is not a choice. It is the inability to verbalize in some situations.\n\nThat \"invisible hand\" that is covering your mouth is literally the *fight or flight* part of your brain forcing you to not speak. It is an animalistic reaction to anxiety, not a conscious choice by the logical part of your brain.\n\nIf you want to be able to control the part of your brain that is doing that, you will need to train yourself via therapy and exposures. And you will need to educate yourself in why your brain is doing what it is doing. \n\nThis will take time though, so do not expect instant results, and do not beat yourself up about your pace.", "I had selective mutism as a kid and am questioning my adhd diagnoses ?? I was diagnosed w selective mutism in preschool she really experience social anxiety with new people. But I genuinely have not been mute since like second grade. Although I have been rlly quiet in class.\n\nI am diagnosed with adhd now bc I do horrible in school. But I just read a selective mutism PowerPoint. It said selective mutism and adhd are rare together ?? Is the is true ??\n\nIt also said people w selective mutism have a fear of msitakes.. this is so true for me. Like I am always looking for validation or for others to approve me. I also think this effects school. I am horrified to learn new things. I only rlly feel comfortable in a class where I already know the subject fully. Than I can pay attention although it is still hard. I just cannot learn new subjects bc I cannot stop worrying abt what if I am doing things wrong SM and adhd are definitely not rare together. I would say it is fairly common from what I have seen. SM and adhd arent rare together, and even if they were- it would not mean they never show up together. I am unaware of any official stats of the prevalence of adhd and SM, but I myself (used to) have both of them. \n\nIts good you found something that you think fits you though. The line between SM and social anxiety can be thin, so even if you end up not fully feeling like you have SM the resources used for it may still be helpful. Just because it is rare does not mean they are not found together! I did not speak in school and had to be assessed separately from my classmates for reading until the 3rd grade. But I did poorly in school, I did not pay attention and was too afraid to ask for help so I floundered and wish that I had gotten help.\n\nI was never diagnosed as adhd because I was not disruptive in school and it did not occur to me until all the memes to consider that might be my problem too. I figured out a workaround to both my problems and I have become great at problem solving and figuring out how things work on my own. But it is been hard and I have worked harder than most of my peers. Not all cases of selective mutism are so severe that a person is totally unable to speak. Sometimes they can speak fine in certain situations, and some can still reply to questions when under stress, albeit minimally. I am speaking as one of the \"less severe\" cases", "Do employers have to accommodate for SM in the US? ", "Brahms: The Boy II Brahms: The Boy II movie introduces a boy who gets diagnosed with SM! I was shocked to hear the words selective mutism because it is not very known. It is not the best movie but I liked that it introduced SM to a large audience. I saw the first one and loved it, will definitely be watching this soon. This is the worst type of representation possible!!  Although I will say that I liked the first movie, it is really corny but in a good way.\n\nI would just like to take the time to remind anyone who has not been exposed to other SM representaion that Maya Angelou was selectively mute as a child, as she writes on her autobiography and the movie Speak and the book A quiet type of thunder represent SM without the homicide, like most cases of SM in real life.", "I think I have selective mutism. TLDR: Always been mute and socially anxious outside family. Always been talkative and not nervous around family. I think have selective mutism?\n\nThis may be a little rambly, so sorry.\n\nBack in elementary school, I never really spoke. In fact, one of my earliest memories was when I was 4 and I was hiding behind my father whenever I saw kids in public. I always felt nervous talking to people outside my family. Back in Pre-K, I even had trouble asking to use the bathroom and that led to some....accidents.\n\nI was always known as the \"quiet kid\" or \"shy kid\". People always asked me, \"why are you so quiet?\" I also got \"You should talk more\" a lot.\n\nWhile some teachers treated my \"muteness\" with praise (\"Why cannot you be as quiet as xxx? He is such a good student\"), it was sometimes a liability. I would get lower participation grades because I was too nervous to talk. I sometimes got bullied because I was shy.\n\nThis trend continued into middle school (without the bullying) and I was still known as the \"smart, but quiet kid\". Back in 8th grade, I remember that some kids jokingly told me that I should be more social when I go to high school. My art teacher even wrote in my yearbook that I had \"quiet energy\".\n\nDuring that time, I realized that I did not know how to make friends. I grown so accustomed to being alone that I did not really develop any social skills.\nI always felt nervous approaching people and I could not really maintain conversations. I was also afraid of showing emotions. I sometimes even ignored people who approached me out of anxiety.\n\nNow that I am in high school, and I still have some of the same issues I mentioned before. If there is one positive, I am not really known as the \"quiet kid\" since I go to a REALLY BIG school.\nBut I still have trouble talking to people, maintaining conversations and figuring out things to say.\n\nI have gotten better over the years, but I am still feel a bit \"socially backwards\" compared to the rest of my peers. It does not help that I have a stutter and a quiet voice.\n\nBut in my family, it always been the exact opposite. I am incredibly talkative and joke around a lot more than I do in public. And while I do not share everything with my family, I am a lot more open. I wish I could act like this in public, but I never really been able to.\n\nBut just to be sure, do you guys think I have selective mutism? From what you said, you probably had it when you were younger, and may have it now. It is also possible you just have social anxiety disorder, which is quite similar to Selective Mutism. The only difference is people with social anxiety can speak, but feel very nervous/anxious doing so and may sometimes choose to not speak to avoid those feelings. On the other hand, people with selective mutism experience such severe anxiety in certain social settings, like school/work, family gatherings, parties, everyday errands, etc that it causes them to be *unable* to speak. SM is not deliberate. They really want to speak, but they just cannot. It sort of feels like the words are \u201cstuck\u201d. I can form the words in my head, but I just cannot say them no matter how hard I try. And if I try to speak, no sound comes out. My 6 year old son has it and it sounds like you definitely had it as a child. Those are all the same struggles we have had these past two years. He has been doing therapy so I am hoping that first grade is better. It is definitely possible, and at the very least you have a social anxiety disorder. If you have access to it, you should get yourself into some kind of therapy or counseling because that can be hugely helpful. Your mention of bathroom accidents as a kid stuck out to me because I had some similar experiences when I was little (diagnosed SM).", "Could my sister be suffering from selective mutism? My sister (13f), ever since she was in elementary school, never talks with anyone outside of very close friends and family. The only people she talks to in our family are her siblings, my mom, and a few of her cousins who come by only every once in a while. Outside of them, she does not talk to her aunts and uncles, her teachers, her class mates, or even our dad, who we broke up with my mom about 5 years ago.\n\nI feel like an asshole, because I would sometimes tease her about it or be mad that she would not talk to her own dad, who loves her very much but he has gotten used to the silence. It is possible, the characteristics you describe are on the common side from what I have learned here. Nothing beats a doctor's evaluation though, so seeking therapy seems like the next logical step. That teasing can be extremely hurtful though, but it is never too late to stop. The brain changes all the way through life, so you can rebuild whatever was damaged by those comments and things can end well between you two. Obviously, it is a billion times easier now than ever in the future to start that journey, not that it would be easy even now. We likely all feel like assholes about things we did that we did not understand at the time.  It is ok to forgive yourself.  You sound like you are in a reflective mood, which can only mean good things for your sister in the future.  No one on the internet can diagnose your sister, but it sounds like you may have a better understanding of why she is the way she is.", "What is selective mutism? What exactly is selective mutism? I am trying to figure out if I had it as a child and still do now. I understand that it is widely misunderstood and i want to understand. \n\nI was VERY quiet as a child. So much so that teachers had to intervene and Once a day I had to tell them something I liked about school? Lol. But I would speak to friends and family so no one ever really saw it as a problem- I had trouble with \u2018authority figures\u2019 though, like teachers. I would speak when spoken to, but never answer anything in class or initiate conversations. \n\nI grew out of this, but I was still very shy. I have always been known as the shy one. So much so that when I would speak people would do that thing where they act all surprised. \n\nI only came across selective mutism recently because I was googling stuff like \u201cfeeling like I cannot speak in social situations\u201d. It is just a feeling and I can literally? I am not sure if that makes a difference. Sometimes I feel so anxious and stuck in social situations like college classes etc. I will not know what to say (I overthink and overanalyse to the point where anything I say would just sound unnatural, I can get very insecure and unsure of myself). I do not initiate conversations very often at all and I feel rude if I was to interject into one. I have quite severe social anxiety. I understand that selective mutism is a severe form of anxiety? But what I am trying to understand is it the complete inability to speak rather than just feelings of anxiety and awkwardness. I speak when spoken to and if someone asks me a question, but sometimes I do desperately want to talk but my mind either goes totally blank due to overthinking, or I am just too anxious and embarrassed- so I just stay quiet. Is this selective mutism? Feeling completely inhibited when it comes to speaking? Or is selective mutism less \u2018situational\u2019 and more like you will not even speak when someone asks a question?  I am curious. \n\nThank you :) Selective mutism is a severe anxiety disorder (thought to be a more severe form of social anxiety) where the sufferer freezes in certain situations (school, work etc) when there is an expectation to speak. For me, my throat feels like it is constricted or tight, and no matter how hard I try the words just do not come out. I can form the words in my head, but they do not come down to my mouth. Other times, I am so anxious I cannot even form the words in my head, let alone speak. \n\nNo two cases of selective mutism are alike. It tends to vary. Some people with SM may be able to initiate, but not respond to questions, while others may *not* be able to initiate, but can respond to questions. My throat flares up too! I feel like I have to clear it. If I get really anxious I feel physically constricted. I can still talk but I will not really know what to say if I am that anxious and I will likely fall over my words - prefer not to initiate in case I mess my words up and make a bad impression. I am not sure if it is selective mutism (because I could still speak if I tried, I am just anxious so I do not want to embarrass myself or I do not know way to say/overthinking. I am under the impression that SM is not a choice?) or I am just really really anxious and inhibited. \n\nThanks for your answer ! Selective mutism is not a choice, it is a matter of being unable to speak due to anxiety. \nTo me, it sounds like you might just have severe social anxiety disorder, but I am not a professional, so I would suggest seeing your doctor. For me I am 17 male)\n\nI know exactly what I want to say and cannot say it like I will try and physically nothing is happening there is no sound coming out and that is when I start to panic. And get more nervous\n\nHappens when I am anxious which is Alot even though I am an extrovert and fine making eye contact or talking to people 1v1. Ah I see! Thank you for this insight. Also interesting that you are an extrovert with SM. Does that make it more frustrating do you think? Thanks! Yes I see the difference. I can chose to speak if I want to. But I am usually frozen with anxiety - but if I did want to - I physically could. That is where the difference lies I guess? Thanks for educating me. I know I have severe anxiety &amp; an currently working through it. Yea , it is gotten better over the years but no one knows I have it besides my parents who probably caused this by stress and terrible parenting to this day.\n\n. When I am with friends or someone I do not feel as stressed almost 100% of the time. Occasionally the problem comes up where I will know what I want to say and i have to use different words or not say it.\n\nI have problems ordering at fast food drive thru's and calling on the phone or talking to anyone older than me (basically anymore who I am not close with including my parents).\n\nBut no I am not really nervous talking to people I am nervous because I am probably not going to be able to talk to the person I am talking to.\n\nAnd it is basically just a cycle of being nervous about speaking then I cannot speak because I am nervous.  But no it is not a choice and not many people even know it is a thing because I guess only a small amount of people have it. Ah i see. I also have the problem of not knowing what to say and if I do, scrambling my words or staying quiet. \n\nI find it hard to make friends because I am so shy and anxious. Before even speaking to people I have this subconscious feeling of being \u2018unworthy\u2019. I cannot do phone calls (in my head, I literally can but I will feel so awkward) and I have never even ordered through a drive thru for that reason. I have a problem or have had problems with so called \u2018authority figures\u2019 anyone older than me. Again I think it is more subconscious. I do not see anyone as better or worse than me. \n\nI get the nervous about speaking and then not speaking because I am nervous! It is a lovely cycle. I find it easier, like much easier to initiate conversations with quieter people. I recently left a friend group for various reasons and that is knocked my confidence tenfold. \n\nHow come not many people know or realise you have it? Is it like if someone asks you a question you cannot answer? No one knows besides my parents because it does not really happen if I am just talking with friends anymore. I do not think about it when I am talking with friends or people my age. And I am normally not as anxious unless I am talking to someone I do not know like teachers  or any adults. Or anyone on the phone.\n\n But occasionally   I will want to say something and I can feel that I am not going to be able to say it so I have to try to use different words or not say anything.\n\nThen on phone calls, I cannot speak and I know exactly what I want to say it is like normally I would talk but I guess I will try and my throat will not make any sounds.  So phone  calls and fast food thru's are the worse.\n\nAnd I am very extroverted and not nervous with the idea of making eye contact or talking on the phone, I get nervous because I fear that SM will happen and I will not be able to talk even when I am trying and know what I want to say. \n\nI went on vacation without my parents for a week and was Alot less stressed and my SM almost disappeared. Then we came and it was the same as normal. I get more nervous sometimes now talking to people my age. It is all subconscious so I cannot tackle it head on I feel. \n\nSometimes I am even alright talking to people I do not know because I will likely never see them again. I really relate to the bit about wanting to say something but cannot Because I get nervous. Also sometimes my voice changes depending on who I am talking to lol. Not sure why\n\nI am not extroverted but eye contact is fine until I realise I am making it and I overthink it. I think Because I have OCD as well. It is very understandable that you get nervous about SM. Why do you think it went away on holiday? Same, Im not sure what exactly I can do to stop it from happening. It does not happen if I do not think about it for the most part. But I am always thinking about it. \n \nNot sure about the voice change thing possibly just nervousness.\n\nMy parents stress out me and trigger it, so I guess I vacation I was not as stressed without them being there. Overthinking is my problem - it causes my anxiety. I do it even without realising. I find my best and most successful interactions are when I stop overthinking. That is where the problem lies I think. It is frustrating because I know I am capable. Overthinking makes me socially inept lol. \n\nI see, do you spend a lot of time with your parents? On the bright side at least you know the cause/source. People with SM can physically speak, it is just that they are at a point where they cannot make a choice to do so due to the severity of their anxiety. It is a complete inability, but not a physical inability, if that makes sense. From what I have gathered one if the core features of SM is situationality; you are comfortable speaking in certain situations, but unable to in others. But it can vary from person to person.  \n\nBeing unable to speak situationally is not necessarily permanent, though; there are therapies that can successfully address SM. It sounds like you have severe social anxiety and I think you could benefit from some sort of anxiety-focused therapy such as CBT whether or not you have full blown SM. I am sorry you are struggling with anxiety, good luck dealing with it. Im 17 Mand the only time I spend with my dad is 7 mins in morning before I leave for school and about 30-40 eating dinner talking about whatever is on tv or I will not say Anything sometimes. And my mom was living In a different state after my parents got.divorced at 8 till about 15 years old and I see her about 1.5x a month she lives 30 mins away now. For me, it feels like there is something in my throat that is blocking my talking", "I (17F) have had SM since I was 4. Now, I am about to graduate high school and will soon have my first (part-time) job. So how does this work? Hello, I guess I am here for a variety of reasons\u2014to share my life story, offer consolation to others who also have SM, and to ask for advice. I hope you will take the time to read this, and that you will be understanding of my situation.\n\n-\n\nI was four years old. Frankly, I was actually 22 days too young to be in Kindergarten, but they allowed me to enroll anyways due to the already small-class sizes. The first day of school was horrifying. I sat on a large blue (?) rug, bawling my eyes out along with a dozen other kids surrounding me. Within 10 minutes or so, most have calmed down. Not me, though. I was terrified, my dad was nowhere in sight, and I had no idea what was going on. I did not talk. I never spoke.\n\nThat is the reputation I had: \"The girl who does not talk.\"\n\nIt persisted for a few years, both in- and out-of- school. Close family members and distant relatives all wondered why I never uttered a word to them. Still, I was an outgoing child. At school, I was popular amongst my peers and had many friends.\n\nStill, the nonverbal thing was getting out of hand. I think I was in the third grade when I first saw a therapist; I do not remember much about her, aside from the fact that she was nice and always played with me. She mentioned that her mom and I had the same name (I do not know why I remembered that). She had some contract, though, and it ended. I had to get a new therapist. The new one was awkward, and I was much less comfortable around her. No progress.\n\nI soon moved across the country with my dad and his new wife (my biological parents got divorced when I was around 2-3 years old). I lived there for 2 years, during my 5th grade and 6th grade years. I moved back home to my biological mom the day after 6th grade ended.\n\nI did not get treatment. I stayed mute. The last two of my middle school years were plagued by anxiety and depression.\n\nHigh school is... okay. The first semester of freshman year sucked, but the second semester was great. I broke out of my shell, and was finally able to muster the confidence to wave to my friends and smile! Before that, I developed a habit of always covering the bottom half of my face with my hand. I always wore long-sleeves, even when it got unbearably hot.\n\nSophomore year sucked. I decided to be partially-homeschooled, so I only had to go to school twice a week for one-hour each (once to see a teacher who will check up on my progress, and once for a Chemistry lab class). I did the rest of my work at-home.\n\nI stayed home a lot more and the depression returned. I wanted to go back to public school to see my friends again. I did not go back until junior year. At the same time, though, I was extremely self-confident in my appearance (as a sophomore). I constantly donned shorts and t-shirts, experimented with my style, and would not hesitate to smile during the hot spring, summer, and fall months (yes, global warming got our seasons all messed up).\n\nStill, mute. The summer after my sophomore year is very memorable. I discovered that I could speak to strangers, as long as my closest family members (by blood/birth, not by friendship/familial-personal-relationship) were not in the vicinity; this is mostly attributed to the fact that strangers do not have the expectation of mutism from me as strangers, and that my family members do not intimidate me.\n\nI am a senior year now. An extremely social family friend of mine invited me to an event for one of her school clubs. It was held at an amusement park during public hours, so there was quite the crowd. I was introduced to countless people (who I would not be able to recognize today, due to the briefness of our meeting and the day's hecticity). I was often stopped by complete strangers who wanted to know what event was going on. I was able to explain without stuttering or feeling anxiety!\n\nI cannot talk at school (unless it is to this one guy who I met in freshman year, and who today is still one of my most cherished friends), nor can I to MOST of my family, but I could at least talk to people I have never met before! This gave me hope. I planned for college and I know what I will be when I grow up.\n\nToday, as I am mere weeks away from graduation, I hope to soon get my first job. I have confidence in myself that I can do it as long as I do not meet anyone I know.\n\nAs of right now, I have no hope for talking to people who know me as the \"quiet girl\", but that is okay. I will get to that someday, when I am ready.\n\nI am sure that someday you, too, will be able to make these strides like me. Baby steps, everyone, baby steps. Take the time you need to improve! After all, this is something you have probably had for as long as I have, perhaps even longer! It is not going to be easy, and even making the decision to get better requires immense courage, but I believe you can do it. I believe in you!!\n\nAnd I am proud. I am proud of you for fighting all this time. Sometimes even living, or breathing, gets hard. That is okay. Take your time. I am proud of you. I applaud you for all this time you have endured, fighting little and big fights alone. I am proud.\n\n-\n\nAhh... Now here is a little change in tone!! I would like to ask you all, preferably from those who are older and have experience, how you may have improved your condition. What did you do and how? Tell me a little about yourself, your life!! I want to get to know you and your achievements, failures too. Perhaps if we can share our stories, we can slowly overcome this together!\n\nWhat do ya say? Are you with me?\n From one stranger to another, I am super proud of you too! That makes me curious about whether you would be mute if a stranger knew about your SM, for example a therapist? Or if hypothetically, you met me in person, knowing that I know your condition.\n\nYour story reminds me of someone else's, who overcame mutism in school by changing to a completely new school where no one knew her. She made the decision herself and had the conviction to push herself to speak on day 1. It totally works for some people. Totally agreed, I think the simplest solution for treatment of SM is simply changing the living environment to a whole new one where no one around him or her knows about his or her SM.\n\nWe SM people need a push to come out of our shell and those who know us acts as step back for us...\n\nI been in this shell since very early childhood and still not being able to come out of it despite reaching in early 25s...\n\n\nWent to a psychiatrist for treatment but left when he said we will have no option but to ECT you...\n\nNow I am confused like what to do... It is a hard road to walk and you will likely struggle with it for a long time to some degree. I have had my moments in school where I opened up because there were people there that did not know me or know about me being \u201cthe quiet one.\u201d \n\nWhen I started working after college, I was nervous and my anxiety about working for the first time and dealing with new situations put me back in that position of being quiet again. Do not be afraid to admit to your mistakes and admit to things you do not know. It helps to laugh at yourself and not take everything too seriously. You will have awkward social moments, but you will get better with time. If you have a SM feeling coming up and you think of not speaking or avoiding someone, think about if future you will regret it or not. \n\nI am 32 now and have missed out on a lot of great experiences and people because of my SM. I have a job now that does not foster collaboration (everyone just sits in their own cubicle and no one really speaks to each other) and it is made my SM resurface a little more, so I am looking for somewhere else that does. I think jobs that have a healthy team dynamic are good for people trying to overcome SM. I am pretty sure ECT is only supposed to be used in extreme and debilitating cases of anxiety after exhausting *every single* other possible form of treatment. If I were you I would stay away from this psych and find someone who is more knowledgable about anxiety disorders and their treatment.\n\nPersonally, my SM was treated at a residential program through CBT and exposure therapy. A good next step for you might be to try to find a therapist who is able to work on CBT and exposure therapy with you. A good therapist should give you the tools to get you out of your shell and help boost your confidence. Best of luck on your journey.", "Do I Have SM? I know there are quite a few other posts asking, but I am kind of curious about stuff that is been happening to me.\n\nBefore I continue, I have gone through really bad trauma before and after that I have become !more quiet each year. I also have difficulties talking to people, even over text. Calling is something I despise. I have disorders such as ADHD, Autism, Depression, Anxiety, and possibly more that could be undiagnosed. My Anxiety is also so bad, I usually feel sick when leaving the house and feel like vomiting when I have to talk.\n\nLately, as in the past few weeks (or months(I have not really kept track of time)), I have been more unable to talk; especially to people I do not know or not very close to. When I try to talk, it hurts. Usually, it will feel like my throat is full of cotton balls, packing peanuts, animal bedding, or other items similar. I do not exactly know how to describe the feeling exactly as it feels.\n\nEven if it hurts, I keep trying to the point where I make weird sounds. For example, I will try to say \u201chello\u201d and make an odd sound instead. Even today in class, my teacher called on me and I tried to say \u201chere,\u201d but I made a weird \u201cere\u201d sound quietly and just raised my hand instead.\n\nMy throat has been in almost constant pain for at least over 3 weeks. I am making stupid decisions to keep on talking, but I do not want to be seen as weird, especially to my family since they will probably say I need to talk more for this to go away. Or put me on Anti-Depressants, since that seems like their go-to.\n\nCurrently, the only people I can talk to is family (sometimes it does hurt to talk though), close friends or people I know very well, and well, I can usually speak to people when I need help or am asking a question, but I usually talk very quietly. So, I can talk to close people more, family a bit less, and strangers (when I or they need help) even less.\n\nTruthfully, I feel like I am faking it, even though I am not. It is so bad I cannot even talk to myself or pets in private. I do need some help figuring out if this is SM or not. I know I should probably tell my parents or doctor, but I just want at least a little help so I do not end up messing things up. And I especially do not want to waste money to find out I am just quiet.\n\nI feel like I am making it sound like I am scared of becoming SM, but I am not really. I am just really scared the people I know will think less of me or be disappointed.\n\nSorry if some things are written badly or not enough was written down because I tried to write this as quick as possible.

Sometimes when I am in school I can not speak, I can not ask the teacher for information or ask permission to drink water. And I try to speak, but no sound comes out and when it comes out it is very low. Sometimes I have asked other people to talk to the teachers for me, because I just could not verbalize a word. I do not know if this is selective mutism or just a very strong anxiety. While your self described symptoms seem to line up, we are not professionals and cannot diagnose you properly. We cannot know if you have any other underlying issues or such, which is why it is important that you meet a professional.  From your description it does sound like SM Thank you for your words. It is nice to know that there are places where people understand me.", "I go mute with my boyfriend and it caused us to end the relationship, but now we are back together and I want to be better. Mainly just a rant\n\nAs the title says, I go mute with him. I want to say it and my mouth does not move. I am getting better but it is still hard. I can barely say \u201cI love you\u201d and I have issues with showing affection verbally and physically so that does not help. The physical thing is something I am working on too. But the verbal is harder because it is like my mouth is locked or the output from the my brain was closed off. I want to say things and I guess I get nervous. I do not really say what I want and go along with what other people want because I do not want to inconvenience them. This has caused me to go on with what he wants, which is not bad necessarily but I want to be able to talk. He is the person I feel most comfortable with and he is the first person I have ever been this comfortable with. I have been able to talk to him more than anyone. Yet there are simple things I have trouble saying. \nI know it is small steps and stuff. I just needed to get it out. \n\nOh and I said \u201cI love you\u201d first tonight and that made me happy. This sound more like social anxiety than selective mutism. You should ask this same question there I mean I definitely have social anxiety, but I think it is sm. I get uncomfortable showing affection and when I am uncomfortable I go mute. I am getting better with my sm though so maybe it is just social anxiety. Thank you Selective mutism makes you unable to think when you are trying to have a conversation which makes you end up quiet with an empty head, social anxiety is when you are nervous to say things on your mind etc...  I do get an empty head sorry I guess I did not completely understand you or say it right. My thoughts will disappear, like my brain is being blocked. Like it just does not make the thoughts or words. So like I know the feeling I want to express but cannot verbalize it and sometimes freeze up.  Im the same as you then :S right now im losing someone important aswell because i have a retarded brain that shuts down when it should not Yeah :( I have gotten better by challenging myself to one small step at a time and it is helped some. Otherwise writing it down before I get in the situation and then reading it. Some breathing techniques work occasionally depends on the day.  I used to believe these things help, then i realized that the only thing that really helped me was alcohol... i had meds prescribed but they were good for nothing :/ sad part is that sm can only be cured during childhood by good parenting and there is really no way to fight it", "Any high school freshmen here?  might want to repost this more specific as to what you want with the people here", "Problem with my mom So I do not have selective mutism but there are not really any places where I could post this\n\n\nSince may I am unable to talk because of mental reasons. I cannot talk to anyone, not even to my family. I was also not really talkative before that. Mostly I only talked a few words or sentences a day and I almost never started conversations. Mostly I only talked when people asked me questions\n\n\nMy mom is very talkative. She can talk for half hour. One simple thing can take her 10 sentences to describe, when it could be done in 1. But when I write her a few words she starts to complain and you can really see on her that she does not really want to read what I wrote. I have to listen to her talking for 10-20-30 minutes but I cannot even write a few sentences without my mom complaining... \n\n\nThat is why I only write when it is really necassary. Not only verbal communication is impossible, but nonverbal is also really hard. And it have been like that for half a year so that she doesnt get used to it yet is not an excuse\n\n\nMy mom also makes me feel gulity. She says how cruel I am that I do not say hi back to my brothers. She says I make everyone sad and she will die or have a heart attack\n\n\nSometimes she tries to force me to speak. She comes really close to me and says repeteadly \"speak! speak! speak!\" \"Say mom!\" Which just makes me not wanting to speak even more\n\n\nAnd sometimes my notebook is taken away, so I cannot write anything back but I have to listen.

I was diagnosed with selective mutism ever since I was about 7.. I went to 3 primary schools and 1 secondary school, in my first primary school I spoke normal-ish, to my classmates, to the teachers I spoke but not very often but I still did. On my second school I did not speak until a year, one day I just spoke, my friends told me I had an adorable voice, and I spoke more and more.. I never spoke a word to some teachers, but I remember one which I would whisper to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we moved to a smaller school, it was nice even tho I missed my friends. I spoke on the second day there, and later kind of really quietly whispered a few words to my teachers! Except I spoke in this weird voice, I cannot remember but I bet I started doing this voice in my previous school, try sounding like a baby, yeah, that was my voice. It was not really that high-pitched, it was more baby-like.. Again I was told my voice was adorable, so it did not really bother me. But I never had any proper conversations and always acted immature. I would do anything to make my friends laugh at me if it was to eat a LEAF or food off the FLOOR. I know, disgusting.. But it made them laugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to my secondary school, things were not that different, I spoke on maybe my second week, I had an autistic friend and she told me to say 'banana' I said it and everyone was surprised because I did not speak before, and I was happy because I had new friends because of it. I hanged around them and continued to say banana.. They would ask me literally anything 'BANANA' that is the only thing I could say- I hate it I hate it I cannot stop saying it. It is like my word now to escape answering any questions or participating in conversations. I want to talk to them I want to be funny, not annoying. I want to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey told me to eat food off the floor and I actually did it, they all laughed and I did too, finally, they liked me. I continued to do it, and get more gross. Once I bited into a f\\*\\*\\*ing apple from the floor, I was gross, they kind of liked it until it just got plain annoying, so I stopped. They hate me now.. What do I do? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and there was this one girl that liked to kick me but when I kicked her back she would scream like she was in pain, I did not kick her that hard too. She was also smiling and laughing sometimes when I kicked her so I thought she was just joking. Sometimes her kicks actually hurt and gave me bruises but I pretended they did not hurt. She would sometimes write things like 'Crybaby' on my hand when we watched a move, acting like she saw me crying, I was never an emotional person. She would just grab my hand and scribble 'crybaby' on it. That made me feel upset and that is why I nearly cried. I am sensitive, but sad movies do not bother me, especially not a boring educational one about slaves. She did much more stuff but most of the time she would just say things like '\\ is acting! She talks to me. She is just pretending to not speak so she does not have to do this work.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe left. I thought it would be over, I thought my friends would like me now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother girl joined. I will call her 2. She did not like me for some reason, she turned everyone against me. I do not want to get into it because this is long enough but she would say things like, 'Go away freak', 'F\\*ck off' , 'Go kill yourself'. She made everyone call me a freak, she made everyone call me names, she ruined my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe also left to go to another school.. I do not know what I did, but maybe this time I would finally be happy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, another girl we were hanging out with suddenly started hurting me. She would say things like 'You look like momo when you smile' (Everyone agreed.), when she called me a freak, everyone agreed. They all told me to f\\*\\*k off multiple times. We do not have a big school. They are my only choice.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuarantine and I am alone. I like it, I am not excited for school. But I feel so alone. Is something wrong with me?

So this video was taken when I was around 5 or 6, and I just turned 27 a few days ago. I am doing much better now although I would not say that I have fully recovered from SM- I still experience shutdowns when I am extremely anxious but luckily that is very rare now. I have pretty severe social/generalized anxiety that effects my daily living and quality of life, but I am in therapy learning how to manage it and work through it. :) My daughter was diagnosed when she went to kindergarten and it was the same.

I only talk around my sister, 2 or 3 close friends, and my parents, although I usually avoid it. I do not talk in school, I only said a few sentences in school last year. I have a decent amount of friends, but I mostly communicate through one or two words.   People usually have to ask me questions for me to talk to them, and even then I could only communicate through a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d. I have a hard time talking to people online. I make Reddit posts and that is about it, I do not make comments unless it is a question asking several people, and even then I avoid it.

What is up guys I am 22F and basically a low quality hermit due to various diagnoses of depression, anxiety, ADD, a couple of severe phobias and bad lower body bones/joints. \n\n\nAnyway I was talking to my therapist, which is only possible as I have been seeing her for almost 7 years and also she let us me bring my dog to our sessions. \n\n\nAnyway she diagnosed me with possible selective mutism at 15 due to the fact that I cannot speak to anyone other than my father, boyfriend, and brothers. And also because cases in teens/adults are so rare and I have a couple other mental health disorders that it could be related to. Thing is, as a kid,  before the age of like 10, I was apparently a talkative kid (according to my mother) then one day I just could not talk to anyone anymore. My therapist says this might be related to a trauma but I have no memory prior to age 10, it is hard to determine lol. \n\n\nHOWEVER, I can write messages to people with ease and due to therapy I can now complete a few conversations as long they have a \"script\" and there is ZERO deviation from either parties lines. \n\n\nAnyway just wanted to hear yalls opinion on writing with SM do other people do it? I understand if not, I usually write out the way I think the conversation is going to go before I meet the people and I never write to someone if someone else is waiting to be helped. I write scripts before things such as phone calls or meetings just to kind of outline things I could say. I also find writing in general MUCH easier than speaking. Memory loss and sudden onset of selective mutism is likely due to physical or emotional trauma and assuming your therapist is in any way competent, they will be utilising trauma informed practices in your therapy.\n\nSelective mutism impacts expressive communication. It is rarely tied physically to your vocal cords or specific nerves or muscles related to speaking. It is a symptom of the way you think. Prior to the internet and digital communication in text being a primary communication means - it was super rare for SM to show any examples of indication in writing. Sign languages, written communication and communication through picture books were common therapeutic work around a.\n\nIt is increasingly prevalent in clinical practice to hear lived experience accounts of SM applying to written communication as well. Culturally, it sits in a very similar place in our brain to spoken expressive communication.\n\nDuring bad periods for my SM, writing messages to people is super problematic. Writing on Reddit or in a blog post or something is much easier because it does not feel like a conversation in my head. ", "I need help This is a throwaway account I just made cause I have family that can see my main account.\nMy case of SM is getting worse and I am unable to ask for help from anyone.\nI have had SM for as long as I can remember, I am almost certain it came from my dad's actions as a younger child but no need to go into that.\nWhen I was 12, my case starting getting really bad so my mum took me to see a therapist, I could not say a single word and therefore was obviously useless, so the she took me to my school councillor whom I also didnt speak to once, also making it worse. At this time my dad was getting really angry that I was starting to stop being able to speak to family, and starting shouting at me, threatening to throw me out of the car unless I spoke (would have been a 7 mile walk home) but I managed to say something. Obviously this just made me even worse, my parents realised that this wasnt working so they gave me space and eventually I was able to start talking to then again and I thought I was getting better up until late last year when I started a new school (I am now 16). Not many of my friends who I was comfortable talking to changed school with me, and most of those who did started drifting apart so I was forced to either be alone or make new friends, which is very difficult for me. I managed to make about 2 friends somehow (if I start small with stuff like answering somebody is question I can sometimes force myself to become comfortable with them) but still I was spending most of my time completely alone, and I was starting to get suicidal thoughts seeing as it isnt possible for me to make friends, and at this point I had not spoken to anyone in ages, but occasionally I would see some of my old friends on the train, which would make me excited at first until I realized that I could not talk to them. When I had to do something such as a school trip where I would have to talk to people I would start to feel really sick, to the point where I would be on the toilet for hours. This brought back the suicidal thoughts and made things so much worse. I could not talk to old friends, I could not make new friends, I could not tell my family about it, I cannot tell my own mother that i love her, my brain just wont allow me to, i cant swear, there is a whole list of seemingly insignificant words that I cant say, I have no way of getting help as I am unable to ask. Since covid, I have left my house to see friends twice, both times I was almost unable to go due to the previous mentioned sickness before having to talk to people. I am feeling suicidal again and I have no idea what to do to stop it. I am so sorry, that sounds agonisingly hard. \n\nYou are very eloquent in writing, so I wonder if you could start therapy with a counselor prepared to work with you writing to them, maybe using messenger if that feels ok.\n\nYou could book a drs appointment and take a print out of your worries and a phone or something to type replies on. If you are in crisis, which it sounds like you might be, now might be a time to consider some anti depressants/antibl anxiety medication. I am definitely not saying it will do everything, but I found it helpful alongside weekly counseling when I was having strong suicidal ideation.\n\nKeep on checking in here for support, and see if you can keep in touch with old friends by messenger/Skype to keep those friendships going. I think this is very wise advice and I wish you the best OP! Do you have any idea how I could get a counselor without anyone finding out? Dont try to go through this alone. Find someone. I would recommend searching for something like:\n\nFree counseling instant messenger \n\nAnd your country.\n\nMore services are moving to text rather than phone.\n\nDo you have any diagnosis? Eg if you are diagnosed as autistic there may be particular groups that are funded to help young people.\n\nIn terms of your communication strategies, it sounds like it would be useful for you to see a speech and language therapist, in the UK your GP could refer you and your parents would not find out (unless they posted your appointment to your home address, but you could ask for that not to happen.\n\nIf you hit a dead end, reply here with some details and I will help you to search.\n\nPlease let me know how you get on xx", "Verbal communication difficulties with people who I able to talk at school If someone who you can communicate verbally with 100% fluently force to or manipulate you or coerce or puts pressure on you to talk to him/her, do you experience fight-or-flight response?

I could go up to the teacher and ask for help, It scared me but it didnt feel impossible. Why I do not think I have recovered is because I cant talk to crowds or do presentations, I just cant do them, I can only do it with a teacher.

I just feel like if I started talking it would be super awkward, Its terrifying to imagine the reaction of everyone at Christmas if I randomly said something. And if I am honest I think my relatives have given up on ever hearing me speak, they probably do not even care about me... The way I have seen it is you are recovered when you can speak fully/without restriction in all settings too all people. So technically, you are not recovered yet but you are almost there, since you are somewhat verbal by the sounds of it. I would suggest to try to speak whenever you can. The more you do exposure exercises, the easier it gets. Just remember: take baby steps. I have a younger cousin who has SM she cant speak to most of my family.. I am trying to learn more so that I can continue to encourage her mother to find her help and not ignore the situation or assume she will grow out of it. Could you maybe begin with someone in your family who makes you feel most safe? I am sure your grandparents would love to hear from you the awkwardness is not worth the regret. What exactly are you terrified about? Is it that you are afraid you will be boring or do not know where to begin to have a conversation? \n\n\\-honestlycaringandcurious", "Is this how anyone else feels?

This will be through the NHS, and through COVID times I expect the process will take a long time, in the meantime, can anyone help give some advice on how best to help her?\n\n Full version:  My soon to be 6 year old has always been quite withdrawn around people she is not familiar with.  My wife was always of the opinion that she would grow out of it, and that she is just a bit shy.  However, I always felt there was an underlying reason\n for it, and rather than improving, she appears to have regressed.  Neither my wife or I had heard of SM before, but after a lot of research online, it at least appears to be the closest match to her symptoms.\n\n When she is at home and around family/people she is familiar with, she is talkative, easily expresses emotions, likes to sing &amp; dance etc.  If we are out in a shop, park, cafe etc and someone speaks to her, she outright pretends they are not there and pretty much never responds.  Even at a cafe we have been gong to regularly for years, the staff always try to speak to her in a very friendly manner, and despite being quite familiar with them, she will not respond.\n\n What started off as her ignoring people when encountering these situations, gradually progressed to her making strange expressions, typically looking up to the ceiling whilst opening and closing her mouth.  And in recent months she started to literarily scream when someone speaks to her, and immediately turning around and clinging onto my leg.  I feel we maybe partly responsible for making things worse, due to putting under pressure to respond to people, because we viewed it as being rude/bad manners.\n\n I first spoke to my daughter about it a few months back, and she was very reluctant to talk about it.  She is recently opened up to me about it, I suspect this breakthrough has come from me trying to show some understanding, and reassuring her that she does not have to speak and that we love her no matter what.  What she has told me, in her words are that she gets very scared when strangers speak to her, and she cannot explain why.  She says she wants to talk, but she just cannot, and at school she will only speak\n to teachers if she really has to.\n\n It is quite upsetting to see sometimes, when she talks about how excited she is to go to a party yet when she gets to the party she freezes.  I play a lot of football (soccer to you Americans!) with her and she plays well with me, yet when I take her to football\n training she finds it hard to communicate with the coach &amp; other children, she becomes withdrawn and therefore does not show what she is capable of.\n\n With all of this said, I kind of feel as though I can sympathise her as I think I may have a mild form of SM myself.  I was outgoing as a kid, but from my mid teens onwards I have found it increasingly difficult to express my voice freely around large groups.  I\n can speak to people on a professional basis, but when around unfamiliar people on a social level, my voice seems to tighten and I cannot tell jokes or speak in an expressive tone.  Maybe I have passed this on to her?\n\nTo finish off, I just want to make it clear that I do not feel any disappointment, she brings so much joy to my life and I just want to help her as best as I can to prepare her for adolescence and adulthood.   I would like to have some input from anyone who may\n be able to advise on whether or not it sounds like SM, and how I should help her in the meantime before we have some professional help.  Thank you to anyone who made it this far! Sounds exactly like I was when I was younger. It really does sound like SM. Outgoing and perfectly fine at home but shy and will not talk to other people you do not know. Go to an SM specialist. I am constantly amazed at how many young adults online just find out about it in adulthood and are so affected by it at 20+ still.\nI went to a specialist when I was young and got that help that all kids with SM should get at that age. Sadly not all do and it really shows. Thanks for tour reply, much appreciated.  So we are you able to completely overcome SM through the help of a specialist? Mostly. I am still shyer/calmer and reserved than most people but I do not get anxiety or scared by speaking to people or anything. I am probably a little awkward though sometimes although some of that could be from my hearing cause it kind of sucks haha.\n\nAs for now I would say, normalise it?\nI do not remember why I stopped speaking but I know why I was scared to speak. It was the reactions from everyone else if I was to speak. Being mute for so long, once you speak everyone would make a big deal of it and freak out.\nOne of the things I had to do before class every now and then was sit in the classroom with mum and a friend and have the teacher at the door. I would find it hard to speak because the teacher was nearby but eventually over time I got used to it and the teacher could come closer and I guess I slowly learned it was not a big deal to speak. Really pleased to hear you have mostly overcome SM, and it is very encouraging to hear that it is treatable.  Thanks for the advice too \ud83d\udc4d Could the screaming be an outlet for feeling extreme emotions? \n\nOP, does she ever say the places you go are too loud? It is nearly impossible for me to get the words together to speak if my brain is inundated with noise. Just an idea. Yeah, I was like that except instead of screaming sometimes I would be frustrated to the point of tears. The words just would not come out.\n\nI was very disinterested in talking to most other people and by the time I realized I wanted to talk to people, I could not.\n\nI kind of lucked out with a few friends who did not let that stop them from being my friend and started making efforts when I wanted to work.\n\nI did discover it was inhibition related when I was incredibly sick and gave the best speech of my life. Hmm, I was thinking the noise thing was plausible, but then I remembered a time in a quiet park when a lady asked her what her name was (in a very friendly tone) and she screamed, turned away and cling onto my leg.\n\nIt is possible that she was engrossed in her own imaginary world (she often makes up imaginary scenarios and pretends she is a teacher, pop star, princess etc) playing on the climbing frame at the time, and the lady speaking to her abruptly took her out of that zone.  The screaming thing is a difficult one to comprehend \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Sorry to hear that.  The more I hear about SM the more I feel as though I have similar symptoms myself, just much milder form - if that is even possible!\n\nSeems as though you have made some progress in overcoming it to some extent? Oh, I could see that.  My son is on the spectrum, and though he does not have SM, he gets engrossed in his thought processes, and has a very difficult time with interruptions.  He also will only rarely speak to someone he does not know.\n\nI am so glad you are supportive of your daughter.  I had SM as a child, and my mom was always trying to get me to talk to strangers who talk to me, and if I did not (surprise, that was most of the time), she would explain to the person that I was backwards.  A lot of people who have SM can speak easier when they get older, or have assistance in figuring out how to manage. That sounds awful, I think we have also been guilty of that to an extent though.  Not by describing her as backwards but we have told people numerous times that she is very shy, in an attempt to excuse what they may see as rudeness.  Unfortunately overtime we have probably unintentionally compounded her belief that she is \u2018different\u2019 or somehow not good enough.  We have atleast seen the error of our ways and not making a big deal of it these days. Thanks for your replies \ud83d\udc4d I have described my son as shy too, and honestly, he was glad there was a word for it that could describe the feelings he felt.  Shy is a normal variation of the human experience.  \"Backward\" was the word used for people who were not neurotypical when I was growing up.  Lol, I knew I experienced my world differently than most people, though backward was not a correct descriptor.  It took me until age 46 to figure out a better word:  neurodiverse.  Good luck to you. You have described my own daughter perfectly. She is nearly 5 and has always been ill at ease with strangers and slow to make friends. Before the pandemic I felt we were making progress. She had 3 friends she would play with after having arranged one on one play dates with them countless times. She had one friend at school. But since the pandemic she has regressed so much. She will not talk to her friends anymore. If a stranger talks to her or even comes too close she will run away crying. She is even stopped talking to her grandmother and her cousins who we meet quite often. \n\n\nI would love to hear what kind of treatments you are following and are having success with. Sort to hear that.  We first discovered what selective mutism about a month ago, so we are just trying to be supportive at this moment in time.  We have not yet had any professional help, so until that happens I cannot give any success stories yet.  If and when we make progress I will update you on this thread \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAre you in the UK by any chance? I am in the US. At the moment I am also just trying to be supportive. But at the same time not shielding her from uncomfortable situations. I want to still push her a little and celebrate small victories. For example the other day after much persuading she talked in front of a friend to me. I still had to talk for her but atleast she spoke to me while her friend could hear. I praised her a lot for that and gave her a small prize. My husband says it is just a phase and she will outgrow it once we send her back to school. Hi Luke, to add some uk solidarity to the thread my 4 year old daughter has SM. It was not particularly on our radar, with what we would considered shyness with family she does not see often. Since starting school it was apparent there was a full on and conscious lockdown. She came out one day and said \u201coh good I can talk now\u201d within earshot of the teacher which was the first time the teacher had heard her speak. We have got to a point of very quiet whispering to the teacher so long as no one can hear - she does not want her friends to hear her even... We need to pursue additional support to help her as soon as possible. Thanks for commenting, sorry to hear your daughter seems to have similar issues.  Atleast you seem to be aware of it earlier than we were.  We are on a long waiting list for a specialist via the NHS.. our GP was actually very understanding and a lot more knowledgeable about SM than I first expected.  \n\nI plan to update this thread as and when we get to the stage of seeing a specialist.", "If you have SM, do you also have issues learning certain skills because of anxiety? I am trying to evaluate my situation and it seems that I was not able to learn certain skills like biking or swimming because I was too embarrassed to make mistakes and happens even today. I suspect that this symptom of anxiety is closely related to fear or judgment or being seen (often comes with social anxiety). I would often practice or learn certain skills in private and when that option is not available, I would fold and not attempt to try learning at all Yes!! Swimming, rollers skating, ice skating, even the freaking monkey bars for me (there is a lot more but I am blanking right now). I was always terrified of making a fool of myself and usually ended up doing just that when I actually attempted to do these things. Mhm! For me it is skating,swimming, and bike riding! I used to be able to ride a bike, but in these past years now that I have very bad anxiety, I cannot ride a bike anymore and it seems to just of had disappeared from my brain. It is so hard to embrace that getting comfortable making mistakes is a huge hurdle. In school or Work, I always shook and messed up being watched, did great by myself. When doing a group project, either let me do everything or I not do or contribute anything at all. Its like my brain stop working when I was in a group. it is hard to take languages because you have to be able to talk aloud in the language you are learning so your teacher knows you can speak the language, and i am good at the language i would just rather not speak in front of them aloud so it is hard. It is interesting that a source I read actually claimed that majority of people with SM are bilinguals. I also clearly remember being unable to speak when I had to speak in English (my second language). I cannot help but notice these seeming coincidences and wonder how they can be associated with possible cure for SM I agree. When I was evaluated for work, my boss gradually learned I would prefer that he did\u2019t inform me I was being evaluated because I did better. I also shifted courses in college because I could not stand working with a group. I preferred doing projects and writing papers on my own Agree. I started noticing how SM could be a symptom for fear of embarrassment. I can feel that I am way more relaxed in situations when I am surrounded with people who I know would not judge me I feel you. I wish I knew how to get rid of all these anxieties. Meditation though has helped a bit. But it can be frustrating with SM I mean, there already is a \u201ccure\u201d for SM. Exposure therapy and since SM is an anxiety disorder, anxiety management. Has exposure therapy worked for you or CBT (without the meds)? I know I am not the person you were asking but as someone who is currently going through exposure therapy and has been for about a year, it is been going wonderfully. It is important to note that I have a wonderful therapist who majored in social anxiety disorders. It is helped me get through school and work a lot easier. I will say that it is really hard at first and you need to put in a lot of work in your own side. But it is all worth it in the end, trust me! Hope I answered your question and that you have a good day! Thank you :) Sometimes, when one visits a psychiatrist\u2019s office, the dr prescribes medications right away. I think a more natural approach appeals to me. If I may ask, how does exposure therapy go for you? What are the exercises that you think really help you deal with SM?  It has been a very challenging journey for me and I am willing to try anything that would help. Thanks very much My therapist will often give me what are called \u2018brave practices\u2019 so basically I will rank on a scale from 1-5 (1 being easy, 5 being near impossible) how hard things are for me with my anxiety. It can be things like talking to someone I have never met, or answering a question in class, talking to my coworkers. we tend to start from easiest to hardest. Or whatever I am feeling that day. It is anxiety provoking but when I do it, it tends to not scare me as much once I have done it. I actually have started talking to people I do not know that well now, I was at a restaurant and I liked the waitresses shirt, and I complimented it. I have never done that before! That is wonderful to hear. So the brave practices are the main bulk of the therapy, I suppose? How frequent do you do it, is it like a once a day practice and does the dr. choose the activity that you would try?", "SM H.E.L.P.

I may have ADHD and part of this was written intoxicated, so... sorry.\n\nI joined the national guard when I was 17. I thought it would help force me to be talkative (not yet aware its SM). Instead I learned that it is moreso expression of personality that is hardest for me, rather than talking in general. The military rejects individuality in its functional/formal design, so I made it 6 years. It was not the prettiest 6 years, I did not make a single friend despite them all trying to force it to happen, and me not trying to resist. I could recite the soldiers creed &amp; communicate in few words that are strictly business, no interpersonal communication. I had a lot of anxiety, the worst moment was graduation from basically training. My family &amp; girl-interest was there, and we had to one-by-one stand center stage and scream our name and city as loud as possible. Immediately after, you go and shake the hands of high ranking genesis and officers, one of them gave me a funny look and asked if I am doing alright. I must have had had so much anxiety that I seemed like I was on something. But I did it.\n\nA weird thing is they brought a panda head in the barracks one time, and I popped it on. Suddenly I could roam around and kind of joke physically. I was not 100% free of Anxiety's inhibitions so the farthest I could take it is walking outside of the barracks to a humvee. I did not like it, being unable to do anything but walk with it, it just felt like a weird form of attention seeking, which I do not want lol. It brings anxiety. But something about that panda head seemed positive like it was an improvement. Others thought so too. I remember a guy saying \"look at you! We should a got you that panda head years ago!\". I think he caught me smiling, that is when he said that.\n\n\nNowadays, I am a mime. I have not practiced any performances yet, not sure I even want to. But, I got into face paint, and always sorta joked that I should just be a mime. So I finally dressed up as one with a beret and white striped shirt from hot topic. I like goth stuff and horror, so I already had black pants \ud83d\ude0e I loved how creepy it looks, and, it finally dawned on me that this is my spirit animal, or gender. I did a gender reveal snap story post \ud83e\udd23 snapchat stories are like a little window that I use for others to peer into my unrestricted personality a little. I recently started inviting strangers to my snapchat to see if it helps or hurts my case with trying to make friends \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe mime though. It actually seems to relieve more anxiety than it brings when I wear it in social settings, or at least switch up the kind of anxiety experienced. One of my biggest fears/anxious-worries when unable to fully talk, is a fear of coming across as rude or failing to be friendly. I used to HATE part of a job I had that involved walking through a nursing home because I love old people so much \ud83e\udd7a And all I can do is come off as cold and uninterested, which can be bad at times. Some of them always try to talk too. But, fears like this in public, are not a worry when you are a mime. On sight, people know you are not saying a word. i mean I do, I am usually with friends. I am usually intoxicated when I am a mime too, so keep that in mind.\nAll the times you meet new people and they wonder why youre so quiet or why youre not talking, the mime paint explains it, or at least gives them am explanation. It probably adds a bit of a puzzling element to what they see too, it is not something you see every day. At the same time theres negative attention in some situations like I dressed in a neon track suit for a riff raff show with 4 others, also in my mime facepaint. Some members of the crowd seemed a bit rude (sensitive people would be offended), others were supportive. I made the mistake of getting too intoxicated before the show and realized I was in the middle of murderappolis drawing a lot of attention to myself, too intoxicated to tell what is going on, unarmed, and not able to defend against any negative attention that came my way. I didnt like it. But I got a great pic with riff raff. I felt the best pose I could do under anxiety's suppression was the absence of any pose, just natural emotionless stare. The lighting hit my face just perfect, I look creepy and I love it. It goes with the facepaint as a horror theme \ud83d\ude01 Fuckin nailed it *self hi five* I had anxiety over that photo for over a month.\n\nI like the mime paint because it makes visible, what is invisible, a set of rules we are bound by. It is hard to break character.\nWe are mimes, trapped in our invisible boxes, invisible sanitariums (\"leave me be\").\nNobody sees the invisible box.\nWe are restrained within the box, invisible straight jackets, invisible gags, our personalities locked up tight.\nThe box appears when around others, few if any have ever joined us within the box.\nOur personalities are free when alone.\n\n\nThe selective part for me has been family in the past but switched to girlfriends. Thanks to online dating, and some people having patience with others thinking theyre just shy, I have had about 8 years of bad relationships (im told ive had bad luck) and a codependant (by design) situation. Life has steadily gone downhill over the years, and I am at a point where I aim to not jump into another bad relationship, stop overworking, and focus on myself. Learning to enjoy life and have fun, self care, and trying to make friends. Girlfriends kind of make you happy and forget you even got shit wrong with you, and its nice having someone you can talk to and be yourself with. But friends seem like a way better investment of time and efforts. Compared to always starting back at zero after each relationship.\n\nI feel like I have lost the ability to hold conversations online, if I ever had that ability. All I seem to be able to do is write massive paragraphs nobody wants to read. Plus women nowdays got to be so cautious with guys its hard to really figure out how to connect.

It doesnt follow social norms, but I dont really care \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Nor do I want to talk to people who go by social norms.

As does alone time, I can be me and self discover who I am and all that  alone. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I also hope to make bigger dents in the walls of the invisible box with friends. They are fine with me being a fly on the wall at social stuff with them. I know them through a friend I retained from kindergarden.\n\nThere is beach fires, where I took note that people play campfire songs. I kind of play guitar, and if I can practice songs enough to perform, that is a way I could participate without speaking. I get anxiety over playing, I can rarely play in front of others, but, it seems like I can play when I have practiced and know for sure I have the song down. That is performance anxiety, not inhibitions/restrictions. Oddly enough, I feel as if this is true for singing too, except that would be a lot harder \ud83d\ude05\n\nThere is concerts. I want to learn to dance, I never have. Some concerts you would dance in the crowd a little at though. I watched one of my friends dance and it was really cool like she just looked as if she was in her own happy world. (Dancing Queen). Sometimes all I can do is stand there cross armed not even able to smile. Other times I was jumping with the crowd and feeling the beat ^_^ not fully but its progress. I experiment with intoxication at shows though so idk if I have any logically concluded findings to share. The best experience I would say was Northern Invasion when I saw Tool. There were maybe 4 or 5 people in front of me, that is how close I was. At any poi t in time you had at least 5 people in contact with you, as well as crowdsurfers tumbling above. The crowd moved like a wave, you could almost pick ypur feet up off the ground and still be carried 10 feet in this direction with the crowd as one giant solid mass, then back this way, like an ocean of bodies, sweat in the air, tool playin nearby, it was great.\n\nThen there is bars. Pool is a solid thing, darts is more anxiety producing. Ordering drinks is difficult and anxiety producing. I do not order so feel like its a whole different language without a menu to even help you out. Peach crown royal &amp; dr pepper is a solid default order i know im ok with and just recently memorized. My panic/say-something-now order is jack &amp; coke, fireball, or jaegermeister because I know I can drink those. For beers i know im ok with busch light, angry orchard ciders, golden light, all the beers my friend shakes his head at, I can tolerate.\nIt can be kind of depressing going in bars and just seeing everyone else talking and having fun, and being unable to participate in any of that. Especially when your friends (who do not accompany you in the invisible box, or really understand it) are all talking too and they invite you to talk with them. It just brings to your attention the invitation/tease, and the reminder that you cannot, and can trigger downward spirals about how much of a curse it is being stuck in the box. BUT, it can be okay too. I go out mainly to try and be as social as possible, and seek improvement in my life wherever I possibly can.\n\nI have only been to a stripclub once so far. It was not planned, and was more anxiety than I thought. My back was kind of turned to the stage, I felt put of place (as I used to at bars initially), worse, my friends were all urging me to start throwing dollars at the strippers or get a lap dance, and being loud about it. One of them finally had the thought to approach it right and bought me a lap dance, which was really awkward like im going to creep this stripper out not talking, what do i do with myself or my hands or face, oh my god. It was a no touch dance so she instructed where to sit and put my hands, and from there you do nothing. its kind of embarassingly awkward when theres boobs in your face and youre just awkwardly nonreactive xD but it was pretty cool. Also, intimacy seems to unlock inhibitions with girlfriends, or play a part in it. There was a massive relief of anxiety after the lap dance. I could look at the strippers and people around there (in the eye if appropriate), and it was a nice vibe. beautiful women everywhere, everyones happy, even the strippers. cool music, cool lighting, and theres a bar in there, I had no idea how nice itd be in there. If I was not worried about money, I would probably be going there solo to work on fighting anxiety there while enjoying it. I imagine getting used to interacting with them might help with interacting with dates \ud83d\ude06  Be warned, they approach you and try to talk a bit before inviting you to a lap dance. I did not know this and was surprised one of them tried to talk to me, mentally I am like \"woman, I do not know you, what do you want?\" \ud83e\udd23 My friends later helped her talk with me which sucked because they do not know the best way to approach me either, so they are asking me my preferences on strippers and telling me I am making her feel bad \ud83e\udd72 instantly full of anxiety but managing to mask it and accidentally described her when I just want her to leave me alone because its already awkward \ud83d\ude02\nAnyways, it was an anxiety filled but cool night. And I want to go back more, not urgently, but when I got the money to waste \ud83d\ude0e You can go solo. There are articles online giving advice on getting over anxiety and going solo. I have not tried it but do not think mime face paint is a good idea at the strip club \ud83d\ude06 And not the best idea at bars unless ready to put up with negative attitudes towards it and have a good time anyways.\n\n\nAnyways, there is one of my long ramblings.\nAnyone else identify with the mime? \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude36\nAny other experiences outside the comfort zone?\nDoes the mime metaphorically match your mutism?\n\nNot sure what the forum rules are but I tried to keep it pg and popped a nsfw tag for good measure. What helps me is going somewhere alone and just asking a simple question to a shop worker or something, to me this really helps and it just feels normal! I talk if I go out in shop with my family but if someone approaches me I go quiet, so yeah I find it a bit pressured when someone comes with me. That is what helps me Exposure, start small, work your way up. What everyone is sensitive to is different. Mine was always triggered by emotions I had been taught were \"bad\" and \"not to be shared with others\". So over the course of my current relationship, I worked my way up from texting/paper to being able to speak about whatever I am feeling. \n\nIf your trigger is being around people you do not know or are not yet comfortable with, do like /u/plomicated said and start with people who do not matter to your daily life, with some small request that is easily forgotten as they go on with their day. Work up from there. Find what makes you uncomfortable, and push your limits a little at a time.\n\nSome days are better than others. Sometimes you will see almost a complete relapse, even years after you thought you were better. That is okay. Healing is a process, and there are steps backward as part of that. Be patient, kind, and understanding with yourself.", "Is this selective mutism? So I am 18 right now. The thing is that I used to be a talkative kid when I was 3-7, after that I became completely shut off to any other people than my family due to some childhood trauma. My circle of people that I am comfortable with is very small, and I am unable to make new friends because I become very withdrawn and anxious in social situations. Talking to doctors and teachers is a nightmare. My mind is not even blank when they ask me a question and I actually might know what I should exactly say, but the words just cannot come out of my mouth. Teachers are actually becoming really fed up with me because sometimes I cannot even give them one/two word answers and all I am capable of doing is shrugging my shoulders. If I am in a classroom full of other people, speaking is basically impossible because it puts even more pressure and anxiety on me. Preparing myself mentally for those situations does not help, I am never able to express myself anyway. I have no friends in my own class and sometimes I need help with my work and I am unable to complete it because I just cannot bring myself to ask anyone to help me, so I just rather sit there and I do nothing, and so I get no work done. Teachers are certainly mad. And just basically any social interaction makes me go mute even though I have things on my mind.  \n\n\nThe thing is...\n\nI am so social with people I know. I have no problem talking to them almost about anything. I have few friends in school, and they like me because we can just discuss all kinds of topics.. generally anyone who knows me better seems to like me and they think I am talkative.\n\nSo I do not really get what is wrong with me. I have never been diagnosed with anything (never went to get diagnosed), I believed for a long time that I might be on the autism spectrum, but I feel like if I were there I would have problems communicating in any occasion with anyone. But correct me if I am wrong! I am also really observant and I do not lack empathy.\n\nSo.. thoughts? I am really not sure what to think. To me it definitely sound like it could be selective mutism, although generally that is not caused by trauma. Everything else sounds really similar to my experience with selective mutism though, including wondering about autism but it not quite fitting before learning about selective mutism. Nothing is wrong with you. If you feel like you have selective mutism, you probably do. \n\nMost people are not nice. You only talk to people you feel like talking to..\n\nI think for me selective mutism was more about having my sister speak up for me. She was able to communicate things for me when I could not. \n\nI was terrified of everyone as a child. I felt like I was a mistake and not supposed to be on the planet. I felt like a trespasser everywhere I went. \n\nSelective mutism is a defense mechanism from extreme fear. It is no joke. If you have this, I pray you find a good psychologist to help you.\n\nI grew out of it as I got older, but it was very painful. Selective mutism is pretty rare. At 34 I was diagnosed with complex PTSD. I need so much validation. It is very hard for me to ask for help. I work on this every day. It is extremely painful for me to talk and I have agoraphobia. On the other hand, I am a bit of a bad ass loner and have some amazing friends who I can bullshit with for hours. You will find your way, but please do not beat yourself up Sounds like SM to me, I am no expert though.\n\nBut asking a professional may be an Idea, definitely helped me in my recovery. If you want someone to talk about it, hit me up! :) This could be selective mutism, though I would like to note not all autistic people struggle much with communication, especially not around close friends. Generally female autistics are better than male autistics at socialising. I think it is worth seeing a professional who can give you a definitive answer", "I had Sm when I was younger. So, when I was around 4 I had sm and I was never properly diagnosed or received any help, as I do not think it was well known about back then. I think my Nan passing away may of triggered it but I am not entirely sure. I would not speak to the teachers or anyone I did not know, I only really spoke to my immediate family and maybe my close friends. I started talking at some point but i struggled with speaking in certain situations and still to this day I experience anxiety with speaking. Just wanted to know if people anyone experiences this too? I just found this sub and am scrolling through the posts but I experienced the same thing as well. I was really young when I went through it so it is hard to remember. \n\n\nI have a few memories of when I started to break it and talk to people for the first time. I was getting sick of them always focusing on me because I was not talking! So I built up the courage to talk and then they would overreact, which would shut me right up again. \n\n\nAnyway I think my mom took me to therapy but I do not think it helped much. Even though I stopped being mute pretty young, I suffered with severe social anxiety for a long time.\n\n\nI am 26 now and definitely still struggle with social anxiety but it is so much better now. Still not great of course, but I cannot believe how far I have come. I had selective mutism since I was 3. It could be because we moved a lot due to my dad\u2019s job; we moved back and forth from 3 different countries before I would hit the age of 5. The pressure to keep up with different languages, cultures and environments may have contributed.\n\nTherapy worked for me. I whispered my first word to my best friend at school when I was in 2nd grade, and I kept improving from that point on.\n\nNow as a high schooler, I can say I have overcome selective mutism. But lately I was diagnosed with (surprise, surprise) moderate social anxiety, common in people who had selective mutism as a child. This may be similar to your case. I had selective mutism when I was young (about 4-9 years old). I consistently could not speak at school, to specific people, and even at some places (camp, for example). I do not think I ever got appropriately diagnosed either because it was not known. However, I remember seeing a School Social Worker which did not help me at all. I also remember my mom bringing me to the doctors, but I do not know if I got diagnosed ever. Anyways, now as a young adult, I definitely struggle with social anxiety still but it is getting better. My SA was really bad in high school though. I always find giving presentations still difficult and speaking in group discussions, but it is getting better with practice. Yeah it was so long ago it is hard to remember the exact  details, I remember vague details. \n\nWish it was more known about maybe we would have received a different outcome, but who knows. \n\nYeah I am better but it is horrible feel like it holds me back from reaching my full potential. \n\nAll the best anyway hopefully it gets easier for us all;) They say something normally triggers it off, so it could have been that, that started it. \n\nI kind of wish I had some help around the time I feel like I would not be as bad as I am now or it would of helped me around the time but unfortunately I did not get anything. \n\nI feel like I have overcome it mostly but there is so many things that still hold me back, which I think if I did not have sm back then I would not be experiencing this now. \n\nYeah more than likely it was hope everything\u2019s on the right track for you now:) Yeah I was the Same it would be more adults I would not speak around, only really my friends I would whisper too and I would speak to my immediate family. \n\nIt would probs make it easier if we received a diagnosis and had proper help to deal with it but it was not very well known about so...\n\nIt is not nice to still have to deal with SA cause it holds you back so much, I am hoping to go and get some help for it maybe because it gets to me so much and I hate having to try and hide that I am anxious. \n\nHope all is well any way ;)", "Thoughts on learning asl to communicate ? Im considering learning asl to make people believe I cannot actually speak, I can I just hate it. Every single time I have tried to talk in public I get so frustrated I want to cry and im tired of it at this point. I just wonder if it would be insensitive or disrespectful to fake that I cannot use my voice when there are people who are deaf or physically cannot speak. I do not want to offend people who actually need asl to communicate, I do not want to take advantage of them in any way. I want to go my whole life just using asl is that okay? Im tired of people at school nagging me about the fact that not a single word comes out of my mouth. I want to just have an excuse to use, a reason to explain my inability to speak so they will not bother me anymore. If you cannot speak or it is too hard to speak, using sign language is totally ok. Sounds like it might be a lot less frustrating for you, and possibly those who interact with you. I taught both of my speaking/hearing kids a bit of sign language when they were babies, and it was incredibly helpful. It is so cool how you taught them at a young age! I am definitely going to learn asl now thank you Babies learn asl easily. I taught my son a modified symbol for milk, meaning nursing, as well as things like more, ball, book, etc. I hope this helps you communicate with others, because that is really the point. If you cannot communicate one way, try something else. Good luck to you!", "Why do I have selective mutism? Like I know that its not always caused by trauma or anything but like...why am I like this? I was raised pretty normally and understand basic social skills I just cannot talk. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder. Just like any anxiety disorder, there is no particular cause. You were just born that way. Although there are some contributing factors that may worsen your SM. \n\nAs far as the science behind SM, studies of people with SM show that they have a decreased threshold of excitability in their amygdala, which is your brain\u2019s fear center. When presented with a fearful/dangerous scenario, your amygdala responds with a series of reactions that are meant to protect you. In people with SM, those fearful scenarios are everyday social settings, (school, work, parties, everyday errands, family get togethers, etc) and those reactions are being unable to speak, communicate nonverbally, and even being unable to move. Wow, this is so interesting. I had my aura picture taken once, and the woman who read my aura said that everything about me (both my facial expression and aura) showed an extreme amount of fear.", "Why some children are silent - Selective Mutism ", "Medication The doctor has offered my 8 year old medication to help with her anxiety. She also has diagnosed SM. \n\nFor those of you who are on medication, has it helped you with your SM ?\n\nThe medication offered was Zoloft. \n\nWhat do you think about taking medication, especially at 8 years of age.", "Kawhi Leonard has selective mutism? Im interested in sports amd there is only one athlete/celebrity that I thought was like me and that was Kawhi Leonard. Seems like the he has sm to me and found him very relatable to me even he rarely talks. What do you guys think does he have it? Doubtful. There is a lot of interviews of him and he is having full conversations. He could have social anxiety though.", "Which annoys people less - text to speech or writing on a pad of paper? I am really wanting to make friends one day, so I am trying to plan ahead of time on how to approach branching out a little more if covid ever becomes less of a threat. I was wondering which of the communication methods available to me would be least annoying to others - either writing things out or using text to speech. \n\n(For context, I am diagnosed with SM but I have not been able to make any sound in any situation in ages, even while home alone)\n\nI used to get by with writing things down on paper, but since then I have been mostly using a combination of ASL and text to speech at home ever since I got a bluetooth keyboard, and I can type faster than I can write. I cannot use this in public because I feel it draws too much attention to me, but I think I could maybe get used to using it one-on-one with someone? But I also learned that a *lot* of people find text to speech voices to be really annoying and grating, but I think people also get annoyed and impatient waiting for me to finish writing something out... (I mean ideally people would be patient or understanding, but that is not the case and I am lonely so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nI would just type things into my phone and show it to people, but the text is really tiny and my phone screen is really cracked which makes it hard to read \ud83d\ude16", "My brain scares me more than death.

But people do not accept that I cant even shake my head to answer and just force me to answer. The answer that I end up giving is just whatever I think will not piss them off, but most of the time both answers are wrong.\n\nIf I was just so mute that I could not answer anything at all.\n Maybe people would realize I am having a severe problem.\n Maybe they would be more gentle with me.\n Maybe I would not have to defend myself while mid panic attack day after day.\n Maybe I would not shutdown for 2-3 days a week in paralyzing fear from making a mistake.\n Maybe I could just be me, trapped, alone, inside my head, like I already am, but without any stress of communication. \n\nMy brain is the white padded walls im trapped inside.

As a child, I was overwhelmed by anxiety and unable to speak outside of my home. I remember descriptively as a child I felt frozen. So frozen I was unable to speak and get out any words due to feeling anxious. What became my escape was dance. I began dancing at age seven. Now I am a dance teacher and an award- winning choreographer, I truly credit the magic of dance for giving me the confidence to push through my anxiety. I am still very socially anxious in certain situations especially those that bring back past feelings of inadequacy. I still find it difficult to communicate in gatherings or with larger groups of peers.\n\nWhat started as a project over 10 years ago is now a published children's book \" Willow's Words \", A silent girl finds her voice.\n\nI wanted to share this all with you in hopes it can give you some relief and comfort as well as help you and your children. More research is needed to help those who suffer from crippling anxiety.

Is your book geared towards children or adults?", "school Started school", "Do you know anything about a selective mutism camp in Philadelphia? My dad is trying to force me to go to this camp during the summer. First of all we do not live anywhere close to there. I do not want to go but he is kind of blaming it on me and saying I have to go. I actually went to that in February. It is not exactly a \u201ccamp\u201d, it is more like a school environment. When my parents told me I was going, I was really anxious about it. I did not not want to go, *at all*. But it was a lot better than I thought, and I found it really helpful. I am even going again in June. \n\n( I do not know much about the place in Philadelphia (although my wife did read good things about it while she was researching places), but I did go with my wife and kid to a similar place, for a similar treatment and parent training. My kid\u2019s a good bit younger than you though, so I am sure there is some significant differences just due to that alone. My kid was also excited about the prospect of going, although incredibly nervous about it too.\n\nBut even with those differences, I would still highly recommend you go based on our experience. The staff at the place we went was to incredible, and they understood SM better than anyone we would ever met before. I am sure the staff at the place in Philadelphia is similarly good at what they do. \n\nIt will probably end up being a much more comfortable experience than you are expecting, and you will also learn how to deal with some of the comfort that will inevitably still exist.\n\nYour dad will also learn more about what SM is, and what it is not. That should, at the very least, help him understand your situation more, which cannot be a bad thing. You will probably learn some things about yourself as well.\n\nGood luck!", "Can selective mutism come back or am I just feeling anxious and overthinking this? A bit of backstory I had an array of speach issues like one would happen, I would go back to being fine my mum would be like yay she is good again then I would do something else like develop a tick and eventually she was like ok somethings up with my kid then I went mute. I was diagnosed with selective mutism when I was around 4 or 5 (I am not exactly sure I am going off what I remember my mum telling me) and was mute for a year or so, my parents got me into speech therapy and I was offered anti-anxiety medication but that sacred my dad so we just stuck to the speech therapy. So anyway, I got better and have absolutely no memory of ever being mute or experiencing selective mutism, I have a pretty rubbish memory and do not really remember anything from being little.\n\nThat is what brings me here because I have got into a relationship for the first time therefore completely uncharted social territory and I am worried I will clam up and not get a word out. As I have no memory of being mute I am not sure if I am just completely over thinking this or if going back into not being able to get words out is even a thing? \n\nMy worry is coming for the fact that I am basically fine in all social situation like answering a phone, going up to order food, introducing my self to new people etc because they are all well practiced and I cannot remember a time when that was hard for me so idk if I am just overthinking this now. And as a younger teen I would made friends with a very socially anxious group of friends so got even more practice at being the one to go up to ask for the order etc and got even more comfortable. But being in a relationship communication like flirting or expressing my feelings of attraction (like saying you are pretty) makes me fell anxious completely and as I have not really done this before I have got no reference on what to do or how the conversation might play out if that makes any sense. The last time I tried to get into a relationship with a friend when I noticed them flirting with me I remember just sort of smiling and nodding until they moved on idk why and I cannot remember what I felt in the moment just my reaction, once again my memory is not helping me.\n\nI have noticed recently I get words in muddles and say them the wrong way around and stumble over them and sometimes stutter out a word or two in a sentence oddly but I just go through it and I do not seem to get weird looks and I correct my self quickly so I am assuming I am just doing that a normal amount?\n\nContext of this relationship if it is important. I am 18 and have gone to uni, they are a friend from home and we have know each other for a while (please no one start telling me long distance is a bad idea I am not attracted to people that often and that is not what I am here to ask about). I would been muddling over my attraction to them for a bit but decided I was so close to uni and they were a good friend so there was no point in perusing it but then they asked me if I wanted to go on a date when I get back for the holidays. I decided screw the fact they are a long way away I do not get attracted to others that often, they are lovely, if I do not give relationships a try when they are offered I will just stay single. So we have been talking over text for a while now and we will use heart emojis, kisses and pet names and things and I am worried in person I will just clam up and not get a word out.\n\nI have told them I am worried about clamming up and not saying anything and they have been lovey and assured me it is ok if I cannot say anything and we can work out what to do about the together if it happens but the idea of them being affectionate and me just freezing makes me feel bad and then more anxious that that is in fact what will happen.\n\nSo I guess what I am asking is for those of you who still remember having selective mutism or have it now does it sound like I will clam up when I go home and speak to them in person or am I just feeling anxious in general and will probably be fine? Because if everyone says yah no it will not come back if you were treated as a kid and it worked your just overthinking, then I think that will make me less anxious but if not then I will just go with the flow. It seemed a good idea to ask incase it is all in my head and I am overthinking. Was mute till about 5th grade and It is hit me a handful of times as an adult.", "I have been thinking about going mute I know in most cases it is not a choice and I do not mean to disrespect anyone by posting this. \n\nTrigger warning \n\nHi I am Shawn I am transgender and thinking about going mute to pass better until I am able to go on hormones or possibly forever honestly. In middle school I almost went mute from trauma and bullying but was pulled from school before I had a chance to end my life etc. and became somewhat stable again. I have a job interview on Friday this week and I really want to test the waters and try it at the interview but then what if they do not higher me? It is considered disrespectful to go mute by choice ? I used to do it when I was younger and was upset. I do not have any speech disabilities, only mental ones. \n\nI am not really sure where I was going with this I was just trying to give a general outlook on me. I hope I am not being disrespectful in anyway and apologize if I am. \n\nI would really appreciate some opinions, thanks! hi - i was in your boat almost entirely. mute as a result of transness. not by choice, but more a subconscious association between my voice and being misgendered, and slowly the amount i talked lessened and lessened until i was mute in pretty much every social situation and quite literally psychologically unable to make my mouth talk. dude i am going to be straight with you - it is the furthest thing from fun. while i certainly did enjoy the aspect of passing it brought, trying to recover from the mutism has been brutal in some ways. it can be excruciatingly frustrating when i want to talk but cannot, and the way it is brought on this intense, intense anxiety whenever i want to talk. i have lost sleep over how much i regret not doing more to stop the mutism while it was in the earlier stages of development. i have been trying to overcome it for a year and i still cannot even speak to my best friend. if there is anything i can offer you in terms of advice based off my experience, is that i would heavily heavily advise for you not to do this. it is not enjoyable - i hate it.   I also think you shouldnt make the conscious decision to go mute, if you can talk, then you should, I guarantee any problems you may be facing will only be made worse if you were to go mute. It is also not exactly socially acceptable for someone to just be mute on purpose. You would most likely become accustomed to being mute, because it is somewhat of safety behaviour I think, so you would get comfortable, making it difficult to stop. I would also advise you not to do it. I hope me saying this little piece was not insulting in anyway and I hope you can effectively deal with your insecurities. I do not know, I have mixed feelings on the subject. While it is called selective mutism, for a lot of people because of their speech issues or anxiety it is not really a choice, or selected consciously. I do not think you should choose to go mute if you can talk. Do not choose to partake in a horrible thing for others. Maybe I am just biased because I want to talk to people very badly. Maybe reading literally every other post on this subreddit where people talk about their struggles with being mute should clue you in that it is not a good thing? \n\nEdit: Okay, I am going to try to be more charitable here and assume maybe you misunderstood what SM is. The \"selective\" aspect of selective mutism does not meant you can just select when you are mute or not. What it means is you are only mute with select people or categories of people. Like for me when I was SM I had no problem at all talking to my family at home, but when it came to talking to anyone outside of my family - particularly at school - I simply would not be able to. I would actually have physical trouble pronouncing words or controlling my breathing when I had to talk to other people. I had to limit what I said to only the shortest answers, usually just \"yes, no, I dunno\", because I would actually run out of breath and start stuttering if I tried to say anything more than that. The few friends I had in high school I would only talk to online or through written notes because I physically could not talk to them in person. That is what selective mutism is. It is a mental condition with actual physical effects on your body that can seriously fuck you up and, in my case, cause you to miss out on the most important developmental years of your childhood. It is not just a fun fad that some people do to avoid awkward social situations.", "What is this mouth movement? Hello all.\n\nMy 6yo daughter has selective mutism and is remarkably similar to the girl in this video. I have recently noticed when she is anxious or not sure about a situation she makes movement with her mouth but it remains closed. It kind of looks like she is chewing food or moving her tongue around in her mouth. I saw the 6yo girl in this video doing the same thing at around 13:22 - 13:28.....have not seen it anywhere else before.  ( Does anyone have any idea what it is or what it means? It is probably a coping mechanism she does when she is anxious/uncomfortable. She is likely chewing her tongue. I did the same thing, especially when I was being pressured I do something similar but what I do is I tend to bite my lips closed or bite the inside of my mouth when I am anxious", "College Roommate Hi all! \n\nI am not a part of this Reddit, nor do I have selective mutism, but I really need your help. \n\nI am getting assigned a new roommate (my first roommate dropped out) next semester, and she just told me that she struggles with selective mutism. I know I will not meet her for another month or so, but I would really like some advice on how to interact with her in the best way. \n\nI do not want to make her feel unwelcome or that she is broken or something,  or anything negative like that.  Nor do I want to make her feel like I am walking on glass around her. So, tips on what I can do or what I should avoid doing?\n\nIdk if this is helpful, but she said that she will write stuff down a lot, which is cool with me", "How did medication work for those who recovered/are recovering? Did you notice a difference once the medicine kicked in and/or was it really the sole difference between not communicating and communicating? Also, how long was it until you were communicating more normally?\n\nI would consider medication more heavily if I knew it was worth it, the drive for me is there to want to speak. It is just that next push that I need to start because I want to try and get over all of this as much as possible, really by the summer's end if possible. Or my next birthday. In the same way I want to change, the change also scares me, but I believe it would be for the best. I am 18 and 9 months.\n\nAnd when it comes down to me, I find communicating with those I know the most difficult, that includes my direct family. If I have zero attachment to someone I can speak normally, be it is sometimes low but I am out of practice in that regard really. It can also feel weird because I do not normally get in the situation where I do not know the person....but I can do it.\n\nJust fill me in as much as you possibly can. Thank you. Medication? What sorta of meds are you talking about. I have been on normal SSRI for a long time. I think that is what I mean, not too sure. I have been recovered for 20 years, but my psychiatrist and I started messing with meds last year. I found out I am autistic two years ago and that is what we are trying to help with meds, so YMMV. Up until I found that out, I thought the SM was independent.\n\nMeds have done wonders. First try was sertraline and it had a hint of a positive effect, but the negatives were too great. So we switched to bupropion and it was all good marks, so then we doubled it and it is been awesome.\n\nI was concerned meds would make me feel not like myself, or that I would be happy but it would be an artificial happy. But they are very subtle. I feel the exact same day to day, but when my mind starts spinning I can catch it now. That is really it, and it makes all the difference in the world. That is good to hear, are you able to communicate well now?\n\nEdit: I just realized that may sound like a stupid question, but I appreciate the response nonetheless. It can work. Not a stupid question! Yes I can communicate well now. I still have internal aftereffects, but to others I am a well-adjusted communicator and person, and for that outcome I am happy to deal with the internal stuff. Years ago, I tried an MAO inhibitor and that allowed me to chatter away with the NTs like nothing else. Not even alcohol worked as well.\n\nTotal Faustian bargain: I was constantly nodding off during the day (as if I were on a sedative) and I gained 30 pounds. Two months later the drug completely pooped out. I would not recommend it to anyone.\n\nI have been on several other classes of antidepressants and nothing really worked. My brain still goes blank in most social settings, unless I am talking with one person about a special interest. I do not think any meds has really made me talk more. At most I was on a strong anxiety med briefly that made me feel relaxed. Quietly relaxed more so. I did not think any meds could really help you talk more. The anxiety med made me too sleepy so I needed to get off of it. I am almost 18 and was prescribed sertraline a few months ago with help from psychologists and a psychiatrist. I am not able to talk to most people yet but I am definitely improving as I can talk infront of people that I could not have before. In the UK it is hard to be prescribed medication for sm due to the links with suicide and you will still need CBT at the same time but for me, it was worth it. Good luck! I have been on Lexapro and Fluoxetine in the past. When I first started taking them, it made it so I was able to start talking to my close friends and people I felt comfortable around.\n\nHowever, both of these medications made me act out in bad ways. I would say whatever came to my mind even if it was super rude to say. They made me have violent thoughts about hurting other people; craving to enact violence on others. I do not know why they made me feel that way.\n\nSo yes, they did help me, but you might want to be aware of how they can change you in negative ways as well.", "help me please I am an 11 years old boy (I know my age is not enough to be in this website yet), but I really need help, I have selective mutism I had it this year, last year I was very talkative but when this year came, I could not talk to people or my classmates anymore, home was my comfy spot, I could talk as excessive as I wanted, though everytime in school I am always forced to talk, sometimes my classmates hurt me because they just want me to talk, I get annoying replies most of the time too, and recently today when I was on the bathroom someone sprayed water on my head through the upper door part, when I came back to class all I could say was, I accidentally washed it, sorry to my teacher, I found out that the bully was the one who forced me to talk always, he also pinched me for a minute really bad causing me to bleed, he repeatedly said \"Talk, why will not you cry, are you crying on the inside then?\" I was really pissed off and hoping I could punch him but I could not, it felt like my anxiety was pulling me off, sometimes I cry on my bedroom or even cut myself because I cannot talk, my parents do not believe me they think im exaggerating, and afterwards the day I would blame myself or even be suicidal. Hi there. You are not alone in your struggles! There is help out there for you. You are a person on this earth and all of us go through tough times. There are caring people who can assist you with getting the support you need. Call 1-800-273-8255. \n\nI am sorry your parents may not fully understand what you are going through. Keep trying to get through to them. Use your counselors at school too. \n\nAn internet friend.  Your anxiety is not your fault. Do not ever forget that. You deserve to get help ASAP. If your parents will not get you to a professional, you can at least seek adults you can trust in your school, and communicate your needs with them. Write it out if speaking causes too much anxiety. I have messaged you some materials that could be of help. Best wishes. I am so sorry you are going through this.  I had selective mutism from about 6 years of age to about 17.  What helped me was getting counseling.  Can you ask the counselor at school for help?  I know it is hard, because you probably feel like you cannot talk to a counselor.\nPlease open up to your parents about this.  It is a form of anxiety, and it can be treated!\n\nYou can get better, but you must somehow ask for help.  Maybe you could write your mom a letter, describing what you are going through?  Or write a letter for the counselor at your school?\n\nLet us know how you are doing. I am so sorry to hear your bully is treating you in such a way. Children can be cruel and ignorant. In my opinion selective mutism is just deep seated anxiety. The understanding that I have come to through my research is that people with this condition have some deep seated anxiety, an overactive amygdala, and self-doubt. Do not get me wrong I am not writing you off as \"too sensitive\". You have a real condition. You are condition can also be mislabeled as autism, aspergers, or being afraid to talk due to a speach impediment. Some may even see you as being rude and uninterested in their social advances. They do not see that you more likely than not have trauma and prefer to keep to yourself and only open up to those you truly trust. I used to have social anxiety when I was younger and still do at times; trust me it gets better. I used to keep to myself unless it came to those who were close to me or when I was with strangers in a small group with people close to me by my side. Girlfriends of mine in my past who needed to be friends for quite some time saw a whole different person and world in me the closer we got. Trust me, as an adult you care less and less. There is so much pressure at your age and as a newly young adult (18-20). I am in my mid twenties now and have fully become myself and have no anxieties about people's opinion of me. I used to be shy and still can be at times (I am introverted so that is to be expected to a certain extent). Be yourself, give it time, and do not give up. Please do not self harm. Find other ways of relief. You are a valued person. ", "Maybe I should get help (idk) Maybe I should get help for my anxiety. It is too idk strong. I am fine (somewhat) most of the time but asking me if I am ok tears almost immediately lol. I hate it especially at my age (31). And it does not help when stress wants to play along, and boy did it have fun. One of my coworkers was complaining about having to do topstock even when there was plenty of room up top (this stressed me out ok). I want to be comfortable at my job. I want to be confident. I want to have friends, talk and joke around. Sometimes I feel like I do not belong, everyone would be happier if I left. I am doing the best that I can talking wise. The fact that I can tell one of my coworkers if they come into my aisle to help me, what needs to be worked and what is overstock, or asking someone what needs to be worked or just in general a question, or asking someone who works in the back a question, or one of the team leads a question, I think I am doing pretty good lol. It is not being able to strike up a conversation. Not being able to loudly say good morning back to someone. My anxiety always takes control and I do not think practicing could help. Idk what to do. I am just tired of it. idk how or where to get help anyway. That is where I am with people I do not associate with, I can do the minimum (If I am in the mindstate to want to)...but to do more, I cannot/do not have a care to....although I do, at the same time.\n\nI want change, but I also want to sit away in the same room alone all day, ignoring everyone which is what I do.................the summer and I wanted to always do things, *nothing* was boring to me. Now it is the only thing I want to be doing.....\n\nI want normal life but equally and more so, have resentment towards it. I would talk about more, but I do not care to continue.", "I was able to mouth a word! I know the title might be weird, but usually I freeze a bit and I cannot say or mouth anything to people who are not part of my family. \n\nToday I went to a shop on the way home from school to buy a packet of gum because I did not have any left. Went in, picked up the gum, got my money out, scanned it at the self-serve, and the note would not go in. It had been crumpled in my bag. Someone working there came over and helped me straighten the note out and get it working. When she was done and it worked, I was able to mouth \u2018thank you\u2019! I am really happy about this, even if I was really anxious at the time and will probably end up thinking about it tonight, but for now I am happy and proud :D Congrats \ud83d\udc4c Yo that is awesome!! Makes me glad to hear it.\n\nAnd there is no need to be anxious about it, she is forgotten about it already. Well done man! I hope this keeps up and you can keep.profressing Hearing things like this make me so happy! I remember what it was like to be there. Never being able to say thank you or your welcome or excuse me. I am shocked now when people without SM do not say it, because to me it feels like a privilege.\n\nCongratulations! It sounds like progress is being made. I am glad that situation turned out to be good! I am happy for you. yay :3 congrats i know how it feels and im very proud of you 2 hehe :) That is really huge! Once you get to that point it only gets easier. And do not worry about them thinking anything about it, mouthing \u201chi\u201d or \u201cthanks\u201d is pretty typical even for people who do not have SM.", "Do you welcome Selective Mutism? \n\nI am 19 and an architecture student at university. I have never been a selective mute, even though I tend to be very quiet. However, since starting the first year of my studies, I have struggled with making/keeping friends and become depressed. I am a 'dreamer' who holds extremely high expectations of certain situations and am easily disappointed by the reality, and as a result I have started to shut myself out from other people and avoiding social situations.\n\nEarlier this year, I lost my voice for a few days and had to resort to writing to communicate with people. Ironically, I felt far more free then than before. I have noticed that for the past few months, I have started to talk less and less when possible. It is not really SM, because it is voluntary and I can talk when I really need to, so maybe you would call me simply antisocial, but I always felt afraid of speaking to other people and wished I could just not say anything. And now I guess I am starting to act on that.\n\nSo I wanted to know if there are any *actual* SMs who do not mind not being able to speak, and instead welcome it as a necessary part of their lives. I realise that for most, it is extremely frustrating and debilitating. But SM is not a well-explored disorder, so I am curious to know if, for some, it is a peaceful respite rather than a disadvantage. I have never welcomed it, never enjoyed it, etc etc. In some instances when I would not bother even trying to speak as i knew i would fail, so in that sense it was kind of a safety behaviour to avoid the hellish emotions i would have from trying to talk. Although even then I would have given anything for the ability to participate in school, friendships, society and all that. As it is an anxirty disorder it is accompanied negative emotions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downsides to SM are not just anxiety or being unable to speak. But also the way people treat you. Like you are stupid. Like you are selfish or rude. Like you do not even exist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd sorry about being pedantic but it is a pet peeve of mine: Antisocial = Actively harming or being hostile towards society. Asocial = indifference towards society No, I do not welcome my SM. I hate having selective mutism. It has taken my life away from me. I cannot stop thinking about all the things I could be doing if I did not have SM. I am missing out on friendships and am very isolated because I cannot communicate, which has lead to me having depression. I cannot have a job, and I can hardly make it to school because of how anxious it makes me feel. At school, I am bullied and ridiculed because I cannot speak, and all I can do is just sit there. I am defenceless. I am constantly viewed as just rude and oppositional. That is far from the truth. I would do anything to not have SM. I would not say I welcomed it, but when I still had SM I saw it as a permanent part of my identity. Something that was completely tied to me, for better or worse. Felt more like a death sentence than a positive thing though. The attitude one has towards a cell is very different when one does not have the key. It is not that I \"welcome\" my SM, but it is that I have accepted as a part of me. I hate that I cannot socialize, make friends, talk to strangers in public. But I have come to realize that this is who I am, and who I have been my entire life, and it is just pointless to spent every day hating myself, wishing I could \"normal\". My son has SM and I have social anxiety.  Psychiatrist thinks SM is just a more severe form of social anxiety and meds help him.  For me I hate talking on the phone, I will do everything I can to avoid a phone conversation: text, email, etc. I use doctors and dentists that I can make online appointments for even if that means they are much further than other providers. I guess I am saying I can relate to SM somewhat. In regards to your question, it does seem nice to not have to talk to people for a period of time, but not all the time. I think that is an introvert trait. I cannot really speak for people with SM, but I do not think they view talking to the outside world as a switch they can turn on and off, it is like a switch they cannot turn on. Not really...Sometimes being quiet eases me in situations where other people would reply or ask questions. But mostly I feel frustrated. \n\n\nInterestingly, I think my SM is going away recently. I now can speak loud enough to the bus driver that he forgot to open the exit door in a bus with some people...well, most of the time. I now even argue something with the teacher in a class.\n\n\n A few days ago our class was casually discussing how people who take *any kind* of drugs that treat mental illness(include depression, anxiety and all the other trivial shit) was not allowed to work in a medical profession.\n\n\n I mean at my current region, *legally* people are allowed to get the license if their doctor says they are handling their psychological issues well enough to work in that field. \n\n\nBut once the information gets out, your life is ruined (the law here states licenses will be taken away if someone did not report what drugs they were taking *before* getting that license, so one may be scared and just get the paperwork done). \n\n\n\nThen, if they try to get into a hospital, which got the *mandatory notification*(once it is out, it is **OUT**.) saying they were taking antidepressants, the hospital would just pick other people. Even if I passed the license exam for whatever medical profession with decent grades, and depression/anxiety is well handled with anti-depressants/antianxiety meds, I would not be able to work if that info ever formally got out.\n\nI was always angry at this fact and because I am currently facing a similar issue, I raised my hand, asked the teacher some questions about the details, and things led to me talking about how having a well-handled mental illness should prevent people from reaching their potential, dream, whatever. It was like some debate class lmao. The class went quiet. The bell rang and everybody went home. I had to stay late to do some late paperworks, while seething and near tears. The teacher came over for a min. and asked why I was so upset about that issue, I replied and actually had a conversation, and she said 'now that you point it out, that really sucks'. Many people would agree but well, I cannot change the law.\n\n\n\nuhhh sorry OP, I have no idea how my comment ended like this lmao.. for me, absolutely not. i had SM up until i was 11 years old and if i had to describe how i felt, i would say it was like being trapped in a very small room without any way to get out.  i often wondered to myself, why was i born like this? why can everyone else talk freely except me? going to school everyday and my parents leaving me alone for just a bit made my life a nightmare, because they were the only ones i could speak to normally. i had to rely on them for everything, like ordering at restaurants, talking to other adults, etc. back then, i would have given up anything to be able to speak freely.\n\nit is been 7 years since my recovery from SM, but obviously i have crippling social anxiety. i am happy that i am able to talk normally to adults and strangers, but i get very nervous and have to build up courage to do it. oh, how i would give anything to be free of this anxiety, too... Yes, I suppose even just having the choice to speak makes all the difference. Can you communicate well with other people otherwise, or does that form of social anxiety extend to outside phones?\n\nAs for the introvert thing that you mentioned, I think I was viewing silence as an extremist short-term solution, that if continued for too long, would likely create troublesome long-term problems. Yes, in my situation I would be glad to have an excuse to prevent people from talking to me. But it is not something that can be sustained, just a band-aid on a wound that will eventually heal. Whereas sufferers of SM have no choice but to sustain it and adapt to it, even if they are not in that kind of situation.\n\nThanks for your answer, and I hope your son improves with time. Good analogy. Were you planning on working in a medical profession? Either way, I am very sorry that the law works like that. I now understand that it is unfair, and not at all useable as an excuse, because people with SM (as well as depression, bipolar, and other disorders) do not choose to have it. They never have the opportunity to _get to_ a situation where they want to be silent, because they have never had an opportunity to _not_ be silent. Catch 22, seems like.\n\nI cannot say I know exactly what it is like to find out the world is against you if you have a mental ilness, but I do know those feelings of helplessness and hindrance that arise from them. To have a vision for yourself and realise something is holding you back. But I think that in those cases, one has to sometimes make a drastic move, a leap of faith, to try to get closer to where they want to be. If the law where you are is against you like that, could you move to a different country to get your license? Nowadays, international study is more accessible than it has ever been. You are right, I am not thinking about this far enough. At the risk of almost sounding like some sort of sociopath, I never considered how others might perceive people with SM, because I myself would quite like the people around me to think I am selfish or rude, or just forget that I exist (hence the antisocial part; I would have otherwise used asocial). That is short-sighted.\n\nLike I said in a different comment on this thread, people with SM never get to a point where they _want_ to create distance from others because they have difficulty in closing distance as it is. I realise that now.\n\nInterestingly however, I have seen many  people posting on various message boards for autism, saying that they want to become silent and shut themselves out from others. In these cases, social anxiety is a motivator because in failing to build social connections and acceptance, it creates a frustration that is taken more personally.\n\nIt is no longer just a matter of being able to speak, but these people come to believe that their own personalities are what cause them trouble. So they look towards extreme solutions. I believe that is what I am feeling, and mistakingly aggregated this with the issues that Selective Mutes face.\n\nI am sorry if I was insensitive with my post, and I think I do understand the community here a little better thanks to everyone on this thread. I like your writing..the most quiet people are often also the most thoughtful and intelligent people from what l've seen so far (except me ha)\n\nMy situation's like 'do not *do not* ask, do not *do not* tell' if this makes sense lol... they will just take a pee or blood test, to screen for illegal drugs(which i do not use!) so if i do not formally file some paper, I think im not in a big mess...i hope.?\n\n\nI do want to work in a medical career. (My competing interest - research career - did not go so well ha)\n\n\nFor now, I am studying in a course for the 'Nurse-aide' license. (2 levels of nurses here - RN &amp; this) It is somewhat like an in-between of LPN and diploma nurse in terms of medical responsibility/education.\n\n\n\ni actually majored in nursing for my first 2 yrs in univ..(RN-BSN program) I changed majors due to many reasons, including this crippling social phobia. (I was not disliking becoming a nurse)\n\n\nI started seeing a psych doc for the first time just as I changed majors. After about 2 months of medication, at a certain point, I actually felt fine talking to a stranger in a clear voice, and the first thing that hit my mind is: godammit. i should have convinced my parents that I needed professional help much earlier. \n\n\nI really miss the model patient dolls and thigh models that beeped so loud when I did an MI (muscle injection) wrong lol\n\n\nI do want to study somewhere else.. (i spent some of my childhood abroad, so I am not as afraid of moving countries) I am currently looking for an accel. program in other countries.. my place does not have that(a 1-yr program for college graduates). \n\n\n\nIt is really complicated to convert my school record here, let alone my qualifications and fee. Well the one thing i do not have to worry too much is language.. I have been searching schools &amp; gathering my school records etc. since a year ago, took a language test, etc. Other than that I could not do much of anything cuz last year was, well, let us say I had a nervous breakdown that went on for months hah Same with me. Sometimes I wonder about what it is like to have a friend group, be part of a club, or literally be able to talk easily in public. I cannot work either because of it. I skipped school a lot in elementary because I did not want to go in that dumb building and see those kids anymore. And it hurts a lot having to force myself to speak, and when I really cannot, the teacher and other kids do not understand at all. My whole life I just sat there and watched the other kids have fun and have all the opportunities. My childhood was nothing and I do feel disappointed. I probably still have depression since a couple years ago. Sometimes, at least I wish I had a friend I can trust, and tell them about my SM and they would understand me. But I do not have that either. I am 3 months late to this,but I just found this sub,sooo here goes anyway. I have selective mutism and I do not mind it. I have never felt frustrated  by it, I do not mind being alone with just my dogs as company. After reading this sub though it seems i am the odd one out.", "How do you start a conversation? Tomorrow is my 3rd day of 12th grade. In 3 of my classes their are kids at my table who are by themselves, so I want to try to talk to them in order to make friends but I do not know where to start. I feel like if I managed to speak the conversation would be very short and there would be awkward tension for the rest of class. Also I am afraid that they might want to be left alone and not be friends. Does anyone know how to hold a longer conversation and what topics to talk about? Btw I cannot make conversation on the schoolwork because teachers are not really giving us any yet. Any tips are appreciated. I think watching youtube videos where people are out and having conversations is a good help imo. Sneako and Peer-to-Peer podcast are two channels I watch regularly, among many others. The Reason I watched them initially was for entertainment, but watching their videos can give you conversation tips Be an interviewer, or talk show host. Dont try to say anything \"impressive\". Most people like to talk about themselves so start with just asking questions about them. Sooner or later most people will ask a question about you.\nIf you know anything about them start with that. People love talking about topics they know and like (crazy right lol).\n\nKeep it to something like this format: question, question, statment. \n\nExample: so you are into *whatever*? Oh awesome, what got you into that? Yeah I think that too! But have you done this before? No?! Dang that would be cool though, I have always wanted to try that!\n\nTalk show hosts keep the attention on the interviewee and from time to time sprinkle in some stuff about themselves. If you listen and ask questions you will be better than most people.Try to have fun learning about them. \nFriendships develop over long times through shared experiences and interests. Put yourself in a position to talk to them multiple times and it is possible a friendship will form. Good luck! Idk, all my friends approached me, I could not initiate T3T", "relationships it feels like theres something wrong with me anyone can date but me it seems. every single guy unadds or blocks after talking a bit or immediately after meeting me bc im too awkward only guy who did not was my ex but part of the reason he broke up with me is bc he did not know if i wanted to have sex &amp; that someone with my anxiety should not be with someone bipolar &amp; i still was not completely comfortable around him after almost 3 months. that was 2019 &amp; i basically have not met anyone since him. i tried losing my virginity when i was 17 &amp; i was not comfortable enough &amp; had to stop after a few seconds so im glad that guy was not completely shitty especially considering the fact that yes/no are impossible for me in person but idk no matter how hard i try i cannot find anyone that does not just expect sex when idk if i can ever be comfortable enough after getting told that if im not willing just fuck then i should probably just stay single\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01  Hello, I am also almost 20 (b-day is next month) and I have never even been close to having sex. So you are not alone in your struggles.\n\nIdk if your using dating sites or meeting people IRL (I am assuming the latter) but you can put that you are not interested in hookups in your bio just to weed out the people who are.\n\nIf you have not already, you can try OkCupid. On there you can select what kind of relationship your interested in (Hookups, marriage, friendships, long or short term dating) and you can set how important it is too.\n\nBasically, on there it is easy to see right away people who are interested in relationships versus just sex. Once that is taken care of you can start looking for someone who works well with the way you are. Some people cannot handle dealing with people who have anxiety disorder but it is not hard finding people who can. I have dated 3 people in the past and the reason we broke up had nothing to do with my SM.\n\nGood luck, and if you ever want to talk about it, my DMs are open. Wow this sounds like good advice", "What is the point in finding the cause of it? The doctors spent a long time trying to find the cause for SM, but I think back and believe that it is absolutely useless because it did not treat me.\n\nWhen you are shot with an arrow, you can either look for the person who shot it or take it out and care for the wound. To me, sm was clearly a fear response the treatment for which should be standard. So why did the doctors waste so much time finding the cause for it? Was it just an excuse to not have to put effort in then give up later like \"we tried everything we could\"? Sometimes people display symptoms of SM after they undergo trauma, and the treatment for underlying trauma would be different than something that is rooted in (social) anxiety. Does not mean everyone with SM has experienced trauma, it is just a possibility that they might want to explore a bit. It is more like they are looking for the arrow, not the person who shot it. They need to find the arrow in order to be able to pull it out. As an example, if someone had PTSD from being bullied, the emotions s/he felt while being bullied would be the arrows.", "Soft spoken as adult My body and vocal cords just do not sound like how I imagine and want myself to speak.\n\nPutting too much emotion into my voice feels so fake.\n\nI cannot speak loudly and with a mask it is even worse, since people cannot hear me.

I have not taken my own advice, but I have heard of Speeko app which is an AI speaking coach. Also r/talkbetter is interesting and might have advice. I thought I was the only one that thought a mask makes it worse lol I noticed, because people ask me to repeat more often what I was saying... Yes this happens a lot to me too even when I do not wear my mask", "A poem by Carl Sutton &gt; Some days my rusted tongue is freed, set free \n\n&gt; upon a breath of light and chink of air \u2013\n\n&gt; in whispers first, as whispers are the key \n\n&gt; to later, raging, roaring like a bear. \n\n&gt; Some days the rusted door is left ajar, \n\n&gt; and out the shadows of my whispers waft \u2013 \n\n&gt; my face is near but voice is from afar \n\n&gt; at first, but then I sing and hoot aloft. \n\n&gt; Some days I hoot of silence to the sun; \n\n&gt; I hoot, uncaged, of freedom of the tongue \n\n&gt; but yet, by dusk, unfree, I am undone: \n\n&gt; my mouth rusts shut each evening and I am wrong. \n\n&gt; Some days my rusted tongue is freed, I rage \n\n&gt; until the iron nighttime of my cage.\n\n&gt; -Carl Sutton\n\n", "I need some guidance. Please \ud83d\ude4f  That is an extraordinarily effective description of your experiences.  I felt I was there with you in the interview.\n\nI will let others say their perspective about the relationship of your experiences to SM, as a separate condition, the reason I am commenting is mainly to ask a question:  Is it speaking that is gone?  I.e., are you able to write things down when you are unable to express verbally?  \n\nI know I have varying abilities to express myself, that differ by topic and setting, such as you describe with your family communications.  And that I am able to express myself \"on paper\" about things that I am unable to \"talk\" about, at all.  The reason I follow this sub is because I wonder if that is \"selective mutism\".  I have a broader diagnosis in which difficulties in communications are one aspect, so it is not clear how to label the situation, even though the experiences may overlap.  I read the sub in order to connect with stuff specific to this aspect of my experience.\n\nThank you for posting, I look forward to reading other responses, perhaps some with answers instead of questions.  As a start, since you are unable to afford therapy, perhaps you could find a resource for the autistic community in your area to volunteer with to gather information from whatever is going on there?   Treating the anxiety would be one way to go. Another way to go would be a speech therapist.  Sometimes the anxiety will always be with you but the strength of it will decrease as you get used to life as an adult. This is especially true since you are under the age of 25 so your brain has not fully matured yet. This can make a big difference. You sound like you are having unwanted thoughts and that they distress you for quite a while. You can look up \"unwanted thoughts\" or ( to see if there are suggestions on how to handle them.  If they significantly affect your life for more than three months it could be considered PTSD.", "Is the cause of sm different depending on the age of onsent For example is getting sm at 3 years old vs at 15 years old a way to tell the cause of it? Talking about the \"cause\" of sm is kind of difficult in general (we do not know forthe most part), so I would say no. (\n\nI think SM often gets used as a umbrella term for mutism here. However, there are lots of different reasons someone might develop a kind of mutism. \n\nThe DSM5 clinical definition of SM is quite precise and technically a 15 year old who suddenly became mute in certain circumstances would be unlikely to receive a diagnosis of SM and would be more likely to receive a different diagnosis, such as PTSD or social anxiety disorder. Onset of SM is usually before the age of 5. A 15 year old might have untreated SM that dates back to when they were very young though. \n\n(Also, keep in mind that the DSM5 is just one way of classifying disorders and it is not the be-all-end-all of mental health, just a tool for clinicians to use.)\n\nSo yes, there are different causes, but also childhood SM is considered a different condition than mutism acquired later in life. This is important as different treatments will be more or less useful. The treatment for someone with classic childhood SM would not necessarily be appropriate for someone with traumatic mutism and vice versa. \n\nThis sub likely sees a wide variety of people experiencing different forms of mutism as there are not many under 5s on Reddit! apparently i did not talk tell i was 5 years old Nice answer. I have seen diagnoses of SM that onset in middle school too. And mutism that was trauma-induced in adulthood. There is also the consideration of autism and ASD-related nonverbal episodes that are distinct from sm. &gt; apparently I did not talk until I was 5 years old \n\nThat is not typical of SM. SM usually presents as being freely able to speak at home around your parents, and unable to speak in *social* settings, such as school, work, etc. Sounds more like a different speech issue/delay, maybe due to autism or something else. I am sorry your parents ignored it, though. Unfortunately that is pretty common.  no what happen is my parents keep me locked up in the house at lest tell they moved.. at age 12   they did not do this to my brother or sister.. straight up child abuse   and yes i did have issues talking to people (anxiety issue), it is still an issue today...", "Situation rapidly deteriorating   \n\nHello everyone. This is actually the first post that I have made on the internet, although I have been reading for a while. I made an account just for this post, so I hope I am doing everything correctly. I am writing out of desperation for ways to overcome selective mutism, which I have had my entire life. I am currently a 23-year-old male living in the United States.\n\nI have known that I specifically have SM since I was thirteen. Before that, I thought I was just shy or anxious. I had very little contact with people in general because I was homeschooled throughout all grades. The only socialization that I received was from going to the grocery store with my mom, but I still never had verbal contact with people as shoppers do not typically talk to each other. I have recently finished college and obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree, but I still barely had contact with people. I was also a commuter student, so I went back home to live with my mom after each day of classes. I have never had a job and my family heavily discourages me from working.\n\nWhen I was young, I could not talk to strangers while my family was present, visible, or there would be any possibility in which my family would know what I said to the other person. If someone spoke to me when my family was watching from a distance, I would either ignore them or speak one-word answers to them out of the side of my mouth like a ventriloquist. Now, my SM has manifested and worsened to the point to where I cannot indicate feelings, desires, or show initiative in front of my family. To this day, my family has no idea that I have selective mutism and I am unable to tell them. I cannot get any treatment from a therapist because SM prevents me from showing that need.\n\nNow that I have finished college, I feel like my life is finished. Since I cannot work, live on my own, or do any activities outside of home, there is nothing left for me to do but wait until death. I literally wake up in the morning, look at memes for ten hours, and then go back to bed, all while eating copious amounts of candy. I get very sad when I think about all of the things that I have missed out on that other people are able to do so easily, as well as the things that I want to do that I will never achieve. I am at the point where I must either recover or commit suicide. As I see it, I have only two options that do not involve my death:\n\n1. Disappear in the night and move to another state. If I do this, I will certainly be homeless for a few years, but if I manage to hide myself from my family, I could have the life that I wanted, secretly. I would rather move to another country to have more distance, but I cannot hide that because it requires filling out paperwork beforehand.\n\n2. Kill my family. In my state, I will probably receive a sentence of at least ten years if it is an \u201cact of passion\u201d, but after my sentence, I will have my freedom. I feel very guilty when I think of how relieved I would be if my entire family was dead. I would have more freedom in federal prison than I do right now. Definitely do not want to do this! \n\nAs you can see, I am quite desperate. I would literally rather die than talk to my family about my problem. I much prefer option one. As long as I am thinking of suicide, I might as well take a stab at going AWOL before killing myself. Do you guys have any tips that might help me?  I mean, I think walking away and dealing with the consequences is far superior to killing your family.  But also, consider there may be other options available to you.  Sometimes when we have endured a problem for far longer than we should have, the only way we see out is the grand finale.  The big resolve.  But in reality, most problems can be resolved in smaller manageable steps.\n\nI do not understand why you would rather die than talk to your family, or a therapist, about this?  SM happens.  There is no blame or shame.  It is just how it is.  Maybe your family is wonky, as some of us are so blessed.  But then, please, talk to a therapist or other mental health professional.  Because they are likely to be more helpful than a random sampling of redditors who saw your post.  (And obviously by talk, I do not mean words coming from your mouth.  Type or write what you want to say, like you have done here.)\n\nAnd if that is really not ever going to happen, then my vote is to hit the road.  Read up on the nomadic life between your sweets, and see if that is actually a reality you would choose for yourself.  Walk to the next city over, and feel this life.  Changing up our routines can help us to remember how to appreciate our lives, no matter how that life is lived. i am slightly confused why your family does not know you have selective mutism, what do they think you have? If they are discouraging you from working, they definitely think you have a problem. They think I am just extremely shy. They do not know that I behave differently depending on if they are there or not. My family discourages me from working because no one in my family has a traditional job. They sell services online, and expect me to do something similar or help them. We are not wealthy at all, but we live very simply and cheaply. What if theoretically someone else was going to tell them what was going on with you? Would you do everything you could to stop them from finding out? I agree. I think that hitting the road would be a positive outcome for me in the long term, but it is easier to say that when I have a roof over my head. It is a huge lifestyle change, and I am simply afraid of that unknown. If I choose that life, I cannot go back to my family ever again because then I would have to explain why I left. I do not understand either why it is so difficult for me to communicate with my family. Yes, I would try to prevent them from knowing. But people would not be able to tell that I acted differently if different people are present because I have a personality that I show my family as well as personality that I show other non-family people. you are old enough to make decisions by yourself. Perhaps you can make an excuse to leave the house and go talk to someone about this? Your school might have options. You say yourself you have nothing to lose at this point, and throwing yourself on the streets might be a bit too drastic if you have not exhausted all your options yet. U can message me too if it helps btw. Cannot promise we will be friends, but I have got sm resources and suggestions. I cannot leave the house because no one leaves unless everyone else knows their destination and route. My school may have some options for me, but I would only be able to communicate with them in text. I am also nervous about that because it would be the first time someone knows my real name and that I have SM. I may be able to overcome that though with a huge effort. It took so much out of me to put this on the internet. and it is good that you did. \n\nFrom what you have written thus far, i can see that you are able to clearly express thoughts, feelings, etc in this format. Just that alone is a major communication asset. It seems like the biggest issue is that you feel stuck and you feel controlled by expectations and routine.  There are definitely things you can do to alleviate these feelings.  My therapist calls them acceptable social excuses to do what you feel you need to do for your mental health.  Go on vacation, do a retreat, sign up for a few-months volunteer gig in exchange for room and board, go on a long camping trip.  Getting away without your family seems like it would be helpful for you.  And feeling the need to get away and get some clarity is quite a normal adult thing, especially for young adults. These problems are in your head. You need to relax and see things thoroughly for what they really are. Saying you will kill your family is dumb and attention seeking. You are fine and you just need to grow up. Stop caring about what people think of you and start looking at life in a new lens. Selective mutism has done you no favors for 23 years and it is finally time to let it go. No more games, no more coping mechanisms, no more charades. You are too old for this now. Yep, I cannot explain anything either....I can a little, but not in any developed way....and my Mom does not understand that. And I tell her she does not understand anything.\n\nShe always tries to find a defense for why she does.......there is no defense needed. It is called being helpfully effective; her defending herself is not needed and just demoralizing as......everything I 'tell her' is ignored. The only thing I have is the journal I keep each fucking day. I will probably eventually kill myself, although I do not want to. She will treat me to the same respect as a normal person sometimes when she is angry......adn that does not help, it massively stunts any sort of progress.....which the only time I had good progress is when I was infatuated by this girl in the summer, and I still am, now I am not as motivated because I realize how unattainable it is.....plus I am OCD with &gt;!sex !&lt;shit...so there is that.\n\n(The above I was read, halfway through)\n\nI have also always felt like I am crazy beyond, SM. I am like you, the only thing is I am in college still at 18....but when I had that motivation in the summer, it was insanely good for me........\n\nI think the best chance I would have to change would be to go out into the world on my own (My SM is heavily induced in my family, as yours is).....my SM is dealable with strangers, but I just am not one to make conversation..........unless it is with actual friends but it is been since 2019 since I have consistently socialized with friends, that was the only normal area of communication (or as normal as it ever was).......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am trapped to stick to my family, although really I would not mind being on my own, if I was able to be....and did not have crippling contamination OCD...which is another reason why I could not......I could not survive more than a day or two on my own, because if I have to use the bathroom more than &gt;!peeing!&lt;....I have to shower after. And washing my clothes, idk how I would go about that because I find dirty clothed gross.\n\nAnyway that is it....I am just going on....I have been good the last few days...well not really, but for the moment.....in time I will subside to the loneliness and sorrow again but until then......I am just doing HW and watching the World Series.......and Pokemon Card Videos......putting together Juice WRLD Unreleased albums.......and playing Minecraft where I run a shop in this pixelmon server (when I play the server)....that is it.\n\nThat is my life. I read your post and I relate to it.....but I also think just how fucking stupid it is. It is so dumb from the outside. I have to really lean my situation on perceiving 'normal life' as the abnormal people in life....although they are not.....it sucks to be shot gunned into the abyss of a stuck minority....but that is where I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I feel like my parents hold me back, especially my Mom....Dad next.....Mom is crazy. I hate stigmas, and that is what they have of me, a lot of them.....stigmas are stupid as hell.......I also do not go out anywhere on my own accord, unless it is known to anyone else.....because 'I would not do that.' I live my life to other's perceptions....although in my mind, I do not want to.\n\nI listen to Juice WRLD, but no one besides me knows I do....or that I like Ariana Grande.....they know shit about me. I also hate how 'a son' is a parent's......no, I am my own person, you just birthed me......There are so many things I would do different if I was a parent. I think my Parents were horrible parents. I turned out fine, but I am stuck where I am now. On the path to death. It is a fucked life.\n\nI hate knowing people, because then there is expectations.  Yep, if I have any pretense that my interaction with someone will get back to my family, I avoid it.\n\nThat is probably why I do not know if I can interact with strangers normally or not, because I am so afraid of my family knowing about it.\n\nAnd these things, I will never type to them or tell them these specific reasons, which is a shame....if I was motivated liek I was in the summer then maybe. \n\nI think you are the most like me, that I have seen here.....although my outside personality I really have no concept of as I have no means to practice it. I have had success with university services and GP. Maybe you can ask for one in a medical centre so you can say you are going there?  Often you can book appointments online and request specific sessions (over the phone, maybe text?). \n\nIt took multiple sessions for me to feel comfortable talking about my experiences. Just know that they are trained to help and recognize distress, and their job is to help you with that distress. \n\nNow even if I do not feel like talking I will go in and my counsellor will talk more than usual sessions. I will just shrug/look away/nod to convey what I am feeling (or just sit and cry). Sometimes I will write words down. Sometimes even just sharing that I am distressed with someone, and have someone recognise that distress, helps enough to get me through. \n\nSometimes I will also write a list of everything I want to discuss, and bring that in with me and hand it over. how about some online therapy / counseling service? Were you abused or neglected? Your family seems to have too much control over your life \nUsually with selective mutism people can talk more comfortably in front of their family not the other way around. Our son was diagnosed with SM we took him to the Smart Center in PA - they know how to treat SM better than anyone - we signed him up for therapy and the results after two 3 day sessions were nothing short of miraculous- you are an adult, you can reach out an make an appointment to speak with a therapist. The treatment also included training family members how to help him transition to the talking world- before we went there he would only sign and speak with family members- he is not thrilled to speak but now he has the tools to do it and move forward in his life. There are also medications to help treat this social anxiety disorder- one that is readily available is high potency full spectrum CBD. Good Luck.", "Here is a selective mutism info document I made a while ago. Figured some of you might find it useful  I have 100% of the symptoms but I have not been formally diagnosed. The sooner you get diagnosed the sooner you can get help. Please feel free to message me and I will give you some communication tips so you can communicate with the doctor. I do not have a psychiatrist, plus my parents are not really the biggest believers in mental health. If I tell them, I will probably be told to just talk more. You only need to go to your general practitioner (GP) to get a diagnosis or at least a referral to get diagnosed The unable to communicate, even nonverbally is so important. Many people would be like just why do not you just write what you want to say down or a therapist would be like \"Let us start with something easy... a board game\" and I am just sitting there shrinking into myself, unable to even blink let alone move my hands to play a board game. Yeah, that is why I wanted to add that to it. I had the same struggles. Too many people do not realize it effects nonverbal communication too. I still remember getting told \u201cwhy cannot you just write it down!\u201d in school, and them quickly losing their patience because they thought I was doing it on purpose. my parents were the same. hard being mentally ill with parents like that, good luck. I know self dx is controversial and I am neither here nor there on it but if you find hanging out in the \"community\" helpful then I think you should even if you are not officially dx'd yet", "Selective Mutism is not a choice  This is beautifully worded...

Many people with SM describe their throat \"tightening/closing up\" due to anxiety, so you definitely arent alone on that. Sometimes when I am not anxious it still feels tight, even hours after I have gotten home. Why is that?  I am afraid I have no idea, maybe ask a speech pathologist K Consider getting your vocal chords checked by an ENT. I learned that I have PVFD, which is really common in speech therapy, and when I was told it was treatable it felt like a damn miracle.\n\nIt is having bad reflexes in your vocal chords.

Before sleep it goes away and next day it again comes", "how can i help my brother is 12 years old and i am beginning to think he is selectively mute.\n\nto make it clear: i have mentioned this to my parents before but they brushed it off as him being socially awkward and needing time to adjust or whatever. but if he is selectively mute i want to know what i can do to support him as a sibling and friend. now, i am not looking to \u201cfix\u201d him as i do not think that is my place in the slightest and it has yet to impact him in a way that is had negative feedback.  \n\ni began questioning him when he asked me to go to school conference with him and our mom. i said yes, not sure why but i did, i went. he is a good student, smart, i am very proud of him and i try to express that the best i can as our parents are the \u201cthat is great but with some more studying you could be even better\u201d type, they are proud but they are perfectionist and being the first born i know sometimes you just want to hear \u201cgood job\u201d every now and again. \n\nanyways, when we got there we shook hands with his homeroom teacher and took a seat while she showed us a file of his work. she mentioned how he improved his math scores a lot and even seemed to be enjoying himself, she turned and asked him \u201cAre you liking math?\u201d \n\nhe did not respond in the slightest, not to her anyways. he look back at us like he was an actor who forgot his line. he plays video games a lot with his headset on so i figured he just had a moment where he did not hear zip. i repeated the question and while only looking at me he said \u201cyea, i guess\u201d\n\nevery time she asked him a question as simple as what type of books or video games he liked he would look at me and not her. when he did respond to her it was just a quick nod or a shrug. i thought he was just overwhelmed and anxious so i answered most of the questions about his personal life without looking pushy.\n\ni thought it was odd, i had never seen him like that. at home he is very loud, sarcastic and even a little blunt in a comedic sense. he makes short films with his friends where he plays an on screen character, he talks outside the house too but i guess i never really noticed that he really only talks to me and our parents. \n\nnow that i have been thinking about it i think back to times when i figured he was just being awkward. like at church when someone asks him how his week was and he will just stare and shrug while making little to no eye contact, or sometime when my parents are talking to him in the car he will just look at me as a way of letting me know he does not want to talk and wants to do it for him- usually he is in a mood but he will still talk a little to me, or when he is playing his video games and has the head set with mic on. he mumbles a lot, can barely understand him but he is not usually that mumbly with us. sometimes he will ask me to hang out with him while he plays, he likes the audience, and then he will ask me to talk through the mic for him and i will do it because i am bored. i think he would ask me more if it were not for the fact that i do not understand a thing about video games and often forget to repeat whatever\u2019s being said back to him.  \n\nand i have asked him if he thought maybe he was purposely not responding the folks because he was anxious or uncomfortable or felt like he physically could not and just claimed that he was shy but i have my doubts. \n\nhe and i are very close and frankly he is my best friend. i have my own anxiety driven mental illnesses and even have a stutter so i do not like to push him into anything that might bother him as i have a good idea of what that might be like.\n\nif he is not selectively mute that is just as good, or just means he is an awkward guy and i can work with him if he wants to from one awkward guy to another but if he i want to know what i can do as someone who does not fully understand why he does the things he does.  Have you mentioned selective mutism to him? Do his parents know if he was like this as a yonuger child (eg. 7/8 year old). There are website with symptom lists, maybe some things in this subreddits wiki page.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sounds a little bit like me at that age, able to talk in some sitations (eg. with friends) but having trouble in formal situations or to people in authority (eg. teachers).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough SM can get better 'with age' treatments (talking therapies such as cbt, speech and language classes to raise confidence or medication) have been proven to be generally effective at releiving symptoms, even if it is just social anxiety, social anxiety can also be helped with therapies if that is what he wants. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven just being someone to talk to about his worries is helpful though and personally i found that having someone i knew in situations with me allowed me to feel more confident, as if i was 'borrowing some of their confidence' as i described it.\n\n&amp;#x200B; thank you for the response, yes i have mentioned it but i did not want to overwhelm him so i did not push it much after he brushed it off. i would love it if he saw a therapist or counsellor, i see one for my own stuff and yes it does really help knowing you have someone but i am afraid it will not happen with him. my parents are stubborn and see it as somewhat insulting, they are just a product of their time and not purposely trying to be so close minded. i am just curious, is there something you felt you truly could have benefitted from at this age when struggle with selective mutism but did not receive for whatever reason? i want to be his support system but i do not to start something he is not interested in? y\u2019know? I am the sibling with the history of mental health issues and now my brother's going through his own issues, so I feel you with not wanting to \"push it\". I had SM as a kid and teenager until I ended up at residential treatment. If there is something I wish people around me would have done differently before treatment, it would be to not give up on my ability to communicate just because I was not speaking.\n\nA lot of the time I was just excluded from things or other people spoke for me without my permission. I thought it was great at the time because I did not have to do things that were scary. Only in hindsight I can see that this was harmful for me. When my SM was at my worst, I was too petrified to even communicate through writing things down and only spoke to 4 people. When my SM was at it is best, I was giving one word responses to my peers and teachers in school. There was a lot of grey area in between, but the more I avoided, the closer I got to the worst version of my SM and the more anxious I was.\n\nI am sure you only have so much influence in his life, but if you are ever in another situation where he is looking at you to avoid his anxiety or if he ever seems to expect you to speak for him, maybe ask him if it is OK for you to leave the situation for a moment or if it is OK that he speaks for himself, or even writes down what he needs to say. It is possible that phrasing it as a question will come across less like pressure and more like encouragement to be less avoidant. If he says no that is OK, but I think it might help him feel a bit more confident if he is reminded that he has some choice.\n\nOverall, I think the most helpful thing for me was learning how anxiety works, how it impacts me, and how to confront it in CBT. Once I understood that I was making my anxiety worse through SM, I was more motivated to fight it through exposure therapy. You cannot force someone to do therapy, but if he ever starts to experience that sort of curiosity about why he is \"shy\" and if there is anything he can do to change it, it might help to show him an article or video about how anxiety works or how it is treated. Or just tell him about what you know about the topic if he is willing to listen. Maybe he is not there yet, but I feel like most people with anxiety disorders will eventually reach a point where they start trying to become more self-aware about their issues.\n\nI do not know if any if this would be helpful, but I figure it is better to throw in my 2 cents than 0 cents. Hope all goes well with you and your brother. First of all, you sound like an awesome big brother. Keep it up. I had a stutter that quickly progressed to SM as a kid and it lingered for a long time. I think the biggest things that would have helped would of been just patience and support. Do not exclude him or stop asking questions of him assuming he just wont answer. also maybe consider encouraging your parents to find a professional for him to work with. does not matter what label you give it if he is struggling with SM or anxiety or whatever, it never hurts to get a little help from a pro. Otherwise just love, patience, and acceptance bro. Assume he is doing his best and let him know your there no matter what (:", "Starting speech therapy My school recently was able to make arrangements so I can start seeing to a therapist with experience in SM. The thought of speaking normally is really exciting, but at the same time, I almost do not want to. Has anyone else felt this way? What was it like starting recovery? i 100% feel like that. the idea of being able to speak normally is so appealing, but the process of having to conquer so many anxieties in order to do so, is so awful to imagine. My favorite thing was learning to harness the anxious energy and turn it into excited energy and that anxiousness is part of the process and may always be a part of the process. No matter how great I get, there are days that are hard. Once in a while someone will say that other people light up when I talk to them and open up more than they otherwise would. I do try to include others in conversation who I see are feeling outsider ish, but when it happens unintentionally I feel like all the hard work I have put in was worth it. That is really cool that you are getting support. It is natural to have mixed feelings, though. When you have been one way for a long time, it is hard to change things, even when you know it is a good change. It is not quite the same as I never had specific SM help, but I used to get super anxious before going to every session of therapy for PTSD. But I am so glad I pushed through and did the work. It was not always fun, but it was so so worthwhile. With both that and recovery from SM I am really proud of my progress and happy I faced my fears. I do not feel like my anxiety rules my life anymore. \n\nYou can think of it as a gift to your future self. You will look back and thank yourself for doing the work and being kind to yourself. \n\nWishing you the best on your road.", "Not mute but still very quiet. So I had selective mutism as a kid for 10 years where I was unable to speak outside of my family. Even though I no longer have actual mutism (only very rarely). Now being an adult in my 30s. I still have mutism tendencies. I am very quiet and sometimes do not feel comfortable talking or socializing in regular work school situations. But I do not get into a mode where I literally cannot speak. It just becomes hard to socialize and come up with things to say. So I do not say much. Anyone relate?", "(Quote) ", "Is it selective mutism when it is triggered by an event? I am going through a though time right now because of a sad event. I went from super talkative and happy (around my friends and family, still had major social anxiety), to completely mute within a couple days. You would have to see a therapist but trauma is ome of the causes of selevtive mutism. Thanks Good luck with whatever you are dealing with. I wish the best for you! Per Dr Steven Kurtz, a leading expert in SM, SM is NOT caused by trauma. He is very clear about this in the courses he and his team deliver every year. \n\nPer the diagnosis standard: \n\n\\- Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations when speaking is expected (e.g. school) despite speaking in other settings (e.g. home). \n\n\\- Impairment in educational/occupational achievement or social communications \n\n\\- greater than one month and not limited to the first month of school \n\n\\- Not due to lack of knowledge or comfort with the spoken language required in the social situation \n\n\\- Not Communication disorder \n\n\\- Not exclusively during PDD, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorder Oh, thank you! Just coming back from parents training session about SM. They said following factors cause SM in combination:\n\n1. Predisposing factors: example. Genetic factors - family anxiety history, bilingual, underlying issues of speech and language etc.\n\n2. Trigger: Starting school, migration, change of environment, self aware of speech and language impairment, teasing\n\n3. Maintaining factors: People branding kids as shy, will not talk, lack of intervention, family putting too much emphasis on speech etc.\n\n\nHence, I believe there is trigger for SM. I believe even PTSD can be a trigger for SM. Sounds like me. 1. My family is almost the same way 2. Was fine until I started going to preschool 3.

My childhood was not like 'normal' children's. I was the quietest and the most immobile child you could ever see. In the early years of school I was mute and physically slow. My teachers thought that I had low IQ because I was such unresponsive so they refered me to a psychiatrist to give me an IQ test. However, it turned out that I am gifted as I scored in top 2% of population. Moreover, I got diagnosed with autism, attention deficit disorder and selective mutism. My parents never fully accepted my diagnosis so they did not search out for further treatment. I got good grades but I felt physically unable to raise my hand and ask a question in class. Also, I had been a loner most of my school life because I felt physically unable to speak. I was devastated because I was blended in the background and forgotten there in school, I sometimes wanted to vanish like a perfume spreading through the air and escaping from the window. My existence had been dismissed most of the time. I have always felt like a misfit. Selective mutism is extremely underrated, as most people do not even heard of the name of this, they tend to assume that mute people are just stubborn, arrogant, rude, boring or stupid. As I have never taken treatment for selective mutism, I am still trying to overcome this in spite of people mocking me. I was completely mute in early childhood then in my late childhood and the beginning of my teenage years I became able to say approximately 10 words every day in school, by the time passing words turned into sentences and sentences turned into paragraphs. Now I am 20 (about to turn 21) and in college I am able to talk in class, even sometimes join debates, and make articulate presentations in front of class, and have conversations with friends. However, I still cannot say that I overcome selective mutism 100%, there are still times that I feel physically stuck to talk but they happen much less. Despite this, I am still untalkative compared to an average person. Also having autism makes it hard for me to understand social dynamics of groups and relationships, I still have problems with facial expressions, tone of voice and body language so I might appear socially awkward. Regardless of the struggles I face, I am still hopeful about my journey as I am improving myself. I might not had been be able to run as neurotypical people at the start of my journey but I first learnt how to crawl and now I can stand on my own feet and one day I will run.

This sub is a little dead, but I figured I would try it. \n\nI am currently co-leading an anxiety group for teenagers. One of the teens in my group has selective mutism. I figure it is quite impressive that they even attend the group, and I do not want to force them to speak if they are not ready. However, I would like to find a way they can participate, even if it is not verbal. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions, activities, or experience that could help me in my work with these teens? TIA.  If I were participating in groups/activities, I would have preferred to be an outsider watching. It was still fun to be around because I would not have been the center of the spotlight.\n\nRemember they can communicate through writing, gestures or facial expressions. It really depends on their level of comfort and if they want to directly participate.\n\nI suppose you could just ask privately and see if they have any suggestions or not. It was still nice to get \"involved\" if there was no direct participation. One of the most annoying things to deal with was having people ask why I was even there if I did not speak (in their views I was not valuable enough to stay around). Even attending a group setting with anxiety can be a challenge. Luckily this group would seem to be more welcoming. I think selective mutes want to be a fly on the wall.  In my experience they are able to listen very well and can focus.  They want to be a part of activities and groups but just do not want to talk. You may email the person after the session and see what questions or thoughts they may have about the session.   I know I am late but let him or her decide I hate when people ask stuff and almost force me to do something by suggesting me many things, sometimes I just wan't to be there. If that person is anything like me just ask This is a really late response but\n\na lot of people with selective mutism do not know how or want to talk about themselves (i.e. their likes or dislikes) maybe unless someone says it first.\n\nI think most people are inclined to just allow them to not speak and not ask them to speak. They may be extremely uncomfortable with speaking but, especially since this person is a teenager, I believe that it is better to call on them to speak (in the form of a question) every once in a while to help them get used to it. This is because they will get used to being mute making it harder (and, at that age, near impossible!) for them to escape it. I think that the term for this is \"stimulus fading.\" If they have severe selective mutism the moment that they are \"ready\" may never happen. \n\nIf they answer the question with I do not know or answer it generically, perhaps try asking a follow-up question as they might have an answer for that. (i.e. \"What kind of music do you listen to?\" \"I do not know.\" \"Have you heard any of Radiohead?\" \"Do you have any pets?\" \"Yes. Just a dog.\" \"What kind of dog is it?\")\n\nI am not a professional these are just personal experiences that I think may have helped me as a person who has been mute in most situations from being a toddler to now as a freshman. Selective mutism center aka smart center in Philadelphia. Follow their Facebook page and website. They really helped my daughter and were a great resource for my husband and me.  I once worked at a school with a preteen who had selective mutism. I was filling in for someone else, and somehow being a \"new\" person made it easier for her anyway. We decided to play Apples to Apples (along with 3 other kids none of which had SM). That went over REALLY well. It allowed her to participate without saying a word! Furthermore, it got her to engage with and interact with other kids. Some of her \"answers\" were really creative/funny. I cannot say for sure, but I think getting the other kids to giggle at a witty answer gave her some confidence. She even smiled a few times! It is worth a try!

I have never had any situation transition that triggers selective mutism (like home -&gt; school, etc.) but I have noticed sometimes when I am having a conversation &amp; something upsets me it becomes nearly/actually impossible to speak about it. &amp; it is a little bit more than just \"this is an uncomfortable conversation I would rather not have\" it is more like I know what I want to say, I want to say it, but when I try to say it there is a mental block or something cause it does not come out &amp; I will sit there thinking \"say it, say it, why are not you saying it\"  \nThe thing is it will happen depending on the subject matter of conversation, no who I am speaking to, or surrounding setting.  I will be speaking with people I am really close to &amp; feel safe around &amp; suddenly I just cannot say one thing in particular out of the conversation\n\nHas anyone heard of selective mutism presenting like this? Does this sound like SM to anyone who is familiar with it? So far I have been able to type messages of what I want to say &amp; communicate that way, but looking to identify what this phenomena is so I can hopefully find out how to get better at working through it (I find it quite frustrating lol ) I have not experienced it like that, but I believe selective mutism is caused by anxiety, so if a topic of conversation is upsetting you, it would make sense to me that that could trigger selective mutism. Topics that give me stress or make me highly emotional make it harder to talk about.\n\nMy partner gets pissed at me sometimes for talking to them about talking to them about difficult topics while they play video games, but sometimes it is the only time I feel comfortable broaching them because their attention is physically focused away from myself. (I only figured this out doing a friend\u2019s hair once when they could not physically turn around to face me while I was also trying to talk to them about something emotionally charged).\n\nOnce I figured this out I realized I can also sit back to back or hold their hand during these types of conversations (or just tell them that it is physically impossible for me to have these conversations face to face but sometimes people forget this in the moment and still try to make eye contact which just clams me up again).\n\nIt is not like I am even thinking about it, just like an invisible shield comes up in my throat and my voice is cut off.

Hello everyone,\n\nI have had issues with mutism since I was young. It has evolved into more anxiety, and I have long periods where I am unable to talk in person.\n\nI have a hard time conveying this to people. They think I am just nervous so I am not talking. I tell them I am not trying to be quiet. I love playing devil's advocate and love seeing why. I always ask questions. When I get quiet it is not because I want to. It does not seem to click with some people even explaining part of it.\n\nOne problem is physical presence seems to be part of it. If my roommate is in her room and not around me, we can talk over voice chat. She shows up in my room I clam up. I have no explanation. I dislike it. I know reasons for it are varied but I cannot explain why it happens to me with that specific scenario.\n\nI do not know how to explain these things and since an event a few years ago these problems have gotten worse. I dislike the idea that people may think I am snubbing them. \nPreviously when I went quiet I would just withdraw. I do not have that capability anymore. \n\nThis is partially a rant and partially asking for help. I already know one of my roommates thinks I am faking and it  is no fun.

I never know how to tell people that I am not being petty, arrogant, or plain snooty when I am not talking, words just fail me in a social settings sometimes. Even my best friends do not know what SM is, they just understand that I am \u201csocially awkward\u201d with a splash of anxiety. \n\nI really do not know what to tell you in regards to conveying your SM to those in your lives and I am so sorry. Until we live in a world where there is more representation of SM that can reach those who do not have it, it is a very difficult message to convey that some of us suffer from this disorder that makes life so much harder for us. \n\nSorry again that this reply is sort of a downer.

Downer or not.  Thank you.", "When I gave up on trying to talk   Being incapable of speaking in public is a hard thing, although not being able to speak with someone you like when you are in a public space is much worse. The problem is all about talking. Talking with someone that is not part of your close family- or, maybe, a friend if you are lucky. \n\n  I am 16 and today I kind of gave up on trying to talk. At first, when I was just a kid, I could talk only to my parents, sister and a friend, I did not use to try to talk, so I just got silent when someone tried to speak with me, if it was a question I usually would answer \"uhum\"- for a \"yes\"- or \"um um\"- for a \"no\". Growing up was hard, but my \"mutism\" did not stop me from doing what I liked. I liked to play soccer and I was pretty good, although no sound came out of my mouth, but I guess my friends understood this (I was lucky having such good friends). I made some some friends in my Growing way. Although now I have no friends. My classmates are still pretty understanding on me and sometimes I tried to talk. \n  Now I have a 7 years old brother and he is such an amazing person (he has some child problems, like not hearing my parents and, even, yelling to them) and I love him. He likes everything that I like- probably because of my influence on him- and we are always together. My sister, 20, is, maybe, as adorable as him. We may like different things, but she is always on my side and she is, probably, the person that understands me the most. \n  You are, probably thinking why am I giving up on talking to different people, it is simple: most of the people do not understand my incapacibility on talking and it is been over 2 years since I started treatments on this \"shyness\" and nothing changed- maybe it is worse. Six months ago I said to my parents if I could go to a psychiatrist- since the last treatment was like astrology. So here I am completely equal to 2 years ago taking stupid medications and wondering why I am not at an Asylum being accused of killing a cotton candy. Is it that hard to do a diagnosis and then my parents would say something like: \"Hey, he has 'bla bla bla' so if you want to talk to him be concious that he is, probably, not going to answer you, but try it may be good to him\". And, then, everyone would understand me since it is too hard for me to use words and I am never able to show my feelings and thoughts.\n  So if this happy ending cannot happen, then sorry but I am tired of this, it is easier to just shut my mouth and never say a word. I am sorry, maybe writing your thoughts down like you did here and making a journal for your parents. Saying things like they will not talk but try anyway is setting you up for failure. I hope people in your life take the time to encourage you whenever you do talk. I do not think I can understand what you are going through. I really wish a did (I have an SM kid). I am sorry that some have such a hard time - this is just so very unfair. I wish somehow, sometime the tide turns in your favour and you feel something different going on. Maybe a new beginning is yet to come, maybe an old challenge that made you feel defeated until now will then present itself in an entirely different light at some point. Maybe give it some time, just give yourself a break. Maybe your resolution to speak is in the back burner right now, but might as well resurface again at the right time.\n\nPersonally, I never give up on anything important to me.

I am a university student who volunteers for a local non for profit organization where we tutor kids from vulnerable backgrounds for free. I consider myself pretty good with kids ( I am told by this by many people) I was recently paired to tutor a child in grade 2 in reading and writing. We are assigned a work book we are supposed to try and go through. I was told he was \"quiet\" and \"shy\"  before we started and thought that would be fined since I have worked with many quiet kids. However when we started I realized he was not willing to say a single word.  I was able to communicate by getting him to nod or shake his head, hold up numbers with his fingers or point to things I wrote. He was willing to respond to me by writing at times,  however his writing is limited at this point so getting him to write down a response is hard since he cannot spell many things.\n\nI basically abandoned the workbook we have since it was a lot of reading comprehension and I did not know how to ensure he was understand what we were reading since he would not say anything and we just worked on writing tasks. Basically I  forced information out of him by asking yes or no questions and then I would write sentences to correspond to what we were discussing.  I would then ask him to copy down what I wrote and I would read it out loud slowly, and then ask him to point to a specific words in the sentence. We talked about vowels a bit and I asked him to underline the vowels in words, etc.   I found out AFTER our first tutoring session he had selective mutism.  (this was a bit of a relief because I honestly felt that he hated me) \n\n I wanted to try and prepare myself a bit for the next session a bit better and do a bit of research but I also kind of wanted some personal advice on tutoring and communicating with kids with selective mutism? Anyone here have advice? First of all, you are such a great person to even try to seek for advice to help him; you are doing great already. \n\nSecondly, I think from what I can tell he is willing to learn but his SM makes it harder for both of you. Personally I have found iPad or something similar to type things up or have flash cards that have basic answers like yes/no/i do not know, could be helpful. \nAlso a side note, I personally had trouble asking to go to the bathroom for a long time as a kid, so having one that said \u201ccan I go to the bathroom\u201d helped a lot. \n\nOther than that I feel like you are already helping him a lot! :) He definitely seems willing to learn. He was receptive to all the things I did with him. It is just hard because there is a huge communication barrier, one that I was not prepared for at all when I started with him. I feel bad because initially I was pressuring him to speak which I have read is not a good thing to do. Fortunately I stopped after I realized there was no point. \n\nThank you for the suggestion about the iPad/flash cards I thinks that is a great idea. Right now I am looking into  apps that might be useful. \n\nAnd yeah, I regularly asked if he wanted to take a break, get a snack or go to the bathroom. Even with kids who do not have SM they can sometimes get nervous about  asking to go to the bathroom. That is good to know! \n\nI hope my suggestion works, I will try to find an app that could help also and let you know if I find any. \n\nAhh you are so awesome for that! I hope we get an update on you guys! :) Lots of good resources out there.  Look into fade-ins, CDI and VDI.\n\nAsk simple choice questions (as opposed to open-ended questions) that do not allow for a yes or no answer (e.g., do you want me to read the red book or the blue book right now, or neither?\u201d).  Yes or no questions invite the child to nod or shake their head, which unfortunately is not encouraging them to speak.  Open ended questions are probably a bridge too far from the outset.  Choice questions encourage vocalization with simple responses. \n\nAllow 5 seconds (literally count them) after each question so the child can comfortably reply.  Do not rush him/her.\n\nOffer positive reinforcement every time you get a response (e.g., \u201cthank you for telling me that you want to read the red book.  Let us read!\u201d).  Since you are tutoring, be careful about correcting wrong answers\u2014 you do not want to make the child anxious about vocalizing for fear of being wrong (e.g., do not say, \u201cthat is wrong, 1+1 does not equal 3.\u201d  Say, \u201c3 is a good guess, but we can probably get even closer.  Let us try again, what is 1+1?\u201d\n\n Thank you  much for all of this. Honestly you have really helped me. I really appreciate it. I think it is sweet you are learning about this to help the child. As for advice I am using my experience and how I wish I was helped. I would say to be patient with the child and develop a system of communicating non verbally for example gestures that mean certain things. And be understanding of the child  do not expect them to talk to you right away or after a few months. I do not know if my advice would help but I hope it does and I hope the kid is doing well Augmented/Assisted Communication Apps are a *great* idea! There is actually a ton of free ones out there... but they are almost universally terrible. On the other hand, that might be a GOOD thing in this case--it will let him communicate, and yet strongly encourage him to use his voice instead of the talker. I trained as a child and youth worker. Children being silent can also be a result of trauma, and we found ways to get around it and allow them to speak their minds in simple, yet strong ways to convey their message, even if it is just a simple yes or no.\nOne thing I used to do, is get 3 coins. One representative of yes, another of no, another of I am not sure. The child would move those coins accordingly. The questions the coins represent can change as well, for example, the first coin can be step 1 of a math problem , 2nd being step 2, 3rd being step 3, or all the coins if you do not understand at all.\n\nWalls can be passed, you just need a key.

Definitely. Most mental whatchamacallits are umbrella terms defined by their symptoms, so it can be difficult to say exactly who belongs where. I mean just look at the autism spectrum. Temple Grandinsure, I mean sure ... but Anthony Hopkins!? I think what best defines the experience for me or at least what I and others have experienced in particular is this childhood stone facing. I mean like, kids with SM when confronted by an adult or senior they are not comfortable with will freeze up. Will not speak, will not let any facial expression slip. Scared out of their little minds, but you would not know it from the outside. It is like you said, they just look like they are acting defiant. \n\nNot the same context\u2014 obviously.

You are not comfortable around extroverts but speak at work because you simply have to or you could loose your job.

So I do not totally have no support but I come from a very small conservative town and people kind of treat me like a circus attraction when they see me at work, especially people I went to high school with.

Not gatekeeping but, if your trauma is significant, it may not get better on its own. You may only develop negative coping mechanisms. Like not speaking. So, I would recommend you seek out professional help if that is an option for you. Best of luck.

I do not even know if I truly have SM but moments like these really seem to make me think I do. My dad for some reason was adamant that me and my brothers solve this trigonometry problem. He called us all to come and go through the problem with him. He asked us a really simple question about what an angle\u2019s measurement was and none of us said anything. It was like simple basic trig yet I did not say anything cause of this stupid SM. And for some reason my brothers did not say anything either. I do not think they have SM, they talk way more than I do (though that is not saying much) but they just did not care enough to answer probably. So my dad took everyone is silence as \u201cwe do not know the answer.\u201d He just fucking assumes we are all idiots because we are silent. It never crosses his mind that we just do not want to answer, or in my case that I cannot answer. So then he starts getting frustrated that we do not know and then walks away for a minute. I take that time to write the down answer so I can show him when he comes back. But when I show him for some reason he demands that I explain how I got it. I could not thanks to my SM, and my brothers were standing around silently which only further triggers my mutism, and he took the pencil so I could not write down the explanation to show him. So I just stood there silently as he went off on this rant about \u201cwow I cannot believe you do not know such a simple problem, how do you expect to go to college and pursue sciences if you do not know this\u201d despite the fact that I DO fucking know. I literally wrote the answer right there but he just did not believe I knew how to get it without me explaining it verbally. And then when I walked away I heard him ranting to my mom about \u201cI cannot believe it what are they teaching kids these days\u201d. I just fucking hate people like my dad who just absolutely require that you give them verbal confirmation to understand something. I am not an idiot (or at least not academically) but I am really bad at speaking, but to people like my dad there is apparently no fucking difference. \n\nAnd maybe this sounds silly to others to get upset about, but I have always been insecure about the fact that I am quiet and socially inept. People look down on me for that and treat me like a little child. The only thing I have to my name that gives me even the slightest bit of dignity is intellect, so moments like these where people see me as stupid really hit hard for me cause at that point there is nothing respectable about me and I might as well just be a tiny helpless baby to them. I just wish people could respect other\u2019s limitations and not expect them to be perfect at everything and not judge them entirely based on their ability to talk. But sadly people like my dad exist who absolutely refuse to acknowledge your strengths unless you can verbally prove them. It fuckin sucks :(", "My struggle with SM (who can relate?) Hi everyone! I know this is quite long, but I think it is definitely worth reading for anyone who has SM or social anxiety in general because I share some of my insights in here that I have thought about for years of living with both of these things.\n\nSo I do not have a diagnosis of selective mutism but my mom is a psychologist and has known I have had SM since the age of 4. She decided not to get me diagnosed, due to her belief of disorders and the human brain being very fluid and changeable especially while you are young and she did not want me it negatively affect my life or stop be from being able to do things.\nI showed signs from the age of 4 and apparently would burst into tears whenever exposed to situations I found uncomfortable which is a clear sign of struggle to regulate my emotions.\n\nNow, I can regulate my emotions for the most part and selective mutism usually effects me at school, in lessons. I am now almost 18 years old and have never ever raised my hand in class; I never volunteer to answer questions. Luckily, when a teachers picks on me to answer a question I can usually give a short answer but it fills me with extreme anxiety and never gets easier.\nWhenever I am in group situations where I do not know or am not good friends with every single person, I am in constant fight or flight mode causing me to practically feel frozen and just completely uncomfortable - unable to initiate any conversation. Another example of this is when I went on a week long class trip to the UK when I was still relatively new to the school and actually knew nobody on the trip. I had to sit in car for 5 hour journeys every day full of all my classmates who felt like strangers, just chatting to each other. I did not say a word to any of them for an entire week. I felt embarrassed because I was so conscious of what they might be thinking of me as I was not engaging in conversation with them. Self consciousness is something I often deal with as part of a separate social anxiety problem - which exasperates the struggle of SM. \nBecause of probably only saying 2 words the whole week, and only to the teachers, my throat had become so dry and voice lost its projection. I could not even speak properly or at a normal volume to my parents when I finally returned home and they say my face had no emotion and I almost seemed dead inside. I also noticed that I would been surviving the whole week of the trip purely on adrenaline and ended up sleeping for like 2 days straight to regain energy when I got home.\n\n I hate having SM because despite the anxiety I am actually someone who has a lot to say, and absolutely loves socialising which makes it every harder not feeling able to. I would not consider myself an extrovert because socialising still drains me more than it gives me energy, but it is definitely something I enjoy. \nI also suffer with OCD, which as a disorder, is very linked to SM, because the whole idea of SM is controlling your anxiety by choosing not to speak, and once that habit is formed and the fear is fed even more it begins to really feel like you cannot physically speak. \n\nFor me, everything in my body language appears confident to others, as I, without thinking, laugh during group discussions, and use facial expressions... basically everything except for my voice. I notice that many people are confused by me as I appear as someone who they know is able to speak but for some reason does not. It is often confused with being shy, which for me is such an arbitrary word which I do not know whether to associate with or not but I do know that when in large and unfamiliar groups, I am in a constant internal state of anxiety and general discomfort. Because I do not have any diagnosis, none of my teachers have ever understood why I am always silent in their classes because even a shy person would warm up to the environment and begin to progressively speak more and be themselves. Whereas I consistently have remained silent for almost 13 school years and have never been able to be myself. This upsets me as I wish I could have been able to make the most of my school life rather than daily counting down until the end of class as soon as I enter a classroom. \nMy perspective on this is that crazily school seeks to be the one place that is perfectly made to have maximum anxiety potential for children with anxiety in general but especially SM. Imagine spending the whole day hopping from class to class which for people with SM targets their weakness of talking. It  makes for a very \u201csilent\u201d day, every day.\nThe only times when I feel I can be myself is when I am alone with my family or friends. It is frustrating when I can see that the teacher is confused as to whether I am shy, disobedient, confused about the school work... some people have even questioned if I am depressed! \n\nAnyway, I just thought I would share my struggles with SM and I wonder if anyone can relate to some of the things I said?\ud83d\ude0c I can relate so much to what you said and I feel like one of the worst things about sm is the fact that it is so hard to be yourself around other people, and the constant struggle of not being able to express yourself. That just kind of sucks I just want to say that I work with a young lady with SM, and your words have helped me understand what she is going through. Thank you! I do not understand why your mom would not get help for you. I have had some speech stuff going on apparently forever, I have heard that I was a bit slow to speak, that people would get frustrated with me for it, especially my sister, when I was just starting to speak. My parents did research and stuff. That mostly fixed itself with my parents implementing stuff that I have found to be home based selective mutism techniques now many many years later. I was super social, to an annoying extent ngl, for a couple years. I was a normal curious kid, asking people what they were doing and so curious about how the world and the things and people in it worked. And then bullying set it back really bad and that is the selective mutism I have not recovered from and the one I can actually remember. I am pissed at my teachers, who saw me fall into silence and just daydreaming my way out of there, for not getting me into therapy or any sort of counseling or any form of working on the SM. I recognize that I could be so much better off if they did. I do not mean to be rude or anything, but I feel like your mom fucked up and she knows it, just like I hope my teachers do Hey, thanks for sharing, that is interesting. Also yeah I completely get what you are saying. It is just that my Mom is a psychologist and works with a lot of kids who have what I have/had so decided she would monitor me herself at home and did not make me aware of what I had because she did not want it to affect my childhood. She did put me in a motor skills therapy once a week though. I think it worked alright, and she thinks so too but a part of me also wonders how different my condition would be now had I really been treated and had I been aware of it when I was younger. Aw that makes me so happy! :) Exactly, 100% :( And when I was younger I always had this feeling that I was different or found communication harder than everyone else but had no idea why and could not put my finger on what it was. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d", "Apparel for kids &amp; parents Hello All.\nI am a designer that just had a child diagnosed with SM. I have realized that there are no choices out there for kids or parents that are dealing with this area. \n\nSeems that this could be really helpful for kids to use as reminders.\n\nCurious if there is any interest. What do you mean exactly? I think that tshirts with SM on them could be good for raising awareness, but I do not think kids with SM would necessarily want to wear them as casual clothes because they do not want to stand out from the crowd or bring attention to it.  (I know I am commenting this a bit late but whatever)...\n\nTry not to put much attention on the fact that they have SM, it makes them anxious and makes them feel different. I know that when I was a little younger I would go camping with my friends who knew I had SM but did not really put attention on it (if that even makes sense), and soon I felt comfortable talking to them and even other campers.", "Grades are basically useless... This is kind of a vent and I am not really looking for advice. Maybe some of you can somewhat relate tho. Basically I have a 4.0GPA in highschool which most people wish they had... but for me it is useless. The only reason I have it is because I rarely talk and do all my work in order to be occupied and seem normal I guess? I mean what else am I going to do durring class, stare at a wall? Also I feel the need to get perfect grades because otherwise I feel worthless. I do not do volunteering, have a job, hang out friends (I do not have any), ect. Obviously all those these require verbal communication. I feel useless because I do nothing all day, so getting good grades is the only thing I can feel proud of. Anyways... I keep getting mail from universitys, but I cant even apply since I have nothing else on my resume. Also I am too scared to go because I would need to leave my family who are the only people I talk to. Then I would spend all of my time mute and alone which would suck. Also one of my hobbies is making YouTube videos, but I would need to leave that behind as well.\n\nInstead, I am going to attend my local community college even though I WANT to go to an actual university. It seems so fun for people who make friends, socialize, and go to parties, but I am way too quiet so it is not worth trying at this point. Even if I try to go I would need to sacrifice my hobbies and family, which does not seem worth it for such a small chance. It sucks that us people with SM cannot have a taste of normal life. There is nothing wrong with going to a community college, in fact I would highly recommend it instead of going straight to a university as long as the credits will transfer. It will be cheaper, you can live at home, and you will have more spare time to study or fluff up your resume with volunteer or extra work.\n\nAlso, you should apply anyway to universities even if you do not have as much extra stuff on there as you think you need. It will hurt if they say no, but I have no doubt with your grades that they would say yes and even point you toward scholarships. You miss 100% of the shots you do not take\u2014I would apply to some universities just to see if the option is open. Worst case scenario they say no, second worst case scenario they say yes and you decide to pass.\n\nMany have thriving neurodiversity programs so being mute is not a blocker. See ( for some examples if you are in the US. (Hint: West coast is more liberal in this area.) \n\nThat said I did two years of community college while I figured myself out, then transferred to a university and got my bachelor\u2019s. There are schools, friends, jobs, and careers out there that are very doable as a mute person. You will probably find university easier than high school because the class sizes can be so large and impersonal, it is sometimes more like being in a movie theater than a classroom.\n\nAnd hell, many diversity programs at more modern companies would be chomping at the bit to hire a mute person just for the diversity karma. One thing that I have definitely had to learn this past year, is to never limit myself because of what I \u201cthink\u201d I cannot do, or what I \u201cthink\u201d will happen. Your gpa is honestly enough to get you into a great university. Everyone is not going to have the same experience. And everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Make your time at college be the time that you start to work on the things you think you lack in. It also helps to realize that some people are actually on the opposite side of you, and are working on getting good grades and being more focused, instead of being social all the time. So, everyone has their own path. What matters is the steps that you take within that path to better yourself. You never know what you are capable of until you try. \u2764\ufe0f Omg, you are coping the same way I did! I wanted to have some kind of accomplishment since I had no social skills and felt like a loser, so I put all my time into grades in high school and college. Had an excellent GPA but froze so bad on job interviews. Got better after getting my mom to give me practice interviews and recording my responses on ipad to see what I looked and sounded like.\n\n\nAre there kind, friendly people who try to get you to talk (and do not mind you being quiet)? Becoming friends with these people helps cuz they help coax you out of your shell a bit over time. I met ppl like  this in high school and at a part time job, and I think they are probably the reason I got like 20% better over time. I only spoke like 5% of the time around them, but they seemed to like me for some reason. Hopefully you meet nice people like this too", "Selective Mutism: Short Documentary (Student)  I think you gave people a glimpse into the struggle.

The feelings of loneliness can be incredibly overwhelming. I hope he is doing better since the film was shot. Can you give an update as to how things are going these days? Hi! Thank you for your comment and concern for my brother. He still has not overcome Selective Mutism. He lives on his own now in a family owned home. He is enjoying his own space. Aside from that, he now lives off of disability. I know there have been some problems when it comes to that because he was told that if he cannot speak to them on the phone, then he is not able to handle his own money (or something like that)...Even though not speaking is his disability.\ud83d\ude43 Him and my mom were very frustrated with the woman who said that.\n\nHe is actually pretty content still. He does not talk about his SM that much. I think he is kind of just used to it at this point.  He is thought about college for graphic design but is not sure about that anymore. He honestly is not one to talk about his feelings much, even when asked. He seems happy overall. At this point, I think my family and I are more concerned with him basically being isolated than he is. He has not had friends since he moved  9ish years ago.\n\nI live 18 hours from him now, so we do not keep in touch as much. He is not much into texting. He does not like talking on the phone. He is always been a go with the flow kind of person, so I am glad he is at least not depressed. I wish I could give you more of an update! Unfortunately, there has not been too much change. I am hoping he can get the help he needs some day. \n\nAlso, thank you for your comment of what you wished I had done. It was a very rushed project, and if I ever try to make another video, I will try to delve more into the emotions of that.\ud83d\ude42 I really want to make an actual documentary on it some day and talk to others. Your feedback is much appreciated. When I finally do it, I want to do it justice.\n\nI hope you are well! I hope you do make a proper documentary about the condition and continue bringing awareness to the condition. It is an internal quiet struggle by its very nature which sadly has lots of shame associated with it as well. \n\nSorry to hear that your brother needed to go on disability and that the administrators in charge of his checks are giving him a hard time. I guess they would not be proper state beaurocrats if they did their jobs well. \n\nYou mentioned that he seems content but do you ever wonder that he might want more in his life and has sort of resigned himself from life and given up on his ambitions due to the SM? It sort of reminds me of the cultural Japanese Hikikomori who live similar lifestyles. \n\nAlso has your brother ever found himself in a position in his life where he needed to perform and take action despite his disorder?\nAnd also do you feel like there might come a time where you will become responsible for him as a guardian?\n\nSpeaking for myself after years of solitude when I finally found proper work which was incredibly difficult and took many years it gave me a reason to get up in the morning and I had to act because I knew people were relying on me. I still have a long way to go in terms of progress but having that structure in life turned out to be incredibly important to my well being and went a long way in lessening my sm symptoms. I hope I can some day. I do not have the proper equipment now, but I would like to. It makes me sad that there is so much shame that comes with it. \n\nI do wonder that. My brother is very intelligent and hilarious. I think he would be doing very well I would he was not so content in this lifestyle. He is admitted to being content and actually is not depressed. I know that he would probably like a girlfriend, but part of me think he has kind of given up on what others would consider \"normal.\" He had a great therapist years ago, but she moved. I am hoping he gets back into therapy.\n\nThere has not been a time yet where he is had to take action. I have discussed it with my mom, and I would be the one to help him take care of things. We have an older sister, but my brother and I are only two years apart, so I have always been closer to him. I would be the one to take in the roles my mom does if something were to happen to her. My brother has actually worked at the Columbus Zoo with me in landscape when when lived in Columbus. He is capable of working, but I do think he is just kind of given up on that part. I could be wrong though. I do not want to say anything that is not truthful.\n\nYou found it difficult to get jobs as well?  I am so glad you found that structure in your life. Let me know if I ask a question I should not, I just know it is different for everyone.. Have you been able to talk at all to those you work with? I have heard there are people who talk to their close friends or close co-workers. My brother only talks to 3 people. Did you ever learn anything like sign language? I have thought about suggesting it to my brother so he can commit in some way, but I am not sure if even that causes too much anxiety.\n\nSorry if this is not worded the greatest. I am I am a hurry but wanted to make sure I respond! You sound like there is hope since he is not depressed about his situation. Perhaps necessity to take action will lead to progress and improvement.\n\nIt was hard just getting thru interviews in one peice and they never went well. I suppose I got lucky. In my job I still find myself not talking more than necessary. Anything related to work or tasks is manageable. The most important thing is showing up on time and being productive. I am a great at my job despite my shortcomings. I will have conversations but find myself trying to get the other person to do most of the talking since it is incredibly hard for me to share opinions and things from my own life. I unconsciously keep things superficial when it comes to things about me and am not vulnerable. That is why it is always hard to connect with others and maintaining friendships and relationships is almost impossible as a result. I am not sure if he will ever overcome SM. \ud83d\ude41 I am glad that he is not depressed though.\n\nIt sounds like, even with the struggles, that you are doing better. \ud83d\ude42 You have made some incredible steps!  I do hope that you find meaningful connections. I know that people often why aqua from things they do not understand, and SM is unfortunately something a lot of people do not understand. I know an internet friendship is not the same as having people in person, but I am open for conversation, and  I am sure you can find a great support system online. You will find those right people for you who understand (or at least try). That is fantastic that you have made major leaps as far as a career! I agree not being depressed is a big deal in and of itself. Thank you it means alot. Very kind words. There is still much work to be done and it does require energy try to connect to others. I need to remind myself to not get complacent and get stuck in the comfort of my own company. Yes I am definitely open to conversation as well. Oh my goodness. I did not get notified there was a comment. I do hope that things get easier for you. It can be very emotionally draining to try to connect when you feel removed in some way. It is so easy to get stuck. My messages are always open!

It is a disorder known for being incredibly difficult to treat and there are very few specialists available in the United States. If improperly treated, Selective Mutism can persist into adulthood and leave a person severely disabled for their entire life. \n\nFor the first eight years of Noelle\u2019s life she only spoke with my husband and I, and two of her best girl friends. She would not speak at school. Over many yrs she worked with countless Psychologists and Therapists with little to no progress. The only specialist in this area of expertise I found was a Psychologist in Pennsylvania for $400 an hour who was treating through video chat. This would have bankrupted us! I realized as Noelle was approaching 10 yrs old that we were entering \u201cthe point of no return\u201d and this would become a permanent lifelong issue if not resolved quickly. Time was of the essence! It was at this point I decided to take matters into my own hands. I fired the Therapist who had been working were her at our home and read a half dozen books on Selective Mutism to gain more knowledge of the condition and write up a treatment plan. I felt empowered during this time and hopeful that my treatment plan would be successful. \n\nThe Summer of 2004 I worked with Noelle daily and viligiantly. All of her small steps up the social phobia ladder all added up to big leaps forward. By the end of the Summer she was calling up family members and grandparents who had never heard her voice before and conversing with them for the first time. She was now able to speak normally outside of the school setting. She however still refused to speak at school. I knew children need to be treated at both home and school separately and that this would be the biggest hurdle to overcome because she had never had a teacher that was willing to invest in helping her overcome Selective Mutism. I desperately needed the cooperation of a willing teacher. \n\nWhen Noelle started 4th grade with Ms. Henry It was obvious that we had finally met the teacher that would be able to help Noelle overcome this great obstacle. Shannon immediately took an interest in Noelle and her disability and made it her number one goal that year to get Noelle speaking in class. I provided a book about Selective Mutism the first day I met Shannon and she immediately read it and studied Selective Mutism on her own time.  Shannon and I worked together to write out a classroom treatment plan for Noelle in taking steps towards being able to talk in class. She allowed me to take videos of Noelle speaking to the class from home and show them to the students. Shannon also worked with Noelle after school with several other students throughout the year in helping her to be able to talk to them. She also came to my home on various occasions to work with Noelle. Great gains were made early on. Gradually Noelle improved over the course of the year and she eventually was able to talk inside and outside of the classroom. By the end of the year a miracle occurred and Noelle was able to give a speech in front of her class. \n\nNoelle is almost 14 years old now! She is a social butterfly and is constantly getting in trouble for socializing too much in class. She was recently voted \u201cmost popular\u201d at her school! I am sharing this story because parents need to realize the great power and ability they have to heal their children.

Want To chat about it?\n\n&lt;3", "Questions from someone questioning Hi, I have looked on and off this sub for probably a year, as I suddenly would have trouble talking. Im 17 and would say I acknowledged this happening at about 15. A lot of information seems to clash about this though. Recently it is come back where sometimes I will try to but physically cannot talk. I will at most be able to whisper incoherently or little words slowly. If I think about it and work myself up over it more it will get worse and take longer to try to talk again. \nIt is quite random though, I am usually fairly anxious or worried about something when it happens. It is very sudden and can last 10 minutes or last for hours. I think the worst it got was not being able to talk or barely make a noise for 2 hours. \nIt does not happen in specific places, but it usually happens with specific people. I have an ex who would yell quickly and I would get really freaked out and physically not be able to talk for a while, but usually would get a lot better when we would separate. \nFor this reason I have been learning sign language and am fairly good at finger spelling and simple random words, but sometimes I am not able to do it very quickly as I usually would when I cannot speak. \nSo, I guess my questions would be: is it physical? Does it have to happen in certain situations or places? Would I benefit from maybe talking to someone else about this? (Though I do not know who, like doctor?) and would this be selective mutism? Selective mutism requires a professional diagnosis, so any replies you get (including mine) is just a guess. But it definitely sounds like selective mutism and you should absolutely ask a doctor about it.\n\nIf it is SM, it is an anxiety disorder and is technically psychiatric, but it can be very physical too. Essentially it has to do with your subconscious reacting on instinct to physically prevent speech. Since you mentioned an abusive ex, I am going to hazard a guess you are dealing with a trauma response. Trauma responses fall into four different categories: fight, flight, freeze, and fawn. Selective mutism is usually a freeze response, take no action to avoid drawing attention from a threat. The thing about trauma responses is that they are handled by the same part of your brain that controls physical stuff. Heartbeat, breathing, digestion, etc. So even though the root cause is psychological, the end result is very much a physical thing. Ah okay, thank you! I will definitely talk to my doctor about it when I see them next.", "What could help me speak? ", "Join the official subreddit Selective Mutism Discord server!

I remember always trying to get out of oral presentations, sometimes faking strep throat or saying I did not do the project at all and taking the F. Even in my high school years when I could identify my problem as anxiety, teachers did not sympathize at all and basically just told me to get over it. If you were called on and did not say anything or went \"Uhhh...\" sometimes they would mock you, which made it worse and made me more anxious. \n\nI was friendless and bullied for most of those years. A few years ago, my dad said it really hurt him to drop me off at school and see me walk into the building because my body language was completely deflated and defeated every day. \n\nWhen I finished my \"ugly duckling\" phase and entered high school, people wanted to be my friend. I was told all the time \"I thought you were weird/a bitch/rude/conceited because you never spoke.\" Because I never really had friends and especially not close friends, I was desperate to fit in and hang onto them. I pretty much did whatever they said and did. A lot of drugs and drinking, which actually made me a lot less mute and anxious. But because it helped, I stopped going to school sober, then stopped going entirely. \n\nMy dad sent me to a new school pretty far away, so I did not know a soul.

I work at a preschool, and one of the four year olds suffers from what i presume is selective mutism - she will talk at home and other places, but the moment she walks in the doors of the school she will not say another word until she is back in the car on the way home. While in school, however, she seems to enjoy herself and plays with other kids (for the most part), but will not talk to anyone at all. \n\nHow did having selective mutism affect your school experiences? Did it make you resent school? Did you still enjoy school?   Hi! I personally found SM affected me more as i got older, as a young child it was never that hard to just pick up a toy and makes friends.\nOne of the biggest negatives I remember was the assumption from most teachers that I was stupid or did not understand the school work, eg. being put in lower classes despite my grades or punished for \u2018too good\u2019 work.\nSM children might have a couple of friends they rely on to talk for them and although separating them occasionallly in a controlled way may be beneficial, permanent separation can increase the anxiety.\nYou did not mention but if you have not already talk to the parents about finding help or see what the schools SEN services might have to offer, early intervention = more success. I did not talk in school growing up. It was difficult to make friends, and the friends I did make were not close. I did my work though and so the teachers just did not bother with me. When I got to middle school the teachers did not know my name. I wanted to stay out of the spotlight so this was fine, but sometimes when I saw everyone laughing and having conversation I felt really lonely. I wanted a teacher or someone to try with me. I knew it would be difficult for both of us, and because of that difficultly they would not try to talk to me again. \n\nI hated school. I would always play sick to stay home and put up a fight with my mom. Elementary and middle were probably the worst for me. No close friends, teachers that would get onto me for not understanding the lesson and not asking questions. It just straight up sucked. \n\nWhen I got to high school, I was able to make friends that were a little closer, but still was not able to talk to anyone else. By 10th grade I gave up, i got so depressed I did not care anymore and my grades dropped. I quit all the activities I was doing, which was just soccer and robotics,  and stopped talking to friends. I tried to drop out. I ended up having to finish 10th grade home schooled even more alone than before. \n\nOne person can make a big difference with kids. If I had that one person at a younger age, my life would be completely different. Luckily I got that person last year, and I am doing great now. \n\nIt is not that someone with Selective mutism does not want to talk, it is that they have an extreme anxiety for some reason. I would give anything for someone to have worked with me. I wanted to talk so bad. \n\nSmall interactions mean a lot and i am sure they would go far. \n\nSorry this is so long, but as another comment said, early intervention = more success.  Thank you so much!! I will be sure to ask my boss if they have talked with the parents about it and if they are doing any interventions!  Thank you for your answer! I do have a question, though. What would you have wanted that \u2018one person\u2019 to do? I am glad you found yours! I hope that as time goes on, the child will get the intervention and help she needs in order to make more progress, no matter how small. I plan as asking my boss if any intervention has been put in place and if the parents are getting the child the support she needs.  Well, everyone is different. For me I was basically just ignored because I did not talk. Just do not ignore her. Make contact like you would with other students. I loved and still love learning, but I hated school. Other kids would pick on me and exclude me in elementary school and beyond. In middle school the few friends I had before were too cool to hang out with me. High school was a nightmare. To avoid the details, I will just say the way I was treated while there was inhumane and certainly left lasting trauma.;Luckily, my parents got me into treatment for my SM partway through high school and I said adios to that school system for good.\n\nBut I think it is important that people with SM have access to treatment early on to avoid feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and even self-hatred later on. Avoiding speaking is a maladaptive coping mechanism for social anxiety, so it will only make anxiety worse in the long-run. As a teacher, I would encourage her to stay social even if she is not speaking because avoidance will just worsen anxiety and make her more avoidant. I had both teachers and peers tease me and try to goad me into speaking as a child and I think that was another thing that made the anxiety worse.\n\nOn a side note, does she show any signs of ASD? I was not diagnosed with Asperger's until I was in middle school, likely because I had a more female autism presentation and others would consider me \"just shy\". There is limited research, but SM and ASD seem to have some overlap, so it might be a good idea to just keep an eye out for any autistic traits.  list]( of some possible traits autistic girls may have if you want to take a look. I was diagnosed with selective mutism after starting first grade at a new school where I did not know anyone. I was always quiet and reserved but up until this point had not been in many situations where I was outside of my comfort zone with people I did not know. I was very quiet at my new school but did not have problems making friends. I believe I would have struggled with social anxiety no matter what but I thoroughly believe my first grade teacher is the reason I developed selective mutism. She was mean, yelled, and frequently threw things around the classroom. Adults in my life were not like this growing up and I was a kid who always followed the rules and rarely got in trouble for actively defying them. My teacher picked on everyone but she specifically zoned in on me because I was terrified to speak to her. She would bully me in front of the entire class because I would not speak to her. The worst day of my life was when my teacher put me in the center of the carpet and made my friends and classmates chant \u201cspeak\u201d at me. I never told another adult until years later, I did not think this was wrong at the time. I did anything to avoid class after that. At the end of recess I would fall on the playground and skin my knee on purpose so I could go to the nurse and miss class, I went to the nurse practically every day with a belly ache just to get away, I would sit in the bathroom until another student was sent to get me. The worst part was when the school psychologist became aware of some of the issues I was having she included this teacher in my plan of care. By the end of that year I had begun seeing an outside psychiatrist and a play therapist who properly diagnosed me and by 2nd grade I began treatment. My parents did not find anything out until I was much older and still to this day I have repressed most of her abuse. I resent that teacher and every teacher who is in the field for a power trip and control. I am glad as a teacher you are genuinely interested and care about they experience of your students. \n\nIn the following years after I received treatment I began to love school again and all of my avoidance behaviors stopped. During that first grade year my classmates and friends were what got me through. Everyone knew our teacher was awful and a lot of my friends would actually help me communicate. I remember whispering into my friends ears to talk with my teacher because I was so petrified of her. At that age I feel like a lot of kids do not judge and are able to play and communicate without necessarily speaking to each other. It did not become difficult for me to interact with peers until middle and high school.  That is a good point it is easy for teachers and other students to ignore kids with SM because we subconsciously or consciously want to be invisible to avoid any possible pain from social interaction or embarrassment. For me I would have never gotten help if a teachers aid in my first grade class did not report issues I was having to the school psychologist at such a young age. I was also very lucky to live so close and have parents who were able to locate one of the leading psychiatrists in SM at the time.  Still in school, and honestly, selective mutism is making me hate it.\n\nI suddenly developed some pretty bad anxiety and SM during middle school, and by high school, I only spoke to a couple teachers and that was all. Friends were very minuscule - once we had no classes together, that was the end of it - but I did not entirely mind. School was just a place where I wanted to get in and get out. I can actually hold some decent conversations with teachers after class, since I am not as nervous around adults.\n\nBullying was and still is a problem for me. Since I was unable to report a lot of it, I was usually excluded from crowds and picked on because I could not tell them to leave. Some people have not heard a word out of my mouth in four years. Teachers as well; some not-so-keen teachers thought my silence meant that I disliked them. A majority appreciate how I am quiet and willing to work, though. When I need to communicate and speech is not an answer, I have been provided the options of either writing notes to them or emailing them.\n\nOverall, it is not great. But I am glad some teachers are understanding of it.", "Do I have selective mutism? When I get stressed or randomly, ill try to speak but nothing comes out or I feel majorly uncomfortable speaking. I struggle to communicate during these sessions. I have had some at school unable to get words out to speak to them. Its not known by others because no one really sees it. Hello, you appear to have asked a question about whether you have selective mutism. \n\nWe can help you understand selective mutism with ( Please remember that our members can only give you an opinion on whether you meet the criteria for selective mutism, not a diagnosis. If you would like to be properly assessed, it is highly recommended to see a medical professional. ( section of the wiki.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/selectivemutism) if you have any questions or concerns.* This Just happened to me today... again. Yes. I do not think so because you can speak normally but you only cannot speak when you are stressed As someone who has had SM for a long time it definitely sounds like it could be. Selective mutism is when you physically cannot speak in certain situations due to be uncomfortable, stressed or under a lot of anxiety. You can also suddenly go mute without any reason, it is less common but it is definitely happened to me every now and then. Yes. This is what happens to me. I cry in frustration when I cannot speak too. That is kind of what selective mutism is. The symptoms you have described here are not consistent with SM. No, it is not. Are you are neuropsychologist or an SLP? I am not sure really so I asked. I mean this gently-have you considered hypochondria?  Your posts are riddled with ideas that you have one diagnosis or another. You seem preoccupied with having various diagnoses. I have adhd and low blood pressure, I have been diagnosed. \n\nAustism is coming through so do not know yet but people around me all agree autism.\n\nI never know what I have, and just bounce around what I feel fits. \u201cWhat is selective mutism?\nSelective mutism is when a child cannot speak in certain settings, but can speak fine in others. For example, a child may not be able to speak at school, but can speak with no problem at home. It is called selective mutism because the child is only mute in select situations. It is a rare childhood condition. It can cause problems with school and social situations.\n\nA child with selective mutism may find certain social situations very stressful. This may cause anxiety so severe that the child feels unable to speak. Selective mutism is not caused by a child\u2019s willful refusal to speak.\n\nIn some cases, a child may have other speech problems as well. But in many cases, a child may not have any trouble at all when he or she feels comfortable.\u201d\n\nFrom: \n\nAlso many other websites indicate that they can be very stressed and it makes them unable to speak. I have selective mutism. Selective mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder in which a person normally cannot speak in specific situations, specific places, or to specific people if triggered. Selective mutism usually co-exists with social anxiety disorder.\n\nMore details here: &lt; \n\n\n\n*This comment was left automatically (by a bot).

The thing is i am scared that being isolated from people my age is going to have a horrible effect on me. I am a highschool freshman who has not had friends for years and I still do not. I do not think that being in regular school would have changed much. I went to the largest school in my state and everyone stayed away from me. \n\nI cannot even talk to people online either. I have people that try to talk to me online but I cannot ever keep up a conversation. I never know what to say i am just not very interesting. \n\nFor years i have coped with my loneliness by being obsessed with tv show characters and celebrities. Right now my obsession is Umbrella Academy. Sometimes I get to thinking about how i will never live a somewhat normal life like these characters. I will never have a boyfriend or girlfriend (hell i do not even know what i like because i am never around enough people.) I probably will never get a job, go to collage, or any friends. \n\nI do not have any productive interests so I could not make friends from any hobbies. All of my interests are stuff like listening to music, watching tv, and that is about it. I know you said you cannot talk to people online but if you want, message me and give it a shot, I am going through the exact same right now and I would love someone to talk to PM me if you want to Not sure if you already considered it but this subreddit does have a Discord chat  so people like you can talk to each other there  I am very isolated as well. I have recovered from SM, but I do not have a job or school right now and cannot drive, so I spend a lot of time alone in my room. I understand what you are saying about TV shows replacing real human relationships because I am the same way. It can be crushingly lonely.\n\nThis idea that you have no future because of SM was my thought process as a teenager as well. I felt like my life was over before it began. But the truth is you have more control over your life than you think. You cannot just choose to make an anxiety disorder go away, but you can make small choices that help you get to a point where you are less anxious and isolated.\n\nTry a new med, knowing there is a chance things can get worse. Switch therapists, knowing that the new one might be worse. Tag along when your parents go shopping if just being out in public is a source of anxiety. These are the kinds of things I am doing right now. I know taking these small steps in the right direction will pay off in the long-term. It can be frustrating when things do not change overnight, but I try to embrace the failure and missteps and keep moving forward. It is all I can do.\n\nAlso, the SM Discord chat has been going really well so far, we have a very friendly little group. You would not be alone in feeling anxious about talking to others online. It is OK if you are not comfortable right now, but if you ever change your mind, feel free to pop in. You can even silently watch us chat if that is more comfortable. :) Sounds like me. Online is awkward and does not really work, especially when you have got nothing that sparks any sort of joy in you anymore. It is not like online can be different when you do not know how to communicate in general... but everyone else keeps thinking these things that do not exist will just happen.

I\u2019be been on antidepressants for over several years, which I hate taking. \n\nI am 22 now.  I guess I could say I overcame it. I do not go mute anymore.  I like to consider it social anxiety, or even selective shyness, and I cannot talk to one parents side of the family. I recently got a job that requires talking to people, and sometimes I start standing there getting frozen and intimidated and start wishing to end my life. \n\nThe last psychologist I saw did not even know how to cure sm or social anxiety and suggested maybe seeing an sm specialist. Which I have seen when I was younger except for only one session lol.  \n\nCould they help cure what remnants I have left of sm?   Someone noticed it at work - I am sick of being the girl that obly talks to one person and no one else.

I would love to be able to talk the way I text\n\nI want to be an outspoken woman with a strong personality like I am in my head on the outside 24/7, I want to destroy my shell and my inner feisty/sassyness to come out.     \n\nHas anyone seen a specialist and being cured?

I get that feeling too. I think with phobias, you have to find a compromise with your own head. \n\nWhat will make you feel safe? There is a phone app called Noonlight that you tap to instantly and silently call the police. Do you need to improve your home security? Get an airhorn or something that sounds like people or a dog? Actually get a large, protective dog? Put timers on your lights to make the house look more occupied? \n\nDo these things, and then work on your anxiety. Remind yourself that you have done what you can do, and the rest of your worry is not reasonable. Work with a therapist, and see if you need medication to address fear or racing thoughts that are still interfering with your ability to live, work, or sleep. \n\nKnow that addressing your fears WILL make an improvement. You are not a victim of your fear, and you can do something about it. Thank you for replying! And I have got something similar on my phone, it is a built in thing on my phone where if you press the on/off button 5 times and then press something it sends your location to the emergency services, and I have got a dog and security alarm and none of it seems to help. I also leave a light on somewhere that is visible from outside at all times when I am on my own. I think part of the problem aswell as the actual fear of it/anxiety is that I have not been on my own that much, I am only 17 so do not live alone, and there is someone home most of the time, so hopefully when I start getting more used to it it will get better You are at an age where you are old enough to be taking adult responsibility but young enough that you do not have a whole lot of power or life experience, so things seem very large and intimidating. It will not be this way forever. Your fears are very common for someone your age and position. I do not mean to belittle them, only to say that you are far from the first 17 year old to feel afraid in a house alone. It is normal, and it will get better.\n\nI strongly encourage you to talk to someone about managing your fears and anxiety, be it a trusted friend or family member, or a therapist. You will be afraid of things your whole life, so it is important to learn how to manage those feelings and not let them get the best of you. I can see that you are clever and you have taken a lot of steps in the right direct. That is a good job! Try to appreciate your accomplishments so you can have faith that you really can take care of yourself. \n\nWould it help to talk to your parents when they leave you alone and tell them you are nervous about criminals? Maybe they could text you if they are going to be late, or you could text them when you are going to bed, or some other important moment when you would like to check in? I think the more you are alone, the more used to it you get.  You have a dog and an alarm!  Tell yourself over and over that YOU ARE SAFE, because you are.  Your dog and security system are an unstoppable force!\n\nI have ptsd, and sometimes if I am stressed, I get hypervigilant.  I am not diagnosed with ocd, but certainly have tendencies.  I can drive myself freakin crazy sometimes.  I developed a routine that when stressed, I allow myself one complete and thorough check.  With full mindfulness, I check windows and doors, and when that anxiety comes back full force, I just tell it, I AM SAFE.  I checked everything, and I am good.\n\nAnd you know, my house has been broken into twice.  Once was overnight, and they were very quiet, and we did not know about it until we got up the next morning and the door was open.  We were not scared, because it was already done.  The other time, I confronted a guy halfway through my dining room window.  I immediately went to angry mom mode and said, \"No!  This is not okay!  You need to leave right now!\"  He nodded his head, touched his hand to his heart like \"my bad\" and ran off.  \n\nYeah, it was scary, but at the same time, I lived through it, and I was ok.  I do not fear it as much as I used to,  Kind of like living through a tornado.

I think she is abusive. \n\nI sometimes question if she was really abusive  of if I was oppositional or if I was just taking things more sensitive than a normal kid", "so im wondering if i have sm.. i am not asking for a professional diagnosis, i just want someone to tell me if it seems like i have selective mutism based on my experiences. i have always had social anxiety, but im not sure if the sm came first or the anxiety. but anyway, i have been practically mute outside the house since i was around 4-5. idk the exact causes, but im guessing my older sister influenced me, because she also had some form of selective mutism. i always copied after her so i guess i learned that trait from her too. i could talk perfectly fine at home but when it came to school, i could not bring myself to say a word. this led me to being socially isolated throughout childhood. no one could hear me whenever i talked either, so i thought there was no point in opening my mouth to speak.\n\nat school, whenever im put into a group with ppl im not comfortable with (mostly everyone), i completely shut down and retreat into my own space. everyone just talks around me and i physically cannot bring myself to jump into their conversation. it makes me feel so trapped and uncomfortable. i literally just doodle in my notebook in order to distract myself from the discomfort. if im in a table with my small pool of friends, i can speak freely, but once they bring in another person that i dont know, i immediately shut down and stop talking. this has been a problem for the past 10 years and i cannot seem to get over it. i cant even talk to people my age, so god forbid i try to make conversation with kids or older adults. my voice is also really low, so i cant use that fake cutesy voice u use with kids and pets, which im insecure about. im actually insecure about everything related to my social life/skills.\n\nso do i have selective mutism or not? im genuinely convinced that i do. i talked to my psychologist about it and she was adamant in telling me that i was not selectively mute. she probably only thought that since i was able to talk to her freely, but no shit, ur my psychologist so i feel the need to talk to you. plus it is a 1-on-1 convo so it is easier my completely unprofessional opinion is that you absolutely do have selective mutism. You should seek out a second opinion. \n\nWhen I first found out about sm, it was in 9th grade, reading an article online that made it sound like sm was something young kids had which made it so that they could not say a single word to anyone outside of their family. This had never been the case with me. Then in 10th grade I was diagnosed. Completely shocked me. I was only expecting to receive a social anxiety diagnosis. \n\nI had never been fully mute, just very good at giving very brief answers to questions.\n\n \"What is your favourite colour?\" \"Red\" \n\"How are you?\" \"Good\" \nWhat did you do this weekend\" \"I went to the movies\"\n\nLike the shortest possible reply, always monotone, no real expression, unfortunately nothing to make the convo easier on the other person (like offering up the name of the movie I saw on the weekend, or how I felt about it. those answers required additional questions).   just shy smiles and not much else \n\nBasically sm looks different for everyone, especially if you are not a kid anymore. Not every psychologist is educated in sm. \n\nI also find one-on-one easiest too and I also really push myself to talk to professionals like you do. Doesnt mean you do not have sm:) good luck with everything. I have not fully recovered but I can promise at least that progress is possible:) I feel like you do have SM. A lot of those traits you have described sounds exactly like when I had SM and even what a lot struggle with after. You should definitely get a second opinion or an official diagnosis! I think that your psychologist needs to understand those with SM talk with the people they are comfortable with. My sister struggled with SM throughout middle school and she still talked to her therapist like a friend. SM can differ from person to person. :)", "Should I try? Tomorrow a school nurse will be available. She is not like the band-aid ice pack kind of nurse, she deals with stuff like mental health and stuff. I have been wanting to go ser her for a while, but the only time I tried she was not even there and another teacher asked me about it, but I just ran away. \nI really want to get help, but I am scared to and I do not know if she will even be able to help. And if I tell her about it, I will probably have to tell her other stuff, and she might have to tell my parents. The only reason I want to go to her instead of a professional outside of school is because I am scared my parents will hear stuff, and they told me last year that they would book me into some sort of therapy in January/February. I never got booked in, just told I would be. \nI do not even know what she would do about it. I have never been to anyone to help with it, so I do not know what she will ask or do or anything. \nAnyone have any advice on whether I should go or not? You should definetly try to go to her if you want to seek help. Maybe she can support you and give you advice. Also i dont think nurses are allowed to tell people stuff about their patients without their consent so try not to worry abou that :) whatever you do, i wish you the best! Teying will not hurt you. And depending on your age, you can ask the therapist to not knvolve your parents. Taking the first step is the hardest, but it will get easier with time. You got this! Please dont be against going to therapy! It sounds like you dont want to go to one based on how you said you dont want your parents to hear because they will send you to therapy. I guess it can kind of sound bad when its coming off as a threat from them, but therapy is so beneficial. \n\nThey cant tell your parents anything unless you give the okay, they legally cannot say anything without your consent. Unless youre actively going to hurt yourself or others, and even then, its not your parents getting called. \n\nYou dont have to actually talk (with your voice) to your therapist. They are more than open to communicating through another media, such as maybe you can type things. Ive also seen a lot of therapists who just let you chill until you feel comfortable. Or, theres even specialized board games used to aid in communication! No therapist will judge you for being SM, they just want to help. \n\nOf course, right now things are a bit different because of the coronavirus, so a lot of therapists are doing video calls. Though Im curious about whether the ones near you will be closed because your school is still open? Even if they are closed, Im sure your therapist wouldnt be opposed to you typing your responses during a video call, instead of talking. \n\nTherapy has literally changed my life. Ive been going to various ones for 5 years and if were being honest, I dont even know where I would be if I hadnt gone. \n\nStart by going to your nurse, definitely. She will probably just ask general questions like hows your family, are there any major stressers in your life, do you feel like youre going to hurt yourself / others (this is generally a required question, she does not actually think youre at risk); really basic things. Nobody will be called or told anything unless she thinks youre not in a safe environment or at risk of hurting yourself or others. It does not hurt to go, but I think a professional would be more confidential?", "Adult with Selective Mutism I am 20 years old and I still struggle with talking, my mom often talks for me.

At this point i feel like this just isnt going to ever change for me. I had a job a while back that killed me mentally. 12 hours a day 5 days a week night shift. On top of this my hormones were not producing even a fraction of what they should of so my life was a complete disaster. My childhood dog died and I started to bald. I could not take life anymore and became extremely suicidal to a point I did not think someone could reach. I have been recovering but my mental health from the hormones, job, balding, and death experience tortured me so bad I could not care about anything anymore. My selective mutism is now eradicated. I know it sounds corny but you just have to stop caring. This disease is ruining you and for no reason. It is ruthless and no one understands the gravity of it. Tell yourself everyday that you will not give two fucks about how you talk and if you stutter, get asked to repeat yourself or go blank, do not let it eat you. Live your life man, fuck SM I am 29, and never thought I could get better, but have been improving over the last few years and can now do some things I never thought were possible for me.\n\nI saw a therapist when I was 23, but they did not help me - they did not understand SM, and I was always worried they would force me to talk. I knew I was not \u201cready.\u201d I always expected them to tell me \u201cYou are wasting my time if you do not talk.\u201d I know now that they were not the right therapist for me. I have read self help books, and they probably help more for some people. The Selective Mutism Resource Manual has been a helpful book for me, as were books about cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety and low self esteem.\n\nA big problem for me was the fear of my family potentially making a big deal out of it or being proud of me for something I felt I should have been doing all my life. Once I was able to let my mum know how I felt about this and she reassured me, I was ready to start improving, and have been getting better ever since, although I talk very quietly or too fast (sometimes both).\n\nI think it is very important that you are ready, otherwise it might not work as well as you hoped. For example, if you have any reasons for holding yourself back, you need to deal with them first and try to change your mindset about whatever it is. It is also probably better to start with very small steps. They might seem small, but they are big, and each one adds up. \n\nI started with talking at home while one of my parents were on the phone in a different room (something I could never do) followed by talking in the backyard and then in the car in possible earshot of strangers when we were getting petrol. I have not spoken much in person yet (mostly because I have not left the house much in the last year) but have so far been able to get an eye test, thank someone who served me in a shop, and do voice chats on Discord. My mind has changed, but I am not able to show this when I am not leaving the house much.\n\nVoice recordings are a good way to desensitise yourself, and you can have fun talking in a weird voice to start with until you are comfortable using your own voice. I still have trouble with those because I am \u201ctalking to myself\u201d as I record them, but still do them anyway. Voice chats are easier for me, surprisingly. This could be because the person I talk to is understanding and has a calming voice.  I am 18 and feel the same way, a relationship is why I want to get the fuck out of it. Otherwise I feel as if the future is bleak. One day they will be gone and I will have no one.\n\nSo I am trying now, and being a little more open with my Mom as to truly why I do not. I wish they would push me more and more because that is what I need. The social worker does not help...the speech therapy, kind of. Although I can speak more than normally as a SM who played Xbox with their friends for YEARS talking openly and loudly.\n\nTo me it is the reaction of suddenly me talking I am scared of. I am weird in the sense. Also I feel the SAME way, it is the REACTION of suddenly 'I am speaking'....if it was not for that, I would be speaking in my eyes. \n\nPersonally I do not have a problem with people I do not know, they do not know me. I can talk to them. I can talk over Xbox and to my friends in person, although I do not start convos.\n\nThe reason at 18, I actually want to change is because I want to start dating or something like that. I feel like that is the purpose of life ATM.\n\nI am hoping to be talking by the end of July 2021, although that most likely will not happen. Though as time goes on and I cry each day, I tell my Mom more and more about what it all actually is. This has all been adding up since 6th grade.\n\nI still need to tell her more. It is like the truth will set me free, but at the same time expose shit, I am not comfortable exposing like that I can actually want to actively pursue a girl I met 2 weeks ago with my family. And that that is what sent me into this depressive state for the last 2 weeks. It made me realize I need to change. And why I am actually going onto these Mute subs for once, instead of avoiding those like me out of spite I guess.\n\nI sing in the car to myself, but would never tell my Dad I listen to Rap/Ariana Grande....although in my mind, I would love to be open. I do not like to lie by my nature, but I find myself throughout my life with holding my true self. \n\nIt is come to the point where I want to just write my Mom/Dad a paper on what it all actually is, of course that would expose my true self, but maybe that is what I need to do. Hi OP! I am 21 and you are not alone", "I cannot talk to my psychiatrist I have had selective mutism since I was very young , however , it got worse this year (all my conditions suddenly worsened this year) . \n\nI visit a psychiatrist regularly , however , I find it hard to talk to him , I always end up with meltdowns because I get so nervous . I have a lot to talk about , but I just cannot because of SM . \n\nI cannot also write what I want to say too , my writing style in my native language is very bizarre , I cannot write such stuff in my 2nd language , and everything I want to say is in English which is our 3rd language . My psychiatrist will not be able to comprehend everything .\n\n\nWhat should I do ? Write it out in your native language, and then translate what you can? Translating something already written might be easier than trying to write it down from your head in English. What you wrote here seems perfectly comprehensible so I think you will be fine. Type it out on a computer and print it, or type it out on a note app on your phone and show it to your therapist.\n\nThere are ways to deal with mute patients. I am reading a book right now called \"The Body Keeps The Score\" in which the therapist explains how he or his colleagues have dealt with such cases before. They are more common than you would think.\n\nWhat has to be done? You have to connect with your therapist in a way that you will start feeling safe with them, safe enough that you will be able to talk, even a few sentences at a time. A good therapist will come up with a personalized approach for you, but keep in mind your typical therapist might not have the training to do so. The average therapist is not a psychologist or psychiatrist. I would say you would need to find a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist, they would be knowledgeable enough to come up with a plan designed specifically for your use case.\n\nEdit: just saw after reading your post again that you are seeing a qualified psychiatrist. If they are good they should know what to do. If they do not know how to approach this, stop wasting your time and find a different therapist. Same. I cannot say anything.", "How to talk to others in xbox parties? I like to play online with one of my friends, and it is gotten a bit easier verbally speaking to him in parties but when he invites other people i go completely mute and a barely speak at all. Because of this it is hard to make friends with others. I get really really anxious and grumpy and it caused me to leave the parties sometimes.", "What do I say? Okay so it happened again today when I got to school, I decided to tell my friend I may have SM (Selective mutism) she said like \u201cAw\u201d and gave me a side hug - she asked one or two questions and I typed them in for her on the phone since I was not talking , and she said to not say anymore or she would cry? Idk (I do not know) if she was serious or not , but then I was late to computer class because I mixed the days up and she kind of started treating me like I was handicap.?\n\nShe started emailing me asking if I needed help, I am not fully sure what she meant because there is not much you can do, but it feels like I am being pampered which I do not want I still want to be treated like a normal person. I think people tend to do that because they do not realize the complexity of any such diagnosis. My friends know I am not one to talk, but I never ever told them I have SM, and I do not plan on it. I do not tell anyone, besides my parents, they did tell people and still do(which when they did/do I would proceeded to be treated as the above, and I cut off that person from talk-ability).\n\nThe less people who know, the better. SM affects some situations/people, for her I would assume it is not a real issue (as much as it normally can be). It is more complex, SM is really only an anxiety based thing with social communication, it is not cognitive. &gt;I am not fully sure what she meant because there is not much you can do, but it feels like I am being pampered which I do not want I still want to be treated like a normal person.\n\nTell her this. That you do not really want or need 'help', that it is just a way that you are different and you told her so she could better understand who you really are Thank you, I will tell her tomorrow if I am able to if not I will just text it to her. People who love us often want to help, but do not know the right way to help. Now I know what happens when people find out about this... I guess I made the right choice not telling anyone. Do not want ppl to label me like that", "Is this selective mutism? Sometimes I will just be sitting there for a long period of time and my S/O will be talking to me. I hear him, and I think the response in my head, but it does not come out. It does not feel like a choice, it just feels like I am limited to speaking in my head at those moments. He gets really frustrated and thinks I am ignoring him but I am not, the words just do not come out. Not being able to talk in certain situation, even though you want to, defines selective mutism. How is your behaviour without him around? Can you communicate verbally?\n\nFor example, my SM was enormous difficulty in talking with strangers, when i warm up with them, i was able to talk quite normally. While I used to be quite loud with my family, as soon as we had guests, the energy would disappear. Took many years of therapy to get over it.\n\nI do not know much about your situation, couls be SM, couls be something else. You would need to descrobe your normal behaviour / behaviour with different people around.\n\nThe selective means that it is in certain situations, where you cannot speal due to high anxiety, even though ylu want to.\n\nIf he feels ignored, try to communicate somehow, even if its with text, and tell him how you feel/what you are experiencing. When he talks to you, to affirm that you are listening, like with regular nodding! Like u/ChrownZDoom said, it is defined around wanting to speak, but not being able to. It is very often about specific people, some select people you can talk to just fine, some select people you can not. My experience however is a bit deviating. For me it is not about people, it is about my state of mind. I go non verbal if I get triggered, because I have trauma, so there are subject matters that I cannot express verbally even though I can write about them all I want, I go non verbal if I am accused of something no matter if I did it or not. Pay attention, if it is connected to certain people, to subject matter, are you anxious, sad, mad, neutral? Read about shyness, introversion, selective mutism, and social anxiety, figure out the differences and see which one fits you the best because they are all very different yet people mistake them to be the same sometimes. I have not been diagnosed, so there is no certainty in that regard if even mine is sm and there is no way to tell that about another person for me, I am not trained and I do not know your situation. For that evaluation, therapy is always an option, even completely healthy people go into therapy the occasional time just to prevent mental illness and to catch things early. Like that biyearly doctor's check up just to check on general health we are supposed to have. I do this too. For me personally, I think of it as a lingering effect of my SM...I spent so many of my younger years not being able to speak, so now it does not always occur to me to speak my mind. I am on the spectrum, and this is how my SM manifests, too. It feels almost like I have reached a word count for the day. I simply cannot speak any more. I have thoughts on what I would say, but nothing comes out. I have learned to identify what signals a possible episode and I tell him, \"I am about out of words for the day.\" And then he either leaves me alone or he just talks and understands that I cannot respond. It is a weird feeling, but I understand you! ", "Cured my selective mutism at 18 Welp i cured my selective mutism at 18.\nThis post is going to be brief. This condition has caused me so much pain and torment. I have been social isolated and ignored to the point where i wish i was never born. People always had high hopes for me first meeting me then as soon as I spoke\u2026they ostracized me they completely looked at me in a different disappointed way all together. \nI cured this by wim hoff breathing and self speech therapy and meditation.  in the past when I am speaking and people do not look at me i always figured they are ignoring me but it was I was not speaking in an audible frequency. I would mumble in a super low almost apelike tone. Now it all went away after breathing wim hoff.

I have a cycle that happens whenever I join a new discord server, first I join it, then I start forming bonds with the people there, lastly I either get banned, kicked, stop being active on it or the server dies, It happened three times so far, one was because I compared someone to CWC and an abusive admin banned me, another one was because I was not active and just decided to leave it and the reason why I am making this, I was kicked from this subreddit\u2019s discord server, I can join it again whenever I what otherwise I would have been banned, not kicked but then the members of it would probably treat me differently then they did before, honestly I was putting off making this post for a while now, the only reason I decided to do it is because my subconscious was saying I would feel better after putting my feelings out there.", "Why do teachers do this! At my school we have this Hong called a wheel class, it is basically where every 6 weeks we get a new teacher. \n\nSo anyways i got a new teacher, and the counselor forgot to give the forms about my sm to my new teacher. So she called on my twice, read my assignment out loud, and told me that I was overly descriptive. Then she called on me, and I could not answer, so someone at my table told her teacher what the answer was that I would told them earlier. And she just told me that \u201cis it really that hard to answer my question? \n\nThe next day she pulls me out of class, and tells me she got the forms about my sm, and that because of my needs she will move me next to my friend. \n\nWhich is good and all, but she did not even recognize the whole fact that she totally humiliated me I front of the whole class. \n\nAnd now that she knows she is been whispering to me, and giving mr extra attention. She keeps coming up to me, and asking me if I have any questions that I feel comfortable to ask, and then literally told me \u201chey, can you whisper into your friends ear the answer, since you cannot talk.\u201d Write down what you need from her. She is trying but missing the mark for you so she will likely be receptive. We often imagine people are much better mind readers than they really are &gt;and giving mr extra attention\n\nTeachers used to do that to me too. I assume they have good intentions (or at least no ill intentions) cause it does make sense in some situations. \n\nFor example, when someone is not a good student, you want to make sure that they can follow every step. So you go up to them several times and ask if they have any questions. (Which is still kind of humiliating even for people without SM, is not it? Idk, but it would make me feel dumb. The best solution would be that everyone feels comfortable enough to ask questions anyway.)\n\nI mean, I obviously do not know the exact situation, but... Maybe she assumes that you are not able to follow the class as well? Unfortunately, people sometimes assume that children with SM are delayed in their cognitive development.\n\nIn other words, she might see that you do not talk, assume that you are dumb and therefore she keeps asking you if you have any questions. She obviously does not understand the disorder, that is for sure. It is almost like coming up to someone and asking them directly creates **more** pressure on that person... \ud83e\udd28 That would be really hard for me, cause not only am I not able to talk, but I do not have the courage to even right a note, or I will get anxious, I cannot even get the nerve to say here in attendance.", "i spoke to my best friend for the first time i was on call with her yesterday and unmuted and whispered boo and then muted again. i have been friends with her for a year and she is never heard me speak before.\n\nshe said i had a beautiful voice and we are going to try again tonight :) i am proud of you!! it is takes a lot of courage to do that, keep up the amazing progress my friend. :)) Ahh wow, this takes me back to when I was first overcoming my mutism. It is such a rush is not it? When you get more comfortable speaking, you can keep doing it to people that do not know you have started to speak again. I remember waiting for a bus and an old school friend approached me, asking how I was, expecting the usual thumbs up. But I said \"Hi Andy, I am marvelous, thank you. How is it going?\" He was so surprised he literally fell over! Keep going and have fun with it! :)", "After Selective Mutism ?  Hello, I am 17 in my last year of highschool and I do not have SM anymore but still have bits of social anxiety. It is important to mention because it may have an influence on what I am going to talk about.\u00a0\n\nI just wanted to hear about others' experiences after overcoming SM and SA. How did you adapt and how did you learn \"how to be\" in society ? Since I have spent years and years being mute I am completely lost about social things because I did not learn how to behave at school. I find myself to be completely lost, even more because I have made friends with my parents and it is completely different then being friends with people your age. They tease each other, they make some specific jokes, they seem to have a persona and I do not know if I am overthinking all this, which causes me to be lost, or if I am really late about all this and have to learn. That is probably both. I personally fear crossing the line when making jokes, making it too long or bringing it too far when people already changed topics or are completely unrelated and people do not relate to it because it is not something to say or not in this context or not at the moment.\n\nNot to say that I am also very sensitive so I do not really like teasing but teenagers do that all the time so even jokes about me can hurt me but I do not show it. And since I am highly sensitive I am also very empathic and do not want to joke about others in fear of \"crossing the line\" (not knowing when it might become inappropriate) or hurting them but I have noticed that I put myself in others shoes a lot (is this even a bad thing?) but others do not do as much.\n\nThe thing is I am really confused about if this is a real problem or if I overthink because of SA.\n\nBefore there are comments about that I want to say that I do not have ASD which could cause me to be lost w social cues and non verbal and I do not think I have autistic traits.\n\nBut that is just my story. I would like to hear others' experiences about their feelings after they overcame SM, if they felt and if so how did it get better/how did you improve your social skills. Because I do not see anyone talking about the difficulties after they overcome SM they usually just talk about the experiences they had before but not after which makes me question too (Was it really a problem then if they do not talk about it ?)\n\nI also see a lot of people saying that you just have to be yourself but how can you be yourself when you do not have \"a self\" for social things. There is no thing such as being yourself, you do not have a stable \"self\" you are just malleable to some extent so you can adapt to situations and I did not learn how to behave in this situation so I cannot really \"be myself\". That is my problem.\n\nIn summary, I want your opinion on my story and also your own experiences about this if you have some.\n\nSorry if there is some mistakes, I am not native and thanks for your answers in advance ! I used to feel similarly about the inside jokes and such, and occasionally still do. I think it is possible, given the right set of stimuli over time, to desensitize yourself to all kinds of things. There are things I used to not be able to stand that now I do not care about at all or actually like, lol. In terms of social stuff my golden rule is to never take things personally. Even if people really are making fun of me, *most* of the time I can laugh with them. It is true I am weird, I do strange stuff sometimes and I do wish people were more curious and just ask me \"why/what are you doing?\" instead of making jokes but I know all of that is 100% their discomfort with whatever, not my problem. *They* are uncomfortable about their bodies so they make fun of mine, *they* do not feel comfortable with something in themselves that I am reminding them of--whereas I have total acceptance of myself in a lot of ways. I do not care if I look dorky, or what people think (unless it interferes with paying the bills, lol). \n\nJoking around with friends can be really fun, so long as they are not mean jokes. Having a sense of humor can get a person through most things, so it is a def. a trait worth developing. I do not think you are out of the woods just yet, hoss.\n\nI did not have a 'freezing' episode between... probably eight years old to 21 Not until I started to step out of my comfort zone to talk to girls in college.\n\nBut **now** I am over it. One hundred percent.\n\nYou are definitely overthinking it. Humor is more about timing than words. Do not force it, just look for those beats. If you have an ounce of humor yourself you will see your opening. Then it will be up to you to take it.\n\n\nDo not worry about saying that right thing, worry about saying what you want to say in the best possible way and let the chips fall where they may. Learn to let go of the outcome and you will be better for it.", "Hi Mods!

Growing up I never talked in school but I always spoke with friends and family and I could actually be quite extroverted. Then as I grew up I started becoming more self conscious and paranoid that others were thinking about me and judging me for being so quiet and I put on a fake persona where I would speak but it was always forcing words out of my mouth to please others, and it was exhausting and I lived in fear. That was then, and now I am comfortable with myself, and I am able to be quiet and not be ashamed of it. And I find that I am mostly quiet in new settings, like when meeting new people or in new places. I just really really DONT want to talk. I can talk but it will just be this fear persona talking. No, what you described is not Selective Mutism. Selective mutism is a severe situational anxiety disorder where a person experiences such severe anxiety in certain social settings (school, work, parties, family gatherings, everyday errands, etc) that it causes them to be unable to speak and communicate. They are able to speak and communicate freely in settings where they are comfortable, secure, and relaxed, such as at home. Please note that SM is NOT deliberate. People with SM really want to speak, but they literally just cannot. The words get \u201cstuck\u201d. And when I try to speak, no sound comes out. There is a big difference in wanting to talk or able to talk. If you are not able to talk even when wanting then only it is selective mutism", "Is this SM?

If you would like to be properly assessed, it is highly recommended to see a medical professional. ( section of the wiki.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/selectivemutism) if you have any questions or concerns.* I really do not know much about this, my only experiences are from my meltdowns, but I think the situations are quite similar.\n\nThese kind of selective mutism are not an *inability to speak*, per se. I know that I could talk if I wanted to. You say you think you are very close to being able to talk to. But, we cannot talk, because it is just so painful and anxiety inducing.\n\nI have good days, where I do not feel overstimulated at all and can navigate the world just fine. Being in a social context like an important interview or hanging out with friends can trigger that too. During these good days, speaking is not hard. At all. I do not even have to try. And I think that is how neurotypicals experience the world. You would not struggle with talking if you did not have selective mutism issues. You would not post here if not talking was a choice, because you have to be aware of a choice. The situation you are in right now is not a choice, it is something that is a part of you.\n\nSo yes, this definitely sounds like selective mutism. That feelings of \"almost managing to do something\" or \"feeling like you are not doing something because you choose too, but also you cannot move\" (most common in undiagnosed people) is I think very common with neurodivergencies, be it for executive dysfunction or selective mutism. Because we *can* physically do the thing, but brain says no", "How many people here are active? This place is pretty dead which makes sense since this is a rare and little-known condition and also because the people suffering from it are, well, mute. :x\n\nBut there are a lack of online groups / forums for people with our condition and I would like to hear and share personal experiences with it with other people who understand. There are other groups and subs for social anxiety but I think that sm is a very unique and different experience. So it would be really cool if this sub were to become more active. I am the parent of a 14 yo with SM.  I also would like to connect.  Facebook has a really good group that is active. What is the group name? Parents of children with selective mutism  There is also a group called SM space Cafe that is very active I agree it would be cool if it were more active.", "Do you have any speech disorder when you are able to talk? I stutter most of times Yep, I stutter. I am not sure what causes it, all I know is that at a young age, I fell out of the back of a truck and landed on my head. (Yee haw, the 90s) no proof of it, just a gut instinct. It was much worse when I was a kid, specifically in grade two, speech impediments are easy for bullies to target, it is plain as day, a distinction that makes differentiating and alienating simple.\n\nSpecifically, certain syllables. Usually T's, S's, P's, sometimes D's and B's. I feel it is caused me to fall behind on vocabulary and learning new words that could essentially concise entire sentences, I have had to use simpler words with less syllables to avoid stuttering all my life, I have kept my simple way of speaking. \n\nOne good thing came from this, I can translate academic writing to layman terms incredibly easily. \n\nBut, other than that, stuttering sucks. It really really really sucks. Not most of the time, but when I am having an episode, I usually start stuttering *a lot*, both before and after my SM kicks in :/ Do you tell people that you have sm? Here in Brazil nobody is aware of it is existence, so whenever i get questioned by my classmates about why I am writting notes on my phone to communicate during a random nonverbal episode I blame it on my stutter because it is easier to explain and more noticeable. Also, my parents and my best friend do not believe i am a stutterer because *sometimes* i can talk smoothly when i am alone with them, so they always tell me that i am just shy and nervous N\u00e3o te preocupa! Growing up in Brazil myself, I had never heard of it. It lead to some pretty bad situations, but once I was able to \"figure out\" what I had, I was able to explain it to close friends and family, who then helped me navigate these situations. \nI have been living in the UK for about 5 years now, and, unfortunately, my experiences have been pretty similar from the previous ones. People just seem to generally not be familiar with it.\n\nOne thing that has helped me is to contact my school/university and explain the situation to them. That way, it avoids professors accidentally \"putting you on the spot\" or judging you for not being able to speak. As for classmates and all, I have found it freeing to being open about it, to avoid confusion - however, that is just my personal preference, and yours might be different depending on what suits you best :) Putz, went through something very similar and it sucks. My mom, for example, only really kind of understood it with time and when I started treatment with my therapist (which I know is not an option for everybody). Educating them on how stuttering is often associated with psychological factors may help them better comprehend what you are going through. Communication is key. Maybe showing them some medical material (like pamphlets or educational videos) can help them understand Do you tell people that you have sm or blame your non-verbal episodes on your stutter? Mess up my \"r\"s when I am stressed enough for that but not stressed enough to go non verbal, the occasional small \"anxious stutter\" as well, but most of my verbal time I have nothing. When I was smaller I could never roll my \"r\"s. Do you also elongate your words? I do not think that I do Oh ok Too be honest I do not really have any issues speaking whatsoever, at least no more than anyone else. I will slur my words a bit. But its interesting to see a few people here with a correlation. Do you think your SM could be caused by insecurities involving your speech? Both. Depends who I am talking to and which is more likely that they will understand.\n\nOther times I just say I had a brain fart. \n\nIt comes down to whichever is easiest. usually I speak fine when I can speak, though I am dyslexic which is a language processing disorder so I do not always pronounce words correctly or put them in the right order on the first try. but, whenever I am having a particularly bad day or am on the cusp of going mute, I tend to stutter and my voice goes really hoarse", "Living a normal life after 18 years of talking to nobody ", "Quiet person at 21 shortly after moving to NY I realized I was screwed,  no social skills, I was probably closer to disabled than normal functioning. This was all due to bullying and severe abuse growing up that made me have selective mutism Is it too late to shatter my reputation? Are you able to support yourself tho? Never too late.", "Selective Mutism &amp; Autism Can you have selective mutism &amp; autism? Or is it one or the other? You can easily have both. It is common for people with autism to also have SM. How? What do you mean? Autism usually comes along with a lot of other disorders. That is not to say a lot of SMers also have autism, it is just that autism causes SM if that makes sense. It is common to have multiple disorders diagnosed rather than just one. How do you know if you have both, does not make sense. Pretty sure SM is just an extreme anxiety disorder while autism is a socializing disorder. I have heard that selectively mute people can hold a regular conversation like an normal person when they are comfortable while a person with Aspergers can conversate with anybody but tend to say the wrong things. I do not think they are linked at all but are very similar. That is right. It is also not unknown that autism comes along with anxiety disorders and such, and SM is one of them. They would have symptoms of both. I would say autism could be linked to SM, but SM is not linked to autism Then how do I know if I have autism too, because I think I could hold a normal conversation without fucking up. You could not know for sure unless you see a psychologist. We are not professionals by any means Idk, I think I have had brain fog my whole life so I do be saying stupid shit all the time, that is what also keeps me from socializing with people. This might help you: \n\nIt explains the difference between SM and autism in depth. Ok so you told me that most autistic people have SM but in the article it says the opposite. I never said most. It is definitely not unheard of, but SM is still rare. I know quite a few people with both My son has both. With lots of therapy he has mostly grown out of his SM. It still rears it is head when he feels extra anxious, or is asked a question that he feels is high stakes. For the most part he is able to communicate when he needs to. A lot of anxiety disorders may come as a result of autism, for example social anxiety and social phobia which I have. I am on the spectrum and I have a fear of social gatherings because it is just a lot of things happening at once and it is impossible to predict what will happen. Us on the spectrum like to be prepared and told everything beforehand and struggle with sudden changes (and changes in general). There is also the risk that you will be yelled at or insulted out of the blue which adds to the anxiety of course. It is important to know that social anxiety, and anxiety in general, is not a neurodivergence or personality disorder in the same way but is something that many parts of the population may suffer from. I have both:) People with selective mutism are very unlikely to feel graceful socially even around people they feel comfortable around. There is also the fact that sometimes the underlying issue that can make a person with autism dislike or avoid things like parties, sensory difficulties (SPD), can also be an issue for people with SM. \n\nPeople with autism can have \"normal\" conversations with others. It is a complex issue, and awkwardness vs \"normal\" social functioning is not necessarily the defining factor. I have both. It is more like, SM is pretty uncommon generally, but when you look at justs people who have autism, then it is not that rare. OCD is another anxiety disorder that can commonly occur alongside autism (I have even heard that some of the stereotypical traits people associate with autism are not autism, but OCD), but the only relationship between the two is that they are not uncommonly co-morbid. But one does not cause the other, and you do not have to be diagnosed with one to get the other diagnosis, etc. Yeah, I even get nervous when talking my family members that I normally talk too.  &amp; then there is also just people who say the wrong things in a conversation... That is key, you need to communicate when supposed to, other than that, your fine.", "Does this count as selective mutism? Basically I used to be a huge arguer a kid, but over time I learned that no matter how I respond when someone asks me certain things or is angry with me I would still get in trouble so rather than lying (would not get believed and might still get in trouble, was never always sure the answer they were looking for) I took to not responding at all (still got in trouble but ran out of things to do about it) so now whenever someone asks me a question I do not want to answer, perceive I could get any measure of criticism from answering, do not know what answer they are \u201clooking\u201d for, or do not know the answer to etc... I just go completely mute and just shut down until they give up and leave me alone. If they force a few words out of me I sound like a squeaky little kid, it is more like a strained half whisper and probably wince after every word. \n\nIt was kind of an issue at my work, I am a girl but I work in trades and got cut by a rusty nail, boss asked me if I had gotten my tetanus shot, (required information for him to know in such circumstance) and I realized I did not think I had because... I was a difficult child to vaccinate (deathly fear of needles) and in grade 9 managed to avoid all attempts for the school nurses to do so. I was more scared of his response to me saying no then the actual possibility of getting a deadly infection and I could not lie so I just completely clammed up and went silent, but I cannot stop doing it at this point, it is an ingrained response to being questioned. (Not sure how I still work there but that is another matter...) it could be selective mutism but sounds like maybe a combo of that and helplessness syndrome \n\n\n\nLearned helplessness is behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused from the subject's acceptance of their powerlessness: discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented. Upon exhibiting such behavior, the subject was said to have acquired learned helplessness. Over the past few decades, neuroscience has provided insight into learned helplessness and shown that the original theory actually had it backwards: the brain's default state is to assume that control is not present, and the presence of \"helpfulness\" is what is actually learned. At those times could you go to another place at work and type your answers - it could be an agreed accomodation in advance.", "Has anyone else had professionals completely ignore/belittle your diagnosis? I say this because i have had multiple therapists and doctors had SM explained to them by my mum only for them to ignore it and force me to answer or make comments about me being rude or acting like a child.\n\nProbably the worst experience was only a month or so ago when we had mental health nurses visit after a crisis. My mum said i might not talk because im selective mute but i can communicate in other ways. And they just said \u201cwell we cant help if you dont talk\u201d. I tried writing things down and they wouldnt read it. I whispered to my mum that i was uncomfortable and one of them loudly announced that because i was speaking to my mum i could speak to them, and that i was being rude. It was horrible and they eventually left me in a worse state than i was when they arrived.\n\nI just wish professionals and especially mental health professionals had more understanding and even training in working with nonverbal / selective mute / mute people. Same.. they literally made me sit in a room in complete silence waiting for me to talk when they clearly knew I was mute. it stayed like that.. Ive had that one before :( im sorry that happened to you My school counselor tried to gaslight me into believing that SM doesnt exist, and when i told her that I was diagnosed with SM by a professional... Straight silence. I do not think I have met a single counselor that helped me, and most of them were rude as hell Yep, my first counselor kept trying to convince me that I had autism no matter how many times I tried to explain to her about selective mutism. Constantly told that I can talk just fine, and that I must be making up the times I could not talk. I just wanted to say that they probably would not have helped too much anyways if they are this closed minded. It would be good if they had more training sure but nothing is keeping them from respecting the fact that you cannot talk. Even if you were able to talk, they should respect if you did not want to for x reasons. And if it is been explained to them that you *cannot* talk they should respect it.\n\nI hope you will find a therapist who will help you soon ! This makes me so angry for everyone. I was so lucky to have a child in my group who struggles with it too. I was told  that  she is just stubborn and moody and refuses to take part. But I recognised myself right away in her. Literally all it took to get her engaged was just saying it is OK if you do not speak to me we will find a different way to communicate. That was it, that was all it took and not one single, fully trained adult could be bothered to do it. I consider these people the 'Assholes.' To put it blunt.\n\nIt is already been openly disclosed I am 'Selectively Mute.' All they do is make assumptions, when they should ask \"What does that fully mean?\" Ok, that is great and they should ask that...but they just get personally offended. I wonder if SM is the reason why I tend to always give people the benefit of the doubt because of this non-sense.\n\nAnd it especially sucks because if I do talk, it feels like now they are going to expect me to. It just hurts us more and more, it is shocking that those people are even in those professions. \n\nI tend to more get annoyed than anything because by the point in which this happens, I have already deemed you as someone I would never want to talk to in the first place, and I am glad that I never did/will. Yes, I call it the false knight professional. They become so absorbed with them being the one to get the mute person to talk they forget the mute person is a human. It is so easy for them to project themselves onto SM. They do it all the time for things like cats or dogs where they make up these funny voices and stories for them. When they encounter a SM they tend to do the same and project onto their \"blank\" canvass if you will. Sometimes is a narcissist attitude as well they feel like they deserve you communicating with them in the way they think they need.\n\nI am sorry this happened to you and all of us here. I know we are not blank canvasses and we have the right to communicate in a way that makes us feel safe. It is not about them and they should remember that. My shrinks always attribute it as a symptom of anxiety. They will not even talk about how autism affects me, they literally shut me down when I try to talk about autism symptoms and I have a professional diagnosis. \n\nThe therapy I have received for SM was mostly playacting stressful situations. It was only effective in the specific, rehersed situation. It did not help with any other SM moment. It did help with preventing stressful situations by learning how to be more honest abd direct with my needs so things did not happen to upset me as often.", "Does this sound like selective mutism? As a child, I was intensely bullied throughout school. Thrown down stairs, tripped over, spat on, slapped with steel rulers, shoved, laughed at, teased, had things stolen off me. This began as young as playgroup, which meant over the course of time I eventually got diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but not SM. In school, around the age of 8 I began to experience trouble with speaking in class. It was not typical issues, such as being afraid of talking in front of a crowd, but whenever someone tried to talk to me, I would not be able to get a single word out. It feels like my vocal chords are sewn shut, or my lips have been torn off, or my tongue has been cut in half, because no matter how much I want to speak I cannot. It has always been an issue. I cannot talk in class, even in college I cannot speak, which means I have never been able to make friends or mix with peers as speaking is difficult. \n\nThe only thing I am able to do is write on a whiteboard, but that alone is humiliating. Whenever I attempt to speak, it only comes out as a small croak or harsh whisper. I cannot raise my voice, otherwise I start to feel uncomfortable. It is not just the inability to speak that troubles me, I become frozen. I cannot move so easily, everything about me is robotic and uncomfortable. Walking becomes difficult, moving becomes difficult. \n\nMost of the time, in class, over the last 12 years, has been me glued to a chair in the corner of the room unable to move or speak. If I wanted, for example, a new pencil, I could not get out of my seat to go grab one. I was stuck. Despite how much I wanted to move, I was stuck. My head goes blank, I find myself staring into space. Cannot ask anyone for help, cannot raise my hand. \n\nAnd it has overlapped into my everyday life, too. When I am out in public, I cannot speak and get the same physical response. It is like the words are stuck on my tongue and cannot come out. Even when I have tried forcing this. So whenever I am out with the family, my parents, siblings, I am unable to speak to them as long as I am in public. \n\nThis all changes once I am in a quiet area, with no people, say for instance a park bench far out of the way. Or at home. In the car. Sitting at a table in the corner of a caf\u00e9. Once I am out of a public place, talking becomes easy and it frustrates me to no end. I start wondering why I cannot speak like this in public, but only at home. Why cannot I raise my voice and be normal without issue? \n\nThis has destroyed my social life. Throughout school, I have had no friends. I have been isolated at home, it is gotten to the point where I am nearly housebound. The impression people have on me, is a quiet kid who does not have a personality. I am easily forgotten about, and left out of group discussions. And it hurts, as there are people I would love to get to know, if only my head did not continue to f\\*ck me over.\n\nI have tried getting this issue looked at before, only to be told by therapists that I should not self-diagnose. I am not sure what it is like where you are, but for me they are not so quick to diagnose you with anything, and usually issues are overlooked as they administer you anti-depressants to get you off their list. \n\nI have tried getting people to understand, but they dismiss it as typical shyness. I wish it were, because then I could get over it alone. I feel like it is stunted my development into the real world, because I have not been able to form connections with others. Work has not been easy, holding down part-time jobs has not been easy as there is a lot of clich\u00e9-attitude here, which means if you are not apart of the picture you are given a hard time. \n\nIt is got me spiralling downwards. Does not help the fact I am diagnosed with moderate depression, which means everything piles up. Wish I could break out of this. SM affects people in different ways. I think as long as you can speak to some people (like family) normally and not to a lot of other people, that is probably enough for a diagnosis.\n\nSM does not only affect your ability to speak to/infront of people, but also in the ways you listed.\n\nI have almost the exact same thing as you and was diagnosed at 5, when I started to stop speaking to my family. This is definitely SM. I can relate to this so much it hurts. I would start by trying to get diagnosed. A diagnosis is the first step of treatment. But like you said, not a lot of psychologists understand SM. Most seem to think it is either deliberate or behavioral issue. Because of this I would put a lot of thought and research in who you go to. You might actually have better luck with a speech language pathologist. Many of them have heard of SM, and some even know how to treat it. Just want to say, whoever downvoted this, do me a favour and shove up far up your ass. Because I cannot help the way I present my posts. Sorry it is not interesting or coherent enough, was only looking for an opinion. And as for the two comments below, thanks for being kind to me. It does sound like SM. I am almost certain it is SM, it just feels better having someone else tell me what it sounds like. \n\nI would happily pursue a speech language pathologist, but I am not sure the NHS would even take the time to find me one of those. Again, they are not so keen on diagnosing you with a click of a finger. You have got to go through hurdles. Brought this up many times before, only to be dismissed with \"maybe you need to increase your Sertraline dosage\". I have been on anti-anxiety pills before, but it does not do much when you cannot physically get yourself to speak in certain situations. Been this way since a child. We are not here to give diagnosises. You should see your GP as soon as possible to get a formal diagnosis. That way you can start treatment. I am very new here. I had selective mutism from when I was age 8 until 15, when I was taken to a speech therapist (a family friend) who cured me in a few weeks. Nobody knew anything about SM in those days. The only treatment was to get the strap on the hand or the cane on the bum for my apparent refusal to speak. Of course that did not help at all. I could not buy things from a shop or tell a bus driver where I wanted to go.\n\nIt makes me quite angry at the ignorance of teachers and medical professionals. I do hope they are not so ignorant these days. \n\nI was recently invited to give a speech to hundreds of medical professionals about autism. They were writing an autism manual. They were rather astounded at my assertion that they should treat autistic people as potentially very clever and useful. (My IQ is 135 and I am fairly rich after a life of hard work). They wanted a copy of my speech!", "Anyone doing counseling or have been in counseling \u2014 how is it going/how did it go? I am currently in counseling since November 2019. I do not really think it is helping, but I am not really given the choice to say \u201cno\u201d either. (My mother is forcing me to go)\n\nI do talk to my counselor. I am learning things I already know about my crappy life. It just feels like a waste of time to go to something I do not really care about. \n\nI really only talk to one of my friends, my mother, sister, father, and a cousin. I know that is small, but if I am in a store somewhere with my friend or a family member I will speak out loud and talk to them because I do not know anyone in the store. \n\nI think this is my way with coping and I am doing fine on my own.\n\nSorry I went a little off topic. I think therapy is good for everyone in one way or another. The problem is, not every therapist is right for everyone. A perfectly good therapist just might not be giving you the kind of therapy you need. It took me going through a few before finding my current one, and now that I have gotten to know her over the course of half a year or so it helps tremendously. It kind of feels like having a friend you can vent to about all of the bad stuff happening, except it is their job so you do not feel like a burden. That is what it is for me anyways, but what is best can be different for everyone. \n\nIt also might be the way you are going about it. Therapy only really started helping me when I realized the key, which is to try to intentionally stumble upon sore spots and the like while with my therapist. Like, all of the things you normally spend your whole life trying not to think about, just run straight at them with your therapist in the room. Every time that happens for me I will heatedly rant in a very uncharacteristic way and let out a bunch of steam knowing I will not but judged for what I say. And then every time I am between thoughts my therapist occasionally chimes in with some quiet and nurturing advice related to what I was talking about, or just an observation to prove she was listening. It helps me a lot and I do not end up doing that venting to people close to me, which allows those relationships to focus on the positive.\n\nIronically, my first comment on this sub about mutism is long and rambly. How old are you? How long have you been going to counseling? I have gone to counseling two times, but I will not talk about the first time since the guy basically just talked about the bible and God. The second time I got this counselor who was very nice to me and made me feel comfortable enough to speak. The thing is, I completely lied about everything to them. I made up stories that I was making progress but in reality I was stuck in the same place. I managed to get out of counseling a couple months after that by making them think I could finally survive on my own. There is not really a point to this story but I guess I am sort of an example of what happens when you do not open up to your counselor. Im stuck in the exact same place and have made 0 progress on talking to others. Anyways, good luck :) Twenty-six (recently turned), since November 2019. And she is \u201cmaking\u201d you go? I would think at your age she would respect your input on the matter. &gt; Like, all of the things you normally spend your whole life trying not to think about, just run straight at them with your therapist in the room. \n\nI will have to give this a shot", "How to talk to crush I am in high school and there is this girl in one of my classes who I really think is cute. I, however, do not talk at all in that class and do not really think she even knows if I exist. I want to talk to her but I feel it would be weird if I striked up a conservation considering I do not really talk at all. Not sure what to do.  What is she like? Think you can get her to laugh? Can you start by emailing her? Idk but the last time I was in that situation I was in 7th grade, the stigma was not really there...and I was ready to talk for her, but I took youtube literally.........and nothing happened.\n\nI had two friends in that class though, my two top friends at the time. She told me my drawing was nice, and I ignored the shit out of her....that was the advice I took.....but now if I was in the same situation idk what I would do.\n\nSo yeah, I have no advice....other than HS really is not that impactful after you graduate, though that does not necessarily help.\n\nEdit: And near the start of that class I had with her, it is art so we throw a ball around to say something about ourselves....I could not think of anything so I said nothing.....MS was definitely the chance for me, to change, but I never did.............I shutdown in MS. Do not shutdown. Maybe yeah. I just feel that might be weird if we are in the same class. She might wonder why I did not just talk to her She is pretty interesting got a lot of unique interests. We are both into politics so might be something. I might be able to. I can be pretty funny at times but when my anxiety is high, as it usually is in school, I rarely have the confidence to joke about much. You could explain in your email that you are nervous to talk to her. I think an email could be a good icebreaker, but only if you are comfortable with it. Ok yeah that is a good idea thank you for the advice. I am just always worried something like that will backfire and she will think I am weird or something. Guess that is part of my problem, worrying about what others think Worrying about what other people think about you is normal, but it can become a problem if you worry about it too much. Try to think about what the worst thing that could happen would be. Like, you email her and she is not interested. Okay, so that might suck a little bit but it is not terrible. And think of other possible outcomes too. She may get to know you and you will make a new friend. She may get to know you and like you as more than a friend. She may not respond at all. If you can think of all of the possible outcomes of you talking to her or emailing her, and all of those outcomes are things you can live with, then it is worth it to try. And if she thinks you are weird, that is okay too. Weird does not mean bad. Personally, I think everyone is weird in one way or another. Good luck to you with whatever you decide to do and let me know how it goes if you want to. That is good. Well, humor has always been a sign for me that a girl is interested, she is going to laugh at your jokes or she is not. Not a joke she is got to think about, could be physical comedy or a combination. I stole a lot of my best material from ( scene.\n\nHumor's good, a good place to start; it is disarming. It will make that weird/awkward factor just slide right off. I suggest you lead with that.\n\nA more involved lesson, something that will come to you with time is to learn to let go of the outcome. Once you are older and you have some experience build up. Rn you will blame yourself if it falls through and dumb luck if it does not. Takes time. DM her Thank you so much! I think I really needed to hear that bit about not caring so much about what others think. I will think about it and might just go with the email. Thanks again", "How do I explain it to my manager?

Well, this is a lovely surprise.\nHi everyone! I experienced SM mostly between 0-4 years old, my mum saw it as a concern and got the GP to refer me to a speech therapist. I still experience it now but not as debilitating. Job interviews and talking to people I cannot do a small soft search on causes my throat to close up and cold water is its best friend. I used to dislike phone calls, I still get nervous but if I write down what I want to say then it helps. Videos? Forget about it if it involves talking...dancing?

Almost all of my close friends that I opened to about having SM while younger seem shocked that it was a condition! Me too! Hopefully we can be friends one day? I know making friends in high school is extremely stressful and difficult.\n\nI have been thinking about entering a pageant and really want to bring SM to the forefront in terms of making people aware that we exist and the many different variations of SM. However, I am worried about the actual speech part in front of people and cameras. When I mentioned it to my therapist (SM) even she was shocked but happy that I was able to share that with her. \nI imagine if I were to tell people they will either be: \nThat explains why you acted that way or I had no idea. \n\nJust reading a few posts last night was a tear bearing moment but I am glad we have a bit more information now than we did a few decades ago.

I am laying in bed at 5:45 in the morning, unable to sleep for the last few hours. Lately I have been curious about neurodivergence (specifically adhd/asd) and bouts of mutism. So I did a little googling and I read the definition of selective mutism and lo and behold it fits me to a T. When I was a kid, I was just called shy. When I got a little older I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and social anxiety. As a young adult I was diagnosed with PTSD. I am curious as to why, in all my years of therapy, in all my describing the blankness in my head when faced with an anxiety provoking situation (especially when I was in school), no therapist ever suggested I may have SM. If someone had suggested this, I may have been able to seek specific treatment. Instead, I am 30 years old and still cannot hold a conversation with a stranger because my mind goes white and I stare at them blankly. At most I laugh at random times to seem engaged (which frequently backfires).\n\nI am not sure what I am here writing this for. I am frustrated and tired of living like this.

How do I bring up the fact that I need to be called by a different name/pronouns?\n\nThanks for any advice you have. Most, of not all, jobs require communication of some sort.

It is such a heavy focus of mine to overcome SM that I have given up watching YouTube normally, I do not watch Netflix on my own (only with family at night), and I have stopped playing Minecraft out of fear that it takes up too much time that I could be using to improve on my SM issues. I will sit at the Kitchen table at night with my Mom just hoping she will talk with me and help my issues be better off.\n\nI feel like all these issues people tend to care about on the day to day, I could give little to no care about. I actually just transferred colleges today and it does not concern me, at all. Though I am still down mentally over my SM issues. In a way I feel like my little care towards anything else makes it hard to make any sort of conversation because I have no focus or care to anything that would I would talk about. My Dad will ask me if I know who is singing on the radio to get me to talk, and in that instance I just do not care to respond because it is so uninteresting to me.\n\nI tend to only really talk when asked about my issues. I have tried to talk more fluently, although it is quiet when asked too. I think it all in my mind and I roll with it while speaking, as like I am thinking in my mind...although it is quiet, as I said. \n\nAnd my main motivation which was really a shot in the dark anyways was the hope I would potentially talk with this girl...but at the same time I want that, it scares me too much to mention it to my parents or make any moves on my own. I do have their number (but it is via my Mom, which my Mom did not give me the number, I just took it secretly)...so unless my parents push me...really my Dad since my Mom has not mentioned it since probably a day after I crossed paths with her, and even if they do the path of pursuing that, still scares me....and is probably it is own reason as to why I do not want to do anything about it on my own. If I did tell them that was part of the reason I was down, I would also tell them that it scares me at the same time to pursue anything. I have NEVER discussed relationship hopes with anyone before. I only have with my friends and that \"crush\" was not even real, I was just so convinced of it by them, that I was like \"sure, whatever\" to them....They think that was my first crush when I had one before that, that was a real crush.

Thank you for reading. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nHmm maybe we all are. If we try. It is not something she would do and even if she did the media would not report on it. Interestingly I described the symptoms of selective mutism (mostly during panic attacks) to the letter without knowing what it was. Multiple doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists in two countries could not explain it and made me feel weird for being unable to speak. I also cannot hear or process thoughts but the mutism comes first.\n\nSo there is a huge lack of awareness. I first heard the term in the recent Netflix series on the mind, mentioned in passing during the anxiety episode. I immediately paused it and googled it, amazed that there was such an accurate diagnosis that all my doctors over almost 20 years were oblivious too. Coincidentally two days later I watched a Democracy Now video with Greta Thunberg and heard her mentioning it again.\n\nIn my case I only get mutism when a panic attack is building up. Then I cannot understand the words being said to me, start to shake so violently it looks like a seizure, and am basically unaware of my surroundings and cannot speak or hear.\n\nDoes anyone else here experience panic attacks this way? I was also nearly diagnosed with autism as a child but they ruled it out solely because my eye contact and empathy were good. Aside from that though, I fit the aspergers criteria perfectly. I was forced to quit school at age 14 because I was not classified and could not go near the school without having a panic attack.\n\nThe diagnosis shifted from just depression and anxiety when I was 12, to panic disorder, agoraphobia, major depressive disorder etc. But by my 20s the consensus was OCD and ADHD. I do not feel that completely covers my symptoms but there is so much overlap I am not going to try to self diagnosis. \n\nLike Greta I consider my hyper focus a gift (and a curse sometimes). I research the shit out of whatever my current topic of interest is and memorise every detail without trying to. I also remember numbers for a long time after seeing them once, remember facts from years ago about my topics of interest, and excel at finding patterns. That is how they initially put me in a gifted program...my ability to find multiple complex patterns in kindergarten on those simple \"fill in the missing number\" tests. They gave me an IQ test and put me in a gifted program. I never studied and did not attend school that much but excelled at tests so my test scores were the highest in my town. Yet I struggled with simple things like tying a knot in gym class. I could not watch someone do something and then emulate it with my hands. I spent my life hiding and avoiding the scenarios where I could not do simple things with my hands or understand spoken directions, and because of that I think a diagnosis was missed.\n\nPhew that was a mouthful but I am hoping somebody read that and can advise me on whether I should rule out autism. How does one even go about that as an adult, especially considering how similar OCD and ADHD can seem to high functioning autism. I had no idea what selective mutism was until a few days ago. I looked up Greta on Wikipedia to see who she was. I came across selective mutism in her wiki page so I googled it and was shocked when I read about myself. And that there are others like me. \n\nI always had difficulties as a kid with speaking. It was so painful to talk around people I was not comfortable with (which was everyone except my immediate family and very close friends). My mind would \u201cshut off\u201d and I could not get words out.

Her teacher actually became a blonde.\n\nI was horrified sending her there and hoping for the best.  I started contacting the district when she was only 3 but was ignored.  She started school unable to communicate with anyone there.  I had her diagnosed privately bc I knew something was different.  Sometimes even I do not get her \"words\" even though I am mommy.\n\nShe is now in 4th grade, I addressed with the teacher day one as always.   Her teacher said she understood and would work with her.  I wish that was the case.\n\nHer teacher has given her lower grades for lack of class participation, I have contacted the teacher when she does not understand the subject she cannot ask for help so I have to tell the teacher if she does not understand, I know how to get math answers but not the current format they want the work shown in.\n\nMy daughter was even brave enough to write her teacher a letter explaining that she gets \"stage fright\" trying to talk in front of the class or directly to her teacher.  My amazing little girl asked if she could have a notebook to write notes back and forth with her teacher, but the teacher did not follow through.\n\nWe spend about 2 hours a day on homework and she is genuinely not learning at school.

Maybe you can learn how to navigate the system by following in their example. Just keep in mind that they are not automatically all great parents or doing enough for their kids. I say this as a past SM sufferer whose silence was interpreted as a personal affront by my mother. She was always my biggest bully and critic :( Your daughter has the right to certain accommodations, if the school is not providing them, it is possible it is illegal in your area, it depends. I am not necessarily encouraging you to sue or something like that, but please fight for fair grading and reasonable accommodations. Like I said, you are not the only parent who struggles to get their kid's different needs met. Parents of children with autism, ADHD, or other conditions could be a source of social support and guidance.\n\nI personally was a horrible student ages 10 to like 15-16 because of my mutism. I am currently studying but struggle with feeling inadequate and at times even avoid study time because it reminds me of how I felt going to school both with different needs and being abused and neglected at home. I am a college drop out, at a certain point in my life, I decided I needed out of the school system as I knew it. It was not until I felt I had real control over my overall mental health that I took the steps to get back on track with my desired career path, although I am not back in school, just taking online classes.\n\nFor now, I recommend ( to supplement her learning. I know it might sound like a flimsy fix, but that YouTube channel seriously set me on track to pursuing higher education a while back. Those online tutorials made me feel like I was actually learning and I gained that first little bit of confidence in my abilities that motivated me to actually attempt being good at school and my grades did get a lot better. I did not drop out  of college due to bad grades, it was because of my mental health issues (SM and anxiety/depression, and I think also trauma).  EDIT- It was also because I felt like my relationships with my professors were deteriorating due to miscommunications and because of bullying by a professor in one particular class I also did badly in. This professor did not tolerate questions at all, no I am not exaggerating, and especially not if you would been fucking up all semester like me, so I was just totally lost and did not have the social support that could have been a buffer-END OF EDIT Khan Academy was also my introduction to the huge amount of free educational material there is online.

First of all I apologize that your mom was a bully.\n\nAlthough I am never aggressive or speak down to my daughter, I have locked myself in the bathroom and cried many times bc I feel like I have earned her \"words\" more than anyone.  I fight for her and legally the district is supposed to address this.\n\nMy other daughter is loud, I do not have to worry that someone will hurt her and she will not tell me.  I am terrified of being in an adversarial relationship with the school who has unsupervised  access to my daughter every day that cannot tell me that something happened.\n\nThis year I see her losing interest in learning which scares me bc she has always wanted to and enjoyed learning.\n\nI do not know why but neither of my girls like Khan for some reason.  I do not know what it is.\n\nI was stunned that my daughter actually wrote her teacher a letter explaining her \"stage fright\" and offering to start a notebook with the teacher.\n\nI am seeing her curiosity return away from school.  I am afraid that like you in time she is not going to want to go back to school if I keep pushing her into a system that even with accommodation was not made for her.\n\nFor you personally if you had been home schooled and your mom had been supportive do you think you would feel differently right now?\n\nI am afraid of failing her but also afraid of the damage that school will cause.  Until this school year she is gotten 100 on everything now she gets 40 to 50.  \n\nShe is been BEGGING to homeschool but I have been saying no.  My husband has brain cancer and I am about to have major spinal surgery as soon as this is over.  I cannot physically be everywhere.  I do not want her to get lost either.  She is so sweet, so kind, she is so good that I honestly feel like I do not deserve her, how blessed I am that she is my daughter.  Letting her down would crush me also if I can avoid it.\n\nI am interested in your perspective bc you went through this.\n\nThank you for your time \n\nGod bless Hi, I am not entirely qualified to be giving advice on how to handle this situation since I am young, but I will tell you my experience. I have had SM as long as I can remember. Some of my teachers in elementary school made it hell for me because they did not understand and thought I was being defiant. I began homeschooling in middle school when my SM and anxiety became crippling. I was out of school for a year and a half. When I returned to public school to start high school, it was a bit difficult but I was doing far better and handling everything easier than I had been when I left school. I think the homeschooling did help me a lot, but it also allowed me to fall into bad habits academically. \n\nTo relate this to your daughter, see if you can establish a 504 plan or an IEP with the school. Having these helped me a lot and gave me accommodations so I was not placed in stressful situations that I could not handle. A good teacher is really important with her being so young, at least in my experience. See if there are other fourth grade classes/teachers that your daughter could transfer into. If you do pursue homeschooling, see if your state (assuming you are in the U.S) has a Home and Hospital program or something similar. I had this for half of a year before I started online schooling. A teacher from a local high school would come to my house for a few hours and teach me. \n\nIf there isnt a way to find her another teacher, maybe see if her teacher will create ways to communicate. When I was in fourth grade, my teacher created hand signs with me so I could communicate with her in stressful situations. If she called on me to answer a question and I could not speak, I would scratch my nose and she would move on. In kindergarten, the teacher asked everyone to raise a fist if they had to use the bathroom so they would not interrupt anything by asking verbally. \n\nIf you homeschool your daughter, aim to have her back in public school as soon as you believe she is capable of handling it better. When I returned to school, I had a lot of anxiety the first few weeks because I was not very used to public school anymore. I understand you might not be able to put her in therapy, but you should try to find time for it because I learned a lot of coping skills in therapy that helped me. I also had a therapist that came to my elementary school at least once a week. Multiple students saw this therapist though so it may be difficult for you to arrange this with the school if your daughter is the only one that needs it. \n\nSorry if everything is a bit jumbled up. I am not too sure how to format this well and I was rambling a bit. \n\nTL;DR:\nHomeschooling may be beneficial for your daughter, but you should aim to have her back in public school as soon as she is ready. Try to work with the school to make accommodations for her if you decide to keep her in school. Make sure she does not develop bad academic habits because they will be hard to break\n\nEdit: I completely forgot to include this. In reference to your daughter receiving low grades for participation, see if her teacher will allow her to use a whiteboard to answer questions. She can show the whiteboard to the teacher with the answers on it. I still have teachers offer to give me whiteboards so I can participate. I have a child with SM that is the same age as your kiddo. I highly recommend finding the Parents of Children with Selective Mutism Facebook group. It is a big group and you will likely get more specific advice there than here. \n\nThat said, it sounds like it is time to schedule a 504 meeting and IEP meeting ASAP. All you have to do for the IEP meeting is write on a piece of paper that you want your daughter to be evaluated for an IEP and sign it. Give it to them and they legally have to start the process. Do not take no for an answer, you have rights, including the right to appeal their decision if they try to deny services/help. In the meantime, while you wait for IEP stuff to happen, tell them you need a 504 meeting. A 504 is for accomodations, like giving alternative options for verbal portions of lessons/projects/tests. \n\nYou are not alone in this. We were lucky enough to move to an area with specialists and now my child is verbal 99.9% of the time and the .1% she is not, we know how to work through those situations. This group on Facebook has given me a support that I did not know I needed. I am able to talk freely about what works and does not and share highs and lows with people who are in the exact same boat. Check it out, and maybe we can help support you too. &gt;a system that even with accommodation was not made for her\n\n...\n\n&gt;For you personally if you had been home schooled and your mom had been supportive do you think you would feel differently right now?\n\nThis question is way too hard. I honestly do not know what the best course for me would have been, but I can talk about what is helped.\n\nFirst, I never really admitted to myself I had SM til it was over. My parents were not supportive, and I was scared to face up to it on my own. So I think it would be really beneficial if your daughter really learns about herself and her anxiety. \"I have SM and I react like this when I get anxious\", \"I avoid others because I am so shy\". I feel like not knowing myself really harmed me. I could not see the problem I was dealing with and it made the problem grow and grow with time. So talking very openly, in a very explicit way about SM I think would really help. Therapy/possibly medication (although I do not know a lot about the types of treatments available to children) can help. It is hard to reach a goal when you do not even know what you want, so helping her understand her anxiety and what she wants her life to be like is a must.\n\nSecond, the way you react to her anxiety is going to be a huge factor in how she herself views it. So you have the power to make a positive impact by making it a point to say, \"SM does not make you less smart, capable or nice than others\", or \"You have SM and yet you have inherent worth, just like everyone else\".\n\nAlso, regarding the first quote above, you can succeed outside the school system. You can learn outside of school. There are plenty of things she already knows a lot about that do not involve school, make sure you talk about the strengths she already has. I am thinking learning a skill outside school can help her start to more intuitively understand that her learning is something she can have control over, whether other people are happy with her progress or illness or not. Thank you so much.  The perspective of someone young is what I need bc they understand.\n\nI do not think they will be going back this year, so rn could have her in daily therapy if needed, except in NY we are on lockdown and only phone therapy is being done at this point, would have been the perfect opportunity.\n\nUp until this year the teachers have been amazing.  This one has a dual degree, teachings and child psychology and I was thrilled at first but she cannot even remember that my daughter has needs.  My daughter gave her teacher a letter explaining that she gets there \"stage fright\" detailing exactly how that makes her feel,  in the letter my 9 year old asked if they could have a daily note book so my daughter could detail anything she did not understand that day or wished she could have told her teacher.\n\nUnfortunately my sweet daughter does not have a mean bone in her body and will allow others to treat her horrible without complaining.  I just learned yesterday, took from September to April that her current teacher dispite being qualified is not very understanding and even the notebook was too much for her to go along with.  My daughter showed me for 2 weeks she detailed all questions about what she did not understand, she gave to her teacher the end of each day and her teacher initialed that she read a few times.\n\nShe never once bothered to write back.\n\nI want my daughter to be in a school that helps her, she does not want to stand out.  They could potentially have services in an IEP but that would humiliate her.  She wants to stay where she has her little friends and I understand as a child to start now would be hard socially.\n\nIf in 4th grade she was not doing two hours of homework a day there would be time to bring to therapy but I feel as if the entire school day is wasted.\n\nI try hard to balance her needs with not wanting to make a big deal about it.  She is been happier and learning more without school but long term am worried may do more bad than good.\n\nThank you so much for sharing your knowledge with me.  I need to understand how she feels and think that others who have been through understand more than professionals.\n\nHave a good day \n\nThank you Thank you so much \n\nAm in NY so right now on lock down just trying to figure out what next\n\nShe loved school until this year and the thought of her losing interest in learning is scary Thank you \n\nI try so hard, she has heard drs refer to but she prefers to call \"shy\" or \"stagefright\" I have not pushed her to use words not comfortable with but she would prefer no one knows so it is a delicate balancing act.\n\nOne night she could not sleep, kept crying.  Next morning was exhausted. I Let her stay home.  I spoke to her when she was ready.  She was supposed to do a presentation in front of the entire class, she would prefer to walk through broken glass barefoot.  I called the teacher asking if she remembered my daughter's diagnosis, she forgot, AGAIN.\n\nSwitching classes would also get unwanted attention.\n\nI am hoping we can get therapy after lockdown before school starts again.\n\nThank you so much.  I cannot imagine being mean to my daughter, she is so sensitive and kind.  I cannot even say our dog is stinky in front of her or she says that I am hurting his feelings\n\nHave a good day, good luck, my daughter is very smart just learns differently, once you know how you learn will get easier.  :) I just wanted to add one more thing. Just like you might benefit from getting to know other parents with similar struggles, your daughter can benefit from getting to know other people like her.\n\nHere is an immediate fix for that:\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nI have found these types of videos where I can actually physically see others who experienced the same thing I did so healing, almost. They made me feel less alienated from everyone else, even though I know that people who suffer SM are a small minority. I really wish I would known I was not alone from the beginning. Please do not shield your daughter from other sufferer's experiences. I would honestly say meeting others like me in spaces like this or hearing their stories like in the above video has been so comforting and gave me strength even. Thank you so much I actually was taken out of school and homeschooled at the same age/grade for the same reasons (selective mute) so if you need any advice or someone to talk to you can always talk to me about it Thank you, would really like to know the good and bad bc honestly am torn\n\nrn on lockdown it is forced but we also have an online curriculum from the school bc of current situation \n\nThe stakes are so high, I do not want to let her down The good and bad of being homeschooled or of something else? \n\nMy situation was different because I had severe learning disabilities so my mom had a very hard time teaching me. \n\nI feel like maybe a small private school for kids who have anxiety is the best if you can do it. \n\nI dont think homeschool is the best because it is very lonely but public school can be hard to. \n\nBut there is ways to deal with it all.\n\nDoes she have social anxiety or is her anxiety only about talking? She is a cheerleader but moves her lips, nothing comes out and between she freezes, she USED to like school but now she lost interest in learning except at home, \n\nNow that we are on lock down she is happy to learn again \n\nI cannot afford private school, both my girls would rather be home with me which I do not understand, my youngest does not have friends out of school, will not talk on phone but usually will play with unknown children at friends barbecues,\n\nI am dyslexic myself.  I understand how much harder that makes it.\n\nI am surprised that she is not lonely, my older misses me but she does better with the structure of school.\n\nI guess lockdown is a sneak peek at how it would be without being able to bring her anywhere educational. I do not know if I am in a position to give advice on which one is better. I have had a bad experience with both homeschool (more accurately home instruction provided by public school) and public school. So I can at the very least talk about some other options.\n\nOption 1: Alternative schools. Alternative schools generally serve people who do not do well in a traditional public school setting for whatever reason. A smaller environment and more personalized attention are some of the potential benefits. I would encourage you to look into options for alternative schools in your area and see if any might be a good fit. I was in an alternative boarding school. My school district was required to pay for it, but I think it was a bit of a battle for my parents to get them to do so. I personally had a positive experience being placed there after I had recovered from selective mutism.\n\nOption 2: Homeschool as a temporary measure. There is a good chance that isolation will make the anxiety worse in the long run. If she is being homeschooled, it might be a good idea to get her in therapy with the goal to transition her back to either her current school or a school that is a more appropriate fit. As far as therapy, one option is placing her in an intensive outpatient program if there is one locally that is a good fit. Another option would be finding a therapist that is knowledgeable about the treatment of anxiety disorders. I missed enough school in the period that my parents tried home instruction and when I was in residential treatment that I ended up being a year behind my peers. But I was very much debilitated by my selective mutism, so being in therapy was not negotiable.\n\nOption 3: Residential Treatment. If one-on-one therapy and outpatient therapy are not options or not effective, then it might be worth looking into more intensive options. I can vouch for Rogers Memorial Hospital's residential program for OCD and anxiety in Wisconsin, but there may be similar programs that I am unaware of in other locations. They have a program for children 8-14. I would not be able to speak now if I did not do the work to recover the months I was there in their adolescent program. Residential treatment is expensive, but being immersed in a therapeutic environment can be extremely effective and health insurance should be able to pay for it.\n\nI do not feel comfortable saying one option is better than another or making specific recommendations because I do not know you and your child's entire story, but hopefully this comment is helpful. Feel free to ask me any questions about my experience. I wish the best for you and your child. Thank you so much.\n\nI think residential would be too traumatic, she has been ok when the teacher makes an effort, I also had to ask them to stop using her as the example of the good one in class who is not talking when they are not supposed to \n\nShe will not raise her hand, but will answer a specific question if asked but will not elaborate \n\nShe tried on her own writing her teacher a note explaining that she has stage fright and asking her teacher if they can write notes back and forth with a note book\n\nThe teacher with a dual degree in psychology has reduced grades for lack of class participation \n\nrn she is doing really well doing work from home.  She would like to be able to play with our neighbor but does not miss social interactions at school at all.  Unfortunately in NY there is no type of therapy not currently shut down.  Has been rough here.\n\nThank you so much for sharing the information I know it is been long, but I hope things are getting better for you. I wish my country allowed homeschooling - I remember always asking to be homeschooled, but it is illegal in my country to do so.\n\nMy mom watched me struggle a lot with bullying, bad grades, and shyness. She could not do much because we were very poor.\n\nI do not know what to say, but it did not limit my opportunities - just made things harder to learn. I know that if you need to make the hard choice of sending her back to school she will have difficulties, but hopefully she will grow up knowing that you were there every step of the way, learning how to help and growing together.\n\nMy suggestion, in the future, is to go online school for a degree. I have ASD and had an enormous difficulty regarding just paying attention and communicating with teachers. Now that I do not have noisy and bright classrooms to worry about I have a very high gpa, always getting straight As!\n\nAlso, always use youtube videos or apps to instigate her knowledge and curiosity. She is actually starting to miss her friends which I am surprised about.  She will run around and participate in PE but she does not actually speak to anyone \n\nWhat country are you from?  That is terrible that they do not allow parents a choice.", "Could this be selective mutism? Im currently doing some writing on Greta Thunberg and came across a video where she is asked a question and comes with a rather vague answer. I myself know nothing about selective museum (except for googling the symptoms), so i was hoping to get some insight from this community. Is giving short answers a trait of selective mutism? Thanks in advance.\n\nLink to video if interested:  Yes, it is. For those with SM that are able to be more verbal, it is often still quite hard for them to give longer responses/longer sentences, so it results in them giving short responses instead. It can even show as only being able to answer \u201chow are you?\u201d with \u201cgood,\u201d and not being able to add \u201chow are you\u201d, even if they want to. \n\nI hope that helps and makes sense. Thank you for this answer and yes it helps me a ton!\n\nI saw this video being used as a claim that Greta couldnt say anything without being handed a script by the \u201cbig media\u201d, so im glad theres a reasonable explanation behind this. Yeah. Scrips are sort of a coping mechanism for some SMers. I used to have to use them too. They actually do help alot in being able to speak/speak some more. When writing your report, say that Greta \u201cdisplays symptoms of Selective Mutism\u201d rather than saying \u201cGreta has Selective Mutism\u201d. It is a much more appropriate way of saying that she shows signs of this disorder without your teacher thinking you are diagnosing her yourself.", "any other family also at Brave Buddies NYC?   I do not think so look....\n\n Oh nvm", "Is it selective mutism\u2013\u2013or chronic catatonia? Intermittent mutism as a part of a spectrum of catatonic experiences  It is an interesting article, but I would question some of the phrasing, specifically the idea that selective mutism is a separate diagnosis to \"explicitly exclude autistic people\". Mainly because the reason for separating ASD and SM isnt to 'explicitly exclude autistic people' but to highlight that it is mutism specifically NOT caused by autism or speech difficulties. \n\nPeople with autism can also have SM, it is just that the autism would not be the cause of the mutism. This is an important distinction to make, as the methods of managing this symptom and the cause of the mutism would be different. \n\nIt also doesnt talk about deficits in executive function, something seen in both ASD and ADHD that is thought to be a key component in some of what the author describes as catatonia, such as scrolling on the phone until the battery dies instead of doing a necessary task. Im confused, this article's saying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \"Instead, we go mute intermittently, when we are experiencing sensory overload, are drained from performing at work or at an event, have anxiety over an interpersonal interaction, or have been alone for long enough to get out of the habit of speaking. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would only consider the anxiety part \"selective mutism\", cause everything else seems like things everyone experiences. Im not a professional and of course i could be wrong, but my experience with sm has been solely about anxiety/fear. if someone is mute because of sensory overload or another non-anxiety related reason, i think their condition should have name to avoid confusion and help prevent false diagnoses.", "I wish more people would understand this  I feel like it needs a name change Yes ppl piss me off thinking I am ignoring them Yeah its better than the old term elective mutism but still confuses some people", "I can not properly communicate with my Direct Family, how well do you communicate with your Direct Family? Is there any way in which SM may affect you with your Direct Family? So some of you probably know me already, but I thought of this driving home from Stop and Shop with my Mom tonight. I cannot communicate with my direct family, but I am wondering how people with SM who do communicate with their family...how exactly they are when doing so?\n\nFor me, a lousy 'yes/no' is usually the best communication I will make. It really does not make me nervous, but increasing volume is hard. When it comes to bringing anything to a conversation or making a joke, I do nothing of the sort. I can tell them some stuff in broken sentences, but again at a lousy volume. And more often than not I just do not want to talk to anybody, I also feel like if I did add to the conversation it would be so awkward, and that my thoughts are kind of irrelevant and stupid.\n\nSo I am just trying to get an idea and I know it sounds like a dumb question since communication with most of your families are probably normal....I am just wondering how so? And please be as detailed as possible. Is there any way your SM affects your direct family relations? For Example, is it hard to share secrets, or talk about relationships, etc. The only time SM affects my communication with my family is when we are out in public other wise I communicate normally to them.\n\nI do not think I had a typical upbringing so I do not know if they contributed to it.\n\nMy family had no friends growing up. My parents had no friends, my siblings had no friends it my mother always told us family over friends. So growing up I had my siblings and my cousins (some who lived with us). \n\nI am \"loud\" and make jokes, life of the party with my family at home but in public I turned into a statue basically. I did not smile, I did not laugh, I would not do anything that draws attention and I never spoke even when we were alone. The thought of anyone just showing up when I was talking was a risk I could not take. My sisters did not get it and they would tell me that I need to speak cuz my teacher said so or people thought I was weird. My brothers did not care when people asked them why I was so quiet they shrugged their shoulders and that was it. They never pressured me or tried to make me talk they accepted it so as a result I am much closer to my brothers and the brother right after me is my closest friend. \n\nAs we got older and we learned what SM was my sisters have gotten more understanding and we got closer. \n\nMy father (Narcissist/Asperger's/They are not sure which one) is not someone I confide in or talk to on my own for various reasons. Does not really have to do with my SM.\n\nMy mother has always been my rock and I tell her everything. \n\nNow my husband, I met him when I was just recovering from SM so my SM does affect our relationship in some ways. I talk to him wherever we are although it is very softly in public. Sometimes I am overwhelmed and will have episodes where I do not say anything to him but I will write him notes so he knows why.  \n\nSo, yeah, the family I was raised with is not affected that much whereas the family I gained is affected.", "i am so isolated and im scared i am going to go crazy i started homeschool which was a horrible decision. it is not like i talked to a single soul when i was in regular school but there were people around me. all they did was make me anxious though. thinking about going back to that school makes me want to cry. \n\ni have not done any of my homeschool work, any of it. i cannot concentrate at all. it is been like 2 months of no work.\n\ni have nothing to look forward to in life. i cannot even get through highschool. i have not had a friend since like 5th grade but they were fake even back then.\n\ni talk to my family but that is it. i am actually suicidal but there is nothing nobody can do about it. my dad already told my psychiatrist and therapist and they did not have a reaction. my dad thinks i am just saying it to stress him out but what do i have to look forward to? nothing.\n\nmy days are all the same. i go to bed around 3-4 and wake around 12. i drink coffee then i shower. then i eat something unhealthy like mac and cheese, i have AFRID so my whole diet is bad. i then play animal crossing and maybe nap. my days are not eventful. i do not have a car or anything so it is not like i could really go anywhere.\n\ni know a mental hospital would make me worse, especially with my sm. i have no options. i have tried a million different meds and a million different therapists. i do everything they say. journaling, meditation, working out, but i hate it. meditation and working out make me feel gross. have you tried making online friends? even if you cannot talk to them in person, just texting them or voice chatting with them can make all the difference. i know how you feel, i am in a similar situation.\n\ni started online school a few years ago and since then, i have completely isolated myself. have not interacted with anybody my age for years, not even my few friends from my old school. sometimes i feel like going back would be good for me, but i also feel like i am too far gone already yknow? and i am also struggling a ton with my schoolwork. i have completely lost my focus and it SUCKS. \n\nand yeah, i feel you 100%. like what IS there to look forward to? i have no friends besides my two online ones and making any is out of the question, i cannot get a job, i cannot function in society properly because of my SM and anxiety. also yeah, life is just so repetitive and bland. i stay up until 6am, sleep until 3pm, try to do school stuff but fail, waste time on my phone, listen to music and play guitar, eat, maybe sleep some more, repeat. it is always the same. every. day. \n\nsorry for talking so much about me, i just want you to know that you are not alone and we are in this together. and i do not know how, but we will make it \ud83d\udc95 Sorry about that man. But at the same time it is nice to know that I am not alone in going through the same stuff. I do not know many people with SM that are going to be able to do voice chatting, but otherwise, I agree. Your life is yours, no one else\u2019s. Who you are is not defined by who you know, or do not know. Make something to get up for. Create a goal and work to get there. You can manage in a society without lots of verbal communication, though not common, it is doable. Depression is common, and medications do not help everyone. Some days feel terrible yes, but you are the only one who can change this. Making the decision to change when you find yourself as described takes strength! I hope you find a goal to motivate you. I had a hard time communicating in high school and dropped out. Ten years later I am an online student which is hard, but at least I am in the comfort of my home and making a goal happen. What do you want to be like a year from now? Five? Each day has baby steps, but a direction and goals really has helped me. I still have days I crawl back to bed, but they are not as common because I want more for myself. I hope you find strength and set goals. Just getting your room clean and laundry done are accomplishments! Reading a book, taking a walk outside, and even volunteering at the animal shelter to walk a dog are meaningful. Bigger goals like a job seem more doable when you work up to it through smaller accomplishments. Good luck, life is hard, but rewarding when you accomplish goals you set for yourself. oh true, sorry my head was somewhere else when i wrote that comment ahaha I hope you find your way. I hope you can find your project or purpose or whatever it is that gets you excited. That helps. Knowing why to get out of bed every day, and believing it in your heart. I hope you find that. It is out there. Stay strong and keep looking. You are here, reaching out, so you are already on the right path. You can do this. Yeah I am going through a similar thing. I have left school and I cannot get a job. I do not have any life goals and I have lost touch with all my old friends. I do not know if it is any help but one of the things I do when I am suicidal is try to think of something that I want to do. Just something small like a new tv show I want to watch or a hair colour I want to try, just something to keep me alive a little longer and give me a chance to think of more long-term goals and plans.\n\nOr at the very least, it gives me time to go back into my own little world and ignore reality. Maybe not the best coping mechanism but it is the best I have got right now.", "If you ever need someone to talk to... I just want to say I am 28 years old and I had sm as a kid up to about 24 years old. Sometimes it was hard for me and actually tell is to talk to family members even. I also have autism and learning disability which made my sm come on and made it harder when I had it...\n\nNow I can pretty much for the most part talk to anyone, anywhere...\n\nSo if you need any advice or someone to talk to or text or even if you just want someone to play games with online(I could use a good family feud partner theses days...)\nThen just dm me or reply here\n\nHope your all doing good! How did you recover? I would be up for it. I have some questions about sm and how to improve. Not sure how to dm either Sure I think being calmer and having less anxiety made me feel safe enough to talk again. Like I had other anxiety about other things and when that got better I also felt I could talk more \n\nAlso feeling more better about myself helped a lot It is a little hard to know if my advice will help everyone here because I am different then most people with sm. I was not born with it is what I mean. I got it from being learning disability. But a doctor said it was sm \n\nBut anyway what is the same is I still was scared to talk like you guys here just maybe for a different reasons You do not know me, but do you think it is plausible for me to be talk to everyone if I move across the country. I currently only talk to the people I live with and I feel that the only thing holding me back are the people here who are familiar with my no-talking. I think you can do it honestly. Even if its just a little at first late comment, but I did see a video of a girl with SM who changed schools and made incredible strides with talking. \n\nI can relate with how it is harder when people expect you *not* to talk. You have to go all-out and have determination to just do it, not overthink it. I did this when I started college and there was much improvement, though I am still far from totally recovered. How much do you talk now compared to before? I was able to talk 90% of the time when teachers called on me, doing group work, and I even successfully gave half a dozen presentations. I still do not talk much unprompted and do not raise my hand, and I did not really make friends.\n\nThe pandemic might actually mess things up for me, though, because I feel like I need consistent practice and now everything is online. if you have the resources for that, moving across the country, or even just to another nearby city, or even another school will help tremendously. When you are stuck in a place where people label you as someone who does not talk, the path of least-anxiety is to just stay in that role. Trying to break out of that role will be terribly anxiety provoking. When you have moved and you are in a place where nobody knows that you do not speak, the path of least-anxiety switches to just talking like normal. Not talking at all would cause the most anxiety in that situation. \n\nEven anecdotally, many people with sm whom I have gotten to know over the years have mentioned that moving to a different school was the impetus for their start to a normal life. In my own life, both moving to a new city and starting college helped a lot.", "This  I just stare at them. Then when they break silence, \u201cWhy are you so talkative and loud?\u201d", "How late is too late to treat SM? I have been reading that selective mutism is usually diagnosed and treated as a child, I hate self diagnosing but my family and I all think that I have it but I am 18 now. I plan on bringing it up to my psychiatrist but I am worried that it may be too late to properly treat and that I may have also developed avoidant personality disorder as a result. I have not been able to find much about adult treatment for sm, only children. I do not expect treatment to be easy or for many things to be reversible bur I do not want to live like this for my whole life. I feel like I have gotten so used to it that it is just part of my personality at this point.  I do not know but I too would like an answer as I have the same problem but for 2x as long.\n\nI bet they have not done any long studies and I suspect that it can be overcome, period. But that is just my opinion.   I just wish I knew sooner, it sucks that there are people who were just never diagnosed because people thought that they would grow out of the behavior as a child. I do not know when my next appointment was scheduled for but I can try to remember to get back to you with anything she says regarding treatment if you want Thank you, that would be really nice. Thanks. Do not forget. a million thanks.\n\nAnd you are right, I wish it had been handled as a kid for myself as well. Its really impacted my ability to work. If I did not have it I am pretty sure I would have a job I mean.  I hope that she tells me something that will possibly work for both of us, really just anyone with this who did not have it handled at the right time. It sucks so much. I hope one day you will be able to start working and start to overcome it, I think you can do it.\nI feel like I would have had a totally different school experience if it was handled when it should have and would probably have a job by now. I hope something can be done about it still because the profession I want to go into has so much human contact and apparently people just pour out their life stories to you too  I am in the same position as you are. Do you have a discord?  I do not have a discord, I have other things though  Never to late to treat SM. We went to the SMart Center outside of Philadelphia when I was 17. Www.selectivemutismcenter.org you have to go in-person first for intensive but then follow up remotely if you live far away. I think they also might be able to do initial by web but I am not sure  You would only have to go in person once or multiple times? I am from New York so it is a few hours away and I am not sure how often I would be able to go back after the first time Only once. Then you can follow up with web conferencing  Just once. Then you can follow up with web conferences  Do you remember how expensive it was? I think 3k? They do not insurance but if you have out of network coverage, there could be a shot. I think we got it. Plus they offer financial aid if you qualify. What are your symptoms? What would out of network coverage be and what would even make someone qualify?\nWhen I was younger I had almost all of the symptoms I have read. I still have a really hard time speaking in public places and I can barely talk in the class I go to for cosmetology even though it is my second year. A lot of times the words get \u201cstuck\u201d and I can almost never make eye contact and when I do I have to look away. I always try to get out of speaking in front of people and I have had to leave the room because I would either start to cry or actually cry. I usually avoid social situations in general because I get really overwhelmed and I have been told and I know myself that I am a completely different person when I am at home or at a friends house who I am comfortable with and get told that I never smile and always look very uncomfortable, I usually am to an extent though. I do not want to waste your time by going on and on though but you can message me if you want. I am supposed to be seeing my psychiatrist I think next month and plan on bringing it up because I would rather have a professional tell me what is up than my family and I just thinking I do. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety so I am not 100% sure if maybe it is just really bad social anxiety or if it is something else too.  What did she say? I have not had my appointment yet since I go I think every three months? It is either scheduled for later this month or early February but I have to check. Hopefully she knows something about it that will help even a tiny bit Any information would be great! Good luck to both of us finding help I saw her yesterday, when I brought it up she mentioned putting me on Prozac but I told her I do not want to be on more meds. I go back on March 3rd though so she will hopefully give me more information then. I will let you know what she says though It is never too late to treat selective mutism.  Well, this is an old thread, but I will bite. I was never diagnosed, but had all the symptoms from early childhood until after I was 18 (In my 30's now). I literally could not speak in some environments at all when I was still 18. I had no mental health interventions because my family did not care and going to see a professional about it was too terrifying for me to do alone. I basically was close to avoidant personality disorder as well.\n\nWhen I was 19, I stumbled upon a book about Tibetan Buddhism that explained how to cultivate loving kindness/compassion. I spent about a year meditating every day and journaling to remind myself to view the world compassionately. \n\nThat basically fixed my most severe issues. Since then, I have never been completely mute at least and can force myself to talk. Now it is closer to just social anxiety, which still blows, but being able to speak when I really need/want to is liberating. \n\nThere are actual quite a few studies on loving kindness meditation now and there is evidence that it is effective as an intervention for anxiety and many other mental health issues so it is not just me. :)\n\nBest wishes. Thank you, I will try to look into that because when I mentioned it to my doctor she suggested putting me on Prozac which I did not agree to because I want to eventually be off meds I am 35 and i discovered just a month ago that i had sm since i was a kid. It ruined my childhood and leaved a strong scar into me, but i somewhat managed to get better after my twenties, even if I cannot talk to strangers at all or with my family and friends about personal things and feelings. \nNow that i know what is the enemy i hope the \"battle\" will be at least fair if not easier.   It is been 5 months, and I hope you found help by now.\n\nIt is not too late for treatment, but it will probably be an uphill battle because it has gone on so long. It is also difficult to find a practice that really understands the condition or has treated many people past childhood.\n\nThat being said, I think you had said you lived in New York. I have an adult child with SM and after two years of searching, we finally found this practice: \nThey were recently highlighted in a BBC documentary and have been helpful for us.\n\nI wish you luck! I have not really found any help at all, my psychiatrist tried putting me on Prozac but that is it. I do not want any more meds so I did not allow it. I did not even realize it is been this long. I will try to look into that page in the morning, it is very late here, or early depending on how you look at it. Thank you I am hoping that knowing what it is will make things easier for me too. I hope things get easier for you  I believe you can do it! Feel free to write me if you want, I discovered that writing helps a lot. Send me a PM and I will give you my email address. Best wishes man,  I mean it", "I do not get their logic  I wish I knew ASL. I learned a few letters as a child but then immediately forgot all of it. I think its interesting that you bring it up; I am in college right now and took an elective in cultural anthropology, and in their open-source texts they briefly touch on the cultural identities associated with using sign languages. Here is a ( if you are curious. To get to the right section, ctrl + f and search for 'deaf culture' or 'ASL'. It will take you to the section I am talking about.\n\nI think what may have happened in the situation you are describing is a conflation between deafness as a physical state and the Deaf culture that folks typically experience when they learn to sign. As in, someone may be familiar with the culture and also think you must be deaf in order to experience it. The site I linked disputes this, of course.\n\nAs a side note, feel free to save that text if you are curious about cultural anthropology. Its completely free, and covers a variety of topics. I absolutely know where you are coming from. My 17yo is a SM, and finds even basic conversations with bank staff, doctors, etc, highly stressful. Even using writing to communicate is hard for them.\n\nBecause both my children are on the spectrum with adhd, we use both verbal and BSL communication. Especially when in public, or when both want to talk or need an answer at the same time, I use both verbal responses and BSL to carry on two conversations at once. It works for us, but almost freaked out my youngest's psych the first time I verbally communicated with her while also using BSL with my then 9yo.\n\nLike many families with people who are SM and/or on the spectrum, we have found that whatever means of communication that works for us is correct. I do not get why ability would be the only prerequisite to using a language anyways. Guys, I was reading Elon Musk.. the problem is we learn to quickly. We are too smart.

Everyone should learn and use sign language at least the basics. I know enough Finnish SL to get by, I have taught some to my friends so I am not completely fucked when I go mute trying to explain that I need to leave the class for a moment to a teacher, but others not knowing any and having to teach someone to be an interpreter because of anxiety and lack of guidance going on with getting any official assistance. I was so happy to find out one of my friends already knew fsl. I can only imagine how it can be for people who are more mute than me or have sl be their main or only form of communication. You are so brilliant! You have found a wonderful way of expression!\n\nI have never really gone into signing lyrics, apart from a few times dancing around the room with no one watching.\n\nYou are brilliant! I am going to be doing some sign as you want to the music with my 11yo, and see if my 17yo wants to join in.\n\nI am sorry if this makes me sound like a silly sort, but will you keep this *hug*  for a time when you want it? \n\nThere have been times when my 17yo just wanted to be left alone. I always put a piece of paper on her study table with the word 'hug' on it. You are the nicest person I have ever met on Reddit! Thank you for your kindness.

I have heard that selectively mute people only talk when they are comfortable and are physical unable to do so in circumstances where they are not.\n\nI might not understand SM very well. I do not think having a fear of physically speaking is the same, but I do not know.\n\nWhen ever I need to talk, especially for a presentation in front of people, even if it is just one person or we cannot see each other's face (like a phone call). If I have to talk to people I do not know, a group of people, or someome I am not comfortable speaking around I will just burst into tears. As embarrassing as it is to admit. I freeze up, put my head in my hands and I do not move and I stand/sit there crying unable to stop. \n\nIn truth I am terrified of sending this post too. But that is probably just a social anxiety thing. And I cannot go to a doctor to be diagnosed or ask questions, I am just not in a position where I can.\n\nI am not asking to be diagnosed here, I just want to know if actively fearing talking physically to people and SM are related? Or the same?\n\nI am sure this question is asked a lot but I just want a direct answer of some kind. \n\nAlso... Do you have to have been SM as a child to still be as an adult? That is just a thing on the side that I have been wondering for a while. It can be a spectrum. \n\nSM is a kind of anxiety disorder.\n\nYou do not have to be a child to have SM, but I think for a lot of people it starts during childhood.\n\n For me, especially when i was younger and pressured to speak in front of a class or group I would be forced to tears from anxiety or frustration, Frozen and unable to speak.\n\nIt does sound like you may have it to an extent. Selective Mutism is classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM-5. \r  \ni am diagnosed with both SM and social anxiety and honestly i am not exactly sure of the difference. \r  \n\r  \nso..personally i do not think of SM as a fear of speaking necessarily (as i do not think i really fear the act of physically speaking)..it is more like a situation makes me extremely anxious and one way my body reacts to that anxiety is that my throat tenses up to the point where i cannot speak (though i will say there are times i am able to really push through that). \r  \nso i guess i see my SM as a response to my social anxiety.\n\n\r  \nbut i would think if you fear talking to people and are then unable to do so, then it could be selective mutism..but if you fear talking to people and are still able to be verbal then i would say that could be more of a social anxiety thing.\r  \n\r  \ni think SM typically begins in childhood and it is often picked up on when a child goes to school..so that is where it is more commonly seen..i have seen people say they would developed it as a teenager as well..so i suppose it could start at any age. For me I have no drive to talk, but there are some situations where I do, but I cannot.", "Recovered, now reverting back? I have been experiencing depression and anxiety since I was a child (10 years old, I am now 26).

Long story short I have a lot going on right now and I am experiencing a lot of depression and anxiety. It has not been this bad in a long time. I can feel myself slowly going silent again.

Where you were okay for years and then it came back?\n\nFor clarification, I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have a lot of symptoms of adhd and autism and I do plan on seeing for a diagnosis as it is effecting my daily life and work.

It has a basis rooted in your anxiety and depression which as you know has been a life long struggle to keep at bay. Hang in there. You are not alone.", "I am a writer and I want to include an SM character in my next novel, how should I write them? (I have never used reddit before, so I apologize if this is not the right place for this)  \nI am writing a novel where one of the protagonists has selective mutism, and I have been doing research since last summer by reading articles and talking to some professionals, but I am still unsure I can properly write this character. I have never experienced or met anyone who is had selective mutism, and most of the information I have explains what selective mutism is from a professional point of view, but not what it is *really* like living with selective mutism.  \nI guess to be more specific, I want to know what it is like being an adult who is had selective mutism, or still has it. I would also like to know if there is anything crucial I should include (mannerisms, traits, information, etc.) and anything I should definitely avoid doing. Why do you want to do this? I think diversity in media is important. Growing up, I never felt represented in the things I read or saw (either because there were not any characters like me or because any that existed were stereotypical or inaccurate), and I know it is affected me now negatively; so I try to add characters who are different from me because maybe it will make someone happy. Or maybe someone will learn something from the character. But that only works if the representation is accurate, which is why I thought maybe coming here would help.  \nI also want to make sure this character does not come off as a token character because personally, that is always bothered me just as much as lack of representation. Hello - I am an adult (arguably) and here are some of my mannerisms: \n-never the first to initiate contact unless I *have* to be. I am good at working through anxiety so I look \u201cnormal\u201d but I actually hate reaching out. \n-nervous tics. Constantly fixing my clothes or hair. If someone calls me out on it once, I get fixated and try to never do it again. \n-obsessed with the way I smell. What if i accidentally offend someone for existing with my body and it is potential ... functions and odors?!\n-mostly it is a lot of overthinking until you cannot stop yourself from talking one day I had SM but I still have social anxiety. One thing is that I absolutely love hanging out with friends but I also hate it because I have the hardest time with conversations. I am vividly aware that I must talk to them (and I want to) but literally nothing is in my brain except my awareness that I must say something or else it will be awkward. Sometimes people will ask if I am okay because it looks like I am spacing but I am just  thinking too long on the fact that I have nothing to make conversation with. Another thing that happens with me is that I have no volume awareness when I speak. I do not know what my inside/outside voice is since I never had the chance to recognize it. Whenever I speak casually with friends or even for class presentations, someone usually needs to tell me I am too quiet or leans in to hear better. I immediately try to adjust and I have been slowly learning over time but I am still not there. I am really grateful that you shared this with me; it is honestly eye-opening, and I will try my best to be mindful of this while writing. Again, thank you so much for your response! Hi! Thank you so much for sharing this information, I did not know about a lot of this (especially the nervous tics), so I will definitely be sure to keep this answer in mind while writing! One thing to keep in mind is that the basis for sm (from my experience) is irrationally thinking that other people are superior and finding it extremely hard to internalize anything different\n\nAnd cause of that you get scared whenever you feel like youre going to do something that is going to make them think less of you I am still only 17, but when I was a young kid it was much worse (people had to answer for me all the time, I hardly spoke in school at all unless I was forced to, and when that happened I would feel like I was about to cry and not talk to anyone the rest of the day, and even struggled to speak to family a lot of the time) I think the most important thing to remember is it is often not people \u2018choosing when they want to speak or not\u2019 and it is sometimes literally not being able to speak even when you want to. With thinking about how it affects people when they get older, for me I think the main thing now is the constant anxiety of having to talk to people, even people I know really well I still have to plan whole conversations in my head before having them so I do not say anything wrong, even with really minor and everyday things like asking what is for dinner. For me I think a lot of that is to do with how people reacted to me not speaking a lot when they do not understand selective mutism and just think I am being rude, or when teachers force you to speak because they think it will help you. Sometimes with friends or in class or something I really want to answer or say something but either the words just do not come out, or I overthink it that much that I talk myself out of saying it By the way if you do end up writing this let me know or post about it here or something be cause it would be great to read! For me it is just as much physical as it is mental. Anxiety comes up first mentally and then it manifests physically and my throat closes up. If it is bad enough, it will trigger my panic disorder and just send me off into a completely frozen state. Only thought in my mind is, \u201cspeak, it is not that hard\u201d. I know it would obviously be immensely easier for the situation and for my life to be able to speak, but I cannot get myself to do it and idk why. I do try my best to make up for it with nonverbal communication (thank god for nonverbal communication) so I can communicate in writing or body language or hand movements and direction of eye contact and even the speed at which I do things. I think that should be included because it shows that there are options out there and you are not completely imprisoned in your own body. Hey, I am also a writer. I do not know if I can add anything to the SM side here, so I will share how some well-meaning people react when you never talk. They constantly tell you \"Hey, you are quiet/not very talkative.\" Or they tell other people \"He/she does not talk, so leave  them alone.\" Then, of course, there is the astonishment and spectacle when you do talk. \"Wow! They talked! I did not know they could!\" And they make it a game to try and get you to laugh, even though you just want to be angry and sullen. \n\nThis was basically my K-12 experience. To me, these behaviors were extremely annoying and infuriating. Not to mention getting surprised at me talking is part of the thing that perpetuated my SM. And again, I truly believe they meant well. They were nice people. But I could not help but hate them. It is taken a lot of reflection as an adult to deprogram that hate. As a kid, I never approached other kids to play. I generally never opened up to speak first. If I was required to speak in school or if someone asked me a question, I would answer just fine. But I did not really engage in small talk. I was comfortable showing my true personality at home and on the rare occasion when I met someone who seemed similar to me or was really friendly and non-judgmental. With everyone else, even if I wanted to talk, it was like I was trapped inside my body and unable to do what I wanted. I was too afraid of being judged for what I said, so I did not say anything. At the same time, I was frustrated with myself for not being able to function in a social setting like everyone else. I had no friends, and it was torture every time the teachers assigned a group project since I would always be left without a group, and the teacher would have to add me to one of the existing ones. It felt so humiliating. Even though the other kids were not mean to me, I always felt unwanted (this was a projection of my own feelings onto the world). \n\nI was normal at home and did not tell my parents about my problem. I was afraid they would be ashamed of me if they found out something was wrong with me, so I hid it as best I could. As a result I went undiagnosed and never knew what was wrong with me. I only found out about selective mutism in my late teens cuz someone in an online forum wrote that they had it.\n\nI am an adult now but I have recently found out that I speak in a very low volume. People always tell me to speak up. I know how I must sound to the world now because my cousin has SM too. Her voice is so low it is like 5 out of 100 bars in volume.\n\n\nI have lots of self-hate to deal with as a result of this problem. Thoughts like:\n\n- What is wrong with me?\n\n- I am broken \n\n- I am boring \n\n- I would rather be an actual mute, cuz then I would have an excuse/reason for being this way \n\nAll of these thoughts formed initially during childhood and continue to hold me back even though I am not as serious a case now Sorry for the late reply; I will definitely keep this in mind, and will make sure to make this clear in my writing and through the character. Thank you for the help! I think this is important too! This helps a lot since I was not sure if having sm also made nonverbal forms of communication difficult. I will make sure the character has a variety of ways to \"talk.\" Thank you so much for answering, and I will take note of all of this. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe I cannot thank you enough for sharing this. I never realized how much school kind of forces you to verbally communicate; I will definitely look through what I have written so far and reconsider the character's reactions to social situations, as well as their inner thoughts. This is wildly different from what I have studied (in the sense that actually learning about someone is experience differs so much from just reading symptoms and how they may affect someone is life) and I am really glad I came here. Again, thank you so much. Knowing thought processes is extremely helpful while writing, so I am really grateful you shared this information. I will definitely let you know when I finish it, I hope I do a good job! It is difficult when people do rude things without necessarily having ill intentions; this is definitely helpful, thank you. It is always been hard to find any people or fictional characters that I could really relate to. I am glad you are going to get some representation for us \ud83d\ude42.  Thanks for including SM in your story! It does vary from person to person the amount of nonverbal communication they are comfortable with. Along with the inability to speak, my body also freezes up when I am anxious and so the movements that I am able to do to communicate are very stiff and jerky. Also eye contact is a big big issue. It is like there is a line where I cannot look up past or lift my head past or it gets me to panic. Honestly sucks cause my neck hurts all the time and I cannot look at the board in school and I cannot look at the top of my computer screen. This really only applies out in public though. Not when I am alone. Sorry for blabbing, I just thought of it some more", "Where can I find help? I just recently found out that my problems speaking might be from selective mutism.  I am a 27m and have problems expressing myself (even typing this is stressful). I tried going to a therapist recently, but without being able to talk about what is going through my head it does not help any. Do any of you know a resource to help? I want to be able to form relationships outside of limited speaking to family.  Though you have expressed that even writing your thoughts is stressful, it seems you are capable of doing it. When you go to therapy, why not take with you a letter containing the things you want the therapist to know. I have found this to be somewhat effective. The more you work at it the better you will get. It is hard, you have to fight yourself, but you can do it! Have you looked into seeing a psychologist? I did residential treatment for social anxiety/selective mutism as a teenager at Rogers Memorial Hospital and do not have selective mutism anymore thanks to the work I did there. They have an adult program, too. The program is OCD focused, but I believe they accept anyone with a severe anxiety disorder. They accepted me.\n\nI imagine the idea of residential is difficult for anyone with social anxiety, but it seriously helped me and if it is something that interests you at all, I would encourage you to look into it.\n\nI imagine residential is not an option or neccessary for everyone, though. The work I did there was CBT-based. The real 'work' part of it all was going through my exposure hierarchy doing social anxiety exposures. It might also be an option to do this with a therapist or in an outpatient setting, depending on your ability and willingness to do a lot of work on your own.\n\nGood luck finding help.

I am so grateful for the job that I have now because I did not have to interview since I knew people...", "I think my fiance may have selective mutism and I want to know how I can help. Every time me and my significant other argue he completely shuts down and it becomes nearly impossible to finish our conversation. Afterwards he tells me he literally cannot speak. I can tell that he is trying it is just like he cannot get his voice out in a comprehensible way.  Sometimes it is just like little squeaks but mostly he says absolutely nothing. Usually it is when we are on the phone but when we are in person he basically just stares blankly at the floor and often he will not make eye contact with me. I can tell this is really frustrating for him and I think he just ends up making it worse by beating himself up for it. I want to help so bad but I cannot if I cannot even communicate with him. He tells me that it is because when his parents would yell at him (Which happened often) he basically just had to shut down like that or it would just get worse. What can I do so we can salvage our relationship and so I can make sure to ease his anxiety. If I am causing him distress I would love to minimize that as much as possible. How old is he? 18 So he is still very young. I do not know what works for him but in my case, I had to have therapy. And I needed to find a good therapist who worked with me. Basically, I automatically shut down whenever I did not want to speak. I had no control anymore. My therapist helped me to gain this control back. Now I can say \"I do not want to talk anymore\" but keep the ability to speak. I was 23 years years old when I finally beat this. It sounds like that is SM, but please encourage your'e fiance to get it diagnosed from a therapist (or psych if that is what is required by your state)  \n   \nI am currently 22 and trying to figure this out as well.  \nI think the first thing to do is talk about it. Yes, as ironic as it sounds.  \nonce you learn and understand the problem, it is easier to think of solutions, even if some might be temporary  \nI started teaching my mom ASL (American Sign Language) mostly words like Yes/No/Help  \nIt takes some time to learn but really fun and I think it will benefit you both if you try.  \nAlso if he will be interested in therapy it can help a lot, first you should definitely diagnose it, then for treatment I heard great things on CBT, and maybe it could help get good results.  \n\n\nYou can help him by:  \nWhen he gets mute (or gets close to it), ask yes/no questions to make it easier for you to communicate by simple body language.  \nthis also prevents more anxiety that can make him mute for longer.  \n    \nUnderstanding that this will probably be a long emotional process.\n\nI heard a few times it is common for people with SM to be creative/artistic   \nIf you think it might fit for him encourage him to do it more, just so he could express himself in mediums that are not speech.  \nYou can also try CBT with art if he will not spend time on it as a hobby but still likes art. He is definitely artistic. Thank you for your advice. I think therapy would be very helpful for him. You pointed out that this is something that happens while arguing, and that it was the only safe option for him as a child to deal with argumentative parents.\n\nHaving dealt with a similar situation, I completely understand how easy it is for him to shut down. I cannot guarantee that these things will work for him, but they help me so you could always ask/try and see if it will help him too.\n\n1. Conflicts feel like a war no matter how small. A safe space in war is bomb shelters and similarly my ability to effect the world around me diminishes and I retreat into my mind's \"bomb shelter\" where I just wait for the \"enemy\" to finish thier assault.  Some way about the way you are arguing is probably triggering his need to retreat in his mind's bomb shelter. I would try finding a new approach to conflict. \n\n2. Reassurance is helpful. I noticed in a different comment that he was 18, so he really has not seen any other way to deal with conflict. In the moment, gently remind him that you are not actually mad at him or disappointed or whatever. All you want is to notice the issue so you can help fix it and you would like/need his help figuring out what the issue is and/how to solve it. You are partners, but he may need reminded that his voice is important and you actually want to hear his side of things and what he thinks about the situation. Knowing his side of things will only help you grow closer, which is what you do with those you love. He may need shown what a happy relationship even looks like and be reminded that it is ok to just be happy.\n\n3. Happiness maybe be fleeting, but personal safety and a secure home should be constant (mostly since a fire other tragedy can spring at any time). He does not need to be happy about a situation, and it is ok that both of you are upset during an arguement, but he needs to still feel safe in the relationship. Each person has their own thing that makes them anxious in a relationship, so talk to him about his fears about what being your fiance means. Is he worried about missing out on certain experiences and getting cold feet in any way, or is he worried about being in an unhappy marriage so he just reverts to shutting down to subconsciously make you happy? It could be anything under the rainbow. For me, my dad cheated on my mom causing the divorce when I was young my was brother just/un born. My first serious bf, and 3rd serious bf both also cheated on me and I have serious trust issues with phones because they both cheated using theirs phones while sharing a bed with me.  I need my partner to be ok with me using and looking through thier phone at any time now. I need to be able to trust my partner on such a level, and for them to trust me.\n\n4. I need to feel valued in order to share my opinion and voice. That means when I do share my thoughts, I need to feel heard and respected. If my partner talks about getting in better shape, and then turns down my ideas to go hiking, swimming, and going one long walks with the dogs, eventually I am going to stop voicing my ideas because it is obvious none of them are good enough for the other person. At 25, I still struggle with trying to figure out who I actually am because my childhood was so repressed and my opinion was never important. \n\n5. It is actually easier for me to just go along with whatever the other person wants and pretend/learn to like it, than it is for me to decide what I actually want. In the end I realize I am unhappy and become resentful, but by then so much time has passed it becomes awkward. I need time to think about things, sometimes knowing everything possible and other times taking distance to forget and let my gut know for me. Too much pressure from my partner can make my decision making ability shut down, and my avoid conflict system start up. Pressure can take many forms too, so what may be pressuring to me may not be the same as others. But I am a very independent and passionate soul and so I need space and time to naturally make life's magic happen. I shut down instantly if I am yelled at or if someone raises thier voice in anger; deer in headlights, tears, hiding in the closet level of fear. My current partner sometimes will get frustrated with himself in the other room and these reactions will still trigger for me. Since I have been able to talk to him about it he has made it a point to immediately come find me if his anger slips out and hug me and reassure me and it makes me feel so much safer overall that he responds that way (the slips are rare and justified to begin with - such as him smacking his head on an open cabinet super hard).\n\n\nSorry for the walls of text for each \"point\". I was just trying to keep my ramblings a bit organized, lol. Hopefully they make sense. I have no idea what your relationship is actually like so I tried to just keep the advice general (or specific to my experience) for anyone to be able to use when trying to help someone falling mute to find thier voice again. Overall, when they feel safe talking, have them tell you what they can, listen to it as best you can, and try to avoid/do the certain things they mention in situations when they need the support. Go to counseling. Together. You need to learn to be patient with him. He may not change. You may never learn how bad the abuse was and chances are, he is not describing it that way. If you love him, YOU have to learn how to help him by being patient. The more pressure and insistence, no matter how loving, is making him take mental steps back", "Do you think your mutism extends to other things like facial expressions or body language? It just crossed my mind that these might be related. Yea!\nI am not sure if this counts, but I do not close my mouth fully. I just kind of have it half closed and put my tongue against my top teeth, and if I close it properly it feels weird and makes me anxious. I also do not show much emotion on my face.\nWith body language, I just usually look very tense, and I used to hold my arms up weirdly (which I still kind of do, but not as much). I used to hold my arms up like a dog\u2019s paws, but now I just bend them a little and always figit with something. I do not laugh in front of the most of people and hardly I make a face of anger. Also, when I get hurt, I try to solve it by myself, for example, one day I kind of fell and my knee started bleeding and I got soaked with my blood, but i did not tell anyone (although I am pretty sure someone realised it) and stayed calm the whole time. I think it does... Many people tell me I have a blank face and expressions. I definitely think it does. When my SM was at its worst i guess i did not express anything bc once i finally got comfortable enough to talk to people and show emotions, people were surprised enough to comment on it. \n\nWhich of course made me feel uncomfortable again \n\nWhen I am going into new situations i like to wear my leather biker jacket and sunglasses so it seems like my stoicism is a choice and not just me being super uncomfortable i know the two things you have stated are definitely the case for some people. for me, it extends to every vocalized sound so laughter, coughing, sneezing etc. i tried to do a chef's kiss in class today and realized it extended to making the \"mwah\" part of the kiss too For me, along with being unable to speak I cannot really move my body either, my head becomes locked in one position and I cannot fully lift my head to look at something, I am unable to move my arms properly, or stand up to get something. I struggle to sit in my seat comfortably and remain locked in one position, arms folded and hunched over forwards. This and selective mutism for me goes hand in hand. Everything feels unnatural, moving and speaking feels unnatural. yeah... Holy cow, now that you say it, so many things in my life just clicked. People still complain I am hard to read. Definitely. I use to never open my mouth when laughing. Just smiled and exhaled from nose. It is also difficult to look others in the eye so I look at the floor or behind them often which I am sure is common for most here it can, it certainly does for me. if i have to go mute it sometimes feels wrong to express myself in other ways like facial/body language too, but that might just be part of the stress/anxiety and be not knowing what to do with myself", "Does anybody else never treat their selective mutism? So, when I was 9 I stopped talking at school. A year later, I had a traumatic experience. Since then, my selective mutism became worse, as I would stop talking to the only friend I had, without any reason. I never got help, people at middle school just ignore me and I remember that a teacher told my parents that I should see a professional as my behaviour was not normal. Obviously, my parents ignore this and even threatened me with taking me to \"a hospital for crazy people\" if I do not stop being that way. Because of this, I grow up kind of terrified until I was old enough to understand that my parents were stupid. Of course, they know nothing about my childhood trauma. Now that I am an adult (19) I want to know about my childhood and discover why I was that way. I also have sweaty hands 24/7 and my doctor said that it could be related to an anxiety disorder, as I have many symptoms of it. I want to understand why I was silent for 8 years and why I still struggle with social settings. \n\nI feel like I am making assumptions but I want to read your experiences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I want to know if anyone here had the same experience as me and how you overcome that in adulthood? Sorry for my bad English. I would not talk to adults as a kid, with the exception of my parents and a few select individuals. (I guess my case was not as severe as most others I have read about.) I was taken to countless therapists and specialists growing up. I do not think any of them ever actually helped anything. What I needed was honestly to just do it. I changed schools in 8th grade and since nobody knew at the new school, I was safe from \"WOW look he is talking!\" So I started talking to the teachers at the new school. In the end, I was just tried of the selective mutism controlling me and I was given a good environment to regain control. \n Now I will not say I am cured because it does keep me from saying confrontational things or talking over people but at 25 I can lead a pretty normal life. One of the theories behind anxiety disorders like SM is that they are an extreme version of a useful trait. It is useful for kids to be somewhat shy from an evolutionary perspective. In pre-history, the kids who were not shy at all were more likely to wander off, get in trouble and never grow up to pass on their genes. Kids who were suspicious of strangers survived and passed on their genes. There is a classic developmental stage in toddlers around the time they start walking of becoming increasingly adverse to strangers, likely for the same reason.\n\nJust like many other traits, anxiousness exists on a spectrum. For some of us, we just naturally have a higher level of this trait, which unfortunately expresses itself as SM or social anxiety. \n\nIn this way SM is different from traumatic mutism, as SM does not have to have an event to trigger it. The distinction is important as treatments can differ based on whether someone has SM or traumatic mutism. same i would say changing environments and meeting new people is what helped me. I was not expected to act a certain way as much and it was not brought up around me as much as before. from there I just kind of grew out of it over time and am doing eh alright now. I would say my sm \"downgraded\" to general anxiety disorder. I have issues still here and there since I have never been properly treated or anything but it is not as extreme as my sm was. I was mute in school from preschool all the way through high school. Every teacher I ever had told my parents something is wrong with me and I need help but my mom would just say \"oh she talks fine at home\" and that was it. I was bullied a lot in school for not talking and really did not want to be alive. Eventually I got messaged by boys on Facebook and had some boyfriends in high school and that helped a bit because I at least had someone to talk to. I am still shit at talking to people these days especially in crowds and I am 28 now but it is a lot better. I wish my parents got me treatment when I was younger though I feel like my life would have been much better. I always felt something was broken in me. It seems like being diagnosed at an early age is very helpful. My parents were verbally and physically abusive towards me because of my selective mutism since I was 10. It they actually paid attention to why I was like that, my adulthood would not be so shitty. \nNow that I move for college, first day in I talked to people, even make friends! Honestly, there is no way I could change if it was not for this. I feel like a whole new person. My selective mutism went unnoticed throughout my childhood cause my parents were very naive about the whole thing. Over the years, several teachers sent letters home with me explaining how I was acting and my mother (she was mainly in control of my school stuff) got triggered everytime about how \"nobody liked how quiet I was\" and wrote notes back saying \"God made me this way and I am perfectly fine\". I grew up thinking nobody liked me (thanks mom, you are great for telling me that) and it definitely affected me during my junior high years. A school counselor got involved in 8th grade after one teacher told her about me. She often met up with me and my mother to figure out what was wrong with me. Like, I knew how I acted, I just did not understand why I was mute. I thought I was finally going to get some closure... nope, never happened.\n\nWhat I do not understand to this day is why the fuck my mom STILL did not think I had a serious problem even after a counselor got involved.. Years later after convincing my mom to get me homeschooled, I discovered I had selective mutism. Told her about it and she got triggered: \"You cannot just self-diagnose yourself!! A doctor has to diagnose you and your experiences have to be verified!\"... Are you fucking serious?\n\nAnyways, I got over SM myself after I started working. I knew I had to speak, so I sucked it up and fought through my anxiety. I cured myself and have minor social anxiety. I am pretty behind in life compared to my peers because SM and depression stopped me from unleashing my full potential, so I am still a work-in-progress. While I am able to chat with others, I consciously keep shutting up when I am with my parents. That is a mutual benefit because they are not really smart and I smell too much boomer-ism from them. We cannot understand each other, cracking a joke is too hard of a task because it falls on deaf ears.\n\nI think that they traumatized me to some extent. I start feeling anxious when they are around, even though I am an adult. I have never been able to speak easily to anyone even my friends. There is some people at school I really like and want to be friends with but I just cannot say anything to them even though they are really nice to me and I make it look like I do not like them. I am only 13 so I have not overcome SM yet but I really want to before I leave school No way that is exactly what I did. My parents would not listen to me or let me change schools during secondary school (high school in the US i think?), so once it was time for a levels/sixth form I changed schools because I could, and it worked like a dream. Obviously it was tough as hell suddenly speaking and being years behind other students, but at least I was talking.", "Only when threatened? PTSD I joined this sub bc I used to go mute in scary situations as a kid, and it went away for a while, but SM still happens when I feel threatened, and it is messing with my life.\n\nI can think of a few key events before age 8 that were traumatic and probably caused my SM. I am autistic, so that is a factor. But honestly, I had a scary screamy mother who made me feel anything I said was to be mocked or screeched into non-existence. When she was in a rage, I stopped talking.\n\nNow, there have been high stress moments when I really needed to say something to defend myself and I cannot. Not violence, tho sometimes that happens. Social scary moments like getting in trouble at work, or feeling called out in a group. Times when I needed to stand up for myself and could not. My mind went blank and I had no words in my mouth and my throat could not say them if I did.\n\nHas anyone had successful therapy for this? Have you learned how to work through it in an anxious moment? Or have a good coping skill? I am totally open to advice here. I really relate to this, when i was getting in trouble at school for things i never even did i couldnt defend myself so i would have to sit someone else\u2019s punishment. It really sucks and I am sorry you have to go through it. I feel like i will never be able to get a job interacting with the public when i go silent under pressure because it would make situations worse. But I have kind of gotten better at it on my own since some of the therapists i saw were that anxious situation that made me go quiet.", "I just applied to volunteer at a kitten rescue This is my first time volunteering. I will be there for 2 hours twice a week through the school holidays, and maybe a bit on the weekend if they need more help. I will have to talk to the owner of the rescue as well as other volunteers. I am both nervous and exited, this feels like a big step forwards. Just wanted to share that", "How can i give back? What can i do to give back? Should i perhaps compile a journal of my past recollections of living with SM that it might perhaps be used for data for a future researcher? Any ideas? Much love. Thanks.  The journal sounds really cool! You should do it I think it would be interesting.  Write a book and publish it. A couple of years ago I was seraching through the internet for literature on this and could literally only find a handful of books about it. I bought one self published book by someone with SM.", "Am I selective mutism? I am almost silent at school. I can speak normally at home, female classmates and art lesson. However, I cannot speak anything in front of male and whole class. \nI find that my voice cannot come out when teacher tell me that I have to share in front of the whole class. Also, sometimes I want to speak to my male classmates, my voice also being silent. \nSometimes I feel helpless because I want to let others know I want to speak but the voice just silent. I did not mean to ignore others talking. \nIt is happened after or even during my primary school.  I remember when I first study in my primary school, I can speak normally. However, in primary 4 to 6. Teachers and students become weird. Teachers always laugh at student's opinions. Remember once a teacher told us to write a journal of your favorite magic power. Then, I write invisibility. Next day, he told the class that someone wrote invisibility and said that it was naive. Although, he did not point out my name. I still feel sad about that. \nAlso, a teacher always told us to share something to her. Sometimes she called me. After the sharing, she got angry and scolded me that the sharing was not her matter. Whatever I share, she scolded me with the same reason, after she scolded me. My classmates started laughing at me. \nAfter I graduated from primary. I become silent. I am sorry this happened to you, what you describe does sound like selective mutism yes. The \"selective\" refers to the fact that it happens in certain situations (like school), and it does sometimes start after a traumatic experience.", "Camp for therapy? ( Intensive Group Treatment) Hi, my son has been diagnosed with selective mutism. He is 4.5 years old and will be entering pre-k in the fall. He has always been very shy around friends and extended family. His behaviors have grown increasingly worrisome to his dad and I, he started nursery school and does not speak there at all. We are having him evaluated for autism. We saw a therapist for a few weeks, she felt there was autism red flags but felt it was more anxiety/selective mutism. I am biased but he is so smart, sweet and wonderful. He talks plenty at home and is very advanced (he can fully read even though he has never gone to school). I am looking into this Intensive Group Treatments, week long camps that are supposed to be very successful. Has anyone gone? Any stories? Examples of the camps: ( \n\n( I can very strongly vouch for communicamp! I went 3 times as a younger teen. They coach the parents on how to help the kids and what to do, while they work with the kids and give them age appropriate tools. I went from being non-communicative to being fully verbal and confident with their help. It takes quite a bit time and a lot of work, so early intervention is really important. Since I was a teen it was much harder to recover. It is great that you are doing this now. your comment makes me tear up! i am so filled with hope, i just want to help my little guy! this place seems amazing but i did not want to get my hopes up. The smart center is really amazing! It is definitely worth it. Everyone there is so sweet and super great with the little guys. We went to courageous kids camp In Denver and it was great! All the kids were speaking by the first day. My son improved a lot and had a lot of fun. Thank you so much for your comments, that is great to hear", "I think I overreacted about something so stupid idk? My boyfriend is really understanding it is just that he was asking questions like would u talk to me always if we lived together for some reason it made me really uncomfortable and I tried to change the conversation by asking other questions or saying some other stuff but he asked if what he said was stupid so I asked what he meant and then I explained to him that idk and that at any moment I freeze and just words just get stuck in my throat and I cannot form them and I just felt really sorry that I do not call him too much and we are like dating for 5 months now and I just feel really bad and Im scared I might have a panic attack cause every time I have it my chest hurts pretty bad and I feel really sorry I lied that my tummy hurts to leave even tho he begged me to stay it is just I do not want to panic and do something stupid so I just feel bad I left him but I do not feel comfortable talking to him or anyone I think I am over reacting but idk I am just a little scared Whatever you are feeling is valid, perhaps an 'overreaction' but no doubt what you are feeling is more intense than ordinary shyness or insecurity. It may take more explanation to your boyfriend but he most likely is just concerned for you and maybe a bit insecure as to how you feel about him.\n\nYou can tell him these things though, that you freeze up and literally cannot talk sometimes, that you worry about having a panic attack, that this is not likely something that will ever completely go away. Write them to him if you feel up to that, it may be easier to communicate that way. \n\nWhile it may seem the best way to exit an anxious situation, lying about physical symptoms will be likely to foster distrust, or at least prevent the kind of deeper connection honesty would. It is no shame to have an anxiety disorder or any other kind of psychological issue, telling him that you worry about panicking in front of him and that this makes you want to leave despite how you enjoy spending time with him will be much more straightforward in the long run. If this aspect of your personality makes him too uncomfortable perhaps he is not as loving or understanding as you deserve", "How do I talk to people online? I really cannot talk to anyone irl so I try to online but it never works out. Sometimes people start convos with me on twitter or reddit but it just ends quickly. All I can contribute is simple stuff like \u201chey\u201d, \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d and \u201chow are you\u201d. I never have anything to actually bring to a conversation. \n\nI have been trying to use IMVU to talk to people but the people on there tend to be rude or strange. Most never talk and just stand there doing nothing. I used to talk to the odd person on /r/kikpals when I needed someone to talk to. Hope that helps :) they usually are looking for conversations too! If there is a game/book/movie/series, etc that you really like, try to find a subreddit or discord or whatever about that subject. If you do not know what to talk about, or do not want to talk about personal stuff, you can always talk about that subject, since everyone there will like that subject. And it is a great way to find online friends with the same interests as you. My daughter with SM uses the sketch app to talk to people online. Since she is an amazing artist, sketch has helped her a lot. It started with the likes, so then she would thank them. Now she has full on conversations. I had to make sure she doesnt give out personal info though (and I randomly check to make sure she is being safe). ", "A step-moms question... Hi friends, \nI am so glad to have found you all a year ago. You have helped our family immensely and now I have a bit of a burning question. \n\nMy stepson was diagnosed with selective mutism at the age of 4. He has progressed through things enormously well and has coping strategies he uses in particular scenarios. Recently, he has started to verbalize frustration and anger and grumpiness out loud in a way that we have never seen before! We are overjoyed to see the same reactions at home happening at school. We know it is a HUGE step! \n\nHowever, he is starting to snap and shut down when he has a hard time verbalizing what is going on, even at home. And it is starting to negatively affect his relationships with his classmates. \n\nI do not want to push him too much, but at the same time I am wondering what things you would have wished your parents would have done when you were experiencing those strong emotions.\n\nWhat kind of actions or words can I incorporate into my doing (as well as encourage the other adults in his life to do) to help him make sense of how he is feeling? \n\nAny insight you could offer would be appreciated! Thanks internet friends :) He is now 6 years old* First up, sorry for potential bad english, since it is my second language!\n\nI used to have tantrums myself, but only when I did not succeed at anything I was normally good at. I learned to control myself eventually, I only had them at home though. It helped me a lot that my mum put me in Therapy in Kindergarten and Elementary school, where I got let  some frustration out (For example we used to have little Sword fights with cushion-ish swords. You could hit pretty hard but it did not hurt). I never really did any sports, but that could perhaps be a solution to vent some frustration.\n\nI have read once that it is quite normal for Mutists to get fits of anger, it settled down for me after I have grown up and through therapy. Now that I am reflecting on it, it probably was because I used to have most of my tantrums when something did not go well in Video Games, which were a good outlet for me. It probably brought my insecurities to shine which I wanted to hide in beeing good at games.\n\nHard to say what you can do for him, since I really do not know him. It could be positive reinforcements, which always helped me (Be careful not to reinforce this behaviour though). \n\nIt could also be that you challenge him, that you know that he is capable of doing it (Be careful to not put too much pressure on him).\n\nOr showing how he can make it work in this certain situations? Pretty hard to say but hopefully I could help a little bit.\n\nIf I could not help you, I am sorry. Feel free to ask any further questions thuogh! I went through all of this at one point before and succesfull recovered! It took me almost two decades but working through it is key. (Could have been faster if I have been to more Therapy, we stopped in 2nd grade. I made the rest of the journey alone).\n\nHe will get better, it is only a matter of time. Just be there for him when he needs you. I am sure you are going to get through this together. Good Luck and keep us updated! Thank you so much for the update on your past 2 decades! This is great to hear. Thank you for the suggestions and tips. It sounds like he is getting angry when he cannot express himself.\n\nI think he needs some help from a speech and language therapist - they can help him find a tool that helps him to communicate what he wants to as well as a 6 year old could be expected to.\n\nThere are apps for phones that can be used, so perhaps that could be one portable solution for him whilst out playing.", "Is it possible I could be undiagnosed with selective mutism? I am not trying to self diagnose but I feel like there is something wrong with me and I am more than just shy.\n\nI can only really talk comfortably with one person outside my family. Anyone else I can barely talk to.\n\nI cannot start or take part in a conversation or ask for something I need. Even if there is something I want to say, I feel like my throat has closed up and I cannot get a word out, it is really frustrating.\n\nWhen someone asks me a question or talks to me, I panic. Usually I shrug or nod or shake my head but if I have to speak my words come out jumbled and I can only answer with a word or two. It is okay to self diagnose if you think you have a problem. That way whether or not you do, you can learn to cope with the similar issues that you face. To me it does sound like it, but I also cannot diagnose you. It would be a good idea to see a doctor that you are comfortable with if you have one. I understand that it is not easy to tell them. Sometimes when I go to the doctor I write down everything I want to mention so I have a list to tell them and answers to possible questions.", "my partner just disappears Hey you all, thanks in advance for your insights. \nMy partner seems to get these shut downs and completely stop talking under stress. It seems to happen when they feel any intense emotion good or bad. It happens when I invite them to meet my family. It happens when I am sad about some thing in my life. It happens when their life changes. It happens when I express intense feelings of affection. I will be full on sobbing, begging for a response (over phone) and get total silence. In person I get snuggled but no words. I tell them I love them all the time and get no verbal response. Not even once have I heard those words. I get hugs and kisses but no words. when we have a conflict they stop talking to me altogether and it seems as if they completely vanish into thin air. \nThey are a very kind person and I believe they are honest and care about me. They say they disappear bc of anxiety and its out if their control. It seems odd to me that typing out some words in a text could be a challenge, or that if your partner invites you to dinner you will be unable to get out of bed for 3 days. It took me a while to stop assuming the worst. I am still really having a hard time not taking it personally or getting upset. I want to understand and support them but it hurts me so much. \nIt is also preventing our relationship from progressing. They have not met my friends or family and I have not met theirs after over three years. We only see each other a few times a month because the rest of the time they are avoiding the world. I believe they may be suffering from autism and possibly selective mutism. however, part of me wonders if I am just being a fool and letting them walk all over me. \nDoes this scenario fit in with a common selective mutism story? Is it possible for them to be truly UNABLE to communicate with me? \nIf so, what do I do to help them? Thank you in advance. I do not text my parents more than a select few words in response, and until the last 3ish years I did not say 'I love you' to them, and I still do not at random. I used to say it all day long, but one day I stopped because I thought it was weird.\n\nMy family is my biggest problem when it comes to talking and today is the day I am taking to change that in a more productive way. Thank you for sharing. I love the idea that they might consider me family. If they pressure you to socialize does it make it worse? Maybe the people we care about the most can also be the most triggering. Sounds like the best thing I can do for both of us is continue trying not to take it personally. :/ In my eyes just treat them as normally as possible. It is hard for me to even give a straight answer there, if I am spotlighted to say hi to my uncle for example, I just cannot really do it. Though a lot of people tend to have the opposite of me, where they find it hard to talk to strangers, but can talk to their families normally. Which I would honestly prefer, but I do not understand the other side too well. In ways I do, but not entirely. That Is very interesting. So in theory they could very much want to do these things but be unable to. When they stop talking to me I think it means they do not love me. No matter how many times I am told it has nothing to do with me. Maybe I am just not the right partner. How can we be happy if their disability makes me feel deeply hurt and rejected. have you asked your fam if it hurts them? my partner says their family is used to them being who they are. I feel so terrible that I cannot adapt to it and it still hurts me\n\nedit to add: or maybe we are perfect for each other bc we offer the chance to grow and address deep wounds together \u2026 is what I keep telling myself. I really love them. I wish I could just chill when they vanish \n\nedit to add again: Thank you Well it does sound like she is that way, for me there is this girl I really fell for (although nothing past that, literally nothing).....but if I was with her, trust me it is for the right reasons. I am sure it could hurt my family, but at the same time that is never my intention. It is just mentally I cannot do those things, and I am trying to. A partner, specifically this girl is why I even want the push to change since a month ago.\n\nThough even though my goal to change is by 19, Idk where I will be then and in actuality my optimistic goal is in 2 days, the 31st....but that is probably not going to happen unless I start talking tonight, which maybe I will try? Idk....\n\nI also can not express to my family that a girl is something I would want to pursue (being 18), since I did sneak her number from my Mom's phone since she had the number....I cannot contact it unless they know. Plus I do not go out on my own, and until I know who I am I would be afraid too.\n\nOn the inside I feel like that confident and outgoing version of myself is there somewhere, it is just not here at the current moment. The change is scary to me, because you are committing to a 'new life,' you really know nothing about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso maybe you can meet with her family and discuss? Idk though, you would have to run that by her first. For me, I would have a problem introducing that girl to my family or bringing her to my house because I cannot be myself in front of my family and I cannot talk to them normally....another reason why I need to change, as I talk in hypotheticals.", "Making friends Hi. I am 11, and in 6th grade. I have not been in person since 3rd grade, and am having issues interacting with people. I cannot talk to teachers, and do not even feel confident enough to give them a note, cause I will feel stupid, or go home and think of a way I could have said it better. I am struggling to make any friends. I do not have confidence to be funny, or even laugh at something. My anxiety has been pulling me back, and I do not like talking to people anyways, so I am not sure if I am even sm anymore, or if I am just shy or have social anxiety. But I really want to make friends, but it feels impossible. Wow you seem quite smart for an 11 yr old. Anyways, what I did in school is just made friends with the other quiet kids who were just like you and me. You are not alone with these feelings, just give it time and try to stay confident. Good luck The biggest lie I told myself growing up with selective mutism is that I do not like people anyways. That is a complete lie and a copious amount of copium. Be honest with yourself first and foremost, and go from there. Selective mutism is a humbling experience, and when you learn to stop giving a fuck is when you learn to start living. things can get better! :)  I have had to find out the hard way that it is impossible to have a normal friendship while having sm.

So i walked away shamefully and pretended that I didnt hear them. \n\nBut that was my first run on VRchat I do think VRchat or any voice chat games / voice chat can possibly help.

I am a psychotherapist trainee and I am reaching out to you because I am looking for information about SM in relation to adults. I have been reading a lot about it to be able to support my adult clients better, but most SM research papers are about children/adolescents and there seems to be a gap in the research literature when it comes to SM and adults!   \nWhat I am trying to look for is information about what challenges come up for adults with SM. What kind of support do you feel you need? Have you had a positive therapist experience? what was helpful? or if you had a negative one, what went wrong? Are there ethical and legal challenges that have come up in relation to SM?\n\nSince there is a gap in the literature, there is no better place to ask than Reddit!", "Did I have selective mutism? So, I have been wondering this for a while now, from what I have read I have seen conflicting information. When I was around 13-16 around this time I was essentially selectively mute. By that I mean I did not respond to people aside from a yes or a no, there were moments when I could talk when I was in a moment of genuine internal comfort then it would go away again. I was able to get out of it, probably due to having less distress tho it pops up once in a while where I cannot speak due to distress or start to find it difficult to speak when I am extremely distressed. \n\nGrowing up, my sister would speak for me, so I had difficulty knowing HOW to speak. During those three years it started because I genuinely had a sudden feeling of hatred towards humans and became extremely reclusive and dissociative. \n\nIdk, I do not know if what I experienced was selective mutism because from what I am hearing is it DOES NOT go away? Maybe my internal world changed since then and that is why I am able to speak now, though it is forced and was forced for a while developed from a robotic place to speak while I was not present. It does not sound like SM from what I know but I could be wrong. SM is caused by extreme anxiety, but it sounds like you did not want to talk to people (you said it started because you had a sudden hatred towards people). Usually SM starts at a younger age, too (but I am sure there are exceptions). \n\nLastly, people absolutely can overcome selective mutism. When I was younger my sister would speak for me and the only way for me to speak was through roleplaying, or that I knew how to speak. That was before I was 13, but it was not like selective mutism until then. I think I had unconscious anxiety and distress around others which started out toward my conscious mind as hatred or feelings of extreme exclusion and uncertainty then turned into forgetting how to speak, and only in few moments of lightness was I able to really speak. So kind of both. So I do not know, it could be it could not be what you say. It sounds like you could have had SM, but we are not psychologists, so we cannot diagnose who does or does not. But try reading the Wikipedia page: \n\nThere is some good info there, such as this:\n\nSelective mutism is by definition characterized by the following:\n\nConsistent failure to speak in specific social situations (in which there is an expectation for speaking, e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.\n\nThe disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication.\n\nThe duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of school).\n\nThe failure to speak is not due to a lack of knowledge of the spoken language required in the social situation.\n\nThe disturbance is not better accounted for by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively in people with autism spectrum disorders or psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. I do not think SM is necessarily caused by social anxiety, just in most cases. It definitely was in my case, of course, so I do not understand the details. But Wikipedia days it often accompanies SAD, implying that it is not always. And this site  says \"More than 90% of children with Selective Mutism also have social phobia or social anxiety.\" \n\nIt would be interesting to see what SM is like for that 10%.  It could be quite different. I had selective mutism growing up and now I just have social anxiety. A lot of times, selective mutism is just the discussion way a mental disorder presents itself. Also lots of people who have social anxiety as a kid and are treated for it, \"grow out of it\" fairly quickly. Idk much about selective mutism that is not social anxiety related, and I am not an expert on it either, but I would not rule it out just because it went away. If it is important to you to know and you have the resources, you can try talking to a mental health professional, specifically one that is familiar with SM (since it is pretty rare, many MHPs have never even heard of SM). That would be interesting to see. It is hard for me to imagine what that would look like. I would also be curious to know if that 90% is children who experience social anxiety, or have been diagnosed with SAD.", "i have selective mutism but always yell at people under stress and confortation idk if anyone can help me with this but.. usually im silent. and i am very aware that im the problem in every situation but when people get mad at or specifically yell at me my body will act to its own accord and just yell and be really mean to them.. i know im the problem but i will run back to my room and just cry and say things like \"why does everyone hate me so much?\" \"why are you such an asshole?\" when its obviously me. they had reasons to yell at me. I suck. I just cannot control being confronted by the truth or being yelled at by my family anymore. but why? I deserve it, why cannot I just take the blame for once? everybody hates me cause of this and since im so audible there they never understand why i am silent to my therapist and the public. im sucha bitch.  I guess I cannot come to hear it and confirm that it is reality.. idek if I should post it on this subreddit or not.. i am at fault and they have a right to be mad at me. yet my body just screams and screams and insults them. I mean.. they deserve it too but so do I so why must I be such a hypocrite? why cannot i shut up and take the verbal abuse I deserve?   \nis there any answers? or am i srysly just a bitch. i normally cannot speak, but when they speak to me aggressively I just cannot help but be so angry at them for being mean to me..", "I wonder if there are lurkers here who struggle with communicating online. I remember when I first began talking to people online, it was incredibly nerve-wracking, almost as bad as in-person. \n\nShoutout to the OG Club Penguin users\u2014I used to be one shy penguin when I was 7/8. \n\nThen I started using forums when I was 12/13, and I was *so* nervous to ever post. I would mostly just lurk, even though I really wanted to interact with the regulars.\n\nEventually, it is gotten better through habitual practice. ~look at me making a post!~ It is kind of hard for me. A lot of the time I will delete something before posting it, or I might delete it later. It is even harder with comments. So mostly, I just lurk. I still hate it. Sometimes. When I was younger I had no problems talking online, but only as long as people I could not talk to in person would not see. I was super active online when I was 13/14 and had a close internet friend (that I met in person a few years later but I ended up not being able to speak to him so we fell out). Then stuff happened and I stopped using social media. For the last 4-5 years I have been so scared to make posts or talk to anyone online.\n\nThis year that changed. I started opening social media accounts again. My hands were shaking the first time I started typing out a comment on someone is post a few months ago. I am still nervous to post and take forever to make sure all the words are perfect but it is getting easier! Online/text is actually worse for me than in person because it is so easy to overthink word choice/what I am saying/end up getting embarrassed and deleting the whole thing/never sending it in the first place. Knowing I can delete a comment/post and \u201cerase\u201d it is too tempting, I have to force myself to post something and then walk away from it. Yeah, it is not as bad as in person for me but I definetly find it hard to talk online sometimes. I re-read everything I post like 10 times over to make sure I do not come off wrong and that is even if I post. I do not usually end up talking a lot online either, especially in voice chats, I do not think I have actually ever joined a discord voice chat once and I have had discord for around 3 years. I am in like 15 discords and only talk occasionally in 2, although I seem to be talking more often in discords so that is nice. Yep.\nIt sucks because sometimes I actually enjoy conversating with people, but I struggle to do it in real life and online.\n\nAlthough it is less nerve-racking when I am online. In the past I used to have severe anxiousness when I subscribed to large group chats online. I did not know how to introduce myself effectively to all these strangers, I had to wait literal hours to make the first step, if I chose to made any yes. it is awful, like i want online friends bad but every single time someone responds, i ghost. the only way i can even post is if i am anonymous and even then it is a struggle and i usually end up deleting the post(s). Yep. I am active in Discord communities without actually being there and talking to people. When I comment things, if I actually do, I never look back at them and refuse to read the related notifications in fear of people\u2019s responses. Also, yes, playing online social games, like Club Penguin, without actually socializing was my favorite childhood activity Not reading any other comments or I wont reply. Usually do not participate cuz icant get down all I want to say, or my mind wanders, or I stress over grammar and spelling and all. I am not even spell checking this now. It all builds up before usually I even get to typing and I just bail. Not worth the effort to sort it all and then worry whether anyone wants to read my interpretation of all this jumbled bullshit anyway.", "Making calls for doctors appointments I had been putting off calling to schedule a doctor's appointment because of COVID. Now, things have been back open for months and I still cannot make myself call. I get panicked and go mute every time I try. So now I am month overdue to make this appointment and I am almost out of refills on my meds so I really cannot keep putting it off.\n\nI feel like COVID made my SM worse because I did not have to face any of the things that triggered it for a whole year. Now I am getting out and trying to do stuff the SM is an absolute nightmare, along with my social anxiety as a whole being less manageable.\n\nDoes anyone else have any tricks they use to make phone calls less daunting? Maybe write a script for your phone call and recite it when you call? That way you are starting off just reading instead of trying to come up with words on the fly. Write out a script. Exactly what you want to say. Include your name for sure and what days/times you have free. They will most likely accept one of those times or possibly offer another similar one. Do not worry about sounding anxious or robotic reading this out, they are a receptionist doing their job, they are being paid to serve you as a client. Take advantage of that fact, that is what they are there for. Perhaps prepare some answers to questions they might ask, like the nature of your appointment or whatever else you can possibly imagine. Do not be ashamed if they ask you to repeat yourself, again you are calling for a practical purpose and their job is to serve your practical need. These sorts of deliberate steps should help immensely in accomplishing your goal, and I guarantee you will feel good afterwards for having accomplished it. I will add to the comments about writing a script, I have written a few scripts with my speech therapist for everyday scenarios like that and it is really helped me. If you are worried about freezing up and not being able to speak clearly, knowing that you have already proven to yourself you can say the exact thing you want to (or at least close to it) can make it easier. Also, when I have to do something like this it helps me to remember that speaking \u201cwell\u201d is something I can work on and learn to do for myself separately from my responsibilities (if that makes sense). When it comes to setting up appointments, the only thing that matters is saying enough words so you can get through the phone call. So if you are still pretty uncomfortable afterwards, do not beat yourself up about how you might have sounded, you will have done all you needed to do, and the rest of it can get easier in time. i am also in favor of writing a script..or a lot of times i just write down points i would want to mention. then i read it a few times before making the call.   \ni also keep a pen and paper handy in case the person tells me something i would want to remember so i can jot it down. \n\ni would worked with my therapist on making appointments over the phone and he would told me that the hardest part is the moments leading up to the call..and that once the person start asking questions, i would fall into the script. he said it is not like i will decide in the middle of the conversation that i need to hang up..and i did not believe him..until i made my first call.  \nthe most uncomfortable part for me is when i hit call and am waiting for the other person to answer..and i find being on hold to be difficult..but once i am actually talking to the other person, my anxiety comes down a little..and then when the call ends, it is like a sense of relief. Oh my goodness. Why did not I ever think about this? I am definitely going to have to try that. After reading everyone is comments I am definitely going to have to try a script. Maybe practice it a but before calling. Once I am on the phone I can normally push through. I am definitely not eloquent but I can fumble through at least. Having the script does seem like a good way to help get up the courage to face it. I always get in my head that I will freeze up and they will think I am not actually me or something lol.\nIt is such a relief to see other people have this and have figured out ways to deal with it.", "For anyone needing a smile. Hope this is allowed ", "I am so boring I try to talk to people online but I cannot even do that. I cannot contribute to a conversation. I just tried talking to someone but they lead the convo and said \u201cwow you are like the most bland person ever\u201d. I do not even have a point in living. People online are assess. I would not take anything personal that a stranger says.  Do not take to heart that rude person's comment. With some people you will feel more at ease and it will click, and with others you will not be on the same wave length (like here). He does not even know you but he feels entitled to tell you that. You are a human being not his personal entertainer.  People are rude in real life and all people are rude on the internet. Ditch the rude ones and keep the keepers :) I am impressed someone admitted it to you... nobody ever bothers to tell me the truth. I know, though. Of course. It is hard not to know.\n\nSame situation for me. I hope it will be over soon. you are not boring. nobody is boring. but you might come off like that because of SM. if you can break through it and reveal your true self.  That is not something you would take as a true assessment. You know yourself better than anyone else. So when someone else says something about you that you know you are not, you should then  see that the problem actually lies in the person, not you. \n\nFor me, sometimes it depends on the person I am talking to. If I am talking to some popular frat dude or arrogant, high-class person, they will probably call me a boring loser. But if I am talking to a lowly intellectual, they will see me as thoughtful and chill. I know who I am, and I also know that I have had very genuine, meaningful encounters with people. I will not let some moron ruin that potential by making a snide and rude remark! :) I hope what I said helps. If you are sad, I am sad. We are sad together. :( Are you having a better day op? I have been thinking about you.", "Could I possibly have SM? So, all of my life I have not been able to talk to people that are not people im close to like my family, or classmates. As a child, I was so talkative towards my family about my interests, but when it came to school, I barely talked to anyone besides my small group of friends, and I was felt like it was hard to talk to people, and I felt like I could not really say anything, and I still do feel that way. I feel like it is gotten very worse though. I feel like I cannot talk to people who are not my mom, or sister since I have become much more distant from my family. When I am faced with a stranger or person I do not know, I just freeze up, and cannot get any thing out and we just sit in silence. But when I talked to my sister a few moments later, I could talk just fine, but I talk in a whisper most of the time now a days for whatever reason that I still do not know yet.\nI have been to therapy and my therapist and mom both agreed that I have selective mutism, but I did not stay in therapy long enough to get some kind of diagnosis besides depression and anxiety since I was very tired of leaving my house due to my depression. \nI have always not been able to talk in class, and I do stutter as well, but that is not really the main focus since i cannot talk to people in general and I just go very nonverbal when I try to say things to people I am not comfortable with including classmates I have known for years and have had classes with. I prefer to text things most of the time. \nThe thing is that...I do not talk much at home either. I just like to be quiet and I am just a huge ball of silence at home and in public along with my freezing up, and being nonverbal around others.\nI have been so confused about this for years now, and my life has been a struggle for as long as I remember. \nEven when I am forced to talk, I can only say one or two words and that is it.

Not even to me. I cant even explain it to anybody because, I dont even have the answer for it. Maybe because with strangers, they do not know you as \u201cthe person who never talks,\u201d so you know they will never draw attention to you when you do speak, making it easier to talk to them? Sometimes it also helps that you will never see them again. Generally, people know to avoid personal subjects when talking to strangers. OTOH, my family keeps bringing up subjects I would rather not talk about. That is a big one for me.\n\nAlso, strangers you will probably never talk to again are \"low risk\": It is not a big deal if you screw up and make the cashier hate you forever.

Perhaps also ask if it is possible to have x amount of session alone with the therapist", "Eleven Years as a Non-talker Today is a good day to write my autobiography here. For the past 13 years, I have had the freedom to say what I want to say when I want to say it, and I try to appreciate that every day. This is mainly for parents whose children are struggling to talk, but I hope it will also be uplifting to teenagers and adults who are struggling. This is what it feels like to be unable to speak.\n\nI do not know when it started, but kindergarten was the definite beginning of it being a problem. I did not say a single word at school from kindergarten until high school. In kindergarten it was not a major problem. I did not want to talk and was able to maintain friendships despite being a non-talker. Bathroom breaks were scheduled regularly, and I was not unhappy. Around 1st grade, it became apparent to the teachers that I had a problem. I was sent to therapy at school, which did not help. \n\nAs I got older it became increasingly difficult to function, both logistically and emotionally. I could not raise my hand and ask to use the restroom or ask to go to the clinic if I was sick. I could not order food from the lunchline, so I had to bring my own lunch every day. In 3rd grade, the teacher tried to bribe me into speaking, saying that there would be a party if I would start talking. This ruse did not work of course. My circle of friends began to thin out, and I felt near-constant anxiety at school. \n\nIn 4th grade, I was sent to a therapy session with some of my classmates who were deemed to be in my circle of friends. We played a board game, and they seemed to have a good time. Then when we returned to class we were told that we would have extra homework because we missed the class. My \"friends\" said they would not have wanted to go to the therapy session if they had known this in advance. I realized at that point that my circle of friends had shrunk to a dot: me. I spent recess alone and was not invited to sleepovers. I felt isolated.\n\nBy this time, I wanted to talk. It seemed I had a dug a hole so deep that it was impossible to get out. How could I just start talking, when nobody has heard my voice for so many years? It seemed an insurmountable task. I feared the reaction of my classmates. On the other hand, I reprimanded myself frequently. After all, all I had to do was start talking. My problem seemed so trivial and I felt so alone and embarrassed. In public settings outside of school, where I was able to talk, I feared that one of my classmates might happen to be there without me seeing them and would hear me talking. That would be the end of me. I had to maintain constant vigilance of everybody around me. The only place I felt safe was at home.\n\nIn 4th grade there was an oral presentation assignment. Of course I refused to do a presentation. It was decided that my parents should film my presentation at home. I refused until I felt I had no choice, and read my script as quietly as possible. I was later told that the video had been shown to the teachers and they were surprised to see me talking. When I received this news it felt as though I would be unable to continue functioning. I had worked so hard to maintain a distinction between those who can hear me talk and those who cannot, and now everything had collapsed. I lost trust in my parents for putting me through that, leading to further isolation. I think it is cruel to videotape kids at home and share the video without their consent, especially now that we have YouTube and the like.\n\nThough I did not think it could get worse, I turned out to be wrong. In middle school I had several teachers. Each new class brought with it fresh trepidation. I dreaded the roll call and the long silence that followed when my name was called and I did not answer. There was often confusion and awkwardness when the teacher attempted to converse with me. I was sent to therapists and psychologists outside of school as well. I was bribed with gifts of all sorts. After all the years, talking at school became a physical impossibility. One day I was injured on the basketball court and was bleeding substantially, yet I did not say a word.\n\nAs high school approached, I thought maybe just maybe there is a chance I can make a fresh start. I was ready to start talking, in the right circumstances (i.e., with brand-new classmates). I had gone to Catholic middle school and knew most of my classmates would be going to the Catholic high school. I asked my parents if I could go to the public school, which would be full of new people. It was decided I would continue at the Catholic school. Regardless, I resolved to make a change. On the first day of my freshman year, I summoned the courage to say \"here\" when my name was called at my first class. This elicited gasps, quiet exclamations of astonishment, and raised eyebrows from my classmates who knew of my condition. I felt petrified, as though I could pass out. I wanted to melt into the ground. I was not able to say another word that year. \n\nI was sent to the school therapist, who was not friendly. She had me fill out a questionnaire, asking about my emotional state. I lied on every question, and she apparently was not fooled. She accused me of lying and had me fill it out again. The results were sent to my parents, who until this point had essentially ignored my problem. The results apparently said I was severely depressed and wanted to die. My mom confronted me about it angrily and said she did not know what to do with me. I was ashamed and felt like a complete failure. This was the lowest point of my life.\n\nThe following year I summoned the courage again on my first day, was met with the same response of gasps and astonishment, and was not able to say another word that year. I started to fear the future: potential inability to be employed, increased burden on my parents for having no financial independence, loneliness forever. I was 16, and I decided not to go back to high school. Fortunately, there was a university in the city where I grew up. I started college, riding my bike there. I worried about not being able to talk, after all the years of silence, though fortunately I had no trouble. I made a few friends even. The \"fresh start\" had worked, and I felt liberated.\n\nIn my senior year of college, when I was 20, I enrolled in a French class to fulfill the foreign-language requirement. On my first day I realized that one of my former classmates from high school, who knew of my speaking troubles, was in that class as well. I experienced some anxiety but was able to speak. Surprisingly, he did not gasp when I spoke. I realized that it was because nobody else knew about me. If he had gasped, he would have looked like the crazy one, not me.\n\nI went on to graduate school, even giving presentations at conferences. I am entirely independent financially, and it might seem as though I have been \"cured\" completely, though this is far from true. I feel like I have accomplished a lot being able to overcome it, but at the same time I feel that I could have been much better if I had not been a non-talker for those eleven years. I still have the blank expression, rigid stance, and near-constant anxiety around people. I find it hard to initiate a conversation, and my trouble being personable at job interviews has undoubtedly cost me some good opportunities. I have trouble sleeping and have regular nightmares with a recurrent theme: my classmates have heard me talk. The worst part? I am depressed. It was certainly obvious to me in high school, but for the past 13 years I have been ignoring it. It is difficult to start going to a therapist when you went to them involuntarily for so many years, but I believe it has helped being able to talk about my past, hopefully without being judged. I am making progress healing from this.\n\nTo sum up, if you or your child is struggling with this, consider looking for a way to make a fresh start. If I had had the opportunity to go to a new school in 4th grade, I believe I would have been able to overcome it. The extra years of being silent have undoubtedly contributed the negative effects that I am still trying to overcome, as a 30 year old. If a fresh start is not possible at this point in your life, I hope this story will help you to stay positive that it will get it better at some point in the future. I am living the best years of my life right now. you got the courage to say here surrounded by people knowing you do not talk?? how!! I am not sure where the courage came from. When that happened it felt like it was not even a conscious decision. I was so nervous that it did not even feel like me saying it, like I was hearing somebody else talking. But at that point I really wanted to start talking. It was my first day of my first year of high school, so I thought that the other students would be preoccupied with the newness of the school, etc., and not care that I had suddenly begun talking (wrong of course). Also, there were new students who were unaware of my condition at that point, and I was hoping to be friends with some of them. None of that materialized. \n\nEating lunch by myself in high school was the worst. In elementary and middle school there were long picnic tables, so I did not actually eat alone, even if the other kids were not right next to me. In high school, the tables were small, so I was entirely alone. Every once in a while a group of students would feel pity and sit next to me. It never lasted, because they could not communicate with me aside from yes or no questions. Furthermore, the embarrassment was enough for me to not want anybody to sit next to me or talk to me, as I knew it was just out of pity. I am sure I looked very unfriendly.\n\nI hope that now the resources at schools are better for students having trouble with this. It makes me sad to think that there are kids going through what I had to go through. I have been through and am still going through everything in your comment above me. It is really horrible that there are more people than just me that have to go through this. Although, in a way, I am glad that it is not just me. In the future, I really want to help people that face these problems, or just help the people that others see as too different or do not see at all.\n\nI do not know who I would be without this disorder. It is become my identity. In a video that someone who overcame selective mutism made, they say that it tortured them to go to school everyday with some amazing people. Potential friends. Potential best friends. But they were never able to speak to them for that to happen. I also had no idea that there were other people who have gone through such a painful childhood, until I started searching online about a year ago. Its rarity makes it especially isolating. In my case, I never met another kid in school who could not talk. If you would like to help others, maybe consider putting your story on here, so other people know they are not alone. \n\nI feel the same way about missing out on friendships. For a long time I regretted that I wasted my childhood, but now I know that it is not something I could have prevented. We still have the future, so I am trying to be optimistic. I have made about three good friends since I started trying to socialize. It is difficult when you have trouble looking somebody in the eye and appear awkward or even rude. But the people who can see past those superficial things are the people who I am interested in befriending. Having a fresh start helped me as well.I totally get what you mean.", "Reconnecting with adult brother who has selective mutism I have a brother who is two years younger and has selective mutism. We were very close when we were children and would play all the time together. But once I grew up and became a teenager I stopped hanging out with him and was more interested in other activities and social groups. It was around this time he started showing signs of selective mutism.\n\nOver the years we grew apart. He started hanging out with our youngest brother more as I left the house to go to college and moved to the other side of the country (California).\n\nWe are now adults (I am 25 and he is 23). He lives with our single mother and youngest brother who will soon leave for college. Unfortunately he has discipline issues and often disobeys our mother and bothers her to the point of tears (spilling food, calling her names, and sometimes but rarely a forceful push). It has gotten worse and I feel like he is doing this out of a need for attention since our youngest brother has stopped hanging out with him and has socially moved on. \n\nWell we have not talked in a while, but I do I call my mother often and every time he runs to her room and tries to listen into the conversation. I sort of feel he wants to be included and maybe he would like to participate in my conversation, but can only do it with my mother present (she is practically the only one he talks to now). \n\nI would love to build a relationship with my brother to be on speaking terms again. For starters I was thinking we could play some video games again. It was his favorite activity. I would like to engage in something that allows more conversation. He loves Star Wars and it is one of the few topics I can actually get him to talk with me about. Unfortunately I have lost touch with the series. He also likes to read sci-fi.\n\nI would love any input on how to approach this! I know I may not have the same relationship as when we are children, but I do love him and feel responsible for letting our relationship drift away. It would also make our mom really happy to see us connecting again. This sounds like more than just selective mutism to me. Is this just his personality or is there a bigger diagnosis? I cannot speak for others, but I tended to stay away from everyone (even family) and do my own thing at home. Selectively mute people like anyone can grow out differently. But maybe he needs an activity or a hobby. Has he held a job before or attended any school past high school? Maybe he would enjoy an Xbox or a usual therapist. I had a similar drifting away with my sister when we were teens. I did not make friends and she did and seemed to change a lot, whereas I just stayed the same. We became close again after high school, though, after she was done with her teenage phase. I guess I skipped that phase.\n\nI think connecting on a common interest or activity is a really good idea! If you have lost touch with Star Wars, maybe ask him to watch one of the films with you or ask him to explain some part of it you have forgotten. \n\nHas your brother ever been assessed for autism? Sorry if I am way off, just wondering because I am autistic and I see some things that seem like they could be autistic traits. Well, you mentioned games and Star Wars. Maybe you could play Battlefront 2 with him and try voice chat. You might have to do most of the talking initially. You could also read a Star Wars book from your local library (or buy one). I do not think your brother is going to meet you halfway, so you are going to have to take the initiative.", "Chronically Ill and Selectively Mute Wondering if there are any others who struggle between lasting illness and mutism. \n\nFor an exorbitant amount of time I was unable to express the extent of my illness to family and doctors, leading to it only being discovered after I had physically deteriorated significantly. Even now, though I am recovering from SM, I struggle fairly consistently to inform the people around me of declines in my physical state. \n\nLately I have been looking at developing wordless (such as hand signals) or short verbal codes to express myself to my mother, primarily for when episodes are particularly bad and I cannot speak. Curious if there are others who deal with similar situations. I know how you feel. I have a few health issues and have spent a lot of time in hospitals. It is really frustrating because you cannot explain what is going on to the doctor. \n\nWhat I usually do is explain exactly what is going on to my mom beforehand, and she relays the information to the doctor. \n\nAre you able to text your family? Another thing you could do is send a text to your family explaining the situation, and they could talk to the doctor for you. Thank you, I was concerned I would get not replies.\n\nHm, I am able to do that, and have on occasion. The real problem lies where not only my voice becomes paralyzed, but my ability to think. Sometimes its one, sometimes the other, sometimes both. I can understand what is being said, communication just shuts down. I am uncertain if that is a strictly SM thing, though. I get this too. It is most likely caused by SM, as it can affect nonverbal communication as well.", "texting i have been sobbing for 15 minutes straight because it is too hard to text my grandma back. i have the text typed but i physically cannot hit send and the longer i stare at the screen, the harder the thought of sending it becomes (i initially typed it about a half hour ago). does anyone else struggle this bad with texting/messaging? I used to experience this everytime I had to write a text/comment/email. I have gotten better but there are still days that I will delete and retype the same message for over an hour and still never send it. Your definitely not alone in the struggle I have this problem with emailing. Honestly I just hand my computer or phone over to my roommates and they know to proof read and send it for me. I just cannot bring myself to do it. What do you think makes you not send it? Anxiety about their response? Uh i think it is a few things. Yeah, I am anxious that it will not be well received and I will harm my academic career. But, i am also very dyslexic and i have actually had bad experiences where other professionals look down on me for it (one of my professors straight up told me I did not belong in grad school bc of my dyslexia). Do you think there will ever come a time when you stop caring about other's thoughts of you? When you become jaded to others opinions? how did you make this post? Posting anonymously on an SM forum and texting to a family member impose different kinds of expectation. The whole nature of \"selective mutism\" is that anxiety is selective. Speaking to a close friend does not mean they are comfortable speakint to any other person. I struggle to message my mom back when my depression is bad, end up sending them at night when I know she is asleep. I texted a friend a month and half ago and she never responded, I think cause I crossed a boundary (revealed too much about my family life and it was awkward in hindsight). I felt bad so about two weeks later I texted again like \"what is up have not talked in ages\" and she still has not responded a month later. feels really bad man :( This. I had my first experience of selective mutism a couple days ago. I could not speak or do any kind of texting/typing to anyone when it first hit. I was able to use ASL but I do not know anyone but my virtual teacher who also knows ASL. Maybe that is why that form of communication was not blocked for me. It was not actually useful. After several long hours I was able to text to my husband and best friend but no one else. At one point in the evening no one was in the room with me and I managed to whisper a sentence to myself but when my husband walked in I could not manage to speak to him. Things were back to normal yesterday morning and now I have been trying to find out more about selective mutism. I have learned that it is a response to severe anxiety and it is possible to be able to communicate with some people but not others. There is no conscious way to decide who you can and cannot communicate with.", "Being SM in Quarantine I am nervous even typing this so bear with me. So sorry if it is long..\nI was diagnosed with selective mutism, I also have high functioning autism, and yes I have been going to therapy and taking meds to help.\nMy social situation is one really close friend at school, who has way more friends than me. I have known them since elementary with family relationships. I was not really \u2018close close\u2019 with their friends. \nEver since quarantine, I have been feeling so lonely, watching my family chat with at least someone real. By that I mean, all I have is rp on discord but i do not know anyone for real. And some of the servers on there have toxic desperate atmospheres that I do not want a part of 24/7. \nId chat with my one friend but I really do not know how to keep conversations going with them. \nI have my family, that is real, but my mom and dad are busy or napping, younger sister busy watching grey anatomy in her room all day, older brothers Both doing their own young adult things. And I have no one close to outside my family yet everyone does. My mom tells me to stalk random people from school on Instagram but I obviously do not want to have a panic attack in quarantine. And no one becomes buddy buddy like that anymore. \nAnd all this, I do not feel like my family can get what I mean. When I try to explain they misunderstand and try to jump in without listening to the end.\n\nBasically I want to know if anyone is in a similar boat, or if there is any activity you like to do at home, to cope with being socially alone. I have tried roblox, my switch, cleaning. Begged my family to play video games, have played a few board games\n(And yes I have been off my meds, because I usually take them for school and with my routine broken I have missed out on it for weeks, which could be partly why, Idk) I have not contacted anyone outside besides a friend every few weeks or so. I feel you, and I do not know what I would do without my family. I know it is difficult to express what you need, but I think you articulated it well here. Try writing a message to your family, and have them read the whole thing through so they understand.  \nNow is a great time to pick up a new hobby. I started baking, which is both time-consuming and satisfying, and I plan to take a coding class. Try picking up some solo activities, like reading and writing, and possibly some physical ones to keep your mood up. It is also good to go outside. You can try asking your family members if they want to go on a walk, or play a game or something if you have a backyard. I know my friends like memes, so I have been scrolling through reddit and youtube for memes and sending like 16 of them in our group chat every day. That stirs up some nice friendly conversation between us. I have never been great at talking to people, or making friends. The friends I have are the ones I made in high school or ones those friends introduced me to, and I graduated in 2012. I could never make friends in college, dispite being able to work up the courage to talk to a few people. So dispite being surrounded by people my own age, I have felt desperately alone most my life. My best friend's birthday was on April 30th, and I could not even work up the ability to send a Happy Birthday text since we have not talked in at least 6 months. And a year ago I was the officiant for her wedding (it was tiny, they just signed papers at thier house with thier favorite neighbor family as witnesses). My grandmother wanted me to video call her this weekend and asked via text, but it was too stressful so I ignored the text completely, and still have not responded...\n\nQuarantine makes me so much happier, tbh. I have been trying to get better at making and taking phone calls in particular, but any social situation is extremely stressful for me. So now that everyone else is just as afraid to approach me as I am to approach them, it makes things much less stressful. Since I have so few friends to begin with, hardly anyone is trying to get my attention, and I feel like I can finally breath again for the first time in decades. Still, I have my issues. My fiance had 2 of our friends come over yesterday, one was his best friend since childhood. I have never really known how to talk to him, so I always just let him direct any conversation and then I tend to sit out of the way, or do something else so they could just visit together. Our other friend who came by later to play some games is easier to chat with, but I still find myself mostly just listening and making noise here and there. \"Oh ya, I get that.\" Or \"that is crazy, who do they think they are\". Very rarely do I actually have a small story I can share to contribute. When I drove our friend home (it was dark and my fiance has bad eyes) he was talking about driving, and I got the chance to share a story about a car wreck I witnessed that freaked me out, and he shared a similar story. It was a nice drive. \n\nSorry for the long response, I tend to just unload in text since I find it so hard to talk in person. Often I will delete them before sending, but I am also trying to just accept all of myself, and if long texting is part of that then I guess that is where I start. I actually feel happier with the quarantine, tbh. I feel like it is a natural filter for all the extra social noise I have trouble shifting through normally. It is made it easier to realize what I need to feel safe, calm, and it has made it easier to see the things that are most difficult on me. I have always hated big parties, and school dances, and I have always had a general dislike for most people (love animals though), so I am realizing even more now during quarantine how much I can appreciate my few friends without worrying about the extra people.\n\n It also helps know the source of my SM, and I use the anger I have for that source as my fuel to speak when I desperately need to. The abuser that caused my SM does not get to keep deciding how my voice is used, so when I am afraid to speak I bubble up my pot of hatred and try to boil the words out. Saying something is better than nothing. When I stay silent, it feels like my abuser wins, and I just cannot let that asshole have his way anymore (I am No contact, but still)\n\nMy words and opinions matter. YOUR words and opinions matter. When we stay silent and let injustices occur to us, or around us, we are letting abusers get away with being evil and cruel. Abusers do not even deserve thier own life, so their words and opinions are the ones that do not matter. It is thier violent voice that should be the one muted. You are a strong, kind hearted person, and you deserve the chance to spread your beauty to others. This may have gotten a bit extra long, but I hope it helps. \n\nTDLR: You is Kind, You is Smart, You is important. Do not let others try and tell you who you are or what you like. The quarantine can be a great time for self-reflection, deciding what makes you truly happy, and then embracing yourself. I get bored with games and shows, but thinking of how I can feel happier and stronger, then doing whatever I can towards that helps. I kept thinking more friends would make me happy, but really it is appreciating the people and friends I like that has done me the most good. I make to at least remind those few how much I love them and care for them even though I have trouble staying in contact. My best friend will pick up right where we left off no matter how many months/years may pass (I am always worried she will not, but I trust her and she has not let me down yet so I have faith there). If making new friends is important to you, all you can do is put effort and energy towards that- they will not know you want to be friends if you do not say anything after all. When in doubt, I try to look at myself the way a stranger would, and if I want that stranger to be my friend, I try and act friendly towards them. In the end, every relationship is a 2way street, so if they are not up for it, or you do not contribute at some point, there will not be any relationship. Do what makes you happy, and if you decide to only need X number of friends, then that is ok. Your life is entirely yours, so live it doing things that make you happy and comfortable. I love science and art, so I will research and paint animals when I get the chance. Also, feel free to message me whenever if you are lonely or bored. I may not respond immediately, but if you can deal with text walls... lol. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your quarantine (lol, even my TDLR is long, I suck at short texts...) Thank you for all the helpful responses, sorry if I do not like to reply directly, it is just my personal preference.\nI let my parents read the post I wrote and they are going to try and help me better with what I need.\nFor now I have been trying to learn things that I have around me, like a solo game i never truly learned to play, YouTube tutorials, and just schoolwork.\nOnce again thank you for all your helpful comments it means a lot.\ud83d\udc9c", "Asking about a friend who also has selective mutism Hi!\n\nI am BlossomedApples! \n\nI have had selective mutism and social anxiety since I was about a tween, but it got much more pronounced when I got depression at 14 and since then it is been more of a struggle.  \n\nSince I was 4, I have known a guy around my age who has had them longer than I have and whom I have come to have a pretty complex relationship with over the years \u2014 he is been my friend, my crush, my enemy, my frenemy, my on-again-off-again bf, and my squish \u2014 and I now hope to go back to being friends again. \n\nI just sometimes wonder if, when, or how or if it is worth pursuing. \n\nAt one point I thought we would achieved it, but it turns out we had not fully and it seems like, for a while now, about 2 years, he does not really want me in his life anymore. His selective mutism got worse as he got older as well. For so long, I was one of the only ones he talked to or hung out with and was one of his closest friends, but now I am not. In turn, he does not seem to want to hang out with or talk to anyone anymore. He stays in his room most of the time, is very hesitant to come out, and prefers for there not to be company or to hear them interacting. I have tried texting, calling, emailing, writing, sending cards, sending birthday presents, sending voicemails, contacting his mom; I have tried pretty much every way I can to connect with him and he has not gotten back to me since. \n\nShould I keep waiting or trying? Should I do something different? Should I give up and move on? \n\nI would truly appreciate your advice and some uplifting words! :) \n\nThank you. :) Hey there! Wow that is quite the complex situation. To me it sounds like your friend might be going through something and feels the need to go through it alone. Even though that is not always a good thing, maybe he just feels the need to have his own space for a bit. It seems like you have tried just about everything so I have no other suggestions to connect with him lol. Your persistent efforts to keep connecting with your friend show that he is one worth waiting for, so I do not think you should give up. Maybe check in with him every once and awhile to make sure he is ok, but do not overwhelm him either. Just give him time, and I think he just might come around sometime soon. :) Possibly. Thanks. :)", "treatment in adults for sm?? so i am 20 and i recently learned about sm and i think i have it and have had it most of my life. my parents always just thought i was shy and never even considered pursuing any treatment. i am wondering what treatment for sm even looks like in adulthood and if its effective? \n\nidk ive heard a lot of it is treating the like cause of the sm, like trauma, but i honestly dont know what my \u201ccause\u201d is i dont have any like traumatic experiences or abuse or anything \n\nanother thing is i have social anxiety too and i guess it could be treating that but i feel like that wouldnt fix everything. i remember i briefly went to therapy for my social anxiety and i would talk to my therapist about situations where i dont talk to people and the therapist would want me to rlly think about why i dont talk and i had no answer. i would just say i was scared theyd judge me so we went with that and worked on addressing that but idk sometimes i do feel that everyone would judge what i say but other times i really genuinely want to talk but physically cant get any words out of my mouth ?? \n\nanyway i am super new here so any advice, resources, info is helpful!", "Is it possible to overcome SM without medication? I am 23F. I have had SM all my life but only recently found out there was a name for what I was suffering from. \n\nWhen I was between the ages of 18-20 I was on SSRI medications for depression. Effexor for 1 year then switched to Zoloft for the 2nd year. I did not know about SM then and now my depression makes more sense, but I stopped because I thought I did not need medication to make me happy. \n\nI am a lot better then how I used to be, but I do still suffer from extreme anxiety around others especially in school (which is hindering my ability to complete my education). I do not want to become dependent on a medication, however i do want to feel better and not suffer any longer. I cannot believe SM is a real thing. I thought I was the only one suffering from this and it feels good to know I am not alone. \n\nAnyways, is it possible to get better without medication? And if so, what can make me better? Definitely. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is the most commonly used treatment since it targets the underlying anxiety which causes it.  I am no doctor but I would imagine that using a medication along with CBT probably has the best results, but it is definitely not a requirement. Yes. Exposure therapy is the primary treatment for SM, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy. But exposure therapy (with baby steps) for SM has been proven to be effective in treatment for SM by research. As far as meds, note that meds alone cannot treat SM. Meds for SM are meant to be used *along* with therapy to aid you, but you do not necessarily have to take them to make progress.\n\nI would start by finding a psychologist who has experience with selective mutism, and can diagnose and treat you. Just please put a lot of thought and research into who you go to. I will warn you, psychologists that understand what SM truly is are rare. Most believe it is a voluntary choice and they approach it like a behavioral issue, which could not be farther from correct and will only cause regression. But with enough research, you should be able to find a psychologist that understands SM, or possibly even one that specializes in SM that is in your area. Yes, try different types of therapy. therapy does alot. You could try r/Nootropics. I personally do not view supplements as meds, though I can understand why other people may. Anyway, L-theanine helped rid me of passive anxiety symptoms which  makes it easier for me to...(brain fart occured)... begin and continue conversations instead of it going instantly blank Thank you! Yeah I do not view supplements as meds either, cannot wait to try some L-theanine and see how it works. Any brands you recommend? Also how much do you take? I use NOW vitamins 200mg. I normally just take 1 capsule in the morning with coffee because it works better if taken with caffeine. Im not sure if I can give good advice. But I have overcome my selective mutism. It affected me for about 7 years. And still feel insecure. Since i missed out on so many life experiences. I feel extremely left behind in social interactions.\nBut it is been a long and tough climb.And now i feel that I could speak whenever I need/want too.And that I can CHOOSE not to talk/respond.\nIm out of the mind prison.\n\nKnowing that all of these struggles are not exclusive to me was quite the discovery.\nTherapy made me realize that im not just a floating pair of eyes but rather a person that lives and breathes and talks.I hope that many people get to have that feeling as well.\n\nI wish you all the best.\nIt can be done. My brother has it and meds have not been working for him, so I think that it may be possible.

I am considering writing a survey to see what kinds of people actually visit this subreddit, since it is hard to get a picture just from posts and comments.\n\nWhat questions do you think should be asked? What do you want to ask?\n\nFor one, I would like to know how people find the subreddit, what their relation to SM is, typical demographic-type questions such as age/gender/location, and leave space for general feedback. Perhaps I would also ask what other subreddits people visit or what other SM communities they are a part of. Yea why not, i would answer it, why ask? I am asking for some ideas on what to ask.  A question asking what people with SM would like to be able to accomplish by next year (or see someone with SM do if they do not have it themselves) might be good. Setting goals is important for anxiety disorders and it could also give some insight into types of resources a lot of people might find helpful.  I think this is less suited for a survey and more for a discussion post. Maybe you could ask if people have been/are considering making a post and/or commenting on posts, or if they are just reading posts, and why? I feel like there is no particular *reason* people lurk, but I might include some questions about contribution. In general for any community 90% of the visitors are lurkers , 9% are commenters and 1% are content creators. Maybe there just are not enough people.\n\n Right, but considering this sub is about SM, there may be some people who would want to contribute, but do not because of their SM.

She is so brave omg I love her. What a shocking display of child abuse.

I recently discovered I was SM as a young child (thought I was and still am just shy) and omg I had no idea anyone else struggles with names. I feel embarrassed almost when saying names (film names, song names and peoples names etc) Just to add I have found repeating names in the mirror to myself has helped take the weight off it, since I know just \u2018forcing yourself\u2019 to say it does not usually work. Omg, I have the same problem. I thought I was the only one. Definitely even though I have recovered I find myself avoiding naming. Also remembering names but that might just be me. I feel this. I have been recovered for years now, but still have to make a special effort to use people's names. The fear of getting it wrong is still pretty big. Names feel important.\n\nIt is tough because the more you use someone is name the easier it is to remember and get right. But getting over those first few times is super hard. It is especially tough when there are lots of new people to learn. \n\nI try to pick one person at a time and work on saying their name more often, without checking. (I find checking a name more than one or two times increases the fear for me, rather than decreasing it.) Eventually I get comfortable with it and can start working on the next person. \n\nAlso, I try to remember that I do not really mind when people forget/mess up my name. (It is kind of unusual, so it happens a lot.) I think most people are the same. Most people have some degree of the 'oh no I am going to mess up their name' fear. So most people do not get mad when it happens to their name, I have found. omg dude yes why does saying names feel so embarrassing for no reason\ud83d\ude2d I do not have this problem when talking *about* people (except certain family members for some reason) most of the time unless the person is there and can hear it. But when I am talking *to* someone I do not ever call them by their name or anything, it just feels weird. With most people if I need to get their attention I either tap on their shoulder, hover nearby until they notice, or just say whatever I need to and hope they hear me. With my brother we both just say \"hey you\" to get each other's attention. We have been doing it since we were kids so it feels normal, but saying each other's names would be weird somehow. We also will just say Her instead of mom and Him instead of dad when talking to each other about our parents. Or Them if referring to both of them. Yea, you will get through this bro! and i had no idea too lmaooo :)) did not think of that and it seems like a good idea, thank you so much, ill try :)) congrats bro! :)) and yea i totally understand, its hard idk why :// yea, ur right, I will try and practice but yeah i mean even with myself i have some kind of difficulty speaking lmaoooo but thanks and btw congrats for recovering! :)) sammeeeeee i always was too scared to ask lmaoo :)) idkkkk i ask myself the same exact thinnggg :(( yeaaaaa you have got a point, I have always thought about that possibility lmao most of the time i also call the people by other ways that their name so guess it is also some kind of comfort zone to not say names :// I do have a serious problem with using names, other situations/topics I avoid are for some reason complements/saying positive things etc, I do not know why but I just cannot say them. There is more examples like that. I kind of feel like my SM became more situational rather than division based on people? Yea i totally understand that,  i feel the same way... ://", "i cannot find a therapist who will treat me. please help! I have 23 and have had selective mutism since I was about 5. My parents never took me to therapy or really did anything to try to help me (they thought I was just being stubborn and choosing not to talk) and so I still struggle with it a lot, though it is better than it was when I was a kid. I started going to therapy last year and it has been... difficult. I have seen three therapists so far, and they all ended up terminating because they think I need to see a specialist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut there is only one specialist in my entire state and not only can I not afford it, but there is a wait list that is nearly a year long. I have looked into some speech pathologists but they either do not know what SM is, or they only work with children.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am extremely frustrated, especially because SM is not my main reason for starting therapy. My reason for going to therapy is to try to learn how to cope with my chronic illness, which is an area that my current therapist specializes in. But because I cannot talk enough during sessions, she thinks I am better off seeing someone else. And I was JUST starting to get comfortable with her too!! Ugh. I am annoyed and do not really know what to do. If anyone is able to offer some advice or insight, it would be very much appreciated! What kind of therapist are they requesting you see first? Speech pathologist, it seems? \n\nDoes the most recent therapist you saw also have email where you can message her? Do you think that you might be able to talk more as you warm up to her? Yeah either a speech pathologist or an occupational therapist. \n\nWith my most recent therapist, I do feel like I will be able to talk more when I warm up to her.. but she is already set the date for our last session (June 24th) and now I do not know what to do. She first suggested looking for a specialist about 2 months ago, and is now saying that she hopes I can find someone else but she cannot continue seeing me because it is unethical when I can barely talk/she does not know much about treating SM. I am so tempted to write her an email and at least ask for a little more time to really get comfortable, but I do not know if that would be weird when we already have an end date set. Ugh the possibility of starting over with a new therapist is stressing me out so much :( I do believe that it is going to be difficult to treat with therapy when therapy is mostly done through talking. You can definitely say, \"Hey, I want to give you more information to see if you still want to set this as our end date. I personally would like more time with you to see how things go (on account of \\_\\_\\_), but I will respect your decision as the final decision.\" \n\nThis way, it is clear that she can make the best decision that she feels is right. Unfortunately, specialists are often not covered in many places. But selective mutism can be even more complicated, as the main treatment for it is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a type of talk therapy. It is difficult when the problems you have directly get in the way of the primary treatment for it. \n\nYou can try doing some exercises to build up your ability to talk to people. I do not know what situations are toughest for you, but if talking to people you do not know is an issue, maybe you can practice going into public discord servers and going into group chats with people. If you do something embarrassing, just leave the server and find another, or try again another day. \n\nI know a lot of my SM problems were based in anxiety. If this is the same for you, it can likely be treated somewhat similar to social anxiety. Exposure therapy could be somewhat effective, and if you can overcome parts of it on your own, you then have free-choice of therapists to help you out from there :) Can you speak through writing? Ie. Therapist asks you a question and you type the answer? I think all therapists should accommodate people to deliver help in whatever way possible. If you feel this therapist could provide you with help, possibly unrelated to SM, then she should work with you to provide that help. It is possible that over time, you will be able to speak part of the answer too! ", "SpiderMan Into the SpiderVerse ", "Do you guys have social media? I only use anonymous websites like reddit.

Through high school I had selective mutism in which I literally talked maybe 3 times in 3 years, it was a very hard time. Now I am in college and I was in a better place mentally so I could make a few friends, but this quarantine wrecked me, I just cannot reply people online. I have long-distance friend who is birthday was on June 2 and I could not send a message because I did not replied previously when she sent me happy birthday (I was nervous to reply and later I felt guilty for replying so late, so I did not) and the last case was a friend who sent me a message yesterday and I was too nervous to reply, so I only replied today (just because he called) and he told me it was an invitation to go the beach yesterday. I feel guilty to the point of having insomnia, I cannot sleep because I feel like I committed a crime or something, and I do not want to loose friends but the thought of replying makes me really REALLY anxious. I do not know how to explain, I want to reply but all the possible thoughts go through my head.

I.e if you cannot talk to person in general does it also effect you in text? Does not feel comfortable texting them at all and rather to just pass the answers to someone else so they pass it to them?", "Possible selective mutism? So I have never really had a lot of friends growing up, the max would be around 3 but 1 most of the time. I got bullied and made fun of quite a lot. I feel like this is a result of that. I have some friends with whom I can speak freely and openly but whenever we are joined by someone I do not know, my mouth stops moving. I want to talk but all I can do is give a forced chuckle whenever it is needed. I can respond with short answers whenever I am being adressed by them but that is it. But when I am alone and force myself into these situations I CAN speak. When it is with one person I am semi relaxed. With 2 people however, I shut down again. I get really red and stressed whenever strangers talk to me on the street. When I am buying something, even those few words that I have to say to be polite, are barely audible. Could this be selective mutism? Or just social anxiety. Selective Mutism is basically Social Anxiety maxed out on Steroids afaik.", "The Circle of Discomfort I feel uncomfortable saying that I am uncomfortable doing something. \n\nIn my music class we were told to video tape ourselves playing our music parts at home and then email the video to him instead of coming to class. The problem is I feel really uncomfortable being filmed/filming myself. I have always really not liked when people took pictures/videos of me and I never take pictures of myself either because to me it is just like scfgfnejwkdsgnbdvbnjhj. I did end up filming a video of me playing my part but I found it cringey and it made me feel sooooo uncomfortable that I deleted it right away. So now I do not have anything to send to my teacher and I feel really uncomfortable telling him that I feel really uncomfortable doing the assignment so I have not done that either. If he keeps  giving these type of assignments(which he might if our school shuts down because of the coronavirus) then my grade is going to plummet which sounds like a petty problem but it makes me sad because music is the one class that I was usually pretty confident in participating in.\n\nCan my \"camera shyness\" be related to my SM? Does anybody else feel this way???? What do I do now? just think about it like this: your teacher is the only one whos going to be watching your video and no one else is. plus hes getting videos of all of your classmates doing the same thing so it is not like you will stand out in a bad way at all (unless you try to). all you got to do it watch your own vid once to check if your form and stuff is correct (im assuming that is what the video is for) and send it and never have to watch it again. trust me, both you and him will forget about it in a day Sometimes you have to do things you do not like.\n\nDo not let small discomforts turn you into a hermit You could request that he deletes the video after he is assessed your performance. Your normal in-person performances would not normally be recorded, so there is no reason for this recording to persist beyond its intended purpose. This is basic privacy hygiene. I know it sucks, but I think it is related. I think you can be brave enough to say listen I have extreme anxiety about this and was hoping I could record myself off camera and send this to you. If you could explain that much, I cannot see why it would be a problem. Since SM is related with anxiety it seems like a pretty clear link. \n\nTry to nail down why exactly you are uncomfortable beyond the feeling of scfgfnejwkdsgnbdvbnjhj. Take a breath, maybe try writing it out. Basically, get your fear out of your head where it is powerful and into the world where you can see it for what it really is. I bet once you do this, you will feel better! \n\nYou already overcame the fear once in filming it! That is a huge step! You can do it!\n\nYour teacher is not doing this to make fun of you or to make you feel bad. And school is really a good place to try to push through these kinds of anxieties. Teachers really do want you to thrive. \n\nReally try to understand why you are feeling uncomfortable with the assignment and then you can start overcoming the fear. Do not let the anxiety win. \n\nBest of luck!", "What is it like having a younger sibling with a big age gap while living with SM? So my mum had another baby (it is her third) a few months ago (he just turn 8 months yesterday) and I am really worried about how my SM and other anxiety conditions could effect him growing up. It was difficult when he was first born (I ended up always whispering to people I could normally talk to when the baby was in the room, kept getting told to speak up despite being right next to the other person, it did not even feel that quiet to me so it felt like having to force myself to shout in normal conversations) but after working on it for a while it has gotten easier to talk around him now. I am currently trying to work on talking to him (or even just looking at him while talking to someone else), rather than just around him, and while I can do it sometimes it still feels extremely wrong while I am doing it. I am not sure if the fact he is a baby has any impact on it, I am sure he probably does not care or have much understanding about what I am actually saying yet, but it is still difficult for a socially inexperienced person who is not much good at leading a conversation to talk to a baby who does not talk back. At the same time, that could be making it easier, as it is less about saying the right thing (although it does still bother me) and more about just talking.\n\nI used to be able to talk to some of my cousins on my mums side, we did not see them all the time, but I guess it was often enough. I am not really sure at which point it changed or why, but it is really hard to talk to them now. It is really awkward when we see them because the older of the two (I think he is about 7 or 8 now) always tries to talk to me and he tends to hug people as a goodbye (which is really out of my comfort zone, although he does not do it to me as much now so I must come off awfully weird and unfriendly). He usually ends up asking his mum (his dad is not the best) why I wont talk to him every time and I always feel so bad about it, she always says something along the lines of \u201cShe does not want to and you cannot make people do things they do not want to.\u201d I am not sure if she actually knows about the SM and I get it is easier to explain it that way but to a child it must look like I hate him if I never \u201cwant\u201d to talk to him.\n\nI really do not want to end up being that person who tries to ignore their siblings existence because I am not comfortable around them, especially since I still live with them. It is difficult to explain to a child why someone cannot talk and I do still want to have a good relationship with them, rather than looking like I hate them.\n\nI have also read somewhere that it might be possible to learn anxiety traits in childhood from people your around often, I am not sure if it actually happens or how likely it is, but I would not want him to learn SM from me and end up with a similar lifestyle. I also have OCD and it is probably possible for him to learn compulsions as \u201cnormal\u201d behaviours even if he does not develop OCD himself.\n\nDoes anyone else here have any experience with with baby\u2019s/children? Have you been able to talk to them as they grow up? Does it get harder when they start talking themselves? Will it ever feel right to have them around? Did your conditions influence the baby\u2019s growth at all?", "Unable to speak in online lessons but fine in person Hope this makes sense, sorry if any of this information is unnecessary to the point, explaining SM issues is always a bit difficult and I did not want to miss any important bits.\n\nSo I am diagnosed with SM and it was more significant in primary school (could not speak to any adults). Since being at secondary school I have been able to speak 95% of the time with SM appearing a lot less. \n\nI am 17 and joined a new school this September (moved for sixth form an england thing), this school is aware of my SM as in its probably on the system but I think most of my teachers do not know as with new people I am able to speak now and sometimes I find if people know I have SM it makes it harder for me to speak. So i think it was only mentioned when we asked them about getting a diagnosis for ASD (have not got it yet) and we were telling them reasons we think I am autistic as they are sometimes connected.\n\nThis has been completely fine until online lessons this week when I was asked a question in 2 of my lessons (first time that is happened) and I just froze, I could not say anything. Now I am not sure the best way to approach this, if I say nothing to my teachers they will notice that I do not answer and might get annoyed. But if I tell them I do not think they will understand: I speak fine in lessons, answer the register for online lessons and I do not think I will be able to just type my answers into the chat as for me SM pretty much cuts of all my communication even non verbal. So it might come across as me trying to get out of having to do stuff in lessons.\n\nAfter a while I might get more comfortable with online lessons/ might be able to speak with some teachers or might find other ways that work, just at the moment I feel unable to.\n\nIf anyone knows how they would approach this or have any other ways of answering questions in online lessons that could be useful please let me know.\n\nThanks for reading this \ud83d\ude42 Can you do it without video? Can you respond through chat instead?\n\nIf it has not been discussed with your teacher I think you or your parent should just be like \u201cFYI, sm happening in this context\u201d and if you can figure out a solution to compensate and volunteer that would be best.\n\nAlso, can you video chat with other people or is it just with the teacher? Find a way to practice in the video setting. We do not use video for our lessons. We just go on a call and speak with mics. When not in lessons I sometimes go on a voice chat with my friends and I can speak fine with them Do you think it is because it is an authority figure or specifically the teacher? Maybe, when I used to have SM in primary school it was with adults so maybe its the different environment that brings back my SM. Only issue with logic that is I can answer the register and I think a couple months ago I was able to answer something but maybe it is not completely consistent. \nI think I will email my teachers and hope for the best, I am kind of panicking as I think they will think I am making this up and they will ask me questions even more but hopefully not", "English teacher asking for advice Hi everyone!\n\nI am a pretty new teacher so I do not have a ton of experience. I teach English at a vocational education in the Netherlands and starting today a new student will be joining one of my classes who has selective mutism. I am looking for advice on what I can do to be the best teacher I can be for them? \n\nI have to prepare them for their exams, two of which are speaking based. As far as I know, the school will not allow them to skip those. To prepare for the speaking exams, I let students do small assignments in class (like introducing themselves, having a chat about their weekend in groups of 2, play a game with the irregular verbs). \n\nThe class is pretty small, 8 students in total. The students, from what I have seen, have welcomed them with open arms. They are in general a very friendly class with a happy and positive atmosphere.\n\nI do not want to be insensitive so what can I do during my lessons? Should I let them know beforehand if we are doing speaking today? Should I ask them if they want/think they can participate? What do you wish your teachers would do/have done? Any other tips or advice you can give? \n\nThank you so much! In case you do not know much about selective mutism, here is a really good article about it - \n\nAs far as helping him, the best thing you could possibly do is not pressure him to speak. Pressuring someone with SM to speak/communicate in ways that they cannot only makes them much more anxious than they already are, which will make it even harder for them to speak/communicate. I would ask direct yes/no questions, and provide other means of communication, such as writing. Though SM does affect nonverbal communication as well so he may not be able to write either. And letting him know in advance if everyone will be speaking in class giving a presentation etc sounds like a really good idea. I always wished my teachers would do that for me. That way he can prepare himself and it does not have as much of an element of surprise, which will be helpful. Does your student not have an IEP or 504 with an accommodation exempts them from presentations? SM is a very debilitating and severe disorder which greatly inhibits school performance, so IEPs and 504s are pretty crucial for them. If he really has to do the presentation, you can try giving other ways he can present, like presenting 1 on 1 to you, or recording it at home and playing it to the class or just to you. I would ask the student (remember: yes/no questions) what they would feel more comfortable with, and/or talk to his parents. The worst possible thing for me was to sit there awkwardly while everyone else did a speaking activity. Or being paired with a partner who goes first and then expects you to reply. Maybe set up half the class at a speaking station and half at a quiet writing station. Talk to the student privately beforehand and tell them that it is ok for them to stay at the quiet writing area the whole time. That is going to take a lot of pressure off of them. So refreshing to see a teacher open to advice and learning a bit about SM! Thank you! I had some great teachers and I think that is key to overcoming SM. I think warning them ahead of time is great and allows them for preparation at home. I would recommend asking if they want to participate and how they want to participate privately. Anything that draws attention and singles them out will not be helpful. If working in groups I would find out ahead of time who they are MOST comfortable working with as that will be most likely to be a successful interaction. Other than that focus on building a trusting supportive relationship. If you are interested I just did a podcast episode about school and gave a lot of recommendations and talked about my awesome teachers. It is Outloud, The Selective Mutism Podcast. :) \n\n Here is an info document I made about SM for teachers. It has a good amount of information on it. \n\n ^(Hi, I am a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)\n\n**\n\n^^( ^^| ^^( ^^| ^^( ^^| ^^( ^^| ^^( This could be helpful\nWriting notes to the teacher helps me\nNot being pressured to speak\nIf something goes wrong I need a quick and secret way to get out of the room and hide ( like distracting everyone else while I would just go to the nurse or bathroom.)\nNot bringing attention to them\nMaybe make like a sign to leave the room like maybe like a piece of paper the can show secretly and they leave with no questions\nThis is just things I like maybe talk to them and their parents That is a great idea, thank you! Thank you for the links, the second one especially has left me with such a clear impression of what it could be like to have selective mutism. It is so sad to see how much of an influence teachers can be on students because of ignorance!\n\nI asked their mentor and apparently they only had their intake interview for the school yesterday (???) and because they feel that the student in't very different from the other students they will require them to finish the same assignments and exams as any other student. Which is really not helping, especially since we have a group presentation project early next year... I will take your suggestions and talk with the student about what they feel comfortable with. I really do not want to push them past their limits but I also do not want them to feel left out... Luckily, there is some time to come up with a solution.\n\nI am not sure if we have anything equivalent to IEPs and 504s in the Netherlands, I will have to check it out. The speaking exams are usually with a different teacher (to prevent bias) but do you think it would/could be better for them to take the exams with their own teacher? No problem, really it should be natural for teachers to look into something like selective mutism!\n\nThank you for your advice on group work, we have a project early next year that is in a group so I will make sure to keep an eye out for that! Luckily their younger brother is in the same class, so I think/hope that they will feel comfortable working together with him.\n\nYour podcast sounds great, definitely going to check it out! Thank you! This is great and exactly the reason why I went to this Reddit! There are so many views and opinions from \"experts\" who have never had to deal with selective mutism but I really want to hear the perspective from the students. Thank you! This is so short and easy to read through, I think I may need to print this and put it in the teacher lounge for my colleagues to see. Thank you! I had not really thought about what to do when they feel the need to get away from the classroom for a moment, I feel a bit dumb because obviously not every lesson will be perfect and the student may need it. Thank you for suggesting this!\n\nSadly, I have no contact with parents as a secondary vocation education teacher. I feel like it could be really useful though so I will bring it up with my colleagues! If it is possible, I really think it would be best that the student does the presentation with their own teacher, who they are more familiar and comfortable with. People with SM find it much harder to speak with someone who they do not know. That is what I was thinking, I will bring it up with my colleagues! If it is not possible for the student to do it with just me in the room, do you think it would still be better if it was me and a colleague? Or just the colleague? (sorry for all the questions!) Figuring out who the student is closest with in the class is one of the best things you can do. I had SM throughout all of elementary school, but I was lucky to have very understanding and helpful teachers. On school trips and such they would always pair me/group me together with my two friends I was comfortable with, whereas they paired the rest of my class randomly lol. And props to you for doing research/taking the time to learn about this, I am sure your student will really appreciate your efforts to help them out. Every student with SM needs a teacher like you!! \ud83d\udc95 Thank you for your kind words, I feel like every teacher should take the time to get to know their students and their struggles and find out how to help them! So happy to hear that you had kind and understanding teachers :)\n\nLuckily, their brother is in the same class and they seem pretty close. I will probably ask them if they have students that they like to work with beforehand if I have to make groups. I normally give students a random number and then they form groups with students with the same number, but it is just as easy to make it seem like the student randomly gets put together with students that they enjoy working with :) My guess is that the less obvious the better, right? Hmm. I am honestly not sure for this one. It all depends on how severe their SM is and what their preferences are etc. Since you said it is more towards the end of the year, they should be a bit more comfortable with you, possibly even enough to speak to you. (though that does depend on how severe the SM is) And people with SM do find it easier to when someone they are more comfortable with accompanies them, so it might help for you to be in the room. At the same time, more people they are not comfortable with=more anxiety, so it may be detrimental. So basically, it depends on whether they are comfortable with you or not at the time of the presentation. People with SM often take an extremely long time to warm up to people. Some more than others, and others take less time. Also, if you do decide to have them do the presentation with just your colleague without you, be sure the colleague knows about the student\u2019s SM and understands what it is beforehand. That way they could possibly prompt the student to speak (this helps some SMers get the words out) and help them along the way. \n\nPersonally, I think I would prefer there to just be the one teacher. The less people I am uncomfortable with, the better. It just shows that no one and nothing is the same, even SM and how people experience it. I think I will leave it up to the student and let them decide when we get closer to the exam date. That way they have had as much time as possible to get to know me and maybe/hopefully get comfortable with me.\n\nI will definitely talk to the colleague that does the exams! And probably also the others. Somehow they all know plenty about ADHD and dyslexia (also important) but anything that they feel is more rare/never see it in their classroom/out of their comfort zone... at best they know the most well known signs but that is it. I really wish that the school would provide training and other resources, it could make such a difference.\n\nThank you for all your advice and thoughts! :) Glad I could help. I just wanted to say, I think it is really awesome that you came here to learn more about SM to help your student. We really need more teachers like you. Unfortunately most of my experiences with my teachers as an SMer have been the opposite. I think the same goes for other SM sufferers. A lot of what I have been reading online seems to be bad experiences with teachers, which makes me so sad!\n\nOne of my many motivations to try to things right from the start is that I suffer from social anxiety (used to be pretty severe when I was younger) and even though it is a pretty well known condition so many teachers failed to give me what I needed. I cannot even imagine what that must be like with something like SM, which is still not nearly getting enough recognition despite the impact it has on someone is live! \n\nI really want to be a teacher who gives her students what they need, or at least as much as possible. Having a place like SM reddit is such a great place for me to learn things, I am so grateful for the advice and links that you and all the other members have given me. I will not be a teacher who failed to care for her students. Hopefully I will even be one who helps to open the eyes of her colleagues. But all the credit goes to you guys! :)", "How can I help my selective mute student? Hi everyone, I am a teacher and in my class I have a student who we think is selectively mute. I want to do everything I can to make sure they know that they are supported and understood.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Or would be willing to share what you wish your teachers knew/ should have done? hi! i am just starting this journey as my 4.5 y/o was diagnosed this summer and just started pre-k, so i dont have many tips yet. but one thing i can say, please try to keep parents overly informed, the anxiety around sending my little guy to school knowing he wont speak, fearing hell get bullied, or just be so sad/lonely, etc.. its so intense. and when he comes home from school, he doesnt want to talk about it (i think because it is so stressful for him) .. i know teachers have so much on their plate and they need to set boundaries to protect their time, but its so hard on moms!\n\nanother thought, his summer camp teacher had him spell words via an alphabet board to communicate \n\ngood luck! i know you are an amazing teacher!! Definitely do not force them to talk, that was the worse thing my teachers did was force me in situations where I had to talk. People with SM are not choosing to not talk they physically cannot, so please do not force them to talk. Encouraging is nice but do not be pushy, focus on making them comfortable if you can and lowering their anxiety levels. But having coloured cards that mean things, writing notes, speech cards. Any form of non verbal communication would be good. Good luck First of all, it is great that you are trying to understand and help your student! Keep in mind that most of us here can only speak from their own experience in school and are not professionals.\nI have SM and had some teachers that were amazing and some who could not deal with it at all. As I am about to start uni to become a teacher myself, I have thought quite a lot about how I would deal with selectively mute students in my class.\n\nHere are some things I consider to be of importance:\n\n- Find a way to communicate with them. Maybe they will not talk in front of the class but with you alone. Maybe they can talk \"through\" a friend. Maybe they can write things down for you. If they are older, they could also write e-mails. If they are younger, it is good to have the parents involved. For urgent communication during class, some students like to use prewritten signs (like \"can I go to the toilet\" or \"I am not feeling well\") for recurring situations.\n\n- Ignore them (but, like, the nice way). They probably do not want to be looked at or asked if they need help.\n\n- Let them skip things they do not want to do. Playing a game with the whole class? Your student will probably be very happy to watch from a safe distance. Students have to present their work? Your student will be happy to write a text about their work and hand it in if you remind them of that possibility.\n\n- If you do group work, let them switch groups if they feel like it. If they have a friend in your class, make sure that they can always work and sit together, if they want to do so.\n\n(I do not have more time right now but I can add more things later. If you are okay with sharing some information it would be good to know how old they are, what country you are from and if students of their age get grades there (and what counts into those grades). Also, are there any specific activities that the students do regularly that cause struggle? Giving advice on this topic is very hard when we do not have basic information) A handful of flashcards he can raise as needed to communicate with you, such as he needs the bathroom, or he needs assistance with a problem, or he does not feel well, etc. If he is able to write, perhaps a small white board he can communicate to you with. Just, if you use that option, do not take it away as punishment for \"talking\" to other students. Find other ways to remind him to focus on work during work times. \n\nAlways, always make sure any discipline does not take away whatever forms of communication he does have, or make him feel like he is the focus of everyone in the room. Emotional stress like that would likely only make it harder to cope. Personally when I moved schools the teachers offered too much help and counselling and I hated feeling like a freak/special and did not want other students finding out If the student has friends they feel comfortable with in the same class, seat them together.\n\nI saw some people talking about using flashcards for communication, but I think if the student is a bit older (eg. Preteen/teenager) it might make them a bit self conscious. Instead maybe try using hand signs that the entire class uses for important stuff (eg. going to the bathroom), and include whiteboards for group discussions for everyone to write their thoughts on. My child was comfortable using a white board to write answers but hated/refused the idea of communication cards. You can asked forced choice questions and hold up hands for them to touch. For example: do you like red (hold up right hand and leave it up) or blue (hold up left hand and keep it up)? There is a lot more to it so instead, I will link a guide specifically for teachers from the Child Mind Institute:\n\n Hi: I just spoke to someone who runs an SM program in NYC and he directed me to his free course online: (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthought you may be interested!", "I am totally alone and nobody cares \n\nI am just so so so tired of this I just want to scream and cry like a little kid but I cannot even so much as whisper.\nI try my best to be kind and gentle it is just how I am but somehow who I am is just disgusting and worthless no matter how much I devote myself to the well being of others. I love everyone I see and for that i am hated beyond belief. People act as if I clam up by choice and they get frustrated and begin to make threats and raise their voices which in turn makes me clam up even more. They really think I enjoy ruining my own life and inconveniencing others. My family is disappointed in me for having this, anxiety, depression, and being enby and their version of \u201chelp\u201d is \u201cjust talk to me\u201d . I am pittied, threatened, despised, and spoken poorly of behind my back and I am never going to be happy again. I am never going to enjoy laughing with a friend or answering correctly in geometry or be invited to any get together because I am a disgusting and despicable waste of flesh and blood.\n\nForgive me for adding this here but it helps kind of. Is this my brains secret account that posted this when sleeping?\n\nEvery. Fucking. Word. Is something I was just thinking this morning and a bunch of other times before that. No, you are good. As much as I hate it, it sucks because I know even if I was motivated enough to want out, it is almost not possible to get out....so same pain, new day....\n\nI just listen to a lot of Juice WRLD....and uh do the same thing with myself each day.....it repeats.\n\nEdit: What am I doing tomorrow...I do not know. Something similar to today. Hang in there. It will get better\n\nMedication and therapy and friends helped me. What you need is an online friend and a different mindset, what helped me is to see everyone else as pathetic. What did I do to them, is talking actually such a sin to be hated for? No it is not, so then why are these people angry at me? It is cuz they are pathetic little losers that just want to escape from their own family problems. When I got into that mindset everything got better, I did not bat a shit about people who used to shit on me for something I could not even control. Just knowing that you are not the only one suffering from this mental ilness can help a ton. You still have time bro \ud83d\ude0e Just try getting a god complex mindset I do not know u that much but no one deserves to feel that way. Find something that makes you happy and try to overcome this your not alone in how you feel. I felt much how you did a few times in my life but I realize I have others who care about me and there is just certain things in my life that I feel happy about and that pulled me away from those feelings. So basically look for what your greatful for and try to be near whatever that may be. We all have a purpose find what makes you happy and maybe you would not ever feel like a waste of flesh and blood again.", "I was a talkative child until 4th grade. I was diagnosed with SM later on but I do not understand why I was talkative before. I just do not understand. Maybe there was trauma I have forgotten about, because there were certainly things that happened, but nothing big enough to cause such a big change. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? I was extroverted and made friends extremely easily until around then. I was the same as a child. Super talkative with strangers before school started but once I went to school I completely froze up and could not talk. I do come from an abusive family so maybe that is what contributed to it, however there is little research surrounding trauma and selective mutism. Are you seeing a psychiatrist/therapist? My little boy just stopped talking at nurseryafter moving rooms at nursery, have no idea what the triggering factor was other than a change of circumstances. He is now in school and no change i feel like the same happened for me. Like it took me a few years of being naively open to people for all the rejection from being socially clueless to get to me(because I am likely autistic). I remembered making friends easily as a child, and I also talkative, maybe not in school, but I can still make friends. Until aboit the half-end of 6th grade, I stop talking. I think because I start to care how a classmate perceived me. \nEven as a talkative child, I still remembered sometimes I cant speak, or tell a lie even if things were not that serious  when I felt upset, threaten.   I had friends at school and I talked a lot to them and played together too. But as I got older, I started to 'lose' my friends and started to get more alone. Now, I usually just sit alone at break and wait until it ends. I was not very open and it was hard for me to make friends, so I only had school friends.\n\n  I have already thought about traumas that I might have passed through, but I do not think there was any trauma. It was more like important, but little, things that made me this way, but I do not know. I was similar... But a little more complex...\n\nUntil third grade I had difficulty NOT talking in class. To myself, people next to me, the teacher while she was instructing... Frequently in trouble for it.\n\nHad a couple of abusive teachers in 3rd &amp; 4th grade and things changed... And went quiet. Still speaking, usually, when called on... But frequently not.\n\nBy 6th grade I was regularly showing selective mutism when challenged, mocked, stunned or surprised...\n\nBut learning to \"control\" conversational anxiety by becoming a class clown when I was able...\n\nWhich has sorta  remained my friend-confusing pattern since then to now...\n\nBouts of  hyper speech, with frequent periods of inability to speak... I am now 67.\n\nI am not sure there seem to be a range of experiences... From total nonspeaking (possibly the extreme of the same phenomenon) to intermittent.\n\nI have written a bit about it.\n\n\n\n 6th grade was a turning point for me too...\n\nJunior high the worst period of my life.\n\nI think everybody else s social brain circuits kicked in...\n\nMine seem to have developed very slowly...\n\nAnd at best stunted...\n\nI suspect a form of neotony may be at play... \u201cBecause I start to care how a classmate perceived me\u201d - I can relate to this. I think SM has a lot to do with fear of other people\u2019s judgment, and I think it can get worse to the point where you cannot speak even when you are not being evaluated or seen. My father is about the same age as yours. He often talk in a really loud voice, or get work-up easily when talking to, or mention him. Often I never see him talk like people uaually talk, like the tone of people comfortably talking to one another. ", "*screams in nonverbal* ", "If I do not speak I will never be in trouble for what I said, right? I am 25f this year and in college but frankly I dont feel my age. I felt horrendously trapped and terrified to speak now. I did not realise I spoke so softly, and try as I may, the fear was like an iron wall trapping my voice.\n\nWhen I was called out by the teacher in front of my college class for speaking too soft, I felt so embarrassed. I shut up after that. I thought \"I should not have spoken. I should have shut up.\"\n\nFlashbacks to my younger days. And recently a feedback by what teachers thought.\n\nI asked too many questions but could not apply it physically (though I did well in literature class). Annoyed others too much. All these horrific things came at me. \nIf I do not speak, I would not get in trouble.\nEven if I am mediocre, its okay. Its okay because I will be safe. I will never be annoying.  Because I cannot speak. I cannot make any sound. I cannot be blamed for anything I said, because I did not say anything at all. I feel sad and trapped thinking this, but it is the only way I know I will be safe from their words. \n\nI feel robbed of my voice. Yet I am so afraid. I reflect on that quite a bit and for me, I did not have much desire to interact with others at school. Some people I actively ignored out of dislike, but most, I just did not have any desire or need to talk to or play with. As a baby, I always was satisfied to play by myself wherever I was put down and that seemed to have carried on through my childhood.\n\nBy the time I was interested (high school) I was not quite sure how, but was befriended by a very talkative person and a very pushy cat and shortly after that wanted to get a job. I am a 25f in college, as well, and when I first started speaking, I felt exactly like you do. I spoke too softly and whatever I said seemed out of place. But, as someone already mentioned.. you are going to be judged either way, and probably even more so if you do not talk. You are not robbed of your voice- you can overcome this! I have been trying my best for the past 7 years and it is a daily struggle, but it does get a little easier. People honestly do not even pay attention to what you say, nor do they care to at our age. So do not be afraid to speak up. Eventually that feeling of \"I should not have spoken\" will subside.", "Selective Mutism: More than just \"Not talking\" ", "How can I tell authority figures when I cannot speak Hello! I do not know if I would classify myself as a selective mute. I really do not know what the requirements are and I do not want to insert myself into a community that I do not belong in. That being said, maybe I am! Either way, I figured this would be a good place to reach out for help.\n\nI am a childhood trauma survivor, have PTSD, generalized anxiety, and am currently working towards a diagnosis of what I suspect is DID or OSDD.\n\nMost the the time I am perfectly comfortable speaking, but sometimes I literally cannot get words out. It does not feel like a choice. Sometimes I go completely catatonic and lose speech, other times I can still move but cannot speak. \n\nThis almost always only happens when I am extremely anxious, angry, or sad. It can be incredibly hindering: I was an inpatient at my hospitals mental health ward and got ZERO help from anyone because I could not speak to doctors. They all got fed up with me and just walked away when I would not answer their questions. (Side note: I am furious about the way I was treated there. That little anecdote is just the tip of the iceberg of my neglect while I was there)\n\nI am wondering how I can tell people, especially authority figures such as my boss or maybe a transit cop that I cannot speak in that situation. \n\nWhen I was a kid it was much worse: I could not speak to men unless they were close family or friends. It is gotten better since then as I am now 21. There are laminated cards you can buy or make that say \"I have selective mutism\" and go on to explain what that means and how to communicate. The best one I have seen online is from stickman communications. I carry one in my wallet in case I am pulled over by the police, or need to let someone know why I am not talking. I have not used it yet, so I cannot say how well they work. This was going to be my suggestion. You could even write your own card to hand someone if you wanted. I have a non verbal medical tattoo if i need it, though i understand that is quite extreme for most. Try stickman cards? I recently went to the ER, and within a minute of being taken back realized I wasnt going to be able to cope. I was able to communicate this and also that I am autistic. The nurse was having none of it. \n\nThe doc asked me medical questions, and I could nod but could not even find the answers in my brain let alone speak them given the level of noise and chaos around me on my gurney next to the nurse's station. I did manage to choke out \"I am autistic and it is too loud!\" before completely melting down and freaking out. It got worse with the nurse after that, and I ended up leaving, despite having serious health concerns.\n\nI wrote a letter to the customer service of the hospital detailing my experience and their failure to accommodate. The kicker is, I am a middle aged woman who is high functioning enough that people do not usually suspect I am autistic. I have never had a public meltdown before, and certainly never lost my agency. It was a horrible experience to having my concerns dismissed and being treated like a petulant child.\n\nI feel for you, OP, as this happened to me just a couple of days ago, and these fresh raw feelings of rage and hurt have yet to leave me.\n\nMy plan is to make a paper saying I am autistic and sometimes unable to speak. I will also list answers to basic medical questions, so if I ever have to go back, I will not get into this situation. (I will also remember to bring noise-cancelling headphones!) \n\nThanks to the other responders here. I will look into the stickman cards. I am 20, similar situation. Also working on a diagnosis, pretty sure I have DID. I reccommed putting a note in your phone case or wallet that you can show them with a short explanation, like \"I cannot speak, please be patient.\" I also use text-to-speech apps, especially ones that allow me to customize the voice, because it is useful for different alters who may want to sound different from each other. It mostly gets its use at home between my fiance and roommate and I, but it is super super useful. I got pulled over and was shaking uncontrollably... I put my hands on the steering wheel and closed my eyes and said officer I have terrible PTSD... and he was amazing and kind after that. He changed his tone of voice... I made it through I am so sorry that you went through this. I also experienced a very traumatic situation at a hospital with a nurse who mistreated me. I reported her and was told she thought she was helping me and she would not be reprimanded. I had a huge meltdown and was literally sobbing and she was still being rude and pushy because, \"she thought she was helping\". It is absolutely despicable that people in a position to care for others can get away with treating someone so badly that they lose control of themselves in a state of panic. Terrorizing someone is NOT treatment. Your feelings are justified and I hope someone listens when you tell your story. We all deserve to be treated with respect. I have a card that I made for social situations, but a card for situations like this would also be a good idea. Just something small that explains that you sometimes go nonverbal. My friend recently remarked how fortunate I was not to be sent to the psych facility. That was an eye opener. If I were more of an explosive autist and less of the sobbing sort, I can totally see this happening easily.\n\nI am sorry you went through this as well! Even if your nurse was trying to be helpful, it was obvious she was not, and needs more training to be functionally helpful instead of harmful.\n\nI am fairly articulate when I am not completely overwhelmed, and I am not intimidated by authority, so I hope someone is held accountable for their actions, and more importantly, I hope they can find a better way for autistic people to function in the ER. I mean, we need access to services like everybody else, and with small accommodations can do so.", "I wrote myself into a corner and now I have to talk. I am in the drama program at my school which this one does not do theatre productions, this one makes movies/shows, I had an idea for a show and I emailed it to the teacher and now that is what we are doing this year.\nSo anyway, I decided to play a character that is kind of important to the whole story and I made the very smart decision to try speaking as this character and I gave him a bunch of lines, when I was writing the script I felt like I could do it but now I am having second thoughts.\nI have been singing alone in my bedroom at night so I am now comfortable with my voice but I am still really nervous about talking in front of people. Talk with your teacher about it. Be open and your teacher will help you calm your nerves and probably help you practice one on one until you are ready. If you do not like it then just stick to writing. You are in school to learn, you are not a pro.

In fact, I can talk to pretty much anyone, but talking to people I am interested in dating is pretty much been the place where I have had the most difficulty communicating too. And that means people who I am just barely interested in. \n\nI have had to literally stop people from trying to date me because once I have sexual feeling or get attracted to them, I lose my ability to talk to them. I have had to push away all possible girls because it was simply unsafe and scary power imbalance.

From someone who is dateing a guy with selective mutism the only thing can say is please do not worry about the fact that you do not speak around them. When you find that one person that will stick with you even when you do not speak you will not ever feel any of the things you do right now. When I am with my boyfriend the silence is never a problem for me and we have been together for a long time so he is completely comfortable in making noises when he needs to (has not yet talked to me but that has not ever stopped me from loving him as much as i do.)Trust in me that you will find your soulmate who will be patient with you.

I am autistic and there were never a pont where I started to have mutism, it was always there. Can you be born woth it? I am both autistic and selectively mute. A lot of people who are selectively mute are also autistic. wait I am selectively mute is autism something I should look into? Well it would not hurt to look into it. I also looked into autism after I looked into selective mutism Please tell me online quizzes are not accurate at all the aspie quiz is pretty accurate. Could you send a link  Thank you Not necessarily. The two are not linked, but it is possible to have both alongside each other. If you have symptoms of autism though it would not hurt to look into it. I have been diagnosed with both too. I developed SM when I was a toddler. Probably around the time I was starting preschool. Before that I was speaking. I do not remember a time before SM. I think your question is a super interesting one. I know mental health disorders are typically mix of genetics and environment. So while genetic predisposition is a thing, it seems unlikely you can pop out of the womb with a fully developed anxiety disorder. But this is totally guesswork on my part. It would be interested in seeing if there is any research regarding if there is a limit to how young you can be and have a full blown anxiety disorder. The thing is, I always had the selective mutism symptoms, even before the speaking part hit..So I just tell people I was born that way Same here I have both SM and Asperger's, but I do not really see a connection between the two, at least for me. SM for me has always been rooted in my anxiety. Anxiety Disorders can be comorbidities of autism.. I am sure, but I just do not see them being connected in my head The way autistic people are treated surely cause anxiety and the traits also could cause the anxiety because it not the norm idk. i am not a professional I have autism and selective mutism. Assessment papers trace my symptoms back as early as preschool.\n\nI always assumed the SM had more to do with my mother than my autism. It was a nightmare trying to get her to respond positively to anything I said, and I often felt I was better off not trying to speak at all. My daughter was diagnosed with both last year. I have fairly certain I am on the spectrum as well but its is unconfirmed. I hope you can get your diagnosis if you want it! I go back and forth on it. It is not covered so it is quick pricy and I do not know if there is any benefit to me diagnosed now. I have done a lot of research into for myself over the years and found ways to manage it. It was more important for me to get my daughter diagnosed and get her the help she needed. She went from being almost completely mute to talking my ear off! I have SM and Asperger's as well. I was SM all throughout school. I was diagnosed with Asperger's by a psychologist when I was 18.", "I do not feel like talking. Sometimes I stay five, six hours without talking. I do not like to speak, use words or my voice. I like to be silent and i would like to stay like this for hours, maybe days.

But when I am not anxious and just \"I do not feel like talking\" is different from when mutism strikes. I just choose not to talk, simple like that. I sign up and point out when someone asks me something and that is it. \n\nDoes anyone else feel that? This total unwillingness to just do not talk sometimes. i think so. i eventually became fully mute after awhile. though if i REALLY tried i could learn to talk again, but i just do not want to. I do not like to talk to others people. When I am alone in my room I like to talk in some random language or sing or whatever, but when I am outside I just prefer not. Even with my mom or my friends I prefer do not talk. Silence is so much better. for most of the time, I talk as little as possible, especially when I am in a depressive mood.", "69m and just discovered I am a selective mute I know there are many times I should have said things and I did not, but I never allowed myself to question it. I have always had reasons why I should not ask people for information and I have never been able to ask for help - so this is a first. Looking back now I can see it has had a massive effect on my life, such as never getting a drivers license. I am now comfortable going into a shop and asking an assistant for help, but this has only happened recently. I have never been able to even consider my possible mutism because my subconscious has been trying to protect me from terrible home truths.  But recently my rational self has worked a few things out and I now know my father was not my father and could not stand to be in the same room as me. And in addition my mother tortured me mercilessly with cigarette burns when I was an infant. This has opened the doors to viewing the consequences, as they have affected me. So I am wondering where to go from here. I live in NZ. Yeh, I discovered this sub recently. Am 37 and been kind of battling this all my life I think. Recently I got a job where I have to talk to people a lot and it is off script stuff, not \"have a nice day\" and then their gone. I have to improvise what to say in the moment and I am finding it really tough. \n\nI have actually changed a ton since I was a kid though but totally out of necessity. I used to start shaking if I had to talk to too many people. My first job when I was 16 I worked in a grocery store as a cashier and shook everyday from having interact with so many people. I got over it though, it stopped eventually. I listened to what other cashiers said, stuff like \"hows your day\" and \"have a good day\" and I would just mimic them. I hated it and I hate small talk still but I can do it now to some degree when I need to at work. \n\nI went looking for materials for adults with SM and found NOTHING. If you are a kid then there is a bunch shit out there for everyone, your parents, therapists, teachers, etc. but nothing for adults. :(", "Freestyle recorded this yesterday; call me the ex mute kid lol  I have a more lyrical full song I also freestyled on yt ( I feel the more people I can get to hear and acknowledge my voice the more speaking confidence I have.

I hope you keep it up!", "Just Venting I was messaging my friend and telling her about how I struggle to make friends at school,\nand about how my classmates do not really interact with me anymore.\n\nShe told my to just suck it up because I do not make the effort to communicate with them. \n\nShe knows I cannot speak so she told me to use paper to communicate, but doing that makes me kind of nervous.\nI do not know why, but I get anxious when I talk to my classmates in non-verbal ways (writing on paper, messaging, etc).\n\nI did become friends with one of my classmates a few months ago by communicating with paper though. I struggled a bit but I am glad I got a friend. \n\nStill, I cannot believe she told me to just suck it up. I feel like she does not take my selective mutism seriously and just sees me as a shy and quiet person.\n\nI know people will not talk to me if I do not talk to them first, but I struggle so much when I have to communicate with people in real life. \n\nSo how can I just \"suck it up\"? \n\nShe said she knows I am sad about this, but said she is right in this situation; so I have to take it as a \"learning opportunity\".", "How do you cope with being mute in public situations? I have agoraphobia and selective mutism, I was thinking on going out somewhere like a restaurant or something but it is been a long time since I went anywhere by myself and had to talk to people.\n\nI was wondering, how do you all cope with being mute in public situations like this? How do you communicate? Do you bring like a board or sketch pad? Or what?\n\nAny advice is appreciated, I do not really have anyone who can help me with this right now. I have a note on my phone that I have the font set really high on. I will wave to someone like a clerk when I come in, take my time looking at stuff, and pretype my message before I approach.\n\nI also find that knowing a few common signs in your native sign language helps. (Mostly 'thank you' 'youre welcome' 'sorry') Most people get the idea of thank you,  but you can type it too. I have never had a clerk rebuff me for using my phone. I think that is a good idea, thank you. \n\nWhere I am at, there are a lot of deaf people, so I think people are a little bit more accustomed to this here than elsewhere. But it is just working up the nerve to actually try it that is the real issue. You can try bringing a friend with you. I am usually better in public and can sometimes even speak to strangers when I have one of my friends with me. I wish, but I do not really have that many friends. I do not usually go out alone so my husband does the talking for me. Yeah I feel 100x more comfortable around my Family in public situations, when I am alone and the attention is on me, that is when I am the most nervous in public.\n\nYesterday I went to pick-up food for my Family from Friendly's since I have been doing that lately. I almost did not talk to the women but eventually I pushed the few required words out since I do not make any small talk or say thank you after. I will just give a nod or something as I leave. I think volume is my biggest concern, as in the past they always had a hard time hearing me and I am sure they still do and just fill in what they think they are hearing me say.\n\nFamily is my main issue which is ironic because I am more comfortable in public with them, probably because they are my shield. Where as alone, I have zero shield. I am always shaky in public alone when I go and talk to someone, and I do not ever expect it when someone tries to talk to me, so I literally get startled by it. When I was driving back in my car from another food place, a random guy said from another car \"I like your car man,\" something like that and I flew out of my seat. I was nervous and since I doubted I would be able to speak loud enough for him to hear me clearly, I just gave a thumbs up back to him. That was that.\n\nEdit: That is my biggest public fear is that they will not hear me because my volume is so out of practice. And tbh I still hate communicating in Public, it is not a joy of mine but it is gotten less taxing on me over the few weeks I have been going to pick-up my family food. I will not hesitate as hard, although I still will getting out of the car initially.\n\nEdit: And scratch that...1000x more comfortable, besides feeling self-conscious of myself. I feel free to really more be myself in public when I am with family. Otherwise I am very rigid.\n\nEdit: And the most important idea to keep is that, talking is the normal way, and that these people are strangers. And I forgot what else I was going to add after that... :I pointing and writing/texting are the easiest go tos. avoid going to places during rush hour, eat dinner at 5 instead of 630, go to the coffeeshop at 7 instead of 9, etc. good luck! u do not Umm ok I have an app on my phone that I love! I got it on Google Play. It is called \"Tell Me\" I really like it because you can save sentences; set the tone, volume, and speed; and it is all free as far as I know! I have used it before because I am autistic and go nonverbal. I had to use it at work like my third day because I had a meltdown and went totally nonverbal. My manager was a lot more gentle with me after that lol. Oh that is neat, I might check that out.\n\nI am autistic too. This probably would have been helpful back when I had a job.

I use to be the same way, it was extremely hard for me to post comments on reddit, it made me so anxious and I would overthink every post and comment for hours. Now I can just post so easily though, without even thinking about it. Honestly, the only thing I did was just doing it even when I was scared. Like cliche advice, I know, but it really worked for me. Just post more and the fear will disappear. But yeah, I get completely what you are talking about. I re-read my messages or posts sooooo much it is actually ridiculous. If I post anything, anywhere and I will think about it for days and if I screw up, spell something wrong, misunderstand something ect, I will not forget it... ever lol literally just ran into this problem. One of my old friends texted me and I spent about 15 minutes typing and rereading my response, then sat and stared at the send button for even longer. I eventually sent it but I am still freaking out lol. There is a flaw in logic where commonly one might conclude that it ought to be easier to talk to people on the internet. The internet has a veil of the unknown. It is still a person you are talking to. The internet has different sets of social rules and norms. Those are not necessarily any better for communicating. Same here... I have hard time replying unless it is a fight.  I often sit and wonder what I should say, how I should say it, what will they think of me if I say it.  I usually give a smiley or a thumbs up and move along.  I usually only reread something if I feel like it was a real zinger. yep. i usually try to comment something, and then end up deleting instead. same with messages. it is just hard for me to communicate generally. This is my real name, my 9 year old daughter is only able to communicate online to strangers but not about herself, Roblox and Tic Tock, she gets excited about the comments so I encouraged  her to reply to them to be polite and get more likes which is a huge motivation for her.\n\nDoes it help you when you are not the subject?  If it is better for you please feel free to message me directly.  :)\n\nHave a great day \n\nKim", "Is it advisable to claim SM when you are undiagnosed? I am 17, running 18. I have had issues that\u2019ve aligned w/ SM for the longest time. I have always suspected it, but I never was able to get help and I am too hesitant to fully claim it. The thing that confuses me the most, is that when something triggers my state of anxiety/panic, I am mentally apathetic and I think it is my brain putting up barriers to protect myself out of fear. I cannot process any info, and I cannot say much other than short/empty phrases, and I somewhat dissociate. My struggle to speak genuinely or present myself authentically has always been present, and I am starting to panic about my future. I had my first interview and it was extremely disappointing. I have so many dreams and hopes, I want to work in the art/animation field, I want to be happy w/ others, and I want to be someone others can depend on. I am just tired of not being able to live authentically... I feel like any type of industry work/communal work expects some level of personality and charisma (no ones going to hold onto an employee w/ no chemistry, no matter how well they work). I am so worried (for many reasons) that I will have to work in a drab and empty job- or just not work at all. I want to see how things would be if I took some steps to better understand my chances (ie, claim SM, use SM to preface my behaviors to others in school and work, understand what college &amp; work is like for people w/ SM/disability). Is this advisable? Is it okay for me to go forward w/ this? Should I just wait?\nTDLR; I have had issues that\u2019ve aligned w/ SM for a long time but I am not diagnosed, now that I am getting into work &amp; colleges, I am panicking about how to navigate everything. Is it a good idea to just \u201cself-diagnose\u201d and proceed in telling others I experience SM? (Also, any advice for how to navigate finding work or the workplace w/ SM?) I would imagine the issues with self-diagnosing SM are the same that go along with self-diagnosing any other mental disorder. Dissociation and being unable to process information are not pure symptoms of SM for one, it does not mean you do not have it, just that a psychiatrist would be better able to help understand if it is SM or SM and something else or something else. Both of those can be explained by the anxiety SM causes or by something else.\n\nIn an unofficial setting saying \"I think I have SM\" is not an issue, although in official settings the burden of proof comes up anyway.\n\nIt is also worth noting, if you do have a separate diagnosis of social anxiety or general anxiety, neither of those diagnoses are actually \"less severe\" than SM, the \"amount\" of anxiety experienced is not even necessarily less than that experienced by someone with SM.\n\nThis did not really answer your questions, just adding some stff to the conversation. Thank you for your response! I definitely see the concerns of it all, but I am also concerned because I likely will not be able to get help for a long time. I appreciate the time taken to respond, and this helps a lot :) I am not sure how helpful telling people you have SM without the diagnosis paperwork will be to be honest. It is not a well understood disorder. With a diagnosis you might be able to get some accommodations at school. However, it can be helpful to think of school/college as an opportunity to face your fears and make mistakes in a safe environment. It is painful at first, but part of recovering from an anxiety condition often involves putting yourself in uncomfortable conditions and overcoming them little by little. As someone on the other side, I can tell you it is so so worth it to do that difficult work.\n\nYou went to an interview. That is an amazing first step! You did not let your anxiety stop you. Each time you do something like that that scares you you break down the wall a little more and teach your brain that it does not need to protect you with silence.\n\nDo not be too hard on yourself about your first interview. Interviewing is a skill that takes practice. I completely fluffed my interview for my dream job at the age of 21. Full on blanked and could not speak. I came home, threw myself on my bed and just cried for days. I thought my dreams were over. Of course, they were not! Two years later I interviewed for it again and got the job! Progress is possible. Go at your own pace and be kind with yourself. \n\nIf you cannot access help right now, there are still things you can do to help yourself. I really like these free workbooks: ( From my experience in the southern United States, even in professional setting, no one has ever asked for proof of diagnosis. The only exception for me was getting vocational rehabilitation and in that case they sent me to a psychiatrist to get diagnosed, but I was not able to get a copy of them for any other purpose. If I was younger when I started to receive help, and was allowed to ask for accommodations for school, then I would think the college I went to would have asked and then be sent to a psychiatrist then.\nI wish this was not case and I had better support structures here, but it either did not exist or was not offered to me. I asked for help throughout my childhood, but only received it in adulthood.", "As I talk to my online friends I start to realize how lonely I am I can never talk at school and even hearing people online talk about their friends make me want to cry. I have started to realize how different I am from a normal person and it hurts a lot. I can never relate to them and they surely cannot relate to me. Every time someone even brings up talking to really people it makes me want to push them away and just stop talking to them. I know it is bad and judgmental but I cannot help it. I hate hearing about things that remind me of my loneliness and it makes me sad. I conpletely understand how you feel. It is really tough. That sense of comparison can be really painful. I have been there too. It felt so unfair that something so so hard for me was something others could do easily. \n\nIt can get better though. Things change and you can change too. It is ok to be sad, but you will not be sad forever. oh my god I relate so much to this. It really sucks when you are talking to a friend and they bring up their other friends, I especially hate it when I am talking to someone and they leave to talk to somebody else, it'ts really annoying. :/ Yeah except i do not have friends so I cannot relate to that but i know how it feels", "Frustration and ASL \n\n2020 has been a stressful year or all of us. There have been times I needed to communicate with my daughter and a person walks in and silence. I have had to use my phone to communicate with text and pull her into a car to understand what she needs. Since she is 7, and there have been a lot of health scares and deaths in the family, this system is not working out. \n\nI think I am going to try and teach her ASL. That way I can understand her in all situations. Thoughts? Sounds like a good idea. There are a lot of great YouTube channels and websites that help to learn and teach ASL. If you have a diagnosis you could go to an independent living or other disability services to get classes and support also. Texttospeech the app on apple is a great app that can also talk for you. I have read on this subreddit that there are people that know ASL and have SM, but they still cannot use it on the situations that they cannot speak. I can be wrong though. If ASL feels like a functional and engaging form of communication for her (and ba association, you), then by all means go for it.\n\n\n\nCheck out Bill Vicars website (Lifeprint) for a reliable resource to start with (both for ASL specifically and for background about Deaf culture).\n\nMore generally, be aware of what resources you are using (and consider also looking for local and/or virtual Deaf community groups/meetups/resources). By this I mean not every YouTube or app resource you find is actually a reliable source, with respect to ASL itself and/or to Deaf culture. The best/preferred teachers are Deaf, or else CODA (child of deaf adult(s)).", "First known mention of Selective Mutism is thought to have been in 1877, 'aphasia voluntaria'. At the same time and by the same man (Adolph Kussmaul) who first mentioned dyslexia, which he called 'word blindness'. It angers me that people think, or ever thought that selective mutism was a choice. I cannot even imagine why someone would choose not to talk. Even if someone did choose not to talk, they would not be able to maintain it for very long. They would just get frustrated and start talking again. Exactly", "Worth diagnosing? Hi, I am completely new here. I have suspected for a long time I might have SM and tonight another redditor pointed me here. I have been crying my eyes out since reading half of the first info-link here.\n\nI do not think I have ever told anyone about my suspicions. My case is not severe, I think. It always happens when I am frightened or in an otherwise anxious situation. It has damaged a lot of relationships for me and when it happens I am so ashamed and angry at myself. I have been to a specialist already for ADHD and I do not know if I have the energy to go through all that again to maybe get a diagnosis for SM even though it sucks to be like this.\n\nIs it worth it? Definitely. Once you get diagnosed, you can be given treatment. If you receive the correct treatment, you can actually overcome it completely, unlike ADHD. In your case it sounds like a diagnosis and treatment may be beneficial as SM is obviously having a negative impact on your life. And as someone who is been diagnosed with both ADHD and SM, the process of being diagnosed with SM is so much easier than with ADHD. Once you are diagnosed, treatment for SM entails exposure therapy, (with baby steps, you should not go to fast) cognitive behavioral therapy, medicine, school/work support, and understanding from family/friends. There are meds for SM? Yes, but not meds *specifically* for SM. Antidepressants (SSRIs) are usually the meds prescribed for SM, as SSRIs are very effective in treating anxiety. The most common SSRIs used in treatment for SM are Prozac and Zoloft. Note that medicine for SM is meant to be used along with other treatments, like exposure therapy. Meds are rarely effective in treating SM on their own. I know how you feel, I just want to say that pills did not help me.. they made it worse. Just so you know that it might not be the answer. \n\nYou are not alone however, I cried an entire day when I read about it. Haha. So yeah, it is okay to cry. Know you are not alone. It was you! Thank you! I have been crying on/off the whole evening after coming to this subreddit.\n\nReally though, I thought it would be even harder to find a doctor who knows about SM than ADHD. I learned about this condition from a TV show, before that I always thought I just sucked because I could not speak. Still kind of do. Thanks again \u2661 I have been offered and prescribed SSRIs before but I have refused to take them. I tried some and the side effects were so wacky I threw them out. I do not want to mess my head any more than it is already messed, haha...\n\nHaha, really you cried too? Have you sought help? I get that.. it is weird that we are even being prescribed those pills. \n\nYeah, it was strange seeing it say \"it is not exclusively something people with Asperger's have\".. I cry when I need to unload too or when I watch sad movies, read sad books etc. It just is.\n\nCan I ask you a question? If you cannot sleep, what do you do? &gt;&lt; Well yes, you are right, it is fairly difficult to find a psychologist who knows about SM, let alone someone who *understands* it. For this reason, be sure to put a lot of thought and research in what psychologist you go to. It is rare, but there are some psychologists who fully understand SM *and* know how to treat it. It just takes some research to find them. I just meant the actual process of getting diagnosed is easier than getting diagnosed with ADHD. ADHD requires a more extensive evaluation/testing. Right, I get it. This all is so much to process *as is* that I actually feel light headed. Thanks for your response again, I think I will start doing research after I feel clearer in the head again... Well, I love reading books so if I cannot sleep I will read or listen to an audio book. Focusing on my breath has helped a lot because it is OK if your thoughts get distracted - you can always go back to your breath. :) Important thing is to shift your focus from inability to fall asleep to something that soothes/relaxes you. I am in a sort of limbo right now.. I am not sure if anything I have done this week had made any difference at all. I feel like I have given my all but somehow I have not connected with anyone to be able to show it so it probably was for nothing.\n\nHow do I drop that and just sleep?", "What causes people to develop selective mutism?  Wouldnt it be nice if we knew lol.\n\nVery young children of many different backgrounds can have SM. It is really hard to tell what causes it.

I have had SM for as long as I can remember. My 24th birthday is in 10 days, and I would say I can talk to most people now, but there are still certain people or situations that still make me mute. Anyway, there are certain words and names I cannot say. Hi. Bye. Thank you. Sorry. My first name. Like, I can talk to people, but not use those words. Is there anyone else with SM who has a similar issue? Oooh, I am relating to this. Would throw \u201cI love you\u201d on the list. I do not really call people by name ever. So weird for some reason i can rarely call my boyfriend by his name lol. but i dont really have a problem with calling my friends and siblings by their names, its so weird Funny enough, Sorry, thank you, ok, yes, and no, make up 99.9% of my speech with most people. Although i will usually gesture for yes and no. Not specific words, more like specific situations. Like  I stop being able to speak when I get super emotionally upset. I cannot ever say \u201cI love you.\u201d It sucks. Some other common ones are names, certain phrases like \u201chappy birthday\u201d, etc. This might not be the same exactly, but swear words. Even if they are in the name of a book/ tv/ show I want to watch. Cannot say the title of that show. A few times there have been swear words in things I am supposed to read out loud and I panic my biggest ones are i love you, thank you, and please. it really sucks, especially when somebody tells me they love me and i cannot return it, no matter how much i want to. i also struggle with calling people (sometimes even pets) by their names. I also cannot say my name! Or anyone\u2019s name tbh. It takes a lot of mental prep and it feels very unnatural if I ever do have to force myself to use someone is name Same, it just feels so weird to say that. When someone says \"I love you\" I always say \"equally\", or \"me too\". Saying \"please\" and people's name are also impossible for me. It took me the longest time to start saying I love you to my parents And too your parents of all people \ud83d\ude31 i have difficulty saying \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d using people\u2019s names has also been difficult but I have gotten better at it I think it is because there is generally a lot of pressure to say certain phrases like that, and SM does not do well under pressure so it makes sense if you think about it I call people \u201chey\u201d lol cause I try to get their attention but I cannot say their name so it is just hey I do that too! Ah I know I am so late but sameeee! I knew it would be to do with anxiety/SM etc but I am surprised there is so many who feel the same!\nBy the looks of it, it is an actual thing lol. Wonder why... i feel that, certain words and phrases are just Worse", "inner conflict I am in therapy, not specifically for my sm but because my mom is strange (another story). My therapist is very nice and tries her best with me. I write to her with paper she provides each session and I try hard to explain things. So far I have not spoke a word (actually I have not spoken in over a month).  \nLately she focuses on my sm. I told her it feels physical sometimes and the pain that comes from trying to talk/talking. I also told her that when I cannot talk, I do not always feel scared, but I feel a weight in my chest. She really does try her best I think but she does not understand. She makes it out as a choice and tells me about how beneficial talking can be. I really want to work with her but when the idea comes up I am scared away... I gave her a (not very convincing) excuse having to do with my situation at home and waiting until I am older. I know this is proving to her that I am \"choosing\" to be this way...I just do not know how to go from here or how to explain this to her. I do not know why I feel this way when I want it so bad Not sure if this is going to be helpful..\n\nDo you maybe feel like if you speak that you will not actually be heard? That whatever you say might be invalidated?\n\nAt young age silence was engraved in me by my mother whenever it came to thoughts/emotions. I feel pain in my chest when I want to speak but cannot actually bring myself to do it at times now. I just physically cannot. The overwhelming heaviness I get from it makes me insanely anxious. When asked to speak in times like these I just cannot seem to get anything out. Plus, when someone asks or expects a word from me it adds to the pressure. My anxiety often gets the best of me and I overthink things. I do have what I want to say in mind though. I repeat it in my head over and over again and occasionally I am capable of getting my mouth open to speak\u2026but nothing comes out. Often times I feel like what I am saying/have to say just is not worth saying because no one will listen so I give up.\n\nJust felt like sharing my part so maybe you will not feel alone. Everyone goes mute for different reasons or no reason at all and that is okay as long as it does not harm you. Speak when you are ready or comfortable doing so. It is an uncontrollable reaction I would say more than it is a choice. Like instinct almost?\n\nPersonally, I have never been silent for more than a couple of days so I am not entirely sure how much help this is. Maybe you could try typing things out ahead of time so you have the time and a clear mind to really think about things if you want. I wish i knew there were people like me before. I always felt so alone and not human, and no one ever gets it. Its so hard to process my thoughts most of the time and here you said it perfectly. i always feel awful for my feelings and want to tear myself apart. my mom is similar and treats me like im a monster. What Is so wrong with me?? I checked in a lot on this post and i was going to delete it until i saw this message. when i started reading it i felt really faint and jeez im crying a lot. Thank you. Well, you are not alone! I actually recently figured that out myself. My significant other did not understand why I am the way I am so I tried to do some research and happened upon this subreddit. It is a real struggle to get those around you to understand. My partner still does not quite understand it but tries to be more patient now.\n\nDo not feel awful for your feelings though! Everything you feel is valid. Validate your feelings! Even if someone does not understand or finds it to be burden somehow know you have got your back! That is what counts. People can be hateful. A lot of people do not understand and will reactive negatively instead of taking their time to learn something new. Just be accepting of yourself and know your value. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. Emotions are hard to figure out at times and even harder to deal with. Especially if you are young. Over time you will learn to take really good care of yourself mentally and emotionally and will eventually help someone else learn how.\n\nI almost did not message because I was afraid I would make myself sound like a fool. My anxiety was screaming at me to leave it be but I saw no one else messaged so I finally decided to tell myself \u201cto heck with it\u201d haha Hopefully it was a good cry though! Crying can help so much. Let it out. Do not be afraid to feel. Let yourself heal. I am really glad that I could help.\n\nThank you for making this post! I am sure there were likely others too afraid to say something but simply reading it also helped them feel less alone. :) Yeah. I am now 11 and wish that my 6 year old self knew you guys were out there. I think my sm and anxiety just got worse thinking no one out there was like me.

We do a weekly movie or we play a game or something and I always look forward for that day it is always my favorite day of the week. If anyone has some tips or something I would appreciate it. \n\n\nMy parents has offered many times to set me up with a therapist but I never have gone it is different talking to someone face to face about your problems then to random people on the internet that have no idea who you are. I do not have many friends the friends I do have are family friends or family or a few people online. The people online idk why I have fun hanging out and talking but after a little bit I just do not feel that interested any more and start to hide or get away from talking even if they are really nice good people I just do not want to idk why I have always wanted to have close friends but there is no one my age in the town I live in and never really put in the work idk why. It is the same with my SM I do not put in the work to get over it idk why I want to but never really do it since I live in a small town in the middle of no where I do not really have to spend time with people so I do not really ever think I have to.\n\n\nMy family are very supportive and never try to force me to talk to people. They do try and get me to talk but if I cannot they will leave it and not try and push me to do it. I would like to talk to family friends when we have family friends they are not just friends they are family a lot of them come to family gatherings holidays birthdays everything so I am close to a lot of them but have never talked to them and I do want to but never have been able to.\n\n\nI think that is it for now these are just things I have been wanting to talk about for a while and never have.", "Finally figured it out Growing up I always thought of myself as shy. I did not talk much at school and I was not able to order food for myself at restaurants until I was basically a teenager. I was the quiet kid, but only under specific circumstances. As I got older I came to recognize those circumstances as situations that triggered my anxiety and did everything I could do to get better at handling them. I realized that I was not shy, just anxious, and that I actually love to talk to people - even strangers, under the right circumstances. In my mind I function pretty well now, just the occasional spike in anxiety.  But I have been trying to build self confidence and apparently there is an area of my life where I have been letting it run rampant.\nIve been in a relationship for 11 years and...I cannot talk to him. Anytime we argue or I get too emotional, I shut down and...I cannot talk. I try but its like I do not have any words, I cannot come up with anything worth saying, and its awful. I just end up answering all his questions with \"I do not know\" and apologizing inbetween spells of sobbing and silence. It goes without saying that this is extremely frustrating and causes a lot of problems. This whole time he has not been able to understand why I do not just talk to him, and has been super resistant to the idea of communicating through text. He has been especially frustrated because it literally does not matter how or when he approaches me, I cannot verbally hold a coherent conversation with him about our issues and the negative emotions surrounding them. I have a psych degree and 4 years experience working in mental health and this whole time it never occurred to me to try and figure out why I have known this man for 11 years and still cannot have a normal conversation with him about my emotions without locking up. I finally just googled it and was surprised at how quickly I found an answer. My biggest baddest demon, the one that I hate the most, can only be Selective Mutism. I do not know if having a name for it changes anything, but somehow it does comfort me to know. I have been trying to get my s/o to understand for years that my behavior is not intentional, I really cannot hold a conversation with him when one or both of us is upset and emotional discussions are difficult for me regardless. I sent him some things to read and talked to him a little about it and he seemed supportive, so hopefully in the future he can be more understanding and we can better connect. \n\nIn the meantime, do yall have any advice? \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48 Sm is not caused by not having nothing worth saying You misunderstand. This is not \"I cannot think of anything to say so I will not say anything\" this is \"My brain will not form anything resembling a response to what you have to say so I just will not say anything\" every time we get in anything serious argument, for 11 years. Sometimes its so bad I physically cannot form words, but usually, there are just no words to form. But way to roll out the welcome wagon for me man, I appreciate it. Might be sm , I do not know. I believe most people with it can think of what to say but cannot make a sound. I have too much to say but can never say it Its weird because its kind of like having a ton to say and nothing to say at the same time. Like I think about everything he says but not in a way that allows me to verbalize it. There are thoughts, but my brain is not processing them the same way. Instead of thinking in sentences I think in big concepts and it just does not translate at all. You know how some people have to write out or rehearse what they are going to say before they make a phonecall in case they get anxious and forget what they are going to say as soon as they pick up the phone? The feeling I am trying to avoid by doing that is pretty close to what I experience when this happens, but like for much longer than just a minute or two. Its not that I did not have anything to say, or that I had some kind of brain fart, its that my anxiety decimated me ability to turn ideas into words and sentences. I can usually still talk okay but by talk I just mean my mouth still works. If you ask me a simple question I can usually answer it but I cannot elaborate at all. I have Aspergers and to be honest it sounds more like that. Brain goes into overdrive and shuts down due to too much negative stimulus (eg. an argument or heightened emotions). I also had SM as a child and it is not that I did not know what I wanted to say necessarily, but that I was physically unable to say anything due to crippling anxiety.", "Shocked at the actions of this teacher (CROSSPOST, not OP)  I think if I was the teacher I would have moved her seat so she could not share the white board with her friends. When I taught, we had a \"time out\" table on the wall of the classroom for chatty kids. We would tell them to take their work there. It removed them from the stimulating environment of other kids so they would calm down and focus on their worksheet.\n\nIf she kept drawing, I would give her a short term goal: you must finish X in the next 15 minutes, or you will lose a privilege (no computer time, indoor recess, whatever is coming up in the immediate future that she will feel the loss of immediately). I would even mark on her paper what problems she must do, and depending on age, draw the clock with her time limit to finish her goal. And give her a little pep talk, like, \"I know you can do it if you focus on your work!\" The entire account of what happened is horrifying, especially considering that she acknowledged she knew the child has SM and still took her ability to communicate away. I am glad her husband took a stance against her because she really needs a lesson in humility.", "Your Mom Jokes Do not Work This does not seem like it has to do with SM, but it does. I can only talk to family. It is annoying. If I make your mom jokes, they are like \"Why are you talking about grandma?\" Or whatever. It would be better to someone that is not my family. Another aspect of SM I guess.", "Do you ever have that my disorder is not my personality feeling? Whenever someone has described me as shy, or quiet In person. I get hella offended.

My friends see me as confident, while others the quiet one. \n\nFor example telling an uncle I was listening to a relative say all these offensive things about me over the phone to someone. He is aware of my anxiety and my life story but part of what he said to me included  \u201cshe does not even know you can hear her.  Or do not like it.  Maybe when u feel comfortable you can tell her, like you do with auntie Anna who gets annoying.    Someone with a strong personality like aunt Jane and auntie Jade would tell her off and scream at her. Your other uncle would tell someone off to their face as well. I am scared of People like them (thinks he is a nice guy). If you did do it she would hate you.   But....\u201d I do not remember what else he said. But anyways, I was thinking what even is a strong personality? So is the opposite a weak personality? Is that it.   It made me have this feeling, like I refused to accept that being quiet and withdrawn IS my personality. It is my disorder!\n\nExample 2.   I once had an online fling with a guy from another country. Definitely did not work out after he found a gf. Anwyays I was telling my friend Suzan all about it constantly.  And she knows me quite well.  Back then I once texted her jokingly \u201cI am like cat fishing. I look nothing like this irl.\u201d Then Suzan replies saying \u201cyou look exactly the same. You are pretty.   It is the personality.  You are more confident over text, but in real life \ud83d\ude2c\u201d and that offended me.   I know this and think this about myself, but hearing her message it made me mad. \n\nYou type more than you talk made me mad. Even though I know it can be true, maybe it is because it is an insecurity and hearing someone else (esp the friend that naturally has gotten my skin so many times with her self proclaimed bluntness. Yet she is still the one friend I always end up going to tell about my life problems)   \n\nThis friend has a knack for getting under my skin, for years now. I have told her about my anxiety disorder before btw- I was like YEAH because of my disorder. I can easily be confident around people i trust and told her it depends who I am comfortable with. I told her once or twice and she never remembers how it works, but she does know I have anxiety. \nSo I thought about how I have literally thought the same thing about her. She is an awkward mf, and we have talked about how we relate with feeing awkward. So I am I tell her it is the same with her, and she goes \u201cI talk a lot\u201d.  Yeah more than me to anyone around her, but she is still and awkward mf. \n\nThis was brought up a second time when we planned to meet up and she wrote \u201cand you better be this talkative when I see you tomorrow, or I swear I will kill u\ud83d\ude02\u201d. Or something. Then I got mad and upset, talked about it with someone, then texted her how I felt.  She sent back a lengthy response about how sh*t she feels saying it to someone like me, and that she was joking and bringing up how we talked all the time back in school, plus how the teacher even moved me to another seat back in school, and she is happy I told her because back then I am the past I wouldnt have.\n\nThis same friend once said something like \u201cpersonality cannot be fixed\u201d to me over a similar topic. I was offended, like what does that even mean?!    It made me think did my disorder turn into a personality? Because I do not accept it as my personality. I am not meant to be bottled up! \n\nThere was a time when I texted Susan something about the guy likes to make girls angry.  And Suz messaged me  \u201cI have never seen you angry, even back in school you are never angry\u201d - that made me upset/mad. But I do say I am a very calm and chill person, but I was also thinking excuse me?!  I was thinking to myself - IM ALWAYS ANGRY.  I am constantly angry. On the inside, in my mind.  I wish I could express it so freely like normal people do! Then again, it is not something to admire when in real life people do lose their sht, it is rather annoying.    On a similar topic this friend once messaged me \u201cyou need to learn how to speak up. Do kickboxing, feel strong!\u201d  \nSee this Susan has annoyed me so many times in the past, despite all that she knows me so well and longer than anyone else - maybe that is why I still feel the need to text her about my life to vent/rant and nobody else as much in detail\n\nThird example, another friend of mine, Jas, once messaged me \u201cyou are like me. Quiet in real life, but text a lot on text. Guys from dating apps say to me \u201cyou are really quiet in a real life\u201d.   Well. It is good to have a friend you relate to.  But at the same time it made me feel abit sad/bitter towards being described as \u2018quiet\u2019.  \nThen Jas goes on to add But I feel like I am changing, THAT IS why I send voice messages instead of text. I do not like being introverted\u201d and once randomly told me her ideal best friend and boyfriend is someone that talks more than her, someone confident. Her bestie talks more than her. And that her current date was more on the introverted side.  \nWe are not close, but we act close and want to be considered besties. I wanted to say to her twice: do I not meet your qualifications? Am I not good enough?  Fine?   But I did not.  But whatever.  \n\nI wish I could be the same everywhere I go. \nDoes the tendency to go quiet become a personality trait? Or maybe it is just a mental illness? I have grown out of SM. MAYBE its Selective Quietness.  I made a new friend a while back, who loved me because I was a crazy bitch and still wants to be best friends. She is a loud crazy girl with bipolar. Let us call her Bianca. Even Bianca had said once about me \u201cshe is normally shy, and quiet around everyone else, but with me she is fking retarded\ud83d\ude02\u201d, which made me realise people notice these things. That I wish I could be my crazy self that gives 0 f***s around anyone. \n\nI do not mind being calm by nature. But sometimes I wish I could be the way I see myself in my head - as how I am on the outside and the type of person not scared to constantly speak my mind. In my head I am tough, and I am feisty and a whole lot of sexy. Halfway through or I think but I get it. I am very expressive and outgoing in my mind, but in practice it crumbles. I cannot do it. In a way I feel like the anxiety will win and lead to my eventual end. I feel like the end of my life is soon, not in 50 years, I cannot picture it. Or I at least cannot picture it being much different than it is now, just everyone I care about older and my parents dead.\n\nThe true me is not quiet and awkward, if it was not for this anxiety I think I would be what my mind believes my true self to be, which is outgoing and cool....I guess. I am just pushing away my problems now and no longer letting myself cry, because it does not change anything worth anything if I cry. Although I know I want to, I cannot.\n\nI just relate to music these days and that is about it. School is meh because it is so meaningless in my eyes, same with money, and all this other shit. I am just watching  American,' and it is a great show. That is how I picture my life...though at the same time I want that all, I want to stay by myself forever and ever. I want to die but I do not want to give up on life...though time is passing. 8 years ago and I am the same kid now 8 years later just older and a little smarter, not any more social. \n\nI am just by myself, my old friend texted out of the blue today and I just left it, never opened it. I have not snap chatted my friends in about a month, so yeah....just myself and my own lack of motivation. \n\nMy only excitement is this computer I will be getting in a few days, which really to the same old shit, but I want to do some photoshop and start writing my diary on there again....and write out my life to this point, with 100% honesty. From there, I have no clue.\n\nEdit: I am 18 and I will be 19 in November And it is a shame because I really lead to believing reincarnation is what will happen if I die, so it does not give me any more motivation. I am not religious, that is just what I really believe will happen, if anything.", "A question for those who are as the Subreddit is about, a Selective Mute Currently in my life, I am at the point where I do actually want to talk normally. I have been driven because when I was with my family I basically bumped into the girl of my dreams (not to sound cringe), so ever since then I have been motivated to actually take the steps to talk normally. I am 18.\n\nIn my mind, talking is difficult because of those I know, they have this stigma that I have a hard time speaking (which I do), though I feel as if they did not I would be able to speak, or at least more openly able to speak. For me, it is my family and those who know me and about me that I have a hard time speaking to. I can talk to my friends pretty openly when we hung out and openly on Xbox, although I avoid starting the convo normally and getting too personal on my own accords (last time was in 2019 when we hung out, but yeah)......that is the only real sense of normalcy.\n\nI am admittedly scared to talk, but I feel this stigma is the biggest reason as to why I do not. I think if it did not exist, I could speak today normally or more normally.\n\nI have never been one to reach out to those like me, since in my mind I do not like people like me because I hate it all. So let me know your thoughts on what I am talking about here, I am just trying to grow away from this all as soon as I can. Thank you, and yes I am reaching out now, nothing personal with that first line of the paragraph. What you are describing is the exact same I have felt and sometimes with people I do not see that often my brain is still like: \u201ehey, they know that I used to not talk, cannot change that now!\u201c\n\nAnyways I was able to overcome all that pretty early (started showing symptoms around age 3, age 8 started trying to overcome, age 14 nearly fully recovered, am 18 now too) thanks to the help of my family. The way I did that is by inviting everyone from my class over to me individually starting with the ones I was most comfortable around. We then would go to my room and I would try and force myself to talk, it really was not a pleasant experience but I really wanted to be able to talk to people (some not so much ;)    ). The first person that I invited over is now my best friend and according to my dad, who helped me by being with us in the room and comforting me (as I said I was around 8 at that time), said that this \u201esession\u201c took around 7 hours. We started out in my completely pitch black room as I probably thought that if I cannot see the person I wanted to talk to it would be easier for me to accomplish that. After some time I would be able to answer questions with a pressed out yes or no (let them talk and ask questions and if you feel comfortable enough start with answering with something like \u201emhm\u201c (do not know how else to describe these sounds) or else if you do not feel comfortable enough just nod or shake your head). \n\nFor me I could describe my mutism as doors that were locked in my head and the key was nowhere to be found. So I had to use brute force to open these doors. At the beginning it was a delicate process, like opening a lock with a hairpin: If you have never done it it will take a long time. With some practice you get better at it, you know the approach. After some time you get even faster. You do not care about if the door stays intact anymore and discover that using a sledgehammer to break through the doors is way faster than picking the lock. \nThe hairpin or the sledgehammer is your willpower to talk and the doors are what blocks you to talk to a specific person. When your will to talk gets strong enough you just start to nuke whole hallways of doors in one go, to stick with the metaphor. \nSo, at the beginning depending on how comfortable you are around the person it can take a long time and I can imagine that the older one gets the more difficult it will be, but if you really want to you can do it too! If you really want to I know that you can do it!! I have the same issue if people expect me to not speak it is hard for me overcome that. I have overcome it with some people but not with others, I do not really have any advice though sorry I mostly got over my SM in 8th grade when I changed schools. Nobody knew and everyone expected me to talk, so I talked!  For me it was the expectation that I was not going to talk and the reactions of people saying \" OMG! He talked!\" But I continued in school speaking and by the time I saw some people that DID know about my SM, they seemed to forget about it... Everything was normal, no reactions. I think most people do not care enough about other people to hold onto things like that for very long. I get it. During my recovery I found it was much, much harder to talk to people who knew too. I found that people did not leave space for me to speak because they did not expect that they had to. \n\nMoving away and meeting new people in new situations was super helpful. Without those expectations hanging over me, I was able to improve. When I would go home, I was often shocked at how rude my old friends seemed because they would talk over me so much, even though I could talk now. \n\nEventually, with enough time away from those people, I was able to recover pretty much completely. I found people who I can talk to and even when I have gone back, I have gained the confidence to be able to push back against those expectations. \n\n(As and aside, the friends you meet as an adult are often better friends than the ones you have as a kid just because you live nearby or went to the same school imo.)\n\nI was your age when I moved away from home. I cannot recommend getting out there and finding your voice with new people enough. That was ALWAYS a thought in my mind with it all, if I went to another school I could have done this. For me it is my family right now, and I want to be done with it before I turn 19, the latest. Overly-optimistic, the end of this month as crazy as that may sound but I figure might as well have a goal like that even if I do not accomplish it. Sometimes you just have to take that step and know you are not in any real danger. You might be uncomfortable but you are still fine. Right? Pretty much, yeah. I remember when I was 18 I met this girl at work who was the same age as me. It was not an official introduction, more so I just saw her and admired her. She was absolutely beautiful and she walked right up to this very tall, good looking, outgoing guy which was the complete opposite of me. I remember thinking to myself how lucky he was to to be a magnet to such women and wishing I could experience that even just for a day.\n\nLater on, I kept seeing her everywhere around work and catching glimpses of her. Not in a weird way at all, just taking notice. One day she came up to me and asked if I could watch something for her while she went to to bathroom. I said sure but because I cannot say many words, our conversations usually did not go much further than that. She tried to talk to me a few times, but I just could not speak because of my selective mutism. \n\nI would catch her staring at me when she walked past but I never looked back. Growing up I never could deal with confrontation because I could not carry a conversation. To counteract this, I avoided people as much as possible (even friends) so that we would not speak to one another. She ended up taking offense to this obviously and stopped bothering and even threw me a sort of mean look one day. It crushed me but she is not the first person to do that to me in my life and even other co workers did this to me as well (my fault of course).\n\nI used to drive home thinking about her. How she was the one and how we would live out our lives together. Selective mutism crushed these dreams and I since quit my job. I will probably never hear her feminine voice, see her cute face, or witness her long brown hair again. Sometime last year, my body stopped producing hormones. I no longer feel much of anything anymore. No more happiness, no more anxiety or selective mutism. I only feel apathy and depression. My treatment is injections but I am scared of needles. All the hair fell off the top of my head and I struggle to get out of bed because of the lethargy. The only one I talk to now is a journal because I feel that paper and pen get me the way people never did.\n\nI always prayed to God to cure my selective mutism but it is so unfortunate that this is the price. Sorry for rambling, I just wanted to share because you have selective mutism and you fancied a girl the same age I did haha. Yea I am looking for as much perspective as I can get. Luckily with this girl she does not know much about me...which may or may not be a good thing, in the case I think it was good given the circumstance (more context is in a pinned post). \n\nI think as of now, if I can talk to those I know sooner than later maybe that will be a possibility. Although even if I did talk I still feel that I would not even be able to get her and not that I would not feel confident in myself as such, but that I would still prevent myself from acknowledging to my family that I can actually have feelings towards another person as such....since my Mom had the girl's number I would have to confront her over it.\n\nCurrently I am definitely not in a good state of mind, I was not one to want or long to have a family, but ever since seeing this girl and envisioning it all...I am trying to act like at a Dad at this point, it is weird. Though at the same time those thoughts are sad because it feels like I will never reach them. I will also as of lately I just like to observe everyone and I see couples, but I feel like in a lot of cases these people just settled for someone and I do not want to be that person that settles for a relationship like that, I would rather be alone.\n\nHow is life post-everything? It is all sucky because everything takes time, and I feel as if I had a day which lasted until I started talking that would be great...some nights you will almost be mentally there to maybe start, but then the next day comes.\n\nIt is sort of hard getting everything out there, there is a ton of thoughts lately. Also admittedly I have literally laid in bed all day besides going to the store with my Mom....I just came on Reddit to check if anyone gave anymore insight here, I like Reddit but I feel like it is temporary happiness and I just want to solve my problems IRL before I come back to anything like this, I have not even watched YouTube in a week about.\n\nAnd I will write too about each day, it is nice although I am 2 days behind RN....Might write that now, then get off this. I have fallen \u201cin love\u201d several times to women that had shown interest in me and that I thought were beautiful and kind. But I never made a move and when they did, I ignored it because I could not speak. It is weird how you will go through in your head your entire life with these women but never actually do anything in person even when it is so tangible. That is what this disease does. Post SM I never think about it anymore. It is like when you get sick and it is terrible but when you have recovered you act as if you never were. SM was a humbling experience for years but I have moved on for the most part. The only remnants of it and me lay in this subreddit. I always told myself that when I got cured that I would have a relationship then. Even though I would be infatuated by these women and feel as if my entire life would be pure with them, time passed and we moved out of each other\u2019s lives for one reason or another. We shared a period of time with one another in life\u2019s abundant existence. But that is it. Two passer byers amongst all odds met in a mutual wavelength of light.", "I have a few questions about SM. * 1. - can someone with anxiety and SM have mute episodes when they are happy?\n* 2. - can people have sm because they are shy?\n* 3. - can people who are having mute episodes make sounds like \"aww, hmm, ohh, mhm, etc\"? \n\nreminder I am not SM! I do not know that much about it, I am just trying to educate myself.", "Late mutism I was thinking here and realized I developed SM late. Before last year I do not remember having such big problems to communicate. I mean, I have always been a child who was ashamed to introduce himself to strangers or present jobs in front of the class, but that is due to shyness and fast summing up as soon as I gained confidence. \n\nBut last year I started having serious problems with speech. I could not get the teacher's attention at all, answer when they called me or things like that. \n\nGoogle says That SM is common in childhood and that it goes away after that, but in my case it is the other way around. I did not have SM in childhood (not that I remember) and developed now after my 18th birthday. \n\nDoes anyone else have a similar case? Well, SM does not go away in adulthood unless it is treated. Thus, it is not a \u201cchildhood anxiety disorder\u201d. It is not shyness, so anyone who has it cannot merely \u201coutgrow it\u201d. Second of all, while it is more common for SM to develop/be diagnosed around preschool age, it *is* possible for it to develop later in life. It is also possible you just had very mild SM before and now it is just worsened. Excuse me if I was rude or something, I am new to this world. I will try not to take Google so seriously. \n\nI do not have an official diagnosis of SM, I have spoken to my psychologist and she does not know much about it, so it is possible that maybe in childhood I had a very mild SM or that I really just developed it last year. My apologies if I came off as rude, you did nothing wrong. Misconceptions about SM are very common, unfortunately. It is not hard to have the wrong information about it. Do not worry, I am not good taking the tone of words. \n\nI would like more people to know about SM, spare me certain unpleasant situations. I will list some of the most common myths/misconceptions I have heard. There is definitely a few more I have not mentioned and just are not thinking of at the moment, but I will try my best. I am writing to hopefully help other people who do not have SM as well, so you may or may not already know some of this from your own experience with having it.\n\n**Myth 1: SM is a form of autism.**\n\nWhile people with autism may experience something similar to SM during sensory overload, SM is an anxiety disorder and does not have anything to do with autism. Though it is possible to have both SM and autism, the two are not related. People with autism very often greatly struggle to understand and interpret social cues and body language, while SMers can understand social skills just fine. They just cannot speak. SM is also sometimes mistaken for nonverbal autism, but the two are very different. People with SM are also typically visibly anxious. nonverbal autism stems from something an issue such as motor deficits, while SM does not. People with SM are also usually able (not always, through) to speak at home, while people with nonverbal autism cannot speak in any setting.\n\n**Myth 2: People with SM are being oppositional or defiant.**\n\nA lot of people seem to assume that SM is voluntary, and think that they are merely being oppositional. This often leads to people punishing or yelling at an SM person when they do not speak. But as most SMers already know, that is just not the case, because people with SM do not decide when, where, or who they can speak to. SM stems from severe anxiety, not the want to be controlling or manipulative. \n\n**Myth 3: SM is just shyness. It will be grown out of.**\n\nAs I mentioned before, SM is much more than normal shyness. SM is a frustrating inability to speak which greatly interferes with the sufferers life. People who are merely shy can still get along normally in life, and possibly \u201coutgrow\u201d it. But it is extremely rare for SM to be \u201cgrown out of\u201d. Like most other anxiety disorders, it will need to be treated in order for the sufferer to recover. \n\n**Myth 4: SM is a \u201cchildhood anxiety disorder\u201d**\n\nI did sort of talk about this one before, but I guess I will go more into it here.\n\nHonestly, this is by far the most frustrating one for me, and is also the most common misconception. As a teenager with SM, it is very frustrating to want to help someone understand why I do not speak, and all the articles that are about SM only talk about young children. People with SM cannot merely wave their SM goodbye as soon as they become a teenager or adult.\n\n**Myth 5: People with SM will speak if they are pushed/forced hard enough**\n\nSince SM is involuntary, as well as driven by the pressure of speech, this will simply not work. Often times it just makes the SMer feel so much more anxious, thus making communication that much more impossible. Overtime, attempting to force someone with SM to speak can actually cause regression. I experienced that myself. \n\nThis got long did not it lol. My apologies. Hey, sorry for waiting thirteen days to reply you, I saw the notification, but forgot to click on it.\n\nI am so very thankful for you answer. Now I know a little bit more about myself and my SM. And I know how do you feel about number 5. Is horrible when someone try to make you talk. They do not help, in fact, they just make your voice run way faster.", "do you guys ever get times of not being able to speak all together? (i am new to the whole SM business). i cannot speak to anyone at all outside of 11 close family and friends, but there have been occasional days where i have been unable to speak to like literally anyone - myself or my parents or anything. such as right now :(. is this normal? Most of the times I am fine with talking to people but this happened to me on a cruise. I was getting ready with my family to eat and of course I am excited. I was putting on some flip flops and my mom started yelling at me...im stringent in my ways so I did not take it well so I was flustered the whole night and when we went to a formal dinner we sat with other people and I just did not talk for the whole night then the ppl came to take ours pictures and I really did not want them to be taken but my moms like do it so I litterally started laughing so hard... idk where this story is going but I hope you get the point. Keep in mind im a teen and have had a lot of social work but idk what your situation is and ur age. I don\u00b4t know if this is normal, but I do think it is. From my experience, I had some bad days that speaking with a close one is really hard, comes to the impossible, but I usually can a talk with my family (dad, mom, sister and brother), not the same way but I can say simple things,  maybe not be as happy as I were at the good days but I do can. Note that the experience of SM people can change from people to people.", "Has anyone tried using text-to-speech apps? I have thought about maybe trying one for the situations when I cannot talk but I am worried that I will still freeze up. I am hoping it will be at least a little bit easier than speaking but I do not know. Has anyone tried something like this and had any luck? If so does anyone know a good cheap/free app to test it out? Thanks! I used to use one back when I could not talk to anyone at all. If you do decide to use one make sure that you get a free one. The paid ones are not worth it. Even Google Translate does the job! I have used them before, and found them to be rather nice. Recommend trying it out! I use talk free on android, it is good and pretty customisable, would recommend. For a while I even carried a keyboard with me that could connect to my phone so I could \"speak\" faster. I am actually working on making an app for myself that does text to speech using a cloud service, with recordings of my voice, so that it sounds like me.\n\n~~It is kind of hard to actually motivate myself to work on it though frustratingly enough~~ yeah. only trouble is sometimes people are impatient while you type and move on the convo so your comment is not even relevant anymore, and when you first pull your phone out sometimes people think you are being rude and getting on your phone mid convo. but maybe I just hang out with dicks\n\nI would say it is definitely worth giving a shot, I use tts with my friend a lot cause she gets it and does not sign so yeah. definitely a useful tool, but like anything some people are pricks", "Thoughts of a 17 year old boy with sm. \ud83d\ude1e Does anybody else feel behind because of their anxiety? Everybody else your age is living and loving life while your just getting by. You do not know what you want to do with your life. You do not want to disappoint your family that does not understand a thing about sm. (My dads side of the family is strict because they are Kenyan so they expect straight As) You feel like if you did not have sm your life would be great because you would take the high school classes you wanted to so you could go to college and get your dream job. Your scared to grow up and have responsibilities like paying bills, buying a car and even maintaining the oil. But the worst thing of all is people think they are helping but they only see the one percent, (Facial expressions and stuff like that) but they do not see the other 99% which is your thoughts. (For example, a cute girl talks to you and you panic and stare at the floor like \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41 while they laugh at you and your brain is just like sheudbdkrhegdidk) You also wonder if you have came across \u201cthe one\u201d but could not get to know them because of your anxiety.

Scratch the surface and those perfect images do not stand up - they do not have perfect lives, that is just what they want you to think. Most of them will be insecure about something in their lives, some are just better at hiding it. \n\nAt 17 you feel so grown up, and that you should have your sh*t together. You should not.  You are going to spend the next 5-10 years (yes, YEARS!) growing into yourself, finding out who you are, who you want to be, and finding out how to get there. \nSpend time getting to know yourself, and do not feel like you have to apologise or feel ashamed of being who you are. The world needs diversity, we cannot all be chatty extroverts, us quiet ones are valuable too. \n\nIt took me years to open up to my friends about my introversion,social anxiety &amp; sm. Now they understand that if I turn down plans it is because I am taking care of my mental health, and they respect that.

I hope you have a wonderful day. \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude0e I understand your struggle, I also have selective mutism and I can understand how hard life must be for you.

But right before that we sat for a literal hour in the most awkward and painful silence (mostly because my father refused to leave the room) \"until I was ready to talk\"  \nlike if you know i cannot speak unless comfortable why are you jabbing at me through the air? and she proceeded to do stuff on the computer.  \nWe left in an hour and she said \"maybe next time\"  \ndafuq!  \nhonestly all I want to do is try and speak up to a psychiatrist but they will not even call us back..what is the use? was I even meant out to get help?  \nI seriously kind of hate that woman -\\_- we play \"mental health bingo\" where it literally just lists symptoms of depression like i dont already know !  \nthen we did some anxiety grounding techniques. nyway i dont feel all so anxious around her like impending doom more like i cannot tell her anything. i just cannot. especially w/ my dad around.duuummmbnbnn Damn that rly sucks. Personally I know that would never be able to talk to my therapist if my parents were there. It very much annoys me how some people think they can bully you into talking even though that makes it way worse. I think you should ask for a new therapist. Also tell your mom that you want to talk to then alone next time, but you do not need to tell the exact reason why if your not comfortable For one, you should not have your dad in the therapy session with you. And sounds like this therapist is a bad fit for you. You need to find someone who you can feel comfortable and trust with most importantly. Sitting around in silence will not do anything. Is there any way you can get a different therapist?   \nI go to a community mental health center, and I was able to request a different therapist because mine was not helping me, and I dreaded going -- my current therapist is great.\n\nWith my therapists (and other people), when I am not able to speak, I still can nod my head \"yes\" and shake my head \"no.\"  I am also able to write things down.  \nMaybe you can try non-verbal means of communication with your therapist?  \nYour therapist knows you have selective mutism, so they should be understanding.\n\nYour father should not have been allowed to refuse to leave the room, even if you are a minor.  \nI have been in therapy off and on since I was a child, and I have always been allowed to be in the room with a therapist without my parents (even though my parents did not always like it). It was always easier to communicate with a therapist without my parents with me.  \nTherapists also like to have parents leave the room so they can ask about possible abuse or other issues.\n\nYou do need to have a therapist (social worker or psychologist) before seeing a psychiatrist in most places. \n\nI hope you are able to get the help you want. thanks.. I honestly do not even know if my dad is the problem. I can never say I want him to leave the room and it feels as if he stays just to spy on and ridicule me later.. I always say I do not care and he insists on staying :/ My school set up my therapy once again and he will not take me out of it. I would rather just redo the next time they force me there than to deal w/ this one.. he is made it clear i am wasting his money with the silence I do not know what to do Yeah I know.. i have had a therapist before all they do is play board games, ask about your weekend and force you to sit in silence for an hour as you lie in short responses about how great and sociable you have been.  \nLike my older school they set it up.. the only therapist who was actually alright or cared about their job was from somewhere I guess official. I dunno.  \nIt just feels pretty dumb.. Thank you!  \nYeah.. going to a mental health center was a wasted opportunity as they were the only helpful and \"professional\"? therapist I had.. I do dread it a lot right now..   \nShe gave me a pen and paper to answer a survey which just gave me a few questions about depression..? and then she evaluated right then I had it. decided my issue was isolation. its not at all.. i froze and could not even write something to her. too scared she would read it out loud. I wish she would ask me questions like that I could answer.. but she only asked if I wanted to talk or play a game. I did not answer. we sat in silence :I  \n\n\nMy dad does not really understand.. he thinks there is nothing wrong with me except the fact im antisocial but I like it that way. if i could choose to talk to people I probably would not. He keeps trying to pry for information but I wish he would just stop paying..  \nThe psychiatrist they contacted has not called us back and it is been a few weeks..  \nat this point I think therapy will not help especially like this so I just want to diagnosis. Part of the problem is needing to communicate about what makes you comfortable. I would personally write a letter and say \"this is my barrier to speaking, this is what I need to make that happen, and I need your help to uphold these boundaries so I can talk to you.\" \n\nOne of said boundaries being low pressure and your dad being out of the room. It is not that you do not \\*want\\* to talk, and make that very clear. \n\nI really want to be a therapist some day, and I feel like I would deal with these things so much better than the story after story I hear. I would want at least 15-20 minutes alone with the patient to at least ask yes/no questions like \"do YOU want your family in the room with you\" etc so that they can nod, point at cards with yes/no, etc. It is so important that you have a therapist you can be comfortable with, and sometimes that means them going to bat for you when you need help. From how you write this, I can tell you have a lot of pressure on being able to speak. That is the exact situation that I freeze up in. There is a supportive type of pressure (\"Hey, you can do this! I am rooting for you, you will do so well!\" etc) and there is a suppressing type of pressure (\"If you do not do this, you are just a drain on me, you are such a waste,\" and so on). The first type is helpful. It builds you up.\n\nIf you have someone in your life (especially who you depend on and \\*can\\* not escape at your will), it is very damaging, and it just tears you down. It inhibits your ability to succeed. He is sabotaging you under the guise of trying to motivate you. Aw no, that sounds awful. I would really suggest telling your dad you want a new therapist and you do not like her, and I can see why you hate her honestly with someone with sm myself it sucks but I had therapy for it and it didnt help just made it worse, gradually without therapy for that reason I spoken to more people. Morally I think you should get another therapist or try change your therapy place to somewhere else. Or maybe get a diary and take it with u when your at therapy to write down what you want to say :D hope this helps! i unfortunately know \ud83d\ude2d  \ni heard my mom telling him it was weird but he just disagreed.. I asked him to cancel it aswell and he said the school would just sign me up again bc concerns for my mental health for another year ?:(  \nthey are literally forcing me to be social n no ! yea.. I wanted to be that too.  \nshe gave me paper and tried to understand I guess the first time I could not speak but then just gave up? and I was too nervous to even write anything.  \nI am mute but I do not have any desire to speak with people.. do not really like them and wish I never consented to therapy again..  \nim there for \"isolation when depressed\" but I no longer feel depressed and I like hoarding myself up so I dont have to talk to annoying verbally abusive morons its just a hassle.  \nthey think that is the reason i went idk ty \\^\\^!!!  \nI feel really mean doing that but i did want to punch her in the face the whole time..  \nshe gave me paper to answer some questions but I was so scared to write anything.. i just held up my fingers for some 1-4 how often questions and then she assigned me depression or something.   \nMy school set up this therapist and my dads response to me asking to leave it was \"they will just send you back next year so show them you are okay\"  \num I am not I just h888 it here  \nI kind of always end up with therapists from this kind.. i do not know if that is mean but.. i am very tired of being set up just cause i wont talk to people at school I am honestly very similar, i prefer not being around others at all. However, if that is a lifestyle you want to have in the long run as an adult, it is best to find a career where you can freelance remotely. Website design, programming, etc. You will have to talk to people online, but are not as likely to have a team you need to meet with on the reg. \n\nMaybe it is a good idea to focus energy on planning a path to a future like that, where you can live as you would prefer to live? Yeah thanks..  \nI hope i will get naturally better at talking or atleast try as I age.. whenever necessary and hopefully get whatever job I can manage.  \nalready accepted im a mass failure tbh  \nI have no plans.. only thing I ever want to come to get is a child and maybe somewhere OK to live. do not think i will be able to though.  \nI cannot even get to an interview That is pretty much the problems i have as well, and because of it, i keep winding up in customer service positions where i HAVE to talk to people all day. I have better skills, did computer engineering for a while, but they put me as the main contact for the client, forced me to be in the office every single day, and i burned out HARD. It is much better to freelance where you can set your hours, your limits, work from home, etc, but you need the skills, portfolio, and such to get clients.\n\nHowever, if it is in tech, most of the client contact is over the internet like this. There is a path for you though, if you can manage the work, and all the skills you need for those things are best self-taught. Having worked in IT, I would not trust a tech who only learned in classrooms. You need the discipline to self teach though, or to get yourself to sit down and learn with YouTube, Udemy, Skillshare, etc. yaike.. i dont know  \ni have completely given up on the idea of college n im still in highschool right now with no idea what to do.  \nI just want to work as a cashier or something.. That is so many people, and you have to deal with them yelling all day. I did that a while, and do not think i could be paid enough to go back /shudder  jeez ;( i dont know !  \nwhat is a job you could get being a complete antisocial corpse idiot like me..? I cannot talk and i make mistakes all the time.. i have been working on resumes in school and realized i have done absolutely nothing in life and am even worse than average Go into IT. There is a bunch of different software side things you can do, especially as everything gets pushed to the cloud. If you freelance, there is no boss to report to, you can do everything remotely, client contact over email or chat service, Set your own hours, pay, etc. I wish the services that are available now to learn this stuff were around when i was still in school. I feel like i would not be forced in customer or client facing positions constantly. i honestly wish i knew wat u r saying  \ni have no idea wht any of that stuff is or how i could create/do it or what the purpose is cause ive got 0 starting point Start reading or watching videos about computers, find something you can understand, and just try to grow your base of knowledge. :) Look for things labelled 101 and are about computers, they should explain the basics. You will understand more as you go through them. Then some time, you can understand my comment, and i think that is a pretty great place to start. You can make good money that way and not sacrifice how you want to live. ummm alright ill try tysm", "(Not my vid) Do not know if anyone has seen this. I found this video and it is definately worth a watch. Most relatable video i have ever seen, and also some good advice.  I really liked the playlist someone commented here a week ago too, it had this video in it.\n\n", "Selective mutism transferring to text? I go mute at a certain level of stress, but can generally communicate in other ways. But in some situations, it progresses to the point where I cannot get words through text or even gestures out, because my brain just shuts down the \"making conversation\" part of it or something. For example if I go mute but people are nice about it I can usually write my half of the conversation on paper, but if they keep pushing me to talk or worse, I cannot manage to respond at all. Does this happen to anyone else...?\n\n I would bet some people here are too anxious to post, so this post has a kind of irony to it. I will admit to typing this 3 times lol Yep, I keep trying to post, then giving up. Hopefully not this time.  To add some more to the topic, sm is an *anxiety* disorder, and not talking is just the most glaring symptom of the anxiety. It is easy to overlook other things like your discomfort writing, and the effects on body language, facial expression (frozen face), etc which are also important. Back when I still had SM i could not write, gesture or make facial expressions either when in my anxiety inducing situations,\n\nas theothersophie said, it is an anxiety disorder and even though the only criteria is really \u201ccannot speak in certain situations\u201d it can come with a combination of other symptoms\n\nmultiple studies have shown that children with sm have the same level of anxiety as those with \u2018plain\u2019 social anxiety, with the addition of difficulty talking I really struggle with communicating by writing, even online. I spent a long time trying to find the courage to post this yeah i keep trying to comment and i cannot so this is my first comment on here haha No. Reddit is anonymous. Hit the nail right on the head. If someone is anxiety is severe enough to cause SM, their anxiety is most definitely impacting their life in other ways beyond not speaking out loud. For me, the SM and fear of writing and limited body language was just the tip of the iceberg. Behind the SM was distorted thinking, maladaptive coping mechanisms, avoidance, learned helplessness, suicidality, and other traits typically associated with anxiety disorders.\n Yes, how you explained it...", "I need help. I am at a point in my life where I cannot perform necessary daily tasks anymore without getting sweaty palms, a fluttering heart, and even very slight nervous tremors. It is extremely difficult to have conversations with people at school who I talk to every day, and with new, interesting people I really want to talk to, I cannot say a word. I cannot even talk to my teachers if I need help or want to bring up a great point in class. I know I should start seeing a medical professional before my SM gets worse, because soon I will be in college and on my own. I need to communicate with my guardian that I should speak to my doctor and start seeing a psychiatrist or other mental health care provider, but I am embarrassed and terrified to ask for help. I am scared to even just ask my parent to schedule an appointment, because I do not want to talk about my social anxiety with them at all. I have always been very independent and strong willed to do things on my own, and having a stranger looking deep into my mind and getting paid for it is my literal worst nightmare haha. However, I would much rather talk to someone educated on mental health than my parent who does not understand the science and might make my problem worse by trying to help on their own. I wish with every fiber of my being that I will recover but I cannot do this on my own. Does anyone have any advice for my situation to help me to have a comfortable route to access mental health care, or maybe you have experiences of your own to share that are parallels of my story? I am really scared for my future, and the way things are going now, it is not looking good. Hi, I totally understand! Im 14 with SM too and last year to the beginning of this year I had similar problems like yours although I am homeschooled I understand the fear of going to college must bring to you! I once went to school and hated every moment of it, mainly because some teachers did not understand sm but anyway more to the point therapists do really help I had CBT therapy which is basically helping with stress, anxiety and fears. You can get free therapy by being referred by a doctor or referring yourself which my family had to do. If you are from England I know you can get free counselling called camhs which is for children-teens. At camhs they  make sure your feel comfortable and they do not push you, for me they set small goals like keeping a diary and getting out daily, they also give you work books for anxiety and fears so you can see what is really going on and you do not have to show anyone only the camhs therapist. Id suggest to look into it on the NHS website, I am not sure but you may be able to reffure yourself\n\nSpeaking to an adult really helps a LOT! :) Family always want the best for you no matter what, I know from my experiences that by telling someone your worries and fears makes you feel a ton better and even the adults feel a relief because they know you can go to them for help, that is what adults are there for no matter what age you are always speak to someone! We all have to talk about our worries :)\n\nIf you struggle to get reffured or find a therapist there is some helplines that may help you:\n\nSHOUT, This is a free UK text line where you can tell a therapist about your problems. Go to their website for more info (this is free)\n\nChildline, anyone to the age of 19 can use this website, just make an account and you can email, live chat or ring a therapist for free personally this helped me a lot especially when I do not want to tell anyone my worries\n\nIf you type selective mutism help in google it should come up with plenty of resources for you :)\n\nOML so sorry I have wrote so much haha. But i really really hope you find the help you need :)\n\nPlease feel free to ask me questions or even if you want advice about therapy and stuff i can give you tips from my therapy lesson if you would like. \n\n:) Never went the therapy route myself. But... my guess is if I had they would just've told me to put myself out there more. Do you think you could manage controlled regular interactions? Every day make time to step out of your comfort zone, that sound doable? Thank you so much this is so insightful! I will definitely try some of these things, but I am from the US so it might be a bit of a different process for some things. I suppose I could start trying that, thanks for your reply! No problem. I am going to keep talking tho', feel free to ignore me of it is not useful. You are familiar with PTSD? I know of it but I do not have it Of course not, but it is similar in that your sympathetic nervous system is being tripped at inappropriate times. In cognitive behavioral therap(I think that is the right one), they expose suffers a PTSD to simulations of the events that triggered their conditions. Thorough this process they can begin to rewire the brain, write over the bad code with new, undamaged software. \n\nYour brain needs to be rewarded for engaging, instead of you internalizing the negative emotions you receive from every engagement with your peers.\n\n Interesting. I will have to talk to a professional but I will keep this all in mind. Thanks for the info!", "What do people talk about? I can talk on and om about work, but instant anxiety when the topic is about anything else so I freeze out and do not/cannot speak. \n\nI think it is because I do not have enough knowledge on whatever topic they are talking about. I have no interest in sports or athletics, no true hobbies, I spend most of my free time by myself, and I have a habit of hijacking and making most conversations about myself. \n\nI am now tasked with a \"relaxed\" social event with my colleagues and I have to go, but we are not supposed to be talking about work. \n\nWhat do I talk about if I feel like I know nothing? It is very relatable for me.\n\n I read books and watched documentaries( in which I was interested in) so I can have something to talk about.\nGet some knowledge on anything you are interested in and start a hobby.. you may have to force yourself a bit.... and I could not Force myself to do something I do not like, just so I can fit in and have something to talk about. Just get more knowledge about things you are interested in \nIt got better for me I was like this too. At first I could not talk at all growing up. Then it progressed to only talking about exactly what someone asked me.\n\n\u201cHow is your day going?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\nAnd that was it for years. My mind would go blank and I just could not keep up in a conversation. You do not have to have hobbies. You do not have to be a badass either. You are human and you can talk about anything. You just need to relax. It will come to you but only if you let it. Stop fighting it!", "why do people treat selective mutism and their minor anxiety as they are similar in any way? i swear to god its so annoying for people to explain that i cant speak and then have someone be like \"oh i used to be shy. i was so quiet!! come on you just have to try!!\" like its not the same. you having to go up on stage and feeling a bit nervous or not talking much to someone you just met isnt the same as me being physically unable to talk due to anxiety and barely being able to communicate properly as well. i cant even nod my head to someones question sometimes. its not the same and im sick of people acting as if they are like they are magically going to fix my disorder by telling me to try more.", "I dont know if this is my autism or not. I need help. So without going too far into detail of my personal life, I have been finding myself getting more and more tired of just talking. I wrote a post about how I might be becoming a non verbal autistic rather then what I am now (fully verbal). I made a post on another subreddit but someone suggested I check this subreddit out. \n\nBut I dont know what selective mutism is. I just know that I am starting to get tired talking with people, my depression restarted, I dont want to talk with anybody anymore. Help.  Selective mutism is less about not wanting to talk to people and more about not being able to talk, even if you really want to because of anxiety. It is not called selective because you select or choose not to talk. Instead it only happens in select situations eg someone with SM might be able to talk fine at home, but not be able to talk at school, or they might have a few people they can talk to, while everyone else they cannot. \n\nWhen I had SM my mouth would lock up, even if I tried to say something to a friend. I did not want to be silent, but I could not physically make myself speak. It felt awful, on the edge of panic, but frozen with fear. \n\nIt sounds like you need help with depression. Withdrawing from social ties can be a symptom of depression. Right now is a super stressful time and it is not strange to be going through some mental health struggles. If there are telehealth services or online counselling in your country, you could reach out for help. Try not to let the problem get worse, if you can. Asking for help is ok.

When I try to talk in lessons, I cannot open my mouth or even if I manage to open the words will not come out. My heartbeat goes crazy. Even when I think about it, outside or inside of the school, I get nervous. In classes, when the teacher says my name, I lie about my voice or throat. I say that my throat hurts to my friend and she says it to teacher. It is been 3-4 times. I feel like they will understand I am pretending. I do not want to go to school anymore. I get great fear even thinking about classes.\nLike I mentioned, it is never happened to me before. Not even in the first or second year of the highschool. I was very confident and my voice was so clear back then.\nAlso, even if I change my seat, I still cannot talk. It is not because I am shy. I am not shy at all. I am also a social person.\nHow can I dealt with it? Should I go to school counselor because of this? I need to get this off my chest. (I talked with my parents about this. My father said that he would understand that if it happened to a middle schooler. It disturbed me how negative their reaction is so I did not talk about it again.) What changed that made you so anxious now when you were not before? The counsellor will likely also ask you about the root of the problem. I would say, maybe change of the environment? I used to have lots of friends in my old class. I have no friends in my new one. So I do not talk with anyone. You could ask your counsellor to switch classes.", "Is there a cure?

Hated doing this as a kid and even as an adult in college it makes me uncomfortable lol. i remember i was ok with raising my hand for things like that..though if i were to raise my hand to verbally answer a question or something like that, my hand would shake terribly..

But I cannot find any jobs that dont require talking. I cannot drive a car because every time I get behind the wheel I get very anxious, and get concerned that I could kill someone with the vehicle, I can have my parents drive me places sometimes if I am lucky. I also cannot work from home because I live in Canada and Canada is famous for crappy WIFI. I also have a tough time talking on the phone to strangers. What job does anyone think is best, I need a job that I can start right away. I hate how there is no comments and barely any reach. I have the same issue, I know what you are going through. I am, personally, working on starting an Etsy business. I have been looking for chat support jobs. I used to do phone support and have about 8 years total in various customer service and support positions, so it is just going from phones to chats instead as I do not have problems understanding a chat. I would have said online, becuase one of my jobs is online transcribing. I do not speak to anyone for it, not even when applying. I do not make enough to support me though so looking for another part time hourly job. Also online would take care of needing to be driven somewhere regularly. Becuase mass transit is not everywhere. And special transit provided by local authorities will not take you to a regular job \\, only to doctors or shopping occasionally. \n\nYou will need to set yourself up for now and for later in life, when your parents will not be able to drive you. You will probably need to move to somewhere that has some transit and/or is in walking distance to where jobs are, if you are not in a big enough area right now.\n\n You can always find and start a service type job -right away- \\, but you would need to talk- less on a phone, than in person and they are lower paying. You might be able to find one where you do not have to talk a lot to coworkers or customers, or can write your responses down to people on a note pad type of thing. Like an overnight stocker or janitorial. \n\nIn the US if you need a service animal the law requires most businesses to allow it, but there are restrictions and hoops to jump through for you and the dog. You should find out what the laws on disability in the workplace and service dogs are in Canada before applying to any jobs, or starting any education towards a specific type of career, even if you do not have a service dog yet. And I think you would have to tell a job you will be getting a service dog if you are offered that job. But I do not have a service dog, so I am not sure.\n\nFor the long term, I think you could go into a number of different fields with a service dog. And needing a service dog would probably be more of a hindrance than not being able to talk on the phone. As most work communication is email, and in person now. My last few jobs I only used the phone at/for work when calling in sick for a day. Or in the interviewing process. \n\nYou can see if your high school\\ has a guidance counselor, or sometimes they are called career counselors?,  who might be able to help you find a job, or resources on disability laws in workplaces. If you have a social worker they might be able to also. If you are seeing a doctor or someone to get a service dog, they might have information also. In the US there are sometimes local employment centers that help place people in jobs, these are from the local government-- not job agencies or temp agencies. Usually they are state and not federal run.\n\nRight now is a good time to look online at job board websites as there are a lot of new opening since things are opening back up after the pandemic. Unfortunately there is no filter for less speaking or disability friendly jobs. There is usually a filter for entry level, though. You can also see signs posted in front of, on the door, or just inside local businesses in a lot of places. Ugh this is exactly my issue. I am not functioning and I feel like trash because I am in such a bad mental state and cannot do a lot of things myself. I cannot get my license because I have panic disorder and freeze in place sometimes at random times and it lasts for around 30-40 minutes. I do not think it is a good idea because there is such a high chance of freezing in the middle of driving and potentially putting myself and others in danger so I am holding off on that for now. The SM is really debilitating when practically everything in the workforce is not very forgiving with it. I am 17 and need a job but I seriously cannot speak.", "Has anyone else ever had problems with pent up frustration? I know a symptom of having selective mutism is you do not usually know how to self-soothe or self-regulate your emotions when you are younger. I was always a super angry kid and I honestly did not know why until I connected it to my selective mutism. I am not angry anymore and have learned to chill out, but now I am wondering if that is a common thing with SM or if it was just me. I know when I was younger, after being in school all day unable to speak my mind/emotions, I would come home and they would all just explode. Especially because spending the whole day outside of my home with SM was really tiring.\n\nDefinitely a common part of SM. I would say so, you have no idea how many times a therapist would label me with anger issues or try to convince my parents that it was a defiance issue that required me to be disciplined. All that did was frustrate me more, hence be even more temperamental! you are definitely not alone there. i was also super angry when i was younger. everyone around me simply chalked it up to being because of hormones or me just being defiant, but it was really my SM the whole time. i did not want to be angry, i did not know why i was angry, and i most definitely was not doing it on purpose. thankfully i am not like that anymore, but i do occasionally have days where it is hard to control. not being able to express myself verbally gets so frustrating at times. Had aggressivee tendencies as a kid too, but after a lot of therapy and learning about myself i became one of the most calm persons in my friends circle.\n\nBut yeah, I had a lot of frustration when thing did not go my way, especcially if ot was unfair in my eyes or I did not succeed in areas I was usually good in. A temoer tantrum would follow for a like a minute but then I would cool down again Definitely was very angry as a kid. Not being able to express yourself (or feel like you have the right to, or that people will laugh or misunderstand) will have that impact after some time. I still struggle with anger when I feel like I am not being heard or understood", "How my selectively mute professor met his wife! I am studying computer science and had my baby girl in foundation year. She is 5 now and has random episodes of selective mutism. \n\nWhen she first got diagnosed (she was about 3) I decided to take an elective psych course in child development.\n\nThe course\u2019s professors was severely selectively mute until he was about 23, it is not as severe anymore but still happens to him every once in a while. He was telling us the story about how he met his wife in high school, and it is such a sweet story. \n\nHe was 17 (really bullied) and his now wife just moved to his school. They got partnered in one of the courses and started asking him questions but could not answer her so he started fidgeting with his stuff. \n\nFinally, one of the other kids announced \u201cforget it, you are stuck with the weird one\u201d. So she yells at him \u201coh yeah?!?! And what does that make you, you piece of shit!!!\u201d and she got detention. \n\nShe later heads to the guidance counselor and asks more about his deal and he tells her that he is diagnosed with selective mutism. He offers to talk to the teacher so they could be given individual assignments because it would be \u201chard\u201d to work with him. She declined his offer telling him \u201cwhy?! He can write!\u201d Very cute story. &lt;3 Very cool story.  I have a 7 yo that was diagnosed with SM when he was 5- would not talk at all at school.  He was put on Prozac and within days was chatting away at school and has been on meds ever since because without it he goes quiet again. It makes me wonder if SM is really just severe social anxiety.  I have SA, and I have been in social situations when I have trouble articulating what I really want to say. I cannot seem to think of the right words, it is like my brain shuts down.  It seems like SM just takes it one step further and words do not come at all. selective mutism is the most extreme form of social anxiety Although this is a cute story and it ended up working out, it seems a little weird that the counselor would just give out private information about him to another student like that along with avoidant personality disorder imo, which is what I think my SM has lead to.", "Just a SM aspie looking for friends!

I would be happy to answer any questions you may have or offer advice growing up with SM/anxiety. -Jamie", "I was forced to talk to my Mom about SM, so writing down my thoughts. Desires of the now, I guess I realized again tonight after my Mom forcefully talked to me for 3 hours. If I wanted to try to speak, eventually I could. Or at least speak to her in time. As much as that is ironic because the person it is hardest for to understand it all, is her; it is hard for her to understand that I do have the ability to be able to speak (I do have the ability to break that mental block); she does not see that. She does not see me breaking that mental block without the use of SSRI medicines. \n\nShe also wants to tear down a wall in the room I reside in, which idc about wall necessarily.....but I do care. I care because if I want to eventually play the new Xbox Series X in this room and start socializing on there with friends again, I NEED that wall there...or else talking will not commence. I will stay mute if they have the ability to hear me that clearly, and I will probably avoid gaming entirely if they can see me doing it. I have Contamination OCD to not sleep in my room, or ever really go in there besides changing and playing Xbox (which is rare).....but once I get the new Xbox Series X (and this was always my plan since before it released), I wanted to play it on the 4K HDR TV in the room I reside in, no matter what.......but my Mom focuses on trying to solve both of my problems........but you cannot solve both problems; not at the same time. She does not give my OCD much credit, she thinks it is unreasonable...but to me it is anything but unreasonable.\n\nIf she tears down that wall, kiss my own avenue (only one atm) to speaking to friends, or friends all-together goodbye, I would have to find something entirely new, and new friends because if I never play Xbox again, I will probably never talk to them again. For speaking, she just focuses on getting me to somehow get onto medication, but I do not want to. It is redundant. \n\nI have no motivation to speak anywhere else besides on Xbox (and it is not even motivation on Xbox), even when I did speak in the Xbox Live parties with my friends (that speaking ability translated to IRL, naturally...). Idk, why? With them it seemed like my SM really just disappeared; although it was still there in ways, just not really as strong as anywhere else. It also did not feel like 'fighting my SM'.....it just basically did not exist there. So as much as I was \"changing my SM there\"......change never translated to anywhere else. Yes, I could speak to those friends, but at the same instance when I tried to order food while out with them (and I only ever ordered sodas to keep it minimal).....They once had to order it for me, as the Taco Bell lady could not understand me. That friend is a real G. They are all maybe not super-understanding (in the literal sense), but they do not really care to knock whatever they may think is up with me. I will never forget the people who have stepped in over the years.\n\nAnd I would have much rather played Wizard101's new Update (Lemuria) tonight, instead of thinking about this or talking to my Mom....and whenever I talk to my mom, she can never perceive what I say to her correctly. She perceives it how she wants to, and I cannot change that.....because as much as I can talk to her, I cannot talk to her in any way that would be effective......beyond what I do; which is minimal.\n\nAnd I want her to stop focusing on the medicine, I want her to just focus on me eventually talking. And I do not want to focus on talking, I would rather avoid it....but if I am not pushing myself, they have to push me. I want to talk to my family first. For her to push this goal of me 'picking-up food'....that annoys me, because to me talking to my family is more prominent. And I hate picking up food, it is more difficult because I KNOW my family KNOWS I am going to do it, while I am out doing it.....as it is something I specifically am told to go do.....(if I want to do it), and they are specifically aware of me doing it.\n\nWhich in the summer I did want to pick up food, and I did do it. Though it is still hard to talk to those people.....but if I could talk to my family, I feel like it would be less tolling on me to go out and pick-up food, since one side of it all would be closed off.\n\nI have a lot of thoughts, and I probably missed a few, but it is hard to remember. But I want that Xbox and the room to play it in without worry. I think, \"maybe something will come from it\".....and I am MUCH more afraid/mad at/of the inability to play that Xbox (for the purpose of having some avenue to more properly communicate).....than not being able to play the Xbox (for games, the games are not as important). Although I would love to play Call of Duty again (first one was BO2), but my internet always sucked, so I could never get too serious.\n\nMaybe I will have to tell her that about the wall, and about the Xbox....BUT then she tries to make it about the room and my OCD there....she tries to fix me everywhere, when it is just damaging me in both areas by doing so. If she knocks down this wall, I will probably not play Xbox for.....until we move.....which will probably never happen, or until I get my own place, which if I do not learn how to communicate, will probably never happen. I KNOW everything and how everything affects me, I guess me being \"unbothered\" by the circumstance of my life, is incomprehensible to my Mom, but it is just the way it is........unless I want to break down everyday; you sort of have to be unbothered...or at least try to be. I am bothered, I just cannot be or I will be a wreck. I hate the things I cannot do, and at the same time I am afraid to do those things.\n\nI do have an Xbox One in my room, and I will play that in my room still, but it is quieter restrictive talking because people can hear me through the door....and the OCD keeps me very stuck to the chair in my room (literally), and not much of anywhere besides that chair. Also my Xbox One has been basically a broken/dead console (mine in particular) for the last 3 years, and I play so infrequently now, I have to sit up there for 3 hours just updating every time, and sitting in that room makes me feel SO TRAPPED. I hate it so fucking much, and that is why I avoid it. That room is where my OCD started from, I remember back in 6th grade I would just have to check out the door like 5 times in a row....that was nothing from where it stands now. In time I stopped having to check out that door. Now it is not a simple; having to do something over and over and over again to make sure it is correct in your mind....\n\nThis OCD though, I am more afraid of it getting worse, than anything. I just find that room VERY uncomfortable, and I do not like staying in it. As it is now, I find it abhorrent to be in that room for longer than I need to be.\n\nIt sucks complete asshole, that I cannot get an Xbox Series X. I wanted it that first christmas, and now it is the second one....and you still cannot get it. I would be willing to spend the money to get one off Ebay, but it would have to be my money, and I only have so much, once it is out it is out....and as much as it is unrealistic now, I kind of want some in there, so I could just ditch everybody and take my money and run, although I would never do that..........if I could have some sort of income, I would spend the money, I would get a Scuf or Elite controller too, and a new Headset cause this Turtle Beach hurts my head...some Astros. Probably the elite controller for everything. Money means nothing to me, but I do not want to be stuck without it....although really I have no access to my money, because my mom is the one who set up my bank account password, I never bothered (at 18, 19 now....she is a on there as a secondary...I would prefer she was not. I do not trust her). And again no income so as much as I do not care, I also do not care to completely deplete my money....\n\nMaybe I would get the Xbox Series S, but it performs worse, and for the money you could get the X....I also already have 2 discs for the Series X....so it is a conundrum, and eventually I would want the X for the superior performance. If the performance of each console was identical, I would just go for the S....I would ALSO, get a 120HZ 4K monitor with low response time....but that is my perfect set-up, which I have never had.\n\nI have more thoughts and I said that already, but I cannot think of them. I want to go back to playing Wizard101 now. Thank you. Though I have to write this down, otherwise...it is for nothing. And it calms me down better when all my Mom talks of is this dystopian future I will live if I continue (NO FUCKING SHIT.......I am well aware)........god damn. Just spent from 7:30pm to 10:46pm focusing on this....that is annoying, but idk. It is the only time I think about it. \n\nIt would be easy to just flip the screen at my Mom and show her this, but I also do not want to potentially die inside. But these are my desires, I guess.....not the life-long desires, but the now desires.", "why is it so hard to pick up new hobbies? like i want to do so much, like learning an instrument/going to music school and starting to do sports, but i am scared to do it. i feel like if there is even one person there, who i feel dislikes me, i cannot be myself around anyone there, bc he/she would make fun of me. and then it is like a domino effect: i do not talk -&gt; they think im weird and make fun of me -&gt; im even more scared to talk. Not very helpful but my best advice is just do it. You are thinking of one of the worst case scenarios. Understand that it is probably not going to happen like that, and even if it does, what is going to happen? They think you are weird? Personally I do not think that is very bad. Even if it is that bad, you can drop out of any class and you get to say that you tried! Just remember most people are worried about how YOU view them. They are so preoccupied by this that they do not even notice anyone or anything else", "Doea this sould like Selective Mutism? I am a 25 year old male and in the past 3 or 4 years it has has been really hard to talk to in public and sometimes even in 1 on 1 situations. When I check out at a store for something I say about 4 words to the cashier for the sake of not being rude and give most people very short answers.\nAs a kid I did not talk much being known as the quiet kid at school, in kindergarten a teacher called my mom saying I was making strange sounds and the school though I was extremely autistic because I did not socialise much in reality I felt stressed.\nIn middle school I talked a bit more and in high school I could talk to most people but still quiet and if I met someone new it was because they started the conversation and could be comfortable at parties even though I only talked to no more than 5 or so people.\nThis past 4th of July I only talked to about 5 people with conversations no longer than 5 min.  if someone new or someone I have not seen in a while talked to me I could not find something to say, hoping they would say something first, if I could find something to say I would but just so I would not seem awkward or like an ass hole. And today I came to the shop I glass blowing at for work and there was a few people there and I said hello but did not really say much els. A friend or brother of one of the shop mates came by and I have never met him, I ended up not saying a single word and felt anxious when they left I said \"have a good day\" to the shop mate and gave him a fist bump and then I looked at this freind/brother and gave him a fist bump but did not say anything. \nDo you think this is SM or something else and thank you for reading. I think you should speak to a therapist, but my instinct is this does not appear to be SM, but could be social anxiety. The reason I say so is SM tends to be less adaptable than you seem to be, e.g. having conversations with new people even if they are awkward is something out of reach for most SM people.\n\nBesides that part your experience shares a lot with mine though, and I did turn out to be autistic, so I definitely think it is worth talking to a professional if only to know for sure. Hi, I think you should definitely talk to a doctor or therapist maybe by email, text or app because I do not think this is selective mutism but It may be early signs of it so it is just best to double check! \n\nI think this may be  anxiety because anxiety is different with everyone and affects people in all sorts of different ways, you can take anxiety tests online but that is not a diagnosis. To get a diagnosis you need to go to a doctor or therapist, and I fully understand if this is a hard thing to do but it is worth it in the long run. I wish you the very best :) I agree with the other comments. I think you should go see a therapist to find out for sure. But in my opinion it sounds like social anxiety, not selective mutism. The fact you were able to talk to a lot of people in highschool, and even to some people in middle school would be pretty rare for people with SM. You are also able to make a good amount of friends, talk briefly to most strangers, and get invited to parties. This tells me that your condition does not impare your ability to speak, it just makes you very anxious.\n\nFor people with SM the mere act of talking is usually impossible. Even if you have something to say or can add to the conversation, it feels like there is something blocking your throat. People will rarely hear your voice, and everytime you speak people will make a big deal because they do not know how you sound like. This means that you will probably have very few friends, if any, and can only speak once you fully trust them.", "SM When Speaking A Different Language / Any Tips or Advice? Hi! \n\nI had never heard of selective mutism until yesterday when I was watching a documentary on anxiety and they touched upon it.\n\nIt kind of clicked in my mind!\n\nI am latin and moved to the states at the age of 5. I learned English here and now consider English my 'first language' simply because it is the language I think in and the one I have more control over from school and peers. It is also where I feel my personality comes out the best as my sense of humor does not translate in Spanish.\n\nMy Spanish was only with my parents and family but I do not know when or why I just started freezing up in Spanish. I think it started happening more around the age of 8 or 9.\n\nIt is like, I have one personality in English, but extremely tense and awkward in Spanish.\n\nWhen someone who is not my parents speaks to me in Spanish, I have a hard time talking to them, I tense up. If I am at a family event and it is all spanish, I cannot participate in group discussion, my mind is just blank. Like I have thoughts and opinions in English but cannot find the way to communicate them in spanish and the social anxiety I had as a kid is back. I become very aware of my entire body.\n\nHas anyone dealt with anything like this? Do you have any tips or advice for me? \n\nI am fluent in Spanish, I just do not know why I cannot have group conversations like I can in English. The human brain is the weirdest thing! I came to france as a child and immediately on the first day at school I shut down for the next 9 years of my young life. Since I very soon understood french perfectly that was not the issue at all, I just could not stand the pressure I put on myself of wanting to have a perfectly native french accent from the get to. And since that was not the case, and was not possible at all, my brain just commanded me to not talk at all.\n\nAt 18 years old I started working (I still have no idea how I landed the job other than half of the interview was in english, a language I somehow did not mind speaking) and from then on I started socializing and talking in french for the first time.  \nNow I am almost 32, and yet, I still have a fondamental problem with speaking French. And also being in France and especially in the region of France where I grew up.  \nI immediately get insanely self conscious when having to speak french, I stumble on my words, I get somewhat of a stutter on certain words I deem difficult to pronounce, and of course I have a small accent since I never spoke a lot of French.  \n\n\nSo all that to say that, when I speak french or am back in France, I return to my old teenage self who could not speak and was afraid of people. It is terrible that I am altogether a new person, but I am brought back to an uncomfortable state when my brain connects to what initially made me uncomfortable.   \nI do not have any concise advice for you, other than therapy, meditation, energy healers (not to be dismissed, they can do tremendous work on blockages that therapists can take decades to unfold!), positive affirmations on youtube (there is so many and I do see progress when I listen to them overnight!). I am also on the point of taking elocution classes, to help me gain confidence in my French pronunciation. I think that will help tremendously!  \nHaving a professional helping you to get to a point where you are comfortable with speaking that specific language is always a good idea, plus you might even become better that average at speaking clearly in Spanish ;)", "\"I am not scary.

I can be bipolar-ish I suppose. Sometimes I am super outgoing, then sometimes I crash, and am scared to come out of my room because I might have to engage with someone. That is where I am at right now. My sister And her new husband and their 6 kids came over, and I do not want them to see me like this. They expect me to be fun, but I am not right now. All I got is one word answers looking at the ground for today.\n\nI am just at my parents house and saw some old pictures of me as a kid, and it got me thinking about it. I was not smiling, and I am just wondering now what is going on??? Why was I like that? What is this thing? Has science figured anything out besides cbt crap? Honestly it is pretty complex. Science will not have the answers and CBT is only one of a variety of therapy styles to help people cope from problems like this. If it is affecting your life to a great degree;  then the best course of action would to see a clinical psychologist/psychiatrist to get a diagnosis for any disorders you might (emphasis on might) have.\n\nAs for why you were like that, I would not know. When I was a kid I was SM too. It stemmed from relentless bullying and not being able to express my emotions. I got an official diagnosis of having autism and that is how I learned of my SM. I still suffer from it, but I have developed coping in the forms of learning ASL to still have the ability to communicate and mood stabilizers (for some other things). I still have a lot of lapses though.\n\nLapsing with SM is a bitch, especially with family or friends. You got this though. Kick SM in it is ass! So lapsing is a thing? That must be it then.

My parents kept asking me why I was crying and  I could never explain it. Me and my brother always liked that movie a lot but I cannot remember if that was part of why or not, it is been so long.

Recently, with no apparent trigger, symptoms got worse and in a matter of a few weeks developed other symptoms, in this order:\n- Refusal to sit on toilet, leading to re-diapering even though previously potty trained\n- Refusal to eat solid foods at all (going on for two weeks now). Physical causes ruled out by hospital.\n- Refusal to walk outside the house (wants to be carried), and now refuses to walk even inside the house\n- Refuses leaving the house\n\nAny ideas about what is going on? All anxiety related? Any tips on how to break through and at least solve the most urgent concerns (ie. eating)? Any similar cases or stories? Please and thanks. This *might* be autism. Have you talked to your local GP about it? Do they talk to any of their friends? Yes, we have 4 doctors (1 Pediatrician, 1 family doctors and 2 psychologists) involved. Still very recent and new, though, so I am not ruling out anything. Child does not speak to any friends, but I thought this was due to the selective mutism? Any suggestions on how to differentiate between SM or something bigger? I am not a doctor so I do not want to give any unhelpful advice. I would recommend getting a formal diagnosis. Ask your doctors about autism and see what they think. \n\nAs for the selective mutism, ask your doctors if they know what it is. If they do not, I can send you some information about it so you can share it with them. If he is refusing to walk--maybe carry him around in an ego carrier and give him some space to just exist in your space without expectation. Offer him semi solid foods along with whatever you are currently giving him without urging him to eat anything in particular.\n\nSometimes a trigger is not apparent, especially if the observer is not ND themselves.

It gets easier! Thanks - I appreciate your time to answer. I will probe the doctors about autism. Thanks! This is helpful advice. Appreciate it I do not think it is related to my SM, but it is been probably 3-4 years since I have sat on the toilet without taking a shower after. Thankfully I do not have to sit on the toilet besides when it is solid.\n\nI am generally good but with certain things I am a complete germaphobe.\n\nEdit: Idk if this is helpful info, but yeah That is an interesting comment, thanks.

So I am considering taking some community college classes after a few years of menial jobs and a GED, the only thing that is preventing me from taking classes are the unavoidable speaking/discussion aspects that come with most classes. I am unable to talk to strangers coherently, and I would probably pass out if I had to give a presentation or do a group project. This will probably go better if I slowly eased myself into a classroom environment again, and maybe then I would be able to be a productive member of discussions. \n\nSo are there any types of classes that do not either require or pressure students into those types of things? Is it possible to contact professors beforehand and let them know you have this issue (without any type of formal diagnosis)? Any advice for navigating college while non-verbal? maybe consider taking an online only class? the only \u201ctalking\u201d that is done from what i remember taking one last year was through discussion board posts which are just responding to others through typing! good luck! Definitely consider online and for in person get your disability documented and figure out what sort of accommodations you need in class. As in, how you can communicate in lieu of speaking. \n\nOften for example, you need to participate in some way for part of your grade. If you can not verbally participate as required, will you instead fulfill your participation requirements through text using  your computer in a live chat program or through email?\n\nYour school should have a disability office to help you navigate these issues. Like I mentioned above, make sure your disability is documented by a doctor already to assist in the process.", "Does my boyfriend have SM? I (17) myself, am a very social person. I NEED to talk to people. My boyfriend (17) is the opposite. Social situations make him super uncomfortable and he just sits in a corner. He only talks when talked to, and it is almost always just one word. He is not like this with me or close friends, but everyone else (including his family) gets the \u201ccold shoulder\u201d from him. The only time he says he physically cannot talk is when we get into arguments. I see his lips tremble as if he is trying very hard to get words out. This has caused a lot of problems in our relationship because I really like open communication. I just recently found out what selective mutism is and want to know more about to help him with it. (If he has it.) Sure sounds like it. When you are out among people that sounds a bit more like social anxiety leaving him nothing to say but his state when you argue sounds exactly like SM, the feeling like words will not come out and physically trembling due to the stress is something I was familiar with when discussions turned somewhat more intense Could SM be caused by trauma? He was physically abused by his dad for six years, and he does the same thing around him, but all of the time. He likely does have it from the sounds of it. To help him feel more comfortable, you first must understand that selective mutism is NOT a conscious, voluntary choice. A lot of the time, people with SM actually *want* to speak, but they just cannot. So when he is in situations/settings where he cannot speak, try asking yes/no questions, or questions that only require a one word response. It might require a little thinking on how to reword it beforehand. \n\nAnd open communication is still very possible, but it may not always be able to happen in person. Instead, how about texting? Often SMers are much much more comfortable with texting, so it is worth a try. \n\nI would also try to get him to try to find a psychologist that knows how to treat SM. SM is possible to completely recover from. It absolutely can, especially if just being around his dad triggers that response. The best way to help would probably be to look into professional therapies, in regards to your relationship just be prepared to have to endure silence. Sit with him and let the stress wash through and out, this can be tough without therapeutic techniques like breath control and may take a while at first. I found a short burst of relatively intense physical exercise can help clear the dam so to speak, as well as sometimes writing down important things he would like to say, although funny enough that can be blocked too by SM I am recovered SM, and honestly that sounds a lot like me now. It certainly could be SM, but it could also just be severe social anxiety/general anxiety. I do not speak unless spoken to in most large group settings like a party or conference. I also clam up when my wife and I argue. I could not tell you if it is the SM or just anxiety in general, and honestly I have no idea where one ends and the other begins...it is such a gray area. Either way, I can relate to his situation, so I would say do not pressure him in situations where he is not talking, because it only escalates the issue. Encourage him and support him, but try not to get angry or frustrated or impatient. It is worth encouraging him to talk to a doctor, because the right kinds of treatment and therapy can help - I am a living example of that. I  act very much like him but I consider myself \"recovered\". I guess I am stuck in my old ways. I actually do not experience very much anxiety at all nowadays. I am just a very weird, very quiet person, stuck in the same habits as when I did have SM. So your boyfriend does not necessarily have an anxiety disorder, or he might, but it might not be SM. He could be like me and to put it kind of crudely, just be a person who lacks social skills. I do not think so. He can still talk, not sm Being able to talk in moderation does not make someone automatically not have SM. It is possible to have low profile SM, which is where they can speak in moderation. They can usually only speak when prompted, but otherwise the words get \u201cstuck\u201d. \n\nI would know, I used to be like that, and know a lot of people with SM who are the same way. There is no indication in the post anywhere that he cannot talk to at least one person. Socially awkard/anxious or introverts do not usually initiate conversation, that does not make every introvert sm. But there *is* indication that he is actively trying to speak, and the words do not come out, which would be SM. You are right, I did not fully read the post. I am probably salty that I have it worse than others and they are given the same label as me, despite me telling myself I do not want to got better. Sounds like severe social anxiety ! I understand. If you think about it, anxiety (and other disorders for that matter) does effect everyone differently, so of course no person with SM will have the same symptoms, thus it ends up being that some are able to speak just a little, while others are not able to speak at all. It is sort of a spectrum. I (30) just posted a very similar question regarding my bf (31). I always thought he had extreme introverted ness/shyness around others but following an argument last night he still has not spoke. We have had a nice day together and he is literally crying because he is scared about why he cannot speak.", "How do I make online friends (more specifically on twitter)? I have been active online for 5 years and have not made any real friends. There are some people I talk to occasionally but I think i am just a burden to them. I do not know how to start a conversation myself so I always wait for others to talk to me first.\n\nThere is this girl on twitter who I really want to be friends with but I do not know how. I like her tweets but a lot of her tweets are about her already existing friends. Everyone on there is so close to eachother and i am an outcast. I do the same things as other people I am just so boring that nobody notices. I mostly use video games (like clash of clans) and discord to make online friends. This subreddit has its own discord server too, and there is some really awesome people there. Why not give it a go? \n\nHere is the invite link to our server:  Feel free to join any time, and do not feel pressured to chat right away. A lot of people in the server who are not comfortable enough to chat like to just lurk, or some use emojis/reactions to communicate, rather than typing. And that is okay too. We all understand that a lot of SMers struggle to communicate online. Find really specific things you might have in common with someone.

I have been to several therapists and just recently was told CBT and exposure therapy were the most effective treatments. I feel so discouraged and stuck. I have seen so many therapists and it has not helped. I have been in different social situations, I have tried to change. I feel paralyzed, I become a different person in social situations and can barely talk, unless it is to answer a question. I have tried setting goals to smile at people, greet them etc and even that is often too difficult for me. I also do not see the purpose. I do not care that much if I can greet a stranger at the store as if I can converse normally in social settings such as school and work. I am so sick of being this way and I feel so bad about myself because I cannot even communicate effectively and everyone knows how terrible I am socially and it makes things soooo awkward. I cannot talk to people and I am so lonely and just want to make friends. I am usually very shy and quiet but in one on one settings with people my age I can usually talk a bit more and enjoy time spent with another. But it is not like I have the opportunity to hang out one on one with people who are nice enough to bear with me and want to be my friend. \n\nI feel so stuck. I just got out of therapy again since it was not helping and again I want to pursue it because maybe it would help this time. It never helps. I am so stuck in my ways, I do not know how to act and I cannot talk even when I want to Although CBT and therapy can help with anxiety it does not *necessarily* help with selective mutism. It may just be a part of your neurology and you should not be made to feel bad because you have not \"progressed\". Check out /r/neurodiversity for fellow selective mute-ists (in addition to other neurologies).  The medical world pathologizes too many human divergences despite many of them being hardwired and that hurt no one. Another thing that can help you communicate is ( such as tablets you can write on or type on that can speak the words you type/write **if you want** .\n\nHere is a website that blogs about non-speaking or selective mute-ists : \n\nIf you are a woman, girl or nonbinary person here is another supportive websites for people just like us:  . This may not help much but I recommend you join some sort of online friend finder? I do not remember the name of the website I used but it paired me up with another person based on shared interests. It is been more than one year since we started texting and I can say with certainty it helped me feel less lonely. I would suggest joining some of the more mental health oriented subreddit's Discords. Some of them have voice chats and the people are usually very understanding about people who have a(n extremely) hard time speaking.  \n\n\nThe list I use ( I am a bit the same I think. I am starting to realise that maybe SM affects me more than I realise. \n\nI am just so used to being socially awkward. Like you said, I can be outgoing and be my absolute self with one group and then be WAY more shy, less talkative and like you said, idk how to act. Idk newer people well enough for me to act fully myself. Idk when the cut off is. I am probably afraid that if I just come out and start being like I am with closer people (I could not even if I wanted to anyway) it will just be weird. Hello! \n\nI get what you mean about being unable to speak and everybody knowing about it and thus everything being totally awkward. I try to make fun of my own awkwardness by saying things like \"I wonder how many times Quentin will have to walk in circles around the grocery store this time before he has enough courage to walk in.\" It makes me realize how ridiculous most of my fears really are and has sometimes actually helped me conquer them at least a little bit. Basically I just try to embrace the awkwardness instead of hating myself for it. I know that this all sounds pretty stupid but it makes my life less depressing. I have not the slightest idea if this helped, I hope it does. Thanks for the suggestion! Never thought of that! I am sure it helps to take things less seriously :)", "Uncomfortable on Social Media Does anyone else feel like it would be weird of them to post on social media when the people they have as friends/followers have probably never heard their voice?\n\nI mostly only have my family on Facebook, which includes relatives I do not know and others that I barely know. I always felt odd about posting on there, feeling like no one would care about what I said or posted and that they could end up deleting me because seeing something they did not care about in their newsfeed annoyed them. If I change my profile picture, I always change my settings to \"Only Me\" immediately so no one sees it and thinks I am being vain or that I love myself and want attention. It has been a few years since my last post on Instagram, so I know that if I post, people will get a notification about it. I do not mind when I get those from other people, but I feel as though what is acceptable from other people is unacceptable from me (about many things).\n\nA few years ago, I overheard some strangers having a conversation about a quiet man who never talked much in person, but posted regularly on Facebook. One of the women thought it was strange. This has stuck with me. Before then, I never gave it much thought and had not considered that it could be strange of me to sometimes post on Facebook.\n\nBefore hearing that, I did not post much (mostly photos I took of things other than myself) but often commented on the posts my mum and sisters made. Some people said they enjoyed reading what we said. Now if one of them posts on my timeline, I will only respond with a like. Thinking about it, this probably looks even stranger than if I was actually posting - people could think I am being rude and wonder why I did not reply.\n\nSometimes I miss being able to comment or wish people a happy birthday, but it has been about five or six years, and it feels like if I suddenly start now, it would be weird of me. I am trying to stop caring so much about what people think of me, and I recently came to the realisation that my cousins truly do not even know me. If I have met them, I was most likely not the only quiet one, and they might not even remember that I did not speak. I am sure of it that some relatives would have said horrible things about me behind my back, as I have witnessed them do this to other relatives. This does not help me feel better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else feel like they are \"not allowed\" to post on social media? Me too. I am going to be honest here, they probably will \"judge\" you if you post, but what they say about you just isnt worth anything, especially (times infinity) if they do not fully know you. The reason I do not post is prolly because my sm prevents me from manifesting this and i know i still will not post anything. not that I want to post anything anyway I have not had an Instagram account ever associated with my name, but I did have one associated with my own person (I would post pictures of myself). I was in 6th grade, back in 2014 and in California. At the time I was more obsessed with it and did not really see any downsides to it...although I never followed any girls at my school, that made me feel weird.\n\n*\\*I deleted the account (which I regret losing the pictures) because I think my friend found out my password and logged into it and posted something, so I just deleted the whole account to avoid the drama.*\n\nWhich if I made one now, I still would not go out of my way to follow any girls that I knew since I would be afraid to come off creepy, but if they followed me, I would follow back. The main reason I do not have a current account of my own person (I do have one for a YouTube channel that has no official connection to me, I do talk on).....it is because I do not want my family to see it, pretty much. That is where my biggest issues with this SM lies and with those that know I do not speak. Though when it comes to those at my school, I never spoke in school but they have heard my voice because of my YouTube channel...which I know contradicts my last statement (My family does not know about that channel to this day). I also feel uncomfortable on social media, I have an account that is really me, with art in my photos but no photos of me. I have my work colleagues on it, but feel I cannot post on it without being judged. \n\nI had an account my extended family were on in the past, and they did judge me based on what I posted, even making comments about what I posted.\n\nSo now I do not post anything on there, just rarely checked what others were doing. Probably once every couple of months.  I have created an anonymous Facebook account with a made up name. I use art for photos, and feel more able to post as no one knows me. It feels safer somehow. I had an anonymous account as well, which I only had my online friends on. I had it for ten years, but then Facebook deactivated it because they somehow found out it was a duplicate account. They force you to show identification (mail that was addressed to you, for example) to prove that it is your real name. I do not know if there is a way to get the account back. I can sign in, but it says it has disabled since a certain date and that I cannot use it anymore. \u201cThe best time to grow a tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is now.\u201d By the time social media was a thing I was will into my late teens to early twenties and growing socially. I used social media to find my voice. I would post videos of me speaking, I made friends from different countries (I am still friends with a good bit of them) and I just explored myself as a person. A good bit of people I went to school with told me that is the first time I have heard your voice or I never knew you were like this. \n\nIt felt good to finally be heard but now that I am older and living in a country that does not speak my native language I do not post videos speaking ever. \n\nI am very uncomfortable with anyone I might know over here actually heading what I sound like speaking French. I find that it is much harder to explore this new environment because it is so much larger than the one I grew up with. I can go out everyday and never see a familiar face unless I purposely go searching for one. Maybe it would be different in a smaller community, I do not know.", "Karaoke! I did karaoke with friends for the first time today! I am very insecure about singing in front of people, but I was able to belt out the lyrics for hours and feel like I did not have Selective Mutism at all!

Glad to hear you had such a good time, keep it up! that is amazing. i love to sing as well. i find when i sing in the shower, i am the more authentic and open throughout the day. Well done! I can sing fairly loudly and comfortably by myself but I can never really muster the same gusto in front of people. I tend to just hum or quietly speak-sing the words, perhaps the energy of being on stage and liquid courage would break that barrier I remember being shocked I could sing at karaoke.

COVID ruined a lot of my plans so I had to improvise and I get yelled at my mom for not doing enough (im currently applying to college) .

But I am too scared to be my real self. Extroversion and mutism makes me feel like I am in hell. I do have one friend, I befriended him last year and it was the first time I felt that click, and it is amazing. I am twenty. I am highly extroverted at heart and he lives quite far away. Thinking about all the experiences, stories and people I have missed and how much I still desperately need more people to click with, and from close by, all the while I am falling on those zero connection friendships on the internet fucking once again, which to be honest make me feel really understimulated, like these people do not care for the things I do and embarras me. Again. it is really driving out my usually resilient hope here. \n\nI wonder how fucked up I would be if I did not even have this one friend, like I might actually want to die. The only people I regurlarly talk to beside him is my family and a shrink + other social workers. I already had to cut ties with another online friend earlier this year because I was not happy, it was tiring, worse was they had no idea sonething was wrong, and neither does anybody else I have repeated this curse with is because I never express my real feelings about their opinions , ideas or thoughts espeacially if I strongly disagree with because I am still filtwring myself even if I can speak and I have no idea how and I am way too caught up in the joy of finally being able to talk to someone, while being blinded by the sparcity of social interaction I thrn ignore red flags and would not even know how to counteract them or back off off the friendship. I just get stuck in them over and over again and screw myself over. \n\nSometimes I wish it was appropriate to say, ok I do not like you straight up and it would not have to be such a norm not to \"insult\" others want to be liked. Of course I liked to be liked and of course I would be at least a little insulted about someone saying that to me and that is exactly why it is annoying. Would save a lot of time if socializing could be honest, but I have to come up with some bullshit exit stragedy. I do not even know how I entered this friendship. \n\nHave not felt this lonely since I dropped out of high school. That was the reason I did, I could not take the loneliness over there.

I have been going steady with my girlfriend for a while now. We are long distance and our main form of communication is via text. Just to preface, I feel really happy with her and I love her a lot!\n\nI honestly did not know anything about SM when I started dating her, and I have some questions about it that I do not know where else to ask. I know none of you would be able to answer for her, so I will just ask for your own perspective on things.\n\n1. For anyone in a relationship/deep friendship, how long did it take for you to be fully comfortable speaking to your partner, if ever? \n2. How hard is it to do so? \n3. What helps you the most in situations like that?\n4. Do you have any advice on how to feel closer to her, even with the distance and mutism? \n5. Does anyone else find it difficult to date someone with SM, and what do you do to remedy this feeling?\n\nI want to understand her more. Personally, I am a very talkative person and talking to her even when she cannot makes me happy. Something I find enjoyable is when both of us are on call and she stays unmuted even though she is not talking; it sounds kind of weird but being able to hear her type and do her breathy laugh when I say something funny helps me feel closer to her, which is always my goal.\n\nThere are times where it feels particularly tough to go on. I would not really consider myself to be the most extroverted person on earth, but talking verbally is something I like doing and want to do with her. However, I know what feels difficult for me must hurt her tenfold. She puts in a lot of effort just for me, which has prompted me to do my own research and try to understand her more deeply. \n\nIf anyone can answer, it is greatly appreciated! I am looking for your own experiences or opinions on this matter / relationships with having SM in general. :) My husband and I were long distance before his first visit to my Island.\n\nIt is been a while since those days (we met online in 2009) The first time we actually some together like on video chat or a phone call would probably have been a year into the relationship. We tried early on but my mutism made it very one sided. I was able to do video and voice recordings and send it to him but I have Social Anxiety so it was always a bit difficult for me to do.\n\n\nWhat helps in those situations is that he was very patient and never pushed me to talk or do something I was not comfortable doing. He accepted me for who I am vs trying to \"fix\" me.\n\nTo feel closer you can send handwritten letters. I know it is pretty old fashioned but I really enjoyed seeing his handwriting and knowing that he has to think about what to write instead of saying whatever came to mind. I would send him a journal him of what my everyday was like. He still has them and the letters I sent!\n\nI have never dated someone with mutism but if I did I am in the position to know exactly how it feels and would probably do just as my husband did and just be there for them.\n\nI hope this helps. I am 29, have SM and am also in an LDR. \n\nI had already started recovering before getting to know my boyfriend better (he was an online acquaintance for four years before that, and we started talking more two years ago). By the time we began dating, I had posted voice recordings on the Discord server we are both on. That was what really helped me. \n\nI would record short messages, and I had the option to listen to them before posting them so if I did not like how they sounded, I could delete them. I made it fun for myself by pronouncing words wrong and in a weird voice, or saying them backwards, then normally. Sometimes I will send him recordings of me making animal sounds (he barks if he hears my dog bark, so it is like an inside joke). I am now comfortable voice chatting with him and can talk in proper sentences, although I have a tendency to talk fast, which can make it hard for him to understand my accent.\n\nIf your girlfriend would not be able to do this, I would still suggest that she makes recordings for you on Vocaroo. She does not need to talk, but she could laugh at something funny or make tapping sounds to get used to being heard in some way. \n\nCould she write down how her SM has made her feel over the years so you can understand her better that way? \n\nI have been in other LDRs before now, but was never this comfortable. My boyfriend is very understanding, patient and caring, and never pressures me. If I could offer advice, I would tell to you not to give up. She will talk when she is ready, but if there is pressure, it could make it harder for her. When she does eventually talk, you should try to act normally. Any surprised reaction could be embarrassing for her and remind her of the big step she has made, and that can cause anxiety. At the end of the call, you could say you are very happy and that you are proud of her, but also add that you do not expect her to be able to speak every time, or to say much.\n\nGood luck, and thank you for asking for help. The letter thing is actually really cute, when she wakes up I am going to run it by her for sure :]. I can see why patience would be godsend in situations like that. Thank you for replying, this is some good advice! Thank you for replying. The voice messages idea might work well for her. She is Japanese-American but does not know much of her native language, so she is been learning it online for a while now. I would not expect her to send it to me, but I think trying to vocalize her Japanese would help her a lot, and she could easily pinpoint where her accent cracks. That is a bit off topic, though.\n\nThe voice memos idea is great! I told her about it just now and she wants to give it a try tonight. I did not think about it that way before, but her anxiety does come in perceiving that she is been heard. In our first call where she unmuted way in the beginning of our relationship, I made her laugh at something and she threw her phone across the room because I heard her! I do have permission to tell that story, hehe\n\nThank you for replying. In my time with her, I\u2018be learned the importance of patience. By nature I was never a patient person, and it did cause us some trouble before. If anything, I feel like she is the patient one; I almost do not deserve an angel like her. Hopefully I can adopt more of that trait as time goes on. \n\nSorry for the multiple rants about my girlfriend (I am corny) and thank you for the advice! Not here for advice, just to tell you that you sound (ha) like an amazing boyfriend!! And amazing person in general. Good luck to you guys!!", "Selectively mute in my second language So I am not sure if this is classified a selective mutism, so I figured I would post here to ask you guys.\n\nBasically I am Thai-English, but I did not start learning Thai until I was 17 (English speaking school and household). This was at the same time that I got into a relationship with my boyfriend who could not speak English.\n\nNow, he learned English, and I brushed up on my Thai very quickly. However, I also realized that SPEAKING Thai was very difficult for me. When confronted with a situation when I should speak Thai, I would have the words in my head and on the tip of my tongue, but I could not force myself to speak them. \n\nI could speak to Google so that it could transliterate what I was saying in to text, and I could speak to myself. But the moment somebody asked me a question and expected a response in Thai, I lost the ability to speak. \n\nThis does not affect me at all in English. In fact I am actually a very confident speaker, and do a lot of public speaking. \n\nI am going to start learning in Thai language school soon. I met up with the school last week and they asked me a question in Thai to test my knpwledge. I understood them, but that dreaded feeling came up and I could not respond. I started stuttering for a couple of seconds before resorting back to English.\n\nMy first question is, does this count as selective mutism? And my second question is do any of you have any tips on how I can overcome this in order to learn a language better? I do not want to be frustrating my teachers by not speaking to them in class. I do not have any specific advice, but this is interesting to me as I sometimes find that I can speak my second language (Welsh) but not my first. (English) From what you said, it does sound like SM. SM is very common in people who are bilingual or multilingual. I would try going to a psychologist who can diagnose and treat you.

I can usually talk if someone speaks to me now, because the awkwardness if I do not respond would make me more anxious. But I still think I have SM. \n\nI just feel so isolated now. College is very different from high school. Even though I did not have many friends in high school, people would still talk to me, usually so I could help them with their work. And I did not mind that. I liked feeling useful and it was good to practice talking. But now in college, absolutely no one speaks to me. No one even looks at me. I do not know how to talk to them. The people in my classes just effortlessly talk to people they do not know and it is not awkward. It just seems impossible for me to ever be at that point. There is this person who I really wish I could talk to because they seem interesting and they are really outgoing so they would probably be receptive of me talking to them, but I cannot. Especially now that everyone knows me as the quiet guy. But now the semester is almost over and I probably will not see this person again and I know I will regret not talking to them, but I just cannot do it. It is so agonizing being around people and not being able to talk to them.", "Girlfriend and difficulties. Hi I am having a difficult time with my girlfriend who has sm and I am wondering if it causes people to only be able to say certain words. She claims that she cannot say I love you back . But she can continue talking to me in the same moment. She just is not able to say I love you back. And I just want understand more instead of having communication issues.", "I belong here Im overjoyed to find some place where i belong. I was wondering about this condition for a while and i thought only i suffered from it Welcome to the club lol :) Welcome!", "being mute at school is so hard does anyone have advice seriously dont see the point in going anymore because i cant even talk i dont know what im going to do when i have my french speaking exam, or if i have a presentation, i feel so overwhelmed by it all i just cant stand being there and i dont know what to do, i feel so isolated and i think the 'selective' part of my mutism is getting worse because i used to be able to answer teachers with really short answers but now i cant do that, im worried ill reach a point where i cant even say 'here' for the register, some teachers already skip me because they know i dont talk\n\nand i suck at maths but i cant even ask for help, even though i have a mock exam on friday and im going to fail it \n\ni dont know what to do. i just dont want to go to school, it makes my anxiety so much worse i really wish i could do online school because then atleast i could ask questions by typing Is it possible for you to contact your teachers through email so that they can accommodate you and understand your situation? Well, I managed to graduate with it about as bad or worse, so you might have more time than you think you do. But definitely start emailing teachers and perhaps counselors. I managed to get a 504 which could also help Yeah, it is tough. I hated math in highschool too, but I learned to love/like it in college. What is your math test over?  Unfortunately, you are going to have to accept that this is a struggle for you and choose to struggle against it, rather than accept the consequences of allowing the mutism to defeat you.\n\nI know it does not seem like it now but if you can put things into perspective you will realise that there are far more scary and challenging situations out there than the minor experiences of school life.\n\nYou need to have a good long think and reorient your mind. Change the paradigm. Think differently. Avoid the negative, seek the positive. Even if you have to psyche yourself up every time, get into the habit of doing it.\n\nIt is not going to be easy but life is boring without a little challenge.\n\nI wish I could go back as me now to high school as it would be a different story. You can grow from this and get better. However you need the experiences to get better, so do not give up.\n\nAllow yourself small victories. Never retreat from your successes. If you can say you are \u2018here\u2019 for some classes then you can say you are \u2018here\u2019 for all classes. Build on what you can do. Do not allow yourself to decay.\n\n Never give up, never surrender. Is there a way that you would feel comfortable enough to talk a little if they approach you in some specific way? What would make you feel safe enough to talk? You could ask your teacher on email to answer your questions at a private place on school after class. And maybe with facing the other direction. Also, there are a lot of YouTube videos that could help you understand. It was hard for me too. I was mute basically from pre k to  the end of middle school. It was so bad that I would communicate to others by writing notes and passing it to them.\n\n\nI hated the label \u201cmute\u201d so bad. I was so done with it and I could not stand the way my life was. It was either I do something about it, or stay a mute forever and let life be this way. So I promised myself at the beginning of high school I would make a change, it was very VERY awkward but I literally forced myself to talk. It makes me cringe thinking about those moments but I just really wanted to get away from that life, I could have had a lot of friends or been a completely different person if I was not mute.\n\nI started small by saying Hi or Hey to people. People would always go in front of me and say \u201cHi\u201d to pick on me since they thought I would not respond back. I also started answering teachers questions and oh my it was so awkward since everyone would stare at me and say \u201comg he talked\u201d, but as I kept answering and talking they stopped doing that and got used to it and stopped staring at me. Since they were starting to get used to me talking, presentations were not as awkward as they were before (it was still pretty awkward just not as bad). \n\nEven though I was kind of talking more, my social skills SUCKED, surprisingly though I made a few friends despite that. One thing I would get constantly is \u201cwhy did you never talk?\u201d And I would kind of go back to my old self and not say anything and shrug, I do not really have an answer to it so how would I respond. Other than that, a lot of people were positive and encouraging me to talk more which was kind of cool.\n\nAnyways so even though it was very awkward I do not regret it at all. Today I am in college, I feel like a whole different person. My social skills still kind of suck (as expected from those years of being mute) but it is not as bad as before. I am not seen as a mute anymore. One tip I have is to actively get out if your comfort zone. Even though selective mutism is a bit deeper than just staying in your \u201ccomfort zone\u201d, actively getting out of my comfort zone really helped, look up some tips on that. Also look up some motivation videos on comfort zone (I know very corny but it gave me drive to keep going on this journey). Hope my experience helped you in someway.", "Would my experience be considered selective mutism? I  have been dating my boyfriend  for almost 4 years now. At the beginning when I first met his immediate family members I could barely get a word out. Only when directly spoken to could I force myself to speak a couple words. I chalked it up to general anxiety for a long time. A lot of the initial anxiety symptoms like panic attacks prior to meeting them or shaking/trembling went away over time.  But 4years on I still cant speak my mind freely to any of his family members one on one or as a group. Even when directly spoken to I can only say the necessary words and I shut down for the rest of the conversation. Even though I have things Id like to add to the conversation I cannot for the life of me open my mouth to say them. \n\nI feel really defeated. I have written a letter to his family explaining that I am not trying to be rude by not responding/speaking only in short sentences, I just feel immense pressure and anxiety being my boyfriends first girlfriend. I have tried many times to speak up but it just ends in more heartbreak when it ends with me having a complete breakdown prior to even trying to have a conversation. Possibly, I cannot speak in front of my own family, or those that know I cannot speak normally. I can speak to strangers but I do not have the most practice since I am not often in those situations, it will still feel weird but it is nothing like being unable to speak.\n\nIn my mind I am very expressive and all it would take is to just jump off the bridge (figuratively) to change everything, in private I can speak normally and loud enough to not be an issue.\n\nEdit: That includes extended, although I can say one word to them if told to. Well, this would be taking Selective Mutism literally. Which is true and you do have that. A bit of an unusual case because most people with SM are mute to everyone other than immediate family. For some reason, as I grew out of SM, there is still this one friend that I have whose family I can not speak to. I just cannot open my mouth or get my words out. It is insane and I feel like such an idiot. I force myself anyways and it is gotten better but just not where I feel fluidity in my words.\n\nI have no advice but I understand you. I guess just to keep at it and overtime you will breakthrough and talk effortlessly to them. Just do not give up and keep making it a goal you want to achieve every visit. Take care Thank you so much for your encouragement. I will keep trying I am married, been with my wife for almost 8 years.  I still cannot talk to my wife's family.  When you first meet their family you know they are judging you.  And once I fall into a hole like this, I can never climb back out.  I hoped I would become more comfortable with them over time, but it has not happened.\n\nI only recently learned about SM, but I think I suffer from it and I can relate to what you are saying.", "Me: communicates to the school counsellor that I mouthed \u2019thanks\u2019 to a stranger.

I have the same question, I am 18 and cannot talk to anyone so I do not know how I will succeed I became a web programmer, freelance, only communicated via email. I was very good at it, made good money, but after 15 years of doing it I could not go on. \n\nI strongly suggest you do not make your mutism a lifestyle and instead try to break through it and speak up. That is what I did, in the end. use this time to keep working thru it bro. baby steps. then by the time you work you can do anything u rlly want!

I still am, to a certain degree when triggered. Recently I was also diagnosed with Aspergers, which means the I have difficulties in social situations.\n\nPart of why I feel uncomfortable is my voice. I sound... weak and do not know how to breathe properly.\n\nIn church and youth group when everyone was singing, I never had the courage to do so.\n\nMy mind tells me that learning how to sing is the only way to \"heal this trauma\". I need to quite literally find my voice \n\nBut where do I start? I can watch YouTube videos, but I think I need outside help. But this means really opening up to someone about my past and motivations and that is scary as fuck...\n\nIdon't know... Just wanted to share I can really relate, I would always mouth the words at school concerts, and still struggle to maintain decent volume &amp; breath if I start to feel anxious. You are right that overcoming this anxiety will take gradual exposure &amp; practice. It would be extremely difficult to manage on your own, but potentially possible.\n\nDo not discount opening up to someone though. Whether an actual therapist or just someone close that you trust, it sounds like something you will probably have to do at some point anyways. Believe me, living with most of your personal story completely hidden inside will only make things more difficult, especially to make connections in the future. With that too the best course of action would be gradual exposure. You do not have to spill your whole life story all at once but opening up to trusted people about how you feel and what makes you anxious will make dealing with these things a lot easier, even if they cannot actually offer any direct help or advice.\n\nIf that still feels too intimidating you can look into journaling, getting those anxious thoughts out of your head so you can examine them more rationally would help. You can keep them to analyse them later on, or destroy them if it makes you anxious just having those thoughts out on paper, the point is to get them out in the first place. And remember that all of these processes will be gradual, not instant, and will have some setbacks you will have to work to overcome. \n\nGood luck to you, singing in front of people is still something I find extremely difficult, even impossible. It is only recently I have found my voice at all in dealing with people, and been able to be more conscious with it Appreciate your advice One of my hobbies is playing the uke and singing. I think I find it so therapeutic because it is a way I can express myself with sound that does not involve talking. I am not a great vocalist or anything, the main thing is that I feel more comfortable using my singing voice than when I first started. It took a lot of time, and I still do not sing or play in front of other people. One thing that helps is recording myself and listening back to it. It made me realize that I do not sound bad, and it sort of feels like I am listening to some other person singing and making music. When I was younger I really got into singing but I was too shy to get lessons, so I just started learning how to sing by mimicking the sounds the singers would make! The same thing happened to me at a young age, with sm and anxiety.    I took several years of singing and I am pretty good.  I want to be a rockstar. \nI put aside my anxiety, believe you are strong, you are tough, and you are a star.  Singing on stage is different than talking, to keep practising and you will get into a trance for your dream demands you to do so and gain confidence It is worth trying, but do not go in with the expectation that it will completely cure you or anything. I sing, I cannot practice if I even think there is a possibility of someone hearing me, which has not surprisingly meant I never get to practice enough... But, weirdly enough I am fine in an actual performance even solo in front of many people. Knowing how to sing has not helped me in being able to talk to anyone though, which is why I recommend not to place all your hopes on this as you might be disappointed.", "My selective mutism has made me clingy and selfish I have not had a real friend in years.

I have had to leave multiple previous jobs because the social aspect was too much and I would shut down and not be able to speak. \n\nI have been debating whether I should look into getting out of this profession entirely and switch careers to something else that could be done remotely or that requires much less social interaction. However, before I decide on that, I was wondering if a psychiatric APRN with a selective mutism diagnosis would ever be allowed to use text-to-speech software during appointments with patients in an outpatient or Telehealth setting. I am interested in being a psychiatric APRN but I would not invest the time and money into the education if I was likely not going to be able to deal with the amount of speaking required day-to-day. I am fairly sure the text-to-speech thing would be off-putting and not tolerated by patients. Before I closed off that career path possibility, I just wanted to hear some opinions on that from this subreddit. \n\nThanks! You should not be looking for ways around talking. You should be asking yourself how I can talk more They are right As you probably know SM can be treatable, even if it is difficult. Though that may take time and money. SM may become an issue not just in text-to-speech being potentially of putting to patients, but in the case of medical or psychiatric emergencies where quick and precise communication is required, without the time for getting out the device-typing it out-pressing play-etc. You can still work towards a career in health care just in a slightly alternative role, and perhaps towards treating your SM,  and you seem to be aware of your limitations Thank you, yes that is a great point about emergency situations. For me it is the sustained talking that is an issue. I have a med pass at work in which I have to speak with roughly fifteen patients in relatively quick succession in the span of an hour and about halfway through, I feel that I can barely speak and use mostly gestures to communicate. I see the same group of patients every day and most of them do not seem to care, especially since it is late at night, but there is no way I could ever work in a place like the Emergency Department where the talking is frequent and necessary. I am going to keep looking for slightly alternative roles as you mentioned. I feel that I should not have picked a career in which most roles require so much speaking. I have found a night shift position in which I am not required to speak much, but if I want a higher paying job down the line, I may have to switch careers if I want to accommodate my issues regarding speaking I really do not imagine this issue resolving itself, as I have been trying to resolve it for years and it has persisted. I have had a few breakthroughs using psychedelics on occasion, in regards to my selective mutism and social anxiety in general, but no changes have been sustained. I understand, believe me I do. Talking to someone who has or had selective mutism is a bond you cannot get anywhere else. No one understands us like us and it will always be apart of you and the reason you are who you are. We are apart of the 1 percent\u2019s 1 percent and I had never come across another human being like me in person.\n\nThat being said, you did not lose a limb. You lost your voice and it will always be there in the dark waiting for you to unlock it. You are throwing in the towel on yourself. It took me 20 years to realize that the only difference between me now and the me with selective mutism is mindset. Why let something so trivial ruin your life? Many people found their self worth way earlier than I did. Many selective mutes were cured by middle school while I was stuck with it seemingly forever. You having selective mutism at 25 years old is your fault. It was my fault until I was 20.\n\nMy entire life people told me to, \u201cjust talk.\u201d I thought they were idiots and completely ignorant to what I was going through. Ironic how it took me 20 fucking years to learn that those dumb ass ignorant kids were right. Imagine my shock. You are shooting yourself in the foot and it is a pity. I have never across someone with this issue in person either. \n\nI am glad that you were able to recover, that is fantastic. I have only had these symptoms for the past five years however. I experienced some horrible panic attacks in social settings in my last year of high school resulting from a downward spiral into low self-esteem and persistent anxiety. The social anxiety has not left since and the selective mutism issue, if that is what it is, began roughly five years ago. \n\nAnd yes, I try to practice gratitude every day for what I have. There are so many people who have lived and are currently living lives of horror that I could not imagine.", "stress related mutism? back in late April/early May I was laying in bed with my fianc\u00e9 and randomly and without warning I stopped talking after a medium silence( we were just on our phone and exchanged the occasional meme/words).  I did not think of anything at the time because it was late and I was tired but in the morning I could not speak. like at all. I could not scream or anything, I even locked myself in the bathroom and tried to whisper to my self, nothing.  \nwent to the ER and \"talked\" to a trauma psychologist and head nurse, who both attempted to get me to speak. got a cat scan, nothing (thought i might be having a stroke).  \nno one could figure out what happened. my voice came back randomly while watching cowboy bebop with my fianc\u00e9 28 hours later.   \ni have no idea what happened and cant figure it out otherwise I am autistic as well as having SM. This happens to me any time I have a shut down. When things are too much, my body copes with it by doing everything it can to back me forcibly out of a situation. \"If I cannot speak, things cannot escalate because it does not have any input from me,\" seems to be the logic of my subconscious. \n\nHowever, if things \\*do\\* continue to escalate, I go into meltdown. I get about one moment to give a vocal warning, and then start yelling, throwing myself onto the floor or into objects, hitting myself, whatever I had to do to demonstrate to others that I absolutely could not cope with what was happening.  It is rare now, used to happen once or twice a year, now it is even less. It sounds shameful, and I really hate that I do that sometimes, but the brain can be pushed to extremes when you are not being heard or understood. How much stress have you gone through during that time? My roomates screamed at each other literally everyday and it got bad enough the my fianc\u00e9 started having panic attacks and we hid in various rooms throughout the house, she yelled at us for tiny tiny things. We stopped eating at home. I did not eat for a few days multiple times.\nnot only did the mute incident happen but ive got a tic that happens when i get upset now. didnt use to before I am not sure if what I have is selective mutism but I can certainly relate ! That is exactly how it started for me, my voice just stopped working because of stress or anxiety and I had to wait to say something by accident later to get it back. Sometimes it was quick and sometimes it took a few days, though there is some people I cannot talk to at all Often the underlying causes of mutism are related to factors that induce stress (besides genetic predispositions that affect brain areas involved in speech), especially when anxiety and depression are indicated. I found that most people in this subreddit state about their mutism as a chronic/long-term condition, but this does happen acutely/short-term especially after a stress-inducing experience.\n\nStress activates the fight/flight mode, meaning the brain and body is physiologically coping with the stress. Neurotransmitters released during this fight/flight mode that can cause a change in behavior, whether or not it is noticeable. Mutism, lack of appetite, escaping into different rooms, and tics may served as coping mechanisms or simply behavioral symptoms related to neurotransmitter/chemical imbalances.\n\nAs for how you got out of acute mutism? My best guess is that you found a thought/theme/lesson that introduces a new/\u201cmore-efficient\u201d/\u201cless-abnormal\u201d coping mechanism; something triggered in Cowboy Bebop that made your voice come back. I do watch Netflix or anime when I feel down myself.

What about not talking makes you feel shameful? For me, and I assume you as well, it is the fact that I cant do the one thing humans are meant to do.  \n\nNow, we need to challenge that. Do humans really need to talk to be humans? I dont think so. You are still communicating, you still have complex thoughts and a personality. Your inability to talk doesnt make you any less of a person no matter what anyone else thinks. \n\nThat probably doesnt help very much, but if you get into that line of challenging these negative thoughts it might make things better for you.

My goal is not to make them talk, but to help with communication, being out in the community, and life skills. I work with foster youth and foster kids. My job is to help them with a wide range of goals. Some examples are: being more honest, life skills (getting a driver's license, ID, applying for jobs, etc), learning about emotions, learning how to share, making friends, healthy relationships. It is all case by case. This youth with SM's goals are: communication (not necessarily speaking, but just finding ways to communicate in general), how to pay for things in the community, and life skills. They have never spoken a word to me, and that is totally fine. We have played video games, gone to a store together, and I taught them how to deposit money at a bank. Anyone have any ideas on how I can help them work on their goals? Teach them to work towards overcoming the anxiety. I think there are guides in his sub that can help with that. ***I apologize for the Essay, but I am sure you will appreciate it***\n\nIt is ironic that I am starting to take on this mindset, but I feel like the kid has to want to recover and you just treat them normally otherwise. If they talk, they talk...when they do, do not treat it as abnormal. The reaction does not help, at least not in my case and others I have heard from. Also do not hold the stigma over him in my eyes, that is killer for me. I wish the stigma of my SM did not exist. If everyone forgot I had it in this moment, there would be great progress.  I think 'Jessica Spears' on YouTube gives the best personal take that is on video with their experience and SM, I personally watched through every video she had on it. Maybe they can watch it too?  And read this sub-reddit?\n\nAnd to pre-fix...before I wanted that change as I will say later again, circa 1 month ago....I avoided all SM people and videos. My Mom found another SM kid who lives by me, and I refused to meet up with him.....although one day we did for icecream, and I did not talk to them....and there was a girl who is younger than me, that fell through to meet separately. Although I did not want that either. Though most SM people can communicate with Family, so I am the opposite really, I wish I could talk to Family, and could not talk to strangers (although I will say I did not speak in school much, besides the Nurse who had no clue who I was, so I could talk to her).....Although I did not want serious change in Highschool, if I went back to 9th grade now....since I am in College (my 2nd year which will basically be, what should have been done in 9th grade).....I wish I told my Parents to transfer me to a new school then, but back then I did not hold the mindset I have grown into overtime and most recently over the last month.\n\nI am 18, and I am nervous when talking to strangers, but I can do it and I did it today. My biggest problem lies with my family members, direct family members in specific (extended family would come naturally imo, if I could talk to direct normally). Also I cannot talk to past school members...besides a few friends...and the Nurse lol\n\nTo me, I find it so stupid how I cannot communicate openly with my own family. I want to. I also find it hard to talk about anything that is not brought up to me. I will communicate on sites anonymously such as Reddit, VERY openly. I wish I was more open in person, because in my mind that is my personality...it is very open.\n\n\\*For me when it comes to the Social Worker I had, it never helped because 1st, they brought me to public places where I could already talk.....and the SM stigma was already developed by them (the social worker) onto me, they were apart of my problem...so no progress was ever made, and I will tell my Mom (as little as I tell her, but I speak the most to her) not to bother with the worker further as it does not help me, it just makes me feel worse. The worker never pushed for me to talk louder, and was WAY too reaction heavy when I did speak.\n\nWe were just doing things I could already do, which was ordering food at fast food restaurants, etc.....be it if I was alone and someone I knew from school worked there, or walked in I might have to bail, but otherwise I can do it in the presence of my lonesome. I would say, to also give them time to speak even if they do not. I also wish my Mom would stop telling people I do not speak, the stigma is just spread and that is an issue. I will also tell her not to tell my next college I do not speak, like she did the last one....as the stigma grows. That is part of the reason I am transferring to another college (although my 1st year was online ad for naught) and preferably not the one my Brother goes to. I just want a start alone, although there is a decent chance people from my HS attend there. It is all hard really. That is just something I will have to deal with. Breaking the HS student barrier is not as hard as breaking my Direct Family barrier thought.\n\nI know this is a HUGE rant, but this topic is so heavy and has a lot of thought behind it. Talking about it helps me too, as you probably have seen my own posts on the sub lately, I think I have 3 posts in the last 30ish hours. Also I appreciate you wanting to help, it is something I wish I started seriously working on sooner. I want to be done with SM by 19, that is a little over 3 months...and I started 1 month ago, hopefully I will have a Recovered flair then.\n\n***If you want more detail...since this is a big rant***\n\nAnd for more, my Dad has offered his 2003 Mustang Cobra which is a VERY cool car, and very fast...it can probably do 175mph if it was geared right (now I am getting into car talk lol)....to me if I start talking, no serious motivation was ever there or still there for that front. I am big into cars as you can maybe tell. I was offered $500 by the rich kid in my grade to say one word, I did not say one word...although I did sometimes talk to rando kids...so I think it was more my mentality that , I do not want to take money like that....I would be ask to say \"something\" and then as a wise ass, I would say \"something.\" I also made YouTube videos under an anonymous no-face format where I talked (I can PM you the channel name if you want), so everyone in my grade knew my voice too...which idk, never really affected anything either way. I also only had an Instagram associated to my face in 6th grade, past 7th I did not...only one for my YouTube channel which I was/am expressive on (I have since un-officially quit the channel for non-SM related reasons), although I avoided following any girls in my grade on Instagram for both instances. I always felt weird about that, although there was other drama I got involved in that may play into that, which is shocking IKik....but I did get in my fair share of dramas which affected me aswell......6th grade was my best/worst downfall year socially, before 6th grade no true stigma of me not talking was there.\n\nAlso I did have friend groups in MS, one would have started in 7th....I was very social with them, but I never was that verbally expressive...I was over Xbox.....I left it in 8th. Then in 9th grade I entered into a new friend group (kid had known me through baseball camp where I did not speak), which these people sort of approached me, I was always widely known in my grade for not speaking and such. I never got bullied as I gave no good reaction, and when I was potentially, I just laughed along. I am not one to take too much too serious, which is a problem in its own way. That recent friend group has lasted until the present, although now I have quit playing Xbox (and yes, I did talk to my friends pretty normally...I never started convos that often, and if you were left with me alone, I would be pretty quite and boring).....I only snapchat them pics of my cats nowadays and have hung out with them maybe 5 times in total since 9th grade....I made myself out to be someone who is not reliable to hangout or does not want to. I have not reached out since......if they did, I would be down....but there is sort of other reasons as well why I am not reaching out.....one being I am stuck on this girl I will mention later.....I only snapchat them every few days of my cats (repeated that oops). They are good friends though from what I can tell....SM had helped me decipher who the A-holes are, which is a perk of it. One time the initial friend from that group ordered me a drink from Taco bell since the women could not hear me...she also stole $0.25 in change....that annoyed me, today I could get it but then I could not. And I think with friends or people I get to know too well, I fall into that stigma kind of naturally which is what I hope will not happen in college....although....my friends do not truly know why I do not speak normally...they have asked if my siblings are the same and I tell them no....\n\nAnd why did I start becoming so motivated to change? Well I met a girl with my family at the target parking lot, she liked my car, she had the same one (as far as I know both our first cars)....same grad year as me...Ik weird.....but I realized I wanted those kinds of things in my life, a relationship, going out on my own....and if I do not change....I cannot have that.\n\n**End-Note**\n\nIt also helps to talk about this all or write about it, so as much as I am helping you, you are helping me as well. I literally check this sub all day. I gave up playing Minecraft at least until I start talking more normally, it just took way too much time from me instead of fixing my problems. All I have been doing is working on this the last month. Also God this is my longest Reddit comment ever.\n\nEdit: Also I love reading about the people who have recovered, so you just search 'recovered' in the search bar and then click on r/selectivemutism results. That is what I am going to do after I eat, once again. Well, what are THEIR goals? Do they want to work on communication? It goes two ways and needs to be a trusting partnership. Never make this out to be any easier or any harder than it is. In truth, it is hard. But in truth, it is also not the hardest thing in the world, or even the hardest thing this person has had to experience. They already have within them what they need to move through the world, and they can access those things with more and more ease the more they practice them. That is a big thing that I would mention. Goals like these cannot be met in any kind of linear fashion, and some things that seem easy may be surprisingly difficult while other difficult things may come surprisingly easily. \n\nOne big thing you can do is try to practice moving through the world with confidence without speaking. If you can practice doing that yourself, maybe you can find some tricks that can help the foster kid. If you can model that behavior for this person, that is even better.\n\nDo not try too hard to \"read their mind\" either. Be attentive and sensitive to communication, but allow this person to choose when they want to broadcast something with intention, instead of always relying on watching passive body language. It is a pitfall people who do not know better can fall into. Sometimes it can be hard for people with SM to practice learning how to communicate with people who really want to listen to them, because those people who really want to listen will be attentive to every bit of nonverbal communication. This can feel REALLY ostracizing and uncomfortable (even if it is nice that someone is trying to get to know you)... If it is done well can also ease the anxiety of communication for the person with SM by relying on the proposals and y/n questions that the attentive \"listener\" will use to facilitate communication. This is a great way to get comfortable with someone at first, but it can be overwhelming and quickly lead to overassuming knowledge or emotions on the listeners part and a deepening chasm of misunderstanding as the person with SM cannot correct these assumptions. Yep, I have to add that to something I need to inform my Mom of. When people like my Dad, finish what I am trying to say it makes me just want to give up on trying to speak in the first place. I can talk, you do not need to finish my sentence. It annoys the shit out of me. They think they are being helpful, but you are hurting the Hell out of me...Today I did not even respond to him with yes/no (I have problems talking to direct family), I was annoyed and upset. I will never tell him I am feeling 'not ok' because I just do not want that attention from him. I wanted to talk the most today, I probably ever have in my life and I just did not.\n\nAnd he also does not give me time to respond to anything, he is too cognizant of trying to appeal to my \"emotions,\" to the point where it breaks my emotions. At this point I am not ok mentally, all I want to be is normal. I was ok for a week, but I was just online Reddit staving the pain off, reading about SM and on r/teenagers but the problems I have are still there. What I want in my life is still unattainable, and it just hurts. I already cried at two points in the day, and I have been up 3 hours.", "Silence Is Not Golden - Animated Short Film Based on a True Story - Pei Si Wong, Nigel Ng  This is a very powerful video. I can say I never experienced SM in this way (mine was related to family members) but it is such an accurate representation.

A possibility? I have been passed off as extremely shy/introverted my entire life; talking to my parents as a kid but rarely having full conversations, and hardly speaking in school unless someone chose to interact with me.. And I would still only speak in short sentences/remain silent the rest of the time (which was the majority of the time). \n\nNo one in my entirety of living (almost 23 years) has ever truly known me on a deeper level. I struggle divulging more than surface level stuff out loud even with people I have known a long time and feel otherwise comfortable with; only can I open up more emotionally through writing or text to express how I am truly feeling.   \n\nI have noticed this causing problems in my romantic relationships. Without the alternative of texting my emotions, if serious topics come up or anything arises within our relationship that bothers me, no matter how much I want to communicate I physically feel that I cannot. I describe it as feeling a physical barrier between my vocal cords and my mouth.   \n\nI have started sobbing during these situations, on multiple occasions \u2014 just due to the pure frustration of not being able to speak. Every time after the fact, the person will tell me I should have just said I am not ready to talk about said thing yet... But it is not that I do not feel ready to talk; I want to talk... And I try so incredibly hard, but I just cannot get the words to escape. l wish there were words that accurately described how painful it feels. \n\nThis has led to a lot of self-hatred; feeling unworthy of having romantic or even platonic relationships because my silence in such vital times eventually ends in me absolutely destroying and losing these connections.

I am terrified to even continue relationships with anyone new.", "Is this SM? I am 19 years old and I have a lot of trouble talking to my mom, and if i can talk to her at all I can only do so in baby speech, which is making me feel extremely stupid and uncomfortable. I can talk to strangers normally though, even if it makes me very anxious. And i can talk to my boyfriend comfortably and without any problems. But I cannot talk to anyone at all if my mom is in the room. I also lose the ability to speak when i get upset. Then I cannot even speak to my boyfriend, I can only make a \"hmmm\" noise I think this probably has more to do with your relationship with your mom specifically. SM is usually characterized in somewhat the opposite way: the ability to speak freely when around close friends and family, but not in public. People with SM usually have a very hard time communicating with strangers. You may very well have some kind of social anxiety disorder, but I would be surprised if it were SM. It sounds like it might be. There was at least one case of SM similar to this mentioned in the book *Selective Mutism In Our Own Words*, where the SM started with a trigger person and \"spread\" to others. Whether or not it is SM, it sounds like you are struggling with anxiety and it might help to see a therapist or talk to someone else about this issue. Actually this is still possible. I remember reading one case where someone could not speak at home to his mother and his stepdad as well (he was abused at home), but could speak freely outside to others. He was extremely embarrassed and would not tell any of his friends, as he was ashamed by what they would think if he told them. Finally he sought therapy and tried his best to speak to his mother (it is in the book 'selective mutism in our own words').\n\nAlso this is not OP's case, but untreated selective mutism can lead to progressive mutism, where eventually a person will stop talking at home too. I fear this is happening to me, because I am now struggling to speak to my dad at times. I agree I am definitely not saying it is not possible, just that my first instinct would be to classify this as some other kind of social anxiety disorder because it contradicts some of the characteristics of \u201ctypical\u201d SM. But you are right, in a lot of ways it is similar. I personally have not experienced symptoms of progressive mutism so I do not know much about this. To me, OP\u2019s account sounded different from my experience with SM, but I think we would need to know a lot more to be able to really evaluate whether this is SM or not. However, it is similar enough that resources for SM might be helpful to OP either way! True! Tbh, if I had not read that story, I definitely would not have thought it was possible, as I have not heard of SM other than \"speaking at home or where you are comfortable, not to strangers or others\". But yes you are right! Only a true professional can diagnose what this is. We can just offer advice from our own experiences. Yea I am kind of like this with my dad, but I feel\nMore comfortable with other ppl like friends I am the opposite when I am upset I can almost say what I want because I am not thinking about it or as nervous about what I am saying one way more confident then", "I am getting a part-time job I am in high school and looking to get a part time job soon. My SM has gotten better throughout the years but I am still worried I am going to shut down if I get the job. Trying to get a job in stocking or cleaning so I do not have to talk much. Wish me luck. This is a big step in my life I am proud of you.\n\nI am 16 and I cannot, I have tried but it did not work out, I feel bad because my family is really poor and I want to help. Thanks. I am sorry it did not work out for you. Maybe sometime in the future it will. My sister manages at a bar, she is offering me a chef job when I am 18, maybe that will work. I hope it does work for you. Good luck I was in your shoes a few years ago. I got hired as a bagger and worked there for several years. I was a star employee for a while, but one thing led to another and the people I cared about most ended up betraying me, which has made me even less social. But I also happen to live in an area that is changed in demographics really radically in the last few years, ultimately what screwed me the most is that a crapton of Hispanics moved to my area but I did not learn Spanish, which crippled my job growth. I hope you do not go through anything like that. I wish you the best. I am working at a warehouse now because I do not like talking to anyone. They all talk mad shit about me but maybe they will not fire me. It is not like I am in a customer service environment. The only people I will have to talk to as a chef would be my boss (my sister) and the waitress (My sisters girlfriend) so nobody that I will be anxious around. Yeah, that would probably work. Unfortunately for me, I do not have a kitchen background on my resume so getting any restaurant job would be a crap-shoot for me (and I have tried it before, it is kind of tough).

I was lucky enough to attend a school with amazing teachers who treated me like any other kid, but also respected my limits on talking. I had friends that I played with and all of my classmates knew me and did not ever even question my \"differences\", they just accepted me the way I was. Although I have fond memories now, I can also remember times when I was so anxious I felt like passing out or I could not stop shivering.

I went through lots of ups and downs in elementary school but I was always treated the same as anyone else and I honestly loved going to school most days.     \n\nMy parents were of course trying to find a solution for me and they took me to countless different therapists. I resisted all forms of therapy (I would sit in their room and not respond to them at all lol). Eventually, they gave up and just let me be.

I liked to ignore it and pretend nothing was different about me.      \n\nFast forward to me going into my sophomore year of college.

She asked me about my SM and I told her that I could not control it and I do not know why I was \"chosen\" to have it. She told me she could tell that I was learning and understanding her by the look in my eyes. I am so happy that I was able to come back to her classroom and have a conversation with her after so many years. I feel a lot of relief and it is like a weight that I did not know I even carried has been lifted off of me. I thanked her for everything she is done for me because she really set the precedent for how I was treated by my other teachers. I have gotten over another hurdle.

So I am wondering if anyone\u2019s voice is also unusual as a result of not speaking for long periods of time. Thoughts? I have never really thought it was weird, per se, but I also have a relatively monotone, low voice for a girl. I jokingly describe it as sounding dead inside and a friend of mine who likes doing voice impressions has told me he just cannot do mine because it is not as high-pitched or soft as other girls we know. I do not really pause like you do during sentences, but I do do what I like to call \u201cverbally buffering\u201d where I just say \u201cuh\u201d and \u201cum\u201d and \u201clike\u201d a lot because I talk fairly fast and my mouth tends to finish talking before my brain can form the rest of my sentence, so I have to pause to think through what I was going to say and sometimes I say something that does not work in the sentence the way I want it to and I have to backtrack and replace it with a better word. So for me, it would be a bit like \u201cso today I, uh, went to the store and I got, like, food and stuff\u2014 I got groceries.\u201d I have a similar experience, especially when I am in a setting that is not rushed. In a setting that is rushed, I tend to stammer, and kind of stumble over my words a bit if its real bad. I think its a consequence of things like mutism, or just generally not speaking much, but I am no authority on the matter. It might be helpful to get speech therapy? I got some when I was very, very young. I was not talking at all, but I knew English. I just needed a bit of help. It may be different for adults, but I still think looking into that might prove worthwhile, mutism or no. I started doing about three voice calls a day as exposure therapy because I was not used to my voice sounding deeper than my internal monologue. After about two weeks, my vocal cords got used to all the activity and got easier to manipulate. I had a similar voice and today I wonder if maybe it reflected my emotional state.  They are coming out with AI\u2019s that can analyze your voice to diagnose depression amongst other things.

I said one word to a guy and he bothered me for months, everyone wanted me to say things like \"googoo gaga\"\nThis made it much much harder for me to speak but thankfully because I stopped speaking no one talks about it anymore. My throat also hurts when I speak after not speaking for a while, which gives me more reasons to hate my voice and just not talk at all :,) glad I am not alone.", "Is this SM? I have known anxiety issues. I get really anxious at the thought of saying many words or phrases, and I simply freeze when I need to say them because I get really uncomfortable. This has gotten worse as I have gotten older, and now I get anxious at the thought of saying many various names for things. I really need to try really hard to say things that make me anxious; I can sometimes push through it, but it is very difficult for me. I also have some trouble speaking to certain people, particularly if they are not very close to me. These things have become a huge problem for me to the point where I have a lot of issues making connections with people because I risk having a panic attack over something as simple as saying a word or phrase related to my interests. I really wish there was an easier way for me to overcome this anxiety. Definitely sounds like it to me (mom with a SM kiddo who is done a ton of research).  I am the same in pretty much every way, you are not alone... Hey OP, below in brackets is a post I left on another thread earlier today. I hope it helps you! If you have any specific questions just ask. :)\n\n[[I have been in your position. I eventually overcame Selective Mutism and, looking back, I think I can offer some advice. What you have definitely sounds like selective mutism but what you label it is not super important. I had selective mutism for as long as I can remember. I only spoke to immediate family and no one else. I was very afraid of embarrassment, and if I was put in a situation where I was expected to speak I simply would not. Another aspect of it for me was if I started talking I did not want people to make a big deal out of it or tell me they were proud of me (I did not want to be the center of attention), so I just did not speak.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is Selective Mutism is not something you are stuck with forever. You can and absolutely will overcome it. When I was 13 I made the decision that I was not going to except the life of a selective mute. I decided to do whatever was necessary to crush SM. You are going to have to stare your fears right in the face and say \u201cI am bigger than you!\u201d\n\nIn my experience the only way I beat SM is through internal motivation. My parents, or anyone else, telling me to start talking failed to resonate with me (mostly because I am incredibly stubborn). But when I decided I was going to start talking it was my own choice.\n\nHere is what I would recommend to start with:\n\n1.\t\u2060Acknowledge to yourself that you want to speak freely, without fear, and you want it more than anything. You should become obsessed with wanting to talk to people. The quality of your life will be better if you open up to people and communicate. I cannot express how much you should crave this.\n2.\t\u2060Identify a step of action you can take this week. Whether it is talking to one of your teachers or for me it was muttering \u201cthank you\u201d to a worker at Shenanigans. After taking this step, all your future interactions will be a little easier.\n3.\t\u2060Continue taking little steps to gradually open up to people.\n\nImproving your social skills is a life long journey that never ends. Once you are more comfortable talking to people you will begin to make some good friends and in my case I actually enjoy chatting with people now. I do not regret that I had Selective Mutism because it made me very independent and emotionally self sufficient.\n\nRemember, you have a whole life ahead of you; you do not want to go through it as a mute. When you break through SM and start talking to people I promise you your life will be better and, you will be unstoppable at any task you set your mind to.\n\nI could go on about this forever but I will stop here. I would be happy to answer any specific questions you have.]]", "Who else is here and wants to get this sub active? This sub seems pretty dead but I would love to see it more active. Anyone else around? Shall we introduce ourselves and see what we have in common? :) How surprising! The mutism board is quiet. xD\n\nYes, I do think it is a shame. I would like to see it more alive- but maybe the fewer people who come here means there are more people happy and healthy. I dunno.\n\nAnyway.  Hello, I am me. I have not had the best mental health.

I know that is strange to admit. It does not sound true- writing it out like this. But there it is.  If I could possibly get away with never talking again, that is just what I would do.

I was very shy as kid first the first 2 years of school I would not say a single word during the day. I went to a tiny private school so I did get comfortable with the same ten people for ten years or so and was eventually able to have a conversation with the people I saw every day. Aka my classmates. I was never able to talk to teachers who were brought in for short periods of time. Aka librarian, Art teacher, language teacher, etc. I did regress now and then but once I made the switch to an Ginormous public school that was it. Did not say a word at school at all until I graduated high school. \n\nI have trouble in certain situations now, places like a classroom setting or the office at my job are really hard for me. I have to remind myself that I can speak because I default to nodding or gesturing. If I do manage to speak it is barely above a whisper. \n\nOut and about is generally okay for me. As a rule I do not like crowds but I can do small talk with a cashier though I prefer the silence. Drive thrus are a weird one that is hard for me. I feel like I am yelling only to be told they can barely hear me. One on one conversation outside of work and school are generally okay. It is going somewhere where I am expected to speak that is hard. Or situations in which people are generally social, then I cannot even do one on one convos I am just completely shut down. I do not have any friends.\n\nIt is so hard to explain but for example I generally do okay with interviews but once I have the job I do not talk to anyone. I worked for 2 years at my last job and when I was leaving to start grad school a coworker described me as meek I do not think I said more then a few sentences to them each. I asked my family if they describe me the same way and they said heck no! I have thoughts/opinions/feeling and input that I would like to be able to share but when it actually matter my entire brain shuts down and nothing. I just as it was in public school I can easily go 8-10hrs at work or school and not utter a single word to anyone. It is not because I do not want to it is because I cannot. \n\nI have been to a counselor since starting grad school as I have experienced a lot of anxiety. I tell them \u201cI am bad at speaking I need help so that I can make connections/meet people have input at work or in the classroom\u201d she always responds you are not that bad see how you are talking to me. It makes me want to pull my hair out, this is obviously not the type of situation I am talking about. I know how you feel. Life can really be hard. I was once described by my friend as a hushed friend. I realized while growing up that no one except yourself can help you. It is always an inner struggle for me. Yeah I get that, it is just I have been this way for 20+ years, as long as I can remember, and no matter how much I try to \u2018will\u2019 myself to speak it just does not work. I myself do not know when and how my SM started. I am in my mid 30s now, but in my 20s I still have a bit SM and it is been lonely at work. It does help to have one close friend that would make you secured. I was diagnosed at 19, best option is find someone specialised in sm because they are the best help sometimes.

If I am trying to say it and I cannot then I have to reassure myself that the next thing I am about to say is not the other thing that I could not say before. Wow that sounds really confusing sorry. I am alright in school presentations surprisingly bc I am more scared of the embarrassment than the talking especially if I have a script but for other things like talking to my parents, friends, teachers, therapist I just cannot say things sometimes and it is interfering with my academics.

I believe I have Avoidant Personality Disorder. \n\nBased on this data, would you say I Have SM? I am bringing this up with a new psychiatrist as soon as I can. (not looking for diagnosis, just support from anybody who may be able to relate) Sounds like SM, especially when you know you have something to say, and can even articulate it in your mind somewhat, but it feels like the connection between mouth and mind have been severed. I can definitely relate Same. It is so frustrating. Sometimes it feels like I do not respect myself. Because I do not say anything... but I truly do. I just cannot say anything... :/ I had SM as a kid but outgrew it. Except I completely relate to what you are talking about. Cannot speak at all when hurt. Did not realize it was still affecting me so much The same thing happens to me. I get treated badly and all I can do is just sit there and take it in. cant defend myself or anything. makes me feel trapped. When I was a kid I have more serious case of SM, in short I would not talk to adults. Now when I am in my 20s, I do not really experience SM except when I feel really strongly. When I had a break-up with my ex I was so overwhelmed I was not able to speak to him at all, it felt pretty embarassing, like I was that kid again, I just wrote what I wanted to say on my phone but it still was not really what I felt. I tend to shut off as well when I talk to psychologist or a therapist or basically anywhere I need to talk about feelings.", "As someone who used to have SM, the analogy I always think of is standing next to a cliff. When you are standing next to a cliff, you are very much capable of jumping off of it. You physically can and the physical motion of jumping off is the same thing as jumping a couple feet forward on level ground. You *can* jump. \n\nBut the thing is, you cannot. It is literally impossible for you to willingly jump off a cliff unless you actually want to die in that very moment. You could stand there for days trying to jump off but you would never actually do it. It is useless to argue that you *technically* can jump off when you very much cannot mentally force yourself to do it. \n\nThis is why I think it is really terrible for people to tell selective mutes \u201cokay, but just speak. You technically can, so why do not you?\u201d There is as large of a chance that a selective mute in that moment will speak up as there is of a total mute. Mental and physical barriers sorta blend together when it comes to whether you can or cannot do something at any given moment sometimes and there is nothing gained from forcing someone who *cannot* speak to feel worse about themselves because you keep harassing them for it. That is a great analogy! I wish people would stop thinking I am just shy.\n\nI mean it might seem weird to people that I am only mute in *certain situations*, because they only know about people who are fully mute. I remember using a really similar analogy actually! I described it as standing at the top of the high dive. You go to jump off, but your body freezes and you cannot do it. Still, nobody understood. It was really frustrating. That is a great analogy. My daughter has told me that it is kind of like standing directly in front of a brick wall. She cannot move forward, because the wall is in her way.\n\nShe does say, however, that wearing a mask makes her feel safer. She says her mask is kind of like a superhero costume - when she puts it on, she can do things that she could not do before.

Wow.", "Could this be selective mutism It started around when I was in preschool (3~4), before I was perfectly fine with talking to people, I still have some pieces of memory where I was talking to people normally, but then I just stopped, do not remember how or why it happened, I would not talk at all not even my friends or even to ask to go to the bathroom.\nThroughout elementary school I gradually began speaking, but only in necessary situations and very very quietly. I also began speaking comfortably with some people, but very few. Then in.middle school I did not have any friends at all. \nWhen I started high school I wanted to change things so I began trying to push myself, I think it worked, I can talk to plenty of people,(still kind of nervous about it most of the time)\nI only recently found out about selective mutism and thought the symptoms were similar to mine, but the stories I have heard from people seem a lot more extreme then mine so I am not sure. From a lay point of view, it fits. I always have to question my diagnosis because where I live, I cannot officially get diagnosed correctly mainly because of my age and gender.\n\nIt sounds like what I did, only speaking when .... Oh ok, thanks for replying :)\nDo you think getting properly diagnosed would help? Getting a proper diagnosis will help you get the help you need, but in my case, it did not matter because no one would help me. I had to do everything on my own. I was similar to you was as a child in the mid 1980s. In today\u2019s diagnostic criteria I would have likely received a diagnosis but it would have been mild.  (I would speak when spoken to).  My elsest daughter likely could have received the diagnosis when younger.  But is more verbal now.  My youngest daughter has SM.  Her SM is fairly severe but her generalized anxiety is low. it depends on if you still have situations where you cannot speak in certain settings. selective mutism can be recovered from so it is more about your current self I think? sorry if weird to reply late I never see posts from this sub on time \u2764\ufe0f tbh though part of your situation does sound similar to how I am in school, and talking quietly is actually a symptom too, not necessarily just flat out not talking. I used to whisper at times but it was barely audible. usually sm gets a lot worse without treatment but maybe what you did w gradually pushing yourself helped you to overcome it possibly? or at least do better with it. unless u still have those not talking issues.. either way whether it is social anxiety alone or lasting sm I definitely think it is something to think abt possibly get treatment for if you feel that it would be beneficial to you", "Are any of you on Zoloft?

No side effects - just a little upset stomach at first and I did not even remember this until someone reminded me of how I felt. Was not dependent &amp; stopped after 2 yrs. Was great.", "Question for people who used to have selective mutism I just learned about selective mutism, and I definitely had it as a teenager. It does flair up sometimes, but for the most part I talk when I want to talk now, which is very nice. The way I started talking was by observing how I was okay with talking to my parents, and trying to figure out how to apply that to other situations. The things I observed were that 1. I did not care what they thought because I did not feel I would be rejected, or if I was I would survive and nothing bad would happen, and 2. I never internally filtered what I was saying.\n\nThe first few times were pretty awful, but I knew that when you only say 1 thing and you screw it up, you have screwed up 100% of your speech, wheras if you say 100 things and screw up 1 thing, you have only screwed up 1% of your speech. So I knew it would get easier because the stakes would get lower and lower. \n\nBasically the result was that I removed the filter, and I said things as soon as they entered my head. The result was that I overshared a ton, I said a lot of boneheaded things, but I gained a lot of confidence and a comfort level that really helped me. Now I am having problems in my relationship with my husband where as soon as I think before I speak, I end up mute again. So the result is I either become not at all communicative, or I can be extremely tactless, abrasive, hurtful, and dominating of the conversation. My therapist suggested I add in a pause before saying things, which is very hard for me because it triggers the mutism. I have been trying though. There have been moments where words are flowing despite the pauses, but as soon as the conversation becomes stressful, I clam up or I go full motormouth and dominate the conversation.\n\nHave any of you dealt with this? Do you have any insight about how I can tackle this? My first thought is that what are you talking about with your husband that is triggering all of this tactless, abrasive, and hurtful stuff? I am like you where sometimes I can put my foot in my mouth. With my husband I always apologize immediately if something came out in a way that was hurtful, but it is never something that did not need to be said. Another good thing to remember is that when the conversation is getting heated it is better for the relationship to put a pause on it, hug it out, take a break, and talk it through later with less heat. It is basically any normal couple conversation that has a negative connotation. Like say, \"I feel stressed and unappreciated when you do not do the dishes when I leave for the weekend.\" I only want to communicate my needs and I do not mean to attack or blame him at all. But it comes out as insanely cutting and critical because I do not relent. \n\nLike it usually goes like this.\n\nMe: \"Hey I am kind of upset that you did not do the dishes.\" \n\nHim: \"Do not worry, I am getting to them- \" \n\nMe interrupting: \"oh well I am kind of worried, because you had like three days to do it already, and I trusted you to get them done, so I feel like I cannot rely on you\"\n\nHim: \"I am sorry, I have just had a really hard few days -\"\n\nMe interrupting again: \"okay well why did not you do it? Or else tell me you were not going to so I did not think you were going to? I feel like you did not tell me because you knew I would insist on you doing it. Why do not you want to tell me about things like that? Do you really think I would not understand? I feel like you do not trust me! It makes me feel lied to and it could really be avoided if you just talked to me about it. But I do not understand why you did not talk about it!\"\n\nHim, interrupting because I do not stop talking \"Well I just hurt my back and so -\"\n\nMe interrupting back \"well if you told me that at the beginning, we would not have this problem! Why did not you answer my questions?\"\n\nNot realizing that I literally just fired 1000 questions at him that he had zero chance to answer.\n\nLike I do not think there is anything wrong with the content of what I am saying, but it is all in the pacing. If I was able to just stop after one sentence, wait through the silence, listen to what he has to say, stop for a second before responding, and let him talk, I think there would be zero problem. But since it is so rapidfire I think it comes off as really attacking and critical even though I do not mean it to be. But the problem is, as soon as I try to pause, I get stuck, and I can only say things stupidly, like with random volumes for each word, or way too quietly to hear. It is like I am incapable of talking any slower than my thoughts. It is really an annoying problem because either my husband feels overwhelmed by the barrage or totally frustrated at being a captive audience as I try to spit out a sentence haha. Honestly he is a saint. Oh my god this is SO Familiar to me - word for word I have these same convos with my husband too. Honestly at this point I just let this stuff go and not even bother talking about it. Nothing good ever comes of it. With us it is folding the laundry. I ask him if he feels like folding the laundry RIGHT NOW or not, otherwise I will do it. He says yes, I will do it. I bring the clean laundry TO him. The clean laundry sits on the couch and gets more and more wrinkled and covered in cat hair and then a few days later it falls on the floor and turns into dirty laundry again.  There is nothing to discuss. Either the work gets done by one of us or it does not get done at all and at this point I do not care which of us is it. Because honestly? Our sharp words would be justified, but they would not help. Eventually I have at least convinced him 10 years later that if neither one of us is up to doing the work then it is *acceptable* to hire a cleaning person if our budget allows!\n\nI have always found guidance in The Buddha's 4 precepts for right speech:\n\n1. Abstain from false speech; do not tell lies or deceive.\n2. Do not slander others or speak in a way that causes disharmony or enmity.\n3. Abstain from rude, impolite, or abusive language.\n4. Do not indulge in idle talk or gossip.\n\nTalking about when the work is going to be done and why it is not done yet is to me idle talk and gossip, and causes disharmony. Not worth it. What really interests me, is I expected you to say your husband interrupts you based off of you feeling unable to speak originally.\n\nVery interesting.\n\nI agree with u/cape-starling\u2019s Suggestions below. I actually have a relationship contract with my spouse for standards of behavior including things like: listening without talking over the other, no name calling, no cussing each other out during arguments, respecting if anyone calls a timeout. That sounds hard :/ my husband has ADHD, and I do as well, so I completely understand the inability to do a simple job even when it is extremely important to you and people you love. It is such a hard situation. And I adopted a similar strategy where I ask him to do it in the present! That really helps with the\"time blindness\" with ADHD. I know if he is \"going to do it,\" it is extremely difficult for his brain to transfer the task from \"going to\" to \"doing it now.\" It works really well, until we both start struggling haha then we help each other. He sets a timer, I do it while he cheerleads, he takes over when I hit a wall, I cheerlead... We are a couple of helpless dummies haha. Meds help a lot! He is much more able to manage future tasks, or multi-step tasks when he is not randomly inspired lol. He can actually focus on what he wants to. It is a beautiful feeling.\n\nOne thing I have learned is that talk is idle when you do not have a way to understand the situation. Just have to bridge the gap with love. Like he intuitively understood why I could not make myself do a 5 minute job, because he had the same problem and forgave himself. I DID NOT forgive myself, and I thought I was lazy lol. Then I got diagnosed and started meds, and suddenly started helping with everything I wanted to, and I just felt so happy that he did not criticize me even though we did not understand, he just loved me through it. Who knows what is going on with your husband! It could be ADHD or any number of problems out of his control that are not even a \"thing\" that we will all understand in 20 years. And like this talking too fast thing with me! There is a lot to be said for patience and trust and unconditional love to bridge the gap until you can gain the knowledge you need to talk productively. Yeah I have that contract too, just as a personal standard for myself. I just suck at the listening without talking over the other part rofl. I do not know how to not become mute when I do not talk at the speed of thought. I think we have excellent, productive conversations when I can slow down, like I think the stuff we talk about is super important for us to be a team, but I just cannot without going mute. He does amazing though. Oh, I definitely deal with this. I cannot let myself think before I speak, otherwise I start overthinking it and start revising and re-revising what I want to say in my head until it is too late to say it and the topic has already changed.\n\nSo, my solution? I think as I speak. I start talking, sort of enter \u201cautopilot\u201d where I just grab words out of thin air and stick them together and hope they are the right things to say, and if I need extra time to rethink something I want to say or figure out what I will say next, I just add an \u201cuhh\u201d or a \u201clike\u201d or I dumb it down to a point where it does not technically make sense but it still gets my point across.\n\nI can give an example of this\u2014 just this morning, I was in class and I was called on to read something aloud, then was questioned about my word choice. I said something along the lines of \u201cI said \u2018consumers\u2019 because when I think of drama as a genre, I do not just think of plays, I think of books and movies and...\u201d That was the point where I ran out of media types to list on the spot and I ended up saying \u201c...other things I... do not... do.\u201d Made no sense but it got my point across, at least. Best way to do this is to say it in a way that is dumb but funny so at least you can laugh it off afterward. My example does not quite qualify as funny, but it is certainly dumb, haha. That is exactly what I do! It just sucks because then I cannot pause to think without getting completely stuck, and it causes me to hammer people with questions without thinking, which comes across as overwhelming and attacking.

You are probably much more capeable of it than you realize. You miss every shot you dont take, go put yourself out there. Even if your not comfortable adding to a conversation, you can just kind of lurk. You might feel like adding something some time and boom, you are doing it. You are already doing it, even if a forum post is less direct than a chat. It really is hard to take that step when you have social anxiety and SM. Take your time.

Swag's advice is great as well. I am not quite sure what your Discord handle is, but I am Quill on the SM chat and my DMs are always open!

It helped me see a huge amount of other people are also deeply self conscious about their social standing, their social skills, etc. Not sure if it will help, but the discord has a slow chat. Less pressure to reply in a certain span of time. You could also use the gratitude-goals or empathy-vent chats for putting out indirect chat topics. Using those has gotten me to talk more than I ever would otherwise.\n\nI know it is hard, and I know saying that might mean very little. But if you would like to join us on the discord, you are welcomed to. Whether it is one word or one paragraph, there are people there who will gladly accept you. Could be performance anxiety. Just keep practicing conversing with people. The more you do it, the less anxiety you will feel and you will be able to relax more. What would you like to be able to talk about. I often find just commenting on the weather or something is enough to start.  Maybe ask a question so it is not about you. I find strangers easier as will never see them again or have and need or requirements.", "is selective mutism a speech impediment ? ", "When the throat gets caught when trying to speak, is it neurological or are the neck muscles physically tightening?  It is actually physical/physiological. They have done studies recently and found that people with SM have elevated laryngeal tension when trying to speak, much higher than the normal level. Which is directly linked to the anxiety aspect of SM. \n\nLink to the study: \n\nInteresting stuff. I always felt it was physical for me so it makes sense. That is really interesting. Just sitting in bed I and noticing I am flexing mine This is really helpful. I am a middle-aged person who had what I now believe to be selective mutism when I was a child/adolescent. I thought I had mostly overcome it after years of forcing myself to speak in uncomfortable situations. Unfortunately, living through a global pandemic has apparently increased my anxiety to the point where my vocal cords now constrict and it is very difficult for me to speak in many work situations. It is beyond embarrassing to barely be able to speak when conducting job interviews, giving presentations, etc. I am now investigating seeking professional treatment for this problem for the first time in my life. Thank you that is exactly the answer I needed! I am glad to hear you are seeking professional treatment, I hope all goes well for you. The pandemic also made my SM progress regress. I wonder what can be done to combat this. Singing lessons of all things perhaps? Well, SM is a considered a type of social anxiety disorder so treatment is exposure therapy and anxiety management based. Taking things too far too fast in exposure therapy can cause setbacks and more anxiety, so you would want to start with smaller things and build up as you build more comfort and decrease anxiety. Though if you feel you would be able to do singing lessons go for it. It is fairly individual. Of course! I am currently taking things slow with exposure therapy, trying to undo years of severe social anxiety including selective mutism. I would like to join a choir or something down the line to help with expressing myself and opening up my voice!", "What does Selective Mutism feel like? Does it feel like choking when you try to speak and cannot get your words out?\n\nI am an adult in my late 30\u2019s, experienced severe anxiety and depression, caused by stress at work with pressures of workload and bullying from work colleagues. I found it increasingly difficult to talk at work, I would sit at my desk all day and not talk to anyone, and then in meetings I found I choked when I needed to speak, I had to cough, and still really struggling to get any sound out, and feeling really stressed and pressured with those work colleagues in the meeting. (Horrible situation which I am now no longer in).\n\nIs this what selective mutism feels like? yes, I experienced choking sensations when I tried to speak at work. I do not have the choking sensation, for me it is like opening my mouth and just nothing. Nothing comes out even though I wanted it too. My mind is usually very busy but it gets wiped clean so I close my mouth and become a statue basically. For me it is like a freeze response. It is fear that if I move or make noise I will die. And even if I try to talk I feel incredibly disturbed as if it is a form of self harm This is like a perfect explanation i relate to this so much I get a choking sensation as well as a dry throat that is actually kind of painful. for me i just freeze in the spot and cannot speak at all no matter how hard i want to, like a deer in headlights almost the most frustrating thing is when someone thinks you are just being rude and ignoring them. i get this very often and i hate to seem like that same, it is so frustrating In my case it is more like my ability to think clearly gets hindered and as a result of that, words just do not come to mind for me and I feel like I have no idea what to say. I would need to put in a ton of effort to think of something to say and it just does not come to me.  Emotionally, it feels like if I have to speak when I do not want to, and if I am going to be forced to.. I will literally die or be killed. Those emotions literally feel like impending doom for me. The feeling becomes so uncomfortable and unbearable, the flight mode turns on in me... a panic attack will usually come there was never a cause for my selective mutism, but it seems like bullying causes it for a lot of people. \n\nit sounds like you freeze and cannot speak, which plays into the anxiety part of selective mutism. it is a common fear response.\n\nwhat you describe could either be selective mutism, or just a specific coincidence in which you feel too scared to talk.\n\nselective mutism is persistent, and happens on multiple occasions. so if you noticed that it kept happening over and over again, chances are you are experiencing what it feels like.", "SM and Shy Bladder? Has anyone else also experienced a \"shy bladder\" in public places? Yes! In school, sometimes I would end up missing the entire period because I was in the bathroom waiting for someone else to leave. Yes, definitely. Even at home alone sometimes I have to turn the sink on or the shower fan because it is too quiet and I guess I get paranoid. I do this too.", "freezing up in therapy I started therapy recently. My therapist is great and I feel pretty comfortable talking to her. In fact, it is a lot easier than I thought it would be. But of course I do struggle with certain topics; I just completely freeze up and cannot talk, my mind goes blank. etc.\n\nRecently my therapist suggested doing some role playing because I told her that I have a hard time with small talk. So she wanted to ask me basic questions (what is your name, where are you from, etc.) and then I would ask her the same things. I could not do it\u2026 at all. She literally asked what my name was and I could not say it. Then we did this scenario where we were at a book store and she was asking for book recommendations. I just could not say anything at all :/ I honestly could not even *remember* any books to talk about.\n\nIt is so frustrating! There are a lot of things that I want to tell my therapist and talk about, but I cannot do it and I hate that. Maybe I will try writing her a letter or something\u2026 I do not know. I just hate how hard this is for me. I wish my parents would have sought help for me when I was a kid. Instead, I am still struggling with this shit as an adult! It feels like it will never get better and that is beyong frustrating. Hang in there. Therapy is a marathon not a sprint! You are already doing so good by turning up and doing the work, even if you cannot see the results yet. It is super hard when you hit those blocks, but just keep pushing forward little by little. You might find sometimes you fall back, but that is normal too. It is an investment in your future happiness, even if it is frustrating right now. \n\nSmall talk is obviously an anxiety trigger for you. Hopefully you can work with your therapist to overcome that, step by step. \n\nYou will get there. Please be kind and gentle with yourself. My therapist's patience when I get stuck and cannot talk has been amazing and has really helped me feel a lot better about it. I had not realized, I think, how much I feel like other people judge me or hate being around me when I cannot talk, but being with someone who genuinely seems to be ok with it has probably been one of the most healing experiences I have had. I have written things for her when I want her to know things that I cannot say and she is been receptive to that. I do not really know, I am sure it depends on the therapist, but I hope you can keep going. Even if it does not \"get better,\" right away, I think it can feel really nice to be with someone who can just be with you, even if you cannot talk. It has for me, anyway. My therapist has been really awesome during periods where I freeze/cannot vocalize. We try to work around it with typing--either I text her and she responds out loud (short things, asking/answering small questions) or I type out my thoughts in a google doc on my phone and then pass it to her to read and respond aloud to (longer explanations, reflections, stories). Sometimes I shut down to the point that I cannot even type, and that is especially hard, but I really appreciate her patience/flexibility for the times when writing is a better form of communication for me than speaking aloud. Do you mind me asking what city your therapist is in? It is so hard for me to find one", "I need advice. I am meeting my brothers gf mum tomorrow and idk what to do!!?! Hi (f14) so I am meeting my brothers girlfriends mum tomorrow and I am so scared I do not know what to say or do. Having sm it is really hard.

Additionally, I hope I did not break any of the rules by this question.. \n\nI honestly want someone to talk to about SM with someone whose also undergoing this condition. I have talked to so many regular people about this, and I also get the same stupid reply. \"You just need to take the initation\" \" I was at one point shy like you.\" The amount of life it takes out of me. I literally cannot leave toxic relationships because of this disorder. Once i find someone comftorable to be around, i cant leave them even if they abuse me bc I feel like losing that relationship would be like losing my ability to speak. I really would love to talk with someone who can empathize with me, and someone who can carry out their journey alongside. I do not need a person to trauma dump. I just want someone whose along side me as equal.. \n\nAnyone willing to befriend me? \nI might not be the most humorous person, but I promise I am super nice.", "I just learned about selective mutism today. Do I have it? I am a first year law student and I find it ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to raise my hand to make a comment in class. In 4 years of undergrad and 2 years of grad school prior to this, I think I only raised my hand to speak once (In that situation, the professor was standing close to me which I think made the situation more comfortable).\n\nI have always described myself as having \u201csocial anxiety\u201d and more recently \u201csevere classroom anxiety\u201d because I do not feel like I truly have SAD. I can go to parties and strike up conversations with people. I just feel choked up about the thought of speaking in a classroom.\n\nDo I have select mutism? What do I do? I cannot really tell from the information you gave. But I do know, usually people with selective mutism are not going to be able to speak to people at parties they do not even know. Nonetheless, whether you have either selective mutism or just social anxiety disorder, I would try seeing a psychologist. They can diagnose and treat you. How did you do with presentations? ", "What Is the difference between giving the silent treatment and having selective mutism around family members? I have selective mutism in school and around strangers in general but am usually able to talk to my family with no problem. In fact my close family and friends are pretty much the only people I can talk to. Recently however I struggle to answer my parents when they ask me questions about my future that I do not know how to answer. I just freeze up and completely ignore them and when I try to answer I can only whisper so quietly that they do not hear and think I am still ignoring them. I have heard that ignoring someone who is trying to talk to you is called \"giving the silent treatment\" and is a very manipulative strategy used by narcissists to control people. I feel horroble for doing this but still cant stop. I was wondering though if this might actually just be my selective mutism even though I can talk to my parents normally most of the time. It is only when they ask me these stressful quiestions that I go silent.", "SM in adults (25 yo) I did not speak to anyone outside my immediate family until I was 16. I realized I needed to use my voice if I wanted to do anything in my life, so I forced myself to into situations where I would need to talk. In college, I had major anxiety talking in class or to groups of people, but I forced myself to do it anyways (and then came home and stressed about how stupid I sounded). Long story short, it was such a long and difficult process. I think I have been doing okay on a daily basis, but anytime I have to work in a group, I do not say a word. I do not know why, I just cannot get myself to speak and it takes me back to my childhood, where I did not say a word at all. I am 25 years old and I thought I had been doing well and today we had a group project (only 4 other people) and I could not get myself to say a single word the whole 3 hours. Is there any one out there that is able to function in daily life but then they have their moments where it feels like you took 10 steps backward because you are not able to do such a simple thing. Feeling really down and disappointed in my self today.. I had a situation where I could not find a group for a project in college. It took me three weeks to muster the courage and tell the professor. He had to assign me to someone is group. Every class in those three weeks I felt so diminished and worthless. Like you, it also made me remember what it was like to be in school again and it sucked. Hang in there \ud83d\ude09. 25 y/o here too. I definitely know where you are coming from. Unfortunately I do not have any good advice except to keep going at it. You have probably made a lot of progress already since you were 16 and it is ok to have times when your voice just does not come out. Everyone on this sub has been there I am sure. Try not to push yourself to the point it where it damages your mental health. Just go at your own pace and feel proud that you conquered the day when you do speak. Even on the days when you do not speak, the world keeps spinning anyway. Try not to beat yourself up too much. Wishing you the best \ud83d\ude0c I am 24, I am definitely doing fine daily life wise, but when I was still in college I never spoke a single word. I have not had any situation where I need to present something but I am pretty sure I will be super anxious and  will not talk either.. I am still working part time and I am too scared to look for jobs that is any type of office space where you would just be talking to people and have meetings and calls and etc...I just do not know what I would do I have no advice just want to say at 25 I had this exact same situation and my group was really annoyed at me when I had nothing to add. Im sorry Soon to be 34 and I still have days where I cannot say anything. The more I struggled against it the less I was able to say. I have just grown to accept that this is who I am and I will randomly talk to strangers. I surprise myself and I feel really proud for a long time. I am pretty much in the this exact situation, 25y as well and forced myself into a job that has me talking to people the entire day. The problem is I know what to say to people at my job because I know the work really well, but when it comes to regular conversations I freeze or give one word answers", "What is the SLP's Role with Children with Selective Mutism in the Schools? ", "Am I a selective mute? I only talk when I have to. I sometimes come up with funny jokes or good things to say but when the conversation hits, I am silent and only answer questions. It is possible. I can relate to that last part. For me I can form the words I want to say in my head, but then when it comes time to say them it is like a lump forms in my throat and blocks the words, and nothing comes out. You are responding to their questions verbally, right? Do you ever feel you are *unable* to respond verbally? does it count when it is because they are speaking in my second language which I DO speak fluently, but only to the point where it is difficult for me to argue back?  No, But sometimes when I want to say something. I cannot get it out. That could just be my social anxiety. Can you describe what goes through your mind when you cannot get it out? When I overcame my mutism, one of my problems was that I sometimes could not get things out, but it was because I was worried about what people would think of what I wanted to say. What would often happen internally, is that my mind would continuously iterate over some set of responses, in search of some optimum response. I would not find it though, so I would end up saying nothing. I am no authority, but I do not think so. In my mind, it is not mutism if you are able to respond. Finding it difficult to respond is different from being unable to respond. I would look for other opinions on this though. Wanting to say something but not being able to get it out would be selective mutism Not *entirely* true if you are talking about SM. There are different stages of SM. Some people with it are able to speak in the bare minimum. What is the bare minimum? Let us say only being able to speak if they are prompted first. It usually ends up being more quiet than intended, but it is still speaking nonetheless. Usually they are unable to initiate conversation, though, and they might also have a hard time giving answers to questions that require a very long response. So the more words they need to say, the harder it is, and the words just get stuck. I feel that man. I find I only feel the need to talk in certain circles if it is necessary, like at work. Otherwise I do not usually spark conversation or engage in it too much, mostly because surface level conversation is just boring and pointless. I am able to talk to my doctors (one on one) or with a person I trust in quiet places. Most of the time when I go to talk, it is either a super hoarse whisper or nothing at all. Like you though I can respond but it is different when people expect me to initiate, I often just sit in silence even though I want to say something. I just, cannot sometimes for example the other day I recycled some bottles and made exactly 10 dollars. When I handed in the reciept to the cashier. I was going to say \"exactly 10 dollars heh, makes the math easy.\" (I bought some sweets with the reciepts)\n\nBut I said nothing. I said hi and that was it. It is like I just decided last second to scrap the idea. But I wanted to say it. And I felt bad for caving to my fear of being judged it is like. Like my brain said \"why risk it?\" Even though I am fully aware I would not be judged and I would feel better about myself.\n\nThis happens a lot.", "I suffer both ways, what do I do? Everyone hates me if I talk cause I am a jerk to people when I am not writing or texting. But my mental health has taken a steep steep drop recently and i took a break from speaking a while back but everyone in my family hated me for it so that does not help the anxiety either. I know I can work on myself so that I am not a jerk when I talk but I have tried for 16 years to stop being an asshole to people and that is not possible my anxiety is simply to high and I either shut down or say rude things to people impulsively. Yeah really the only time I talk is when someone annoys me to the point where I am encouraged to actually speak out. I have been working on talking recently, and I also say rude things sometimes. I think it is because my brain kind of fogs up so I dont think things through very well. My advice is to immediately apologize and keep trying. Maybe start by having a neutral conversation where it is harder to say something rude, like talking about the weather.", "Take the 2020 r/selectivemutism General Survey!

Right now, I speak pretty muffled, but in practice/alone I can speak normally. This may be a general answer, but \"walking into the flame\" is the way to go. With that in mind, working on speaking louder would help more than prolonging conversation in that the anxiety that causes SM would be triggered more, which lessens it in the long term as long as you stay calm and keep at it. But the latter is important in itself as well. Yeah that would be my thinking too, because in my mind I feel I can hold a conversation, well at least support one.

Also, contact your teachers before school starts and make them aware that SM is not a choice for you and that you are not being rude/clueless if they do happen to call on you.

Recently I have been applying for many jobs around my area and I got an interview at Wendy\u2019s. I know it is just a simple 30 minute interview, not like a business professional interview but I have grown very anxious and nervous. I was told to just go into the store at XX time on XX date but... I do not know who I should talk to when the day comes. When I enter the store, who should I ask for? What if they do not take me in for the interview? How should I act and talk during the interview? What should I say? I just really want a job but it is hard to get one as a person with anxiety and SM. I just hope I do not wimp out at the last moment and just want some advice. I understand so much of the anxiety thinking about that day and what you have to do beforehand and everything, but usually when the time comes, it is much more simple than you think! I would just tell anyone who work there \u201cI am here for an interview\u201d and they will probably take you to the person in charge :) \nI personally have not had any type of formal interview so I am not much of a help there.. If there is anyone who is nice and train you well, you will be fine! Good luck! Show up ten minutes before the start time. Approach the first worker you see and say excuse me, I am here for an interview. Stand in the line to order if you have to. They will know who to tell. Be prepared to wait longer than expected as the person in charge is usually busy. Just try to relax, smile and make eye contact when you are speaking. Eventually they will ask you how would you deal with a customer who is being very rude, to this say you would just give them the benefit of the doubt and that you never know what someone is going through, and that you would not take any of it personally.

I have dated before but I have a hard time expressing emotion I think because of my selective mutism and I cannot initiate relationships. But there is a guy who I really like, we are friends but I cannot even start conversations with him because my selective mutism is pretty severe. Does anyone have advice for telling him I like him? Eye contact and a smile. I know it is hard, but eye contact says alot and if you can hold it for a couple seconds it can convey alot of emotion, a nice smile goes a long way and if you do this for a couple days and say just a small 'hello' in passing he might strike up a conversation. I have the same problem too! But remember speaking is not the only way to communicate; body language (eye contact, touch, facial expression, etc) and texting can help a lot! If the other person understands your situation, then I am sure he would not mind you texting or writing to him in person if you are comfortable with that also. When you are not physically with him, you can always express your feeling through texting. This may be purely anecdotal, but I thought I would share my experience. I am mostly recovered SM, but still have a lot of day-to-day social anxiety. I used to be super nervous around guys my age, way more so than with girls, to the point that I would experience SM \u201cflare ups\u201d even as a teenager when trying to talk to guys, despite being mostly recovered in all other situations.\n\nIn college, I went on a few Tinder dates and was incredibly nauseous, awkward, and socially inept the whole time.

It is just like how people with SM might be comfortable talking to their parents but not their teachers, or friends their age but not older people, etc. Each type of relationship has its own dynamic that is more or less \u201ctriggering\u201d (for lack of a better word). \n\nI think for people with SM, those firsts in a relationship are naturally going to be harder, and expressing your feelings will be difficult in the beginning. But do not be discouraged or feel like you cannot foster a romantic relationship, because once you create that new dynamic with someone, it will be different than your relationship with anyone else.", "Cannot think of what to say unless someone asks me a question I had this issue for a while.

When someone suddenly talks to me, I start getting a little nervous and my mind goes into a state of overdrive. \n\nPeople always asked me if im okay. When someone asks a question, I feel obligated to answer it because it seems  important. I usually never comment on people's success or compliment them in any way. I do not talk about things I think are meaningless to me. Those things do not come in my mind anyways. \n\nI am a quiet and introverted person. Never had many friends in school either. I am also a slow thinker and talker. I mostly talk to myself or my parents at home. Outside home, my mind goes blank and my voice starts to become quieter when speaking.

I am just like; how? how the hell are you doing this? \nAnd it is also like when I do get asked questions I panic and just get super awkward and yeah no it sucks. Me in uncomfortable situations This is what I was like for a long time. When I was young even answering questions was difficult, as I grew up questions became the easiest part and thinking of something to say from nothing was hard. Now as long as I am reasonably relaxed in a situation then starting the conversation is possible, but I find that the blank mind thing was definitely anxiety related. \n\nEventually got diagnosed with autism at 27 years old though. I never pursued a diagnosis for SM because by this age I had managed to work through a lot of it, and mainly struggle when I am burnt out/stressed/overwhelmed. I was diagnosed with autism when I was 17. I am 19 now and I am still struggling with socializing and speaking up. I am never going to say it is an easy thing to change, I think Ive been lucky in many aspects of how I have managed to improve things. \n\nI enjoyed spending time figuring things out and because I was undiagnosed I always just thought I had not spent as much time figuring this whole \"conversation\" thing out as other people and just needed practice. \n\nSo I read up on how to have conversations, and combined with working in restaurants and somewhat unhealthily using alcohol as a crutch, managed to get to a point where I could navigate social situations reasonably well. Most of this happened from around 17-21, but I did not really get comfortable in myself until I was probably 25+. I think learning what is expected and what works in social situations can be helpful, but it is more important to work through and understand what causes the anxieties in the first place. \n\nThere is so much to work through for this I could write endlessly, but figuring out what really makes you anxious in conversations/social interactions (a lot of the time it is just the unpredictability) and trying to figure out what you can do to work on those is where to start. Just take it small steps at a time. One thing that took me years to work out is that you are allowed to just take a second to breath and think about what is being said and how you want to respond, there is only usually a rush in your own head. Exactly how my life has been! I only truly feel comfortable with my twin sister and my childhood friend. I feel so bad for myself and the people I want to befriend.

(sorry I do not know how to word that)\n\nLike this girl that I was friends with asked my brother that. Even when I have had full on conversations with her. \n\nAnd people will just walk by me. I guess thanking it not lesioning. Or that I cannot understand them. But i can. So I find out a lot of stuff. Lol. \n\nAnyone else do that? I think because the majority of the time people only come across mutism in someone who has lower functioning autism and is thus nonverbal. So they make that connection in their head and make an assumption, whether they realize it or not. That is just a theory though. It happened to me a lot, and people would to the point where it was painfully obvious, decrease their vocabulary around me and talk in a high pitched voice as if I would understand better. I found it harder so speak to those people as well, so to anyone who knows someone who has SM...please do not do this. Yes, I experienced this as well Yeah I felt like people treated me like a young child when I was in high school I had a principle (not mine) start speaking sign language to me and talking as if I am HOH.. and I got yelled at constantly for not saying anything Yep. That has happened to me lots of times, but I do not really mind unless it is said in a really rude way. I can accept things like \u201cDo you want (insert thing here), sweetie?\u201d Or anything else since I do not have to talk, but anything other than that, I do not tolerate. This happens to me though not as often. One time I was sitting at this four person table and they kept asking me questions and I would nod or shake my head in response. Then one of the girls asked if I knew english and i nodded my head yes. She then proceeded to tell the people in the table that I probably did not know english. People sometimes assume I just do not know english and yeah it is my second language but I have been in the US since the first grade godammit Yes, this happens to me. A lot of teachers have favoritism to me and it is very embarrassing People in middle school and sometimes in high school would act like I could not hear them or something. They would talk about how weird I was when I was sitting right next to them.\n\nOr people would pretend to be my friend just because they thought it was funny to see if they could get me to talk. It makes me very suspicious and distrustful of friendships now People used to tell substitute teachers that I spoke spanish when I ddint answer loud enough for the attendance. I am not Hispanic but a lot of people think I am because I am 1/4 black, 1/4 korean, and 1/2 white", "I am slowly losing my reason to speak.

But feel free to say if I have signs of it or something.\nAnyways.\nI do not want to speak anymore. I find my words troublesome more than anything else right now. Communicating is not \"hard\" but I do not like talking to anyone unless I have to. I find social situations nerve wracking at times and I easily get overwhelmed by noise and people around me. I cannot stand the sound of my own voice sometimes. Went to a birthday party recently and I just went quiet cause of how overwhelming it was. I can barely even find the drive to talk anymore.

If you are able to write, you can always bring a pencil/pen and a notebook with you, and just use that when they ask an open ended question. Or, if you are too frozen for that, what I usually do is simply shrug. It is better than not responding at all.

I just was not sure if people would think its weird Yeah that is the only bad part of writing to communicate. You stand out.

It was great, I listened to music on the way there...of course I am super self conscious and only listen to it loudly on the highway. We get 1 pass done after about 2 hours of waiting and get our time slips, so we go back to the line, and we have to go to the specific line 3...so we can race against eachother. Apparently we had skipped the line, but the staff let us by.\n\nAnd my Dad is very overly cautious of other people, he would never inconvenience anyone purposefully, which it annoys me that is how anal he is about it. And this guy in his car is yelling at us because \"we skipped the line...\" and technically yes we did, though we had no clue, we were confused the hustle and bussle.

Eventually I will meet good people and when I do, they will be worth my life.\n\nAnd I understand their anger, but the lack of understanding is what annoyed me, we are people....come talk to my dad before just assuming us to be 'assholes who cut the line.' I get that someone being skipped makes me feel worthless in the sense and that is where the emotion comes from. \n\nIt really cut deep, I wanted to cry but I stopped myself, closed my fucking windows because people were pissing me off and did not open them again until 15mins later when my dad wanted to tell me something to me on the line. I thought how being angry and potentially crashing would just be what the guy angry at me would be hoping for....so I changed my thoughts and went in there trying to do my best.\n\nAlthough I just spun the tires but I did not crash.

Wondering if any of you have had or considered a therapy dog to help. Was just a thought I was batting around. Thanks for any input. I am scared of dogs but if I could find one that would not scare me I would consider adopting it but even if I wanted to I cannot because my family does not want pets I have lots of pets. I consider all of them to be therapy animals, but only two are registered as comfort companions. They always help me with anxiety, depression and even will come up and comfort you if you are crying.\n\nI would definitely recommend a therapy pet. I can sometimes take a pet with me, like if I have to take public transportation, and they definitely help keep me calm.. I do not have any registered therapy dogs but I have always had pets, cats and dogs! They are great just to be around and bring so much happiness! A trained and registered therapy animal companion can be insanely expensive.  Our son does not have sm, but is autistic, and he loved big dogs.  Alas, we adopted a lovely and random dog who was not a therapy animal, and the dog fell in love with my husband and not my son.  My son has since switched allegiances to cats, and our scaredy cat has become his special someone.  \n\nI had sm as a child, and I was always bonded to cats.  It is like, they never needed me to say anything, but loved me and were there for me just the same. My son's SM progressed to the point of him not talking at all, even at home, throughout 2nd grade. But, we thought we caught him talking to my parents' dogs a few times that year. Unfortunately we could not really afford a dog ourselves until the end of that school year, but we adopted our dog (not a registered therapy animal) in May and within a month my son was talking at home again! By the start of the next school year, he was talking to my parents and a few others again, too! \n\nTl;dr, I am pro-pet if it is a viable option for you.

I was recently on a video call with around 40 people. I really wanted to be there, even though I knew it was likely I would just be observing mostly. I mean, with that many people on a call together all most people are doing is observing, right? \n\nWell, during one part they broke into smaller groups to play a game, a game I really like, but the game required some speaking, and I was not up to it. So, I tried typing my answers, but I quickly realized that no one was paying attention to the chat and therefore I ended up just sitting there, muted, feeling awkward and left out. \n\nEventually, the whole group came back together, there was some informational stuff and then they closed things up, but they invited people to stick around a catch up for a bit if they wanted to afterwards. I stayed on because I did not have anything better to do, and with the quarantine I am alone 95% of the time. \n\nMany people left, some people were chatting, and I was just observing. I was doodling on an index card that I had on my desk. And suddenly someone that had been in my small group (we do not know each other) said, \"I want to hear anelephantinthegloom speak.\" And I started panicking internally and immediately, but nonchalantly, turned off my camera (my mic was already off). And they said something like, \"Oh, I scared them off.\"\n\nI did not want to leave though, I did not know what to do. I felt so embarrassed and just kind of sat there listening and watching until everyone else left. \n\nIt is still bothering me. I know they meant well, they did not seem to be trying to call me out. It came across as encouragement, like they wanted to give me the opportunity to speak. I just cannot get it out of my head. \n\nI was trying to convince myself that I could still be a part of what was happening even if my participation was limited to observation. I did not think it would make a difference because most of the people did not know me anyway. But the comment made me realize that people noticed, even in a large group, that I was different. I was singled out. \n\nLike I said, I know the intention was not to harm or embarrass, but it was a difficult moment.\n\nAnyone else feeling singled out in video chats? I am recovered now, but I will absolutely *never* forget the awful feeling that follows being told \u201cI want to hear you talk\u201d or \u201cwhy do not you talk?.\u201d I know they probably did not have bad intentions, like you said, but it was always really dreaded. \n\nThankfully my schools video calls are optional, so I have always avoided them at all costs.

Long story short, my parents did not do much about it since I was outspoken at home. Everybody around me thought I would grow out of it, but I never thought that, and over the years, doing more research, I accepted my fate (while trying desperately to run away from it). I have never planned for a life after university, because what the hell can you do in society with this disorder?? For years, I have thought: when I get to university, I will have no friends, be studying something I give absolutely no shits about (because I have had depression so long that I dont have any interests or aspirations) and I will end up taking my life before I have to face being an adult. Almost done my second semester and all that is pretty true. But its so scary to be here. I knew I would be here, but it is scary.

Is it ok if I speak to a person with selective mutism anyway? I have had a student for 3 years now and I have always felt that when I talk to him that I had to keep it very short and to the point so that he did not have to respond. Just be informed. Not questioned. He has talked to me maybe two or three times before and it was a near whisper and quick (1 sentence), I am proud of him for even that!!\n\nHow do people with selective mutism feel when people do talk to them (without expecting any response)? Is it anxiety inducing? Rude? Annoying? Fine? Anticipated? \n\nI would appreciate some clarity on that. Thank you. Yes, of course. I actually really love being talked to, as long as they do not ask ridiculously open ended questions and try to force me to respond. So it is best to ask direct yes/no questions that they can respond to by nodding or shaking their head, or possibly by verbally saying yes or no if they are comfortable enough. About 95% of all questions can be rephrased into a yes/no question if you think hard enough about it. True true. Thank you so much for responding. \n\nSo it is anxiety around verbal speech and not so much written communication as you are doing here right? \n\nI usually just try to keep it positive and short to allow him a way out if he does not feel like being talked to today. I wave hi and smile and keep it at that. I love it when people talk to me (without expecting a response). It makes me feel like a human being, something that people with Selective Mutism often do not feel due to social isolation. It depends on the person. Some cannot write or guesture. You will have to see what they are comfortable with. Some may want to be left alone, others may like listening and not being left out. Personally, I longed for people to speak to me normally, even when I could not reply. It feels awful when people just start treating you like you are invisible. It just lowers already low self-esteem. I constantly battle with the idea that my very presence is bothering people, even now long after I recovered from SM.\n\nSocial isolation is an awful side effect of SM. Talking as normally as you can might help your student. Leaving gaps for him to speak, but without expecting him to speak could help. But it depends on him. You can listen to him, even if he is not saying things with words. Like the person above me said, SM does affect nonverbal communication as well, so not everyone with SM can write. Not only does SM cause your vocal cords to be paralyzed, but their muscles can be paralyzed/frozen as well, making movement impossible. In that case, communication by nodding is the easiest, and writing is the most difficult. So nodding is the most common form of communication for SMers. But note that there is even some SMers who are so severe that they cannot do nod. So my point is, it depends on the person. Most SMers appreciate being spoken to, and generally enjoy it, but there are some who prefer to be left alone. I see. Thank you for the feedback I see. Thank you! I am so glad to hear that! Thank you for responding True true. Thank you for responding. It does suck. Even as extrovert (ENFP) I experience social anxiety sometimes. It feels so nice when teachers actually talk to me! Most of my teachers do not and it often makes me feel isolated/ignored. Yes/no questions are your best bet, but if he is ok with written conversations, that is also very good! Just be patient with what he is trying to write. I have had teachers try to guess what I am writing before I am done, or even move on completely and forget that they were talking to me. It feels like I am being too slow, or that they do not care. Patience is the most important part with someone who has SM. Glad to hear that \ud83d\ude0a", "Anyone else do this?

It is always my first reaction and I cannot do anything to stop it...", "Does anyone else wish youcould go back to being a kid when it was more acceptable foryou to not talk much?o I remember in kindergarten people might have thought it was little weird but all little kids are weird, so kids would just talk to me anyway and eventually I would get to know them well enough to talk to them too. But the older I got the, the less acceptable it was to not talk. Things got worse when I had to switch schools and the kids there were not used to me but talking. I have been depressed since about 4th grade because of this I am sorry you had to go through that. I had a different experience, I grew up on an island, a small island so the older I got the more people accepted it and the more I was able to speak. My younger years were terrible, bullies both children and adults. \n\nI would never want to go back to those years when adults made my life miserable because they could not understand our accept that a child was not speaking because they could not. Where children purposely made fun of me because I could not speak or would take advantage because they knew I could not tell. Being a kid was really amazing, not just because I could to talk to my friends, but because we played together more than we talked. In middle school this completely changed, they talked all the time and I, unfortunatelly, could not get along with them. So I started to get alone in the breaks and could not really make friends. I was judged harshly by adults for not talking, so I do not remember it being acceptable. \n\n(Not sure if my anxiety was full blown mutism, though.) I had to move as a kid, too, when I was 10. That is when things started getting really hard for me. Not just the big change, but also the fact that it is the age where you should be developing certain social skills, but I did not.\n\nI do not wish I could go back to being a kid, though.

At worst people would sometimes think I was rude.\nHowever I knew I was more quiet than anyone else I knew/had seen, even people who would say they are shy but they 'managed to overcome it' and I just never really could.\nI think there are SOME positives to this; I am creative and love writing because I am so much 'in my own little world'.\nI do not understand it because when I cannot think of what to say, like I literally just do not know 'how' to speak, even though I know I Can at other times...

I do not even mean being loud, but just... Less quiet?\nI just do not know how.\nAny advice? I do not know how much this would help but, I have taken to now whenever I cannot speak even though I know what I want to say, first showing whoever I am trying to communicate with a pre written note on my phone that says I go mute sometimes and that I am really not trying to be funny or rude. I will then start using my phone to type out what I am saying instead of trying to talk, I find it a little easier than writing, and I will usually keep some emotes in there to try and keep some level of emotion in my \"voice\" I am using. I do not know if this will work for you as everyone here has different levels of difficulty with different forms of communication but this is what works for me. \n\u256e(\u2022 \u00d7\u2022)\u256d Wow, finally someone who has the same view as me in this sense What do you mean?

I only learned about this yesterday and never even knew SM was a thing.\nI have always had trouble speaking to authority figures or in front of groups of more than two, as well as expressing emotions when I am at school.\n\nJust last week, in my class, we were put into binary groups and had to do a social psychology experiment, then when we were put into quadrads, suddenly I could not speak or move my face - I just stared at the ground the whole time that we had our froup discussion and fumbled over my words when my teammates asked me questions.\n\nLast year I had trouble doing class presentations: my voice would quaver and my right leg would shake uncontrollably. Admittedly, however, my leg did not do that last presentation, so I think I am getting better, though I did stutter a lot and my mind went blank a couple of times during my talk\n\nI am not able to make eye contact with people, and for as long as I remember, the people I have always had the most trouble talking to are my crushes. I remember my last crush asked me why I never said anything and why I never smile. Then she said I was a robot, and that really hurt my feelings. I realised that the people around me do not really see me as another human being. A lot of people started calling me a robot. \n\nSometimes people hear me talk and are surprised and did not even know I could talk. In school, when teachers asked me questions, I just shrugged my shoulders or stared at them in the eye until they moved on from me. \n\nWhenever I enter school, just being physically *inside* the buidling makes my entire body go slack and my facial expressions stunted. People around me laugh when something funny happens but I have a hard time doing the same. I do not have friends bc people think I do not like them, bc I never smile at them.\n\nIdk. I am 17 rn and my mom has always told me that I am just timid. I have had select mutism since I was a child but was not diagnosed till I was about 16 I believe. While I cannot diagnose you, it sounds like you do have social anxiety at least. I cannot tell if it is select mutism because idk how long this has been a thing for you and whether or not you are completely fine and able to verbally express yourself around those who are either family or close friends. \n\nThe part that stands out to me and may hint to you possibly having SM is the physical incapability to speak when you try or want to. Most of the time when I try to speak/respond to someone I end up just sitting there and staring because my mouth literally just will not open. It is like my tongue is being held down and I cannot for the life of me get myself to make a sound. Most of my SM is in public spaces and in school. Only a handful of people have heard my voice. I only talk to the relatives that I live with. \n\nIf this is a hindering issue for you then I would suggest seeing a professional such as a therapist or psychiatrist or both! My school counselor was actually the one who referred me with the concern of SM. \n\nBest of wishes! I can speak to close relatives and sometimes to people who do not know a thing about me (e.g., homeless people, mostly), as long as it is not in a school building. And yea, I do have that constraint you are talking about - cannot utter a word for the life of me despite wanting to speak. Yeah there is a possibility you could have it. I too can talk to people who do not know me but it is more because I will most likely never see them again. I cannot order my own food or ask for an extra napkin but if someone asks for directions then I will be able to speak. It is out of my control though. That is the key part of having SM. People will have the misconception of \u201cYou just do not want to speak / you are choosing not to speak\u201d or even label you as having a behavioral problem. I would definitely seek professional opinion if it is bothering you or causing too much of a limit in your life.", "Any suggestions for working with SM children?

No matter what you decide to do, you would have to get a degree in psychology though, obviously. There are some psychologist that specialize in working with children as well as specialization for sm. I do not really know that much, but the practice my therapist is in has some that specialize in those feilds.

A lot of people think that those with selective mutism choose not to speak. That is not true. I am a situation where someone with SM does not speak, it is because the anxiety gets so bad that your entire body just freezes and even just walking, coughing, sneezing etc can be very difficult because of the anxiety. \nAs a kid I used to describe it like this: it feels like there is a troll in my head that has the key to a door in my throat and when I am in a situation where I am unable to speak the troll closes the door and locks it and refuses to unlock it until I am \"safe\"(I.e. in a situation where I am able to speak).\n\nAnother very common misconception is that selective mutism is a form of autism. I have even met doctors and therapists who believed this. I do not remember a lot of that myself, since I was so small, but my parents have told me about it. I was diagnosed with SM when I was 3 or 4 years old. Then when my parents tried to find someone who could help with therapy/treatment etc the therapists wanted to give me the same therapy/treatment as someone with autism gets, because they had no idea what selective mutism is and mutism and autism sound a lot alike. The difference is, when you have autism you say/do things that other people might find very rude, because you are not able to pick up on body language/social queues. With selective mutism you are constantly looking at people's body language and constantly worried that you will say something that will be misunderstood or that they think you are weird etc etc, you are overthinking about the things that people with autism are not able to think about (I am just repeating what a former therapist told me). So giving someone with SM the same therapy as someone with autism obviously would just not help at all. \n\nI hope this helps\ud83d\ude05 if you have any questions, feel free to ask here or in a message, I am happy to help!\ud83e\udd17 Hello, I had selective mutism when I was younger. It varies from person to person of course but I want to tell you my experience. I only spoke to my immediate family members. I would be scared to talk to my own uncle who I rarely saw. I would talk to a family friend but refuse to speak to her mom. I remember one day when she told the girl who I would talk to that she would buy me candy if she heard me speak. i wanted to speak so terribly in 3rd grade but I was so afraid that people would make a big deal out of it once I started speaking so my 3rd grade teacher announced to the class that I would start talking and not to make a big deal out of it.  I had SM when I was younger. I would whisper into one girls ear to ask to do things like go to the bathroom. My grade 1 teacher did not know how to cope with it and decided to sit me in a chair and yell (screaming) at me to say a word. I was not allowed to do anything...the rest of the class laughed at me as my teacher scared and humiliated me. I was not able to tell my parents because I was so traumatized and this continued on for weeks until my teacher gave up. I eventually figured out that all the staff discussed what to do and thought this method would be the best thing for me. That is definitely is not a good method ahaha!", "Does selective mutism go away? I was never formally diagnosed as my parents were not the type to push for something like that but I have a STRONG feeling I had selective mutism as a child I mean I was literally mute and could not say a word even when spoken to by any adult outside my immediate family.. when school started I would communicate minimally with some peers but never adults until about age 12 (I am now 22) ... but around that time I started to be able to make myself speak to adults and peers at least to answer questions or give responses I was still definitely very quiet and had social anxiety as well as general anxiety but not mute anymore. So is this something that can subside after childhood or would it be considered something else because I can speak now? hey there! sorry for the short answer (at work rn),  yes it goes away. But as everything it takes time and effort, and something to keep in mind is that you not only have to treat SM, but also what most of the time comes with SM, like social anxiety. if you do not have access to profesional help, a good first step would be to start by the resources here: ( \n\ngood luck! feel free to PM if you want to chat. It can go away with practice of these skills. I do not know if anxiety naturally subsides, I had meningitis and that helped for a couple years, but more people also thought I was an asshole because the brain damage took away my ability to give a fuck. Not naturally, if it gets treated then yes. It is not an easy progress tho :c", "How to deal with this as an adult? I have only recently discovered this was a thing and it explains a lot. I am an adult and I still have the exact same issues as when I was a child. I cannot speak in most group situations, or to new people unless it is a planned context (e.g. a meeting to discuss a specific thing). I have literally 0 friends and 0 acquaintances and only talk to one person. This also affects me online or through emails I get too anxious. \n\nI am angry that no one ever saw it as an issue, probably because my grades were good, and that is all that matters to them. Teachers were always complaining that I never participate. I have also recently been diagnosed with autism and adhd, my mother suspected but is strongly anti-doctor and assumed I would grow out of it. I did not, same with this.\n\nIt has impacted so much of my life and I have missed out on so many opportunities just because I cannot communicate when I want. People have told me I appear hostile when I am actually in a state of intense panic but come across completely emotionless. \n\nI do not know what to do, I hate this and want to get rid of it but I do not know where to start. I have improved slightly as I am starting to be able to do online communication (like this post) as I was not a few months ago. But speaking has not improved and has arguably gotten worse since I was younger. How can I get better? there is a page in the wiki with providers  \n\nA lot of treating professionals that treat children may also have experience treating adults. Especially the professionals that have been working with SMers for many years.\n\nWe have a discord server if you would like to further practice talking online \n\nI am active around both here and the discord. We can try to find someone that can help you together.\n\nGetting comfortable with online communication is as good a start as any. Being able to ask for help online and make emails is your link to the outside world. Not that it matters but if you are on the autism spectrum you would likely not be diagnosed with SM. I know nothing about autism but they have to rule it out before you get a sm diagnosis. I said that to say I am sure there is other support for people with autism as sm support may not help you. I have read contradictory things about this. Some places say that they cannot both be diagnosed (this seems to be the case on an official level), but others say they are extremely comorbid. Regardless, I am certain that a great deal of my issue with communication stems from anxiety. Sometimes it is the case that I am silent because I do not want to speak. But, when I actually want to, it causes intense stress and I cannot do it. Which seems to be in line with selective mutism. Good luck on your journey. It is a tough go. I am the parent of a kid with sm and I have a huge fear of her not learning to cope before she is an adult.  There is help out there It was also recent that I came to realize I might have SM. I knew what I was experiencing was anxiety-related but I could not pin point what it was. I understand how challenging it is and it can get very frustrating when you just want to live normally by being able to communicate without difficulty. \n\nFirst, try not to fight it. Acknowledge that people naturally experience anxiety but it is heightened for some. I also came across advice suggesting to randomly think of the worst things that can happen (death, accidents). I know it does not sound helpful initially, but when you think about them, you realize that you are alive and safe at this moment, which shows you that your current fears are insignificant. Third, I noticed that my anxiety stems from fear of being judged and seen. Despite having good grades all through out schooling years, I was mostly quiet and had very few friends. In relation to this, I find comfort in the idea that people have their own issues to actually be unnecessarily focusing on me and what I might be doing wrong. When you worry about what people might think about that idea of yours, stop caring too much (that is what I tell myself). After all, everything is temporary.\n\nI am still in the process of trying to manage my anxiety through natural means (meditation, energy healing, supplements) and I am not familiar with how your condition is connected with adhd, but I hope that you find these helpful somehow I am somewhat in the same boat as you. Its frustrating to think that people saw that there was a problems but did do anything. I know this is not the best advise but the best thing that helped me was just having a job and talking to people. I think the best thing would be to just start talking with someone you see on the daily or weekly. I hope things start getting better for you. It is good you have managed to improve. Currently things are worse than usual anxiety-wise but back around this time last year I was talking to a couple of people as I had to for university work. Oddly enough, I was able to in real life but not by message. I think I was able because they did not interact with me differently like most others do so was not stressed to the same extent. I do not think it did, but even if it helped at the time, I have definitely regressed so have to start from even before the beginning now... Thanks for the advice. I automatically end up thinking of all the worst things that can happen and it definitely does not seem to help. I hate attention (strangely, except for performing, but it is a more controlled and expected attention so maybe that explains it) and am trying to convince myself that others do not really care what I am doing but it is hard and no matter how many times I think that, I never actually believe it. How did you get yourself to stop caring as much? I see, maybe skip that one if it does not seem to help. Not caring too much does not come naturally since I am more of the sensitive type (if you are familiar with the MBTI personality test). Thus, I try ways to condition my mind. I think that anxiety has a lot to do with anticipation of the future, and deliberately trying to live in the present somehow grounds me. When I tend to hold my thoughts over fear of being judged, I tell myself that keeping them to myself means that I am not being my authentic self ~ and being true to oneself is necessary to feel liberated and it is also the only way one could find his/her real tribe. \n\nSomeone also suggested that I imagine myself 10 years from now thinking about my current situation, then ask myself if it is something that would matter, because often the answer is no.\n\nI have also tried guided meditations to help quiet my mind. A medical doctor recommended that I take L-theanine and valerian root food supplements - they are not prescription drugs so they are generally safe to take to aid anxiety. I know people\u2019s recommendations are usually easier said than done and what works for me might not work for others, but baby steps are little victories, nonetheless", "Is this common for selective mutism kids?  concerned for her\n\n\nMy younger sister is ten and I am watching her most of the time when my parents work. She clearly feels guilt and shame- she accidentally stole a pencil and cried for a long time. She hates shows like America\u2019s funniest home videos because she hates seeing others her hurt.\n\nBut she is a little weird with the dog. She will put the dog at the top part of the couch and watch it walk down and it is really hard for the dog Bc the dog has to be extremely balanced and falls. She always catches the dog if she falls. She places treats on the highest row of a shelf and makes the dog repeatedly jump on her tippy toes to get it. She will place the dog in the shelves and stuff as if the dogs in a maze. She hates seeing others hurt or distressed but it is almost like she likes watching the dog struggle or something- she puts the dog in situations where the dog has to be careful and she likes watching.  She does pick the dog up and spin her around. \n\nWhat would cause this Sensitivity is not a part of the diagnostic criteria for SM, but its common in children with any form of mental illness or disability.\n\nThe dog thing is odd though, and does not really relate to the Sensitivity thing or sm symptoms. Does she understand it hurts the dog or have any other mental health/disability issues that might affect how she relates to the dog? Not to my knowledge! Do you think it could be adhd or something? Definitely not related to SM, or ADHD. Is it possible she has autism? Hm well adhd runs in our family and I do not know much about it but it could make her look for excitement. I did not think handling animals poorly could relate to autism? But she does not seem to be autistic- she is always with friends and seems happy and bubbly.\n\nShe does seem to show a lot of emotion. I do think there was one time she might have stepped on the dog when it was acting bad because she was mad. She reacts to thinks like this. Like she has a large Barbie doll and she tripped over it and it cut her lip. She cried first and then screamed about wanting the Barbie gone- than made us bring it back. This was when she was younger though like 6/7 As a dog lover, this does not sound that abnormal to me. Many dogs love to be challenged especially for treats. This sounds like a DIY doggie obstacle course. \n\nAm I missing something? Does dog hate it or something? The dog seems miserable about it sometimes Bc sometimes she put the treat so high that the dog is standing almost straight up on it is hind legs in a way where the dogs clearly distressed She is only 10 so maybe she just does not understand that the dog is distressed. Have you tried explaining to her that it is bad for the dogs legs to do this?", "Anyone got any fanfiction on SM Anyone got any fanfiction on having selective mutism? I have seen a couple about snufkin (from moomin) on ao3 but I cannot remember the names I saw some in the Pok\u00e9mon fandom with Red having selective mutism. I think the \u2018Selectively Mute Red\u2019 tag on AO3 has a bit. Lots of *Legend of Zelda* fics have Link as mute, although it is not always SM, or not specified. For those that do specify, the tag on AO3 is (\n\nTwo of my favorites: ( and its sequel, ( In both, Link cannot speak when extremely stressed, but it only comes up once or twice in each fic.", "Question: whether you have SM or not, how or where did you first learn of this condition? SM is little known or fully understood, and even though I have suffered from it my whole life, I only discovered this anxiety disorder has a name last year after going down a rabbit hole of research. Since it is not widely known or recognized, I am curious to hear other people\u2019s stories about discovering SM. TikTok lol. Though I do not use TikTok for research While working as a programmer for a healthcare software company. I was searching through ICD-9/10 codes and found it and then researched it after that. Oh interesting! Haha wow yeah probably not the best place for research but definitely interesting you found it there lol At 6 my teacher bullied me, and said I was a disrespectful kid, because I never answer her questions. My mom knew that I was a good kid though, so she was confused. I would come home after a day of no speaking, and flip out, and yell and scream until the next day. My parents were worried about me, so they went through therapist after therapist, and after 42 therapists we found out it was selective mutism. Wow 42 therapists! That is a lot! That story is kind of similar to mine in the way that around the time I started school (age 5) my teacher noticed I was not really taking to anybody and I had to see the school counselor (which btw only made the problem worse because that counselor was AWFUL.) I went through about 12 years of school not talking as the problem never got properly fixed, and just last year I discovered SM has a name. I feel like therapists/counselors are not really trained to diagnose SM, as it is pretty rare, but it should still be more widely known so people like us could have been treated earlier on and moved past this. Thanks for sharing your story! I learnt about it through a book Oh cool! Do you remember the title? Girl In Pieces. It is not about selective mutism, but the main character is supposed to have it. I also went down a rabbit hole, but I officially found it through a documentary. oo i remember also a book called a quiet kind of thunder has a main character with sm as well if you are interested :) i was interested in pursuing aba and becoming an rbt and then i started reading how its actually harmful and i realized i knew nothing about autistic people so i looked more into that and felt like i related to a lot of characteristics so then i was researching more about autism and specifically in girls and i read about selective mutism and had a like epiphany moment i was like wait this describes me perfectly I have it on my reading list! Have your read it? And if so, did you enjoy it? i read it a while ago and at the time i actually did not connect that i also had selective mutism so i didnt read it as critically in that aspect but i remember i enjoyed it! \ni think the premise behind it is super cute! a girl with sm is struggling with loneliness and the pressure to speak but meets a deaf boy and they start using other ways to communicate (writing, typing, sign language) and its cool because they bond a ton and the main girl is able to realize that communication can be more than verbally speaking so it is pretty cool Yeah at first I was looking at the autism in girls research too, but SM applied to me in every aspect of the disorder. Oh wow adding both of those titles to my list. i agree! i personally dont think i am autistic and the certain autistic characteristics i related to were just from my sm The autism in girls research is SO limited compared to boys, so that makes it hard to determine for sure. So frustrating for sure! when i started looking at specifically autism in girls then i related to a lot more of the content than just autism in general my little brother got diagnosed with it, I love him so much. I want to learn as much as I can about it, so I can do the most to help him. \u2764\ufe0f  I first heard the term on tumblr and thought it described me and decided to do some actual research and everything I learned just sounded exactly like me I first heard of the term \u201cselective mutism\u201d in a book called The Secret Voice of Gina Zhang. The book was given to me by my 5th grade teacher for some reason, who said I could keep it for as long as I wanted. At the time, I did not know I had selective mutism, so I just thought the book was interesting but otherwise did not think much more of it. Then, in the very beginning of 6th grade, I had an assignment, in which a parent had to write a letter in 100 words or less about their child. In that assignment, my mom wrote that I had selective mutism, which no one had ever told me about. I literally went through my whole life thinking I was just really really shy, but then I found out there was actually a name for what I had?? After that, I just did a lot of research on it, and I totally related to everything I read. Now that I look back, if I had done research on SM back when I would first read about it in 5th grade, I would have found out a lot sooner. But anyway, now I am just curious how my teacher knew about that book, or why he decided to give it to me, or if he knew I had selective mutism back then. I guess I will never know, but I am grateful to him. I was curious of what the hell was up with me growing up and I cannot remember what article I was reading about initially but I saw selective mutism included in it and was like .. what is that..? Holy crap it was like reading a transcript of my life. I am glad I was finally able to figure it out and that I was not alone in feeling that way. Things are a lot easier to deal with when you realize that you are not alone in your struggles, even if you do not have an immediate person in your life who understands, there are many in the world who go thru exactly what you did. I hope that made some sense lol it is just a thought that helps me gets thru whatever troubles occur in my life in general. Oh yes in my comment above I mentioned not being able to remember what article I was reading about That led me to finding out about selective mutism but no you just reminded me that is exactly what it was too for me When I was 7 I was diagnosed with SM but I never really know anything about it in till like was like 11 or 12 when I finally looked it up on YouTube and it was like woah I never know anyone else ever felt like I did. I mean still to this day I am still shocked that people understands how it feels. Lol I came across a book on Wattpad two or three years ago titled Selective Mutism and read it out of curiosity, as someone who struggled with talking it did not make sense why someone would \u201cselect\u201d to be mute. After reading it I realised I interpreted the name wrong and it was surprisingly similar to what I experienced and did a bit of research. A year or so later I found out I had a diagnosis for it since before I would read that book and just never knew (one of the teachers asked if I would write about selective mutism to help give a better understanding, since it was an online school that was meant to help, which I then asked my parents about).\nIt made so much more sense after learning about it and it was nice to know I was not the only one, its a shame I did not find out sooner.", "New to sub ... degrees of selective mutism? Hi all,\n\nLate DXed autistic woman here. I am wondering if I can in fact characterize myself as having selective mutism. \n\nIn most group social situations or even with most people one on one, my brain simply goes blank. People used to say to me, \"oh you must just be shy or afraid to talk...\" but that shoe never really fit. My brain simply does not produce anything that translates into spontaneous \"talk.\" \n\nI have NO problem conversing if it is relevant to one of my special interests. But a lot of NT conversation is popcorn style and random... and that is the cue for my brain to say, \"I am on my coffee break\" with regard to conversing. That kind of chatter just moves way too fast for me and tbh it does not interest me.\n\nDuring those \"blank brain\" times I can make really dull, robotic small talk, but I think it is clear to everyone that I am not really connected to anything I am saying. It really is just about \"not looking weird\" especially in work contexts. So I am not truly unable to speak at all during those blank brain times, but it is like I am coercing myself to do it from a script in many social situations. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Is it anxiety or just not knowing how to contribute? I have definitely sat silently at dinner with colleagues because they were talking about hockey and I... do not... watch it, or care about it, but otherwise have no problem conversing with these people and would not consider that selective mutism. \n\nI think most small talk is kind of scripted until both parties find a topic of mutual interest Idk if this is related but I have SM and one of my main things when it comes to wanting to speak is that I do not know what to speak about? Unless someone edges on the conversation, I will very rarely add my own direction to it.\n\nEdit: Also a big reason why I cannot speak too is because those people know I do not speak, so I have to beat that stigma/reaction via that stigma if I do speak. Which is why I will only speak in words at a time to those that know I do not speak and not in full sentences like I could to people who know nothing about me. Sounds like me and I have often wondered if I am on the spectrum. My father and one of my brothers is and my son is being tested so it would not surprise me if I was.\n\nIn my case I do not even respond I am often told I was not present or looked scared. I blank out a lot when I figure i would not even be able to contribute to a conversation or if I am overloaded by the sounds around me. I have the same problem and I do not consider myself to have SM although I can relate to a lot of the things on this sub Do you ever have it, where you do have something to say, but for the life of you, you cannot, or it is very difficult to (without altering your voice), say it? \n\nI do not think I necessarily have selective mutism, but when I was younger, some of my family suspected it. I never got tested. \n\nI got into the habit, where I was so used to not talking, that I started not even bothering to think of anything to say, sometimes, so then it caught me off-guard, when people actually expect me to say something. Sometimes I do not even answer simple questions, like \"what is your name?\", if I am very overwhelmed at the time. So, I do wonder if there are different degrees to selective mutism, or if I am 'just shy'. It is an interesting question. \n\nDoes it feel like you are choosing not to speak, or that you cannot (or it is difficult) even if you tried? Being nonverbal can be an aspect of autism on it is own, but as you likely know, SM and autism are often comorbid. The key feature of SM is that the mutism is caused by anxiety, so it will only be SM if the silence is due to anxiety, (this can present as not knowing what to say, but the cause is still anxiety, but if the ONLY reason for the mutism is not knowing what to say or being uninterested and you feel absolutely no anxiety around the situation then it is unlikely to be SM and rather just being nonverbal due to autism). Only you know the because' of the mutism, and us strangers on the internet will always know less than a licensed professional.", "Nothing gives me as much dread and anxiety as this thing.  OMFG \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d ", "selective Mutism: I Have No Mutism. But I Must SCREAM....  I would like to add to my post, based on a question from someone on r/aspergers....\n\nThe question was I describing \"stutter blocks\" and had I tried any techniques taught to reduce them.\n\n---\n\nThat is a great question. I had to pull my thoughts together\u2026 \n\nThat is a good thing.\n\nThe short answer? I do not know if what I am describing is related to stutter blocks. That is a new term to me. But I will look into it. And I will certainly take a look at the techniques. They may well help.\n\nThe longer answer\u2026 is, well, longer\u2026 Yet simple. \n\nI screwed up communicating. I most likely confused you by mixing too many things at once.\n\nIt is possible I have misled you through sloppy writing. I am not much more gifted at social media conversation than I am at verbal\u2026\n\nI emphasized the extremes in my post, without much context of what the general experience of selective mustism is about\u2026 \n\nI can see how that could muddy the waters. Being on the inside of experiences like these, without a view of what it looks like from your side\u2026 or being certain that I am explaining it clearly to someone who has not shared a similar experience\u2026\n\nReally screws with my head.\n\nSo, I guess what I am trying to do is to share my personal experience with three groups of folks. \n\n- If someone has similar experiences, I am hoping it will help validate their needs, just as others\u2019 experiences have helped me with mine.\n- If someone knows or loves someone with similar experiences, I thought they might gain from understanding what they are going through. I sometimes hear from folks that they find new ways to explain themselves from reading posts like these.\n- If someone is wondering, as so many are, if *they* are autistic\u2026 or are neurodiverse in some other way\u2026 I am pretty sure they will find value in experiential writing one way or t\u2019other.\n\nIt seemed to me that giving the most clear-cut, significant, and to some extent frightening examples of what my real life is like was a good way to go. \n\nI think I should be more careful to give general context in the future\u2026\n\nSo, here is the deal. \n\nSelective Mutism means to become involuntarily nonspeaking, or to significantly reduce speaking, around specific individuals or categories of people, in specific situations, under specific stress (such as social, performance, sensory), or under significant general stress. \n\nr/SelectiveMutism has some good stuff. And the Wikipedia article is not bad.\n\n*To my knowledge,* selective mutism can be experienced in a range, from what feels like a \u201creluctance\u201d to speak, to \u201cdifficulty\u201d speaking, to silence, to more neurological, or perhaps \u201chysterical\u201d symptoms in which I feel as if I loose coordination or control of my mouth, particularly jaw. This last is rare for me, I believe fewer than a dozen times in my life\u2026 when I felt what I perceived to be life-threatening levels of stress.\n\nAt one time professionals called the phenomenon \u201celective mutism,\u201d cuz they thought it was voluntary. \n\nIt is not. \n\nAlthough, I will say after decades of experiences like these, I have a sense that at the earliest onset, it feels inside like a \u201creluctance\u201d to speak, as if it is becoming too much effort. As if I do have some choice in the matter. But if I ignore that first warning, I am likely to end up mute.\n\nSome more everyday experiences of selective mutism:\n\n- Being in a business meeting with a hostile competitor, and being unable to contribute to discussion\u2026 despite the expertise, obligation, and *desire* to do so.\n- Being called on in class by a domineering teacher.\n- After being isolated from human contact for a day or two.\n- Being stunned into silence by harsh or demanding comment.\n- When overstimulated by numerous sensory or emotional inputs.\n- Sometimes when in pain or ill.\n\nWhile these are common situations that most humans face, and many may become shy, the difference is that selective mutism is involuntary and *tends toward* complete inability to speak.\n\nIn some situations, folks who are not aware of selective mutism\u2026. whether they are aware of neurodiversity or not\u2026 may misunderstand the intent of nonspeakers.\n\n- I have experienced selective mutism with a number of psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists for a variety of reasons. Several interpreted my silence as intentional and labeled it as \u201cresistance,\u201d \u201cpassive aggression,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d or other conscious or unconscious processes aimed toward them. I do not think so.\n- Similarly with doctors, dentists, lawyers, business partners\u2026. Just different names for it.\n- Some educators, from elementary to grad schools, have had difficulty with my mutism. Particularly because, in most contexts, I speak too much and too often as a general rule.\n- A close friend or loved one may assume I am angry, grumpy, distant, having an affair, hiding something, \u201cplaying mind games,\u201d\u2026 you get the idea. Let us just say, if I have such motivations for my unexplained silence, I remain the last to know. It seems an instinctual reaction to some form of overwhelm.\n- Law enforcement officers have interpreted my difficulty speaking a number of ways.\n- Fellow poker players ditto. (The few times I have played cards outside of childhood. I cannot win anything that involves masking emotion\u2026.)\n- Random, unexpected interchanges in daily life can stun me into silence, or greater than average difficulty speaking, such as a rude store clerk\u2026\n\nAs perhaps you can see, a lot of the details I wrote about in my post above therefore ARE NOT necessarily symptoms of selective mutism.\n\n- Stammering, stuttering, panic, embarrassment, brain freezes, \u201cwhite outs,\u201d\u2026 These are not, *to my knowledge,* symptoms of selective mutism, itself. They are my panicked attempts to fight the process\u2026 or the emotional fallout from having the experience in public. And perhaps also learned responses\u2026\n- *To my knowledge,* selective mutism is not about losing consciousness or awareness. I imagine that the panic I feel, to be unable to communicate, as well as the pubic embarrassment induce panic attacks severe enough to bring on a number of weird symptoms.\n- *I do not know* what other selective mutes or nonspeakers experience inside, but *I* *feel* as if I am losing my language *ability,* not just losing coordination with my mouth and voice box. I feel as if words slow down, come with difficulty, and can cease entirely\u2026 like a tip-of-the-tongue experience on steroids. I believe I switch from the language of internal monologue to experiencing a sequence of emotions, images, bodily feelings and understanding\u2026 and have a sense of *knowing\u2026* but I am not aware of thoughts as an internal monologue. I *tend to think* this is part of the experience of selective mutism, but have not read anything along those lines. Yet.\n\nThanks for making me think. It helps me clarify things for myself.", "The freeze response also happens to me in the online world Since I am unable to interact with people in person due to my severe anxiety and sm, I spend my time chatting and gaming online. For some weird reason the freeze response also happens to me in the online world. My mind sometimes blanks out when I am texting with my internet friends and every now and then it takes over twenty minutes (or longer) for me to write a simple text message back to people. Because I lose my words or simply get too anxious to respond. Which is really embarassing and anxiety inducing. \n\nDuring some other times when a friend invites me to play a new game with them I get super anxious and I freeze mid-game behind the screen and am unable to continue with what I was doing or to follow my friends' instructions. I think it is some sort of performance anxiety thing. Can anyone relate?", "do you have the same issues as me? Hey , I just found this subreddit when i was looking at what was causing me to not speak, even to my dad on the phone. Since there are a lot of anxiety orders, I am trying to narrow it down. Do you guys ever say something, then someone asks you to repeat it and you cannot? Like you just said it but if someone asks you again you just totally freeze up? Also something I find funny is when I am on the phone, i will mute myself and say \u2018hello\u2019 but when i unmute myself, i literally cannot say it? Lastly, I can say things under my breath perfectly, but if i try to project it feels like i will stutter or stumble on my words? \"Do you guys ever say something, and someone asks you to repeat it and you cant?\"\n\nAssuming by this you mean someone asks you cause they could not hear you the first time, then yeah this and everything else you said is relateable. \n\nIf u were to ask me id say u have SM, but ofc getchu a diagnosis from a therapist thanks homie, glad someone else is experiencing what i am. makes me feel less weird :) You are defo not alone! Only sad thing is we (SM ppl) wont find each other cause we will not be able to speak to each other, good thing this sub exists.", "Selective Mutism caused by PTSD? It is possible that selective mutism is caused by PTSD, right? I have been researching a bit and what I found says that someone can have selective mutism as a symptom of PTSD. Anyway, I would like to clear some doubts about this, more specifically about my case, and any answer is welcome.\n\nBriefly: I suspect I have selective mutism, or maybe I have. It started at age 10 and continues today, at 16. I mean, possibly. For the last year and a half there have been no face-to-face classes because of the pandemic, so I do not know if I can speak now (I do not speak in online classes either). What I mean is that at age 10 (before this period I went through some traumatic experiences, and I have reason to believe that I may have developed PTSD) I stopped talking at school like I said. And only at school. My god, before that, I was extremely outgoing. The kind that was friends with everyone in the room. But at that time I literally did not speak to anyone. And something that makes me a little \"confused\" when writing this is that I cannot say with certainty that it is selective mutism. Yes, I really think it is. But during that time I was just a kid, and my life was pretty stressful at that point. What I mean is that I never paid attention to the fact that I did not say anything. I thought it was normal. Not normal, but you know, I never really stopped to think about it like I am doing now. Also, luckily, even dumb, all my colleagues and teachers were always understanding (as far as possible). so I have never been in an embarrassing situation for not being able to answer a question or something like that, as many report here. That is why I say no that I do not remember very well what it felt like to try to speak or be questioned. So, it turns out that towards the end of last year, I decided to do some research on the internet about it, not specifically, and I ended up coming across social phobia (which I also strongly suspect I have) and from then on I started looking for more information. mental disorders and see if maybe one fit me. I got to see about selective mutism a while later, but it was a bit of a quick read and I ended up discarding it because I thought only younger children developed it, which apparently is not true. And that is basically it.\n\nWhat I would like to ask is: do you think that. given my situation (assuming it is selective mutism or not) would I be able to speak at school next year? And if it is not selective mutism, what could it be? Also, as I asked at the beginning, but can selective mutism be a symptom of PTSD? And if so, is the treatment the same as for \"traditional\" mutism? \n\nI am using Google Translate, so I apologize for any typos. Thank you for listening. My therapist said mine was caused by traumatic events in childhood/witnessing trauma being inflicted on other people. \n\nI have not talked since i was 6. At home i am VERY extroverted though, i talk too much lol. Its frustrating that i cannot balance it. \n\n\nI am 18 btw. I have not started treatment yet, I recently joined this group. If it was caused by trauma then it is traumatic mutism not SM.", "Impossible to write *important things* when I have anxiety You cannot talk, then write it up, they say \n\nIt is easy they say.\n\nHave a doctorappointment tomorrow. Without treatment I do not have a life. And I cannot for the love of good write the stupid list of what to say. \n\nAnd I have already written it on my pc. I just cannot bring myself to write it down on paper. I cannot think straight when I have anxiety. I do not trust my mind. I know what you mean, it is like my unconscious mind is deliberately ignoring the important thing that needs doing and my conscious mind is not strong enough to break through Could you take a picture of the list with your phone? I have experience with having the words in my mind, but being unable to write them or speak them. Those words needed expressing, but my mind saw expressing them as a threat. Even when the text is written, it can be hard to speak it or hear someone else read it, even showing the text to others can be very challenging and take many tries. Breathe.\n\nYou have them written on your computer, that is good, it is step 1 done. There are a few things you can try for step 2. You can make the text into a pdf (or copy and paste it) and send it to your email. That way you can access it on any device with an internet connection. Another option is to take a picture with your phone. That way you need to have your phone on you and charged so you can get to the list. Third option is to write it down on paper like you have been doing so far. That has proven to be challenging for you, but you might be able to get that working with grounding techniques that work for you. Step 3 is going into the appointment and reading the list or showing the list to the doctor. You know how you have done it before, you can do it again. If that method fails, and it probably will not, breathe and try again, or try a different method. You can get through it. People say to write it down just because it is what works for them. Really, communicate however you can find to communicate. Whatever way is easiest for you. Also, if you have your phone with, you do not need to write it down on paper. Use a tool like google keep where you can sync lists between your computer and phone, where you can copy and paste, etc. Just refer to that while at the appointment, if that works for you :) I like to used google docs and sheets so I can pull them up at appointments on my phone and just point when needed. I have the same issue. Luckily my dad is very supportive and we discuss things before hand (often in small portions over multiple days) and he gets to come with me to different appointments, there he speaks for me and I usually only have to nod in agreement. I am very lucky to have someone close to me, helping me with this. I know how difficult it is to find someone to trust with this type of sensitive topics but I really recommend it &gt;wish I had a person I could talk to like that  \\*hugs if you want one\\* \n\nI understand that, anxiety causes one to freeze on important things. Its why I cannot write stories when I feel anxious or have serious talks.", "Okay so quick question. I have not done much research on Selective mutism because when it did it upset me thinking about if I have it or not, so for a while now sometimes I cannot speak ? And my mouth kind of feels stuck and when I open my mouth nothing comes out. When I was younger and still now I stutter and mispronounce words :/ when I was younger I got picked on for it so I just stopped talking.\n\nToday at school I was not able to talk again and my friend wanted us to walk home and I just nodded and followed , she kept talking to me but I never responded just looked at her - she then got upset I was not talking and left me alone to walk home and I did , once I got home I had went into my moms room just so she can see I was home - but when I went in my mouth felt softer?

I am nauseous still thinking about about it, and the idea of actually speaking to him in person gets me bordering on panic.

First of all, I would like to say that if you are looking forward into seeing one, do it, it may help you a lot, but this post is to show if all of the experiences with a mental health professional are good.\n\n  Recently, I have made a comment ( saying: \" It is so frustrating when you go to a mental health professional because you cannot talk and they force you to talk about why you cannot talk\" and it had about 15 upvotes, which is a lot (I guess). Basically, I said that because I have already gone into 5 different professionals and I got a feeling that each one was worse than the other, it is not just that they did not help me, but after each session ended I got the feeling that I would never be able to talk normally.\n\n  Recently, I am thinking in going to another one, she is a neurologist and I think she would be better than the others, because in my class there are two boys with autism and she is their doctor and since autistic people usually have problems in communicating, I think she might help me. I had gone in for a check-up with my doctor one day and i tried to tell her ive had trouble speaking. I was only able to get out \"sometimes i cannot talk\" and she looked kind of angry then said everyone does that. She just continued on without listening to another word i said. Next time I am going to try to talk directly with a therapist and hope they listen to me. The thing is though, ive had a therapist before, but i could not talk to her and got nowhere. It is so sad when you go to therapy and you make so much effort and can talk something that for you is a world and they just ignore and keep saying that you need to be stronger and make more effort. If only all those people were more aware not just of the existing disorders, but of how the patients suffer as well. I hope the next time the therapist hears you and help you. Thank you, i hope you are able to find good help too! I was sent to a mental hospital once because school was too stressful to attend. Everybody thought I was just being stubborn and said they could not help me unless I talked to them. Some of them even laughed at me when I told them I could not. And when I had panic attacks they threatened to commit me as an inpatient unless I moved immediately. I am sorry for you. I hope you get better and find more respectful and nice people in your life. Yeah, that was before my parents understood what it really meant. Luckily they understand now and regret sending me there and everything\u2019s good now :) When I was in a really bad place about a year after I started seeing my therapist, I would immediately panic and freeze in my sessions, could not talk and cried the entire time. I remember my therapist saying \"I cannot help you if you do not talk to me\" towards the end after she had tried other things and I never went back. It made me feel like she gave up and I completely panicked. I did not know why until I started reading about SM. I did not know this was a \"thing\", I just have always done it involuntarily.   Same with me. When I discovered Selective Mutism, I felt so related and somehow even good because I thought that there were other people that suffered the same as I do, being unable to talk in a lot of places, but being normal and even loud in my house, and also feeling something, a horrible feeling (anxiety), when I know someone will say something to me and I will need to reply. I feel like we just went to seek for help with the wrong people, people that are too unexpert on this area of Anxiety, because of the lack of awareness on SM. Thanks for sharing a part of your story and I hope you get better. The problem is that doctors are always in a rush. \nThey do not have time to \u201ctalk\u201d to someone who does not talk. Yeah.

If you struggle to call a gp (which I suppose is some kind of doctor - sorry, I have never heard of it before), I do not see a problem in asking a family member to help you do so, since you may have some kind of communication issue, likely SM as you said.

There is usually a group video call where you do not have to speak or even turn on your camera you can just listen and it allows people to vent with their peers. If you are interested I can send you the link in a message. The group is only open to older people suffering from SM because a lot of groups are filled with parents or teachers asking questions and we really felt like we needed or own space so we could be heard. i am from the US..i am 25 and also do not really have any friends. \n\nfor ways to connect with people..not sure what things are like where you are due to covid but i would think just going out and doing things could be helpful for meeting other people..maybe some kind of class or activity that you attend at least once a week. \n\nfor about a year (until the pandemic hit) i would gone to a fitness class several times a week and slowly over time i was able to begin speaking to people..i would not say i made friends..but i was able to engage in little conversations (only if initiated by someone else) and even help a few people with the workouts. \n\nas for therapy..i am not really sure what to say on that. personally i see a therapist..i do have some other things going on aside from selective mutism..but i have been making progress. it is quite tedious though. \n\nso..i think it cannot hurt to look into therapy.

(on a notepad most likely) is it technically a lie to say no as i can to certain people, i dont want to say yes because it will raise questions which is a weird fear of mine to be questioned on my inability to talk, and it would also be a lie because i cant in most situations. this might sound like a weird one to ask but it really bothers me because i know it will happen one day and i wont know what to tell them", "I work at an over-night summer camp and need help knowing how to do the right thing So I am a camp counselor in training (I help our group\u2019s camp counselor) with a group of 3-4 year olds. So obviously this is our first summer opening since Covid. With that math, these kids have literally been quarantined at home for almost half their lives.\n\n\nThis year, we have a 4 year old boy \u201cBen\u201d who is selectively mute. He only talks at home. He is the sweetest, smart, and creative. I have background educationally about selective mutism and other anxiety disorders. However, I do not have background in practice. I have learned very quickly because our first priority is safety and making sure that he feels comfortable, and making sure that no one picks on him because he would not be able to tell anyone if that was happening.\n\nIt is been going well so far, and he is actually thriving. He has taken a huge liking to me, and has become my shadow in camp. I think it is because I remind him that I am there to help keep him safe, and taking the time to sit with him if I sense something is \u201coff\u201d. We ask him yes/no questions that he can nod his answer, and he can point when given choices.\n\nIs there anything else that I could be doing? He is here all day, and all night. We are 1.5 months in and it breaks my heart that even though he seems happy with me and I am very glad he has someone he can go to, it is all just a guess. I do not know what he is thinking really, and I am wondering if there is something I could be doing something better? Prior to dropping him off, mom and dad told me that he would start talking after getting comfortable with someone. So I am worried he is uncomfortable about something Go to the  Kurtz Psychology page and look up how to do VDI and CDI.  Basically at first you want to create a language rich environment where they child is not expected to speak. Then when the child communicates you step up the demands when they are ready.  The two components I beat remember is sportscasting.  That is were you narrate what they are doing \u201cI see your playing with blocks.\u201d You also want to give specific praise.  So when he nods yes \u201cthank you for letting me know that you want the..,\u201d Amazing thank you!\nI have basically been doing this already which is great to know I am on the right track. I will keep reading and researching! Sounds like you have been doing everything you can. You are supportive and give options for being nonverbal. If he feels comfortable enough to talk to you DO NOT REACT act like he is been talking the whole time. But also do not take it personally if he does not talk to you. When growing up with SM there were only a hand full of people I talked to, it was just a vibe I got from the people that felt like they were safe. I knew everyone else was still safe but I felt different about them. Thank you so much for reaching out to help him too. Omg I am so glad you said not to react. I had not even thought that far ahead about what to do if he DID. Ok so play it cool, and just respond, amazing, I can do that. I am also finding as much educational material as I can for the other counselors. I do not have background in camp or anything, but my background is in Psychology (years of in field practice) but none with SM. Though I am technically a counselor in training, they brought me on as a resource for children with varying needs, so I am trying to educate others on differing anxiety disorders, depression in children, and early signs of developmental delays. So though I know things about SM in \u2018theory,\u2019 it is my first time in person, and I did not want to f it up (plus it helps hearing from a first-hand community about experiences, rather than just statistics and scientific research. It is a personal experience that I want to customize and get as many opinions and perspectives on) I think you are doing a great job so far. Keep it up. I believe I would have gotten over my SM way earlier but when I DID try to talk people reacted so severely. \"OMG HE TALKED!\" and things of that nature.  I believe it is related to getting outcast/feeling abnormal but that is me personally. I cannot talk for this kid. You are doing fine. Your job is not to fix him, it is to give him a good summer camp experience. You are not Annie Sullivan and he is not a stray cat. Just treat him like any other kid.\n\nIf anything, showing too much favoritism to him would be too much for him, not to mention unfair to the other kids. Thank you! I am not trying to fix him.

I have tried to sit them down and tell them this, but they are way past convincing, so i figured if I am literally unable to talk then they will not care as much, so is there any way to give myself selective mutism? Bad solution, do not Eyo wtf \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28 Can we trade lives? I would fricken to get rid of my selective mutism and you could endure my everyday suffering instead. Okay that does not answer my question at all really Okay that does not really answer my question Hey, so that is kind of what I did (well not really, feels like it but I know that was not as much of a choice as I can believe sometimes) and I basically cannot talk around family now. My mother is abusive so it was a weird mix of \"I am unable to talk during a panic attack caused by her\" to \"I am unable to talk for days/weeks after a panic attack caused by her\" and then when I got my voice back after a month I did not even try to talk to her anymore, and it extended to my father because of trauma.\n\nAnd she just thinks I am faking being mute and that I could speak just fine even though I messaged her many times that I cannot. She gets annoyed all the time about me having to write and she is *bad* at understanding non verbal language (such as pointing two things to ask something related to both)I feel better not talking to her now and most people except family understand that I simply cannot. But the only thing that helped is because it limited my interactions with someone abusive to me by a lot, not talking did nothing in itself.\n\n\nIf they cannot even understand and repect that you do not like conversing, they will not accept you as mute and think you cannot talk especially if you could before. They will probably just be like \"stop being rude and ignoring us\" or think you are faking being mute. And non verbal communication can be really taxing with people like that who thinks you are just being annoying. \n\nI really do not think being mute is the solution in your case You can just stop speaking to them or not answering them if the topics bother you. It is normal that you want to avoid topics which are just annoying. \n\nBut it will not be SM since that is not a choice. Just from the sound of your post, pretending to be mute or \"giving yourself SM\" will not really help a lot if they are really way past convincing like you said.\n\nI had many arguments were I was not able to speak or even if I could speak there was nothing to say that would have convinced them. \nThe result is just even more frustration on both sides since you give them a feeling of shutting them out, ignoring and being rude for real with literally not interacting with them and not being able to solve that conflict. Then there is just avoiding or distancing yourself from a situation where both sides cannot seem to find compromises. \n\nMaybe try and talk to them and explain you just do not have a lot to add to conversations and pushing you to be more engaging like that just pressures you. \nAsking people how to get SM in a SM sub is kind of like asking people how to lose the ability to walk is a sub full of people with painful broken legs. \n\nSM is a severe anxiety disorder. Its unpleasant and often distressing. \n\nWhen I had SM I would have given ANYTHING to talk.\n\n People are cruel to you when you dont talk, even if they know you have SM. People think they can take advantage of you, people mock you and call you a coward. People with SM are assumed to be rude and 'purposefully ignoring people' all the time.\n\nYour parents would still try and make you talk, even with SM, youd just feel intense anxiety whilst they did it. hey from someone who is tried to make themselves permanently mute: do not. you will regret it. \"My boss keeps overworking me and when I tell him its too much he says 'it is not like you are dying'. Is there any way to give myself c a n c e r ????\" Selective Mutism has affected me for 18years and 9months, it is not something you want to endure willingly. If you committed to not speaking for long enough, eventually you may develop Selective Mutism, where talking is no longer a choice, but where you now are physically unable to talk.\n\nIt is not a good thing. Just tell them you do not have anything to add and if you do not have anything to add you just do not add anything, if they get angry that is their problem, you do not have to severe the ability to talk for this.\n\nThis is me looking out because Selective Mutism is not something anyone should go through.\n\nEdit: And I am not angry at you or thinking your insensitive, you probably do not know a ton about selective mutism, or if you do I would not expect you to realize what is it is actually like to live through it. In simple terms though, it sucks asshole.\n\nEdit2: I will give this analogy. Willingly giving yourself SM is keen to Suicide in a way, not as severe but to make it more understandable. SM is practically a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It is like jumping off a cliff that stretches for 10miles, how do you get back on land? Okay that does not answer my question It does, just without giving you the informations you asked for. In any case, I highly doubt anyone here will tell you how to have SM, as most never wanted it in the first place. we are trying to tell you that as much as you are hurting right now, you are only going to make things worse by trying to give yourself mutism. no one is going to tell you how to cause it is essentially the same as telling someone how to go deaf or go blind. why would we want that for anyone else yano? Okay well either answer my question or get out of my damn comment section Okay okay, weird concept\n\nYou do not come ask people in a sub with a condition that majorly debilitates their day-to-day life and ask how to develop it.\n\nNo one's going to help you do that, no one here would even know how. They do not \"choose\" to be or have SM. \n\nYour behaviour here is extremely insensitive, unsettling and immature Try to understand you are coming to THEIR subreddit. Please do not be rude. They did answer. It is very insensitive to ask people who genuinely have SM how to develop SM. Most of us have very very painful experiences with this disorder. You do not want this.", "in what situations are you mute? I have read many times that people with SM go mute when it is with people they do not know and in situations that make them anxious. \n\nIn what other situations do you go mute? \n\nDespite the situations where i physically cannot speak, I find myself wanting to go mute after an exhausting day of communicating verbally with people i am usually okay with communicating with.\n\nI do not feel anxious around them I just find I have the urge to stop talking.

They then expect me to talk when i am in other situations but do not realise that I need help and would like them to talk for me.\n\nI wish I could just tell them \u2018hey can we have some quiet time and not talk for a bit\u2019.\n\nDo any of you experience this? \n\nI am unsure of whether what I have is SM but I would like to gain insight so I can bring it up to my doctor.", "How to help my brother who had selective mutism? I do not have selective mutism but my little brother does. He is 15 now and he is been refraining to speak to most people this since he was around 8 or 9.\n\nI want to help him but I have no clue how. I cannot afford to take him to therapy and he would refuse anyway. What smaller things can I do to help him? Invite him to some hangouts you know he will enjoy? My sister did this in an attempt to make me more sociable (and still does it). The ones I have gone on are bowling, ice skating, six flags, and camping, things I have always wanted to do and was actually willing to risk meeting strangers for (her friends went too. Usually like 3-4 of them). Only do this if your friends do not mind, of course. Over time, it is helped me see that people are not as scary as I thought. Yeah my cats helped me become more comfortable to be around others and not be as awkward....but besides that, going out to a lot of places just having stuff to do helps the mindstate a bit. I went back to isolation for August, and it was killer to my progress....now I do not want to progress, although I do...but I also want to eventual fucking kill myself, so. I am not turning 20 with this shit, no matter what. Though that thinking will change, I would not doubt it.\n\nBefore I isolated myself, June/July my family and I started just going a lot of places together, for no particular reason, but we did. And the end of June is when this girl comes to our car (or my car, on that night)...and she is trying to talk to me about the car and how she had the same one, I never talked back....but we go to her house and she gives us parts for my car, she had from her's.....of course now I am fucking always thinking about this, because she was pretty as shit, and it is not even that, but then she is into the same shit I am into.....but of course I cannot socialize at all....my Mom got her number, but that was more than 2 months ago....so that was the motivation I had, and the motivation is by far the greatest path to change, at least so far in my life.....\n\nBut it feels now that it is been so long, it feels hopeless...and even if I do change, what is there for me? It sucks asshole, because as far as it is now, my life and my future is already known because nothing has changed, and unless it does, my life will not.\n\nI will always be dependent and hating it....I am jsut waiting on a new Laptop to come which has a VERY nice display, and I really got it because I just want to do some art in photoshop, idk why? That is how I am, I am very in the moment with what I want, even if it is stupid.....I do not care about a lot of the stupid shit everyone else does in life, so little is that important to me...it annoys me how annoyed people get at meaningless shit.\n\nI do not have a lot to talk about, and there is not a lot I want to talk about....so even if I started talking, I would be the fakest mother fucker there ever was. I have nothing I want to discuss.....I feel like I can but the motivation just is not there, and being fake, that is what It would feel like.\n\nIn the past I would not have spoken like this, but as I care less and less I just care less, I guess. I really am only focused on myself, as far as my life goes. I do not care about others too much, and it is hard for me to truly believe anyone loves me, I feel like I am just that weird ass part of the family....although I want to believe my family loves me, it is just hard to. Anyway I got to log onto my college class that starts in a minute, bye. And school too, does not mean much to me....more than the potential of what it could mean for me...I think living life is more important.   Honestly idk, I am 21 now with SM and I am still struggling I hope things get better for you :(\n\nCan I ask some questions to learn more about SM? First of all, thank you so much for sharing with me your life experience and those parts of you that probably affected you a lot.\n\nI am sorry you go through this. I am sure many people said it before me and many will after, but I truly mean it. I have seen my bro and I know how hard it is. I carry the hope that both you and him will one day get better, be able to be completely happy and live a life with motivation. The problem is my brother is really stubborn, and he is an indoors guy too. I tried to take him with me but he never wants to, even if the people going out are people he is comfortable with. And when he does not want, it is impossible to change his mind. Are there any indoors activities that help you? Idk tbh. I said no to a lot of things. I generally only said yes to activities that I absolutely did not want to miss out on. The camping was much more recent than the others btw (after I would already gotten a lot better). I used to only attend the things that I knew would be fun even without communication. Do you have hangouts that are game based maybe? Like going to the arcade or playing a sport or something? Maybe he would be interested in something like this This sounds interesting. We do not have arcades in our country (3rd world lol) but I will think of similar ideas. Thanks for the input! Sure Get your mom to talk to his school to get the counsellor/psychologist involved. She did talk to the school counselor, and the counselor told her that my bro is very isolated. He speaks to no one at school, he does not participate in class. And when the counselor talked in person to my brother, he told her \"he saw no reason to smile and to live\"... I think my brother is depressed, I recognize in him my own symptoms. He also occasionally self harms when he breaks down, but it is quite rare. I do not know how to begin helping him... Thank you! Please do not feel pressured to answer any questions you do not want to answer.\n\n1 - Is there a reason you became unable to speak, like a trauma ? Or did it just happen one day?\n\n2 - What it is like, in everyday life to have SM?\n\n3 - What do you feel when you have to talk to someone? Is it impossible for you to do, or is it more like extremely difficult?\n\n4 - What are the most annoying things you are told as someone with SM? 1- I was diagnosed around 6, but mom says I was like that since the beginning almost like I was born that way, I cannot remember ever bot having it and there was absolutely no trauma or apparent cause as to why I am just like this\n\n2- it is tough, anyone that I am not comfortable with I cannot talk to witch makes every task more difficult\n\n3- it is completely impossible, I get voice box paralysis and my throat constricts, no matter how hard I try to make any sound I cannot get anything out it simply does not happen\n\n4- \"I know you can talk, I see you talking to your friends just fine so just talk to me\" \ud83d\ude12\nIt is very annoying I feel so ashamed. When I was around 14 I used to shame my brother for not talking to our aunts, not realizing he literally could not do it... I was horrible and unfair to him.\n\nI am sorry you get experiences like that from ignorants  like younger me who know nothing about the disorder.\n\nCan I ask another question? You do not communicate verbally, but could you communicate in other ways like sign language? Are you just unable to speak or are you completely unable to interact with people?\n\nMy brother not only does not speak, but also does not make eye contact, does not smile and refuses to answer questions like \"do you want to have soda?\" or \"want another serving?\" with a nod or shaking his head most of the times. He also does not like when people try to interact with him and leaves if possible. Expectation triggers it, getting asked a direct question no matter how small or meaningless can just shut us down, I cannot look anyone in the eye at all outside people I am close to, and that makes it worse because people think you are being rude by ignoring them because your not looking at them or responding to them, with teachers that always made them mad, I was \"intentionally disrespecting them\" when really I was just panicking wishing they would let it go and not draw more attention to me, the last thing we want is everyone in a room looking at us making everything more uncomfortable, I cannot speak for everyone with SM but that is my Understanding, I also cannot talk over phonecalls or even the simple act of writing something on paper and showing it to someone makes me extremely nervous and uncomfortable, I do not know any sign language but I would be willing to try it in the future &gt;He also occasionally self harms when he breaks down, but it is quite rare. I do not know how to begin helping him...\n\nGo straight to your principal and tell them he needs mental health support and therapy NOW. I do not know where you are but some states would give him an IEP. And if they do not give him support, find another school and/or get him counseling outside of school asap. Thank you for all those informations they help a lot! If it is, let us say, a family dinner and someone wants to ask you if you want to drink soda, what would be the ideal circumstances and way for the person to ask the question? We live in a third world country which does not do much for children with mental health issues. I myself started seeing a psychiatrist because I was suicidal and depressed. My mother takes me there and pays for it and for my medication. I am a bit scared of telling her her other son might need the same thing... She took him to a psychologist once but it did not help. Oh, I am so sorry to hear it. Please do not be scared. You owe it to yourself and your sibling to tell your mom though. One time with a psychologist is not going to be enough. It takes time to establish a rapport and deal with these things. Off the top of my head I am not sure, at my house we are told to grab our drinks before we sit down so we just get what we want ahead of time without having to talk, sorry I cannot be more help with That, and before when you said he would not go to therapy I get that, it took me till I was 21 to actually agree to start therapy, I am fresh into it so I cannot say if it helps Yet, my mom goes with me and she has to talk for me at the moment but I am working on it :)", "Yeah.  ", "Child with S.M. suffers of severe night tantrums. Please share your similar story  My 4 year old doesnt speak at all during preschool hours, but she plays and interacts well with others, just not with words. When she comes home, shes so stressed with not speaking and being 'heard' and understood at school, she lashes out at home because that is where she feels safe. We just started seeing a family therapist, so hopefully the Dr can help her learn better coping mechanisms when her anxiety runs high. It helps me when I show patience, listen to what she has to say and just be there to hug her and reassure her that i understand. Some nights are hard as I am not a saint and can be impatient, some nights are easier when I can slow things down. But it always ends in I love yous and hugs and kisses. I had a few of these as a kid, and regularly as an adult (although the adult version obviously presents somewhat differently).\n\nIt sounds mostly like night terrors to me. If you are totally convinced she is awake it is probably more like a panic attack, but night terrors especially in children typically have a surprising resemblance to awake behavior. If it is night terrors, she will probably grow out of it. Most kids do.\n\nIf it is a panic attack or similar...The thing about being upset by the slightest touch is super relatable to me. It probably means she is overstimulated by her environment. Sensory processing issues are a big issue with certain disorders. Two of the best known are autism and PTSD, both of which overlap heavily with selective mutism. They are not the only disorders that cause sensory issues, far from it, but it is a common enough thing that it is reason enough to talk to a professional about diagnosis or ruling them out.\n\nAssuming she is awake, probably the best things you can do in the meantime are grounding and deep breathing. This is no replacement for professional advice, but done properly it cannot really hurt either. You want to get her focused on gentle sensory input. It sounds like she is really overwhelmed, so it might be really difficult to find the right place to start. Touch is not it, but maybe quietly playing some of her favorite music? Or asking her to look at something that is her favorite color? The goal here is to communicate to her subconscious (which does not listen to words or logic) that she is safe by asking it to register things it associates with safety. As she gets better at it, one of the best grounding techniques for children is I, Spy, but it sounds like you will need to really get her attention first before she can focus that much.", "Do I have sm? I have gone to two therapist to get help. One of them was this super religious guy who kept making references to the bible. He said that I had sm and that it was most likely because of my low self esteem. I moved countries when I was 6 and he said that I the language barrier might have been the issue. The therapist I currently have tells me that I dont have sm and that it is just some sort of social anxiety. I myself think that I meet the criteria for sm but I am not so sure anymore. I dont talk at all at school and when I am out with my mom I keep my voice quite low. I enjoy having conversations but I cant really do that with my friends. I still cant believe that I have friends but I think it is because they approached me first. We text a lot and it is sad because I cant speak to them. \nNone of the therapists have really helped. I keep lying to them and saying that I am making progress. I am not improving in any way though. I never knew that something was different about me because being quiet has become a part of who I am. Just like how I thought everyone saw the whiteboard in the classroom blurry, but it turned out to be my bad eyesight. I dont remember much of my childhood so I dont know when this all started. \n(I am in high school btw) Kids in some classes are always curious about why I never talk and all I can do is smile and nod politely. I also want to know how severe selective mutism can be so please share some information with me. \n I forgot to ask about sm and trauma!!My last therapist said that one of the reasons for sm could also be trauma. Anybody have info on that??? Hey there :)\n\nIf I (20M) understand correctly, you would LOVE to talk to everybody freely, but you are not able to to that because of a kind of LOCK that stops you in relation to certain situation or certain people. If that is the case (and please correct me if I am wrong) I can totally realte to your situation. I am in college now, and I usually  talk to people in an overall normal way, but when I was a child my situation was just like that.\n\nNow look, I am not a  therapist (far from it), but there is a piece of advice that I would be happy to give you: I think you should find a therapist that truly understands what your going through. Many people may think that you do not talk to them because you are stubborn, or things like that (like some of my teachers thought of me by the way), but that may be just because they never had the opportunity to know what it is like to be on your side. Of course, for that to happen you shuold be honest with the therapist ;)\n\nLook I know this answer of mine is messy, and poorly informed, and it may appear less than polite in many aspects. Btw I realize now that I have not even answered your actual question. I apologize for all that. But, you know, I related to what you had written and felt bad about not saying anything as a reply...\n\nPlease take care, and write back whatever you want if you feel like it :) Thank you for responding!! Yeah I think its a very similar situation to yours :)  I want to talk with people but I sort of freeze up. Some teachers have forced me to speak and it made me super uncomfortable. Thank you for taking you time to write back\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43 Social anxiety in my eyes applies when a person is in a social situation. Selective mutism will apply even outside of a social situation i.e. just passive a group of people and not wanting them to hear you speak. \n\n\nI hope that clarifies things for you - my opinion coming from a father of a child with SM, me with social anxiety but still not an expert. Plenty sources state that many with SM show no sign of trauma but what no article ever talks about is the defination of trauma!\n\nThese people who get taught at University do not like breaking down the jargon any further than it was by their lecturers. Trauma for example is unmeasurable and an individuals limits are unmeasurable.\n\n\nWhat I am saying is that someones brain might be wired in a way that an common and averagely upsetting event causes a mental scar. They should never force a person with SM - that is a big problem that needs dealt with. All it will do is encourage you to find ways to avoid the situations that lead you to being forced.\n\n\nInclusion is a right without conditions. You have every right to an education without having to do everything that is asked - that might be easier with some medical grounds though. I do not think it is super important what you call it. Below in brackets is a post I made on another thread about Selective Mutism. Hope this helps!\n\n\n\n[[I have been in your position. I eventually overcame Selective Mutism and, looking back, I think I can offer some advice. What you have definitely sounds like selective mutism but what you label it is not super important. I had selective mutism for as long as I can remember. I only spoke to immediate family and no one else. I was very afraid of embarrassment, and if I was put in a situation where I was expected to speak I simply would not. Another aspect of it for me was if I started talking I did not want people to make a big deal out of it or tell me they were proud of me (I did not want to be the center of attention), so I just did not speak.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is Selective Mutism is not something you are stuck with forever. You can and absolutely will overcome it. When I was 13 I made the decision that I was not going to except the life of a selective mute. I decided to do whatever was necessary to crush SM. You are going to have to stare your fears right in the face and say \u201cI am bigger than you!\u201d\n\nIn my experience the only way I beat SM is through internal motivation. My parents, or anyone else, telling me to start talking failed to resonate with me (mostly because I am incredibly stubborn). But when I decided I was going to start talking it was my own choice.\n\nHere is what I would recommend to start with:\n\n1.\t\u2060Acknowledge to yourself that you want to speak freely, without fear, and you want it more than anything. You should become obsessed with wanting to talk to people. The quality of your life will be better if you open up to people and communicate. I cannot express how much you should crave this.\n2.\t\u2060Identify a step of action you can take this week. Whether it is talking to one of your teachers or for me it was muttering \u201cthank you\u201d to a worker at Shenanigans. After taking this step, all your future interactions will be a little easier.\n3.\t\u2060Continue taking little steps to gradually open up to people.\n\nImproving your social skills is a life long journey that never ends. Once you are more comfortable talking to people you will begin to make some good friends and in my case I actually enjoy chatting with people now. I do not regret that I had Selective Mutism because it made me very independent and emotionally self sufficient.\n\nRemember, you have a whole life ahead of you; you do not want to go through it as a mute. When you break through SM and start talking to people I promise you your life will be better and, you will be unstoppable at any task you set your mind to.\n\nI could go on about this forever but I will stop here. I would be happy to answer any specific questions you have.]]", "Can SM cause Avoidant Personality Disorder? Can Selective Mutism cause AvPD? I have been reading a bit on AvPD and a lot of my experiences are similar, and now I am really confused, because I am not sure what my problem is. I have both, and definitely feel they go hand in hand. I had selective mutism as a child (due to several sources of early childhood trauma). I never quite outgrew the discomfort of speaking up in class even though I made it through college. As an adult, I have strong anxious-avoidant and fearful-avoidant tendencies as well as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder &amp; panic disorder. Selective mutism didnt *cause* any of those things, all of them together are symptoms of unhealed trauma. I go to therapy several times per month to heal from my trauma (little t and big T traumas). \n\nHuman behavior is too complex to assign one label and any therapist/professional worth their degree(s) will tell you the same. It is probably possible. Most mental disorders co-occur within multiple others. I for one am far from avoidant, despite SM I still like to hang out and talk with people that which I talk to.\n\nAny rejection issue I attribute to Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, via ADHD.", "Is it wrong for me (15) to be online friends with 18-20 year olds? I have no friends in real life because of my selective mutism so I spend most of my time online. I still struggle talking to people online but it is easier than irl. Even with this being the worst year of my life I have kind of made some online \u201cfriends\u201d (I put it in quotation marks because they might just consider me an acquaintance). The thing is that they are older than me (I do not tell them my age). Is this bad? The only person I really hang out with irl is my 19 year old brother which is why I probably connect easier with them. People tend to think that I am older than I am. Are you me but a little bit younger?!\n\nHonestly, all of my online friends are older than me. The eldest is like 6 years older than me, youngest is 1 year older than me. \n\nI would not really say that I have SM anymore, over the last year or 2 it is just turned into moderate social anxiety with a horrible shyness... (but I am getting better all the time!). But I would say that my SM made me more mature. I observed things, I spent time online and in the library reading things... being quiet, having few friends, it really makes you grow up, at least when it comes to mental maturity, quicker.\n\nSo I am guessing that it is the same case for you. And that is why our online friends are older, we can connect to them a bit more than people our age ", "I am 30 y/o. I do not have any friends or family. I cannot afford to seek a professional. What can I do? Title basically covers it. I do not speak to anyone at work and I never really spoke to anyone in school. I recall my teachers bringing it up a few times with my parents when I was younger, but they are both shy, so I guess they just thought it was normal and never sought out a professional.\n\nMost of my communication is with nods and pointing.

I want to make a set of cards for our non-verbal or deaf customers at work so that I can better communicate with guests and be as accommodating as possible...what are some words or phrases I can add that you think would be helpful so that guests can communicate their needs with me better? That is very sweet and considerate of you. Not to get personal, but that depends on what you do for a living. There would be stark difference in cards if you worked as a sex worker vs an innkeeper. Know what I am sayin'? I do not know what you work as and the content on the cards would largely depend on that, but one phrase I think would be helpful regardless of what services you provide is something like \u201cthere is not a card for what I want to say.\u201d I doubt a card system would cover every possible thing a customer would want to say, so being able to easily communicate that there is not a card for what they want to say would let you know that they need something else to communicate with. I made a card that says \u201cI need a pen and paper\u201d so that they can write their specific questions down. hope that that will cover that area, I know that cards are not going to cover all circumstances so I will definitely card a notebook and some paper &lt;3 hahaha yeah that is 100% true!

I was talking to someone about my SM and I started to think about the endless hours when I am silent and if that is part of SM. I know that when I have a crisis and I cannot talk to strangers or at school, that is because of SM. But sometimes I do not have a big crisis or I am in a different place or I need to talk to someone, sometimes I am fine, in my room listening to music and then I just stop. I do not want to talk, I do not want to open my mouth to anything and sometimes I do not even want to chat through messages, I just want to be silent. And sometimes too, I need to go out, like going to the mall or the psychologist and I am silent from nowhere, it starts on the bus and lasts until someone forces me to speak. I just want to be silent, because I have no reason to speak, I see no sense in speaking. I have lost count of how many times I have thought about learning sign language just so I do not have to speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if those moments in silence, those three, four, five, six hours when I just keep quiet in my room are part of SM. It is an aspect of your personality, as are all the behaviours that constitute selective mutism. It is when it begins to impact your life negatively that it could be considered part of a disorder. You say that you seem capable of breaking your silence when necessary, so it does not really seem something to be worried over, unless by your own assessment it is causing you harm. And it may be, if it keeps you from establishing and growing relationships or doing the productive work you need to, whatever that may be. But some people simply prefer quietness and not speaking. If you are comfortable with this aspect of yourself and it is not preventing you from living life as you might wish it I do not see much of a problem For sure. Especially because after a while not talking becomes ingrained.

", "struggled with it for years i am someone who has felt alone with selective mutism. i feel like no one understands. so i wanted to share my story about how it ruined my life. people who can easily talk do not understand that you cannot just choose to talk, but you are physically incapable of speaking around certain people or situations. ever since i was young, i did not speak to my cousins, grandparents, dad, brother, strangers, etc. but it is weird because i felt comfortable around my other siblings and my mom. it was like i was a whole different person around them. my mom sent me to many counsellors to get me to talk more because she was worried about the fact i was still mute by the age of 10. when you are a little kid, it is cute and you are just called \u201cshy\u201d, but when you get older into your teens years, it is not so cute anymore. the first few times i went to a counselor, it was not very effective, and i refused to open up and talk to people. i wished i could speak but i felt like my voice was trapped inside someone who wanted to talk. i realized around the age of 11 that i needed to change. so my mom sent me back to counseling and i worked on various activities to open up a bit. i gradually started ordering my own food at restaurants, and i gradually spoke to different family members. i eventually started talking to everyone in my family. now at 15, i still do not speak to my dad because he is lost my trust. but this also means that i cannot talk to his side or the family, or to any strangers when i am with my dad. i feel really conflicted and like i am being rude when i just do not answer someone is question because i am physically unable to. when i get around large groups, i find it hard to add to conversations or even say anything. sometimes during school presentations, i think i am being loud enough, but everyone tells me to speak up. i think with selective mutism comes a bit of volume control issues. everyone tells me i talk really quiet when i think i am speaking loud. anyways, i just wanted to share this because it has really made it hard for me to live a normal life and be a normal kid. people at school make fun of me a lot for being quiet and it makes me really sad. and people think it is funny but they do not understand how hard it is to not talk. i know this is a really long post but i have felt alone throughout my journey with selective mutism and i do not want others to feel that way. i am sorry that sm is making your teenage life hell :( i can totally relate to being scolded to speak louder when presenting situation. i recovered when i was 11 (i am 18 now), but it left me with really bad social anxiety and my voice is always super quiet when i am around my coworkers, teachers and other classmates who are not my friends. when i think i am reasonably loud, being asked to repeat or being told i am too quiet makes me want to die lmao This is an excellent post and it is a very good thing that you were able to share this. I am sorry you have had to go through this, it is heartwrenching.

I am not being offensive when I am those situations but I do notice it is a common reaction sometimes from my encounters. I am wondering if this is something others who struggle with this have experienced. I do the same thing as well! I believe people respond this way when meeting new people as a way to have a \"barrier\" that will not leave them vulnerable to judgment and/or embarrassment. \nI have noticed that I have been responding this way towards people in general for so long that now I am trying to do everything I can to change it. Yeah, I have noticed being \u201cshy\u201d offends quite a lot of people. Probably because most people are impatient with those who struggle with social interaction... \ud83d\ude1e Yes I have noticed that people react that way even since I was very young. People label me as standoffish and unapproachable Yep, this has been a pretty big problem my whole life. People tend to view shyness or severe social anxiety as standoffish and rude, rather than what it actually is. Then they act rude because they think *you are* being rude. I have had a lot of people not like me because of it. It is really frustrating. Glad to know I am not alone :) Yes I have noticed that people tend to assume someone who is being quiet or introverted is uncomfortable, which is often true; they also tend to assume that if someone is uncomfortable around them that it is them personally that causes the discomfort, which of often not the case in people with anxiety disorders. But they assume that, and because there is nothing for them to attach the discomfort to they move to their own subjective insecurities as the reason. Whatever they feel insecure about will tend to be identified as the thing coming between a potential friendly relationship, rather than something going on unrelated to them It is such a tricky disorder because just forcing conversations for the sake of forcing conversations is no good either and can lead to awkwardness where people just want to escape the situation. Also it is not possible to explain what is happening as people are misinterpreting what is happening. I feel like people see me as not caring about being present and the truth is I am not present because I am trying to come across as being present more than actually being involved in the conversation American culture is not exactly supportive of 'shyness' or introversion. Not being able to be freely expressive or outgoing is a major setback in all aspects of life I feel like that is your mental state trying to make you less approachable so you can feel less anxious. Seeking a therapist or specialist will help, if not able just work on it yourself.  \nI am trying to not make a huge paragraph here so what I said may sound rude, that is not my intention I want to help.  \n\n\nFor example, write down a good or bad social interaction. State how you felt emotion wise (frustrated, scared, etc). then write down body symptoms, (nausea, shakey), finally, write what you were thinking in your mind (\"Do they hate me?\", \"Am I doing this wrong?\"   \n\n\nSoon you will find a common factor so you can realize if you are being a bit aggressive or rude by common symptoms and thoughts, etc. Later write what you should have said and how you should have said it so you can use it for the future.   \n\n\nI am **NOT** a therapist and I **DONT** specialize in psychology, I am using what I have learned through therapy and treatment to try to help you.

I am probably weird bc I cannot handle talking on the phone/through microphone - it is harder for me than talking in person. Do I drop the class? Do I just refuse to do that part and take a probably bad grade? lol\n\nYou can tell I am very avoidant because it just feels inconceivable to me to do it rn, like not even a consideration in my mind. \n\nI do not have any accommodations at the college because, of course, that tends to involve a meeting where, y'know...you are expected to talk. And I am diagnosed, but I was not sure if SM was considered a legit diagnosis into adulthood (is it still considered a childhood disorder in the DSM?). I cannot really answer any of your questions cuz I am wondering the same thing (lol) but do not feel weird about how it is worse talking over the phone/zoom, I feel the same. Maybe try contacting the school via email and make it clear that you suffer from this and ask how you can move forward, cannot promise it will work but it is worth a try I was/am struggling with the same problems. When I started this year I was extremely nervous about classes where I would have to speak, etc. I was lucky enough to have a great sister who helped me get set up with the disability services at my university where I have gotten continual support. Maybe you could have someone help you with getting accommodations by speaking for you? Since you have a diagnosis, you could try sending them an e-mail. Even if it is cosidered a childhood disorder (I have no idea if it is), it is likely that the college will not know it unless they are intimately familiar with the DSM xD\n\nPerhaps you can ask your psychiatrist/psychologist to give you some sort of official paper verifying you have SM and attach it to your mail so they know you are not aviding the class just because. \n\nPractical advice aside, I feel you bro xD I avoided going to a an oral exam for three years because I knew I could not say a word. Even my grades show exactly which exams were oral and which were written haha :D It is not an easy choice, but I would say take advantage of the pandemic while you still can. I had to take communications class through Zoom and it was awful, but I knew that it would be way harder to do it in person once college is open. Lucky my teacher only required us to only do one presition live, while the rest were recorded. Maybe go to ratemyprofessor.com to look at reviews and see if any teachers have a similar structure where you only need to record videos and not present them live.\n\nIf that does not work for you then I would suggest a more drastic measure. Try downloading OBS studio and setting up a virtual camera on your computer. This way you can stream pre-recorded videos and it will appear as if it is you live camera. However this is a little risky because you could get caught if the teacher asks a question, or if there are technical errors. You can switch between pre-recorded footage and your normal camera if that helps. Only use this method if you have no other choice tho. I am in the same boat as you. I have my PhD viva coming in a couple of weeks. Honestly, the last couple of times I went on stage to present my work, I could not literally get a word out of my mouth! I feel like zoom is a much better option than in-presentation.", "! TW - SELF HARM MENTION ! Unnecessary torment has made me an emotionally stronger person, and I haphazardly thank the tormentors.

Thanks for sharing!", "Can someone tell me if this maybe selective mutism I had an accident in 2013. I was in the hospital for almost month before I woke up fully (they kept me sedated because apparently I kept trying to pull my ventilator tube out). When they did take the tube out and tried asking me questions I would not speak to anyone including my family. I would write things down in a book to answer them. I could not handle having too many people around me, I would have major panic attacks.  They did diagnose me with anxiety in the hospital. It took time before I was comfortable to speak to anyone family included. \n\nWhenever I get in a mood( best way for me to describe it) I shutdown and will not talk. My boyfriend tries to get me to talk and I want to but it feels almost physically impossible for me talk. As he continues to try I try to talk little by little but it always really hard. I try to work my way out of mood which is also really hard but I realize that I cannot really have a conversation with anyone until I feel better. \n\nI do not know if this maybe selective mutism. Can someone let me know please. I am no doctor so please take this all with a grain of salt but can you talk effortlessly when you are on your own? If yes then that does seem like SM. Brain injuries can cause changes in personality but if the accident was particularly traumatizing for you then that is something that could be a factor in why you are more prone to anxiety. If you do still struggle to speak with no one around then it could be something like dysarthria. Thank you for the comment. \nMy injuries were internal abdominal injuries. When I am on my own and I am still feeling that way I still do not talk(some people say it is not good to talk to yourself but I do. I do not answer myself though lol). \nI realize that I shutdown on everyone. I do not like the feeling but I cannot help it. To me it does not sound like SM but more like PTSD resulting from what sounds like (to me)trauma you experienced in the hospital. Medical traumas are not always acknowledged but are as significant as any other type of trauma. \n\n if you still cannot talk even on your own then it does not sound like sm. I am also not a doctor, but I think that would be mutism which would probably be a symptom and not the cause. you should go see your doctor when you can just to be safe cause we are just some quiet internet people, and with potential brain problems you really want to err on the side of caution", "do you have the same problems? ", "Is this autism thing or selective mutism and how to deal with it? When I talk to myself or my parents I can talk perfectly fine. When I am passionate or when I am angry, I talk perfectly fine regardless of the situation.\n\nBut in other situations, I find it extremely hard to talk. The words do not come out from my mouth like it gets stuck. But I still can talk, but I always have to say \u201cMmm...\u201d before saying the first word although I am not even thinking. For the record, I am 13 right now and I have Aspergers and ADHD. This started around 2 years ago when I moved to the United States from another country. When I speak in my native language, I usually do not have any problem. Is this autism thing or selective mutism? Since it is situational instead of constant, I would think selective mutism. (sorry for the english)\n\nI would say both, because they are often really intertwined, but since it seems to be more dependant of a socio-situational event but you can still talk (even if you need a starting sentence) i would lean more towards \"autism thing\". Which is great, because you can learn (with time and patience) how to manage it and get more fluid with your voice.\n\nBest of luck ! Autistic traits can vary a lot by situation as well... If it is only in a second language, it might not be either, just the standard difficulty of expressing oneself in a different language (possibly + extra social awkwardness/anxiety from being Autistic) I have no problem with English now, when I speak to myself, I speak perfectly fine (I speak mostly English when talking to myself and my family) I just included that detail because I thought the change of the environment may be the cause. if it started with you still being able to talk then it doens't sound like SM. SM is the total inability to speak (it can develop into difficulty speaking during recovery, but if you have always still been able to speak then it isnt classed as SM). It could be 'classic' social anxiety, which can cause both difficulty speaking and can increase how often you say filler words such as um.\n\nAutism can be related to social anixrty, or social anxiety can develop seperate to autism.", "I used to have Selective Mutism when I was younger. What are some long-term effects I can expect to have? So I used to have selective mutism from around the age of 3-8. I would not talk at all to some people, but as I got older I would whisper more. I did some kid-oriented therapy but I cannot remember if that was very helpful or not. Around Grade 3 I think I was ready to speak out loud but I was worried that my classmates would ask too many questions if I suddenly started speaking so I transferred schools for a fresh start. That worked for me, and for a while I never really looked back to see how having Selective Mutism affected me. I honestly did not think it had much of an impact on me because I barely remember what it was like, and I cannot even remember feeling anxious (though my mom tells me I did). \n\nHowever, I have been reflecting on what things I still do because I used to have it. For instance, I have a bad habit of letting people talk for me, especially in uncomfortable social situations, like ordering food, or talking to family friends. I know I am a quieter person because of it, although my teachers loved me for that, so I am a little proud of my self regulation, even if it means I speak a bit more softly. I know that I am an anxious person (I refuse to self diagnose myself with anxiety) but I cannot tell if it is an abnormal amount of anxiety or the regular amount of stress. I am an overthinker and I hate making mistakes when I speak, whether it is phrasing, or stuttering, or hesitating to speak. So I think those are the things that I have picked up because I used to have Selective Mutism, but what other habits can I expect to have? I had SM from the ages of 3-13. I am 22 now. I feel the EXACT same way as you do in the situations you described. I also am an overthinker and I am really hard on myself if I stumble over my words.\nAs far as answering your question, I have no expertise to give a correct answer. However, I have some experiences with anxiety day to day that I can describe. (I agree with you about self diagnosing anxiety though. I had a severe anxiety disorder for 10 years and have come so far since then so I do not like to say I still have it). \n\n-I have trouble talking in groups even when I am 100% comfortable with everyone there. No problems with 1 on 1 unless they are really close to my face.\n\n-I struggle to do things for myself in similar ways you described such as ordering food, talking on the phone, etc. If I do have to, I sweat a lot lol. For some reason though, I have less trouble when it is for someone else. \n\n-I often notice myself observing rather than participating in social situations.\n\n-I am always very aware of the amount of space I take up in crowded areas. I hate being in the way or causing a disturbance.\n\n-I do not go through drive through ever unless someone else is with me.\n\n-I try to go as long as I can without having to go to the grocery store. I do not enjoy going by myself because I want to spend forever looking at things and I feel like I am in the way all the time. I always wear headphones if I am by myself because it makes me feel more secure.\n\n-I take a long time making decisions. \n\n-I still REFUSE to go through a cafeteria line. An effect it had on me is that I have less social anxiety than a lot of people, even if these people do not have social anxiety. Maybe it is my depression or something but I just do not care in a good way. Someone has told me I do not overthink, I just do and that is mostly true.\n\nI did a Psychology Today quiz on anxiety and I got a really low score and it said hm, you might be having too little anxiety in general.\n\nAn online quiz means little more than nothing. I still have trouble sleeping at night anda bit of ocd, i still have anxiety in there.\n\nBut selective mutism was really crippling as a kid and in my early teens. I still had social anxiety into my late teens. I do not know at one point in my late teens i kind of realized wow all that worrying all my life was a waste, I wasted time being worried. I avoided situations and did not get what I wanted. And that is how selective mutism affected me until today.\n\nDespite being \"loud\" now, like in the other comment and your post, I let people speak for me sometimes and I am still submissive in a way. At work if there is something going on that I do not like I will not say anything. Diagnosed at 4 and recovered at 7. But I do have prolonged moments of being quiet and not initiate mainly because I gained the habits of being too self-conscious and overthink. I guess I have to carry these unless I found some sort of solutions.\n\n-Social anxiety, of course.\n\n-Risk of personality disorder. Risk of narcissistic traits. Inter-relationship skills will be impaired if we continue to avoid interaction.\n\n-Difficulty in conversing when you are anxious.\n\nI believe there is a genetic or epigenetic predisposition to heightened anxiety, hence SM as some coping mechanism. Even with a nurturing environment and a strong family support. Both sides of my parents are very anxious people, so I am not surprised that I get passed on with anxiety-promoting traits. School can reinforce SM when peers and teachers discourage and bully for our silence instead of tolerance or outreach.\n\nWe mold our identities in response to traits and events. Especially in response to SM.

I feel kind of embarrased about that feeling, the silent treatment is the worst way to make up, betchyall asses you are all nodding at that. Obviously I am still involuntarily nonverbal and the confusion of others, even if not anxiety inducing, bothers me, but I am just blank, which bothers me even more and people try to make me talk (they do not know about my sm, but also they do not like as head on, why am i quiet) by keeping up the conversation.

I do not know N's cousin's age or name--only that we go to the same school. I will call N's cousin as C.\n\nI never talk at school. No one at school has heard my voice, except for a few rare times over the years when my voice slipped out or someone posted a video of me online. Only a few teachers know about my condition. I did a research project in my Psychology class on SM, but never directly told my classmates I had it, though I think many of them who know about it speculate.\n\nMany people do not try to talk to me. I always assumed it was because I often act like I do not care about anyone (I put on a facade of someone aloof so I do not have to go through the social embarrassment of using written communication). However, N told me earlier that C texted N. C said he felt bad always seeing me alone (keep in mind that although I was previously told what C's name was, and have met him once before when he was sitting in the backseat of my brother's car, I do not remember what he looks like or anything else about him), especially during passing period (which is the period of time we have to get to the next class) and lunch.\n\nN continued on to say that C and many others at school think I am mute. N and C do not know I have SM, so I am pretty sure he meant in the physical sense, and had no idea that he hit it right on the nail. I just laughed and gave a few excuses (I said I did not \"f\\*ck with anyone at that school--they are all drama-thirsty. I just want some peace and quiet.\"), but did not know whether I should address the real problem (that I actually have SM and act like a jerk so that I feel less bad about the fact that I am a social outcast at school).\n\nI know it is in the name, but can I consider SM as a legitimate form of mutism? It is a pretty stupid question, but the majority of people in my life constantly crack inconsiderate jokes about me not talking (even my friends and family, especially the ones who know about my condition). Because of that, I do not feel like I have a real reason to not talk.\n\nBut what do you think? Should I have said something like, \"Well, that is because I kind of AM mute\"???

Hopefully this feeling goes away soon and I do not regret it The fact that you were dreading going to work says it all really, it was clearly not the right environment for you to thrive. I hope you find a new job that suits you better soon. I am amazed that you pursued a job in customer service to begin with!  Exposure therapy played a huge part in my daughter's life with SM.  On the other hand, that job does not fit you.  Find you something that you love to do! I am sorry this happened. Working in a customer service position without a voice is very, *very* difficult. \n\nMy SM has been long-standing, but it only happened in social situations, I was fine at home and work for the most part. Now though, I also have physical medical conditions in addition to my psychological ones that make my speech incredibly difficult to hear and sustain, so I am almost always mute. Customers and coworkers cannot hear me. But since I was able to show that I had medical conditions that took my voice, my employer is working with me to make things better and to help me communicate. \n\nIt is awful, but I feel like if I told them I experience, or ever experienced SM, they would not have been so keen to help me. By the time you are seeking a new job, and you still experience SM, maybe you can try to let your next employer know you have a condition that makes talking difficult (or impossible). They may try to accommodate you, especially if you can get a therapist or other professional to sign off on it. For example, if you are able to write you can use a boogie board, or an aac device or app to communicate with people. Or you can try a nightly retail position where the chances of talking around large groups of strangers would be much smaller. I felt the same at my traineeship.

I even made a post about it a few months ago:  Story of my life", "Wish I had more friends :(  im slowly losing touch with my friends because im silent most of the time so i never really add anything, tis sad Same :( Same. I only have one friend and we have not seen each other since March of 2020 Yeah, but life is a roller coaster at one point we have lots of friends then at times we feel like we only have 1 or 2 but that does not mean they do not care about you. It is just that things are changing and it happens to everyone, we do not keep friends and I do not think it is bad, it is just a way of life telling you something better is to come! :) I was always 'maybe next year I will get better. Maybe next year. Maybe a couple years later,' then suddenly I was graduating college, now I have no one. Never made one. Be strong, my friend! I did not over come selective mutism until adulthood, when I randomly found some women in a church group whom I connected with. I know you are in a ton of pain, and that you are doing everything you can. Please just keep putting yourself in social situations; every one-word answer or two-sentence conversation is a triumph. If you have access to mental health care, my hope is that you will have the self-love to take advantage of those resources. Things can and will get better. Praying for you!  Same :/ Same. feel you ", "No therapists with SM experience near enough to help Why is it so hard to find a therapist who is even heard of SM? There is just no one anywhere near us with any experience in SM. We cannot afford to go to any of the major centers for treatment or any of those alternatives.\n\nI am frustrated trying to find reliable treatment for my son. He is 12, about to finish 6th grade, and he still does not talk at school or to many of our friends and family. I just want to help him, and my husband and I are stuck doing the best we can on our own right now.\n\nThankfully, all of his teachers and school staff have been amazingly understanding. He has one teacher who is a little pushy, but not too bad. He just says stuff like, \"you will talk to me by the end of the school year, right?\" And the other kids have all been great, too. They are all more likely to defend his not talking with new substitutes etc than to bug him about it. He is only had one bullying incident, from a girl who was acting out against everyone, and she has since actually become a friend of his.\n\nMy son is amazing, and he has continued to make baby steps of progress, like interacting more with people he does not talk to or not whispering so quietly to us when anyone else is in the same room. But I want to get him all the help he needs to overcome this speech anxiety, and I am so frustrated at the lack of experience around here. He is so intelligent and well-spoken and everyone likes him... I wish he could just be himself all the time, without having to whisper or write everything he wants to say. I understand how frustrating it is to find someone who understands and is able to help. If you do not mind me asking, where are you located? West Texas\n\nI have looked up I think every therapist listed in a 200 mile radius... We are at the point of having to find someone with experience in children with anxiety who is willing to educate themselves on SM and treating it. Sadly, this is easier said than done. While it would be helpful, I do not think you necessarily need a therapist who is knowledgable about SM. I think finding a therapist who has a thorough understanding of OCD or other anxiety disorders and their treatment can potentially work just as well.\n\nI recovered from SM at a residential facility that mostly caters to people with OCD and my treatment (mostly CBT and exposure therapy) was never significantly different from the therapy the other residents were doing. The outward behaviors may be different, but at the end of the day it is all anxiety and can be addressed similarly to other anxiety disorders.\n\nThis sounds like an awfully frustrating situation. Good luck and I hope he can get the help he needs. And if you have any questions about my experience with SM or my recovery, feel free to ask. If you are willing to travel, there is the SMart Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who works with thousands of kids with SM. Here is a link to their website so you can see if they are a good fit.   Thank you. If we could afford to travel, I absolutely would. I will look at Louise Tedford, though. We are certainly at the point where that is our only option - to give someone experienced in anxiety and willing to learn about SM.\n\nThank you for your advice and willingness to help more.  I know this is a late response but I just found this subreddit. My son was diagnosed with SM recently and I am also having trouble finding people with experience dealing with it. What is worse is now every therapist or psychiatrist wants to talk to us because it is so rare that they want experience with it I guess. \n\nWhat you write about your child is exactly how I feel. I wish everyone knew the awesome kid that I know.  He is so smart and funny. \n\nThanks for your post, it is good to not feel alone in this. You are definitely not alone! SM is becoming more widely known, but it still is not easy to find someone with experience in treating SM if you are not near any of the bigger treatment centers like the Child Mind Institute. There is a couple of Facebook groups for people with Selective Mutism and parents of kids with Selective Mutism, if you are interested in a very active group of other parents of SM kids.", "I feel like I am a very off putting person from the outside perspective, unless you know me, so I have a question. What made you want to develop a relationship with someone who is Selectively Mute? To me it just does not seem possible that someone would take that kind of interest in me by themselves, I feel like I push anyone away before anything that like that would ever happen. I think you should take a dive into finding out whether you have Asperger's syndrome. I am pretty sure I have it and sometimes you sound so similar to me so yeah I am a teacher. One of my students seemed to have SM a while back and I went through the usual cycle: I initially saw it as defiance, because she seemed to be a loud, outgoing, \"normal\" girl for lack of a better term, i.e. when doing meme jokes with friends and whatnot, yet she would be incapable of speaking to answer simple questions like if I would ask for a sentence to kick off a grammar lesson, or ask her to share her work. \n\nBut it did not really add up: her work was great. She was clearly engaged in the class and learning. She would make silly jokes at me in the hallway which I now recognize as her way of bonding with people. But she would just \"freeze.\" So how could it be defiance? I would had a lot of shy kids; this was something else. \n\nGoogling around I came across SM. I immediately apologized to her as soon as I could for putting her on the spot so often and resolved to include better methods for her to participate in class. It sucks knowing that she will be dealing with that for a long time, and the block it will put on some of her relationships, but I wanted to improve our academic relationship as best I could anyway, simply to make my class not painful for her.", "Does anyone who had SM for years as a kid ever wonder why no one ever did anything/noticed something was wrong? Idk it just seems very strange to me lol. Bc thinking back on my elementery and middle school experiences im just so confused why everyone was so accepting of it? \n\nLike I did not speak at all in school for 7 years and had no friends, and people noticed of course but they kind of just thought I was shy and weird. And now im like, why did no one think that was cause for concern? Bc that is very obvious mentally ill child behavior Everyone just assumed I was shy and expected me to grow out of it. When I was in high school and still struggled to do any verbal assignments, my mom got me diagnosed. I was supposed to go to therapy, but it was hard to talk to a doctor when, ya know, I could not talk to people. So I stopped going. My parents briefly did take me to some kind of child psychologist, I think, but it did not amount to any real progress.\n\nThey could not afford to keep seeing him long, and I did not talk to the guy anyway. They also did not like the idea of putting me on medication, and neither did I. The only advice from psychologists that I remember is that they would bribe me/buy me toys when I talked to my dad. idk if that is ever effective? lol\n\nSo I was diagnosed and my teachers knew I had SM, but nothing else was really done to help me. I can talk significantly more today, yet I am still far from...normal. It is so frustrating when you go to a mental health professional because you cannot talk and they force you to talk about why you cannot talk. My girlfriend has (has had?) SM. \n\nUntil i met her i had 0 idea something like SM existed, and its probably the same reason nobody picks up on it, as it is(atleast where i live) not that well-known of a mental illness. My 11th grade teacher told my parent about me not talking at school. However, because I was so normal at home; they dont feel like something wrong at all.  When they talk to me about this, I dont know how to respond and just laugh it off, physically. At school, I found ways to make my non-verbal explainable; so sometimes I can felt people afraid of me. Moreover, school in my country dont have much support for kids with mental health problems. People just assumed that I was shy, maybe it is because not alot of people know about selective mutism. like everybody else said, they assumed i was just shy and would grow out of it. and my SM is kind of flipped, so i doubt that helped. i could talk perfectly in school and i was a very outgoing and pretty loud kid. but at home and everywhere but school, i was (still am) unable to talk to anybody unless it was my mom. when i was 9ish, some big life things happened, and i ended up moving states to stay with my aunt. i did not talk to her, my uncle, my cousins, nobody. only people at school. my aunt/uncle found out about that and thought i was purposely not talking to them. they took me to a psychologist, and when it did not work after a few sessions, they just stopped taking me. i guess their logic was \"she does not talk at home, but she talks at school, so she must be fine.\" thankfully i do not live there anymore and now that i am older and know what SM is, it is a bit easier to manage. i am definitely not cured though, and i still hear plenty of \"oh, she is just shy.\" and \"she does not talk much.\" I think it is a societal-level problem with neurological issues being seen as not as urgent as physical problems, or even shameful. People do not learn about these psychological disorders unless they have them or are close to people who do. A lot of mental disorders just go undiagnosed because of this. They would sooner accept that you will \"grow out of it\",  \"it is just a phase\" especially when you are a kid than acknowledge that there was a serious problem. Hindsight always makes it seem more obvious my parents knew about my twin and i\u2019s SM at a pretty early age, like 3 or 4, and they got someone to help us both talk, like a speech therapist. but it did not help much lol, we both ended up not speaking in school anyway. it was just pretty much accepted as severe shyness in school I think. not many people know about SM so they just end up thinking it is something you can easily grow out of. My parents were the worst of all. The more they said I was an embarrassment, people did not like me and I was just spoiled, the worse my anxiety got, but the subsequent deeper silence just reinforced their idea that I was just a bad kid throwing tantrums.\n\nI think my mom was plain unable to understand the situation because of her childhood trauma/abuse. She felt disrespected and that was all that mattered. But there were plenty of people who agreed and enabled her. Including teachers and mental health professionals. But critically, I was not able to communicate with them. So it is not like I was diagnosed with a conduct disorder or anything.\n\nNow that I think about it, that is actually a scary diagnosis to receive. A kid might just not be near someone educated on his issue. What advice or suggestions would you have for teachers? I am a teacher with a student that has SM. We are trying to brainstorm ideas for ways to communicate with this student. \n\nThey do seem to be fine with using signs for basic things like yes, no, and bathroom. ( Parent of a kid with sm and every kid is different but allowing non verbal communication just makes it worse. If they learn they can avoid it, they will continue to avoid it. Try activities one on one. Something with choices you can discuss. Like coloring and talk about picking colors with a forced choice question like red or green. It can start non verbal but keep setting the expectation for verbal and eventually they will. It will take time. Maybe a lot of time. My specialist talks about certain environments being poisoned, for my kid its school and it takes a lot of effort to un poison it. ( this site has really good resources, and reccomendations for possible accomodations that could help in school. Coming from someone who has recovered from SM twice, I would not really recommend this. I was told to do pretty much the opposite. Setting a strong expectation of speech might sound helpful in theory, but SM runs on the expectation of speech. Any sensed pressure will make it impossible to get the words out. As far as forced choices questions, that does work, but it depends on where the SMer is as far as communication. For an SMer who is comfortable but not quite there yet, forced choice questions may work. But for an SMer who is severely inhibited and struggles to even communicate nonverbally at all, it is not going to get you anywhere at all. I recommend checking out the selective mutism centers page:  Like I said every kid is different. We are working with a psychologist that specializes in Sm. For a teacher who has little time theres only so much they can do but I cannot see allowing the stagnation to be good thing. My parents did know something was wrong but yeah, they did nothing about it except yell at me for not speaking up. That was all they did. I am 27 now but a few days ago my mom just told me that at every single parent teacher conference ever the teachers always told her \"there is something wrong with this kid she does not talk\" but my mom would just say well she is normal at home and ignore it. I wish I got help back then. I still struggle with it and it is still ruining my life. I was very quiet till my teens and occasionally spoke and no one really even noticed. It was imho a violent home with lots of screaming and shouting and no one listening to me. I did not feel safe at all. If I see kids like that honestly I would like to help them. People did notice something was wrong, but no one really put effort into helping me.  Their \"help\" basically amounted to telling me to \"speak up\" and \"just talk more\".  Since I spoke at home and was getting good grades, no one really took the problem seriously.  It did not help that the teachers would hammer into our heads about how \"school is a place for learning, not socializing\" (not directed towards me specifically, just the class in general when people were talking when they were not supposed to).  So the teachers considered me one of the good kids, even though they did not like that I did not want to raise my hand in class.  And I kind of took that to heart a little too much, and assumed that since I was doing okay academically, then it was not really a problem that I could not talk to people.  Well joke's on me, and it turns out that having social skills is way more important in life than getting straight A's in middle school. Saaaame. SM and social anxiety are really more debilitating than people assume because they are not as obvious and \"loud\" as other disorders. I wonder this all the time. Not back then, but now, as an adult. I had SM from ages 3-15, although at the time no one had ever heard of it. My parents thought I was being stubborn and disrespectful, and were always upset with me. My teachers seemed to think the same - that I chose not to talk. I basically never got any kind of help for it and cured myself as a teenager, thought it was not easy and I was very much alone. Now as an adult I have been in therapy for 10 years trying to deal with the aftermath, and realizing it had much more of an effect on my than I thought. Glad to find this group and know that I am not alone though :)", "Check out this free personality test- it takes less than 5 minutes and will give you tips to better yourself  Some people will say the the roots of the personality typing system goes back to the Kabbalah and/or a Russian mystic from a few hundred years ago but it is generally accepted that the structure of the actual test is much more recent. An enneagram is a nine-sided star, each of the nine tips of the star represents a different personality type and is given a name and number. What defines each personality type is that they have one great strength, like courage or observation, and since they are so good at this one thing they overuse it in their life. So their greatest strength can also control them in a sense if overused.    \n\nAn interesting thing about the test is if a person can pick up positive traits by integrating parts of the personality type connected to it by a line- since it is a nine-sided star each point has a line moving toward two different points across from it. And in the same way if they pick up negative traits they move toward the other point. So a 7 may be connected to a 3 and a 4, for example, so all type 7 people can look at the positive traits of a 3 to know what traits they should try to pick up and a 4 to know which traits they should try to use (those numbers are not right, just giving examples).    \n\nI am thinking that a lot of us will be of the same personality type as me. I can send anyone that wants one a link of traits to try to integrate into your everyday life for self-improvement. I just took the test and apparently I am the 'peacemaker'! That is interesting, I am an observer/investigator. I expect a lot of us will be observers- I used to spend so much time observing that I did not talk in most situations unless spoken to, but maybe that is just me. Well I mean that was part of it with me but not the only reason. Okay so i took the test again on various websites and they all give me different results lol. One says I am the \"perfectionist\", another says I am the \"loyalist\"... hmmm... or am I answering the questions differently? I got an equal amount of all of them. I do not know what that means lol There is no official test so some people or groups approach the test slightly different, the test that I linked has that feature which I have never seen before- the different group scores or whatnot. I received a 5 on 4 of the groups that would mean I am definitely an Observer, whereas some people are more of a mix. You should have a dominant personality type though, some tests are going to be more accurate than others and there are many levels to the system.    \n\nIf you look at this pic I linked you can see what I mean- I am an Observer, if I pick up unhealthy traits then I move more toward being a Generalist, if I pick up healthy traits then I move toward being a Leader. With me being an Observer my primary strength is my observational powers, so if I use them too much (like I do) then I get stuck in my head and use all of my time acquiring knowledge without experiencing life. If I were to be a more active participant in life then I would be more aggressive and a much better leader instead of always trying to prepare for life and never getting out there in the real world.    \n\n\n\nSo you may be a really healthy person psychologically and that would mean you have a diverse set of strengths so you have a less dominant personality type which would be the opposite of me essentially. This test may not work as good for someone like that because of variations in the questions whereas another test may not work as good for someone like me. There is several more levels to the test, you see how the star is divided into three triads? 5, 6, and 7 are in the Head/Thinking triad. 8, 9, and 1 are in the Gut/Body triad. 2, 3, and 4 are in the Heart/Feeling triad. And each of the nine types also tend toward one of the nine deadly sins if they are unhealthy. There is other levels to it as well but I think that is the major ones. There are a few different variations of the personality system, they are really similar in major aspects but they use different names for some of the personality types and the questions can vary. There is no official test so some will be more accurate than others, the one that I linked has a feature that I have never seen before which is it shows you nine different 'group scores.' Since I received 5 on 4 of the groups that would mean I am a very dominant Observer whereas someone else may be more of a mix which would probably make them more healthy psychologically- they should still have a dominant personality type though like I mentioned to the other person that commented. A different user deleted their comment so I will copy and paste my reply to them here.    \n\nIf you look at this pic I linked you can see what I mean- I am an Observer, if I pick up unhealthy traits then I move more toward being a Generalist, if I pick up healthy traits then I move toward being a Leader.

Peacemaker and Perfectionist are very similar in this sense so I would say you are probably one of them. Wow this personality test is really in depth and its blowing my mind rn lol. Yeah it is really crazy that a personality test can tell you so much about yourself, the first time I took one I was like \"wow this test knows me better than anyone in my life probably.\" I saw a quote somewhere that said \"The Myers-Brigg test tells you how the world see you, the Enneagram shows how you see the world.\"    \n\nI probably should have used a better title for this post so more people would have took it, but I usually have trouble summarizing in a few words. : /", "How to help online partner with selective mutism? Sorry if the grammar here is bad, I am not very smart\n\nMy online partner is amazing and I love texting them (we use discord) We have been together for 6 months and I have been wanting to vc so I could feel closer and talk more fluently if that makes sense. They have not said for sure but when we do vc they type and stay muted so I am guessing they are not comfortable with talking. Should I leave it be and just not vc? I do not want to put them in a hard situation and I really care about them. I would be willing not to call if that is the best thing to do, texting is still nice, but if there is a way to do it that would be comfortable for them I would like that :)\n\nI also feel like I should add that as of right now we have not met irl and are both minors so we cannot arrange anything by ourselves. In vc i usually play games with my friends and I feel like it would be difficult to check discord messages while playing a game (again i am willing to sacrifice this if its the best way) Really it is best if you ask your partner about this directly, not some random people on the internet.  especially because it varies from person to person. Maybe they like listening to your voice even if they cannot speak themselves. Or perhaps it makes them very anxious. I could not tell you what your partner is thinking. Text is definitely naturally less pressure because of the asynchronity.\n\nJust be careful not to indirectly pressure them to speak. It is very easy to unintentionally put pressure on someone even if you are saying it is okay if they dont talk. Eg. Try not to bring attention to speaking at all. Do not say things like \"I wish you could speak to me!\" things like that tend to make people feel bad. They prolly want to more than anyone. We also have our own discord server by the way.\n\n", "I am a 16 y/o with Selective Mutism. Ask me anything! Selective Mutism is an anxiety disorder that causes me to go \"mute\" in public (ex, school), especially to adults, but I can speak perfectly fine at home and to some people that I am especially close with. I have had it for as long as I can remember, but I believe I was diagnosed in 2nd grade. AMA if you are curious about it.", "Writing a character with selective mutism first, hi, hello, thank you for taking the time to read this\n\nso, as the title says, I am writing a character with selective mutism, but I do not I have selective mutism myself and I would like to *not* write inaccurately something that is already misunderstood and unknown. I have done what I believe to be a big part of the research but there are a few things that I would like to clear up and ask if that is not too much of a bother to answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I read that even with the ones you can talk to (close people), it can be hard to explain/ express emotions/ enter into deep subjects about yourself to the point of shutting down and not being able to speak. Is this true?\n2. (kind of a follow up to the 1st but in a more broad area) Even with close people, there are moments where you cannot talk to them either because of being too anxious/ not having a good day/or something else that happened?\n3. in the moments where you cannot talk, could it be compared to the words being pulled down or them being stuck on your throat?\n4. if you are angry enough with someone who you would not normally talk to, you would argue/shout with them? (I know it depends on the person though)\n5. (follow up to the 4th) if you do argue/shout with them, would you have a similar reaction after being forced to talk along with the rush that anger/frustration brings you? (I know it depends on the person though)\n6. some misconceptions and bad stereotypes I should avoid? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nagain, thank you for your time :) I am not as mute as some in that I can always get some words out, but here goes:\n\n1. This is true for me.  No matter how comfortable I am with a person, it is always possible to get into a tough conversation and shut down or want to flee.\n2. Umm I can get moody after a bad day and not want to talk about it.  I think that is normal though.  But I never really arrive shut down to someone I am close to, like I would to other people.\n3. I do not know if I should answer this, since I can always at least get out some Yes/No/I Do not Know answers.  I do not feel like words are stuck; more like I cannot find the words.  It is sort of like when you are trying to think of the name of something and drawing a blank.  \n4. I do not think I have ever yelled at someone that I was not close to.  \n5. n/a\n6. I would not want to see this character find confidence and then be cured of their SM.  It might make for a good story, that is not how it works and I personally would not be a fan of that. 1. I am not exactly sure what you mean by this?  If it is someone I can freely talk to, I am fine  speaking in depth on subject that interest me.\n2. Yes, I am usually not up for speaking in the morning and usually avoid engaging in conversation with my family (who I am fine talking to).\n3. No, not for me. It is more like being stuck on the other side of a wall where people can see you, and you can hear them but they cannot hear you. I answer and engage in conversation in my head, it just never make it out of my head.\n4. Maybe? There was this one time I got into a fight with someone who provoked other classmates, my friend and then me. So it was a long build up to that and I was on meds at the time so I would say, rare but possible.\n5. Not sure what you are asking here either.\n6.  Making your character cute/shy or infantilizing them. I am not shy and like being around people even though it stresses me out and I cannot talk to them. I hate seeing mutes depicted like this because I am not like that at all.\n\nThank you for asking questions. If you have any more, feel free to ask them or send me a message. I am a writer too, and if you want someone to be a sensitivity reader for your work or just give insight to living with SM, I would be happy to. Hello. Ex SM here. (I had SM up until 15ish)\n\n1. For me no. I was able to talk about difficult topics completely fine.\n2. For me no. The thing that made me 'mute' was the people I was talking too- not the situation. I was certainly more talkative in private, but only because of the risk of being overheard by 'not safe people'. I was able to deal with stressful situations fine. It was just stressful people that was the issue.\n3. For me it was like standing at the edge of a high cliff. You CAN jump, but your body just does not let you because some unconscious part of your brain knows it is fatal. No matter how much you want to jump, your muscles simply do not comply to your will.\n4. No. Anger would not allow me to speak to someone who was not 'safe', and trust me, I got pretty damn angry. People would even purposefully antagonise me, and still I was silent.\n\nOne thing that is often said about people with SM is that- if there was a situation in which you would die if you did not speak- many SM people would just die. I always felt like this was true for me. At primary school (up to age 11) I was often given the choice of eating or simply saying \"please\", so I did not eat. Another testimonial I once saw on facebook decribed how many people with SM would feel unable to even shout \"help\" if trapped in a burning building.\n\n5)  No idea what this is asking.\n\n6) One misconception is that SM is a symptom of autism. This is not true. Though it can be comorbid, many people have SM without also having autism. Much of media shows nonverbal autistic children and refers to them as having SM, this is not true. SM is not the same as being nonverbal due to autism/\n\nA second misconception is that SM is due to trauma. The majority of SM in children in media is due to trauma, but this is NOT true in real life. VERY few SM cases can be traced back to trauma. Though SM can be triggered by trauma the majority of cases are in no way linked to trauma (although children with ANY mental health condition or mental illness are more likely to be abused as a child- this would come after developing the condition).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are many resources in the subreddits wiki about SM, the book \"selective mutism in our own words\" is one that I feel is very representative of what I experienced as a child,\n\nI would also be careful when writing characters with SM. Representation is good, but mental illness for the sake of making a character 'more interesting' can often come across as cheap and unnecessary. 1) I really struggle with opening up with those I am close to, I am pretty avoidant in general. I am embarrassed to say that I have \"ghosted\" a lot of people, including romantic relationships because I just cannot.\n\n2) I feel like this is separate, and just more of a general anxiety response or feeling overwhelmed by society/existence/whatever.\n\n3) Do you mean when I am anxious or around people I am not comfortable with? I would say my words get stuck or feel hard to express and then once I say something I feel my cheeks go red (not sure if they actually do...) and then a sigh of relief once I say my piece.\n\n4) I have only had this when I worked retail and I would have a hard time regulating my emotions, I would not yell, but I eventually got into the habit of leaving. Then I ghosted that workplace.\n\n5) I do not know how to answer this.\n\n6) I can say from my experience, I have struggled with SM since I was a small child, before I can remember. I feel like I have grown past SM, but I am here cause it is nice to be part of that community and have validation for who I was. I am still a very quiet person and struggle with adding to conversations, I feel like having had SM as a child I never fully learned how to... converse with people, especially those not part of my close comfort zone. I do not have severe SM anymore but it still comes through a lot and can be different for everybody so here some answers:  \n\n\n1. I have a very hard time explaining things like emotions or very personal feelings around difficult topics. My old therapist once told me to try to describe my feelings as best as I could if I cannot pin it down to a specific word like \"sad\" or \"angry\".  \nIt creates a lot of problems when I try to speak with close friends because I am not able to be clear and start to overexplain a lot which creates more confusion.  \nIn therapy it was very hard to open up at first. I could not say a lot about myself and I would just shut down when I get asked how xyz made me feel.\n\n2. I have very close friends where I still get very anxious for no reason when I want to talk about topics that could hurt them or I want to critique them.   \nExample: Had to speak with my roommate and best friend how she drive our water and heating bill up. In my head I was very determined but my voice and body was shaking. I often need to take a short silent break and take some breathes before I continue to try and talk slowly. I am very glad to have friends who are patient even with critique lol\n3. Not for me. It is like my mind becomes completely blank and I just do not know any words to say. Feels like I never learned a language to speak.\n\n4. I cannot shout. In school I had a moment where I was annoyed enough that I turned around and told them to SHUT UP!!11 very stern and loud enough for others to hear.  \nI almost died that day because classmates never heard me talk and said if the quiet person has to say it, they must have been damn annoying.\n\n5. Do not really understand the question either.\n\n6. SM does not mean the person is an introvert. I am not very tall and look a bit frail and got myself that misconception that I am very shy and like to stay at home. My family is always suprised on how many friends I made at conventions, festivals or concerts. I love to go out, party and get to know new people. Being alone in big masses of people and holding conversations is hard and exhausting but I have good people around me who do not need many words, help me with panic attacks etc. and make the whole experience so much better.  \nAlso most people do not know SM. They do not automatically connect it to anxiety or a disorder because they do not know about it. I was always the very quiet kid. A bit odd but I was popular once people got to know me. 6. For me, when it comes to recovery you have to have a very real motive, for me it was a girl....though that faded, and that motive faded. My Dad will give me his '03 Cobra Mustang if I start to talk fully...that does not work for motivation still. It feels like it is too far away and unknown as to when that goal can even be achieved. 1. Yes and it causes a lot of problems with my relationships because I will have reasonable feelings but they never hear about them and it causes me so much stress and frustration. I end up lashing out over something that is not emotionally affecting me. I do that because it allows me to at least address some type of problem, and feel like I have a sense of control when really I do not and the real issue is not being solved. \n2. Yes and I have never been able to open up to anyone about it so when I cannot talk to them I end up being rude about the interaction because I am annoyed that they are talking to me when i would rather not speak, and the only way I can get them to stop speaking to me is to be rude about it. I wish I did not do this. I am trying my best though and no one seems to understand that. \n3. Yes. And when I absolutely have to speak its extremely difficult for me to speak at a good volume. I am afraid of speaking too loud so I end up speaking very softly and no matter how much I try and force myself to speak louder, it comes out very tiny. I think my throat getting caught has something to do with it. Its as if my voice box is constricted. I wonder if there is a physical medical explanation for this? Like are my muscles actually squeezing my throat? \n4. Yes. I find it easier to express my deep emotions to someone who does not know me. Very many random people know very personal details about me. I am also autistic so the social boundaries thing I have to work on. \n5. I am glad I am not the only one who did not fully understand this question. Are you trying to ask if I am capable of speaking just normal after a yelling match? Am I capable of conversing with someone that I have yelled at? No. If i have argued with someone before on anything, and we have never been friends or spoken before the argument, then I cannot be friendly with them. We crossed too far into the anger zone and I cannot back track. Even with people I have conversed with prior to the argument, I cannot physically feel okay talking normal with them once we have argued. The conversation feels tainted. \n6. That I do not have anything on my mind. That I am clueless to the world around me. That I am not actively participating in the conversation in my head, because I am. \nI saw someone say its not due to trauma, and mine is not due to trauma because I was born like this. However, my trauma made it worse. I was screamed at and beat and all that all the time at home and I was so afraid of coming across that way in a school setting so I stayed silent instead of trying to speak. I also at the same time tried really hard to speak, but I wanted to come across as a normal person and could not. So when I did speak, if I messed up, it ruined my day and pushed me into a deeper pit.\n\nI \u201covercame\u201d my SM by forcing myself to say every thought I had, including the ones I dont agree with. I wish I never did that because Im also OCD and my intrusive thoughts are horrible. I wanted so badly to present myself in the way that i truly am, and did it wrong. Now I feel like everyone hates me because of my weird intrusive thoughts that I said out loud. Hey, check it out! This comment contains every letter in the alphabet.\n                        \n\nI have checked 285043 comments and 1269 of them contain every letter in the alphabet. I had a similar situation happen freshman year, this girl kept interrupting class to talk about herself and I kept thinking \u201cnobody cares\u201d over and over in my head and then I just blurted it out and the whole class got quiet in agreement with me. Was real awkward for me. This pleases me. Here are my answers, but it is important to remember that everyone experiences things differently, and there is no completely universal SM experience;\n\n1. Yes, even when my mutism was not as bad I still always shut down when getting into difficult/ sensitive subjects, no matter who I was talking to or how comfortable I was otherwise\n\n2. Yes. If I was too anxious or overwhelmed or stressed or whatever I would go completely mute, no saying anything to anyone, even those I was most comfortable with\n\n3. Sometimes? Like, sometimes I will know exactly what to say, and will *want* to say it, even try to force it out, but it feels like the words are caught in my throat. But other times I have the words in my head but my mouth just will not say them, but there is no physical feeling. Other times still I just will not have any words to say\n\n4. I have not, but I have felt like I was going to a few times. Not sure if I ever actually would, but some people probably do. Also, if I did it would wear out my voice quick and my throat would get real sore real fast. I would not be able to keep it up for long and I would feel it for the rest of the day at least \n\n5. Sorry, I do not really understand this question?\n\n6. Absolutely agree with everything everyone else here has said. Also want to add that recovery for SM is often as physical as it is mental. You cannot just be silent or near-silent for weeks or months and then start talking just like anyone else would. Depending on how much your character talks, their voice may be really quiet, rough, squeaky, whatever. And if they start talking any more than usual they will probably end up with a sore throat. And if they really do not talk much at all, they may have to re-learn how to control things like volume or even breathing while talking. At least, that is been the case for me &gt;Its as if my voice box is constricted. I wonder if there is a physical medical explanation for this? Like are my muscles actually squeezing my throat?\n\nWhen I was in elementary school kids used to always ask me if it had something to do with my throat and I always said no. I wonder if I was being misleading because now that I can talk to people (sometimes) about 70% of the time it comes out as a high-pitched, shrill voice. It is quite embarrassing for me and I wonder if there is a way to stop that from happening. I asked this question. This is a good answer to it! \n\n 1. I would do whatever it took to avoid talking about myself if the subject touched upon something I was ashamed or embarrassed about. I did not completely shut down, but there would be so much anxiety in my stomach as I uttered a response. (My response would be minimal btw)\n\n2. Depends on how close. I am good around family although I do not talk about my true feelings with them either. With friends, I have moments of anxiety where I am afraid today's finally going to be the day when they realize I am a loser and ditch me. This anxiety has screwed me over on lots of hangouts.\n\n3. There were rare moments when I felt words stuck in my throat. What usually happened for me was that I would want to talk, then get scared I would say the wrong thing. Then I would freeze as though paralyzed and feel trapped in my body. This was me in grades 4-11, when I was at my worst.\n\n4. My kid self did until around 4th grade. Then I shamed myself into holding it in cuz I had arguments with lots of other kids, and I realized the problem was probably me. Current me has lots of suppressed anger but difficulty expressing it. I am working on accepting that anger rather than shaming it so I will be able to express myself more freely. I love badass characters like sailor mars and 'the girl with the dragon tattoo' cuz these characters express their anger so freely \n\n5. I usually cannot clearly come up with words when angry. So I have backed out of arguments because my brain could not come up with a retort. It was super, super frustrating \n\n6. Idk what the stereotypes are tbh. I was definitely the girl who did not talk for many years tho. Nowadays, people say I am very reserved. I also have a hard time speaking audibly because I hear my own voice so clearly but do not know what I sound like to others. When I try to speak louder, it feels like I do not have enough air for it, and my stomach feels tired.\n\n\nIn addition to these questions, here is a recent thread from another writer who wants to write a character with SM for u to check out:\n It is incredibly brave of you to force yourself to say all the thoughts in your head.  It may not end up with good results with people, but I really admire your bravery \ud83d\udc4d I went the opposite direction and always envied people who were vocal Agreed on number 6. SM is not that easily cured. thank you for your answer! thanks for taking your time to answer! thanks for your answers in this! And relating to number 6, I am glad that I had already no intent of magically cure SM when is clearly something that takes time. just to clarify, I was already having that into account but thank you for your concern! thank you for your answers! I wrote the character first, traits, personality, etc before the SM, it is not the only ''interesting'' thing about them. thank you for answering! I am sorry that the world was not fair with you and you had to go through that. \n\nUnasked but If it helps (if not, just ignore it and I am sorry), it is impossible for everyone to hate you, your intrusive thoughts that you said out loud would not be the only thing to make someone hate you, there would have to be other factors involved (if someone said something weird and blunt, would you hate them or maybe confused?). thank you for your answers! I will have the last point in mind when writing them! thank you for your reply! I am sure you will be getting there in the future, conversations can be hard and most of the time, do not make much sense (at least, I am sure mine do not) but I hope you will get the hang of it. thanks for the reply! I hope your motivation finds you or you find it in the future. thank you for the answers! And also for the link! I am in my 30s and do not really care. I can manage in most situations if need be. I have figured out that most people like to talk about themselves so if i ask questions and keep them talking i do not have to do much. Thank you, and np 1. For me, I used to be talkative normal to my parents and shy/mute to strangers, then over time in teenhood, I stopped talking to them and stopped showing my face expressions to them and generally only answered short words when asked questions or nod/shake head/shrug, but I can talk normalish to strangers now. I never met others with SM before, so dunno how common or rare it is.\n2. It does not matter what mood I am in, even when we are having a blast watching a comedy that I would normally laugh loud with a best friend or lover that I am open with, I would not laugh in front of my parents and cover my mouth if i smile OR stifle the smile into a neutral expression (but still be laughing in my head).\n3. It is stuck in my head/brain, not even on my throat or mouth.\n4. No. I was physically and emotionally abused and tortured as a child (not by parents but another relative), and it never made me speak or even vocalize at all. I would endure it entirely and resist saying anything even if I was being beaten or even immediate danger (involving fire). The fear made me think I will die or make things worse if I do talk.\n5. ?\n6. I have not seen selective mutism shown in media, but I would say just avoid confusing it or making it too much of \"just shy\", or \"just awkward\". Though it is definitely awkward and shy in those situations, it is not like that at all when around the right person (for me). I act very stiff and shy and quiet around those I am SM to, but to the few people I do talk normal to, I also act like myself, which is very goofy and childish and playful (with some normal shyness still of course).", "Selective Mutism sermon I am working on a small speech about my life and Selective Mutism sermon with my church. We will have an expert speak too and I will just talk about my experiences with it and the trauma I experienced. I might try sharing it here if allowed and everything goes as planned. \n\nMy question is, what is important for other people to here that I can include. Most of it will just be my story, but I do not know how to tell people how to help me. \n\nWhat do I say that would help a liberal congregation help me in areas like dating and just feel safe speaking? Well, I think the most important thing is to tell them to spread the word about the condition, be it online or in person since awareness for SM is so abysmally low. Also, be very specific about the condition, cause what I found is that its EXTREMELY easy for normal people to misinterpret the condition or try to tell you they have it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for dating, idk much about you but lemme just say I have a lot of trouble as well. Just know that you are not alone, and any mistakes you might make will absolutely not matter in the long run. Yep, will do.", "What is your zodiac sign?  Virgo, apparently. I had to look it up, though. I never really got into the zodiac much. My zodiac sign is Aquarius.", "I do not enjoy talking to people online There is nobody I can talk to irl other than my dad and brother. I have tried making online friends but it never works out and it is my fault. The people that are actually willing to talk to me I do not really get along with. We have nothing in common and cannot get past small talk. I can see them trying to make an effort when we have no chemistry. I do not know if i am just a bad person or I actually just do not have chemistry with most people.\n\nThe people I actually want to talk to never talk to me. I spend a lot of time on twitter and that is where I find people. I rarely tweet myself but when I do a lot of the same people like and comment on my stuff. I see them as friends even though we rarely talk and I know they all have real lives I am the exact same way. I have very few online friends, and one irl. Shes been my friend since kindergarten and I am 26 now. It is super lonely sometimes, especially when shes so busy. I used to have super bad anxiety to even talk online and cannot make online friends even now. So same. The most I really do is post on tumblr, probably the least social social media. I feel this. I have lost the only 3 friendships I have had, when I graduated high school. They only ever wanted anything to do with me on Facebook Messenger. They did not bother to hang out with me since I do not speak.\n\nI am basically a closet Gothic metal head and, needless to say, I do not exactly fit in with the basic country wannabes in my state. I would just rather let friendships die off when we do not share anything in common. But, loneliness is a beach though.\n\nWhenever I talked to one friend on Facebook, it would consist of nothing but small talk. \"How are you doing? \" Blah blah blah. I would get so bored from it and just did not want to engage through it. I am definitely more of a social butterfly online than off. I use to have tons of online friends before they all abandoned me, now I have two. \n\nI am very vocal and outspoken online to the point I will start fights with people \u2014 thinking  maybe there is a good reason I have SM. I know exactly how you feel. I do not have any friends online. I almost have to put on a facade and act completely different than who I really am just for people to like me. Even when doing that, its still impossible. I cant keep a conversation going to save my life. The friendships basically end when they ask for my skype/discord. Its hard enough having to try to communicate online, but now I have to talk? no way. so I just give up.", "I had my first ever job interview today!! So Im 18 and I was diagnosed with selective mutism when I was quite young. I had a job interview today and I was really nervous, I thought I would end up freezing up or just not being able to say everything I want to say. I used to be so scared to talk to people even online but I have made progress with that! I also have a temporary job as a cleaner which is not much socialising but yeah... I only got it because I know the manager. At work there is only really one person I kind of talk to but I am not able to say what I want to say, like I just cant. Even when I have practiced things in my head a lot, so only 1-2 worded answers come out. I think i am so used to people not wanting to talk to me as well so that makes it harder. No one else really talks to me there and I know people say I am very quiet and one guy even asked me if I was shy to my face. I hate being called shy but I kind of panicked and said yes? Anyways this is not the point of this post. \n\nSo as I said, I had a job interview today and was so anxious about it but I was able to answer the questions and talk with my interviewer and I actually felt really relaxed, I did not feel much anxiety while I was there either. I managed to say most of what I wanted to say and it felt like I did not even have selective mutism at that time. I do still struggle with it though (especially around some family members and friends). I do not know if I got the job yet but I am so proud of myself for actually being able to go through with the interview. The job is at costa coffee so if I do get it, I will have to speak to a lot more people and try to form relationships with other staff which is hard for me but I will try as hard as I can. I just wrote this to basically say that it is possible to do things like this, even though it can be really hard? Hopefully it was helpful for anyone struggling. I did not think I would be able to do it but I pushed myself to go and do it and I practiced a lot. I am still shocked that I actually did it! Hopefully I do get the job... Either way I am really happy and proud of myself for going! Proud of you! Either way you did something good for yourself :) That is awesome! I am also going to be looking for a job soon and this really inspired me.", "Does any of you were undiagnosed with selective mutism mainly because people thought you were just shy but manage to outgrow selective mutism? I never went to a psychologist or therapist. But I knew I was different as a kid and when I read about selective mutism, I could relate to the symptoms. I think I had outgrown it now though. \n\np.s sorry for my English (it is my second language) SM tends to be caused by anxiety and pressure. Throughout your life, you will find you are in many different environments and respond to them by becoming many different kinds of people. This is not saying that there is not a genuine you beneath everything, but the way you interact with and respond to the world will change and evolve. \n\nIt took until i moved in with my first partner, and them demonstrating and reassuring me every time that they could wait, I did not need to talk if i did not want to or could not, and so on. Eventually, it rewired my brain to no longer be anxious about going mute. To be clear, i still do go mute, but i can go years between episodes now (and they are usually autism related as well, meaning they are unlikely to go away entirely).\n\nIt is about finding the right environment with the right people who support you without pressuring you, but are always there even if you \"fail\". People who do not say you NEED to do something, but they will be around whether you do or not. It is hard to find, harder for some than others, but it is possible. Yeah, I am middle aged so when I was a kid back then nobody knew about selective mutism.  It was not really wrong to assume I was shy.  Shyness is anxiety, but selective mutism is anxiety off the charts. I bearly talked in years 10-11 but now I am in college and have a job I find it easier to talk, I did small things at first and worked my way up. Small talk is shit but try it it helped me I did not realize why sm was until I was in my 40\u2019s, if you are a younger person with SM get help ASAP. Yes people thought I was just \"shy.\" I was nonverbal (mostly?) for the first few years of my life. Then I picked a small select few people who I would speak to. In school though I did not speak to the other kids. It is like I could not. Nothing would come out of my mouth.\n\nAs an adult I was diagnosed with Level 2 autism and selective mutism.", "Has anyone here tried online therapy? I do not really know how it works. I have been to sooo many in person therapists and I was never able to talk to them (they all make me uncomfortable, one of them locked me in the room till i would you all, which i never did.)\n\nOnline therapists are probably too packed right now to start and I do not know if it works with local therapists or if it is just therapists around the world. And I do not know what service to use.\n\nI have tried the crisis text line hundreds of times and that was absolutely horrible. I am scared that online therapy will just be that but with money. I have never had a good therapist in my life and my dad just kind of gave up in looking for one. They are either too positive to a point it is annoying or they are mean to me.", "Public speaking in college...a success! so I posted a bit about this ( \n\nBasically, I have had SM since I was a toddler and did not have help in overcoming it. I am currently in college and needed to take a public speaking class, dropped it several times, and finally decided to go through with it this semester.\n\n...and I did it! \n\nMy first speech...felt like I bombed it. My voice was shaky, I made like zero eye contact with the audience, etc. Felt like the worst delivery in the class.\n\nBut I did not dwell on that because I was so relieved it was over and proud that I did it. The second and third speeches went way better. Thanks to the teacher offering some extra credit, I have somehow managed an A. My past self literally never would have believed I could do it.\n\nThe fact that we have to wear masks helped me (though I was also nervous about being loud enough) because I feel better having half my face covered lmao. Most people also took the option to present their speeches through Zoom, so I only had to deliver the last speech to 3 people in person. That was sweet. Personally, I have a fear of/aversion to recording my voice, so I actually prefer talking in person. \n\nSo if anyone has to do something similar, maybe this can give some hope. As a kid, I only talked to four people. Now I can complete my degree by the end of this year because I pushed myself to do something so daunting and uncomfortable. It was worth it. congrats Well done. Hey me too!! I also dropped my public speaking class twice. And then thanks to covid I got to do it on zoom to like 3 people!

Hello!\nI am an adult who has selective mutism. I also have other diagnosis's like Autism.\n\nAnyway I really want to be able to talk verbally to my therapist.

I really want to do this but the thought of this makes me feel physically sick and like someones punched me in the stomach. I refused to try today as I really want to but then the fear takes over and then yeah...\n\nAny advice? How do I start talking? as I feel hopeless about talking ever again! What I find the most easy to start with, is whispering. Sometimes I have tried to prepare a word to say, but I think I find it easiest to whisper just one word sort of spontaneous. Whatever word fits the conversation. Also, one time my teacher helped me with telling me what to whisper. A letter at a time, to spell a word. Then she helped me whisper the word, and then she did the same thing with more letters to spell more words, until we put the words together, so I could say a whole sentence. Building it up like that. Who do you normally talk to? Could they come with you to a session to see if it is possible for you to open up? Could you bring one of your \u2018safe\u2019 people to the session, if it might help you feel more comfortable? So that you would be talking to them with the webcam either on or off, and the therapist present, just making smaller steps toward talking to her. I talk to my hair dresser haha and a good friend. I would have to think how that would work during lockdown lol. But it is a good idea . Possibly. This lockdown really messes this up! \n\nBut it is an idea. When I talked to a therapist I bawled my eyes out, writing in a note pad helps tho Could you record something in advance to \"say\" to her and then play it in the session? That way you have put your voice into the relationship.\n\nIt sounds like the current plan might be making things worse for you, so I would steer away it.\n\nAre there any speech and language therapy resources/books that are aimed at adults with selective mutism? You could see lots of options and then you choose the one that feels safest/easiest/least painful to you. I have just had a thought that we could exchange voicemails.. so I am not directly speaking to her and if I do not like it then I can delete it ^^this! whispering helped me and my therapist communicate, and was the first step that really helped me get to a good place. another method was recording myself speaking and playing the tapes back-especially when it comes to yes/no/do not know. Yes, I have done that at work using WhatsApp, you can delete it if you do not like it.\n\nI hope it works out for you xx", "Anybody else find marijuana helps them talk?

Try to look them in the eyes and smile. Write a script and practice it (you can have coaching or just find them online). Do not be afraid to be honest, just try not to be rude. If you feel like you messed up, forget it immediately and try to keep a neutral/open expression. Laugh at their jokes, or at least acknowledge them with a smile. And do not forget to ask when you are going to be given feedback. If you do not get feedback by that time, ask them. If you do not get the job, you can also politely ask why, and reply to that by politely saying thank you. You may even get the job after that exchange - it happened to me.\n\nGood luck!

I have a phone interview for an internship next Thursday and I guess I was just wondering if there are any tips or tricks for SM related problems anyone can give me?? It really comes down to practicing. Practice till you build muscle memory. Do you have a friend or family member you can practice over the phone/video with? I do not have SM but also blank during high stress situations like interviews and have pretty high levels of social anxiety. I would print out expected interview questions, write answers and recite them in front of a mirror until I had them basically memorized. Then I would do \"live\" practice interviews with a friend.

Like in discord I occasionally resort to just lurking in a conversation or responding with gifs, and in live conversation I am responding mostly with facial expressions, but it is not mutism because I *can* \u201cforce\u201d myself to speak if words actually need to be said, I have a \u201cimportant social situation\u201d anxiety override of sorts, but it is not comfortable? It feels weird in my chest. And I am normally really coherent and silvertongued. When I feel this way though it is a lot more uncomfortable to try and string words into sentences, whether irl or in text, and feels like it is taking a lot of brain power to communicate with words instead of emotions and faces and pictures.\n\nThis comes and goes but lately has been happening more often. What would this be called? Do you have any recommendations for getting past it and helping it not get worse? I do not know what is causing it, but it is frustrating when other people are expecting words and I am not offering them as well as I know I can. I can definitely relate to this...I just call it \"feeling wordless,\" and end up texting emojis to people or maybe sending pictures/memes.\n\nHonestly, I do not try to change it. I just tell people I am feeling wordless, and do not get caught up in their expectations. I would love it if most people would talk less, but they usually do not, so why should I talk more? There are many ways to communicate. Words are just one way.\n\nDo you find that it happens more under certain circumstances (i.e., feeling tired or overwhelmed?) Hmm, it is not frequent enough I have been able to assign any sort of noticeable pattern to it yet, but I do think it would probably be something to do with tiredness, whether of body or brain, because words definitely feel like they take a lot of effort when it happens. Might also be a mood thing, like when I am feeling sort of\u2026 not really *mopey*, but dull? apathetic? mellow? grey ish instead of bright colors. i have this exact feeling. honestly i just go with it now, and my friends know if i do not respond verbally in real life or in text online to just keep the conversation going and that i will respond in my own time. this is partly the reason why i avoid communicating in discord channels and such. for me, this feeling occurs mostly in group conversations though, im not sure if it is the same for you? i can normally keep a conversation going pretty well one-on-one if i know the person. i remember i had friends who would put me down for this, but i cut them off, which was the right thing to do. people like that are not worth keeping around. \n\neven if you feel wordless at the time, do not beat yourself up over it, because this feeling is quite common. i am not sure if i accidentally rambled a lot above but just to summarise in case, by removing the expectation to talk, it might help! this is what worked most for me. good luck! :)", "I think my daughter may have Selective Mustism tl;dr: I am starting the process\n of seeking a professional diagnosis of selective mutism for my daughter.  This will be through the NHS, and through COVID times I expect the process will take a long time, in the meantime, can anyone help give some advice on how best to help her?\nFull\n version:  My soon to be 6 year old has always been quite withdrawn around people she is not familiar with.  My wife was always of the opinion that she would grow out of it, and that she is just a bit shy.  However, I always felt there was an underlying reason\n for it, and rather than improving, she appears to have regressed.  Neither my wife or I had heard of SM before, but after a lot of research online, it at least appears to be the closest match to her symptoms.\nWhen\n she is at home and around family/people she is familiar with, she is talkative, easily expresses emotions, likes to sing &amp; dance etc.  If we are out in a shop, park, cafe etc and someone speaks to her, she outright pretends they are not there and pretty much never\n responds.  Even at a cafe we have been gong to regularly for years, the staff always try to speak to her in a very friendly manner, and despite being quite familiar with them, she will not respond.\nWhat\n started off as her ignoring people when encountering these situations, gradually progressed to her making strange expressions, typically looking up to the ceiling whilst opening and closing her mouth.  And in recent months she started to literarily scream\n when someone speaks to her, and immediately turning around and clinging onto my leg.  I feel we maybe partly responsible for making things worse, due to putting under pressure to respond to people, because we viewed it as being rude/bad manners.\nI\n first spoke to my daughter about it a few months back, and she was very reluctant to talk about it.  She is recently opened up to me about it, I suspect this breakthrough has come from me trying to show some understanding, and reassuring her that she does not\n have to speak and that we love her no matter what.  What she has told me, in her words are that she gets very scared when strangers speak to her, and she cannot explain why.  She says she wants to talk, but she just cannot, and at school she will only speak\n to teachers if she really has to.\nIt is\n quite upsetting to see sometimes, when she talks about how excited she is to go to a party yet when she gets to the party she freezes.  I play a lot of football (soccer to you Americans!) with her and she plays well with me, yet when I take her to football\n training she finds it hard to communicate with the coach &amp; other children, she becomes withdrawn and therefore does not show what she is capable of.\nWith\n all of this said, I kind of feel as though I can sympathise her as I think I may have a mild form of SM myself.  I was outgoing as a kid, but from my mid teens onwards I have found it increasingly difficult to express my voice freely around large groups.  I\n can speak to people on a professional basis, but when around unfamiliar people on a social level, my voice seems to tighten and I cannot tell jokes or speak in an expressive tone.  Maybe I have passed this on to her?\nTo\n finish off, I just want to make it clear that I do not feel any disappointment, she brings so much joy to my life and I just want to help her as best as I can to prepare her for adolescence and adulthood.   I would like to have some input from anyone who may\n be able to advise on whether or not it sounds like SM, and how I should help her in the meantime before we have some professional help.  Thank you to anyone who made it this far!", "What to say when I go in for work on the first day? I posted this in /r/socialskills but I thought you guys might be able to help too and understand why its such an issue.This might be a stupid question, but what is a normal thing to say when I get there? I start working at McDonalds tomorrow. Do I just say something like \"I am supposed to start working here today\" to whoevers at the counter? I have not been shown how to do anything or given a uniform so I cannot just like start working. Also does it matter what I wear if I have not been given a uniform yet (I will probably get it tomorrow)?", "Pretty much ", "Why I am going mute (talking only when needed) for now, instead of trying to talk Basically, I am going mute cause I hate being submissive. In 10th grade, I had focused on talking soo much, anything that involved talking was a \"step in the right direction\" for me. And it honestly was, but it also made me highly submissive in my behavior. Everything I said was some type of joke meant to make other people laugh, or to get them to like me, and if I did not get a good reaction I would feel like shit. The thing is, I did gain \"friends\". They probably saw that I was being submissive, and also that I did not know it. Some of them liked my submissiveness, and no one called it out, I guess cause they thought I would cry or something (which is not true, it would have been way better if they had respectfully called out my submissiveness). So because no one called it out, I mostly had no idea I was being so submissive in 10th grade until the summer of 11th grade (I spent 11th grade completely online).\n\nAfter my first week of senior year, even knowing I should not be submissive anymore, it does not just go away.\n\nFor me, having the mindset of not being submissive is not enough to stop it. I wrote down every submissive action that I could remember doing for the day. I do not really try to make jokes or do the shit I did in 10th grade, but if I answered a question from a teacher and got a dull reaction, I feel bad even though I know it should not matter at all.\n\nSo I am just going to go mute and work on eliminating the submissiveness. I *could* work on that while trying to talk, but when I talk it is almost always going to come out as submissive in some way. It is not even that I am trying to hide it from people, everyone knew I was submissive in 10th. I just get frustrated and it feels like I am taking steps backwards when I say something submissive. I am still capable of doing group work and presentations and such, and I will use them as a tool to see where I am at.\n\nAlso, I do not hate myself. At all. Might be confusing if you were going to give tips. There is another part to this that is very important, but that is for my next post. I am diagnosed with SM. If you are doing this by choice, it is not SM In 9th grade and below, I was the definition of SM at school, and I have already been diagnosed.\n\nIn 10th grade I was still highly anxious but I forced myself to talk little by little, and felt kind of accomplished every time I talked. However I was submissive the whole time.\n\nIt is more of a transition from \\*pushing through the anxiety and trying to talk as much as possible\\* to \\*going mute and trying to fight submissiveness so I can actually be more normal\\* The \u201csubmissiveness\u201d you talked about honestly really just sounds like social anxiety. Which is common alongside SM considering SM is a social anxiety disorder. The only way to really work on that is to speak more and slowly expose yourself to more social situations. You will learn as you go on. Isolating yourself and purposely going mute is not the answer. Isolation will make social anxiety much much worse. My own SM has actually relapsed due to involuntary isolation before, and I have a couple friends who started out voluntarily mute and were not able to start speaking again even when they wanted to and became stuck. I think that not talking means that you cannot speak up for yourself. And that is going to lead to people taking advantage of you and assuming you are ok with whatever they are doing. I do not think this is the way to get what you want. Ill speak when I need to.", "I have been wondering if Andy Warhol and/or Isaac Newton had issues with Selective Mutism. Any thoughts?  What makes you think that?  Well they kind of fit the bill. It is entirely possible that they were just extremely shy and/or antisocial and it has nothing to do with SM.\n\nIf you watch interviews with Andy he always whispers almost inaudibly. In one of his first talk show interviews he attended with his friend, Edie Sedgwick, and upon entering the interview Edie explained that Andy has some communication problems and asked if it was alright if she did all the talking. The interviewer asked what if I want Andy\u2019s opinion and Edie said \u201cAndy will whisper his answers to me and then I will answer for him\u201d halfway through the interview Andy became comfortable enough to answer himself in his barely audible whispers but usually just one word answers. As for Sir Isaac Newton, it is said that he did not like to leave his place and he did not like to socialize. And it is rumored with both of the men that they died virgins because they were so peculiar. Like I said it is obviously possible they were both just very antisocial but I would love to know if there was any time in there lives where they could not speak in certain places or to certain people or any other SM traits. I am a huge nerd for both of them. I dunno much about either of them but the interview description does sound familiar. I would like to see the interview you described if you can find it. I have heard of speculation about newton possibly being aspie too. ", "My best friend used to be mute before I met him. And now he is messaged me that he thinks he feels the need to again. How can I support him? My friend was mute from age 11-14 and then when he entered high school he slowly changed and started talking. I only knew him since he is been talking. But last night he messaged me about how he is feeling like he needs to go mute again. He felt bad because he said that he feels like he is choosing it even though HOH people have to be mute usually and how autistic people have bouts of/are non verbal. I tried to reassure him that he was not being selfish for it, and that if he thought going mute again would help, then I fully support him.\n\nI just do not know how to support him? I do not really know much on the subject, so I thought I would come here and ask you all what would be best? I know not to force him to talk/get mad when he does not talk. I also offered to go out with him wherever he may be going (grocery store, laundromat, etc) so I can talk to people for him- but I do not know if this came across as patronizing? He has not read my message yet because he is still sleeping. \n\nBut yeah- any sorta advice on how I can best support him would be very appreciated &lt;3 Idk if I beat SM, I would not want to revert like that. I think that would be a big mistake in the long run. I am not going to say I am heavily motivated rn to continue trying to speak, but I know me now vs where I was just a few weeks ago (heavily). Progress was much much greater. I agree that regressing back into being mute is probably a step back for his recovery, but I do not really have much of a say in what he does. So I am just trying my best to support him in this until he feels comfortable enough to start speaking again /nm You are a good friend, first and foremost. Your compassionate approach to this kind of situation is more helpful than not, even if his reverting may not be for the best. Please just keep being you and being there for him in whatever he is going through. Dont push, dont criticize, dont play the tough love card, and most importantly, dont take anything personally. I know I would probably be in a better place if I had more understanding/supportive people in my life like you. I ordered him a pack of notepads and a new hello kitty pen bc he said that he will likely be communicating via notepad + basic ASL. (He loves hello kitty hence the hello kitty pen). And I plan on learning some basic ASL (to the best of my ability) so I can better understand him :\u201d\u2022) and I am glad to hear you think I am doing the right thing. I am so new to all of this so I am just wanting to make sure he knows he is loved and cared for- regardless of how he communicates ASL is a great idea! Not only will you be able to continue communicating a little more easily, but you will get to learn something new and useful! I have always thought about this for myself but I do not know a single person who I could employ it with or anyone who would bother learning for me. The Hello Kitty pens and notebook are a nice touch, I think that will mean a lot to him :) I have noticed that during the pandemic I have slipped into being mute again and relying heavily on being non verbal. You are doing a great job being patient and understanding with your friend. Has he told you why he needs to go mute again? He has not explained fully- though I think a lot has to do with some big changes in his family/ the addition of many stressors", "My Teacher Read My Conversation I communicate with my friend at school by giving written papers to him, and this method has been working out well.\n\nI do not know why but I guess some teachers get suspicious about this? \n\nMy teacher asked me and my friend why we were passing notes, and then asked to see it.\n\nShe then gave it back and we tried to continue chatting again, but she stood next to my table while I was writing. When I finished writing, she asked to see the paper again, and read it once more.\n\nShe knows I cannot talk by the way, and she knows I always talk to him like this.\n\nBy the way, this is not a situation where the class has to stay quiet, everyone else was talking to eachother.\nWe were not learning anything because this was a few minutes before a test, so it was like a free period to study/do whatever you want.\n\nHonestly, I think this is an invasion of privacy because it is kind of like reading someone else's text messages.\n\nAdditional story: I remember one time there was a substitute teacher in my class, and she was not teaching. So, everyone was just chilling and I had a conversation with my friend. She then asked for the paper we were writing on and took it completely ): I am sorry that happened to you, it really is not ok.\n\nCould you maybe that that story to your parents or anyone at school that might help? Your teacher clearly overstepped a boundary and it is not ok. I am not even a little bit surprised that this happened. When I was growing up, so many of my teachers seemed to take my not talking personally??? It made no fucking sense, but it led them to overstepping many boundaries. Even my coping mechanisms seemed to piss them off. This is how I would handle the situation if it were me. \n\nWrite a note to the teacher explaining why you were writing notes, what writing notes means to you. Tell her that you felt like she was invading your privacy and you were being treated differently than your classmates. If she does not listen or retaliates in some way, take the problem to the school. Well, while the sub in your second example *was* likely being overbearing, you said the first teacher was reading those **before a test** \\- she wanted to make sure you were not cheating in any way. Except that other students were talking before the test, and this is the way somebody with SM talks. A teacher seeing a student with SM passing a note should just mentally file that as them chatting. Listen, I am 37. I am a critical care nurse manager on leave for ptsd. Private message me\nAnd let her to talk to me. I did not start talking til I was 8 because my step grandfather molested me. My mother literally just beat me up in front of my kids. She can check my post history for reference. I LOVE THAT YOU HAVE A MESSENGER AT SCHOOL. \n\nI only had my sister and we were 18 months apart. I was lucky when I saw her between classes and this is how we could communicate if I happened to see her across the gym if there was an assembly. It was sign language for I love you \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffb\n\nAnd I love you. You go to your guidance counselor, your parent, your guardian with this message: someone has your back, and someone irl better start stepping up. Yes! That is some aspirational thinking, I think. I would love if teachers understood a lot of things about SM and autism when I was in school, that they still probably do not. Ask your favorite teacher or just a cooler one (or ask a friend to for you) what their first thought is when they see pre-test note-passing, and report back. I would love to hear, even if I am wrong.", "Why is my anxiety so bad around one side of the family than the other - How to overcome this?

Older brothers are home cuz they had to sell their house / moved out. I struggle speaking to them still", "things i hate about having selective mutism. i originally wrote this for myself as these things have been so heavy on my mind lately, but i figured this community might relate to my experiences, so i am sharing it here :)\n\n1. i have so much to say but i cannot say it. like, i have met a handful of my favorite bands in the past and i could not say a word to them. they each mean so much to me and i wish i could have told them that and thanked them for everything. i am also seeing my very favorite band in a week or two and on the crazy off chance that i meet their frontman (my hero, my favorite person) i know i will not be able to say anything and that tears me apart. i want to thank him for everything. i want to ask him for a hug :(\n\n2. not being able to do simple things. it is little dumb things, like buying something at a store by myself, or being able to do super casual small talk with strangers, like a \"good morning\" or a \"hi.\" i would also like to make phone calls myself, even though i absolutely hate it. i would like to order my own food at a restaurant, or introduce myself MYSELF. personally, my mom is my voice for everything and i am insanely grateful for that, but sometimes i just want to be ME for once.\n\n3. being treated like a child, or like i cannot understand what someone is saying to me on the occasion they talk to me. yes, i look younger than i am and yes, i do not speak and i can understand why talking to me in a baby voice or using weird hand gestures makes sense to you, but GOD. please do not do it. i already feel plenty infantile as it is. \n\n4. existing but not really. i will be in a room with people and very rarely does anyone talk directly to me. it is always third person, and i get that (why talk to me if i am not going to talk to you) but it hurts so bad. it makes me feel extra lonely. it also makes me get extra attached to people whenever they talk to me or are a sliver of nice. like, one time i was having an extra bad mental day and a family friend came into my room and asked me if i was okay. asked ME if i was okay. and it was genuine :')\n\n5. being reminded i have it. for example, whenever i go somewhere around people or someone new comes around, my mom is the one who introduces me and she is like, \"this is my daughter, she has selective mutism, the only person she talks to is me.\" i am not mad at her for that and i completely get it. i know her, i know she is trying to save me from extra anxiety, and i know it is kind of necessary. but hearing it just sucks. \n\n6. people acting like i am faking it. this has been happening for as long as i can remember, and more than anything, it is incredibly frustrating. WHY would i fake this, especially when i was a little kid? do not you think after being like this for over a DECADE, it is kind of obvious that it is real? i do not think the average kid would be resilient enough to maintain an act like that for so long. and what really sucks about this is it is always been my family accusing me of faking it, and i cannot defend myself. \n\n7. i am scared i will not be able to speak to my best friend if/whenever we meet. yeah, this one is pretty specific, but it is such an important one to me. if i cannot speak to him, it will hurt me so fucking bad. i know he will get it, but i do not want to be voiceless with him :(\n\n8. i am so behind. i need a job. i need to do normal life things. it is just so out of reach. more than just selective mutism has contributed to that, but SM is definitely a huge factor. \n\n9. i do not really hate this one, but i can talk in my dreams. the people i talk to are always my best friend or members of my favorite bands, just people that mean the world to me. those dreams always make me so happy, but they are also a reminder of what i do not have in real life. got to love the subconscious. \n\n10. simply, it makes me feel so sad and stuck and lonely and tired =/\n\nthat is all i can think of at the moment. hopefully this resonates with you guys &lt;3 I totally feel you! It is ecpesially hard if you are a grown man\u2026i am not saying you dont struggle etc. But atleast where i am from it is shuch a \u00abmasculine\u00bb culture, the man has to provide, keep other family members safe etc. lately i cant even go outside my house\u2026 I related to some of this.\n\nI hate even being reminded of sm.  I have overcome muteness, so now I am just shy/ socially awkward with people I do not feel comfortable around.  I can only answer one word answers to the grandmother that did not raise me lmfao. I hate being called or reminded that I am quiet, I do not want to be and do not think the real me under my disorder is quiet and shy!  The things I want to say get locked up in my throat, sometimes it is good instead of spitting bul****t and having resistance, but still.

You owe it to yourself to seek happiness.", "My Selective Mutism Journey I came to this subreddit a while back with the intention of sharing my story. For whatever reason, I never got around to it. My intention was to inspire and encourage others struggling with SM. I guess it was important to lurk for a bit to get a feel for what others are going through. I wanted my words to be the right words...to not call attention to myself or to alienate others in any way. This is my success story...not to flaunt my successes, but to let someone know that success is possible.\n\nI do not really remember how it started. I remember that as a kid, my mom stayed home and babysat a bunch of kids. I had no issues communicating then. I had plenty of friends, and I spoke to them all. I spoke to my family. I spoke to people at church. Then, somewhere along the way, I stopped. It was some time around starting preschool. I spoke to my parents, to my grandparents, a couple of cousins, aunts, and uncles, and a whole two friends at preschool. That is it. I do not remember it starting. There was no specific trigger (at least, not to my four-year-old mind), I just did not want to talk. \n\nMy parents were concerned, obviously. At first everyone thought I was shy. But as the months went on, I still did not speak. My \"list\" of people I would speak to capped itself out at around ten people. Eventually, I even stopped talking to those two friends from preschool (we ended up going to school together all the way through high school). \n\nMy parents took me to a psychiatrist. Eventually they diagnosed me with SM and put me on medication. I remember being asked on multiple occasions if anyone had ever \"touched\" me or told me they would hurt me or my family if I spoke. I knew that was not the case, but it felt like nobody believed me. It did not make sense that I would just randomly stop talking. \n\nEventually I accepted my SM as part of my identity. As I got older, I recognized how thinking about speaking to people gave me crippling anxiety, so it was easier to just roll with it. I figured out other ways of communicating. My teachers wanted to hold me back at one point, but fortunately my parents refused and I was able to stay with my same class. I did very well in school. The teachers were mostly understanding and figured out ways for me to participate without speaking. I always had straight A's. I had tons of friends - I fit in with most of your stereotypical \"cliques.\" My closest friends even came up with our own form of sign language and would translate for me so I did not have to write notes all the time. Looking back, I definitely took my friends for granted. \n\nBy the time I got to 3rd grade, my parents and teachers were working together to figure out how to handle oral presentations. They decided I should videotape myself giving my presentations at home and play them at school. I was traumatized. Eventually, I gave in, but I left the classroom when the first few tapes were played. When I came back in, heart pounding, everyone was actually really nice about it. Most people just carried on as usual, not making a huge deal like I feared. Those who did say something made comments like \"I really like your voice!\" or \"You did great!\" and other mostly encouraging words. Again, totally took my classmates for granted then.\n\nThis pattern carried on until 8th grade. I graduated middle school second in my class. I was supposed to give a speech at graduation, but they did not make me. \n\nI was terrified of high school. New people, new teachers, new environment, new everything. All of my friends were there, of course, but everyone kind of went their separate ways. I started out freshman year just like every other year: refusing to speak but desperate not to attract too much attention for it. Just as I expected, it was much more difficult. People who had not known me for years were much more critical and cruel. Making new friends was difficult. Teachers were much less willing to cater to me. I was struggling. \n\nMy parents were afraid that my SM would hold me back, and I would regret not pushing myself to break through as I got older. They started to get more pushy with challenging me to speak to people. They would orchestrate encounters to coax me to speak. We all knew deep down, though, that it had to be my decision. \n\nIt was not an easy one.\n\nAround my birthday January of freshman year, I had a friend over. I usually had several over, but this time it was just one - one of my closest friends. My parents wanted me to speak to him, and for the first time I truly wanted to as well. They had given his mom a heads-up beforehand, and had spoken with him earlier that evening as well. We went to my bedroom and sat for a minute, and I was very obviously anxious. He looked at me and said \"It is alright, man. You are okay.\" Apparently that moment of understanding and kindness was just enough to crack the surface, because immediately I was able to blurt out (in a tearful whisper) \"I know.\" \n\nSuper anticlimactic for my first words, but that was my breakthrough. I was shocked. After those two short words, I found myself having full conversations with him the rest of the night. It felt so liberating - such intense euphoria. But I still was not \"cured.\" I could only speak to that one friend. \n\nOver the course of the next semester, I started choosing one-by-one new friends to speak to for the first time. In hindsight, this progression happened pretty quickly. I added 5 or 6 friends to that list over a few months. Then, my parents challenged me to take a bigger step - speak to a whole group of people. \n\nWe had an overnight event with the youth group at church (they were like my extended family). I chose this group and this event as my next leap. Again, this was all orchestrated by my parents, so everyone was prepared. We all got into a big circle, and after the youth pastor explained what was going on, I spoke the first words (word) in front of a big group...\"Hey.\" \n\nJust like before, I was able to slowly move towards full conversations with everyone by the end of the night. I was initially incredibly anxious, but after that first intentional word, the weight was lifted off. I moved forward by adding groups at a time now, starting with a couple of classes at school. The more people I spoke to, the easier it got.\n\nFast forward to sophomore year, I gave myself my own challenge - proceed as if SM was never a thing. It was frightening, but after the first few classes and answering \"Here\" during attendance, I was able to nonchalantly dodge the shocked responses from my peers and move forward with the new school year. \n\nIt took a bit, but I eventually applied this to the rest of my interactions - ordering for myself at restaurants, carrying on full-volume conversations in public, etc. \n\nThen, my best friend was killed in a car accident. I was crushed. I was asked to speak at his funeral at our church. I did not even hesitate. A few days later, I found myself giving my first public speech in front of several hundred people. People without SM even struggle with public speaking, so you can imagine the anxiety involved here.\n\nContinuing through school, I began to thrive. I got involved with FBLA and eventually became president of our chapter. I competed in Business Plan, presenting with my team in front of panels of judges until we placed 5th nationally my senior year. I graduated as salutatorian and gave my speech in front of an enormous crowd at graduation.\n\nI went on to college, pushed through my residual social anxiety and joined a fraternity. After easing my way in, I worked my way onto the executive board and eventually became chapter president. I graduated college with honors and moved on to my career as an accountant.\n\nThree years later, I am 25, married, preparing to close on our brand new house, excelling in my career as a Senior Financial Analyst, actively involved in our church, and even slowly building a small accounting practice of my own. \n\nAgain, I am not listing off my successes to brag. I just want others to know that a boy who struggled with SM for 14 years once made a conscious decision to speak. It was the hardest choice I ever made, and leading up to that first moment I felt like dying would be lest painful and less frightening. It took a supportive family and friend group, a single understanding friend, and a ton of willpower to make it through. But you can make it through. It starts with your choice to no longer be confined by your SM. It will not be easy, but as someone who is been where you are, believe me. It is so worth it. You have got this.\n\nThe SM is still there. I still find it crippling to start conversations at large gatherings. I sometimes cannot make myself speak up in large meetings. My anxiety has returned, and on bad days I find it difficult to muster up the willpower to even speak a sentence to my amazing wife. I still struggle, and I am still growing. But I no longer consider my SM my identity. It is just a nagging obstacle that I am proud to have overcome. Hopefully you can overcome it, too. S/O to u/Multisensory for inspiring me to share my own story. You are so fortunate for having friends/family that pushed you in the right direction...\n\nHere I am, older, robbed of life, and awaiting the day it is all over. &gt;I agree, I am incredibly blessed to have grown up with that kind of support group. As far as your situation goes, I am not going to pretend that I know exactly what you are going through...all of us have a unique story, and I am sure we all cope with the anxiety in our own ways. What I did learn from my journey, though, is that  \n1. It is not impossible. You CAN push through that wall.  \n2. Your SM does not define you. You can communicate and you can be successful.  \n3. You are not alone. You may not have family and friends that support and encourage you, but there are people who have been where you have been, and we want you to succeed. We are fortunate enough to have the technology to connect us with people who can change our lives without being limited by our own anxieties and insecurities. You just have to be willing to open up.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I truly hope you can find the strength to keep trying. I do not know you. I do not know your story. But I know that it is up to you to acknowledge your own worth and give yourself the credit you deserve. It is never too late, and you have people rooting for you, even if you cannot hear them. You do not have to let SM rule your life. Thanks for posting this. It gave me a little hope, even though I am not sure I could do it myself.\n\nI do have one question, though. Do you think you would have been able to talk to that one friend out of the blue? Like, without him knowing you wanted to? I feel like it is hard to suddenly start talking when people do not expect you to. It is hard to say now, but I am pretty sure I would not have been able to. There was definitely a point where I wanted to talk to my friends, and I guess it finally made it to where that desire was stronger than the anxiety. I believe that him knowing that I wanted to talk to him, and him being chill and understanding about it kind of reduced that anxiety enough to tip the balance to that point. I guess that is the best analogy I can come up with. Without him knowing, I probably would have stressed too much over finding the perfect time and place to try to say that first word, only for that perfect scenario to never occur, or for me to miss my opportunity and cause more anxiety. Anxiety is an irrational beast, so taking all of those steps to provide enough constants left my anxiety with less variables to overthink. \n\nI am not saying that is the perfect solution for everyone, but I think for me, planning it out and making him aware gave me the opportunity to disregard everything and just focus on how much o wanted to be \"normal.\" So no, I do not believe I would have (at that point, anyway) have been able to speak to him if he was not expecting it. This really brought a tear to my eye. Thanks for sharing, op. I am sure this helped a lot of people Thank you. It feels great to put my story out there. I truly hope someone can find hope from my story. I am crying. Thank you so much for your story. I am truly happy that you were able to overcome your SM, this is an absolutely amazing story!! Thank you! It is been 10 years since I spoke those first words, and for some reason I have pushed those memories behind me. I guess I was ashamed. But now I am compelled to share, because maybe I can help someone find the strength to make their own breakthrough. I am 17 and I have it SM but no one really knows.+(also Terrible anxiety and depression, caused by nmy shit parents long story). I am not shy at all but have no confidence anymore and I am scared to talk to ppl I do not know well. it happens Alot when I am stressed which is everyday but I was on vacation without my dad for a week am by day 7 of the trip I was almost able to talk normally not nervous at all.  My SM is the worst around my dad, and he does not even know what SM is and I will Try to speak and I am not able to and he will ask me to repeat myself then I will just ignore him while be ask me what I said. I can talk kind of good around friends no one knows I have it , sometimes I get stuck trying to say a word but I just use a different word or sentence and it works fine most of the time. But I cannot talk on the phone or order fast food at the drive through at all I have tried and i just cannot say what I am thinking and I have Tried breathing And slowing down. I am going to move out and once I get away from my dad It should help my SM go away alot Thank you so much for posting this. It was like reading about my son. He has not spoken at school since 1st grade, and struggled with it before that. But he is always had great grades, and all of his teachers and classmates have been amazing with him. He is about to finish up 6th grade now, and he still does not speak to anyone from school. Maybe I will encourage him to plan with his best friend a day for him to try to say something to her.\n\nThank you again. Your story has given me more hope at a time when I am feeling frustrated and like I am failing to help my child. Based on how you are speaking in this response, I am confident that you are not failing your son. I often think back and try to imagine how my parents felt throughout my time in school. I wonder if they blamed themselves in any way...I know for a fact that they felt helpless and probably frustrated just like you. Maybe I will have that conversation with them soon. \nI have so many thoughts I could share right now, but for the sake of brevity, I will just say this: continue to encourage your son. Let him know that you understand how difficult it is. He already feels alienated at times, I am sure. Let him know that you believe in him, and that when he is ready to step out of his comfort zone, you are on his side. And to that point, when that time comes, make sure to eliminate every stressor you can think of. In that moment, the anxiety is so unbelievably intense, any additional stress can derail your progress. And make sure that you push him. Slowly and gently, but give him opportunities to step outside of his comfort zone a little bit at a time. It takes those baby steps to move forward. It takes a lot of patience, but do not lose hope and do not be too hard on yourself as a parent. I am glad my story could give you hope - that is why I want to share. If you have any questions about my story, feel free to reach out. And if you have any questions as a parent, my mom would probably love to share her perspective. All I can say is thank you so much. You have already helped more than you can possibly know. \nI told my son about your story, focusing on how you decided you were ready and planned ahead with your family and friend to speak to him. He said he really wants to talk to his best friend before the school year ends (that is less than a month now!), and that planning it ahead with her sounds like it might be easier. So he is going to plan with her a time this next month when he can try to talk to her and her know it is coming so she does not react too big. I am so proud of him ask the time, but I am glad he was already planning to try to talk to her sooner rather than later.\nThank you again for sharing your story and for your kind words. This is great to hear! Please keep me posted. For what it is worth I am rooting for him. I will! Thank you! \ud83d\ude01 Thank you so much for posting this. I literally just discovered that the behaviour i have is selective mutism and i have been struggling with it for more than a decade, constantly crying over wondering why i cant just be normal and have friends without weirding them out with my sudden silences. \n\nI couldnt sleep over sadness from what i am and stumbled upon this post at 3am made me cry my heart out. With your story there is still hope. Thank you. There is definitely still hope! I cannot imagine how it must feel to have struggled for a decade without a clear answer as to what is even happening. It must feel a little better knowing you are not alone, though. I am glad you could find some sort of comfort and strength from my story - that is why it is here! Hey! I promised to keep you updated, so here it is:\n\nThe school year is done now. My son did not manage to talk to his bestie this last month. I think at least partly because, it turns out, she is moving to the other side of town and will not be going to the same school as him anymore. She does not have or want a cell phone, does not have an email or, apparently, use the computer much at all. So they will lose contact for the foreseeable future.\n\nMy son did exchange numbers with a couple of his other friends, though, so they can text throughout the summer. So, while he has not vocally spoken to any of his school friends yet, he is trying to be more social. That is a win in my book! \n\nThank you again for your support! I hope you are doing well. Thank you for the update! I have been wondering. I am sorry that it did not work out, but what matters is that he expressed the desire to speak, and like you said, he is taking steps towards being more social. Learning to have conversations in any capacity will likely relieve a lot of anxiety going forward. Hope you are doing well yourself!", "Questions for those who did not get suficicient help. (Ever) Currently, I can only speak to my direct family. I am not yet old enough to get a job, so I am hoping I will build up the Confidence to simply be able to speak to the people there, have any of you done this, could you?  I am a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n-  (\n\n&amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and do not vote in the other threads.) ^\\((/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^(/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* It could work but how would you build confidence? It probably means stepping outside your comfort zone such as participating in meetup activities for example and depending on your experience it might indeed increase confidence (like if everyone is friendly/positive and therefore giving you a positive feedback loop) or destroy it (like if someone decides to pick on you because you are quiet). IMO therapy is more effective and quicker to build that confidence because part of it is going to the root of the issue (what are factors triggering SM) and learning coping mechanisms. Trying to build confidence DIY style is kind of like building it on a wobbly foundation... I have had therapy, but it just was not working. I could not connect, because I could not speak to them.  You are right about that, it definitely has to do with anxiety and fear of judgement from others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry to hear about what happened in therapy. maybe it could click better with someone else ? A good therapist will not judge you. They are here to help and have seen it all before. there is also a few options for online therapy so maybe it makes things easier to find someone more compatible. Maybe practice a few times discussing out loud topics you want to discuss with the therapist before the appointment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm i totally get you about the persona thing. There was a thread on here where someone was able to overcome part of their SM when they switched school and basically started fresh because they did not feel burdened by their their former SM label.\n\nSomething really weird I noticed is that my SM is prevalent when I have to speak in my native tongue. But when I speak foreign languages it is like I am a different person: confident and spontaneous because i do not have that anxiety and baggage associated with my native tongue. It also does not matter if i make a mistake per say because i am learning. At one point, I was also part of a social anxiety group, and it felt so comfortable being with people who go through the exact same thing and understand what it is like. It also helped practice small talk and suff and everyone over there were eager to make friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, the important thing is that here you are being proactive about wanting to change things\n\n&amp;#x200B; Unfortunately, I do not think I will be able to change school, and when I go into a higher school, there will definitely be some from the previous holding me back. Especially since I want to go to sixth form in my current one, it is the same surroundings, same teachers, I do not like change.\n\nSo, my next hope is to be able to when I get a job, when its probably most important.  Try some form of therapy with some medication. Trust me, the longer you wait, the harder it will be to get better. \n\nAsk your parents to make you an appointment.  Maybe text them if telling them face to face makes you too uncomfortable.  I suffered from Selective Mutism from when I was 3 years old until approximately 14. I also found that therapy did not help at all, since you are expected to talk, which I did not. It just created more pressure and made me feel even more trapped inside myself.\nIn the end I was sent to a psychiatrist, who focused on me improving and progressing on my own, being in control of my own progress and actions. What helped me was that she understood that it was not that I did not want to talk, it was because I felt that I could not. \nWe had sessions every 6 months approximately, where she would only congratulate me on my progress and she would not pressure me. The set task was to print off a weekly calendar and set tiny goals for each day of the week. It was extremely important to be realistic when setting the goals. For example, on one day of the first week I would say \"Thank you\" in a shop, which was a huge deal. Next day I would say \"Could I have a plastic bag, please?\", or even repeat the same goals for a few days to gain confidence.\nAt first I started doing these things in places where no one would know me so it was much easier. Then month by month I would make these tasks a little more challenging, though by this point I had gained more confidence. \nI truly hope this helps. If you have any questions you can PM me. I also felt pressured, it was like she was forcing me each time to get me to talk to her, when she realised that it was not that easy, they just gave up on me. But for me, I find it weird to even do things like that, did you feel the same?  Yes, it was very difficult for me to do things that would seem silly to other people. Even clapping. I felt like I did not want to attract any attention. My major worry was the OMG WHY ARE YOU TALKING face from people at school. I started doing these mini challenges in places where no one knew me at all. After a couple of years i started to talk at school. Turns out no one cared at all. \nI feel like after so many years of not talking its easier just not to talk because you do not want to make a scene and attract any attention. \nMaybe set a daily goal and tell your direct family your plan. They will probably encourage you and then it would not be such a shock for them. I think the key is to do it step by step, because if you leave it for a certain moment you will have already created expectations and you will be more anxious. \nIt is very late and I ended up typing a very long life story haha. If you want a shortened answer just read the last paragraph.\n\n\nI have had selective mutism since I was born and I am now 15. I never have been treated for it, unless you count some school counselors attempts to make me talk, which did not work by the way, so every bit if progress I made was on my own. My selective mutism was probably at it is worst from when I started kindergarten to about 3rd or 4th grade. I only spoke at home, and was just literally mute at school. If I was asked a question all I could do was stand there and stare, I could not make myself speak. I also was mute to a few of my family members. (not my immediate family, like my mom dad and siblings) In fact the only family members I both spoke to and were comfortable around were my immediate family and my grandmother on my moms side. Although I started talking to several family members like aunts uncles and cousins there are still a pretty good amount of family members I still have not spoken to to this day. Anyway, I was yelled at several times by school faculty over my elementary school years which only made my anxiety worse. Even if I had therapy at the time it probably would not have worked as I would be too scared to talk. So I just kept going through school like that, although teachers would try to get me to talk every once in a while, some giving me long talks and some even giving me small threats, they just knew that I did not and that I would not. The students also knew and usually left me alone. Surprisingly though, I did have more than one friend at a time during school, even during the years it was at it is worst, idk how because I did not talk to them. I was completely mute during school up until 4th grade when one teacher wanted me to do the reading during one of those group reading things, she threatened me with silent lunch if I did not read and I do not know why that worked because 1 it is not like teachers have not threatened me before and 2 silent lunch? she was going to give me silent lunch for NOT talking? lol idk i guess she just scared me. That is when I started talking in school but only when teachers asked a question. If not I stayed silent and still did not talk to my friends. Then I moved schools during grade 4 and it started to get even better. I was really timid and shy when I first moved because if the anxiety but I did talk at that new school, I basically thought I might as well talk because they do not know who I am and I guess that worked. I made friends in school and also at the apartment complex I lived in. Although I was pretty shy I did talk to them and it was actually the best time period if my life so far. I moved again in 5th grade and while of course I was nervous the mutism and anxiety had just gotten better, I do not know if I had just gotten used to it or what but as I said I had no therapy or help of any kind. From that grade to today I have continued to talk in school if I have to. While it is gotten better I would not say it is completely gone since I am still mute to some family members because I was back when it was bad. Both the selective mutism and social anxiety have improved so much since kindergarten and I am honestly proud if myself for doing it all on my own. \n\n\n\n\nLong story short, I definitely think you can overcome if without sufficient help. I would say mine was very severe, when I started school it was horrible not being able to talk, and the anxiety was so bad that I was too nervous to do simple things like eat in the cafeteria and I broke down crying one day because I just could not eat in front of everybody. How fast you progress depends on you and the situations you are in. I definitely think mine could be better or worse right now, and I am hoping I will continue to get better. However aside from those few family members I said I do not speak to, I am no longer mute in school and speak to all new strangers I meet and can go into stores alone and can order food in restaurants by myself. It is all about you and I know this post was a while ago but I hope you are doing better. I also used to be afraid to eat, so I had to save my lunch until after school.\n\nIt took me six years to be able to do it. I had to do it with one teacher, then teacher and a friend, 2 friends etc.. Until I had confidence to eat in the cafeteria, on our own table in the corner.\n\nBut the problem with speaking is I do not know where to start, with who or how I am supposed to be able to do it.  I wish I could help you to begin speaking, but honestly I do not have advice for it as I was forced into it. However when I started speaking to some family members it was literally just me being terrified and then just speaking. I do not know what made me want to talk but after it was very relieving. That probably will not help but I hope the best!", "Have you been told this before? \u201cI will not talk to you if all you are going to do is apologize for everything!\u201d\n\nHow did you react to being told this? I have been told some versions of this and it just makes me go quieter because I am afraid I will apologize again on accident.

Hi, so this happened about 5-4 years ago I cannot really remember but and I was around 7-11 not really sure to be honest.\n\nSo basically I went to my friends house as it was her birthday my other friends were invited too and everything was going perfect until we played this game.. guess what is in the bag. To me this was awful as I hate talking especially in front on 10+ people. Anyway it came to my turn and put my hand in the bag and knew what it was, it was a pencil and I could not say anything and my friends were trying to help me as they were very caring but my friends mum and dad was just watching me, not trying to help not even giving me something to write or anything. Just staring at me for like 4 minutes straight and I was so anxious it was awful. They felt intimidating and scary, they wanted me to talk but I would not and they knew me for a few years prior this so they knew I have selective mutism.\nLooking back at this is was awful, they were not caring at all and just wanted for me to speak. They knew what they were doing and I hated it! \n\nI saw them once and they did not bother speaking to me, they did not even acknowledge I was there but they knew who I was. They knew they did wrong.\n\nThough this happened 4-5 years ago it really made my selective mutism worser and I do not trust many people anymore.\nThe moral of this is that if someone wants you to talk you NEVER have to!\nIf someone is forcing you remember you NEVER have to!\nYou NEVER have to do anything you do not want to! im sorry u had to go through that ;-; textbook response It is ok, I am glad I do not have any contact with them anymore :d ? What is a text book response Overused. woah that is nice then B) well it is the safest thing to say, idk why u mad not mad just giving information I had a group of friends online call me pathetic for not joining a voice call with them and then told me to not talk to them again, they left the conversation with me. The next day they messaged me again, belittled me and then waited. I did not respond. And then they said they were not mad anymore but never apologized to me so they just went around on a total victim card and acted like I was so bad for ghosting them. Never ever speak to people who undermine your comfort for their entertainment. And do not allow them to push you because more often than not, you will end up robbed. Idiots who treat you like shit over something so simple are far more worse with actual issues Yes I totally agree, people like this are just a bunch of assholes. They really do not care and just want entertainment for their own will.  \nI hope you meet better friends who are caring and understand :) thank u for the info, helped me a ton, smooch for u", "I actually spoke in my dreams last night Idk how everyone else dreams, but in the past I have basically never had dreams where I spoke in them, it would be so extraordinarily rare for me to. \n\nIt is still kind of in broken language but I was actually speaking to my little sister, like she was driving with me and she almost crash (since she has a permit), and I said 'Left, left left...' Then later I was like 'let me drive'....I also said more 'I think you need to drive more with Dad'.....And I said 'Eventually you will get good at it though.' \n\nIt was so weird, but I guess another question for those recovered or recovering, did you start to experience dreams in which you talked to those you never did consistently before?  It was so odd because the words just flowed and I was like \"what am I doing???\"...but it just kept coming. It is so abnormal as well. Did you recover from SM? No. I seem to be making more progress understanding my SM rather than solving it. I want to wait and track my improvements, and after a while l'll post.

Want to hear from people who have experience of it? I have taught the child for 2 years now and never had any form of communication from them. The child is bright and capable and consistently top of the class. They are a young teenager now and have had this condition since age 6. They have recently been diagnosed with \"severe autism\" and put on medication. My own experience of twenty years teaching tells me this is not an autitistic child. They do not exhibit any behaviours that I would associate with autism and I have taught a lot of autistic young people. I am concerned they are misdiagnosed. I am concerned the medication is unhelpful for them and I am concerned that despite all the different professionals that have worked with them over the years, nobody has had the expertise to diagnose and treat them correctly. I think the child has a severe social anxiety disorder but not autism. I have had reports from the parents that the child speaks fluently at home and is emotionally developed accordingly with their age, but I have no evidence of that.\n\nCan anyone with experience of the condition shed any light?\n\nThank you.  It is hard to be sure what specifically is going. Social Anxiety, Selective Mutism, and Autism present differently in each person. If the child shuts down in front of specialists it could have lead to a misdiagnosis. \n\nCan the child write? Perhaps you can attempt to open up a form of communication this way? Get a white board or encourage them to share their thoughts on something on paper when at home where they feel safe.\n\nFor me, it feels much like what you described. I have the words, but they are locked away and I cannot get them out. I have found that writing helps me to communicate with others, but personally cannot really do that \"in the moment\" effectively either. \n\nIt takes a lot of patience. I am glad they have specialists involved. \n\n &gt; Can the child write? \n\nYes the child can write and can produce written schoolwork, in all subjects, which is towards the higher level of ability for a child of their age.\n\nBut I have asked the child to communicate with me directly in writing, on a post it note for example, and they never have responded. They only did once and that was a year ago.\n\n&gt; For me, it feels much like what you described. I have the words, but they are locked away and I cannot get them out\n\nI am more and more sure this is what it is. I have observed the child for two years now and there is nothing that suggests autism to me. I can almost feel that it is the same as when I was a child and the words just would not come out. They jibberred and jabbered on the edge of my wobbling lips and would not organise themselves properly whilst I stood there like and embarrassed stuttering bag of nerves. \n\nI feel like this child has the same problem but the words are just stuck further up the pipe. It never even gets to their lips. It never gets as far as showing an emotion. They just freeze. \n\n &gt;They do not exhibit any behaviours that I would associate with autism and I have taught a lot of autistic young people. I am concerned they are misdiagnosed. I am concerned the medication is unhelpful for them and I am concerned that despite all the different professionals that have worked with them over the years, nobody has had the expertise to diagnose and treat them correctly. I think the child has a severe social anxiety disorder but not autism. I have had reports from the parents that the child speaks fluently at home and is emotionally developed accordingly with their age, but I have no evidence of that.\n\nSorry but it is really risky to speculate. Having taught a lot of autistic people does not at all give you the background to make that type of judgement. I do not think this is autism either. When I had selective mutism, I wanted to speak but I just could not. The words were stuck in my throat. I would only write (as a form of communication) to my friends because I felt very comfortable with them. I was very scared of people, maybe try to show the child that you are not just the teacher but a friend too?  I am asked regularly to provide evidence of autism in children, it is part of my job. I am trained to recognise it, have been trained in how to manage it and have 20+ years of experience in having autistic children in the classroom. \n\n I was never diagnosed. My family was neglecting, abusive, so I was never treated for anything despite struggling massively. As an adult, I was able to recognize I actually had selectively mutism growing up. I realized that other people also struggled with speaking to the severe degree that I did and sometimes were treated for it and I also think I could have autism. It was hard to think about and really consider, take seriously because of the huge stigma surrounding the two disorders. Even selective mutism has really negative associations related to it. When I was a teenager I only knew about Maya Angelou and the Virginia Tech shooter. These days there ( ( ( ( ( ( ( But in the end, I had to really take the time to think about it and I decided it does explain a lot of my struggles. I kept running into brick after brick wall back when I avoided thinking about it.\n\nAnd you will actually find a lot of people both in this subreddit and on the autism related ones who believe they have both or have been diagnosed with both. There are even people who believe a lot of non verbal people with autism are non verbal because of unrecognized selective mutism.\n\nThe confusion autism brings in relation to social expectations, rules, etc. can make it really hard for the person to feel comfortable feeling like they are doing the right thing or to know when they are expected to do something and *what* to do and if it is present which I really believe you should assume is, then it plays a huge role in everything.\n\nI really like this video where they set up rules you should live by when you interact with children with SM ( Did you ever \"whisper\" to a friend who you felt comfortable with, and communicate with the teacher that way?\n\nI have had a report from another pupil that once, when the child was very young, they once or twice communicated this way.  Hi, I am a bot (in Beta). I combined your list of YouTube videos into one shareable highlight reel link:  \n\n You can play through the whole highlight reel (with timestamps if they were in the links), or select each video.\n\n Reply with the word ignore and I will not reply to your comments. Are you saying the parents consider him autistic but do not see his lack of speech as indicative of selective mutism? No, I never whispered to a friend. I could not talk to them. I would softly-quietly ask my teachers to use the bathroom though because I had to. I could not say good morning or yes or no or answer anything but I could ask to go to the bathroom. (And made sure no one else could hear me except for the teacher)  No, the parents have not suggested anything. The professional agencies that have been dealing with the child have recently diagnosed autism. Bearing in mind the child has never said a word to any of them for nearly 10 years.\n\nThe child apparently speaks fluently at home although no agency has any evidence of it other than parent's word. \n\nI have one report from another child that says the patient spoke to them in whispers when they were 7 years old, and has not ever since.  &gt; No, I never whispered to a friend. I could not talk to them\n\nWhat did this physically feel like please if you could try to explain it?\n\nDid you hear the words in your head but they did not get communicated to your mouth?\n\nDid you try to speak and it wouldnt come out?\n\nDid you want to speak but felt so nervous about being \"wrong\" that you felt some kind of fear that prevented you?\n\nDid you try really hard to vocalise and was it frustrating that it would not come out?\n\nDid it bother you? Did you think there was something wrong with you and that made it even worse?  Children with autism can be what is typically thought of as smart, which you probably already know. They can seem very normal through that lens since that is where they might be 'at their peak'. It can be the area where they have in some regards have the least difficulties. That being said, he definitely is disabled enough that his education is being severely affected. His communication, really important in autism too, is being severely affected by his silence, so it is a situation that begs to have autism be considered and if they have found others signs of it, it is a situation that begs to have the idea taken seriously. You do not want to underestimate any difficulties they might be struggling with. You can be right and have a child with selective mutism in your hands and at the same time, he can also be an autistic child. Like I said, you will find other people if you use the search bar who have both disorders and have been diagnosed with both. You will also, sadly, find plenty of people who did not have their autism taken seriously because they did not fit certain criteria for what a 'really disabled' person looks like and did not learn to cope with the invisible difficulties until they took it upon themselves to seek that out on their own as full grown adults. I feel like you have an agenda to push as somebody with autism. I am not looking for a discussion about autism, I am convinced this child does not have it. I want to talk to people who have experience of selective mutism. Thank you.  Yeah. My agenda is: it exists. I have selective mutism. I even shared some really useful resources for you on my other comment.\n\nI am just someone who disagrees with you. I do not think you are well equipped to argue against a professional diagnosis when the person in question is not able to communicate anything of substance to you. I know how limited the information you have on him must be because I struggled with selective mutism myself and was not able to basically communicate even the most insignificant things, let alone talk about highly stigmatized mental health conditions I might have had. His or her good school performance is not indicative of a lack of autism. It is an area many autistics can excel in.  You are using the word agenda... I guess because I am bringing up a lot of issues usually only talked about in circles made up exclusively of autistic people. But these are things that are actually very relevant to your life as someone who works with autistic people.   All I am saying is if the child is already diagnosed, accept it. You will not be holding him back by taking his disability into account as long as you are treating him with dignity and still recognize his strengths. Addressing any challenges can only help him. It is an area that very few have any experience in. For what it is worth I was never diagnosed... with anything. My family punished me rather than getting me help. I am in the process of seeking diagnoses, however, and I believe I do have Autism along with Selective Mutism. I did well in school and was \"above average\" in most subjects. Each person is different in how they exhibit symptoms, the specialists may be exactly correct. Autism is kind of an umbrella term that covers a broad spectrum, the areas of struggle are much the same but the presentation of symptoms is diverse. Like I said originally, it is hard to be sure. I think the fact that so many people are advocating for this child is wonderful.  This would really depend on the settings they are in. Kids are usually diagnosed with selective mutism if they only have mutism at school or in public places. If they have progressed and become mute even at home and do not communicate in nonverbal ways either then that is more severe problem.  Have you noticed any sensory problems? Like covering ears, shielding their eyes from light, having headaches, or stimming? (Chewing on their sleeves or hoodie strings, or jewelry, etc)  Teachers input is very important in a mutism diagnosis and autism diagnosis but some signs of autism are more subtle than others especially in highly intelligent children that make an effort to mask it.", "How do i help my girlfriend not relapse into being mute again My girlfriend was mute when she was a kid and has came a long way from it. She is now, extremely talkive and out going, but recently has told me she feels her mind having fewer and fewer words everyday. Last night she told me every day is harder than the last, but is trying to force herself in social situations becuase its suppose to help. But becuase of quarentine she hasnt seen any of her friends in a while and only really talks to me and her mum.\n\n\n\nHow do i help my girlfriend? Any advice is appreciated You guys can read a book together out loud or find a job from home where she is required to speak on the phone Would getting her to read me some stuff out lpud help. Im not very good at reading, but she loves books and told me she will read me whatever i would like. Of course! Thanks for the advice man. I hate to say it because I know this is not what you are hoping for, but therapy. She needs to cope with her emotions. Also just talking to the therapist will help her think in words, because it is someone different. And a therapist will have the best tools for teaching her how to keep talking in general. When I have relapsed it is usually because I stayed inside completely and avoiding talking to anyone at all, then I basically just dug myself into a hole. If your country still allows it, Try going for walks each day, and the suggestion of reading books is perfect. Just try doing small exposure exercises as much as possible. True, but it might not be an available option at this time to receive face to face exposure therapy Exposure therapy does not always have to be talking to people, and I never said it had to be. That is why I suggested going for walks to just get out of your house, where you are fully comfortable. Honestly, face to face exposure is usually way to much to start with anyway, so it is usually recommend that you start by walking around in a parking lot or riding your bike places. That is what I was told to do at first. My therapists always had me do it by talking to people, sorry if I upset you by my reply! I was always told to speak to people and my parents would slowly leave, but it did not work so great and I relapsed again last year and still am trying to get out of it. Not to make it like a randomly input backstory, just relating my experiences with yours is all It depends on how severe your SM is really. If you are more on the severe side it is usually best to stick to smaller exposures rather than immediately jumping into face to face interactions. If you are more mild and can even speak some, you could start at face to face. Now, since face to face is obvious advised against, you would have to try other things to at least do *something*. Honestly now that I think of it, it is probably because before me my therapist did not know what sm even was, he probably winged it, but I was young and I could not actually speak to him until like the 3rd appt and even then he just called it 'shyness'", "Little help? I wanted to make a twitter thread about SM, explaining what it is and how it works and everything because a lot of people who have contact with me do not know what it is, but all I know about SM is my experience and it is not of great help in making an informational thread. \n\nSo I would like to know if anyone could help me.

She stutters once in a while now and talks a lot when she is anxious.

I am 17 and I want to go to therapy for my selective mutism that I have had my whole life (I was diagnosed this year), and I am scared because I do not know what will happen. If anyone has been to therapy for SM as an teen/adult can you please describe what happens during the sessions, especially the first ones? An adult with SM here. I have tried different therapists over the years and the most helpful have been ones that have experience with exposure therapy.  With exposure therapy you are usually slowly exposed to situations that make you anxious, But maybe something different might work for you. Usually during the first few meetings with any therapist they tend ask questions about you or your history. It does get easier the more you repeat the things that make you anxious. Any legitimate therapy will begin with making sure you understand your rights especially around confidentiality and the therapist's responsibilities to you. A therapist will go through things and make sure you understand what you are consenting to. A first session can often be a bit anti-climactic as it can take a while to explain all the consent stuff, but that is actually kind of nice in my experience. \n\nThen there will probably be some basic psychoeducation too. The therapist will explain terms and concepts to you so that you are both on the same page. They might ask you to fill out a standardised measure of anxiety or something similar. These are sometimes used to to get a baseline as well as better understand your problems and possibly track your improvement over time. \n\nOne of the big factors in therapy is making the client comfortable and making sure they understand everything that is going on so they can make informed decisions. From there, you will be making decisions as a team. A therapist is not going to force you to do anything or spring surprises on you. \n\nCBT has good evidence for successfully treating SM and other anxiety conditions. It can often include some exposure therapy too. \n\nBest of luck on your recovery journey! How did you manage to find a therapist that worked for you? Also this is the first time i am hearing about CBT, can you go more in depth as to what that is? If you are in the UK, you can go to your GP, or refer yourself if you are in England through IAPT. Though, that might not be possible since you are under 18 and would be under a different service like CYPMHS. (  (\n\nEither way, your doctor is a good first place to go. You could also ask whoever gave you your diagnosis. \n\nCBT stands for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. It has good scientific backing and is one currently one of the most widely used therapies for anxiety and depression, though it is not the only useful one by any means. The focus is on improving your life going forward rather than delving back into your childhood to understand the origin of problems. It is not the stereotypical lie on a couch and talk about your dreams therapy of years past. \n\nInstead, the focus is on identifying both the cognitions (thoughts and feelings) and behaviours which are causing you distress, working out how they interact and reinforce each other, and finding ways to gently alter them to improve how you respond to situations. \n\nHere is a general guide you might find helpful: ( Most therapists will not take on a patient who does not talk. It is a waste of both your time really.....", "Hi m19 just found out that i have SM ", "Jobs for an SM Teenager ", "SM or am I an idiot ? Righto, ive had this problem for as long as I can remember and I think it was triggered by emotional abuse from my childhood. I do not want to self diagnose but I also feel like it is something I really need to confront or even just understand. I have pretty bad anxiety that is coupled with paranoia and that leads me to not speak or interact with people like a normal human. I find it incredibly difficult to talk to people I am not already comfortable with irl, even to the point where I wont greet people or make any effort to converse with them because my brain and body just completely shut down. \n\nIt is so frustrating because I know that I come across as super weird and quiet but around my close friends I think of myself as a nice open NORMAL person. I hate that this is a part of who I am and it has ruined quite a few friendships with people who think im being an uptight dick when in reality I just physically cannot and will not speak. \n\nAny advice is welcome, something needs to change.  First off: No, you are not an idiot. The way you write makes that obvious. You are just going to have to grips with the fact that you are intelligent.\n.\n.\nThe way you are feeling is completely normal. Selective mutism and social anxiety are common. And titles are not important. Selective mutism and social anxiety are made up names for feelings and behaviors... feelings and behaviors that a lot, a lot, a LOT of us have. Take it from me. I barely spoke to anyone for a few years, I hid in bathrooms, skipped class, skipped work, and basically skipped life for a long time. \n.\n.\nIt is nothing to be embarrassed about. Some people have blue eyes, some have brown. Some people do not have selective mutism, some do. Yes, I know it feels much more serious than that. Eye color does not leave one feeling alienated, weird, and uncomfortable... or in my case, totally horrified.  The point is, it is nothing to be ashamed of. This is who you are. It makes you interesting. No two people are the same. It is okay to be who you are. \n.\n.\n.\nThere are steps that can be taken. If you are like me, a lot your inability to talk in certain situations is tied up in anxiety. I talked to a shrink for a few months and it really helped. \n.\n.\n.\nRemember to breathe. If you find yourself feeling anxious, put your hand on your belly and breathe slowly and deeply.\n.\n.\n.\nRemember that a lot of the pressure you feel is self-imposed. Do not be an \"uptight dick\" to yourself. That is right. Sometimes the person who bullies us most is our self. You would not let someone bully your friends or family, so why would you let you bully you? \n.\n.\n.\nIf you find yourself catastrophizing, remind yourself that the pressure you feel is your own invention. Do not let your inner-narrator convince you that the world is ending. You will keep on living and breathing. Even if you were to never speak again... your life continues, bad days come and go, beautiful things happen.\n.\n.\nBut you will speak again. Become an expert on selective mutism and social anxiety disorder. Do not self-diagnose. You may be both, you may be neither. Talk to a psychologist. If you do not have insurance or money, there are psychologists who will see you for less, or pro-bono. Just ask around. And do not be shy about seeing a shrink. You take aspirin for a headache.

I was affected by the disorder for more than a decade, even avoided going out my room for 5+ years because I was too afraid to bump into my housemates who i have been mute with. Well.. 4 month ago I met the love of my life.. and suddenly something within me just aligned, I want to be the best I can be for the person so everyday these past 4 months i have just been consistently putting myself into situations that would further desensitize me from my fears. Now I am comfortable living in my own house. It took me so long :(. I also did my 4th major change. Now I am doing psychology. I have always avoided pursuing this passion of mine because I did not believe that I was able help people esp since I was a wreck at socializing. \n\nNow one of the side things I am doing now is becoming an intern at this therapy venting site. It would help a lot if anyone reading this would click the link. That is all i need, for at least 80+ people to click on my link. \n\n( I clicked and it re-directed me to 7cups.com does it still count? Clicked Clicked it \ud83d\udc4d Clicked! I wish you the best of luck :)", "I feel to lazy to contribute to conversations I try to make online friends but 1. i am too awkward and do not know what to say and 2. I feel the want to not respond. I am so used to isolating myself that actually trying to talk to people online makes me tired. (I know this makes me sound like a douche) Does anyone else experience this? I used to experience the same thing. What worked for me was, after every conversation, asking myself, \u201cwhat can I to differently next time?\u201d In this process of self-analyzing my actions I found areas I could improve on in the next conversation. For instance, over text message I realized if someone asked me \u201cwhat is up\u201d or \u201chow are you\u201d I would answer their question, and then immediately divert the attention away from myself by asking them something, rather than waiting and allowing them to comment of what I said. This made me realize I needed to follow the flow of the conversation instead of abruptly shifting the topic to something else for fear the current topic was no longer interesting. In my next conversation I would try to avoid this mistake, and so on.\n\nAfter years of doing this (critiquing myself) I have become a pretty good conversationalist. It is the same as teaching yourself to do anything else; identify what you are doing wrong, and correct it next time. It is a lifelong process that never ends but will expand your capacity to experience life. Good luck!", "What are some of the worst things people have said about your inability to talk? One time, one of my classmates told me \"God gave you a mouth for you to talk with.\" \n\nI have also had some people call me arrogant.  \"I did not know you could talk\". This was said to me so many times by various classmates when I dared speak.  Very mocking and derogatory.\n\n\n\"Did they ever find out what was wrong with you?\". I was so offended I barely remember the context.  It was someone I barely knew from school and totally random.  Maybe near the end of high school. Been called arrogant and cold, it is saddening when people assume plus I had a rbf so I can kind of see why They think I am ignoring them so they ignore me back and treat me like I am not worth having around. \"use your big girl words\" People tell me to just talk, keep asking why I am not, get mad at me for not talking to them, and then sometimes if i do talk everyone makes a big deal out of it, which makes it harder. I have even had a friend who I have told about sm ask me repeatedly to talk to her, thinking that since I did once over a year ago I can again now (which I cannot, it is been getting worse) in 7th grade a teachers assistant tried to force me to read in front of probably 4 or 5 other people. she would say \"one page? one paragraph? come on a paragraph is not even that much.\" i was visibly uncomfortable and my clear discomfort made the other kids in my group uncomfortable and they tried to get her to stop. she wasted at least 15 minutes of our reading time trying to get me to talk i do not have any exact quotes, but people have told me in the past that i purposely do not talk. that i have some ulterior motive, like wanting sympathy or wanting to embarrass people. hearing that is so painful. I have had people take advantage of it, making me a scapegoat cause they knew I would lock up even more in interrogation style situations and would just take it. I have had rumors told about me that I was more of a wild animal than human. Yes this.  Certain psychopath kids identified me as an easy target because I could not defend myself or tell on them.  They took full advantage of hurting me. my head of year told my mother that he thought i was \"faking it\" \ud83d\ude0e \"You at least need to try to speak. I mean I never thought about it, thanks for everyone that said this to me. People are shitty and do not know how to behave or act decently when someone is not easily pegged into a category.  I am sorry you have to deal with such ignorant people :/ So insensitive \"You can talk to me anytime\" The people that say this mean well, but it shows they really just do not know me and likely never will. Even if someone is committed enough to ostracize themselves from basically everyone they should be treated better than that What even is trying to speak? Are they just trying to treat it like a speech impediment? \"Why cannot she talk? Does she not have a tongue or something?\" My classmate said this to me when I was about 11 years old. In front of me to my teacher and other classmates, it really hurt. I have had people talk to me as if I am mentally challenged\u2014you know, the slow, loud way people talk to you as if you are deaf. People do not realize that is  condescending A group of girls asked me if I had gotten beaten or raped and if that is why I would not talk. They were not coming from a good place either so it is not like they would have helped me if I actually had anything that bad happen to me. \"I will break her out of it\" or something along those lines, my 6th grade teacher.

It was humiliating. Just discovered this subreddit after not thinking about SM for awhile, I only had it from around age 4-8, but something that bothers me still is, if it comes up in conversation with my family, my grandma always likes to point out that she believes I was doing it \"on purpose\" and as \"revenge\" on my parents I had a teacher yell at me that o was just being defiant for bot being able to read a passage loud enough. She kept threatening to send me to the principal's office. Another teacher, when I did not answer her question said \"there is a difference between being shy and being disrespectful.\" That hurt a lot because I actually really liked that teacher and I wanted her to like me I was close to having an anxiety attack in school and this girl said \u201cYou know this is not cute, right\u201d. As if I was only faking it because I thought it was cute. My fourth grade teacher said something similar about me once \"Oh so you do not speak English\" it does not sound bad but the way they said it was so ignorant. It hurt alot. I look foreign where i live, Im a hijabi muslim. A way to make me feel more out of place than I already do.. It had been my birthday and my mum was with my whilst I was paying in money to the cashier - the cashier said \"cat got your tongue\" to me - my dad reported it and i got compensation and a massive box of sweets\n\nI have had all the comments under the sun said to me before sounds like we both had evil grandmas. i just found this sub too ! my grandma liked to guilt trip me and say she wish i said 1 word to her late husband before he died because he tried sooooo hard to get me to talk. i dont remember him actually doing anything. Nah my grandma is not evil, just misinformed / set in her ways. She just does not understand some things relating to mental health, and with selective mutism it is even easier to misunderstand the nature of it. People do not realize that it is an actual inability to speak, and the fact that it is \"selective\" makes it even harder for people to understand, in comparison to just normal mutism.", "(Question) How do I make my s/o who is SM feel safe &amp; happy? Hello r/selectivemutism! My name is Simon. I am a teenage dude who is dating a wonderful guy I will refer to as \"S\" on this post. We have been together for almost a year, and our communication is great - except sometimes there are very small bumps in the road. BTW, English is my 3rd language. I may say something poorly, please feel free to ask me for clarification or to correct any bad phrasing.\n\nMy boyfriend S is selectively mute. The majority of the time, we speak over text (long-distance). We call pretty infrequently, but he usually does not have his microphone, which is OK!\n\nNow and then he will have periods of time in which he does not talk to me. We have discussed this before, and it is difficult for him to notify me exactly when he will \"go mute\" (Apologies if my wording is weird). This is not a deal-breaker! It is simply a part of him which I will embrace and continue to love unconditonally. \n\nEssentially, I just wonder how can I make my boyfriend feel safe and happy in our relationship regarding his selective mutism. How do I not pressure him? How should I go about talking to him after or during these periods of time? Please do help, I want to make my boyfriend happy, so I will listen to what you all have to say! Thank you in advance. First off, it is incredible that you are willing to accept his SM and learn how to adapt with him. I think that is a great first step. From my experience, I knew it was weird that I did not talk and I did not want to acknowledge it. Just make sure he knows that you are always there to listen (or read, or whatever form of communication is normal). It does not sound like this is a problem, but do not pressure him or tease him or guilt him into talking. It kind of depends on your relationship, but get a good feel of his perception of even joking about it. Be supportive, and in social situations do what you can to make him comfortable and help him communicate without belittling him or calling attention to the fact that he is SM. Basically just treat him like anyone else. It is a communication barrier, but it does not define him. Encourage him to step out of his comfort zone, but make sure it is his choice if he ever takes a step. I think you are definitely on the right track. If you are curious about anything specific, hopefully I can answer your question. be comforting but not pushy. understand it is really overwhelming to communicate with selective mutism. make sure you let him know you care, but do not make it seem like he has to speak to you all the time to care about you. if and when you meet in person, s is probably going to be really anxious to speak verbally, so take him somewhere private and safe that you guys can still enjoy your time together. a method i used in therapy (for sm) is taking baby steps of speaking. like first i would try and speak to my therapist not facing her and from like across the room, even if it was just a whisper. then we moved closer and did things like talk arms length apart and elbows length to slowly feel comfortable and it made me feel a lot safer with my therapist even though i was mostly non-verbal with her. i think that it is wonderful you are trying to understand your boyfriends mental illness so that you can better support him. not many people, especially teenagers would think to do that. i have lots of respect for you :\u2022) \ud83d\udc95", "Asking for advice as Parent People who suffer from SM,  how do you wish your parents had supported you or helped you or what did they do that was helpful or harmful to your condition?  I want to encourage my child who gets embarrassed when I try to talk to her about why she finds it so difficult to communicate with people outside the family.  Any input is appreciated. These might be more specific to my personal situations but:\n\n* Listen to them. My mother has a very hard time listening to people and would often ignore me. I think this was harmful because it felt like I did not actually say anything in the times that I actually did. This is more specific to my mother, though, so, twisting this into general advice, react with enthusiasm (without overdoing it) when they do speak.\n* React with enthusiasm when they make any move to communicate, actually. I was always proud of how I could communicate \"normally\" through typing, texting, and writing. Some people, typically my mother and therapists, did not see it the same way. Communication is communication is communication whether it is verbal or not, and, since SM usually stems from severe SA, encouragement for those nonverbal achievements can genuinely be just as helpful as encouragement for verbal.\n* I did not want the teachers and my staff to know about it. I scored low in some assignments because of my SM, and my mother always immediately jumped to try and argue with them. This caused me severe anxiety, stress, and tears as I tried to get her to stop. It is good to stand up for your kid and for their school to know about their condition, but they honestly might really truly not care about the low scores and would only have a panic attack as a result. Thanks that helps As someone who no longer has selective mutism, I can thank the hard work of my mother for that. What helped me was therapy and medication. I started Prozac when I was 8 and saw a therapist who helped motivate me to be more social and start talking. I know it is controversial with children, but medication was crucial. Not long after starting Prozac, I was able to talk to my father whom I would never felt comfortable enough to speak to. \nI think aside from psychiatric treatment, the most important thing you could do as a parent is supporting your child. They need to know that it is not their fault they cannot talk.

I definitely do not have all the answers, just some suggestions, but for sure your best life is worth fighting for! \ud83d\udcaf With a clean slate. I was mute from as early as I can remember up until the start of middle school and the only reason I started talking is *because* I started middle school. Nobody knew me, nobody knew I was mute, so nobody knew any better when I started talking like a regular kid who would never been mute at all. It was a lot easier when everyone just treated me normally because, to them, I *was* normal.  I am 18 too, my SM really got bad in 6th grade although it is definitely been around since I am very very young (Pre-Kish) is probably when it really started. Up until 2011ish (I was born in Nov of '02, so I am 8ish in this particular instance)...I have video where I was openly conversating with my Brother. Although I do not remember those days in my head, at all. I used to tell my Mom, \"I love you,\" all day long apparently to the point where she got annoyed by it.\n\nAlthough during that time I remember never talking to my Aunt in Elementary School since she was the Nurse, and I never found the need to talk during that time. I actually had 2 girl friends and they would buy snacks for me...I never really spoke to them, I then would have a best friend, guy....who I never really spoke to, and I did not speak to his family. Though in Middleschool or 6th grade is when I fully became SM, I was nervous about 'new people' and did not talk at all to the students there, well besides a few select....I did get a friend group, but I literally just smiled and laughed at the kid to become friends, he was a friend of past friends so that made it easier. I would at some point grow apart from that friend group. In 7th grade, I actually went into my Science class and the first day when the teacher was calling names, I TALKED!......but she never heard me, my friend did who sat near me....so I gave up.\n\nIn highschool I was well-known as the kid who did not talk, I was never bullied although there were assholes. Though by this point school was just sort of the 'people I knew,' and I could not talk to them normally, I could talk to the new friend group I found in Highschool when I hung out with them, although I still did not start conversations....I talked with them on Xbox and just translated that energy into IRL. Though IRL rarely happens, because I am known as flakey, and as someone who does not want to hang out (I would though, now)......I have since stopped playing Xbox alot as I find it boring, which now when I go on, I really speak in a whisper because I do not want my family hearing me, in the past they could hear me.\n\nThough now if I went back to Highschool, I believe I could try to talk even if the people were 'the people that I knew.' I also wished I told my parents to transfer me to a NEW HS during that time, 9th grade.....but I never did. This is jsut the mindset I have developed over the last month. I met a girl, and realized that in life I do want things, and I can only get them if I change.\n\nNow I can talk to strangers, although I am nervous (when I am alone, not in the presence of those that know I do not talk). I do not have a Job....and I am going into my 2nd year of College where I plan to speak normally since the 1st year was online, but my MOM....she told the college I did not speak, now I am transferring out of there....if I play it right, to a college where my brother does not go and only I go to. If my Mom tries to tell them I do not talk, I am going to stop her because that does not help me. I thought college was already going to be a dive into 'new waters,' but my Mom ruined that....my bad though, I never informed her my true issues. I actually did make videos where I spoke, but as soon as she informed them I stopped speaking to those teachers and in those online classes. The only fear there was my family could hear me talking from the other rooms.\n\nNow today, the next thing I have to do is to inform my Mom not to 'finish my thoughts/sentences' or guess what I am trying to say, it just hurts me. I think the best thing we can do is make our \"hurts for speaking purposes\"....\"what makes it hard?\" known to those we want to try to speak to. I have been thinking for a while to write out an essay or short paper on my own thoughts and just giving it to my parents/family....but I cannot. The thing is if everyone forgot I could not speak, I could speak pretty good the same day. Though that cannot occur.\n\nI want to pursue that girl I met too, but something like that I have never been able to discuss with my parents.....I would not want to without them knowing it, since idk.....I do not leave the house on my own intuition...I have a car, my Dad bought me....but I still do not leave the house on my own.\n\nAnyways that is sort of my auto-biography....I hope that helps you, being here and reading all about each other's experiences with SM has given me more peace...although no true motivation for change was there, until I met that girl (and that is more a drive, than I think that will work out).....In the past I did not want to hear anything about anyone like me, because I hate people like me, and I still do, nothing personal. It just all sucks, and I hate it all. Though I kind of want to 'Recover' as well for everyone here, I want to be able to come back here saying \"I MADE IT!\" I want that to occur before I turn 19 too, any later and it will not sit well. That is 106 days....and it is been 32 days since I wanted to actually change. In the past I never truly wanted change, although I was \"trying,\" I never was, not in any way that would make me feel honest about saying it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: And also I have written like 10 essays on this sub already lol, this is all I do all day. And the biggest problem is my reliance on my parents, they always protected me when it really just hurt me the most. Yo I am so glad I am not the only one who finds it harder to talk when the other person knows you normally do not talk.. My mom looked at me weird when I told her and I thought I was just faking all of it for attention, cause to me it made no sense.

I replied reminding them of those, also grandstanding about how if they do not come out into the open with this it will take longer to solve the cat over-population problem and more cats will suffer blah blah) and again got a \"just call us\" reply. Yes, just the *capitalist* utopian ideal would be them adding a new page to their site so more in our community can trap and take care of colonies, And I probably made a wrong turn suggesting that after the first message when they wanted to be DL about prices.

I have been reading up on sm for about a year just out of curiosity, but this year I met this kid in my film club who seems like he might have sm. He does not really speak and is always looking down, sits in the corner of the room alone, etc. I have had short conversations with him about movies and our weekends but only really when I asked about him first (I did not know about phrasing things as yes/no questions before) or he will raise his hand if we are splitting up jobs for future projects. After meetings he always zooms out alone. I do not want to make him feel uncomfortable or more anxious but I really am interested in being his friend. I kind of speak too much when I am anxious or trying to impress new people, but I do not want to push him or make him hate me. I kind of called him out in a big room once and I probably should not have drawn attention to him but I did not realize. I always ask if he is interested in joining a project though bc he might not speak up if our leader does not hear him or see his hand raised. I just wanted to ask from those with sm how I can show him I want to be friends without pressuring him to talk? Maybe you could just outright ask him to be your friend? \n\nHe will probably get all embarrassed and unable to answer right away and maybe even worried about what is expected of him, so just tell him your not expecting anything of him other than being friends who sometimes hangout and whatever and that you can give him some time to get used to the idea, no pressure. That is so cute that you want to do that. I would see if you can get his contact information first, he might be more comfortable messaging you. Tell him you have no expectations for him to speak, maybe ask if he has sm. I am sure that if you are just open about it that he will see that you genuinely care. He sounds just like me 20 years ago, when I had crippling social anxiety, so I think I can answer this. Chances are, he does not want to be alone. Like, I can almost guarantee it. I was always alone til 8th grade when someone trustworthy was kind enough to start talking to me. It made me so happy. My anxiety level decreased dramatically. I felt like I was not a nothing anymore. \n\nSo if he shows any indication of interest in being your friend (which it sounds like he does), and especially if he smiles, then I believe he would be absolutely thrilled if you befriended him. Even if he does not show it. Keep in mind that it is difficult for people with social anxiety to show gratitude or interest, verbally of course but also non-verbally. When your heart is racing and you feel like you could pass out all the time, you do not look like a person who is interested in making friends. But this is exactly what keeps people with social anxiety from improving. They do not look welcoming, so people assume they are rude or want to be alone, which is anything but true.\n\nI think you are a great person for wanting to be his friend. But keep in mind, chances are his self esteem is low. He might wonder why you are wanting to be his friend, if no one else pays attention to him. Plenty of kids at my school would talk to me, ask me questions, and I would quickly learn they were either just curious or wanted to insult me. So if he seems guarded, be persistent and try your best to let him know you are genuine. Gaining his trust could take a while if he is had bad experiences with others. It is best not to mention anything about him being \"shy\" or \"quiet\". I know it is difficult since he does not communicate much, but try to treat him like your other friends as much as possible. Any attempts to \"get\" him to talk will cause him to instantly distrust you, but it does not sound like you are like that.\n\nYou are right, yes or no questions are good. But even better is written communication, so he can ask you questions and provide answers that are not yes or no. Then you can identify mutual interests and that might help him open up more. Back when I was in this situation we did not have internet chat and cell phones. I think starting with giving him a way to contact you is a great start. Maybe when there are not other people around. I did better interacting with individuals rather than groups of people. If you approach him and you are with your friends he will likely feel outnumbered and, like I mentioned, wonder if your intentions are not good.\n\nLastly, you said you think you speak too much, but this is great. If you did not speak a lot and he speaks very minimally if at all, he would likely feel awkward. Do not feel bad at all about speaking a lot. You sound like you would be an amazing friend, and it is great that you want to reach out to him. I have selective mutism. I always loved it when people talked to me. I hated myself because they were so nice and i didnt say anything back. Maybe you can tell him that it is ok and that even though it is unthinkable now one day he can talk (more) and that evem if he cant he still matters just like any other person.", "I never know how I feel (This might not be the correct place to post this but Selective Mutism is one of my main diagnoses and I do not know where else to post it.)

If I were to hazard a guess just based off the little information you provided, it might be that you are experiencing some sort of PTSD from the abusive friendship and sexual assault.

", "Please help idk I have selective mutism but whatever it is, it sucks and ruining my life I do not know if what I am dealing with is actually selective mutism so please forgive me if it is not, but I really need an answer. \n\nI have dealt with depression my whole life pretty much and also a lot of anxiety recently. I grew up in a somewhat abusive/emotionally neglectful household (I say somewhat bc I never really talked about it enough to be definite but even wo the label it was a hard place to grow up). When I was young, I taught myself that the only 2 emotions that were acceptable was happiness (bc being quirky and cute and funny made people like me) and sadness (but only when I was alone). Everything else I did my best to push down and ignore even if it meant not feeling anything at all. Another thing I had taught myself was that I should never tell anyone anything I thought \"mattered.\" Which basically meant anything that I thought made me vulnerable to attacks. This did not just mean talking about feelings and stuff, but even a simple \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\" would be answered with lies in case my real answer was scrutinized or ridiculed. Sometimes it was easier to just say nothing if I thought that saying anything was too dangerous. \n\nThis mostly applied to my own parents or any adult authority figure. When my dad had locked me in my room to angrily confront/eventually threaten me into telling him about my depression/suicidal tendencies I did not say anything and was stuck in there for hours. When they took me to see therapist over the years I lied through them until I met one who actually seemed like he cared and who I actually trusted, but even though I desperately wanted to talk to him I literally could not bring myself to speak. It was frustrating how every session I would have so many things I wanted to talk about in my head to just end up sitting there crying in silent frustration. We made a little headway but not much and eventually I stopped seeing him. \n\nFast forward to now. I am still depressed as hell and now with some bonus GAD! I am seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist (who I do not really like but w everything going on I am not sure if I will be able to find another one) and I still cannot bring myself to talk about anything /real/. I end up downplaying my experiences or straight up lying about how I am feeling, bc I know if I actually try to talk about it something will literally block me from saying anything. And when I say that most people usually think I mean that it is just really really really hard to talk about and that is not it. I mean LITERALLY impossible, like my vocal chords just refuse to cooperate. Dealing with this my whole life has made it impossible to reach out to anyone let alone mental health professionals, but my mental health has been spiraling down the drain and I am starting to really lose hope. \n\nAlso this problem has caused serious rifts in my relationship. Everything else is literally perfect except my tendency to go mute whenever we get into an argument. And my bf is a sweetheart who never raises his voice, but when I detect frustration or tension between us bc of a conflict it sets me off into some major anxiety and even though I want to talk about it and resolve whatever the misunderstanding is I physically CANNOT bring myself to speak. And my bf thinks that I am just trying to avoid the conflict even though I have explained that I DO want to talk I just literally cant. And even if he does get it, he gets frustrated/stressed out by me not talking bc he feels helpless bc he doesnt know how to make me better and make it stop and honestly neither do I. \n\nAnd anyway idk if anyone's going to read this, but if you do I really need some help. I do not know how I am going to keep going like this. I am so tired and in pain all the time and if I do not figure out how to get help I dont know what I am going to do.

Be kind to yourself.", "My drunken thoughts Here is some backstory:\nEver since I could remember, since then first day of developmental kindergarten, I dealt with \"selective\" mutism. I had such bad social anxiety, that I literally did not talk to anyone outside my immediate family. I remember once, staying the night at a friends place. I \"accidentally\" said a word, and freaked the hell out. \n\nI did not communicate. By the time high school came around, I literally had no friends. They all left me, some even treating me like garbage in the process. Everyone treated me like some freak, like someone who was mentally disabled (not that you should treat them different than any normal person), or just ignored me. \n\nI wanted to die. The lonliness made me ask a God I didnt even believe in at the time, to end it. To end me. I was that lonely and depressed. But I knew a single person who had once treated me like a normal person. Literally the only person in the world who treated me like a normal person. I later on reached out to her. She saved my life. I talked to her eventually. This eventually lead to me joining a church group for young adults. There, for the first time in my life, I talked to a group of people. It felt like a weight had been lifted. My entire life changed from that day. \n\nIn the end, it has made me a better person in a way. I have worked customer service, ironically enough, for a good 8 years now. While it has made me a little jaded, my youth years made me understand what it is like to be treated with hate, disdain, and everything like that. It made me want to never treat someone the way I had been treated. I have made some amazing friends, and have made an amazing impact on someone else's life. I still deal with depression and lonliness sometimes, but my life has improved beyond that which words can explain. I never truly understood my issues, other than acknowledging it as severe social anxiety. But for those of you who deal with the same \"SM\" th hat I dealt with, I just want to tell you this:\n\nTalk.\n\nIt is hard. It may seem impossible. It doesnt make any sense why it is hard and impossible. But you will live. You will be alive. Humans cannot exist without social interactions. You will experience happiness and love.

You will change lives, and bring happiness to those who drown in sorrow like you yourself do. \n\nYou will be free. Thanks for sharing your story. I keep meaning to put my own out there, and now I feel inspired to actually do that. I am just curious...how did your family handle your SM? How did you communicate what you were feeling? I feel like the hardest part for me growing up was expressing to people why I did not talk. How I was not \"shy.\" How \"selective\" did not mean it was a choice. You are right, it does not make sense why the thought of speaking is so crippling, so it is difficult to explain to other people when we cannot even comprehend it ourselves.", "Selective Mute that wants to sing I am 15 with Selective Mutism but I want to learn to sing.

Music has always been a huge coping method for me but I feel like making my own songs will make it even more expressive.

I do know there is definitely an influx of people asking whether or not they have SM, but it is understandable because often times people with anxiety will attempt to seek reassurance.

I dont really like sharing a lot but its online, so it is alright. I felt it was important bc elective mutism is similar and real.", "Join the Selective Mutism Discord!

It is great when people make an effort to raise awareness.", "How do others support you when you say you or your child has SM I do bring up and discuss about SM in other public online forums whenever possible in the hope that it will spread awareness.\n\nI was discussing about how to get school on board in supporting child with SM. As many are unaware of the condition, it is often difficult to make schools agree for adjustments and additional support.\n\nBelow are some of the reactions I received:\n\n1. People accused me of being selfish to demand 45 mins of 1-1 time from teacher each week to do fade in sessions. They said this is injustice to normal kids as they do not get similar attention. And teachers would be spending this 45 mins doing more productive things for normal kids instead.\n\n2. Some said, kids with SM should not be in regular schools but be in Special needs schools. They went on and said this is why they prefer more private schools because private schools can kick any students out who they do not want and other bright kids do not need to put up with such nonsense.\n\n3. When I said, \"kids with SM do not need 1-1 attention throughout, they only need bit of adjustments and teachers around need to be educated about the condition to support effectively\", one of the participant claiming to be an educator got offended and said they will never help kids of parents who think teachers need to be educated. He/she said teachers are already heavily educated and do not need parents to say that they need to be educated.\n\n4. Last comment I received is - \"Stop telling/treating your child like they are a nutter. Stop the media campaign advertising to your child they are a nutter with some kind of condition no one else understands\"\n\nI know people can be mean in online forums as they do not know people whom they are taking to. But, I wonder if people in real world think the same when we say our problems - though they do not express it.\n\nFor me, most concerning is comment made by teacher (3). If we cannot tell teacher their understanding is incorrect and offer more information without offending them, how can we ever get required help for our kids. I hope most of the teachers are not like that.", "Is it bad that I kind of want to stay mute? I have had selective mutism since I was a child. It was really bad when I was public school aged, but has gotten better now that I am in college and in the workforce. The strange thing is that I find comfort in not speaking. I have always naturally been quiet on top of selective mutism, and I simply do not have a reason to be loud. I have also noticed that my interpersonal social skills have suffered because of SM and I oftentimes find myself lost in conversations.\n\nIs it weird that I would rather be mute than be forced to speak? It would prevent me from having awkward conversations, plus my anxiety goes down when I do not have to speak. \n\nDo you think finding comfort in SM should be widely accepted? Also, does anyone here have experience with their mutism becoming permanent or getting worse with age? It is not bad. I do not blame you. You are wise. The Sisters that taught me, some of them took a vow of silence. I think it is very powerful so long as you can manage in our society. Honestly, I was planning to learn to sign just so that I could talk to restaurant people easily. I do not like talking. It hurts and it makes me tired. Does this make sense to anyone else? Do you know how they expressed to others that they were mute? I feel you haha. That is partially why I would rather stay mute. I am just not sure if others would understand since its seen as an anxiety coping mechanism and not an actual 'problem'. I\u2019s been almost 10 years now since I am able to talk to people quite normally, but still I am more comfortable when I do not have to speak. Especially when there are people around that I do not know well. I sometimes find myself mostly listening to conversations. And I think that is absolutely not bad. Anxiety being down when not speaking, and finding comfort in not speaking is a symptom of SM. If you were to start recovery that would go away along with the rest of your SM. I have recovered, and the same thoughts held me back for probably a year or longer. I wish I had just sought help anyway, since I no longer feel that way after recovering. I definitely enjoy not talking quite a bit, especially when it frustrates people I am not interested in talking to, but it is a skill that I have to practice or it will be too difficult when I need it. It still hampers me in some parts of life, particularly when I am upset, especially with emotions like grief I find I am unable to communicate when I should be reaching out to help others. I get you.\n\nSometimes I do not even have to do presentations in class since the teachers know I will not speak.\n\nIf it is a group presentation, I kind of just stand there not doing anything.\nThe people in the group do not really complain or anything, since they are so used to me being like this. I know. Most of the time when I tell people about it they say they understand about having social phobia and they had to put their fears behind them. That is not what I am referring to. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f   I completely feel what you mean, when I am at any place and I am not pressured to talk, only hear and maybe nod, is so amazing. The problem is that the most of the time I want to talk something, but I just cannot.\n\n  When I was a kid I could talk more openly with my friends, but as years passed I got some trouble in communicating and now in school for example (when we could go to school) I talked to no one, maybe wave my hand when someone said 'Hello' and say 'Hi' back in such a low voice that I heard, and I even went to the bathroom in the break and spend the whole break there or sit in a bank looking to the wall. I have been on different doses of anti-anxiety meds for a little over a year. Even when I am at my highest dose I still struggle with social skills because I have spent over 20 years not speaking. Even then it feels like I would be best mute. My energy can be completely drained by a 5 minute speech. Anxiety meds or antidepressants are pretty infamous for doing nothing to SM. They are best used alongside exposure therapy. Sometimes I feel like that. Because I am somewhat able to speak people assume I am just as comfortable with it etc as your typical person but it is not the truth. I feel that people maybe would be more understanding if I was completely mute but do not understand it now. They never had to. They never left the convent.", "i think i have SM idk i have all the symptoms, but my mum just says it is social anxiety &amp; general shyness. she is in denial about her mental illness so i feel like she is in denial about my issues too. i want to tell someone at school about this, because i am only young &amp; have a chance to treat it but i am worried it will all be for nothing sometimes when i am trying so hard to speak but i physically cannot i violently yell &amp; start crying too. i do not know if frustration is part of it or not but it seems like useful information:/ I am very sorry that your mom is in denial. \n\nDo you maybe have some kind of school nurse, or a school counselor? Those may be the right ones to talk to first, or if you do not have this at your school, a teacher that you trust may be a good choice, too. \n\nI hope you will find someone to talk to who will be able to help you.   \nI understand that it is scary to look for help, especially when one sees the possibility that one will not find help. What has helped me is the realization, that   \n1. when I ask for help and people do not help me, it is not my fault, it is not that they do not help me because I am not worthy of help, maybe they were not able to, maybe they simply are not nice to me. But being rejected does not reflect on my \"worth\" as a human being.   \n2. If I do not ask, how should they know that I want their help?  \n3. If I do not succeed in attaining help the first time I try, it feels like stumbling and falling - and it is basically the same as when I fail in other areas: Failing hurts, falling hurts, but it is not the end of the world and as long as I get up again and try again or try something else, it is going to be ok. \n\nI wish you all the best, and I hope very much that you will get the support that you need! Talk to a counselor. the sooner, the better. I waited for mine to get treated, now its so bad that its too late. Please talk to someone. If your mom really cares then she would try to help you, trust me. Do not be like me and wait, it can get scary. My SM is worse than ever before because I never got the help I needed. Councillors are there for a reason, and that is to help you. If you cannot talk to them, write it down. Write down everything you are feeling and if you are comfortable enough show them. They will want to help you, and it wont be for nothing. Its worse to keep it inside and will only make everything worse later on. and if you need someone to talk to, we are here.", "When people try to talk to you, do you have any thoughts to respond with, but you are too anxious to do it, or is your mind empty?

We can chat a bit online beforehand. I am thinking about joining a virtual meetup group to try to practice, but I think a 1 on 1 would help me acclimate first.\n\nEdit: I grew up with selective mutism but have done a 180 since. I just started browsing this sub to see others with similar experiences and how their lives have been affected. This is great! I did not know Discord groups like this existed. What did you do to get over your selective mutism? lol no.. \ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\ude48 There is not one answer that I can give. It was multiple of things that helped with my mental health. At 16, I started praying more, I started using a journal, I read a lot of books and manga, I got close to a group of friends and I felt very accepted. At 17, I met a celebrity and we met for many days, that gave me a lot of confidence! I also changed schools and met more people who were very nice to me. My grades started getting better, a lot of people were supportive. That is when I practiced talking in real life to real people and then at 18, people said that I was a chatter box and extremely outgoing. I really did not stop talking at all!\n\nAgain, a lot of things happened to me that I cannot type it all, but those were the main things that I feel helped me a lot.\n\nAsk yourself these - am I being bullied or abused? is there an external factor affecting my mental health? am I loved and supported? Am I currently experiencing symptoms of PTSD? Is there anyone that I can trust and can talk to? Do I like my voice? Do I like my face? Talk in front of a mirror and identify what you feel when you are talking, what do you like about yourself and what do you hate about yourself when you talk. I hope that is me in 3 years time, I am 18. At 16 I was still where I am now, although I am better...but no more motivated (well kind of, not really) than I was then. But then I really never pictured me talking like a normal person. I never ever took that outside perspective deeply. you think one on one or group call would be better? I might be able to help; I can speak on the phone I am just not that talkative. It would be an exposure exercise for me too. I mean, I might not say anything either, we would just hear one another breathe lol. One on one sounds better. Groups make me hesitant.  Lol. Same. But I am glad I feel comfortable talking here.", "I think I have SM too, but I am generally very social. Can you all clarify it for me? I am generally actually very outgoing . But ever since I was small, if there was a problem (like if I got in trouble, which my father was the disciplinarian, and I was very fearful of him) I could never speak.\n\nEarly on I was regarded as eloquent, a \u201cgifted\u201d child. So whenever I was asked to explain myself\u2014 usually my feelings or emotions were rejected(?) Or disregarded when asked to explain myself.\n\nWhich was frustrating. Even as a kid. So soon enough I would simply cry (because what was the point of talking if everything I said was not valuable?). If there was a problem or I was in trouble and asked to explain myself\u2014 we would be up well into the night without me saying a word\u2014 and me crying until I was exhausted. But still very hurt and unresolved.\n\nNow as an adult, married and all\u2014 my husband finds it frustrating that if I am hurting I will not speak. And I will just cry.\n\nFrom my pov, it physically hurts to explain myself. My tongue hurts, my mouth aches, it is like it fastens shut at the mere attempt at forming words. Which frustrates me and makes me cry even more.\n\nEarly on in our relationship, when I was hurting or going through something\u2014 I could only write it out.\n\nI got better I thought. But last night it happened again. And I could not speak. Just cry. Wracked with pain all over just to form zero words. Withdrawing completely.\n\n\nFor someone who is usually outgoing\u2014 these situations are extremely frustrating. I really cannot talk when asked to say how I am feeling or why I am hurting at all.\n\n\nI cannot find anything anywhere on it. SM is the only thing that makes sense. Help? Sounds like trauma from your childhood, if your father was... harsh with his disciplining? Even still, many parents used to do the whole \"tell me what happened and I will not be mad/you will not get in trouble\" for them to turn around and... do exactly those things causing children to have trauma around conflict resolution. \n\nWhether it is sm or not, therapy would help but also explaining to your husband it is easier for you to write your thoughts vs. saying them and use that as a way to work through conflict or whatever. Thank you so much for this reply. I am 100% considering therapy.\n\nThe only reason I even mustered up anything to post here was because I really do shut down. And even though I desperately want to speak\u2014 under high stress I really cannot. I do not want to seem like I just want to say I have sm.\n\n But the moments I go silent sure are selective.\n\nThank you again. \ud83d\udc95 It might be worth your while to look into complex ptsd. The situations you describe- being forced to explain yourself to the point of staying up half the night, then having your perspective rejected or disregarded- all that can be traumatic for a child.\n\nThat does not mean it is not SM, in my opinion. SM is a form of anxiety, and anxiety can be trauma-derived. I have symptoms of SM myself which I believe resulted from early childhood trauma. I have also encountered people with similar symptoms on r/cptsd and r/emotionalneglect. I relate so much! I think selective mutism is a spectrum. I would love to see if this was actual factual! Peer reviewed and all!", "I had SM as a kid. I am 25 now. AMA ", "SM advice please I have a daughter 4y I think she has SM. Can someone with SM give some advice what were helpfull things you expirirenced or words said by your parents you might think could help to child that has SM? Try to find some alternatives such as writing something down when she cannot speak. And tell trusted people in her environment that you suspect this. They might get angry and think she\u2018s arrogant if she does not talk back one day. That is especially important for teachers. I am not a specialist so not know if is better to support her gently to speak or let her. But today are apps for nonverbal people. And I use plenty of emoji and animated stickers (like at FB chat) when communicating. I personally feel it easier to send some animated emojis or pictures, especially for feelings and moods. When I was young in kindergarten and elementary school, they never forced me too much to interact with peers, I was happy alone. Just occasionally interact with some other silent kid. I find it beneficial to find some other silent peer to befriend with. Try not to put pressure in her for not talking Honestly my parents were not the best at saying or doing things that helped. But I can say somethings that you probably should not say or do to your daughter. One of the most important one is just do not pressure your daughter into speaking to people or someone. And do not get mad or angry if she does not speak to someone. People with SM do not Choose not to talk it like they cannot. Not that you cannot actually speak just that in select social situation it is can be impossible to speak. I do not thank that was very good advice but that all I could think of to say right now. Not making a big fuss about it, or about when/if she speaks would be my advice. Lower the pressure as much as possible, but leave the door open. Try not to draw attention to her silence around other people. You do not have to put her in a 'shy' box.\n\nKids pick up on your energy too. Try to be relaxed as possible about her speech in the moment and not add your own anxiety to hers. \n\nTry to understand that SM is an anxiety disorder and it is not necessarily caused by anything other than temperament. It is not something you can talk or force someone out of. However, professional therapy can help! CBT, with an emphasis on the B for Behaviour (since cognitive stuff is hard with little kids) has some good evidence in helping SM. Play therapy has some decent evidence too. I wish my parents cared as much as you do lol and yeah I agree with the writing idea, although I am not sure what \u2018level\u2019 she is at with writing for her age Hi not sure what \u2018level\u2019 she is at with writing for her age, I am dad. your bot is shit and unfunny Same situation here though I am not 100% sure, but it is the reason I came upon this subreddit and try write encouragement to people here occasionally. Feel free to DM me. We might be going through similar experiences, or not... Who knows!\n\nFull disclosure I do not agree with a fair amount of the sentiment in this subreddit only because I feel some people identify so strongly with the diagnosis that they decide \"Yup, that is me.\" And likely limit and do not fully comprehend their own ability to adapt if they so choose. Still love and support you all regardless! Try not to \"other\" your child while you take her experiences into account. Do not point her out as different when it is unnecessary. Let her make friends freely, if she prefers to be alone let her, introduce her to other people like her, quiet people, non verbal people, the speaking and hearing impaired community is amazing. Introduce her to creative outlets, drawing, painting, writing, music, later on coding, editing, whatever she will latch on. It can be an important way of expressing thoughts that cannot be spoken. And like with any kid, give her support, guidance and boundaries you can back up well, but also give her space to develop as her own person and make mistakes without making a big deal of her short comings. Mistakes are to be learned from, not punished for. Creativity and curiosity are magnificent gifts that will get her far in life. Feed them.", "Can selective mutism be VERY selective (phones and stores?) As a kid I was never officially diagnosed but in first and second grade had a slew of teachers notes saying I refused to talk when called on and I had to go to speech therapy. That time of my life was pretty traumatic (my sister was having seizures and we had recently been homeless) so I do not remember much of those years. Even after that I was a really \"shy\" quiet kid who had difficulty communicating. In middle school they diagnosed me with GAD and ADHD. \n\nAs an adult I can talk to most people but sometimes when I pick up a phone I just cannot make sound and i hang up. The same thing happens at the store. I force myself to say thank you or answer when they ask if I need a bag but outside of that I can barely talk.  At restaurants I have my wife order for me.\n\nOutside of these situations I can talk normally, though I often choose not to. \nIs this SM or just a manifestation of my anxiety disorder? Obviously none of us in this subreddit can diagnose you, but I think we are all aware of that. This is the internet, so just from what I know of SM from my own struggles with a lack of speech, it does not sound like selective mutism. \n\nI recently read the Body Keeps the Score, it is about trauma, and the author talks about how trauma can make you go mute. Apparently there is an area of the brain (Broca's area) involved with speech that gets shut down when you are highly aroused and scared, and for that reason people might be struck dumb literally when faced with a big enough threat, and then if they develop trauma, they might keep going back to that same mute, over aroused state. So that is a case of a lack of speech and other forms of communication without selective mutism. Struggling to get words out is not always SM.\n\nFor you to be diagnosed with SM, you also have to be significantly impaired by the lack of speech. You sound like you communicate in a very normal way and just have anxiety around certain specific tasks. I actually was never diagnosed and no longer struggle with speech, but for me, I used to be functionally mute most of the time. My parents did not give a shit, my grades went down the drain, I did not develop friendships, could not basically communicate with teachers or anyone else. Avoided all social situations, practically, except bare minimum contact with my family. That is how bad things were for a long time, years. Sorry to kind of one up you, I am just using my own story to try to explain what impairment might mean. Yes, this does sound like SM. It is not uncommon for SMers to only be able to speak a few small words while being unable to speak otherwise.", "I am not sure what to do to help me start talking I am trying to start talking outside of home, my family and the teachers at the school know I want to, but I am not sure how I should practice. Should I try talking to a teacher? Should I try practicing talking on discord or anything else with voice chat? I really need help here, any suggestions would be really helpful. Why not start by asking your teacher or someone you are comfortable with to ask *you* what your favorite item from a certain category is?\n\nYou could make note cards they could draw from a bag and ask you that way you know what to expect from a question and can have a bullet point list of answers to help guide you and prepare you. Do you talk when no one is around?\n\nMaybe start speaking your mind even when others are around and think about how important honesty is to you.

Do you? yes Sometimes Coughing is usually something I cannot control yes but I am more self conscious about them  \n like am I sniffling too much? is it annoying people? is my breathing too loud? I used to go to great lengths to avoid them in some situations. So, part of my mutism was not being able to make any sort of sound in some situations. I guess I only tried hard to avoid them, since something like sneezing, for example, is not something you can willingly eliminate. But yeah, having people say \"bless you\" when I sneezed really stressed me out. I used to feel so bad I could not handle it the way other people did. Able to make them minimally. Hiccups, coughs, throat clearing, nose blowing, etc are all mostly silent. I find myself getting annoyed at people around me who cannot do these things quietly, before reminding myself that my way of going about it is not common. I am only just now getting used to being comfortable making those sounds again now that I live in my own house, but I live with two other people still so sometimes I still have to mentally prepare myself just to clear my throat but I am getting better.

Of course it was worth it. Think of it this way: feeling comfortable not talking is a symptom of SM. As you recover, that slowly goes away. I definitely do not miss not being able to talk, because for me it was something I was trapped behind. Recovering terrified me, but I am much happier now that I have. I am getting better currently in the process of recovering. I think in the end, the point is you feel comfortable and safe even when talking, and not talking does not provide any extra barrier of safety. you feel comfortable in talking. I think it was definitely worth it. When I look back on how I used to be, I was isolated and a pretty sad kid. Now that I have recovered, I realize that I actually do like interacting with people, although I definitely still have social anxiety to some degree. When I am with people, being too silent actually makes me more uncomfortable just because I do not want people to think of me as the quiet one or say that I never talk. This will be my second time recovering, so while I am comfortable now talking in my mother tongue and English I am slowly working on my French. It is worth it because I will now be able to talk to my in-laws. It is a terrible feeling of wanting to answer a question or say something and the words just do not come out. Especially when I am allergic to something they are serving. &gt;not talking does not provide any extra barrier of safety.\n\nI do not know if that is true. I remember not too long ago reading that shyness/being silent is an evolved trait in children and babies so they would not be found by predators.\n\nAlso \"Better to be thought a fool..\", is my personal experience as I believe ridicule was a large part for me. Certainly in high school it feels like it would have been worse had I responded any more than I did. It was 100% worth it. For me the safety of not talking was a false safety. In reality not talking was never any sager than talking and the comfort of silence was not true comfort but a false acceptance of the way things did not have to be. Talking allows me to convey my needs, get what I want and form closer bonds than I ever did when I could not talk.  I now enjoy interacting with other people, including strangers.\n\nThe pain of wanting to interact with the world and fear of judgment  was never worth any of the false sense of security silence gave me. As it turns out negative judgement is both rarer and less painful than you think. Not even for a second do I wish to go back. I am so much more comfortable now that I have recovered. My years with SM were so miserable, even though I did not fully realise it at the time because I did not recognise what my own feelings were. I did not have joy or happiness to compare with. Now I do.\n\nI used to think silence was safety, but that just made me live in fear. I always thought I would feel that way after recovering too, but it went away as my anxiety around speaking lessened.

Many descriptions of selective mutism feels relatable to my childhood. I was a quiet kid, weary of strangers, fearful of openly having an opinion on anything, funny inside my head (but would not dare to actually tell the joke). But as I never went 100 % mute, I am weary of thinking I actually had SM as a kid(and I try not to self-diagnose anyway). I would give one word answers like \"Yeah.\" or \"No, or shake my head and shrug my shoulders. Then I could be talkative in one-to-one company when I trusted someone. \n\nSo I am just wondering if social anxiety, general anxiety or an insecure attachement style could cause \"SM light\" or similar symptoms? That is why it is called selective - it is triggered by social anxiety and fear \nFor example I have problem speaking in empty room to myself or to camera. But one to one with known person is ok. Yes of course, these conditions are all highly comorbid and share certain similarities. The thing to remember is that a psychological condition is an attempt to describe certain elements of a person's personality. It is a way of trying to helpfully categorize their individual experiences, ideally towards the goal of treating whatever behaviours are causing distress or disorganization.\n\nYou do not need to fall into being 100%mute to fit under selective mutism, if you feel any sort of anxiety that causes you to go even partially mute, and this is causing issues in your life as you perceive it, then that fits under the definition of 'selective mutism' SM is basically really severe social anxiety.  The anxiety gets so high it goes to panic then you get the freeze response (the fight, flight, freeze, fawn axis of survival instincts). yeah, there are a lot of people who used to have selective mutsim but now have a severe social anxiety, which is like a step down from selective mutism. Yeah, I had/have diagnosed SM but never went completely mute(other than maybe a day at a time occasionally if something happened that made things worse like being forced to talk in class) so yeah it is completely possible you still had or have it even though you were not completely mute Thank you. Looking back, I feel like I was at least close to selective mutism as a child, as I was very quiet, worried about expressing myself, and would freeze up in some situations.", "Does anyone have any suggestions for an action plan? I am a teenager who developed selective mutism around the age of 10. I went to a new school with new kids and I just never talked. I always assumed eventually when I got more comfortable around the new kids I would start talking, I never did. And that has been the story of my life up until now where I am a sophomore in high school. I am extremely social around my family and my close friends. Yet around other people or people I do not know I just do not talk, and it does not improve with time. Back when we actually went to school I would sit alone by myself bc I was too scared to sit with my friends and their friends who I did not know.  It has gotten to the point where it is making me start to hate myself more and more and fall deeper into depression.

(kind of similar to being an NPC) I had SM along with Environmental Dependency Syndrome up until about the time that I graduated high school. I do not know if there is a strong correlation with these two but I would think so. It was first written about in 1986 and is kind of the same thing as being an NPC.    \n\nInterestingly enough there is very little written about it so I may write a blog about it. But it is basically where a person seems to be controlled by their environment, so a person with it at a Drs office may feel compelled to look at newspapers.

There is so little about this that I am kind of confused if its actually recognized in medical books? How did you learn about it? Even the wikipedia article is tiny. I think it is fairly unknown, but it is in some medical books and is a recognized condition. I believe the reason why there is so little written on it is because most researchers think it is rare. I do not think this is actually the case, I think it is a lot more common than they think and that they are only noticing the extreme examples of it.    \n\nI first read about it about ten years ago or so when I was doing independent research online.", "Anyone else in their 30s?

She will talk to some children within her age group. She will whisper her answers to another six year old in class who then communicates with the teacher. I have spent the last 9 months looking for specialists to asses and provide treatment. She is on a waiting list at John Hopkins with a wait list into the year 2021. I have found multiple specialists that treat SM but none of them accept insurance. They charge $250 to $450 per one hour session. My insurance will not reimburse any amount outside of network. They recommend weekly or biweekly treatment. Is this the norm? The only way for me to afford this is to pick up extra shifts which means more time away from my daughter. Is she in school? The district should hire a specialist to support her in school. Ask about it. Push for it. Fight if you have to. It is not something that should be taken lightly. Have you considered relocating to a country with a government healthcare system? She is in a public charter school. They are overseen by the county school district. It took them 4 months to setup a meeting with me to put a 504 in place. I will push harder for their support. They have not done a single evaluation. I was not sure what resources public school systems are required to provide. My daughter is happy but I am concern for her education and future issues of depression. Ugh.. do not give up. Keep pushing. Keep asking questions. Ask other parents in the district who have a child with an IEP or a 504.

She too does not accept insurance but has reasonable rates for my income level. I have looked into camps and will consider them this summer.

I have signed up for ASL courses, and I have such huge hopes for this.", "Post-SM struggles I previously suffered from SM from the age of 9 till early 17. \n\nIt was liberating that I managed to overcome it almost 4 years back. I have never been diagnosed but I knew that I suffered from it being the kid who did not talk at all in school. I am fully recovered to the point that people I currently meet would not suspect I had a prior history of SM. I have even got a couple \" Hey, you are noisy \" statements which I actually take as a 'compliment' and a reminder of how far I have come the past 4 years.\n\nI however would not say it is all smooth roads for me ever since I overcome it. \n\nAs I would like to phrase it, I reckon that I had not had a proper childhood/social life for close to 8 years during that developmental period that I suffered from SM. In some way, I have very limited social experiences having had only 4 years up to now. There have been times where I take things too seriously, am socially awkward in certain situations and lack awareness to pick up on social cues. Consequently, it resulted into certain situations where I lost certain friendships, got sidelined when interacting in groups because of my awkwardness and missed out on certain social opportunities.\n\nI also face struggles in my friendships as well. In truth, I do not actually fancy having a large social network but more so towards a small, close knit friend group (say at most 5 or 6) that would do things together and have each other's backs - more towards quality over quantity. I do not have problems interacting with people and maintaining friendships, but it is more towards having a close 'support' friend group that I can count on. \n\nMost of the friend groups that I  initiate, people in it do not even seem committed to one another. Take for example, the friend group I formed in uni. Everyone in there seems to be there out of convenience (just for school work) and we would only do things together during the semester. Once semester breaks start, everyone would not keep in contact immediately. When I do initiate things to do together, they would always come up with reasons that they are busy or that they have plans with their other friend groups probably from high school (the latter is more common). This situation has been the same thing for literally almost every friend group I have formed after high school where the people I meet tend to be more invested in pre-existing friendship circles they have formed before, making me feel helpless and alone.\n\nMoving on to me, I do not actually have a great connection with my high school friends. We do go out at times and though I think they do not have a problem with my presence, at times I would not be invited to certain outings and it would be discussed among the inner circle of the friend group separately. The outings that I do get invited to are few and rare. I conclude that it most likely is their initial perception of me where they still think I am a little too boring (not to brag but I am doing good academic wise) and that they still see me as reserved as before - only things that me myself would know is no longer applicable to my current self having grown so much ever since I overcame SM. If only I could actually explain to them what I had suffered from previously (SM awareness is very low and I am very sure they would just have seen me as they kid who did not talk but suddenly talked), maybe they would be more accepting of me and see me in a different light than before as I have never got the chance to explain to them about my past. It is even more difficult now as the lack of social outings that I would be invited to makes it harder to pivot conversations to this hard-to-discuss-about topic (I would have to feel very comfortable to get to the point that I would want to share it).\n\nThis relates back to the previous point where I feel helpless and alone. The current friends I make, they all have strong pre-existing friendships which negates their necessity to foster deeper connections in the new friend groups they currently make. As for me, I have neither strong pre-existing friendships nor strong current friendship groups and it just pains me to see myself being so helpless and lonely at times. I have read somewhere that the strongest friendships are normally made in around childhood till high school and it makes me lose hope that I will ever be able to find a friend group that is close in the near future (will be graduating from uni very soon and no friend group that I feel where the people would be invested in the group \\*sigh\\*).\n\nI have been very off putting of engaging in certain social activities or social opportunities such as being in a relationship as I find it can be embarrassing and off putting to some people when they find out about the lack of friends I have in my social life, preferring to engage in solitude with a glimmer of hope that things would change though it looks like it would not.\n\nThis came out longer than I expected and I really appreciate it if you have read it until this point. \n\nTo my fellow post-SMers, how much would you relate to my current struggles? Any advice you would have for me? Do feel free to share about the different struggles you have faced.\n\nTo those still suffering from SM, stay strong! Take baby steps to overcoming it. I will be very glad to help you all out with any advice as I know how difficult of a journey it had been for me. How did you overcome your sm and how long did it take..? I am 17 and I cannot even talk to the majority of my own family. I had always had the desire to change it by myself and attempted it when I was presented with different opportunities where I could start fresh (changed schools twice) but still did not overcome it at that point because it is not something that you can snap out immediately. I realized one day that SM is really going to be an obstacle to my individual success and hence just one day in school, I mustered up lots of courage to attempt talking as normal and never looked back since. In short, no secret to overcoming SM. It is something that must be overcome by yourself and relates to your desire to overcome it and the environment that makes it encouraging (which I must be grateful for as not many people made a fuss when I started speaking).\n\nI would say taking small, gradual steps would actually help ease your path to overcoming SM. As mentioned in lots of people's experiences here, you can gradually start adding more people one by one to the list of people you would talk to. You can start with short replies or even whisper to them (either way were things that worked for me gradually). \n\nIt would be good if they are understanding of your condition as well. You can mention your concerns to those that you would currently talk to and maybe get them to explain to those that you would want to talk to to be understanding of your SM and not make a big fuss (eg. 'Oh you talked!') and instead allow them to treat you as how they would treat someone normally.\n\nHope it helps! Interesting... thank you!! I do not think I ever came across someone explaining so well what it felt like to grow up with selective mutism so thank you for writing this post! I would not say that I have recovered from it unfortunately but it is something that I am working on. Have you ever thought of obtaining a diagnosis (maybe not now that you are recovered)? As its still a huge problem for me I do not know if it would help to have a diagnosis and get help specially for that. I did brought up in the past few months and most of the time people have just dismissed it and said that I was just shy and needed to work on my self confidence, but I know it is deeper than that. I did move quite a lot too in the hope that eventually I would start fresh and so that people would not know that part of me but I always came back. And like you said because of that I feel like I have missed out on a lot of things and my social life suffered a lot because of it. And yes I feel ashamed to meet new people and sort of be confronted to that and have it to explain it to people.", "How to make classmates accept that I dont talk? This is my first post here so I hope I can post this here. Sorry if there are any mistakes in the text.\n\nI am diagnosed with selevtive mutism since I am 10.\n\nMy classmates dont understand why I cant hold presentations, dont say anything in groupwork or I dont say \"hi\" every morning etc.\nMy class teacher made an announcement infront of the whole class where she talked about the troubles i have with speaking (which was freaking horrible, i felt so embarrased and wanted to cry) but still they dont have any understanding for me or my situation.\n\nI dont hang out with any of my classmates in lunch breaks or anything, so I often feel very lonely (probably how many people with SM feel).\n\nGoing to school is very hard for me, I often stay at home, because of my problems.\n\nDid or do you guys have similar problems? How can I make them kind of accept my situation? I would try to let your teacher know about what selective mutism is. My wife made something for my daughter (who has SM). It was pretty much a sheet that highlighted what SM is, the best way to communicate with her etc. and a picture of when she is happy and one of when she may seem anxious. I hope this helps. Thank you so much for your reply, I think this would have been a good option when I first came to my current school but i dont think this would work now, but maybe I can use this tip somewhere in the future. Damn. It is like you share the same problem as me! I got SM when I was I was in between 10 and 11 years old. It was the start of 5th grade, new school, I just became mute from that point on. Unless someone approached me, and if I felt a good vibe with him/her, I would talk to him/her a bit more and open up to myself very very slowly. \n\nBut in all of my classes, I barely talk. The people in my classes probably think I am pissed all the time. In groups, I am supposed to talk as well with my group members. But I do not, and I do not want to come off as rude, but for them, they take it as rude, and I am sorry. \n\nI do not know if you would want to take my advice for letting your classmates know that you do not talk. But if you want then here it goes: I think you should just no smile to anyone, and do not make eye contact with  anyone. That is what I do, and I think my classmates are really normal with that now. I only talk if I necessarily *have to* like when I get called on by a teacher or a classmate asks me something. But that is about it. And also because of this SM, I do not have a single friend, which is probably why I am really depressed. The only people who understands is this SM community on Reddit. I am glad this app exists :) The internet can be such a great place to get to know people when irl you feel very alone with your problems. \n\nIn my case my class mates ignore me so not smiling etc isnt even necessary anymore. But I do the same, when a class mate askes me something I try to answer, but sometimes especially when the teacher tells me to say something I cannot speak but then I just shake my head and they move onto another person. Yes, people, classmates, and teacher would eventually get used to our muteness. That is why I agree with you on not smiling much. The internet is great for sharing your feelings", ".

This makes the strength of your feelings of hopelessness so much more intense.\n\nSchool is so difficult for anyone a bit different.\n\nMany people at school struggle to talk to people they are attracted to.\n\nLife genuinely gets easier when you leave school and have more say in your friends.\n\nAre you friends on social media? If yes, you could say hello there if you are friends. If it starts a dialogue, great. If not she is not the right person for you. Same thing happened to me. Having selective mutism and loving a person is literally the worst thing ever. But for me being in love with him and wanting to talk to him so bad made me spiral into self harm and hatred. If you are feeling this bad, as someone who is experienced it, you should get help and try to better yourself before you get to the point that I got to. plus letter is classic and romantic :)", "\"Shopping\" for a Therapist While a therapist is not a product in your supermarket trolley, never lose sight of the fact that you are the consumer and you must be discerning. The first stage is to research what is the treatment of choice for your child\u2019s difficulty.\u00a0 In the case of a child with SM and other anxiety disorders, current research points to cognitive behavior therapy as usually being the most effective treatment. Then consider the proximity of therapists, what their areas of expertise are, and ensure that they have ample experience in treating SM. Ask friends and acquaintances for recommendations, and you can also join relevant chat groups to consider others\u2019 experiences with a therapist for SM.\n\nOnce you have set up an appointment with a therapist, make sure that initially, you are interviewing her, and not the converse. Evaluate what her outlook is and which methods she employs. Is contact with the school staff and parents an integral part of her treatment? You might check where she studied and trained. Find out how much experience she has, and how successful her treatments were. You could find out what her estimation of the duration of the therapy will be. Ask her for references so that you could talk to parents whose children she has treated, and consider their recommendations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#selectivemutism #therapists #parents #children #kids r/selectivemutism nothing against you, OP, but why is it always about kids with SM? it is always advice for parents. i know that it is predominately a childhood anxiety disorder, but stuff like this frustrates me. i just wish there was this same amount of focus on adults with SM. From what i have observed, this particular subreddit is mostly populated by teen and adults searching for answers, with a smaller population of caregivers and family/friends. It makes sense because children and parents would not usually look to Reddit for this.\n\nThe answer to why lots of resources written by professionals caters to parents is honestly pretty simple. The vast majority of actual professional practices see calls from parents and caregivers. There are multiple dozens of parents calling for their children for every adult SMer that comes along, for one reason or another. So they are written for that audience. \n\nI have also seen many efforts to include older SMers in recent years, it *is* happening to some extent. Some examples, I attended the Selective Mutism Association's online conference this year. They had a track for Individuals with SM for the first time ever, and SM was always addressed in a non age specific sense. There was even examples of actual adult SMers given. There are professionals who have seen many adults.\n\nThe SM H.E.L.P. Summit this past fall also focused their theme around adults with SM. I only watched a portion of it, though.\n\nThe Outloud SM Podcast had an hour long episode just dedicated to the topic of Adults with SM with Dr. elisa-shipon blum. It was very nice. I absolutely understand you, and agree with you - it is also vital to shop for a skilled, experienced therapist if you are an adult with SM - I note your comment and will take it to heart! Let us focus on adults with SM too.", "Looking for advice on how to support my 4 year old. My 4 year old is on an IEP for communication and academics because of a speech delay. His speech pathologist at his preschool and I talked today and both think he also suffers from selective mutism. I want to be able to help him in any way I can, but the speech delay makes it hard to ask him how I can help him and to explain to him what is going on. Where should I start? I set up an intake appointment with a therapist and a psych right away after the appointment and talked to a friend who suffers from selective mutism about what he needed as a child and did not get. Other than not forcing him or making him feel bad for not talking in situations where he feels like he cannot and teaching him some sign language so he can still communicate with me or his teachers in those situations what can I do? \n\nI suffer from anxiety so I understand how he must be feeling and it breaks my heart. I have always tried my best to instill as much healthy confidence and self-esteem in him as I can and I am so worried this will affect those things. How can I make sure he feels comfortable and important and confident despite this? Any advice would be much appreciated!", "Do any of you have friends? I go to a private school where All the kids there are neurodiverse but I still cannot really talk to them with ease. I have so much to tell people but no one to tell. I have no friends that would want to talk to me and when they do I cannot answer. I have so much inside me that when I do talk, I sound like a legit crazy girl. No joke. I fell way too overprotected like I am the main character of the Truman show and people make fun of me for being clueless about the real world. Everyone thinks I am so weird but all I want is a friend who understands me properly. Can any of you relate? Yeah I have friends, most of them I made online, they are from the same Islands as I am. I made all my friends in my early 20s when I was fresh out of High School and just exploring the internet.  I do not have any friends from the people I went to school with. Yup. For the part that you have so much to say and nobody to tell it to, and when you do speak you sound crazy. That is so trueee. It is almost like it builds up inside and then you barf it out and it usually does not make sense to the other person cause it is scrambled. And as for school, people pretty much just assume you do not want to talk or you do not like them and are doing it on purpose. I am in a specialized program too so it should be easier. It really is not  I have some friends. It is mostly because I did not really start getting selective mutism until I was around 10, and I was able to keep my best friend and make a few friends through her. Most of my current friends have some form of anxiety, so they understand that talking makes me anxious and it is really hard to do, and they do not pressure me into it. I can relate. Currently in high school, obviously no friends right now due to coronavirus, makes it super difficult. But I had somewhat of a friend group in eight grade, we just felll apart when we went to high school because I only really knew one girl, and I am just boring. I hope to make some friends in college though or possibly move to a new school. There are two classmates that I sometimes study with. We are not really close and it is almost impossible, for me, to talk to them about something that is not about the thing we are studying. I actually completely understand you, sometimes when someone is talking about something that I love, I say nothing and if they ask me about this thing I tell them that I dislike it. It is quite frustrating, because I wanted to have a friend to talk with about everything. When I was at 8th grade (I guess) I had a friend that I could talk (before I had a friend like him too, but it is been a while) and we would play together and talk, It was really fun. But then he got transfered to another school and  I got quite alone. I wanted to talk with someone and be their friend. I am in the last yeah of high school by the way. \n\nI hope both of us get a friend that understands us. If you want to talk to me feel free to do so, I would love to. I only have one friend that was not already friends with my fianc\u00e9e and he is also ND so he understands which is nice Thank you I appreciate this. I guess I have to wait a little longer though. I am only in year 8 (7th grade). Most of you seem to make friends when you are older than me. not irl, but online friends are great. I consider them my best friends, you should make some :) I have two great friends that I met online about 13 years ago.  We still have not met in person but probably will someday.  In person, I do not have friends other than my boyfriend.  You know, I have never thought about it.. you just made me realize that I, too, sound like a crazy person that rambles on and on.  Anyway, in regards to having friends, I am perfectly satisfied with my current situation.\n\nMaybe you can find a local online community that shares a particular interest with you, like gaming or something.  Then you might be able to find others around your age within the same area and you guys can make plans to meet up.  Since they have already talked to you online (try to use voice chat instead of typing) they will know what to expect.\n\nYou will eventually find a friend at school or someplace else, sometimes it takes a little longer for some people. I have friends more online than real life. I consider myself to have 2 friends irl. Old post, I know. But I have none. 0 irl and 0 online\n\nI feel like an alien lmfao :( I am sorry to hear it. Hopefully you will find friends and you do not have to feel like an alien. A lot of people are out there in the same position as you but you just do not know it yet", "Help I had selective mutism in preschool I am still shy but have always had close friend and fiends my whole life \n\nI do not struggle w selective mutism anymore but I was drugged once and the next day it felt like a weight was lifted off of me. I could talk to ppl who were far away in a loud voice. The thing is I have always had this feeling over me since I was born so I do not even feel it- I only know bc this time I was drugged the next day I felt healthy and normal. Idk how to explain what is wrong but like I have always been SO AFRAID OF EVERYTHNG and skidish. Like idk I do not know what is wrong but Ik there is a solution bc I felt it once\n\nEven in therapy I remember as a 3 yr old having to walk w my therapist to ask a man for a cookie to test if the therapy worked.

I didnt talk to the people i work with for about 4 month's but i finally said a few words to a few girls and im more used to them now and can actually ask them things. But when i go out to put dishes on display sometimes people will walk up to me and ask me question and i just walk away. I cant bring myself to talk to them. I can talk online pretty easy but u usually dont respond for a around 30 minutes to a few hours. And when workers try to talk to me i just walk away and panic. I cant bring myself to talk to them. Im so glad im homeschooled now. Yeah I got yelled over by this guy from his house's window....he wanted to be able to move his boat later, but I just nodded that I cannot talk to him, and started to walk away....but he got me to stay to hear him out, I just kept nodding.....\n\nEventually I was just going to move my car, but he said not to....I could move it another time, so then I left....but I was never going back from then, and from then on it is my Dad's problem. I do not normally park where I did, I took the next chance (which was bringing my sister somewhere).....and then parked it to another spot (where we usually used to park cars), but my dad stopped parking them there because the car's got stuff on them from the tree above.......so he was asking why? And that annoyed the fuck out of me. There is a reason, can I tell you, and will I tell you? No.\n\nEven if I have what I can/could disclose to my Dad in that moment in my head, I have no motivation to want to try to tell my Dad, for me explaining something as such is just awkward and unnecessary....and I do not care enough to talk about such meaningless things.\n\nSo ofc he parks another car where I left from, later on, and whatever occurs occurs that is not my concern; I cannot do anything about it. This was a month or two ago. Yeah i can 100% relate. My bf keeps trying to talk to me and looking for responses but i just had no motivation to talk", "Success stories/Ups and Downs So, I feel pretty alone right now. I have been pushing through and going to all my school obligations, even when every fibre of being tells me to stay home. I sit in class amongst people I want to talk to (even ones I have spoken to one-on-one before), but I am just unable to do it. So I show up in class, even stay around a little longer after it is over for whatever reason, but am still not able to say anything, which could be down to a group setting in school being too overwhelming.\n\nAnd since I have been being really good at doing some of the lower anxiety things on my anxiety list, talking to a store clerk or teacher (in a one-on-one during class setting), I have realized that the more I talk the better I feel and that when I actively do not avoid (and do not \"pick and choose\" who I talk to - ie. remain mentally present in the situation), I realize I really enjoy it and things actually go all right and not the terrible mind-blanking way I imagined. \n\nI guess I want to hear if anyone has any success stories or can share anything about the processes and ups and downs you had to experience to eventually get to where you are now, even if still on the path to overcoming this. Any advice, especially for those still in their 20s and older is greatly appreciated. \n\n I went through anxiety treatment for SM in a residential setting as a teenager. I am not going to go super into detail about my childhood, but I was a pretty fearful, isolated, and suicidal kid and the anxiety only got worse throughout elementary school, middle school, and the beginning of high school. I spoke to my four direct family members and situationally a few friends and that was it. I desperately wished I was born someone who had the ability to talk like a normal person. I felt like a life of suffering had already been decided for me.\n\nFast forward to treatment. For four-and-a-half months, I spent 4 hours a day on weekdays and 2 on weekends doing exposure therapy. There were other components to residential but exposure therapy was the \"meat\" of it. It seems what you are doing is essentially exposure therapy; doing things that trigger a manageable amount of anxiety and working your way up the ladder. I hated being there at first and hated doing the exposures. I actually did come to enjoy being there, but I still kind of hate exposures. \n\nBut thanks to exposure therapy, in a few months I went from who got some anxiety from playing a silent game of cards with staff to someone who got some anxiety from *verbally* asking a random store employee for a job application. There were a million little steps between the beginning and end, and the one big leap of saying my first word to my therapist, but those little steps completely changed the course of my life for the better. There have certainly been ups and downs related to anxiety since, but the SM was as good as gone the moment I defied it and came to the realization that it was not protecting me.\n\nI did not know how much anxiety had become a part of my life and my identity until after I had overcome my SM. If you keep taking these small steps, there will be a time where it all feels like a distant nightmare. Confronting your SM is difficult and scary work, but the payoff is a lifetime of freedom from the worst of the anxiety.\n\nAnd if you ever feel stuck when trying to confront your anxiety, maybe try asking yourself: Can I force myself to do this is the next 10 minutes? (Or any specific period of time) If the answer is no, try to work on an easier challenge first. You do not need to take a big leap from talking to a teacher one-on-one to chatting it up with peers in class\u2014 try to find the \"baby steps\" in between. For example, setting a small concrete goal like asking someone if they have a pen you could borrow will be more manageable.\n\nGood luck and keep fighting the good fight!  &gt;I have realized that the more I talk the better I feel and that when I actively do not avoid (and do not \"pick and choose\" who I talk to - ie. remain mentally present in the situation), I realize I really enjoy it and things actually go all right and not the terrible mind-blanking way I imagined. \n\nThis is a good attitude to have. Ive never had SM but I have had similar \"terrible mind-blanking\" imagined situations with regards to speaking to certain people. I overcame a job interview today which was a first for me and very anxiety inducing but...it was fine. The second and third times will be easier.\n\nI am a firm believer in fakin it til you make it. Do things that the person you want to be would do. The hardest step is often the first, so do not even think about it, just do it. Once you are already rolling, you realize how manageable the situation actually is and how irrational your fears are. Overcoming any fear is a process of trying and failing again and again. Remind yourself: You are doing good. You will do better next time. Your brain is overactively imagining things. You will be okay. Everyone with anxiety needs to learn anti anxiety techniques, eg mindfulness, meditation etc.\n\nIn terms of some strategies Ive heard that have helped people...some youtubers have said that recording themselves has helped with becoming comfortable with their self image, assuring them that they do not talk or act as strange as they feel  they do. \n\nAs I read more and more stories of people with SM, I plan to collect success stories. Currently, I have plans to work through Carl Sutton's \"SM In Our Own Words\" and post my reflections here. Thank you all for sharing your stories. We think our son (4.5) may have SM or at least some form of anxiety. Hearing these stories really helps me as a parent to remember to be patient and keep up the good fight for my son.  Hello! My SM stayed pretty much consistant until I started secondary school at 11. Although being among new people was frightening, I also found that being around new people felt to me as if I had a blank slate. The kids i new before expected me never to talk. These kids did not and began trying to initiate conversations. \n\nAt around the same time my parents enrolled me in therapy (i think cbt) and i began to take an ssri (experimentally). For me the medication made much more of an improvement than the therapy. I was on it for a few years. \n\nAlthough I was known as the quiet kid up until i left school I saw improvement every year, i have learnt to deal with the feelings of anxiety and conversation skills to stay in control of scary situations. \n\nAs for downs, Even though I consider myself no longer SM i had to give a presentation and university and found the words 'stuck' and could not do it. I think that can be used as a learning oppurtuinty that every day is a step on the road to change and improvement. No one ever stops learning or gaining confidence and sometimes we take steps back, but the steps backwards only help us to learn and readjust our paths :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, from the sounds of it your doing the right thing :) Thank you for your words. I see! I can definitely now see how faking it til I make it can work, especially since I have pushed myself to do certain things. And I have heard of that tip, it does help.\n\nI look forward to reading about people's experiences with SM through those stories and reflections! Yes, a part of me wishes I could start over at a new school, but I know it is best for me to stay put and overcome this regardless. \n\nI appreciate your words, thank you. I was diagnosed with SM at 6 years old and underwent therapy and a short stint on SSRI\u2019s to get to the point where I could make headway with my anxiety. This helped so much but when I was bullied in middle school and high school it led me to retreat back into silence and depression. I struggled a lot through these years and dreaded going to school and wanted so badly to escape my classmates and start over where I would not be the shy girl. College got a lot better and I made a lot of close friendships. I always dreamed of being more social than I actually am and am still trying to love myself despite my shyness. I am persuing a second degree and still long for the friendships my classmates seem to create with ease. I have a lot of trust issues but I have gotten so much more comfortable and confident in speaking and meeting new people. I still seem to struggle with making close connections with others and it is hard not to completely shut out people who make me cautious. Today I take how I feel step by step. I try to love and accept myself for who I am and forgive myself and let it go when I \u201cembarrass\u201d myself socially. I have gone back to therapy twice when I have needed extra help. I have always felt I was a people person trapped in a selectively mute body, but this is not true. I am shy and nice and friendly and I love people but I have trust issues and anxiety and I am naturally reserved. We are all complicated and my goal is no longer to be viewed as a social butterfly but to make 6-year old me proud with all of my accomplishments as an adult.  That is great advice. I found this type of therapy so difficult as well. I was very young when doing this and I mostly remember being confused and trapped which was probably the idea to recreate my anxiety. Working through your feelings and what you can control step by step especially when in a trigger situation can help so much.  I was also put on an SSRI for treatment and though I was young I remember it making a huge difference not only in social situations but in my quality of life. I felt free even though I was not physically trapped. I do feel like SM follows you forever. I have felt myself to be \u201ccured\u201d since I was younger because I am not debilitated in the same way I once was. That being said I still face a lot of social anxiety, more than the average person. I feel the same way giving presentations in college, I do not even feel physically nervous until I hear my voice shaking uncontrollably and then I want to cry bc it reminds me I am still trying to overcome SM. The best we can do is learn from our past and love ourselves just the way we are and forgive ourselves instead of dwelling over our \u201cfaults.\u201d  I am not sure how common my experience is, but I beat selective mutism without any intervention from speech therapists, psychologists, etc. I never had a name for it until recently. I only discovered it because I had to list the various illnesses/disorders that I had as a part of the diagnostic process for ASD, and I knew I had to find a name for what I experienced because what I had gone through was not normal. \n\nFor me, I only experienced selective mutism when I was at school. People thought I was being stubborn, did not want to talk to them, just being quiet, shy, etc. I have a lot of memories of moments where I wanted to say something, but just could not because of the overwhelming amount of anxiety that I experienced. I missed out on participating in many activities in the first two years of school as a result. The first year of school was the worst, but with each year that went on, the number of people that I could talk to increased. After a few years, I would say that I could talk to approximately 80% of the people that I encountered at school (students and teachers) without any issues. It took almost 10 years before I reached the point where I could talk to anyone in spite of the anxiety that I felt. \n\nIn elementary school, I had a few friends that I was very comfortable talking to. Sometimes, they would say things to other people on my behalf because they knew that I had trouble saying it/was not comfortable talking to those people. When I finally went to middle school, I tried really hard to not rely on my friends anymore to be my voice, and that is about the time when I finally stopped experiencing selective mutism. I am not sure what led to my recovery, but I feel like many people and experiences helped me to overcome selective mutism. ", "How did/do presentations and other public speaking things go for you that you cannot get out of? How does it make you feel when you know you have to do these things? When I was in school and had a presentation, I would memorize every single word I would say, how I would say it, when I would say it. I would plan out how I moved my hands, how my facial expressions were, etc. And when I gave my presentations, I did so well and I know it shocked the class seeing me talk like that because I never spoke. But if I did not plan everything out, I stood there and did not say a word and it was so embarrassing. Forcing myself to give presentations took my energy away for the whole time leading up to it. And a little after because I would think about mine for the whole day. The second my teacher mentioned presentation coming up, my stomach sank but over time I got better at them and started to like them if I knew what I was presenting. \n\nSocratic seminars were a nightmare and I never once participated in one. I remember my first one and my best friend was very insensitive about it when I said I cannot say anything. She said it is not that hard at all just say something. I remember another time I was the only one who had not said anything and my teacher asked if I had anything to say and I physically could not. I got a 0 on it and if they knew I had something that I could not control my entire school experience would have been so much better. I always felt like it was my fault but it was not and I want to email some teachers explaining to them why I did not talk because they thought I was ignorant, and maybe it will help some other sm student in the future with accommodations. I identify with your first paragraph. Any oral exams or presentations to a group had to be written and rehearsed. Then, I could wing it. But, I was not a \u201clet us just give a speech\u201d person. All my energy drains to the point where I need down time after. I was much more successful at 1:1s. It is so crazy how in this such 'accepting world' that something like SM still cannot excuse you from something like a presentation in college (from what I have heard). I know there is a ton of ignorance on this, but it is ironic. You do not realize how much little understanding of others there really is, until your the one that needs a lot of understanding from others.\n\nIn Highschool my Mom notified my school/teachers and I never had to do presentations, BUT...in 7th grade it was Health, and the teacher was someone who was not going to be aware of my SM, so I did talk then, in front of the whole class...but it was from a script. I said it, and there really was not a reaction, but at that point in time, I was more know as 'really shy' rather than a 'mute.' That was the only time I talked since all my other teachers were aware I did not speak, so I did not....I wish that early on they were not notified of my SM.\n\nAnd also in 7th grade I had a HUGE Crush on this girl ever since I saw her in the school play, she could sing extremely well, I was willing to talk in the class I had with her which was Art...but I also was watching YouTube and taking it literally, I was told to ignore her, so I did that literally (now I know what that means...but then I did not)...Also when we were passing a ball around to say something about ourselves, I was going to but I literally could not think of anything to say....so the ball was passed on. That was it.\n\nAnd in 8th grade science class, the attendance is being called and I try to say 'here,' was not heard and I gave up on the year....never really tried to speak in school past that. My friend heard me as he told me after I tried. In highschool I never tried, I could speak to the nurse who did not know me...though I found it internally odd.\n\nNow I am in online college and have yet to speak, 3 days in...( 1 class with my brother which I will not speak in, since he is in it....so yeah)....I have not even said 'here' for attendance, I just HATE having my voice associated with my identity. So maybe I will the next day (tomorrow is with my brother, so not then).....One teacher is alright, but there is no real talking there so far, and the other kind of intimidates me (very serious)....I wish the college class was in person, because then I would have a better opportunity to talk, although much more stressful.\n\nEdit: I wish I could go back to 2012-2013 with my modern day mind, I would be such a better person socially by now. I always wanted to be prepared, but my laziness would get to me.. I hate practicing things and practicing my speeches were not... great for me. I think I did best in my French classes since no one was fluent except the teacher so there was at least some confidence that like... my classmates would not know how badly I did. Wow I am so jealous you did not have to do presentations. I would not have hated school so much if I did not have to stress about those every day. I also wish I could go back in time with my current progress and I know my life would have been so much easier if I was able to talk and make friends in middle and high school. I have never been able to give a presentation in front of a large group (although I always thought it would be fun to do that). When my teachers tried to make me, I would just stay at my desk while they pestered me that if I did not do it I would get an F on the entire assignment, even though I did the rest of the work for it. Luckily in 6th grade I got diagnoses and got a 504 plan so they could not force me to do them.\n\nThis one time in high school I was doing pretty good with speaking (I could have been on meds at the time) and I was doing a group project that had a presentation aspect of it. I thought, \"Hey, maybe I will try that out. How hard can it be?\" Big mistake. I struggled out a few sentences that were filled with uhs and then started crying in front of the whole class (and kept crying until my group finished and we could sit down again). That was pretty embarrassing. It is not presentations, but the response to them. I had to make a video with data and conclusions with a voiceover and it was horrible. But if you try and you struggle, most professors will still give you a good grade or at least take it out of the equation in grading. That is if they understand the problem. I tried to be sick those days.", "This has been the most lonely year of my life My entire childhood I had friends and in my teenage years I had a smaller more genuine group of friends and for the first two years of my twenties I atleast had people I could message on Snapchat and hope to get a response, but this year I have been completely alone, nobody responds to me.\n\nLast year I isolated properly as the law said and tried to keep up with people through social media, but it turned out none of them were actually isolating and as of this year all of those people I used to call my friends are gone, this is extremely painful for me because making new friends is almost impossible for me.\n\nI am autistic and suffer from selective mutism which would not be too bad if I looked timid and it did not clash with what people see standing infront of them but people are wierded out when someone my size kind of just stands there pretty much silently.\n\nAnd as this year comes to a close I am wondering if this is what I should expect going forward, an isolated and painful experience where the only people I see are those I work with and the people I pass in the street and at the gym.

Is anyone willing to just chat about SM as I have never actually talked to someone else with it?", "I may have S.M???? Help? I discovered this term yesterday, and it clicked a little. Maybe I am over reacting as this is a rarer disorder? \nI have never been able to describe my experience until this term came up!\n\nEver since I was small in school I could not \"use my words\". Was always extremely shy , I never went and made friends on my own. Always have had social anxiety. If I was upset or anxious I would go silent. I have been told to \"use my words\" my entire life but I cannot. When I would cry as a child my mother would ask me, I would not say a word so she would just get frustrated and leave me there. \n\nCurrently 18. I still have this issue. Whenever my boyfriend asks me a question that makes me uncomfortable it is difficult to answer. If I get upset I shut down. I lay still(pretty much frozen), and my face is blank, emotionless. I cannot speak. Sometimes I will try to gesture. He asks what is wrong and I cannot answer. I cannot physically. It genuinely feels like a firewall. I type messages when I cannot speak,. Its difficult to find the words but I can usually manage. Occasionally when I am like this I cannot do anything at all, like I am in a freeze frame. My mind goes completely blank. Could this be selective mutism?????? Desperate for answers, I have never been able to find anyone else with this problem.\n\nEdit: remembered something else I think is worth mentioning. When I saw a therapist for the first time around 15, we made little to no progress for weeks until she started to finish things for me, or guess the answer. This led to me crying and again, staying silent. She was the best therapist, I had most of my success with her. We bonded and I actually began to open up to her. Unfortunately she was a high risk therapist so I had to stop seeing her. That was the farthest I ever got in therapy I think. Definitely sounds like it. You should go see a professional, I think there is a list of specialists at the Selective Mutism Association website.  I am not an expert but your symptoms match my child\u2019s, who has been diagnosed with SM. Mind going blank is not a key factor. People with Selective Mutism can have a billion words running through their head but nothing comes out. Agreed, when mine occurs I have tons of shit I want to say (even more than I normally would) but cannot will anything out i dont have sm, but my friend does so i researched about it. I found a website about it, hope it helps.   Does your child tell you their minds go blank? How do you know what theyre thinking? I do not know what he is thinking.  But the physical description-expressionless and not responding when in an uncomfortable situation seems like him.  He is gotten a lot of specialized treatment (speech therapy and camp for SM) and he is better now.  His teachers say they do not see his SM most of the time.  The psychologists and therapists we have met with all say the non speaking is not defiance but that he physically cannot speak. Hey. I just got diagnosed with sm a year ago. I have had it since i was 4 now i am 15.\nI never talked at school, at the docter and other things.\nI just couldnt. I wasnt scared or something. Maybe at the beginning but later i just couldnt talk.\n\nIt could be sm what you have. But sm is more than just not being able to speak.\n\nIf you need any tips i am here", "Selective Mutism in certain languages? I will try my best to explain this, and wonder if anyone else can relate to this. So basically I am almost fine when it comes to English which is the language I speak in at school and online (there are times I cannot speak at all aswell but that is not the topic). I speak a different language at home, which I am fine speaking with my parents, but when it comes to speaking to anyone else in that language, I immediately cannot, no matter how hard I would like to. Even when I go back to my home country, I cannot speak to the locals in that language. So, I wanted to know if any other multilinguals feel this way haha :) I know quite a few SMers who are like this. Selective mutism is very common among bilingual/multilingual people, and like you, they are typically unable to speak the language that is not their native language, even though they want to. I am sure every case is a bit different and I am not SM myself. My 3 year old is currently undergoing diagnose (this will take several sessions and watching her in different environments).  She speaks three languages at home: Portuguese with me, German with her sister, English with her father. She speaks all three equally well. Whenever she meets someone new she may or may not speak depending on her level of comfort, but I would say that this is independent of language. In larger groups (more than 2 non-family people) she does not speak at all. In the kindergarten, not a word, and not a sound, no laughing, no crying, no coughing, no screaming. Little to no eye contact, little to no interaction, communication of yes/no exclusively by shaking and nodding her head. Lately she is been able to wave to \u201csay\u201d hello/goodbye, which I think is great.\n\nSo I am led to think that in her case it is more to do with how many people to interact with and how familiar is the environment, with the choice of language not interfering that much in her ability I speak and interact. I would say she may have an easier time in Portuguese, but that is her first language and learnt from her mom after all, and the speakers usually are somewhat warmer than the German or English speakers. On that note, it might also be difficult to set apart language and culture as a factor to facilitate communication. This was me!! I moved to america from the philippines when i was just 8. For 8 years I was sooo soo embarrassed on speaking english in the household , i couldnt bring myself to do it. It caused me A HECK TON OF PROBLEMS. Haha yea, but for me its the opposite, I cannot speak to strangers in my native language(s), but I am sorta ok with speaking english to them.  Hi sorta, I am Dad! Yo this is crazy I am also 16 years old and had SM originally cause I moved, so english is actually my second language but going back to my country and having to speak with relatives in my first language gave me really bad anxiety. I am fluent and could always speak to them when I was younger but for some reason while visiting I could only get out a few words and could not keep a conversation even if I was the one initiating it. Of course they noticed and made me feel a little bad about it. In a study, 21% of children with selective mutism were also bilingual. Good bot", "'Komi Cannot Communicate' is getting an anime adaptation    This anime is about a girl that has a communication disorder and the manga is on the ( of this subreddit I have never really watched any true Animes, but I am interested in this I have never heard of this, does the main character have selective mutism? Ah yes, I have been looking forward to this also being a mute teen in high school :) she does but it is never mentioned", "Selective mutism or autism? Hello, I have a few questions. I was diagnosed with selective mutism a couple of years ago, but I do not know if it is right. I have never gone without taking at home or at school I would always talk when asked a question or asked to read out loud. tho I have always been kind of shy a quiet. I am 26 now and what I think I have is autism because I have done my own research and I relate more to autistic traits then selective mutism traits. Aaah I have the same problem. I think in both maybe? \n\nIn the autistic community, i have heard that elf diagnosis is kind of okay, or at least saying you have symptoms of said autism. I am not a doctor or have the privilege of one, so I am not pushing anything. \n\nSo idk if it helped but it is up to you and maybe you can consult a doctor one day :) \n\nI only had pure mutism sometimes and it depends on the people, but it sometimes feels like I have no choice but to try and practice talking at school (or elsewhere) too. \n\nSo maybe both? If not, you should look into autism more as well? Thanks, I am not pushing for a diagnosis. I really do not go to out much. Socializing is very hard for me and i feel very drained afterwards. Where I live things have gone back to normal( there is no mask mandat for peoplehow are fully vaccinated). So that good at least.so I do go to school but it is a fully online school. i cannot speak to diagnostics since i am far from an expert, but autism spectrum disorder and selective mutism are often comorbid. there was a study that showed that 60% of the sample size of children with sm also fit the criteria for asd - long story short, do not rule out the possibility of both. Very interesting, im not going to rule out the possibility of both. I do know that asd and Ms can be comorbid.  But there are thing in my life that I have noticed that could possibly point to autism, like lacking eye contact, sensitive to smell, sound and  taste, I have eating habits that could seem weird, ect. I have both Selective mutism is only not being able to speak when you want to due to some source of anxiety. It is not just being quiet or shy. If you experience the desire to say something, but find yourself completely unable to even though your brain is screaming at your mouth to please open and say the thing, you have SM. Not much to diagnose there. It happens or it does not. :)\n\nAutism sounds more likely to me. If you identify with the traits, it is likely you are somewhere on the spectrum. This may be under or over the diagnostic boundary, but that does not matter if you are not searching an official diagnosis. The important thing is if knowing you may be on the spectrum helps you understand yourself and helps you find methods of functioning that work better for you. SM is the complete inability to speak due to anxiety. It can develop into a partial ability to speak, but begins as 'silence' or at most just a few forced out words like \"yes\". (Ie. If you have always been able to carry full conversations, even if difficult or upsetting, it is not SM)\n\nIts more than being shy and quiet. However having \"just\" social anxiety doesnt make the emotional distress any lesser or your symptoms any less important. \n\nAs has been said here autism and SM are often comorbid, but so is autism and social anxiety disorder. It is very common to have both at the same time", "Should I got to a sleep-away camp if I have selective mutism? So I have selective mutism but there is this sleep-away camp I kind of want to got to. It is for grades 4-12 and this is the last year I am able to go. Problem is that I know I most likely will not be able to talk or make friends. It is even more challenging to when you consider that most people will bring their friends from school, and I will probably be left out of everything. These kind of camps are usually torture if you are alone and just awkwardly present.\n\n\nI remember going to this camp when I was in 4th grade. I talked to absolutly no one, made no friends, dreded everyday of it, and wanted to go home. I could barely eat any food and did not really participate in any of the games. The cabin leaders encouraged me to join in the activities but I could not no matter how much I tired. I watched as other people made memories, while I stayed alone even though I wanted to talk and make friends so badly. I was always exhausted and just felt like crying all the time when I was there. It was easily the longest time I have gone without talking. When my parents picked me up I was happy it was over, but also extremely angry and sad that I did not talk to anyone. I ended up crying in my room, and never told my parents about the awful time I had. Now I am fearful that I will relive that experience, especially because I have not been in a social situation like school since covid started.\n\nThe only reason I am even considering going is because of the infinitesimal chance that I will talk to people and have fun. There were actually a few instances when I managed to make friends at summer camps (Not sleep-away camps) when I was in elementary school. But it only happened twice, which is barely anything considering that my parents put me in a ton of new camps every week of every summer. That was a loooooonnnnggg time ago, and now that I am older it is definity gotten even harder to talk to people. I cannot even speak at school even though I attended in person for 2 years.\n\nI Guess what I am asking is what would you guys do in my situation? Should I go to the sleep-away camp where I will most likely not speak at all, and suffer for 5 straight days and nights? There is still an infinitesimally small chance that I MIGHT have fun if I make a friend, so that is my only hope. Or I could just stay home and not need to suffer at all. If I do not go, I will still have some social opportunities when highschool resumes. Any advice you have, or have you guys ever done something similar? Is there a day camp you can attend? That way you can go home at the end of the day and decompress. It might be the best of both worlds. Or let your parents know your fears and work out a deal where you can come home early from sleep away camp if you need to. Another option is to let the camp know ahead of time that you have SM. They might be able to partner you with a buddy or make the experience better for you. Do not feel like you have to do this alone, let people know your thoughts and fears and let them help you. Thx for the advice. I never even thought about letting the camp know. I will probably try to work something out with my parents first and then maybe I can contact the camp. Not sure if there is any day camps for people my age where I live tho.", "Noelle\u2019s Journey Overcoming Selective Mutism (\n\n\nMy daughter Noelle was diagnosed with Selective Mutism which is an extreme form of Social Phobia when she was a toddler. It is a disorder known for being incredibly difficult to treat and there are very few specialists available in the United States. If improperly treated, Selective Mutism can persist into adulthood and leave a person severely disabled for their entire life. \n\nFor the first eight years of Noelle\u2019s life she only spoke with my husband and I, and two of her best girl friends. She would not speak at school. Over many yrs she worked with countless Psychologists and Therapists with little to no progress. The only specialist in this area of expertise I found was a Psychologist in Pennsylvania for $400 an hour who was treating through video chat. This would have bankrupted us! I realized as Noelle was approaching 10 yrs old that we were entering \u201cthe point of no return\u201d and this would become a permanent lifelong issue if not resolved quickly. Time was of the essence! It was at this point I decided to take matters into my own hands. I fired the Therapist who had been working were her at our home and read a half dozen books on Selective Mutism to gain more knowledge of the condition and write up a treatment plan. I felt empowered during this time and hopeful that my treatment plan would be successful. \n\nThe Summer of 2004 I worked with Noelle daily and viligiantly. All of her small steps up the social phobia ladder all added up to big leaps forward. By the end of the Summer she was calling up family members and grandparents who had never heard her voice before and conversing with them for the first time. She was now able to speak normally outside of the school setting. She however still refused to speak at school. I knew children need to be treated at both home and school separately and that this would be the biggest hurdle to overcome because she had never had a teacher that was willing to invest in helping her overcome Selective Mutism. I desperately needed the cooperation of a willing teacher. \n\nWhen Noelle started 4th grade with Ms. Henry It was obvious that we had finally met the teacher that would be able to help Noelle overcome this great obstacle. Shannon immediately took an interest in Noelle and her disability and made it her number one goal that year to get Noelle speaking in class. I provided a book about Selective Mutism the first day I met Shannon and she immediately read it and studied Selective Mutism on her own time.  Shannon and I worked together to write out a classroom treatment plan for Noelle in taking steps towards being able to talk in class. She allowed me to take videos of Noelle speaking to the class from home and show them to the students. Shannon also worked with Noelle after school with several other students throughout the year in helping her to be able to talk to them. She also came to my home on various occasions to work with Noelle. Great gains were made early on. Gradually Noelle improved over the course of the year and she eventually was able to talk inside and outside of the classroom. By the end of the year a miracle occurred and Noelle was able to give a speech in front of her class. \n\nNoelle is almost 14 years old now! She is a social butterfly and is constantly getting in trouble for socializing too much in class. She was recently voted \u201cmost popular\u201d at her school! I am sharing this story because parents need to realize the great power and ability they have to heal their children. I cannot say that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel but I think that there usually is. Love to all you parents who are fighting a great battle. Know that you are not alone \u2764\ufe0f That is awesome. My daughter is 8 and has SM.  She is been getting therapy for a few years now. It is a slow but process, but stories like this give me hope. Thank you for your story! My daughter also has SM and I am hoping to get a referral for a specialist for her. She already is getting a lot better by saying hi or bye or simply waving with a smile. A huge progress in my eyes. Your story gives me hope my daughter will also come out of her shell. It would be amazing if you could share your treatment plan for both school and at home You mention little steps.  Which I agree, add up to big bounds.  Those little steps can be hard to see day to day, but retrospect is important when looking at little steps.  \n\nWhat were some of the little steps   that In retrospect seem to have made the biggest impact in Noelles life later on?  \n\nAnd congrats.  If there is one thing I have learned it is to never underestimate the power of a determined mom. I utilized social media and Facebook to my advantage and had Noelle post little bits publicly to social media.  Like a house tour or answering questions about herself. She knew many people would see these videos and so it was part of the exposure therapy towards speaking in real time to people. Try and make things fun for the kids and like a game and then it is a positive exposure instead of a negative one. Everything was thought of in tiny social exposures up a long ladder. I remember some of the first exposures was just showing her pictures of animals and her making the sound the animal makes. Her uncle who lived nearby would come over and we would do this. It was difficult at first because she would never made a peep around him but once she got comfortable with that exposure we would move up to the next one. FaceTime is great too. You can utilize family members who are willing to volunteer their time to help. I forgot to mention the most important ingredient is reward incentives. Children need incentives and the better the incentive the more success I had! I would buy expensive dolls and anything and everything I could use to my advantage. I know this might sound a bit unethical and some therapists might disagree with my method but it was these great incentives that played the largest role in my success. I set the goals but Noelle agreed to them however. Everything was tailored to make it as fun as possible and fit her personality. I turned everything into a child\u2019s game. Or at least disguised it that way. Everything was also followed through with an incentive. The level of incentive depended on the difficulty of the task. The reason Incentives are important is because it creates a positive association with the exposure. They are necessary for success and overcoming phobias in children. ( Great to hear! I am very glad everything turned out nice! Best regards from a lot of people who went through the same stuff!", "What does elective mutism mean What does elective mutism mean", "Why was Selective Mutism removed from the Autism Spectrum? Why was it on it in the first place?  I do not ever believe it was on the autism spectrum in the DSM (I also believe autism being on a \u201cspectrum\u201d was codified in the DSM until fairly recently.   Some kids with Autism also have SM but they are not the same thing.  I remember reading that it used to be considered somewhat synonymous with/related to autism back in the 80s or something, but was then reclassified. I have also had a 'therapist' mix the two up and started to assess me as if I was on the spectrum, specifically, if I remember correctly (I was 8), Asperger's. \n\nAdmittedly this 'therapist' was about as qualified as someone who bought a $20 degree online. When I read about it having been on the spectrum, I thought maybe she had been taught or only followed outdated diagnoses and treatments. \n\nBTW, we left that fraud after she tried to put me on a dose of meds that would be too high for an adult let alone a third grader, so her using outdated information is not that hard to believe.  Sensory Processing Disorder is very common with SM and I think it has been moved on and off the autism spectrum definition. SM is not considered a part of the autism spectrum, but it would be incorrect to say they are completely unconnected. I was diagnosed with ASD (at the time Asperger's syndrome) as a preteen while in therapy for selective mutism.\n\nI do not have a source for her information, but in the book *Spectrum Women*, Dr. Michelle Garnett makes this statement when talking about diagnosis in girls with ASD.\n\n&gt;\"The initial diagnosis of a different condition, particularly social anxiety, attention-deficit disorder (ADD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), **selective mutism**, depression including bipolar disorder, gender dysphoria, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or anorexia nervosa\u2014this is a common pathway for adolescent girls.\"\n\nBased on this quote, I imagine my experience is not uncommon. It is a myth that you cannot have both. Maybe some will choose not to diagnose both, but it is possible and my personal diagnostic history reflects this fact.\n\nPlus, anxiety disorders are more common is people with ASD, so it would follow that SM is as well. A 2011 study (( put the anxiety comorbidity rate in people with ASD at 40%, but different studies have put the number anywhere from 11% to 84%. ((\n\nA 1995 study (( found that 7.4% of people with SM met the criteria for Asperger's, while only 0.3% of the general population did. However, Asperger's is not considered seperate from ASD anymore because of lack of evidence of distinct autism subtypes, and the way we define autism and diagnostic rates has changed, so those numbers might look slightly different today.\n\nA 2017 study (( showed 63% of people with SM met the criteria for ASD, while a further 20% had subclinical autistic traits. However, this likely reflects the population of this clinic the study was done through, which was known for its expertise in ASD.\n\n**In summary: The research is limited, but points to a connection in some cases.**", "I think I used to have selective mutism while growing up? So I have known that I had social anxiety since primary school for a long time now, although I never actually started getting help for it till late high school. I was just watching the Big Bang Theory though and heard about selective mutism for the first time. I searched up the signs and symptoms and everything seems to make sense to me...\n\n\nI remember being EXTREMELY shy as a toddler. My teacher (in daycare) would ask me a question and I would just straight up not respond at all, and I would not speak to a single person there. I even peed my pants one time because I could not bring myself to tell her that I needed to go to the bathroom (I would usually just wait till I was home, but this time I just could not hold it in any longer I guess). I never actually got help for it though and my teachers never seemed to raise any alarms with my parents, as far as I am aware. I just eventually started forcing myself to talk as I got older I guess?!?!\n\n\nI am 24 now and still have pretty bad social anxiety to this day. I have seen a few psychologists, but I have never really found them useful as I can never really being myself to talk about my feelings to them no matter how hard I try. I actually only told my mum about my anxiety today during a fight. She was apologising for neglecting me while growing up and said that my older brother needed more attention than me as he is been on medication for anxiety since he was 5, and I kind of just blurted out \u201cwell if you paid any attention to me you would know I had bad anxiety while growing up too\u201d. I am not sure what kind of anxiety my brother has, but he definitely liked talking about all his feelings to my mum while growing up, whereas I have always been very closed off with my feelings. Childhood anxiety definitely seems to run in the family though \ud83d\ude2a\n\n\nDoes this actually sound like selective mutism though?? And how can I get help for my anxiety if I cannot seem to open up to psychologists? I have been taking medication from my GP though and it seems to have helped a little, but definitely not enough. Sorry this is so long but I feel lost and do not really know what to do from here. TIA Why am I getting downvotes though \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I have had a lot of success with writing to my therapists or sending them articles on issues I can relate to. I email her when I have something on my mind and explain it the best I can, and tell her I am not comfortable discussing yet. Then it is on her radar even if I cannot bring it up. I would even email her this post if I were you.\n\nNo one here can tell you if you had selective mutism, which might be reason for the downvotes, but ignore them. Having a diagnosis is not as important as understanding yourself. Thank you so much! I will definitely take that idea on board as soon as I find myself a therapist. Much appreciated \u263a\ufe0f", "Dating Someone with SM So I do not have mutism myself, but I did grow up with severe social anxiety (and possibly had SM as a kid but was never diagnosed) so I feel like I have a slight understanding of what it is like.\n\nI have never really encountered anyone with it before and I am now dating someone who has it. We have been together just under a year (long distance/online) and I am not sure what I can do to help or support. The only way we can really spend time together is by texting, but that can be a bit draining on both of us at times. We have done video calls before but they never last long because I am the only one speaking, (while he types) and I eventually get uncomfortable and want to end the call.\n\nI guess I am just looking for some advice on what we can do better. If you were in a relationship that was long distance a majority of the time, what are ways you would want to spend time with your partner? Sounds tough, but im glad you are not writing off the other person because of their SM. I was diagnosed as a kid, but I mostly grew out of it because I had such great support, so I may not be the best person to answer, but I will try.\n\nStart a hobby that you will both engage in, either together or separately, so that you have a reason to converse and talk about things. A book club is great, if you both like to read. Or scheduled movie nights. A cooperative video game would work great, too. Make it a point to confirm that the session can be skipped if either of you is not feeling up to it, with (hopefully) no judgment. \n\nCode words. Or words that are not codes but are always taken seriously. Say, one of you is not up to talk for a while. Make it a point that one of you can text the other saying something like \"not for 3 hours\" or \"not for 1 day\", which could mean that you are not available/you do not want to talk for that amount of time. Setting boundaries, especially when you both have some sort of social barrier, will ensure that you are not stepping on each others toes. Just make sure you clear it with them before you start adopting this technique.\n\nOffer reassurance. Eventually you will have to have a \"we need to talk\" or \"I need to call you\" moment, whether it be something major or just talking about something crazy that happened to you, but regardless, preface those moments with reassurance. Instead of saying either of those, which are immediately alarming to receive, say \"I need to talk to you about...\" or \"I need to call you, nothing to be worried about, its just too long to type.\" If anything can be misconstrued, especially when you have a social barrier like SM or social anxiety, I speak from experience when I say those extra words that calm the immediate gut reaction of worry will become so valuable in the long run.\n\nPictures are great because they can be viewed at any time, but they are more personal than a text. Take pictures of your breakfast, of dogs you see, of a weird bug that flew into your room, of an the sunset outside your window. Its a connection that brings them into your world, and if they do the same, then it works the other way, too.\n\nShare a playlist that you can both add to. Share a pinterest board that you can both add to. Collaborate on something that you can create together, even if its all digital.\n\nAnd for my grand finale, a few phrases that I think everyone should be able to say for any relationship, so feel free to use these if a time ever comes:\n\n\"Do you want to talk about it, or be distracted from it?\"\n\n\"Should I listen, offer advice, or just sympathize?\"\n\n\"Are you in the right mental space for me to vent right now?\"\n\nGood luck! I am sure most of what I have said is something you already know, but if its not, I hope it helps! I was a bit hesitant to post this, but I will anyways because it is good to hear different perspectives. But apologies in advance for this comment if it is completely unwanted. And I am not suggesting you should do the same as me, because some other path may work out better in your individual situation. This is just what happened to me and how I reacted to it. \n\nI was mute for many years. During this time, I got my first girlfriend. We texted all the time, and I would see her at school where we would just be silly and have fun together without needing to speak. In the end though, I got dumped by her because she could not cope with the mutism thing anymore. Very sad at the time, but looking back, I am very grateful that she did that to me. My parents had tried to get me professional help for years, but I always rejected it. For me, being dumped because of my mutism gave me the impetus to accept professional help, and ultimately overcome my mutism altogether. So in the long run, it was a great thing and we both went on and found love elsewhere. I am glad that experience helped you, as tough as that might have been. My partner really does want professional help but really is not in a position to be able to see anyone (financially, family stuff, etc) but I am trying to be as patient as I can without doing too much. I know not to be pushy about anything and just want to do what I can to make it easier. \n\nEven after telling my parents about him and his mutism I got very defensive about him bc my mom started up about \"is that something you really want to deal with/put yourself through?\" like yes, absolutely. If the person is meant to be, then why would something like that hold me back from loving them? Those three phrases are amazing. Thanks for the wisdom. Your parents make a totally sensible point. Perhaps there is a long road ahead in overcoming the mutism. For me, it was years of therapy. In the meantime, it is unlikely you will help them speak, but maybe you can make them comfortable. A patient soul is indeed required. There are plenty of people in the world with whom you can share love with, and potentially these people have much more straightforward lives. Hard to believe it when you are in love with someone right now, but it is true. So why put yourself through this? Nothing wrong with exploring the question. It helps to probe at infatuations, or observe how many available people there are out there. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone has some kind of flaw. You could give up someone with mutism, only to risk finding yourself with someone else with their own set of problems which are more bothersome. I do not know the details of your conversation with your parents, but perhaps they did not balance things out by telling you that. So do you choose hope or experience?", "I do not really understand what I am supposed to do anymore I am told to find a way to occupy my time and that I need to leave the house. When I try to go to events and hold conversations with people I have meltdowns because it is so stress inducing for me. I really do not understand what I am supposed to do. I feel like I can not win. \u2639\ufe0f", "Can you have a mild form of selective mutism Hello,\n\nI am 24 and had the realization that a lot of the symptoms applied to me when I was younger. I was always very chatty at home with my parents and when I spoke to a couple of friends outside of school. But I was never completely mute and feel like i am fairly functional now.\n\nIn school I could speak when asked a direct question with a short sentence or two. And could talk one on one to a handful of people. In groups I felt like I could not speak  i.e. in the play ground I would just stand and listen sometimes smile and occasionally laugh. It would not be unusual if I spoke maybe 30 seconds over several school days certain at periods. \n\nIn later years I would be able to give short presentations with others but I mainly just joked about how bad my presentation part was. I do not think I ever asked a question in class until 17-18. \n\nI was not able to take the bus until I was about 17 I would walk an hour and half instead of getting a 30 minute bus when I had too. I would not be able to buy stuff at shops either. Later on I would skip lunch and avoid people as I felt friends were only hanging out with out of pity and felt like I was lowering  their social standing. I have never asked for directions from strangers. I did not have any friends on my course at uni until 4th year but made good friends with my housemates. Telephone calls sometimes still freak me out. I have to take a few minutes of deep breathing to talk to clients at work I have not spoken to before. And I have not been able to book any hospital appointments despite logically knowing I should.\n\nReading about this yesterday has started to make a lot of sense of why I have never had a girlfriend and why I have always felt different and absence in group situations . For a long time I thought I was just stupid and lazy.\n\nSorry this became a unorganized spew of consciousness. It feels good to share my thoughts anonymously. I am in no way an expert or professional but your selective mutism as a child does seem less severe. It might have been like in between selective mutism and general anxiety disorder. If you feel like it was a mild version/experience of sm then do not worry to interpret it that way :) I think I always sort of  knew I had anxiety but my symptoms did not line up with that disorder. \n\nThe prototypical SM seems to be significantly more severe than what I experienced but seems to line up almost perfectly.  I suppose everything is on a spectrum. I am sure I would have been diagnosed with something but I was quite good at telling school therapist / parents what they wanted to hear. \n\nI think at this point it does not really matter but allows me to look back more positively on my past. I really feel for the people who had it worse than me in this forum must have been terrible :( Definitely. SM is recognized to have a spectrum. The SMart center (Selective mutism, Anxiety and Related disorders Treatment center) actually made a \u201cbridge\u201d to demonstrate it. In case you have not seen it: \n\nFor most of my childhood I had mild SM. It is not uncommon. I am 27 and had selective mutism as a child. It is pretty common to grow out of. I was not selectively mute as a teenager but I was still incredibly shy and quiet and refused to do anything new. \nAs an adult I still do not like to go to places I have never been but I would say I am pretty talkative now. When I get anxious or stressed I still find it hard to find words. I prefer to be quiet and if I have to talk I feel like I stumble over my tongue. Ah ok, thank you. Looks like I was 3. 1a for a long time. Yeah if I talk to people I do not know well I often stumble over words to this day. What did you do to become more talkative as an adult? I put myself in situations where I need to talk. I think my first job really helped me move from somewhat mute to shy. Once I got past that hump I was okay. Now I would not even describe myself as shy, but I am quiet. I definitely do not make as many non verbal cues as many people do.", "Who/what determines if you have recovered from SM? I was just wondering because I see some people on here are recovered SM. I would say when you can speak freely in all settings, situations, and to anyone in them. Once you are recovered typically you will still have residual social anxiety though. So it is like self determined? I cannot really tell if I am recovered or not because I am not in a school setting where I need to present to a bunch or people but I am doing okay at my part time job talking to strangers. If there is still times where you physically cannot speak or struggle to get out many words, I would say you are not recovered yet, though you could say you are mostly recovered True, I was not sure if that was considered general social anxiety or part of SM because I definitely have times where I cannot speak even to someone I usually talk to. It would definitely be classified as SM if you physically cannot speak. That is really the only difference between SM and social anxiety Good to know, thank you!! :) Usually when you feel you are social enough for yourself. As in, not to the point you do not talk at all or talk too much just a balance. You will start to notice when you are less anxious in social situations. That is a good explanation. So you do not have to go to the psychiatrist or something to know if you are cured? Not that I am aware of, no.", "Do you think games like IMVU can help me a bit socially? I used to be able to talk to people online but now i am too shy to do that anymore. I never can even start conversations online and i am so lonely. Honestly yes. in the sense that SM can be very isolating and i find even online socialisation beneficial to feel less alone.\n Yep! Do it! Honestly anything that makes you feel sane, is something that you should pursue. No matter how socially anxious we are, humans need to be social. That said, some people (like me or you) it is really hard and so we have to turn to other ways while we recover. That is completely valid.", "is sm &amp; dating even possible? its just i used to never even mention my anxiety to guys i mean i was diagnosed at 10 but did not find out till i felt a connection to world of dance cuz i never knew what sm was i guess but i would get dropped by guys after meeting them bc they always would say i am too awkward. first hearing about sm was during my first relationship &amp; after 2-3 months i was single again i think its bc of my anxiety but idk that was july 2019 &amp; i still am single. it seems that if i mention my anxiety i get dropped but ots not like im going to humiliate myself again by letting them find out when i can barley talk &amp; i get that we are in a pandemic i havent seen anyone i dont live with in months but like idk &amp; idk why it makes me so upset i guess just the fact that im almost 20 &amp; still felt so awkward around my ex at the end &amp; so many guys ask me to hookup but ik i cant with my anxiety &amp; sometimes dont know if me thinking im demisexual is just my anxiety or bc i actually am I am not sure, but mildly hopeful. Try to think up some good non talking first dates, way before the chance comes up, just so you have some in mind. Like seeing a movie, visiting a museum, dancing, theme park, zoo.\n\nThen tell the person as early as possible that you are selectively mute, being quiet does not mean you are not interested, it is just seriously hard to talk sometimes, especially when it is important, so especially on dates. Maybe initiate texting while you are together? I have not tried that yet. So... dating actually helped me because it allowed me to practice talking with others. At the same time I also started blues dancing and fell in love. Where I used to go, it was normal to introduce and chit chat so that was another Avenue of practice.\n\nI had a few atrocious dates, but by the end of it (got married) I would say I was pretty good at it.\n\nWhat helped me was having standard conversation guides. Like: hello, get to know the other person, share interests, find common ground. i have never been on an actual date but idk just feels like no one can understand my anxiety bc i thought my ex could cuz he also had shit going on but my anxiety was still the problem Yes, it is! I have been in a wonderful relationship for a good three years and I can PROMISE you the key is getting someone who understands. It can be hard sometimes, but it isnt anywhere near impossible. It is not easy, but possible and super wonderful if it happens!\n\nIt is important to tell your partner quite early about what selective mutism is, that being quiet does not mean that you are not interested. Eventually you will find someone who understands. It get's better, trust me. Even if you get hurt, you get a bit stronger each time.\n\nIt takes time, try to work on yourself and the rest will come on it is own! :) Look, a lot of people were not interested in me because I struggled so at first. But it is part of the process of practicing and building the skill and getting better. You will fail quite a bit. In fact, success is not possibly without multiple failures. You are trying to build a new muscle memory in your brain of sorts.\n\nAND 99.9% of people will not get it. It is completely outside of their norm, that is okay. You are the one with experience with this so it will fall on you to eventually communicate and teach about the problem even though that seems back-asswards, but you do not need to worry about that or bring it up unless you want to.\n\nDo not worry about that so much as practicing for yourself. Do not worry about every date possibly being the one that you missed out on cause you could not talk. \n\nDating is about meeting other people you might want to be friends with. I went on a lot of first dates and very few second dates. \n\nYou will meet some people who will probably let pressure you into hooking up, and if you do not want to that is fine! Try to be clear about that from the get go, tho ime some people just push and push to see how far they can get, which is why I always meet in safe places and rely on myself for getting places. Other wise sometimes you have to be very stern with some jackasses.\n\nI know pandemic is not going on, but once it is over if you enjoy dancing at all I would highly encourage partner dancing because it sets you up to practice talking with people. If you do do this, you can also practice going up and asking (I would ask every single person to dance that showed up in the beginning (I really like dancing) and get my practice in that way). I am also almost twenty and have not dated in a few years. I have dated 3 people in the past and me being quiet/socially awkward was never a problem for any of them.\n\nIn my most successful relationship, I started out where I could not even look at the guy when talking to him. But we would hang out for a few minutes after school (he was friends with my friend bf) and we spent a lot time messaging each other over summer break. When school started we dated for 2-4 months and I was able to be pretty much normal around him.\n\nYou just have to know it will take time to feel normal being around someone; a lot more time than for people without SM. And also that having anxiety is not a deal breaker for some; you just have to find someone who is kind and considerate.", "How would I go about writing a character with selective mutism? I have been researching it quite a bit, but I thought I would ask here just to make sure I do not get anything wrong or accidentally disrespect anyone. \n\nMy general idea is that the character will only be able to speak around her aunt and uncle (who raised her) and later on, her boyfriend.\n\nI wanted to ask, are there any particular ways she might act other than being shy or withdrawn? Are there any common stereotypes I should stay away from?\n\nPlease also let me know if there is anything else I should keep in mind. Thank you. At least for me I had a lot of pent up anger inside me It is a spectrum, I would never describe myself as shy and I hate when people do. I am just a person with a lot of anxiety that causes me to not be able to say what I want to.\n\n\nAnxious, frustrated, a whirlwind of emotions but it does not show on my face, observant, these are some of the ways I describe myself. That makes sense, and I am sorry you have to deal with that. I will try and integrate these sorts of things into her character. She has to deal with a few traumatic events especially near the beginning of the story that are not related to her mutism, so she is probably going to be feeling these emotions anyway. you should remember that even if your character can speak with someone normally, that can go away completely while in public, so if they need to speak while out they should find somewhere they can be completely alone, and even then she might still be nervous about somone coming by, so she would still struggle to speak as much as she would at home.\n\nshe might also be able to whisper in a trusted persons ear to communicate while in front of people, but for me this was pretty humiliating so i tried not to do it unless what i had to say was really important\n\nalso, a mutism attack is likely to happen any time the person is feeling extreme pressure to do something, even around trusted people. if she is being pressured to make a decision, speak, move, etc., she would freeze up and sometimes struggle to even move. the reaction is not always logical, and you cannot talk someone out of an episode. the fastest way to get someone out of a frozen state is to give them space, time, and reassurance. This is really helpful and I will definitely take this into consideration while writing her. I did already research your first paragraph and know that, so I am glad I got that right.\n\nThis story is set where she will be outside and away from home most of the time, however there usually will not be any people with her except for her friends and family. My main character is someone she is friends with but she still cannot speak to, and since it is always from my MC\u2019s perspective, my MC will probably never hear her speak.\n\nYour last paragraph is definitely an important note I will write down, and will include in the plot at certain points where there is pressure or tension.\n\nThank you, this has definitely helped me get an idea of how to more accurately write her :) A very short comment but hopefully still helpful. For many of us, the inability to speak is a very physical feeling/experience. Like tightness in chest/lungs, feeling throat closing etc. Not all of us, but many.\nGood luck on your writing journey!\nSorry for my nad english. That is definitely something I will think about when writing her, thank you! Your English is fine btw lol (English is not my first language, I hope it is understandable)\n\nThink about what the \"selective\" means. That means that it could be certain situations, like not being able to speak to multiple people at once/ holding a presentation, or perhaps the opposite gender is affected. The older the person, the easier I felt like I could open up.\n\nYou picked that it is her most trusted people, which usually works. There could still be situations where she cannot speak even to them, like if it gets very personal or she is in a lot of stress in general. I used to tense up heavily if it was about my own emotions or relationships and being confronted about them.\n\nAdditionally, Selective mutes tend to have a lot of energy when around trusted ones/family, as if to make up for being silent otherwise.\n\nTemper Tantrums can also happen (For me it was when things I knew I could do very well just did not work out, like loosing in a video game I was good at). They died down with a certain age for me though.\n\nThink about what caused it perhaps too. Many experience some sort of trauma while young, some have it since birth (I for example).\n\nAnd of course, she can grow out of it, with or without help. It can go a lot of ways!\n\nHave fun writing and I hope I was of a bit of help! Being shy can be a character trait as much as on any other person, when my sm was its worst I was still very active to interact with people. I was your normal less than 4-year-old who just did not speak to anyone. I loved showing off my block buildings. Heck, the people I was closest to had learned to speak for me. That is a structure that makes healing sm more difficult and needs to be stopped for healing to be possible, but gets constructed in a lot of relationships between fully verbal and sm people. Especially people that have known the sm person for years. They just know the things you like through your actions and the things you have chosen in the past and think they are helping you by talking for you. Case study: Raj from the Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of a person living with selective mutism, minus the alcohol. As a (mostly) recovered selective mute with a selectively mute younger sister, these are the first things I can come up with:\n\nYour character might have alternative methods to communication, like carrying around sticky notes and a pencil (I used to do this in elementary school) to write on when need be or texting people even if they are nearby (my sister and I are both uncomfortable interacting face-to-face although we live together, so we text instead, and I text my mom who I also live with because I do not have much of a relationship with her even though talking to her should be as easy as yelling down the stairs). I have heard of SMs using sign language, too, but my sister and I never learned that so we just use(d) written/typed communication.\n\nFrom personal experience, she might also have certain words she cannot say, even if it is to someone she trusts enough to talk to. For me, these are \u201cimportant\u201d words. \u201cSorry,\u201d \u201cthank you,\u201d \u201cplease,\u201d \u201cno problem,\u201d \u201cyou are welcome,\u201d and so on are words I tend to trip up on, even though I can otherwise talk normally. When this happens, I can force myself to get the words out as that is how I learned to start talking, but my voice gets a lot quieter and I half-mumble it because it just feels so weird to say it.\n\nIf your character does not have a good relationship with anyone else in her family or her relationship with family members deteriorates over time, it is possible for her to become selectively mute toward them even if they once had a good relationship. This is why I do not interact with my sister in person and I avoid in-person interaction with my mom as much as possible, although I used to talk to them and interact with them. My sister is the same way toward me and my mom, though she still spoke to my mom up until maybe a couple months to a year ago. I think she realized how bad of a parent my mom is at that point and withdrew herself.\n\nAnger is a strong ass emotion. In our cases, anger and annoyance are enough to get us to speak up. For me, it is with my dad. I gray-rock him for as long as I can control my (usually nonexistent) temper and I give him the silent treatment, but when he pushes my buttons a little too hard, I can blow up and start screaming at him. Happened just yesterday. But right after that, I usually go right back to gray-rocking and complete silence because that temper comes from him. For my sister, she gets annoyed when people refer to her as my sister instead of her name, since I am older. She is spoken up in school, where I believe she is entirely mute otherwise, to snap at people about how she has a name (and honestly I am very proud of her for it).\n\nI am sure you already know this from your research, but as far as I am aware, SM can develop at any time. My sister and I were selectively mute before we even started school because we dealt with our parents fighting since we were far too young and we have been emotionally neglected for just as long, so we pretty much grew up selectively mute. But IIRC, I have read about experiences here from people whose mutism developed over time where they withdrew from the people around them and just stopped talking to people.\n\nIt is also highly likely for your character to be taken advantage of, pushed around, left out, etc. because she does not have a voice. Having a voice makes a *huge* difference. When you do not have one, you cannot say no, or tell people to stop doing something, or ask for help, or anything else. You cannot talk to your friends until you know them well enough to be able to break through the barrier of mutism stopping you and god forbid you want to talk to classmates or strangers or family members you do not like. This leads to a *lot* of alienation, likely bullying, and just general exclusion. I have always been considered \u201cthe smart kid\u201d in school so in elementary, when I could not talk, people would constantly copy off of me without even asking because they knew I could not say no. It is also hard to make friends because nobody wants to be friends with someone who will not even talk to them. Some people go as far as taking personal offense to it, thinking you are just being rude on purpose to them because they do not understand why you do not talk. It is, of course, possible to make friends, it will just be difficult if they do not make the first move and put in a little more effort than usual. I was mostly friends with extroverts who were happy to put more effort into the friendship to make up for what I could not do, but my best friend was an introvert because we were more similar and although I could not talk to her, it was nice to have someone who I could stay with at social gatherings so I did not have to be alone while I did not talk to anyone. Now that I talk and am more outgoing, though, my best friend is an extrovert who helps me do social things and because I do not have many social skills from a childhood of not needing them, I made many of my friends through her.\n\nBecause not talking often leads to exclusion, it is likely your character might have something they invest their time in instead, possibly as a method of escapism. For me, that was books and video games because they told stories that helped me forget my own life. Since I started talking, though, I actually grew out of both because now, I do not need a distraction from my life because I am fairly happy with it.\n\nYour character might also be forced to talk to some people. My sister and I talked to our teachers when we absolutely had to, but both of us spoke in a soft, higher-pitched voice than our usual voices because we were not comfortable using our real voices. I always hated talking to teachers, but now I am working on that fear. I am not sure why we actually spoke to teachers instead of that pressure making us even more mute out of stress, but that is how we were. (Or, are, because my sister is still that way.)\n\nThat is all I can think of off the top of my head. Feel free to ask any more specific questions if you would like input from a recovered SM or what I know about my still-SM sister! Thank you, this is really helpful, and most of the stuff you said would actually work with her character. She will probably have it either since birth or have it something to do with her mother\u2019s death, which I will think about.\n\nThanks! This is something I was actually thinking of doing, as she was raised by her aunt who might be able to speak for her sometimes. Thank you! Thank you, this is very useful info!\n\nI was planning on having her write notes with some form of notepad, but they are in a situation where they will need to leave a place very quickly and will not have time to get a notepad (I would elaborate on this but instead I am just going to say there is pretty much no way she could have access to a pen/paper for at least the first part of the book, and my world is set in a time period without phones). She might be able to get one a little bit later.\n\nI have never heard about the not being able to say specific words, actually, but I will definitely take that into consideration! That could definitely be a thing that comes up. My story is very character-focused so even smaller aspects of her mutism like this are relevant.\n\nShe has always had a good relationship with her auntie May who raised her, but her relationship with her uncle Bradley has actually deteriorated so her becoming selectively mute towards him is not a stretch at all.\n\nI am torn between her being mute from birth and being mute from her mother\u2019s death, which I will probably decide based on how the story plays out.\n\nThere are a couple boisterous or overwhelming characters in my story (especially Finley, Zoe and Erin) who will most likely overwhelm her or accidentally put too much pressure on her. They probably will not take advantage of her as such but there will definitely be times they accidentally leave her out or make her uncomfortable. She is very much forced into a situation where she is with them all the time from near the beginning of the story, which she does not even want, but I was not planning on her having many (or even any) friends before she was put into that situation. This is also the reason I am taking mutism attacks into consideration - the events in the book will throw her into quite a few new and maybe terrifying scenarios.\n\nI was planning on having her do drawing and possibly books before I thought of the idea to have her be mute, so that could also be her way of escapism, however she will not be able to do either of those things right at the start due to specific circumstances. That will be a thing she is able to do when the characters do acquire pens/pencils/paper.\n\nThanks for your comment :) i agree with what a few people here have said, i am not a shy person, i just have trouble speaking because of anxiety. selective mutism is different for everyone, but your character most likely cannot speak to even safe people in public most of the time. i personally write notes when i need to say something and am unable to, make sure if your character needs to say something to someone in public that they either find a safe space to speak or have another form of communicating. good luck! Thank you, this makes a lot of sense and I will definitely think about this when writing her. I was planning on having her be fairly shy anyway, unrelated to her mutism, so that is a separate character trait, but thanks for your input - I did not want to fall into any stereotypes.\n\n(By the way, I love your username) One note, there is a difference between selective mutism and traumatic mutism in terms of why/how it develops. SM is generally only the diagnosis when there is not a clear traumatic cause. The reason I point this out is that the recovery paths tend to be fairly different and have different considerations. Just from a stereotype point of view, if you want to use the term Selective Mutism, please do not give her a traumatic backstory with one **'big event that caused her to go mute**'. SM is not very well understood by the public and it does not help to have people thinking that it is always caused by trauma, when it is more linked to temperament. People with SM do not need to read that they are broken because they are not and parents do not need to feel they are to blame. Traumatic mutism is also totally a thing, but it is a different thing (according to DSM-5).\n\nOther notes are that some people with SM can be very very talkative when they are comfortable. For me after a day of silence at school, coming home was like a dam busting sometimes. The worse my day was the more I talked at home. \n\nThe situations that people cannot speak in are not always logical. I could speak to people that I would never have to speak to again, but I could not speak to anyone that I knew I would have to spend more time with in the future. There is also huge variation, for me adults were generally ok (outside of school), but others my own age were terrifying. But for others adults are the problem. \n\nNames are another huge trigger for quite a few people with SM. If I had to call someone by their name, even if I was 99% sure I knew it, I could not speak as it felt safer to stay silent than get their name wrong. \n\nAlso, SM affects how other people act around the person with SM. People get used to someone being silent surprisingly quickly. During recovery, they rarely leave space for someone with SM to speak, especially as kids/teens. \n\nSM can also extend to other forms of communication. I could not text or write notes to people who I could not talk to. The anxiety was just as high, if not higher! But some people with SM can use alternative methods. Thank you for letting me know this, I will probably avoid having the cause be her mother\u2019s death because of this - this definitely makes sense. I am glad you told me this actually, as I wanted to be able to include a diverse range of people without falling into stereotypes for them, and that includes this character.\n\nI find it really interesting to hear about the differences between the experiences of people on this subreddit, and I will definitely add yours to my notes. I want to be able to shape her character to be individual, but also not offensive or misleading, so hopefully I will do an ok job on that point.\n\nThank you for your response :) aww thank you i love yours too \ud83e\udd70 Personally me and several other people i have spoken to in the past respectfully disagree. Raj is used as a joke on the show and is only unable to talk to women, not men. His SM is temporarily cured in one episode by dating a woman, his infantilisation is supported by the narrative and characters such as penny are treated as correct for the flippant way in which they treat him", "Noelle\u2019s Story Part 1 My daughter Noelle was diagnosed with Selective Mutism which is an extreme form of Social Phobia when she was a toddler. It is a disorder known for being incredibly difficult to treat and there are very few specialists available in the United States. If improperly treated, Selective Mutism can persist into adulthood and leave a person severely disabled for their entire life. For the first eight years of Noelle\u2019s life she only spoke with my husband and I, and two of her best girl friends. She would not speak at school. Over many yrs she worked with countless Psychologists and Therapists with little to no progress. The only specialist in this area of expertise I found was a Psychologist in Pennsylvania for $400 an hour who was treating through video chat. This would have bankrupted us! I realized as Noelle was approaching 10 yrs old that we were entering \u201cthe point of no return\u201d and this would become a permanent lifelong issue if not resolved quickly. Time was of the essence! It was at this point I decided to take matters into my own hands. I fired the Therapist who had been working were her at our home and read a half dozen books on Selective Mutism to gain more knowledge of the condition and write up a treatment plan. I felt empowered during this time and hopeful that my treatment plan would be successful. The Summer of 2004 I worked with Noelle daily and viligiantly. All of her small steps up the social phobia ladder all added up to big leaps forward. By the end of the Summer she was calling up family members and grandparents who had never heard her voice before and conversing with them for the first time. She was now able to speak normally outside of the school setting. She however still refused to speak at school. I knew children need to be treated at both home and school separately and that this would be the biggest hurdle to overcome because she had never had a teacher that was willing to invest in helping her overcome Selective Mutism. I desperately needed the cooperation of a willing teacher. When Noelle started 4th grade with Ms. Henry It was obvious that we had finally met the teacher that would be able to help Noelle overcome this great obstacle. Shannon immediately took an interest in Noelle and her disability and made it her number one goal that year to get Noelle speaking in class. I provided a book about Selective Mutism the first day I met Shannon and she immediately read it and studied Selective Mutism on her own time.  Shannon and I worked together to write out a classroom treatment plan for Noelle in taking steps towards being able to talk in class. She allowed me to take videos of Noelle speaking to the class from home and show them to the students. Shannon also worked with Noelle after school with several other students throughout the year in helping her to be able to talk to them. She also came to my home on various occasions to work with Noelle. Great gains were made early on. Gradually Noelle improved over the course of the year and she eventually was able to talk inside and outside of the classroom. By the end of the year a miracle occurred and Noelle was able to give a speech in front of her class. Noelle is almost 14 years old now! She is a social butterfly and is constantly getting in trouble for socializing too much in class. She was recently voted \u201cmost popular\u201d at her school! I am sharing this story because parents need to realize the great power and ability they have to heal their children. I cannot say that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel but I think that there usually is. Love to all you parents who are fighting a great battle. Know that you are not alone \u2764\ufe0f The post is kind of hard to read so I split it up into paragraphs, hope you do not mind:\n\n&gt; My daughter Noelle was diagnosed with Selective Mutism which is an extreme form of Social Phobia when she was a toddler.

By the end of the Summer she was calling up family members and grandparents who had never heard her voice before and conversing with them for the first time. She was now able to speak normally outside of the school setting.\n&gt; \n&gt; She however still refused to speak at school. I knew children need to be treated at both home and school separately and that this would be the biggest hurdle to overcome because she had never had a teacher that was willing to invest in helping her overcome Selective Mutism. I desperately needed the cooperation of a willing teacher. When Noelle started 4th grade with Ms. Henry It was obvious that we had finally met the teacher that would be able to help Noelle overcome this great obstacle. Shannon immediately took an interest in Noelle and her disability and made it her number one goal that year to get Noelle speaking in class. I provided a book about Selective Mutism the first day I met Shannon and she immediately read it and studied Selective Mutism on her own time. \n\nShannon and I worked together to write out a classroom treatment plan for Noelle in taking steps towards being able to talk in class. She allowed me to take videos of Noelle speaking to the class from home and show them to the students. Shannon also worked with Noelle after school with several other students throughout the year in helping her to be able to talk to them. She also came to my home on various occasions to work with Noelle. Great gains were made early on. Gradually Noelle improved over the course of the year and she eventually was able to talk inside and outside of the classroom. By the end of the year a miracle occurred and Noelle was able to give a speech in front of her class. \n\nNoelle is almost 14 years old now! She is a social butterfly and is constantly getting in trouble for socializing too much in class. She was recently voted \u201cmost popular\u201d at her school! I am sharing this story because parents need to realize the great power and ability they have to heal their children. I cannot say that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel but I think that there usually is. Love to all you parents who are fighting a great battle. Know that you are not alone \u2764\ufe0f Thank you! Lovely story btw. Refreshing to see great parents like you from time to time. Have you posted about Noelle elsewhere? I swear I may have read about a Noelle with SM at some point.", "Selective mutism Q&amp;A Ask me anything about selective mutism and I will give my best answer! :) Hi, from what i understand, people with SM are physically unable to speak in certain situations,which is different to social anxiety (what i have). So how does SM feel when you want to say stuff but youre physically unable. When I was really pushed to speak, my experience was usually like this:  My throat would clench, as I push air to my larynx, I am choking, you can barely let any air out, almost no sound. I can breathe in, and try it again on next breath, but does not work. Pushing clearly does not work. I need relief.  I feel shame. \n\nI had SM from age 4 to 10, when I look back, I wish someone could just help me realize I could have communicated in different ways too. Hi, It feels very restricting as sometimes I want to say something so badly but no words come out. It often feels like I cannot express myself by talking freely without having to rely on writing. It is very restricting. It can stop you from making friends and just socialising. This is a big problem for me I have no friends because of my mutism. It affects your daily life because if you went to school I would not be able to say hi or ask to go to the loo but I am homeschooled so it does not affect me in that way but for other people it really is restricting. I hope this answers your question! :) What is the worst experience you have had because of your sm? Hi, so my worst experience happened around 4-5 years ago. I was in year 3 just started at that school with my friends. The teacher I had in year 3 left for to go somewhere else and we had a Scottish teacher. It all went find for a few weeks until she one day started yelling at me in front of the whole class because I did not say my name to the register because of my sm but I always nod or raise my hand. Anyway she was yelling saying \u201cyou need to talk I am sick of you not answering \u201c and a few other things. This made me feel sick and awful. My classmates said I do not talk though she knew. When I got home I cried and told my mum and she rang the school to tell them about it and then the teacher the next day apologised to me. When I was in year 6 I had this teacher for a day and she yelled at the back row 4 girls including me for not putting their hand up for a question and it shows that she does not care about anyone and is a awful teacher!\nI hope this answers your question! :) Dude said Q&amp;A like we all do not have it lmao erm...  i know that people on this channel have it but many people dont or either think they have it. I like to educate people either way, so if you do mind next time be a bit more respectful. If you are confused about having selective mutism, then you have the entire subreddit at your disposal to sift through. The subreddit is basically a Q&amp;A in and of itself. Doing a Q&amp;A on a niche subreddit like this for people like this does not fit the culture and purpose of a Q&amp;A. I was not being rude, it is just very odd placement. Ok, I understand your thoughts but I just wanted to do it so I could help at least 1% of people, and if you look in the comments people are curious. This is something I chose to do and I like doing it. So please if your not fond of it just ignore it and scroll on", "Inability to speak after constant trauma triggers. Traumatic mutism? Will I ever speak again? Who do I even talk to about this? I am trying to get in touch with my therapist and psych to no avail. Starting yesterday after a mental breakdown I could not speak. I am using text to speech to communicate. It feels like my voice has been ripped out of my throat by my mind.", "Content Creation?! I have been wanting to start streaming and making Youtube videos but I do not know how to communicate to the audience. I think it would be difficult to gain a following if I do not interact with fans. Does anyone know anyway that I can engage with an audience live? I have found making youtube videos is actually pretty easy even though I have SM. It is much easier because you can use a script, and talk into a camera/microphone without being afraid you will make a mistake. Just use some editing software and delete the parts where you messed up. You do not even need to show your face if you do not want to! \n\nAs for streaming, it is a little harder because you need to come up with conversation on the spot. Sadly there is not a way to avoid speaking and still attract an audience. I used to do it a few years ago, but I am too scared to now. Maybe you should focus on making youtube videos for now, and try streaming later if you become more comfortable. \n\nIf you do not mind me asking, what is the name of ur account(s)? I would love to support you! It is probably not ideal, but you could try text-to-speech engines for streaming. It may be slower than actual speaking but it would give you a way to audibly communicate with people :) There are at least a few creators on tiktok who do not talk and use text to speech with captions.  You can then just reply to comments on your videos. I know I have seen a few who have talked about their issues with SM as well. I have been thinking about starting streaming too. I would never publish anything if I could edit it. You could use text to speech or write on cards, and depending on what you do you do not need to talk much. An example of not speaking much is Hafu ( She does not speak much, especially when she plays Among Us. It is best to just go and do your thing without expectations, just do it because it is fun and pursue something else until videos possibly take off depending on what kind of content you are creating, maybe you could add subtitles in editing instead? I have a YouTube @ Epic Kid Kei!!! I could not find it. Can you send a link?  :)", "Remembering where I came from I am 20 now but I have had selective mutism in elementary school. I was a very anxious kid due to mostly emotional neglect and lack of social stimulation growing up. \n\nThe reason why I am here is because I was talking with a friend who has been with me since I had selective mutism and I was being hard on myself about my social anxiety.. but then she reminded me to \n\n\u201cnever discredit yourself on how far you have come\u201d\n\nI went to therapy in grade 7 and by the time I reached highschool (gr.8) my socials teacher called my name\nFor attendance and the for the first time, I said \u201chere\u201d \n\nthough it may have sounded like a faint whisper to others; to me, I was spoke over mountains. \n\nI hope this reaches those who need to hear that they can overcome this. Or maybe it is a loved one. Be patient and baby steps are key. Believe in them- do not make them feel guilty (like my parents did) \n\nI was also bullied by a lot of teachers for having selective mutism but that is besides the point.\n\nAnyways, I am curious but to those who have had or still have SM- how long have you had it for? And how are you doing now?", "Girlfriend with SM Well here goes nothing..so my girlfriend has SM since she was a child... We have been dating for 5 years now, with not so much progress tbh... Actually she is still struggling to speak with me. She cannot talk to me.. and it is been getting so frustrating sometimes, she does this moaning thing to more or less speak but still.. we never had a real conversation face to face. \nI am kind of tired tbh, and frustrated, I have tried everything I can to help but there seems to be no solution to this...\nWe are currently living together but this persists as day 1...\nAny advice? It is getting so hard to continue. I am also struggling a lot lately to deal with it, specially when she gets angry at me because she cannot communicate or I do not understand what she tries to tell me. do you guys have any kind of conversation? or how severe is the SM would u say Has she consodered some kind of therapy? Helped me in my early early ln my road to recovery.\n\nIt always helps me if I get words of encouragement\n\nI always have problem speaking when I am feeling uncomfortable, is something on her mind perhaps?\n\nYou cannot really get her to speak up, she has to overcome her inability to speak somehow. It isnt easy and I know how she feels. \n\nHave you talked about her mutism and how you feel? What has your gf done / is doing concretely in regards to dealing with her selective mutism ? If her SM is the same as it was on day 1, 5 years ago, it is unlikely it will all of a sudden go away in a few days. It could even worsen if she feels pressured to talk because you are on the verge of breaking up ... but ... you cannot continue this way either and so are really going to have to discuss this with her... I guess it all depends how you approach the topic and the tone/how you frame it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is far fetched but maybe learning sign language could be an option ? i recently saw a segment on SM from a french investigation show and it was about a woman in her 30s who suffered from SM since childhood to the point she had decided life would be easier communicating only by sign language. She thrived in that community and made tons of friends ... She did eventually little by little come over her SM but it was not simple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meanwhile, this is unfair that she is taking out her frustrations on you ... Even if she cannot talk , which is totally not her fault, this could be at least something she could improve. Try to focus more on the positives of the relationship and on what you love about her. Also, maybe you could  discuss this with a therapist specialised in anxieties (unfortunately therapists specialised in SM are harder to find than a needle in a hay stack), but at least a specialist will be able to help you know how you should deal when your gf starts getting an outburst and they will maybe have some answers (or connections/ressources) in regards to SM or at least the anxiety aspect of it Severe. She cannot speak to me , and she cannot speak to others if I am there. She actually can speak to other people if I am not there. I have talked to her plenty of times. She always avoids the problem. She never went to therapy because she thought it was useless.. right now therapist in this country are really expensive, and we cannot afford to pay one... We live in a 3rd world country, so things are really difficult atm, because it is been getting worse lately.\nI thought about sign language, talked about it sometimes but she thinks it is a joke... Have you tried any other means of communication? Such as sign language, writing, texting...etc. It is also important to ask direct yes/no questions so she can respond. Almost 95% of questions can be rephrased into a yes/no question. Also, note that she may not be able to communicate nonverbally in some ways. SM affects nonverbal communication too. For example, I am only able to communicate by nodding/shaking my head. I cannot gesture or write. It is like I psychically cannot move, no matter how hard I try. The same goes for speaking. I just cannot speak, no matter how hard I try. If I do try, no sound comes out. Yes, almost everything comes down to yes/no questions, but when I ask her to write or text me she gets paralyzed or something along those lines.. specially when we have a problem. \nShe told me the same but still... I do not think I am able to deal with it any longer... I needed to vent. 5 years is a long journey of no progression at all.... Not the original person you replied to, but some people with SM find sign language helpful (I do, but I learned it in childhood), some do not. It is worth a shot to try, but do not pressure her. If she wants to try it, that is her choice. Yep, brought the sign language topic a couple of times but she does not want to... I do not no what else to do tbh. how did you guys get into a relationship when she does not even want to communicate with you. Uhm... Do you even know what SM is? Wait a second ? Your gf can speak to other people but you ? That is heartbreaking... \n\nif she is reluctant about changing the situation and does not even want to TRY then you will probably have to make a decision about where the relationship is going because if she refuses to do anything and is set in her ways, it will be 5 and more years of this. You cannot force her to change if she does not even want to...\n\nIf she is already jumping to the worst case scenario and is convinced nothing will work before even trying, its definitely what a therapist can help with but if therapy is not an option, it is going to be extremely difficult to change her pattern of thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe a relationship related sub will have more advice in regards to how to deal with your gf because this goes  beyond SM if she is refusing to even try, listen to you and keeps avoiding the problem - while you are suffering from the situation Thanks for reading me and taking the time, yeah it is actually heart breaking, but got used to it later on. I am currently stuck with the situation and seeing how it develops... Hey, I am a bit late to this thread, but I have been suffering from SM since elementary school. One of the biggest things that prevents me from speaking to even my grandparents is or ordering food is that I am scared of how people will react and I do not want people to make a huge deal out of it. Something along the lines of \u201cwow! You spoke!\u201dmay sound encouraging but it is actually the complete opposite. Yeah, know about that as well, so if somehow I hear something I just play dumb, but on the inside I am like \"oh shit it is about damn time\"", "This kid has Selective Mutism &amp; so much personality!

I just keep everything inside while I go around knocking on things and then explode with someone who has nothing to do with the story and will not do anything but listen to me.\n\nSo I was wondering how you guys deal with that. If there are crises in the middle of discussions, they explode with everything and these things. I know it goes from person to person, that everyone has their own way of dealing with everything, but if you can help me, I will be very grateful. Hello! Selective mute here, and from my experience, seeing fights start generally makes anxiety build up until the argument or fight becomes bad enough that I cannot keep up with or understand what is going on anymore, at usually a level of loud verbal fighting or just plain shouting from the start. At this point, my anxiety will be pushed past its limit and my brain will basically \"shut off\" my ability to speak or communicate clearly, and I will occasionally try to calm myself by rocking back and forth or covering my ears. I know everyone is experience is different, but I hope this helped! It reminded me a little of me, the few times I have ever argued with anyone, I have not been able to think of anything to say, my brain goes blank and suddenly I just start crying with anger and frustration and I want it all to be over. If someone intends to start a discussion with me, I do everything to stop it and if I get really sad about it I just go to my bedroom and lay down on my bed, or I do something that I know will make me happy.  If I say something that I should not have said, or say something rather polemic I try to apologise or just agree with the other person, after this person starts talking. Basically, I avoid all kinds of discussions. And also, this only happens inside my family (mom, dad, siblings). If I say something I should not, I spend the rest of my life whining about it.", "Current rough opening for my story. Please tell me what you think.  It requires you to request access first.

Sometimes even when I am not in a social setting, just talking to myself, I cannot get words out. It feels like my brain is prohibiting me even thought I want to badly get it out. And the weird part is, it does not really happen when I am doing a presentation or speaking to a larger group of people, but a smaller group of people, one person, or just myself it is noticeably worse. I do not think that is, selective mutism is the opposite  Not necessarily. SM just means you have issues talking in certain situations but are able to talk in other situations. It is not categorized as certain size of group/audience, I myself are able to speak quite well when alone or with a certain friend when speaking in, for example, a restaurant but would be unable to talk to my guitar instructor one on one or in that same restaurant with my parents. It can change based on who you are with, the setting, or who you are talking to, not just the size of the group.

I always just think of Allison from The Breakfast Club even though that is not necessary SM, i have made her my brand lol Raj from The Big Bang Theory is the go to example I use when explaining what selective mutism is to someone. Effy Stonem from Skins There was a book made into a movie called Speak where the main character stops speaking after a traumatic experience (rape).\n\nMaya Angelou also developed this after she was raped at 9 years old and stopped speaking for 5 years.\n\nThere are physically mute or just silent characters I still relate to, like Elisa from The Shape of Water, or Wall-e from Wall-e. the main girl in the book/movie Speak, sort of. Speak is on my favorite books, I read it before I even knew about SM but loved it because it was so relatable. It also portrayed depression very well and just made me feel so understood in general, even though I have never been through a traumatic experience. The John wick movies are my favourite movies of all time and ruby rose plays ares in the second one who is a mute assassin. A Quiet Kind of Thunder is really good ~ it is a love story between a girl with sm and a deaf boy &gt;A Quiet Kind of Thunder\n\nI am amazed they wrote a book like this! Just bought it on Amazon, cannot wait to read it. It is excellent representation! I read it fully in a day lol Thought of another example, mermaids, from The Little Mermaid, to Splash, etc. Mr. Bean Wow, thanks for this question and the great examples!\n\nI am actually writing a book with a main character with SM.

I am late in responding here, but there is a Japanese manga called Kimi Ni Todoke.  The main character, though not officially selectively mute, struggles with extreme shyness while being misunderstood by her classmates.

Also somewhere I saw some said Dopey from Snow White but I have not seen that movie in a long time so I do not know There is a novel called, \"The problem with forever.\" The main character is a teenage girl with sm/severe social anxiety following her traumatic childhood of abuse.

Highly recommended.", "talking causes me anxiety hi all. i am 16 years old, and i have recently realized that talking with my own voice makes me extremely unhappy and anxious. however, at work (i work retail), ive tried to go an hour or so without talking out loud, and it makes me feel amazing. would it be wrong of me to stop talking? i think about it constantly. What you are describing is different to SM (SM is the inability to talk sue to anxiety, not a conscious choice). Most people here desperately WANT to talk, but cannot. IE. from my perspective I would advise you to not take talking for granted.\n\nIf talking makes you anxious it is worth looking into social anxiety disorder, there are ways to manage it and make it a less unpleasant experience.\n\nYou have free will, so you can do what you want in terms of 'not talking', but it is worth saying that people can treat people who do not talk extremely cruelly, and often see it as a sign of weakness to exploit, or belligerence that they want punished. So 'not talking' might not be as good as you think it is. SM in my eyes snowballs, you never want to let yourself 'go' for too long, otherwise it will add to the issues. \n\nI made the most progress with the journey to overcome my SM in July of this year, but 10 days into August and I have taken a real step back, at this point in time I regret that. I lost motivation to talk for this time, though now it is hard because currently my family and I have not been in contact as much as we were in July, which helped me the most.\n\nAnd I will go pick up food for everyone and tell the cashier the order and stuff (I am picking it up, the name, etc.)....I have yet to say 'thank you,' besides a head nod....or more than what is required to be said. Though I have become less anxious about going into these stores to pickup these foods. My SM tends to affect my family the most, but strangers I can talk to...although I am nervous.\n\nI think staying silent for all these years, I am 18 has affected me pretty majorly and probably why I have such self-confidence issues because I am used to people treating me like a kid and not someone with their own identity. I think that is a real issue among those with SM, they get strung along like that. I am whatever when it comes to people thinking I am stupid or something because that just tells me their a-holes.\n\nWhat motivates me to keep getting that food and not giving up is because I WANT that ease-ability in life, to where I can do whatever I need to. If it requires me to speak, I speak.....I have heard in time I will not miss the comfort-factor of SM, it is apparently a false sense of comfort, and that gives me the MOST comfort when it comes to wanting to overcome SM.\n\nBasically overcoming SM or anxiety (Depending), it is all about doing more and more, we do not grow from this without being uncomfortable about it. You have to battle the anxiety, so it becomes more and more manageable as time goes on. im 16 also and i have the same problem. I havent spoken in a year almost mainly because of my self esteem and trauma. I mainly dont talk because i cant muster any courage to do so at all. Some people think im ignoring them or being rude what makes me upset but if people understand its not bad. Though i think you should try improve your self esteem and keep trying to talk. (hypocritical much) Its your choice, its not like you can \u201cappropriate\u201d selective mutism, although id advise against claiming to have it if its a conscious choice (i know the \u201cselective\u201d in it is kind of confusing). You should definitely seek help regarding social anxiety though. I was like that for a bit as well and for the same reasons. I am 15. I did not realize people thought it was rude until my teacher straight up ignored everything else that seemed wrong and told my father I was aloof and stand-offish :,/ I always tried to smile or acknowledge them properly. I did not like staying at home lots but it is good my parents kept me here for the rest of sophomore year I do not have SM but I did have severe social anxiety, I would highly recommend you getting professional help for your anxiety before you turn towards stopping talking completely. Speaking from experience here, once you start isolating yourself like that, it becomes much harder to speak when you need or want to  \n\n\nI am really sorry you are in this position though, whether it be social anxiety or something else, I know how hellish it can be and I wish you the best of luck with your recovery &lt;3 is therapy or other forms of professional help an option for you? my mom said she would call my doctor about therapy but she said it is probably too expensive. honestly just not talking makes me feel a million times better about life. i never thought it would really be a good thing and i know people would be rude about it. it is just what makes me feel better about myself. i totally get you! sometimes i literally cannot speak to someone because of how afraid i am to say the wrong thing. but for the most part, i can talk to people, it just makes me unhappy. i am trying, my mom has been saying for years that she will get me into therapy but never does. that comfort part hit especially hard for me. i get this overwhelming feeling of okayness and happiness when i do not talk, and that makes so much sense. One thing that might be worth looking into is AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication), perhaps? Mouth words are definitely not the only way humans can (and do) communicate.  \nThough I will also echo what others have mentioned about the potential differences between this feeling you are describing, OP, and \"selective\" (situational) mutism. i have tried therapy multiple times but it never helped. thank you so much for educating me!", "What could have your teachers have done to make school easier for you? ", "Does SM take a toll on your voice? I have only been mute for like 2 months, but I have noticed that whenever I do try an talk it comes off really raspy and quiet, even when I try and project. Also my singing has become worse. No matter how hard I try and talk loud and clear, it always comes off raspy and quiet. It is raspy and quiet if I talk after not talking for a long time. Then, it gets better when I use my voice for a while. SM does actually cause paralyzed vocal cords, so that is why that happens. It is pretty frustrating. Makes sense, thank you! Yeah, I guess I just got to practice using my voice more to strengthen them. Thank you! In a way that will help, but it is not necessarily about strengthening the vocal cords themselves. The problem does not actually lie in your vocal cords at all. The reason you have paralyzed vocal cords is because your brain causes that to happen whenever you are around people you are not comfortable with, as a way of \u201cprotecting\u201d you. Then when you are in a setting where you are comfortable, your brain allows them to unparalyze. So you will have to work on feeling less anxious first, and then your ability to speak will follow. This is done by exposure therapy usually. Absolutely. People used to always think I was getting sick because my voice was so raspy and weak. It still happens sometimes, but my SM is not nearly as bad as it uses to be. It is unfortunate because I would try so hard to overcome the anxiety and speak, only to become even more self-conscious because someone said something like, \"oh no, you poor thing, you are losing your voice!\" Yes I believe it does.  \nThere were a few times before that I was mute for most of the day, and I remember realizing that my throat would start hurting if I started singing (obviously alone)  \nLater when I tried to get talkative again people told me to stop lowering my voice  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af Yes it definitely does.

You could start with writing to her; saying that you want to talk to her, but the words will not come out (or however you want to describe it). I relate to this so much, but also be proud. In a way you stepped out of your comfort zone. U could have stayed mute but you did not. Im not sure if you like Friend B but trust me the more you do this the more comfortable you will be with being uncomfortable, it kind of depends if you really do see Friend B as a friend but either way you made progress. Good job", "(22F) Group interactions? Friends of friends? Can anyone relate? I did not have that much friends in elementary school. I only spoke to my friends. Literally no one else besides them, except maybe the P.E. coach heard my voice. When my friend's friends would show up I would literally freeze and not utter a single word nor move a single muscle. Something just felt unsafe? I felt like I was paralyzed and was unable to get any movement out of my body, but there were always racing thoughts inside my head. Not even a little whispery \"hi\" or a hand wave.\n\nThis similar thing has come back and happened a couple of times recently. I get invited to a virtual hangout. If it is just with my friends, I am able to communicate perfectly fine. But if at least one of my friend's friends make an appearance that scenario of being mute as a child happens again. It is something about their presence and it changes everything about me. I cannot even introduce myself. I do not even send any text messages. No introductions, no goodbyes. I just pop in hang around for how long I can tolerate it and then leave like a ninja. When I was younger I would always just sit in silence and discomfort the entire time, but as an adult I leave when my energy is depleted and I know things are going downhill for me. I do not even hate or dislike the friend at all, it is nothing like that, but something just makes me feel unsafe to the point where I cannot say/text any words because I feel like it makes me vulnerable and that I may leave a poor impression on said friend(s) of friend...\n\nMy mind is always filling itself up with sentences and I usually have something to say. Like in one-on-one conversations, I talk A LOT! But in these types of group interactions, it is just different and it is very frustrating. I know my friends want me to interact with their friends, but something just does not feel right so I cannot let myself out like that? :(\n\nDoes anyone relate or have any tips? Thanks for checking the post out. I feel exactly like this; great 1-on-1 but in groups I lose it and say very little to nothing depending on how comfortable I am around the people. I was diagnosed with high-functioning autism and it kind of explained a lot as it is often comorbid with selective mutism. I wish I knew how to help more, but I have never really been able to fully get over the mutism around certain groups of people in particular.", "I think it is coming back I had SM growing up but managed to get over it entering high school. I really opened up in high school but now years after school, I feel like SM is creeping it is way back into my life. When meeting my gfs friends and family, I want to be more conversational but I can hardly get more than a few words out. Even if I do manage to think of a short story to tell, it comes out all jumbled and not really what I wanted to say.  I am not really sure what to do about it. When I got over my SM the first time I basically just said to myself \"I am done. I am going to talk\". But now I want to talk but cannot think of anything to say. It is like the SM knows I am not afraid to talk so it is stopping me at the step before that. How about \u201crehearsing\u201d it beforehand? I used to do this a lot. I actually still do. Basically think about what you are going to say, and then repeat it over and over in your head. You can imagine yourself saying it too if that helps. It is shockingly effective in helping you feel more able to speak, and it can also help it come out less jumbled and shaky.", "I talked over a zoom interview This is is first time talking to someone who I do not live with. It felt weird, as if my mind was empty but aware, like I was dreaming. That Is a mood", "Am I doing it wrong... I have not been able to talk to my friends over mic before. I have been the one writing literally thousands of messages while the others speak. Now a while ago my friend managed to help me say a word. One word. Then it slowly progressed into a bit more words, then even more words. Then even a short short sentence or two. But this has been very spread out, since some days it feels absolutely impossible to speak, and some days it feels a lot easier. So it could take weeks before I would speak again, since it also depends on the situation a lot. I have to be completely alone to speak, otherwise it is just t oo hard at the moment. My family memebers cannot be near when I am doing social practice, it just makes it a lot harder. And I have chronic fatigue which makes me extremely tired physically, which makes speaking very very difficult, since when I am tired I also depersonalize and derealize, which ALSO makes speaking more difficult(for most people who experience  this even). So it is still VERY difficult, but sometimes I can speak. And the situations where I can speak are getting more and more, a few days ago I even said a few words when my brother was in the room besides mine. I feel like, a lot of things make it more difficult. Distractions. But my friends do not seem to get that, they are just calling it bad excuses basically, and that I should just ignore everything and close my eyes and speak. Because apparently it is easy, I just have to open my mouth and do noises. I am just being ridiculous apparently. I am making it harder for myself apparently. When I say speaking is difficult today because I am very very nauseous and tired because of the medicine I take, they just say it is bad excuses and I should stop making it harder for myself. But I try to identify what makes it harder and push it away, and aknowledge it so I know why it is harder this time. But apparently it is just bad excuses and I should just not talk about things that affects it according to my friends. One of them even had SM but I feel like he lost perspective, he keeps saying it is easy and I could just speak now if I want to enough. My friends just say I am not trying and I do not want to enough basically. Hearing this all day has made me seriously doubt myself, maybe I do not know myself as much I thought... I thought maybe speaking where I feel more comfortable would give me a better experience, since it is actually really fun then, and more doable, and expands the situations where I can speak gradually. Now I just feel not motivated at all anymore, since apparently everything is just excuses and apparently I am doing too slow progress and apparently it is just as easy to speak when on methotrexate, I am just lying to myself or something or whatever they are saying. I do not even understand anymore Please dont doubt yourself. Their perspective is definitely not right. People who have Selective Mutism can speak when they feel COMFORTABLE, not when they are being berated for not speaking. \n\nIs there something you are particularly good at? Like art, music, etc? You are clearly trying as hard as you can. The way they are talking to you seems to just be causing you more anxiety which in turn is going to make it more difficult for you to talk. You need to be comfortable and finding a way to remind them that may help. \n\nAre you taking any medication as part of your treatment? It is something worth considering if you are not. I had SM as a child and I am not sure I would have made any progress in treatment with my therapist without it. \n\nI hope things get better for you! I know it is hard now but it really can get better or even go away entirely with time.  I do not feel comfortable around my friends? Obviously, if they are making you feel like you are making excuses, than you are not completely comfortable with them. Like you cant be yourself, or that you have to say the \"right\" thing. \n\nMy DD could only speak to me and my older DD. It took her 4+ years to speak to her dad. Medication, therapy, and working on things that take her out of her comfort zone have helped her to where she can answer questions in class, and shes been able to read an essay out loud in public.  They have accepted it and understand it now. Maybe because nobody did at first, it got worse with time. ", "Questioning if I might have SM I can talk in my normal voice only with my immediate family. I can force myself to speak in front of others but the voice is tiny and cartoonishly high pitched and emotionless. It is like I have to push it out of myself. \n\nI have tried therapy for this countless times, but there were no improvements nor after a month, nor after a year.\n\nIt is really making communicating with others impossible. Selective Mutism is a form of (highly complex) social anxiety so having it treated as such is normal. Sounds like it could be Selective Mutism, to me. Not everyone with SM are the same nor show the same symptoms/behaviors. Cant say 100%, only a psychologist could do that . I gave a pretty dense write-up about how my particular brand of SM presents itself (in the \"Selective Mutism means Autism\" thread), but although there are many many common threads, not everyone presents the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be interested in knowing how many similarities there are between your situation and the one I wrote about. Here is the thread in case you are interested: (", "/selectivemutism Subdirect Statistics ", "How do I approach someone with SM? Hello everyone, I hope that all is well. I go to school with a girl that has SM. I have always thought that she is an amazing person and I would really like to get to know her better, but I have always been too nervous to approach her and we have only exchanged a few smiles throughout the years. She is shy and I have only heard her speak a few times, and I have high-functioning Autism which makes interacting with people difficult. \n\n\nWhat are some ways I can start up a conversation with her? The last thing I want is to make her feel uneasy or uncomfortable. I am sorry if this is not the right place to ask (or if this post is redundant as a similar question has been posted recently), but I do not know who to reach out to, as all the SM resources I can find online are concerning young children, and we are both in our late teens.\n\n\nThank you I think this is a great place to ask this question so no worries there! So I have SM and I am also in my late teens so I think I can confidently answer your question. :) There really is no one right way to interact with someone with SM (everyone is different) so I will just answer this based on my experiences. This does not apply to all people with SM but might work in your situation. The best way for someone new to approach me is to take small steps. Starting out with some smiles over the years is good because that shows trust, and mutual interest in getting to know each other better. Next you can begin to venture out of the smiles from afar and approach this person with something as simple as a compliment, a question (maybe related to something in class or a random opinion in general, or anything else you feel is relevant.) I caution you from rushing into this, of course, as the last thing you would want to do is put this person at a loss for words, because I personally know how awful it is to not have the words to respond. It makes me worry that I have made the person who talked to me feel uneasy and they will never talk to me again. The #1 thing to remember is have patience. Even if it means putting this person outside of their comfort zone a little bit, they will warm up to you after time if you do not give up, and you are persistent in reaching out to them. If you have tried talking to them and it seems uncomfortable to them after a few times, I recommend asking them for their number. Sometimes texting is a great way to find common ground, and it is good practice for talking in real life. I truly appreciate the people like you who are mindful in reaching out to those with SM as it is such a little known anxiety disorder to a majority of people on this planet. Those who have SM want to make friends just as much as everyone else, so I thank you for your desire to approach this person, and I think they will soon appreciate this too! Let me know if you have any other questions, I would love to help! Idk how, but in 7th grade I managed to envelope myself into a friend group....my kind of goodish friend was in my spanish class, and was obviously friendly with these two other kids I never really knew before.....I would just smile at them....eventually idk how, but I became friends with those two other kids......uh, and my current friend group also managed to be friends with them....but that was 7th grade only, after that everything fell apart.....until I made new friends in ninth grade.\n\nEdit: One of those two kids I made friends with....we grew apart, but when we were friends he would just always have something to talk with me about....I did not make much conversation back (not that I can remember much of that time).....and the other friend, still keeps tabs....be it very infrequent after 2 school years almost out of highschool now....\n\nI would consider the other one who still keeps tabs as a more mutual friend, but he always has stuff to talk about when he is talking to me. Again I do not add much, but yeah. Thank you so so much, I swear this must be the kindest online community I have ever came across :) (sorry for replying a bit late, it was like 2am when I wrote that post)\n\nYou have put a lot of my worries aside, I understand that everyone is different but thanks to you I now have a good grasp on how to handle the situation, it will still be difficult as I do not have that many classes with her but I will try to start making those little steps again whenever I see the opportunity and I will be patient and give her the time she needs. Actually talking to her for the first time will be very stressful for me but I will do my best haha\n\nMy only worry is that we have had not really had any interactions in the past two years (with online school and everybody having to wear masks in school) and I really fear that I might have done something wrong at some point that made her dislike me somehow :/ Thank you :) I am happy for you that you managed to get into that friend group, even if it did not work out in the end... smiling seems to be a frequent theme so I am taking notes! You probably did not do anything to make her dislike you, even though sometimes it might feel that way. Sometimes I fear things like my body language or facial expressions (or lack thereof) scare people off, and might send the wrong message. Something you should know about SM is that sometimes people who have it might have stiff or awkward body posture or a blank facial expression when they are in a setting (like school) where they are not totally at ease.) Just know that if you are noticing these things, it is very unlikely it is about you at all. For people like me, it is very hard to make relationships at school with new people, so please keep trying! I would really appreciate people like you at my school who are reaching out in this careful manner, and I thank you again on behalf of the SM community for your kindness and mindfulness! :) That is what I had hoped for, but it is really easing to hear confirmation from someone with the condition! \n\n\nDo not worry, I already am aware that she cannot help her mannerisms and I do not mind them at all (although it does make me sad to see how nervous she can be, I can only imagine how difficult things must be for her), but the pessimist in me sometimes thought that I am part of what makes her nervous, I will now know not to overthink that\n\n\nI think that is all the questions/concerns I have _for now_, once again thank you and I really really appreciate how nice this community has been to me... I hope that I can reach out to you in the future if I need any further advice :) Of course you can reach out in the future, and please do! I am excited to hear how this works out! Good luck to you! Hi, I hope you are doing well. I am very sorry for not writing to you for such a long time. I have not forgotten, it is just that a lot has not happened in regards to her and me. We do not see each other around too much (trying to talk to her in class will not work with the way our classes are), and with everyone wearing masks it makes things so much more complicated. We have had a few interactions from afar (no eye contact or words but she was definitely trying to tell me something, it is difficult to explain) but I cannot tell if they are good or bad signs.\n\nI have told a really understanding friend and we have both figured that the only way for me to take the next step would be to approach her during lunchtime when she is alone. I understand that this is not ideal as it could be putting her on the spot, but it is the only option I have. Do you have any advice for me for this specific scenario? What do I do if she is unable to say anything? My friend would probably be there to support me as he is a lot more social and I think I would have a panic attack if he was not there haha. I am just very worried about getting it wrong and putting her at a loss of words. Once again thank you, and I hope I am not being insensitive in any way Hi thanks for writing back! No worries that it is been awhile, I have been very busy with school and such too. It is definitely that busy time of November where grades are starting to matter a lot lol. First off I would just like to say that you seem SO polite, kind, and courteous in this situation, and in no way are you being insensitive so please do not worry about that! :)\n\nSecondly, I think that Operation Approach This Girl At Lunch (if this mission needs a name lol sorry for the cringe) is a great idea given the circumstances of not being able to talk to her in class. Picturing myself in this situation, I might feel a tiny bit put on the spot in a setting like a lunch room where it feels like everyone is watching you at every moment, but I think it is ok in your case. I wish there were people like you in my life who wanted to reach out and pull me out of my comfort zone, and I am guessing this girl is probably in a similar boat as me. Regarding coming with your friend, that might add on a little stress to the situation, so I would recommend just coming by yourself. I will bet that this girl will not be silent for you, because you seem to care so much to make the effort to reach out to her. Another thing I can think of to make this encounter a little more relaxed is first asking if you can sit with her. If you are standing, it might be harder for her to talk to you (I personally have a very soft voice and I would feel terrible not being able to talk loud enough to be heard.) Sitting next to her will make the conversation a lot easier on both you and her. \n\nIf in the case this girl has a loss for words, there is always the option of asking her number if it is starting to get awkward and she looks nervous. She might calm down a bit because she can show you her phone (type out her number) or maybe even whisper it to you. If she is not saying much, she is definitely thinking about a lot. Just be yourself, and just start telling a funny story or a joke. If you be yourself and do not act nervous, she will be more comfortable being herself and opening up to you. Do not freak out if she seems a little upset or nervous, just stay calm and know that after more and more encounters with her things will become easier and more natural. :)\n\nI wish you so much luck with this. Also, I apologize if anything I wrote does not make much sense (I am typing fast and not proofreading words that might be nonsensical lol.) If something I wrote does not make sense, or you have other questions, please message me again because I would be more than happy to help you! Thank you, and I am happy that you understand. I hope your school studies are going well, I know its a pretty hectic time of the year haha.\n\n\nIt is good to know that this mission is a good idea all things considered :) I am not sure if I would meet her at the lunch room, or this quiet spot I see her hanging out alone sometimes (almost everyone goes to the town to buy food so the school building is empty during lunch so she often stays there), which do you think would be best? As you suggested, I will go alone, as difficult as this will be. I will try my best to be calm and I will definitely not mind if she seems nervous, hopefully each new interaction will get better for her. I just hope that she will also understand that I can be awkward lol. She has a very soft voice from what I have heard and I have problems processing voices so I will definitely ask to sit beside her. The asking for phone number thing is a great idea, I will definitely try that! Would it be better to ask for her phone number or like a social media account name? I do not mind either way so long as we can text, but I think most people here talk through things like instagram\n\nI have one more question for now, I am not sure if you would know anything about this as this is something veryyy specific to our situation (it is okay if you do not!) but I have read that people who have immigrated from non-English speaking countries at a very young age are more likely to have SM, and we are both immigrants from the same country (the only ones in our entire grade). Would she be more comfortable if I spoke to her in our native language? I am guessing that this is something I would have to ask her about.\n\n\nSorry for not getting back to you earlier but I had to go to sleep early as I had a busy day at school. Everything you write makes sense and it is very insightful to me, do not worry about it :) And I cannot stress this enough, thank you. I do not know where I would get all this information if it were not for you! Hey hope you are having a good day! Yeah I would still try for the lunch room encounter, and that actually sounds like an even better situation given that the school is mostly empty at this time. As for the phone thing, I really have no idea what the best option is, you will just have to ask her what she prefers. \n\nI have actually heard that same thing that non native speakers of a language are more likely to have SM somewhere too. I think the best option is to just speak in the language you are more comfortable speaking everyday at school, but definitely ask her if you are curious. \n\nHope this helps, and good luck!", "I cannot talk in a therapy setting I would say my selective mutism has gotten a little better over the years but a lot of that might just be because have less interactions overall so I do not notice it. I turned to homeschool last year in the middle of the year cause I kept getting bad panic attacks every night and morning. I just could not take regular school anymore, still have no clue what i am going to do school wise this year.\n\nIf someone asks me a direct question I can usually give a 1-2 word response or i will just smile. My big issues are starting and continuing a conversation. It is not just that I cannot talk but also I do not have anything to say. I am pretty boring so do not have much to add to conversations. All of my friends that I did have left because of my lack of personality.\n\nOk so as said in the title I do take therapy. The thing is I cannot bring myself to talk in it. I do not know if it is a trust thing but I just become nonverbal and rarely make eye contact. Rarely get even a word out. \n\nMedications have not helped my general anxiety. Even if it did somehow get rid of my anxiety I do not think that would help my selective mutism. Because of my selective mutism I lack basic social skills and meds cannot fix that. You could take either a pen and paper or your phone/tablet so you can talk to your therapist through writing rather than verbally. These are common issues for people with SM.\n\nI also feel like I am a boring person with nothing to add to conversations, and I have been trying to improve this by watching more (movies, TV, YouTube), reading more and teaching myself new things that I can do as hobbies. By expanding your interests and hobbies, you should have more to talk about and feel better about your personality. how long have you been going to therapy? personally, it took me quite a few sessions before i was comfortable talking to my therapist. if it does not improve over time, you could try going to other counselors and see if you may be more comfortable talking to somebody else. \n\ni also think it could be beneficial for you to start journaling and bringing your journal to sessions. you could let your counselor read it, or just have it with you as a reminder that you Do have things to say!", "Possible trigger? I think I may have been trigger into being sm? Recently I figured out that I was sexually a****lted, only figuring this out recently. Now I cannot speak to anyone publicly, and if I do I get major anxiety and cannot go above a whisper. I can speak to my family but even had trouble speaking to by one outside of that, can something like this happen? Can something like this exist? SM is an anxiety disorder not a response to trauma. Difficulty with speaking after a trauma would be more relaxed to an acute stress disorder or post traumatic stress. Thank you for responding! This helps me out a lot, I will ask my therapist about it. ^^ Mutism can be a symptom following trauma, but it is not usually considered clinically under the umbrella of SM since it has a different origin and needs different treatment. \n\nThat said, you can still find solidarity here with people who understand the experience of mutism I think! \n\nWishing you the best of luck! Thank you so much, I appreciate it! I am not sure if I had SM before trauma or after, it is a bit of a mess, but probably went more like I had SM really early on, got treated and got good, and then trauma brought it back/made it worse again. I do not see why SM could not be related to trauma as trauma triggers a stress response and SM is an anxiety based disorder, stress and anxiety are very much linked with each other through symptoms and rhe way they work, it is listed as a CPTSD symptom over at r/CPTSD, it can also be a stand alone thing. This community still has a bunch of struggles I relate to so I do not plan on leaving any time soon, you can choose to do the same if you want to and if that seems beneficial to you. I will check it out! Thank you so much for the support! Yeah, no problem! I actually got pointed here from there  haha, go and make some friends and learn about stuff. Even if it is not CPTSD that you have, the techniques and stuff you learn can be beneficial for many closely related disorders, illnesses, and groups of symptoms. I have suffered from some type of trauma, like you said even if I do not have it I could always learn healthy coping mechanisms from it.", "Is this SM? Help. Hello, I am 21 yo and I really want to know of this is SM in me or maybe just Social Anxiety or something else. \n\nAs a kid, I was mute with teachers and students to the point where my teacher called my parents because she thought I was incapable of speaking. Also when I was in kindergarten, if I wanted help (for example someone to tie my shoes) I would not ask for help and stay in my place and start crying silently, also when I wanted to go to the bathroom. I really liked learning in kindergarten but I started hating going because I would face situations where I needed to talk and ask for help. Around my family, I was at first always laughing and happy kid but after I got into primary school, I became more and more mute around my family too. Like I could speak superficially and briefly with them but that is all. If I am having a problem, I would try to solve it myself and never ask for help even if I really needed help. When teachers spoke to me, I would act like I did not hear them just so I avoid interacting with them. Ohh and when they send me to bring them something from another class, I literally start crying in my way to the other class. \n\nNow, as a grown up, I am much better tbh, I no longer have that fear I used to have, but I still talk superficially to most people. Like my thoughts are deep and I think about topics for long, but I just cannot speak to someone who I think will not get it or when I do not feel comfortable. I have like 3 good friends and I can be very cheerful and talkative around them and they like me and I like them a lot. And we can speak deeply about any topic. But they are very few and I am tirrred of this.

Yup. Do not have a clue about selective mutism tbh, but I get this all the time. I just buy my shit and go, and can only mumble thanks. YES! This also happens to me when I visit my grandma with my parents. I just really do not want to be the first one to walk into her house. I will be like \"Nope!

As an adult it improved and for the most part I have been sociable and talkative with my coworkers and friends.\n\nThese past few months, something has changed. \nIt feels like something broke inside me. I noticed greater anxiety when speaking at work, and my speech grew quieter and shaker and sparser until just getting a single word out is torture. \n\nI was almost convinced I had suffered physical damage to my brain but so far my testing has not shown anything. It seems to be mental. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it even possible to develop SM as an adult?", "Can selective mutism be triggered by stress/trauma? Can it manifest in adulthood? I (20F) have never identified as a selective mute through childhood. I never had issues talking when I was young or anything, but I had a bit of a traumatic childhood of which the effects became more exacerbated once I entered high school.\nI was diagnosed with depression, and so I would have a lot of emotional breakdowns and anxiety attacks. During these attacks, people would ask me what was wrong and I felt like I just could not speak at all. There was stuff I was trying to communicate but I just could not say anything, which resulted in me just having tears run down my face, staring at the other person, blinking but not saying anything, maybe squirming. During those episodes I would find that the only way I could communicate was through writing or typing, and I just could not verbalize anything. Eventually once I calmed down I would be able to say a few words, and then I went back to normal. I talk a lot, and I do not have any problems talking to strangers or people I dislike etc etc\n\nDoes this sound like selective mutism? I googled it a few times but most sources tell me you can only have it if you have had it all your life. I am hoping someone can help me verify that. Thanks! This sounds very similar to how I experience SM - might be worth seeing a therapist, although I have a lot of trouble even getting as far as explaining the problem to them in the first place.. Hopefully you will find someone helpful though, writing things out definitely is a big help! Thank you!! It could be an anxiety attack. I do this when I get triggered. It only last up to an hour.

Would it be possible for the body to not develope certain organs responsible for speaking? \nLike a muscle that you do not use? There is a girl on youtube who lives off a van that believes she suffered from selective mutism growing up. She says she was told by a doctor that her tone of voice (kind of sounds like a smoker... I myself often sound like this... All my life I was practically mute most of the time) can be caused by damaged vocal chords. I will add a lil to her channel so you can hear what she sounds like. Edit:Stephie Lee- \"why my voice is weird\"  Not sure but maybe a speech therapist could help I was told to sing and push slightly higher and slightly lower than my normal voice. And to hum songs quietly as often as possible. Read out loud every day, and gradually increase how much out loud reading you do. But do not strain in any way. It is about the more often you do it, the easier it gets each time- repetition and regularly exercising the muscles and nerves. \\ Great tips, I have been doing that already :) Never heard of her, thanks for the video suggestion It is possible for the vocal cords to atrophy, though I do not think I have heard about it being caused directly by SM. Maybe in drastic cases. I agree, this does seem possible. though Stephie has cystic fibrosis, which has a huge negative impact on lung function.

I can talk to strangers and sometimes am even brave enough to initiate talking to them, but I have difficulty making friends because I usually hold back/do not know what to say/reply when people talk to me. I am just not good at answering questions spontaneously which is probably weird to some people hahaha...\nFor example someone could ask me \"do you like cats or dogs more?\" and I would reply \"I do not really know?\".\n\nBut I go home and think about it (lol) and I can come up with lots of answers like \"I like cats more because they are cute and are less active than dogs and similar to me since I am not that active either\" and blah blah blah....\n\nAnd then I would think oh my gosh I could have replied that person like this, why did I just say I do not know and end the conversation???\n\nI think the reason why I have this problem of not being able to talk to people \"properly\" or making friends is because I did not have much experience when I was young (when I had selective mutism)\n\n\nAnd at work my boss would tell me to do things and sometimes I have problem remembering what my boss said, maybe because I have a bad memory, but I think its also because I am scared when they talk (?????) and I cannot focus on what they are saying so like the words come in from one ear and go out from the other lol.\n\n\nAnd then some days I would go out to eat lunch with one of my colleagues and I can be silent the whole time unless he/she asks me something. And usually the conversation ends really fast with me just saying \"I do not know\" or \"ok\" or \"yeahhhhhh\".\n\nAnd they probably think I am very weird, the weirdest person they met in their life (lol) because the i can be silent the whole day? \n\nAlso I want to tell my boss things like I have finished a task given to me or ask about some problems I encounter while doing a task but most of the time, probably 90% of the time (lol) I put off telling my boss about it. I know it is 10283730384720294% better to tell my boss about it but I am kind of scared of talking??? Like I know I can do it, but I just do not want to, I am scared, I do not really know what kind of feeling this is lol. Because of this, sometimes my boss would kind of tell me off (but luckily my boss is a nice person :) even though she probably thinks I am weirdly way too quiet lol)\n\nAnd someone told me that people say \"it is impossible to talk to me\".\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAH THAT JUST MAKES ME WANT TO CRY SOMETIMES IM just so upset sometimes and I do not know how I am going to live in the future? How am I going to survive in this world like this lol....\n\nI do not really know what to do now, its like I want to improve and be able to communicate better but at the same time I do not want to because its difficult and Im scared which is stupid but yup....\n\nWell... I do not think a lot of people will understand me but...\n\nAnyone... relates? It sounds like what you are experiencing is social anxiety, which is very common in people who have overcome SM. But fortunately, it can be managed and treated. Most people benefit from having therapy (like CBT) or from taking medicine. &gt;Like I know I can do it, but I just do not want to, I am scared, I do not really know what kind of feeling this is lol.\n\nThat is feeling is social anxiety. In fact, that is kind of the definition of social anxiety. \n\nOvercoming it takes a lot of work, dedication, and bravery, just like overcoming SM. Unfortunately, you are going to have to push yourself and it is going to be uncomfortable, but the more you push yourself the easier it will get. \n\nLike the other commenter said, you would probably benefit a lot from cognitive behavioral therapy. I caution getting on an anxiety medication or antidepressants because those can sometimes make anxiety worse, but it is something you might want to talk to your doctor about. I see! I do not know why but I never really thought I had social anxiety for some reason... thank you for that! I see! I do not have a doctor so I can only try to overcome this social anxiety by myself... That makes it a little more difficult, but you can definitely still learn to overcome it!\n\nYou might want to start doing some research on social anxiety and strategies for dealing with it \u2013 not only are there lots of strategies for coping with social anxiety, just having more information will make what you are experiencing less of a big, terrifying unknown.\n\nI also had SM as a kid that turned into GAD and social anxiety as an adult, but I have learned to overcome the social anxiety by continuing to push myself out of my comfort zone, even when it makes me uncomfortable, in order to advocate for myself and communicate when in situations like the ones you described. The more you speak up, as difficult as it is, the more confidence you will gain and it will keep getting easier. It is super difficult but I guess if I want to overcome this there is no other way! And wow, I find it amazing that you are able to push yourself, I really respect that! So do you still have GAD/social anxiety now? I do, and unfortunately, it is not something that ever completely goes away. It is just something you get better at coping with until those situations are not difficult anymore. I am pretty good in most social situations now but there are still certain situations that make me really uncomfortable. Social interactions for people like us will never be as easy as for most people, but there is a ton of progress you can make and gaining that confidence feels amazing!

I do not think half my class even knows what I sound like, and I cannot even say \u201chere\u201d in attendance anymore, and I feel like I am getting worse and worse. I do not know what to do! Help me!! \ud83d\ude2d", "How I finally overcome selective mutism Hello there! I have a wonderful experience to share. I finally broke through my selective mutism, and it may be of use for you to learn how / what happened. \n\nFirst, the background. I am 39yo now, and got \"infected\" with the silence virus when I was about 6yo. I remember it very will, because it coincided with an outburst of my alcoholic father telling me to \"shut up those sounds coming from your mouth\". My household was verbally belligerent. I was a shy and scared little boy, and I internalized the message not to speak in my father's presence. As a boy and teenager, there were many more situations where me speaking up was severely reprimanded (bad luck, I guess). And as a consequence, I simply could not speak freely anymore. I developed a case of Selective Mutism and it stuck with me into late adulthood.\n\nI could speak to my siblings, or any familiar person in a 1-on-1 setting, but the fear of being verbally destroyed by a person in authority would forever prevent me from speaking up in a group setting. No matter how much I enjoyed talking, I would completely freeze up if there were unfamiliar people around. If I was talking to someone, and another unfamiliar person joined the conversation, I would freeze up, and no longer able to speak. It is not the fear of talking, but rather the (anticipated) fear of being reprimanded for talking that killed my voice.\n\nEven among groups of very familiar people, I often would speak as little as possible. Only when I felt absolutely confident that I could speak without being reprimanded for it, I would speak. So, for 33 years, I led a life of silent loneliness, unable to interact much socially with people (despite being a very out-going person!). Yes, I made friends, when I met people 1-on-1, but in group settings, I always felt \"stuck\", I felt I wanted to speak so badly sometimes it drove me nuts. I became very depressed, even suicidal for several years (not sure if it is just related to the Selective Mutism). SM completely ruined my social life, my sex life, my family life, my relationships, and friendships, everything. I JUST COULD NOT SPEAK!\n\nI did not even know about SM until I was 38. No one ever told me I might have a \"condition\". Sure, some people remarked I was often silent when they expected me to speak. I often felt the awkwardness of not being able to speak. Some people called me \"reticent\", and they were right, though I did not want to be. That is how my journey to healing started when I began googling psychological conditions and reticence. There was one website that linked a sort of verbal reticence (shyness) to Selective Mutism. I began reading a dozen books on the topic, and BOOM, that was me. I finally understood myself, and my past, all at once.\n\nI wanted to get rid of this condition. I knew I wanted to have a fulfilling social life. I knew I was not \"shy\", I was just inhibited, reticent, unable to speak up when I wanted to. But it is one thing to become aware of your condition. It is a whole other thing to break out of it. In the end, the healing process took me 2 years. For 33 years I had not been able to express my thoughts, views, emotions, feelings publicly or in groups. I had diminshed myself to a shadow of I really was. And I wanted my life back. Here is what I did:\n\n\\- I wanted to win back my voice. So I began to read books out loud (in the privacy of my bedroom). At first, I was terrified people my hear me! Assuring myself that my neighbor's could not hear me speak (no one could), I kept doing these exercises.\n\n\\- I began learning a new language on Duolingo, giving me a justification to speak the sentences out loud. I happened to spend some time in a foreign country, and I forced myself not to waste my language study and to actually use it. So, I did--and this meant I was speaking very basic Hungarian in public. I was having minimal conversations with checkout girls, to whom I could normally speak not a single word.\n\n\\- These steps were necessary, but brought me nowhere near healing. I had to go through something I would describe as a psychological re-awakening. I had to really breach the barrier. And I had to become more CONFIDENT as a person in order to do so. So, before I began trying to speak, I began working on my confidence first. In my case, this mean going to the gym to build muscle, and also buying a mountainbike, simply to go on trail rides (which I enjoy very much). After about a year or so of physical activity, I did in fact become much more confident.\n\n\\- And that is when it finally started. Because I would kept pushing myself for nearly 1-2 years, I began having short conversations with strangers (i.e, the people who work in supermarkets, store clerks etc.). I was able to ask them for all sorts of things I needed, and even crack a joke now and then. I began noticing people take no offense whatsoever hearing my voice. People had no problem with my speech. Most returned smiles, and most enjoyed conversing with me. \n\n\\- A collected quite a lot of these \"positive interactions\" and these slowly began overriding my Selective Mutism. But I had to go one step further. One day, late at night, I went to a beach. It was cold and stormy. I was by myself, and had spent an hour before walking through the dunes. When I reached the sea shore, I was all by myself, and for some reason, I felt this intense need to just YELL at the sea. And I YELLED and YELLED and YELLED everything I felt I should yell. Lots of things came out of my mouth, good and bad, inspiring and destructive. I must have spent half an hour shouting at the sea. And it was wonderful. \n\n\\- When I felt I had nothing left to say, I continued walking along the sea shore, and I remembered something very important. That before I got Selective Mutism, I used to be a talkative kid. And I used to love singing sons, sometimes with my siblings. I remembered my favorite song--and I sang it again. I felt I re-connected with the child I once was. This brought some tears to my eyes. I embraced myself, gave myself a hug, and said, \"I have found you\" (meaning the talkative former me). \n\nThat day at the beach, at night, I found my voice again. On my way back home, some weirdo at the train station hit me on the chest--and I let it all out. Having just found my voice, I barked that mofo down like I would never done before. Everyone was watching. And I could not care less. I felt fantastic: I no longer have Selective Mutism. I breached the barrier. This is great to hear! Hopefully I can overcome my sm one day. This is beautiful! Especially the shouting at the sea!! Congratulations on your achievement I love you. This is a beautiful experience and I am so glad you shared it!! I love you too!\n\n\n\n\n\n^I ^am ^a ^bot ^trying ^to ^spread ^a ^little ^peace, ^love, ^and ^unity ^around ^Reddit. ^Please ^send ^me ^a ^message ^if ^you ^have ^any ^feedback. That post history... My origin story is similar. The people who raised me struggled with personal issues which hampered their attention to parenting. I was consistently told to be silent so I did. lol that is kind of cute Weird question, but how and what job did you get as a SM Wow.", "Work meetings I started a new job recently and I am really struggling with meetings. I had one today where I said nothing for the whole hour. \n\nI can share my ideas in email or written exchanges but in meetings I often cannot speak.\n\nI am on a temporary contract so I am wary of asking for accommodations. What should I do? Advice welcome I am not sure it will be good for your job if they know about your SM, so I think you are right not to ask for accommodations \n\n\nIs your area of expertise really needed in these meetings? I have been on multiple ones where I am just a listener who was added to the meeting for unknown reasons. If you were added on a \"just in case\" basis, I think it is ok that you are staying silent. Make sure you prepare notes if you think you will be required to speak tho. It is much easier to speak up on a meeting if the topics are fresh in your mind and right in front of you", "is this sm?/advice i guess ((currently in 8th grade)) I learned about selective mutism recently, and found that I have had some of the symptoms of it tracing back to around first grade. I have always been quiet in school, mute most of the time -- unless I am being spoken to or forced to participate.  Due to this, I am basically invisible in school, and I have never had any real close friends. I am only talkative and comfortable speaking to family, or whenever it is a one-on-one conversation. I have a fear of social embarrassment and generally feel uncomfortable talking to people because of this reason as well. I have never asked or talked to my parents about the possibility of me having selective mutism, or getting a diagnosis, but it affects me a lot, and I do not know how to overcome it. I would recommend telling your parents. Hopefully, they will then look for psychiatrists that specialize in Selective Mutism as it is quite rare. I would suggest the Child Mind Institute. They have several locations in New York City, and are opening one in San Francisco. They have a website with a plethora of resources and information. They also have a symptom checker, which is not a formal diagnosis, but if you are going to a test online, it is best to take it there. Just so you know, if the test lists something like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, do not freak. Chances are you do not have them. \nHere is the links to their websites page on SM and the Symptom Checker\n\n\n\n\n\nFyi, the symptom checker frames the question as if a parent is answering, but you can take it yourself. But I also recommend you ask your parents to fill it out as well, since they may notice things about you that you did not realize. \n\nI myself have been going to Child Mind since I was, around 8, I believe, or however old you are in 3rd grade, and am now 15, and still go. That sounds like a long time but I only go twice a year. I have taken their intensive treatment when in middle school, and it really did help me. I still struggle a lot with SM but it is an extremely difficult disorder to overcome. I also go there for Depression and ADHD, and have made tons of progress with those as well. Feel free to message me or comment if you have anymore questions, like about how the intensive treatment works or my experience with Child Mind if that will help you, or even just for some words of encouragement. \n\nI have been where you are right now, and even if you do not have Selective Mutism exactly, I still understand how it feels. It is frustrating and you may want to blame yourself, but do not. I wish you the best of luck, and hope you get the treatment you need.  I have been in your position. I eventually overcame Selective Mutism and, looking back, I think I can offer some advice. What you have definitely sounds like selective mutism but what you label it is not super important. I had selective mutism for as long as I can remember. I only spoke to immediate family and no one else. I was very afraid of embarrassment, and if I was put in a situation where I was expected to speak I simply would not. Another aspect of it for me was if I started talking I did not want people to make a big deal out of it or tell me they were proud of me (I did not want to be the center of attention), so I just did not speak. \n\nThe most important thing to remember is Selective Mutism is not something you are stuck with forever. You can and absolutely will overcome it. When I was 13 I made the decision that I was not going to except the life of a selective mute. I decided to do whatever was necessary to crush SM. You are going to have to stare your fears right in the face and say \u201cI am bigger than you!\u201d \n\nIn my experience the only way I beat SM is through internal motivation. My parents, or anyone else, telling me to start talking failed to resonate with me (mostly because I am incredibly stubborn). But when I decided I was going to start talking it was my own choice. \n\nHere is what I would recommend to start with:\n\n1. Acknowledge to yourself that you want to speak freely, without fear, and you want it more than anything. You should become obsessed with wanting to talk to people. The quality of your life will be better if you open up to people and communicate. I cannot express how much you should crave this. \n\n2. Identify a step of action you can take this week. Whether it is talking to one of your teachers or for me it was muttering \u201cthank you\u201d to a worker at Shenanigans. After taking this step, all your future interactions will be a little easier. \n\n3. Continue taking little steps to gradually open up to people. \n\nImproving your social skills is a life long journey that never ends. Once you are more comfortable talking to people you will begin to make some good friends and in my case I actually enjoy chatting with people now. I do not regret that I had Selective Mutism because it made me very independent and emotionally self sufficient. \n\nRemember, you have a whole life ahead of you; you do not want to go through it as a mute. When you break through SM and start talking to people I promise you your life will be better and, you will be unstoppable at any task you set your mind to. \n\nI could go on about this forever but I will stop here. I would be happy to answer any specific questions you have. ", "Has any one else got it from there parents mentally abusing you?  Yup Yes Yes and no. I feel like I would have had it as a child no matter what. I think with good parenting I would have grown out of it as I grew older. Yeah, emotional and physical. Does not help that I also went to a heavily catholic school where the teachers would yell constantly and hit the kids. My abusive dad left around the same time that I transferred schools and I only realised then at the age of 12 that it was not normal for adults to hit you. \ud83d\ude4b I feel like even if my dad had not had his accident that brought out the horrible person he is I would have triggered it some other way. I have noticed that in my generation &amp; the newer on both side of the extended family it is present Yes, mental and physical abuse. No but they made it worse, it is almost like I was \"born\" with it My parents were abusive too. I remember my mom used to complain about my mutism in conversations with other people and they would frequently suggest she take me to a psychologist and she would ridicule them for it. She would say that she was not going to waste a therapists time all for a tantrum and that they did not understand how my lack of speech was all about her,  an attempt to torment her.\n\nI think my early environent where my parents were volitile and detached/neglecting generated that high anxiety in me and my hesitance to speak, since there was often an unwarranted very negative/violent or cold reaction. My dad would yell at me because I also suffer from age regression/baby voice. he would tell me to stop and that it was annoying so I just stopped talking period to prevent him from getting even more upset with me. It is been a problem for over 10 years and i still struggle with both. My childhood was incredibly wholesome. My parents were great. Yes and no. I do not know if abuse caused it, though I did grow up with significant abuse. I am also Autistic, so I think my talking struggles may be related to that. Or perhaps I am not even really Autistic and all of those struggles are really caused from the abuse. Who knows? It can be hard to determine nature vs. nurture type causality. Abuse can cause a lot of different symptoms and effects everyone differently. \n\nI feel like I would have been this way anyway, but a better environment would have helped me overcome the struggles. \n\nMy parents were abusive anyway, but they treated me worse because of the way I am. It angered them if I made noise, but it also angered them when I could not speak. Basically, everything about me is wrong and always has been. My daughter is 9 and often speaks like a baby \n\nMy husband said is bc I tell her she is a big girl but will always be my baby.\n\nIs this more common than I knew?\n\nI do not want to add to her stress.  She gets nauseous when her older sister freaks out and yells.\n\nThe drs we have consulted with have never said that is a part of it.\n\nThanks, I feel terrible that I did not know It is something she would need to be diagnosed with (I think), i age regress because of things I have dealt with in passed and I have some ptsd. Idk if there is ever a way of experiencing age regression without having any form of trauma (not that she has or has not, I would not know) so I would maybe look into child therapy talking to her about seeing a school counselor if her school has one. \n\nI do know though when my family got upset over my voice, it would make me feel guilty and embarrassed because there was nothing I could do about it and I did not know why it was happening to me or that it was happening at all. \n\nAnd idk if it is \u201ccommon\u201d but I went to the store  years ago, I was about 15. There was a little girl, she looked about 10, talking like a baby to her mother, and the mom screamed at her and I felt so sorry for the little girl because I felt her pain. I did not know at the time that people dealt with that other than me. She was diagnosed with selective mutism but the police made her watch our home burn down from the backseat of a police car.\n\nAbout a year later, I was driving and thank God got pulled over bc I had no idea my car was on fire as I was driving.\n\nI got out of the car, my husband rushed there with her, I was only out of the car minutes and the front seats blew up.  They never found the cause.\n\nShe got upset and said was just happy \"that Ally (her older sister) was not there bc she would not want her sister to have nightmares about both fires.\n\nShe has not talked about in a long time but knows that we have been trying to recover financially from losing our home.  Soon after my husband was diagnosed with brain cancer and my other daughter was hospitalized for suicide attempts.\n\nI TRY to keep poker faced, I really do.  She feels things so deeply.  I have asked her if she wants to talk to someone many times and she is been very clear that she will not talk to anyone.\n\nI guess it is time to force the issue.\n\nI try to keep going like nothing is wrong and everything is normal but it is hard.   I am pulled in so many directions.\n\nI am trying to keep up and make sure that everyone is needs are met.  More than I can quantify I forget to eat until after am in bed and realize my stomach is growling.\n\nI cannot believe that I did not connect the dots.  I thought I was a good mother but I did not realize trauma could cause.  My other daughter has PTSD as do I.\n\nI must sound like an idiot that I never connected the dots until after it was pointed out.  :(\n\nHave a good night \n\nThank you so much \n\nGod bless I have self diagnosed myself with SM(with some support from my therapist that I probably have it).  \nAlthough I also suspect I am on the spectrum which she disagrees to.  \n(and have PTSD from a non family related incident)\n\n  \nMy dad has PTSD from his time in the military and was real hard on all of us as kids, he never gave me more than a slap in physical terms, but some of my friends (+me included) are scared of him to this day, and as of now I am 22.   \nHe would actually start yelling louder when I stopped talking, and then yell at my mom for talking for me. \"she can talk for her self\" kind of thing.  \nSo I do not know how it started but I definitely know my dad reinforced it.  \nFor the last year I started to learn more about SM and made me realize all the affects it had on my life...  \nAs of now I am having a lot of regression due to more anxiety, but in the past I did prove myself I can overcome it when I have to, and also kind of like the fact that now that I know why, I let myself get mute if that is what I think will be best for me. Not sure if this is mental abuse but my mom did mock me a lot when I cried. She called me stupid and worthless a lot,, so did my dad. Not really from my parents but one of my sisters friends always would tell me that no one cared about whatever I said and that hurt a lot so I guess it kind of did. I got it from being scared by having a learning and speech problem that people will make fun of me. But my mom says I didnt talk in kindergarten either so that part I am not sure but when I was older like 14 I stopped talking because of this When I was 14 i acted.like a baby little kid a lot Was it something that you could not control?\n\nThe longer we seem to go without school the more my daughter is thriving, it is very strange. I just was scared and feeling bad and wanted a lot of love and babys get that so I wanted to be like a baby again I am not perfect but unconditional love is something my children always get.  They get my attention, my youngest has not wanted to go for a walk but is excited that I found unicorns to decorate our Easter eggs Yep. Got told that she would kill me if I said another word and so I did not", "Therapy- is it working? My 8 year old has been in therapy for about 6 months for selective mutism. \n\nHow do I know if it is a right fit for her ? She does not talk to the therapist. I guess my question is how do I know it is helping in anyway? \n\nI know it is only been 6 months. What exactly will come from therapy for people with selective mutism ? I have no thoughts of pulling her from this, I am just curious. Did therapy help you overcome selective mutism? If so, how? A therapist without experience and training specifically related to selective mutism is a waste of time and money and, even worse, may be inadvertently reinforcing the mutism. Check out Thriving Minds in Michigan or one of the other organizations that specifically focus on selective mutism.", "Is selective mutism known in your country? I live in France. \n\nHere, nobody talk about SM, nobody knows it exists, even doctors, therapists.. etc. \nEverybody describes it as \"timidity\", \"inhibition\", \"a discreet person\" when they talk about it in positive way. \n\nBut most of time, a lot of people tell me I am insolent, I just refuse to speak, I want to make myself interesting. \n\nSocial anxiety has the same description. \n\nEverybody thinks it is voluntary, it is a lack of effort. \nIt is described as a thing you can change if you want but you do not because you want attention, not as an illness or a disorder. \n\nIt is hard.

How did you get help? Did it work? I live in Sweden and has never heard of am until like two days ago, and it fits in on me very well. I just thought I had social anxiety. No one really talks about social anxiety here either. No teacher has spoke about it etc. Thank you for your answer! \nAre you helped for this? Hi, I live in Berlin and you would think every therapist would be aware of it, but it is not the case. The way I found a specialist to help my daughter was looking for books about it published in Germany. Luckily there was one publication from Berlin and we chased the author of the book to get help. She is unfortunately retired but she was able to give us a name of a colleague who has experience with SM. The help of this therapist was invaluable, absolutely decisive to my daughter\u2019s recovery and I strongly suggest that you do not give up on looking for the right person to help you. Look for books, paper publications from universities, etc. It is true that SM is still very little known but I cannot believe that in France 2020 there will be no one in a position of understanding you and being able to help. \n\nI myself never knew SM existed and just wondered, why would my daughter have gradually stopped talking in the daycare, why she seemed to be a different child at home versus in social situations, I just thought she was extremely shy. It was only when a friend (who is a teacher with 20 years experience and had seen it happen at her school) told me what SM was that I could finally start to understand how serious and challenging the situation was. (Parents are usually the last to find out). \n\nI wish you every bit of success in your journey and I would like to reassure you that you can and you will get through it. If your therapy is not working, be sure that you are not the problem, but your therapist who is unprepared and unfamiliar with the methods which can actually help you out. Noo... I do not feel like there is anyone who can treat sm here, and even if there were I would probably be too scared to get help.\nWhen I google it, it does not say anything about treatment, just that kids get it. It is like it only exists in kids. I am thinking that since it is so rare( I mean no one in my family has ever heard of it), Theres probably no one who specializes in treating it. Even in the US it is not that well known or talked about. I studied psychology at university and it was brought up once in 4 years. My professor mentioned that she had no experience with it and very little is known about it. After class, I told her that I struggled with it as a child. She was fascinated and asked me a lot of questions. \n\nMy mom took me to therapy as kid where I was diagnosed, but now at 26 years old, my parents still talk about how I was \"weirdly shy\" and \"extremely timid\" - even though I had a proper diagnosis! \n\nAnyway it only affected me when i was 4 to 6 years old I think - then just devastatingly shy after that. Once I started talking my mom cancelled my therapy but I am sure it would have helped me further. I am doing good now at least. \n\nAnyway, I am sorry you are not getting proper help. I have heard France can be a little tough with treatment for mental health.\n\nHave you tried online therapy resources? I am not sure if they exist in France. I know there is something here - betterhelp . com \n\nI think it just allows you to do therapy sessions completely online. Maybe if you had a VPN service you could use it? In the Netherlands it is a diagnosis.  At the school I work at we have had a few children through the years with SM. Thank you so much for your comment. It is so helping and reassuring. I really hope your daughter is okay now. Thank you so much it is so nice. I do not know if they exist in France but I will check it, thank you. I already found a website that talk about SM and there are plenty research and writings wrote by several psychologists, there are also some books to buy. It helps me a bit. I also thought that I could send the link to my therapists so they may understand but I am too scared to do it. \nI am glad you are okay now! Yes I have the same results when I google it : it only exists in kids at school. I found several writings about treatment but it seems to be very specific at the school, so it is a bit too late for us. \nIt is sad that there is not anything for adults. Glad to hear that. It is easier for them if they are understood and helped. I know a person with selective mutism(at least I think so?) , they have autism so I do not know if that could be a part of that, but they do not talk at all in school. They write, and they also hide their face all the time. I do not think they are weird or anything, I understand, people can be overwhelming sometimes. I live in Sweden btw. I had never heard of SM before I found this subreddit. Autism and selective mutism are often linked! \nThank you for sharing :) \n\nI like Sweden with all my heart! Yay! I do not really think it is that well known anywhere. Even in the states. I live in Ohio and my mother always had to explain what it was to people when I was a child (I still have it, but it still needs explained to people)", "I have too many questions For Level 3 SM's: How do you feel about singing? My violin teacher used to always ask me to sing, and I could not, but I can answer in a few words.\n\nHave you ever had a moment that made you \"more mute\"? Like, someone reacted negatively or your friend took something the wrong way?\n\nWhat do you feel about eye contact?\n\nSorry for the weird questions. 1. I am a level one (nonverbal) selective mute, so I am unable to sing. \n\n2. I definitely have had moments where I am \u201cmore mute\u201d. It is usually when someone is bullying/teasing me or trying to force or pressure me to communicate in a way that I cannot (I.e writing, or speaking) \n\n3. Eye contact is *extremely* hard for me. I usually keep my head down with my eyes glued to the floor. If I do accidentally make eye contact with someone, even for just a second, it makes me so much more anxious than I already am. I cannot even make eye contact with people I am 100% comfortable with. Definitely cant sing, not around people. i dont think ive been made \"more mute\" by something. But some people are easier to talk to than others and im just more open with them. Eye contact is awkward for me, it used to be absolutely 0 but ive progressed to occasionally glancing at their eyes maybe holding for a brief second before looking away. 1.) I sing alone a lot. only when I am at home and I have checked every single room to make sure no one is around. I think it helped me get better at speaking loudly/projecting a bit, because I struggle with that.\n\n2.) Yes, I completely shut down sometimes based on people's reactions or behavior toward me sometimes.\n\n3.) I am fine with eye contact with people I know well, but I definitely struggle with others. especially if people are close in proximity and if they are staring very intently at me, it feels like they are boring into my soul. I have met people and had no idea what they looked like, because I never looked at their face once. Sometimes I find myself staring through people or unfocusing my eyes. 1) In school I had huge panic attacks in music class and used to pretend that I sing but would only move my mouth. Kind Of overcame that with time? Still \u201crefused\u201c singing in front of class often since I could not get a word out and just tried to explain I cannot do it.\nI am in a theater group now. And rehearsal and speech improvement practice in the group is hard. When I am confident in my text and play the character, it feels like it is not me. But I can only practice the lines with 1-2 people who I feel comfortable with and still get that clogged up feeling of not getting words out a lot.\n\n2) I learned in therapy to try and explain my feelings with describing it vaguely as best as I could and not trying to find \u201cperfect words\u201c since I would focus on that too much. But that leads to a lot of miscommunication and especially in arguments I want to get my direct point across which makes me \u201cmore mute\u201c? I had a lot of friends trying to force a direct answer out of me which leaded to my head being so clogged up that I cannot get anything out and feeling like it forces me to stop to not make it worse. Resulted in avoiding friends and arguments or straight up ghosting until the argument gets kind of forgotten and I pretend that there was never something that bothered me.\n\n3) I avoid it. I look at my hands or slightly away when I do not know the person. Or look above their head or on their hairline etc. but knowing that they look me in my eyes makes me nervous. I look on my friends faces but not in their eyes too, I think? Cannot sing audibly or anywhere near others. Mouthing the words when I am alone is possible, though. \nCertainly have had experiences that tightened up the constraints sm puts on me. There is a direct correlation between how stressful a situation is and how unable I am to communicate, verbal or otherwise.\nEye contact sucks, and is only really possible for me due to dissociation. Even then, I am sure it does not come off as natural. (BACKGROUND) 17 male\n\nI have sm sometimes it depends mostly talking to my dad or ordering fast food or talking on the phone )\n\n\n1 I can sing no problem in my room or anywhere I have no idea why \n\n2 I have it  mostly around my dad , I know exactly what I want to say and cannot it, or ordering fast food or taking to people at restaurants really anyone I am most close with , if I know them I am not at nervous besides my dad he shit. \n\n3.

So I do not have an official diagnosis unfortunately. I have always been \u201cthe shy kid\u201d but it did not really effect me to badly until about 7th grade when I became especially shy around this one specific teacher. (I just thought it was related to issues revolving around my fear of male/father figures, and the teacher being very extroverted) However this pattern continued all throughout my schooling; my brain singles out  one specific teacher, I feel like I cannot talk to them, they pick on me and make it worse accidentally, until I am completely mute. Then I would go onto the next grade and the cycle would start all over again with a new person. \ud83d\ude14 \nMy strange behavior left my feeling isolated, out of control, and different from everybody else. \nFortunately however, in 11th grade the new teacher I could not talk to suggested that I should get counseling so I did! Ever since then I began talking to them, and becoming less shy of a person all together! :) \nEven though I am doing much better now as an 18 year old. I still feel different from other people sometimes and I still freeze up in front of certain people.

My significant other and one of my friends both have anxiety. Whenever they have an anxiety/panic attack, I feel useless because I just stand there silently worrying while other friends are helping. \nI am not really sure how to help them; I have not had many anxiety attacks myself, and usually they just sit in a quiet spot or my significant other will go find his sister. \nIs there anything I could do, even though I cannot say anything and I get scared I am going to make it worse? I think you could ask before hand what they would like you to do. For example, some people find hugs help them when they are having an anxiety attack. That, or finding a way to remove them from the situation/thing causing the attack. These are just some examples, finding out what your SO/friends prefer is key to being prepared when it happens. Knowing their triggers is also helpful if you do not already. Hope I could help, good luck! \n\nEdit: If you are not able to speak at the time you do not have to verbally ask of course, sending a text/email is a good idea if you want to be more detailed.

When he came in and started asking questions, he was very quiet and murmuring. It did not help that he had an accent. I had to ask him what he said more than once.\n\nHe asked why I had a high bpm and the only thing I could say was \"I guess I am nervous and I worked myself up.\" with an awkward laugh. He asked me why I was nervous and I could not speak. He did it again when a few moments passed of me opening my mouth and closing it like an idiot, then I just started to cry. He told me to change my medicine because 'you would not be crying right now if nothing was wrong'.\n\nI am so frustrated, either with myself or him, I had not had a panic attack in months and have not been irrationally anxious at all. I have made a lot of progress to where I am now and I do not want to change my medicine since it is been working well. I am afraid he will be mad if he sees I had not listened to him to change it though. I felt like I was being talked down to like the last appointment and he did not take me seriously and only helped me so I would stop crying - which only worked because I could focus on the headache calender he handed me instead of making eye contact with him.

No, there is even an option in the survey if you have an unofficial diagnosis/suspect that you have it. :) Thanks!", "\"Why are you so quiet all the time?\" I plead the fifth Wow. Such a simple question brings up sj many painful memories. I was fine with my family most of the time. I learned very quickly how to read a person. My father was an alcoholic, and within 1 beer, he would become my dad\u2019s replacement. This evil asshole. We were tortured for hours until my mom came home. We had to sit there and listen to is garbage. \nThat reinforced my selective mutisivm. \nWhen my kid sister was around, I would stand behind her, and she would do whatever I asked of her. Especially, when it came to dealing with grown ups. \nWhenever we had to deal with family members it was \u201cwhy do not you ever saying anything?\u201d \u201cor why are you so shy\u201d it just made me feel defective and further removed from the human race. \nAt 36, I just dgak.

I struggled mainly through my childhood with SM and just realized now that I have no internal monologue and that all my thoughts are just super abstract and conceptual. My girlfriend and I thought this could possibly be related so any responses are helpful Yeha i have an internal monologue... yep I have one and it never really stops. I am super wordy in my my head and it tends to show in my writing as well. I have always been a big reader so that may have contributed to my overall vocabulary. However, ever since I was young, often times the words or phrases I want to say never come out the way they are supposed to. The words are either badly formed, the intended message is too garbled or I lost my train of thought as soon as the words left my mouth. It is incredibly embarrassing to be honest. \n\nThat being said lots of people may not have such an internal monologue and do think in a more conceptual way, including those with SM. Pretty much the same as you.  \nI would even say It is like a never ending river of thoughts and conversations in my head...   \nAnd specially the part about when you do manage to speak it does not turn out as intended. I get that  \nLike in my head everything makes sense but putting it into the right words when I talk does not come naturally at all, makes first impressions extremely hard... Often make myself look like an Idiot From what i have read about the lack of internal monologue it seems fairly uncommon (seemingly less than 1 in 10) and of the people i have asked so far im the only one without. I thought i could be onto something here but i will see if anyone else responds Yes, this is exactly what I mean! First impressions always terrified me and I always avoided meeting new people because of this. Conceptual thinking sounds really cool to be honest, I wondered what it could be like when I first saw this post. It sounds unique and interesting! It is interesting that you ask this, because I just read an article about internal monologues two days ago. I never knew people actually heard themselves speak in their head. I think more abstractly, Everyone else in my family has an internal monologue. Including my selective mute daughter. I often think in a way as if I was talking to a person I know, so when I think about idk, why something interests me I kind of roleplay in my head and explain it to that person. So it is a full dialogue going on constantly. Its honestly just a different normal. I feel like it explains why im terrible at reading comprehension but really good at math though. I just kind of thought my brain was unbalanced but this makes alot more sense Same here - I have always had a stream of consciousness narration in my head. I have also read and written a lot my whole life, so that may add to it. I am no longer mute, but the internal monologue has persisted during and after my experience with SM. I do have one, but mostly because I love reading and did not really develop selective mutism until I was 10 (I currently still have it) I did not use to have an inner monologue as a child, but for the most part, I developed one as I got older. Sometimes I still do think in abstract notions and concepts. I do this, too. I have always thought it was a hangover from having imaginary friends as a kid. I do not have SM but think I had it until around age 10, specifically in situations when I was being yelled at/verbally attacked. During those situations, I remember feeling not only that my voice was \"frozen\" but also that there were no words in my head to answer even if I had been able to voice them. \nThe rest of the time I think I had words running all over my head, though. I noticed that when I was not focusing on my mental health, I thought more abstractly. It is like I was aware of what I was thinking about and could put it into words in my head if I had to but did not have the mental energy perhaps? I think that maybe this could be used as a diagnostic tool in the future ? But who knows what significance it holds for now. I think I would prefer thinking in a monologue because it probably helps with socializing and putting your thoughts into words. I do not necessarily think that one is superior to the other as long as it does not feel\nlimiting. I would say that right now it is a mixture of monologue, abstract thought, and visualization. I am glad people are giving this attention and surprised our society has not addressed it earlier.", "was cocaine in small doses ever been tried on selective mutism children? all those chicken a victim of the system Cocaine and other substances would never in today's age be tried as a \"solution\" or \"cure\" to any psychological condition.

I am so depressed and things are crashing down on me right now. I feel like all I do is sit in my room and cry while other people my age are having fun. HELP!!!!! I NEED TO ACE THIS PROJECT!! I was in exactly the same situation as you last year, my teacher assumed that because I spoke to my friends in class that where was \u2018nothing wrong with me anymore\u2019 so she made me do it in front of the whole class still, even though she let other people(who do not have selective mutism and we are just nervous apparently) do it 1-1 just with her instead of in front of the whole class, for me one of my friends gave me a cbd sweet, I know that might not be an option for you or if it is even legal there but it is legal here and it genuinely really helped just taking one, and it is the only time I have ever had one because it just got me through that presentation. Another thing that helped me was telling my friends that were in my class about my presentation before doing it. A lot of my fear was about my friends reaction, so by having them know everything about it before actually doing it it helped me a lot, obviously I was still incredibly nervous but a lot less than usual still Thank you! I forgot about cbd. It is legal here but my mom will not let me get it. Wish I could take one gummy candy or something Yeah I have not even bothered asking my parents because I know they would say no, I would never even thought about cbd until the day of the presentation when I was massively stressing and one of my friends had some. I have never had any since but I might get some when I can, I do not think you actually have to be 18 to buy them (or at least some online sites do not ask for id) in some places so I guess if you have your own money maybe you could buy some online or something? Email your school counselors and teacher to explain your situation and feelings to get accommodations. It is your legal right that the school does what they can even if they cannot necessarily cancel it. I was in the same place so I got the minimum number of people and could choose my audience. Use the upcoming days to focus on your goal and determination to pass this class/proving yourself instead of the people listening. Personally I prepare and practice as if it is a written essay, then I will focus only on the content as I present. I never make eye contact but I will look between heads or behind people. Right now, the goal is to pass, not to be an amazing presenter. You got this. I am sorry your mother is being abusive. I hope you know that you are not a loser and you are not a failure, even if you were to fail this project. 45 minutes is long for a presentation, and I do not think I would have been able to do it.\n\nIf you have not already, it might be a good idea to talk to (or email) your teacher about your concerns. They might be able to help. Otherwise, would it be possible to record yourself ahead of time and use that instead of speaking, to get around volume issues? Just an idea.\n\nI wish I had better advice, but anyway I hope you do well at your presentation. I had to take public speaking in college in order to graduate.\n\nI would try to talk to your teacher first about your anxiety and selective mutism to see if they would be willing to let you present just to them privately or have you record your presentation.\n\nWorst case scenario and you have to present these are some things you can try that helped me to pass:\n\n* Record yourself to see if you get hung up on words so you can change it to something you know you will not mess up easily.\n* Use the recording to also time yourself! (Reading quietly at the speed of light to get it over with is always a problem). Nothing worse then, \"I could not hear you! Start again and be louder this time!\" If your time limit is 45 aim for 50 or more just in case you still end up panic rushing.\n* It helps IMMENSELY when using a paper to write LOOK UP and PAUSE after periods or sentences/ paragraphs. Teachers love that stuff and it gives you a moment to breathe and think while also helping add to your time.\n   * I also put HALFWAY in mine to motivate me to finish AND give you an idea if you need to slow way down (panic reading too fast).\n* Use a pencil or an index card to cover up what you have already covered so you do not say the same thing again and get flustered.\n* Practice with a friend or family member with them pretending to be the audience. That way you can think of them sitting there instead of your class.\n* \\*\\*Bonus if you have glasses\\*\\*\n   * Every time I had to present I would take off my glasses so I did not get frozen looking at the other students. A lot easier to look at a bunch of blobs instead of eyes.\n\nEdit: I would ask your doctor if they would be willing to up your prozac or switch you to something else if you still feel such anxiety. \n\nI hope this project goes well for you! Thank you so much How did it go? It was okay, mostly eh. Good thing I passed I was just looking for an old comment and remembered your post, how did it go in the end?

Feel guilty, lost and at a brick wall Ever since I finished high school my selective mutism made a return to my life with a vengeance. I had it back in the start of high school \nand had, as most people do, got over it for a few months, but quickly after HS it came back to where I could not talk to anyone except my family and people at my job, and now it just got to the point where I cannot speak to anyone outside of my family.\n\nI have been hiding it for as long as I could but I am worried they will find out. I ended up telling them I got a new job (which I cannot really do, on account of being unable to communicate) They do not really understand communication issues or mental issues, or anything really so telling them would be more damage than anything else. I do not know what to do. I cannot tell them, when I try to I get super afraid and my voice just cannot come out. I feel guilty lying to them, but the thought of telling them gets me super anxious and I have had a bunch of nightmares where opening up to them makes me lock up when trying to speak to them just like everyone else, so that discourages me too.\n\nI had to go outside with them the other day to celebrate my mothers birthday and they all told me I was being really weird and to talk. My sisters boyfriend also grabbed me suddenly as he laughed loudly and told me to brighten up and speak, which just kind of locked me up for a few seconds. Most scared I have been all year, lol.\n\nAnd every attempt I made to test the waters with telling them has ended badly.\n\nTried hinting it to my mother on the way home that I cannot really speak to people and she just told me I was not trying hard enough.\n\nTalked to my brother about my issues speaking once while I was on the phone and he told me to \"get over this introvert phase\" and that kind of hurt since it is an actual issue and not just an angsty phase.\n\nAnd my sister just makes fun of me, called me an idiot, dumb, asked if I was retarded.\n\nHonestly It all just kind of sucks and discourages me from telling them anything about it.\n\nAnyone ever been in a similar boat?\n\n(sorry for the wall of text I erased and rewrote this like 45 times to get the wording right) Your family is ignoring your feelings and I know how hard is to get through that. You definitely  need therapy or at least someone who understands. You can talk to me if you want!\n\nI also suffered from SM, recovered by myself, but right after I turned 18 (I am now 22), it came back and I could not talk at the University. It seemed fine at first, but then I started to accumulate all these feelings of anger and guilt and my family could not stand it. We were fighting all the time and fortunately I moved in with other part of the family that was more understanding. Even there I could not fully recover, but at least I had alone time and spent more time with my boyfriend. Our relationship was just starting then, so I was afraid to talk about certain things, but I found in him that someone at the time, and he was trying to get better, as well.\n\nI tell you, again, you can talk to me, I know how hard it is. Man, I am so sorry your surrounded by people who do not get it. That is super frustrating and makes it that much harder to recover. I did not know it was a real thing for YEARS. I just thought like your family thinks that I was broken or just not trying hard enough. Maybe show them a legit source of info on it like a Dr's book or Wikipedia or something. Once they know what it is and that it is no BS maybe hopefully they will be more understanding. Rooting for you!  That is a tough spot to be in... Based on the reactions you have already gotten from your family, it is completely understandable that you are having such a hard time telling them that your SM has picked up again. \nThe best you can do, though, is try to educate them. Get some information from the Selective Mutism Association website (they post regularly on their Facebook, too). Maybe get some information about anxiety in general, too (try the NIMH site), like how it is an - irrational- response that you have little to no control over.\nHopefully, presenting them with real, researched information will help your family to understand and be more supportive. ", "Selective Mutism AND Autism??? I have been told that the two cannot co-exist. Is that true? \n\nSometimes I wonder if I have ASD and was just misdiagnosed as a child, or if it could be possible that I have both. I am just not sure and I am too scared to talk to my doctor about it. I am pretty certain they can definitely coexist, I have even heard it is common. I would do some research. Who tf told you they cannot exist together? Sounds like they have a weird notion of what these two things are. I would figure that autism carries a higher than average risk of comorbidity with selective mutism, much like it does with depression and many forms of anxiety When I went down a rabbit hole of research I found multiple studies saying they cannot coexist. There are studies trying to prove they do as well. I believe the handbook used by therapists (cannot think of the name if it) states the same thing. It is so confusing. I think they can co-exist. I have (sort of) been diagnosed with selective mutism and currently in the process of getting my autism diagnosis. \n\nI guess that its really case dependent, because autism is known for causing people to be unable to speak. While some people with autism cannot speak at certain times its not always selective mutism but sometimes I would think that it is selective mutism. It could also be the difference between what is causes them to not be able to speak. I hope that makes sense :) My son was officially diagnosed with both SM and ASD lvl 2. They can definitely coexist. I am diagnosed with SM and in the process of getting one for ASD, they can exist together", "Wondering if I have Selective Mutism Hello, I have been wondering if I have Selective Mutism lately.\n\nWhat makes me think about this is that sometimes when I get so overwhelmed by something, I just shut down. (I have autism and add if that helps at all) I feel like I cannot speak and if I do try, it almost hurts to do so. Not like the ouchie hurt, but like that bad feeling in your throat kind of hurt. I apologize if it is too vague. But it is already a little troubling for me to meet eye contact with people but it is especially hard when I shut down like this. The only way that I feel comfortable communicating is with my s/o by writing or typing or with the school councilor. It has not gotten that bad in a while but the fear of not being able to talk kind of scares me because I am usually a rather talkative person.\n\nWith the zoom calls, I have only really had one situation that I can recall at the moment. I was put into a breakout room with someone I have a little bit of a stupid grudge on, but pretty much a few minutes after I was put into the breakout room with him, I just turned off my mic and did not talk at all. I just kind of....did not want to. I am not sure if that situation in particular was selective mutism, but do with the information as you will. \n\nIf you have read through all this, thank you for taking the time and have a pleasant day everyone &lt;3 Yeah I think I get what you mean about the bad feeling in your throat, I find I get that too when it happens and then I just cannot make myself talk no matter how hard I try and when I do it is either a whisper or just one word Exactly, that is kind of how it feels for me as well", "Help.. I would this true I think my mom is a narcissist but I also had selective mutism in preschool and found an article saying selective mutism is linked to narcissism and avoident personality disorder I think\n\n\n\nNow I am really scared and freaked out that I was the narcissist. I mean I know my mom was wrong a lot but it is still scary to read. It says sm is linked to vulnerable narcissism and avpd :( \n\nI plan on going to therapy bc my parents parenting, anxiety/adhd/ocd/depression/social anxiety/self esteem/ fearful avoidant  attachment style. I guess I should bring this up too. I know narcissistic fleas will defect narcissists kids but I hope that I am not pathologically a narcissist are you saying SM is comorbid with narcissism? I have never seen that in any official literature. Do not worry about it Eh, that is not official literature. It is already been discovered that Selective Mutism is an anxiety disorder, and does not have anything to do with NPD. I would not trust an article that rambles on and equates social anxiety or avoidant personality disorder with narcissism because they are allegedly \u201cchoosing\u201d to avoid people based on their own fears. This article makes me angry to read. This 'practitioner' is the one who is lacking in empathy. He claims that people with avoidant personality disorder are really just narcissists in disguise because, according to him, they put their intense fears over everybody else's needs. That is NOT selfish, inconsiderate and narcissistic, as this man seems to suggest. Avoidant personality disorder and narcissism are different and to suggest otherwise is cruel to people living with the disorder and on his part suggests a lack of empathy for others. First of all, a narcissist is lacking in neuroticism. Someone with avoidant personality disorder and selective mutism is HIGH in neuroticism. That is, they are often consumed by anxiety, self doubt, ruminations etc. Narcissists and psychopaths and sociopaths usually do not care about the fact that they are causing harm to others and do not self-reflect or obsessively worry and doubt in the way that neurotic people do. Second of all, he is conflating low levels of functioning with selfishness, which is wrong of him. He thinks that people with avoidant personality disorder who are unable to cope with social situations and chose to flee show narcissistic tendencies compared to someone who forewarns others that they cannot do the meeting or are going to leave etc. Does this man not take into consideration that these people who show more selfish tendencies are so anxious that a more considerate way of 'avoiding others' is not possible for them until they have recovered more from their anxiety and trauma? Bold move to just say that they are being selfish and only thinking of themselves and their problems without considering that maybe it is just impossible for them in their state. Sometimes your anxiety and levels of functionality are impaired by having a serious mental health disorder, and that does impair your ability for empathy, but it does not make you an inconsiderate narcissist.  People with selective mutism fall into this category, they cannot speak to others, and sure, maybe technically they are putting their own needs first by not talking to avoid discomfort, and maybe it is upsetting to OTHER people, and maybe people with selective mutism should try to consider how that might inconvenience others, but you see that is just ridiculous because people with selective mutism are not CHOOSING to be inconsiderate, rather they literally CANNOT accommodate the needs of others because their anxiety is so all-consuming and overwhelming. That does not mean they are self-absorbed or only focus on themselves, what a ridiculous and cruel assertion.", "My online teacher will not let me use chat I am currently doing an online class for school and I only took it so I can ask questions via chat or email and feel safer but she does not understand my SM is a mental illness. I am barely able to talk and she wants me to at least say, \"miss\" to get her attention so she can enable chat. This just is not possible and she is not working with me. She said, \"I cannot allow the chat since I cannot monitor it because it is like in a class where you can just get off-topic.\"My other classes let me use chat and get to know people so this is a huge burden. She simply does not understand it is a mental illness and it is giving me a lot of anxiety. I am currently undergoing therapy and mental rehabilitation to allow me to be able to talk more. I have not been able to talk to teachers for 10 years so I just simply cannot just talk like it is nothing. I am probably going to fail because I will refuse to ask questions, etc. I only took online to gain my social confidence because this talking thing is hitting me now and just going up to someone is new. She also said when no one was answering her, \"I can sit here all day you staring at my face and me staring at your profile picture until someone unmutes and talks\"\n\nI do not know what to do and I am having so many panic attacks. Talking away the chat takes away my safe place for me to know I have a safe place to \"talk\" but now I feel more forced and when I feel forced it makes me a lot more anxious.\n\nEdit: She said she does not want to do the in-class program as she is having surgery soon but she is refusing to adapt to how it works or try to figure out ways to help me a bit.\n\nEdit 2: **Thank you, everyone, she said she is going to come up with a way to incorporate the chat as me including others feel more comfortable using it instead.** Have you tried taking it up a notch to the boards, if she thinks she can treat you and the class like that maybe the boards will make her listen...\n\nMail them maybe?\n\nSorry I am not much of help, teachers like her sucks to all students with mental health issues SM or not.  Hi, thanks! They do know it is in my student information but she does not understand still, I have contacted my social worker to see if she can work with me.  \n\n\nAlso, that sounds horrible! I am so sorry to hear, if that happened to me I would go insane. I hope you are doing better now. Hi, thanks! Yes, I have contacted my social worker to make chat available even if she cannot monitor it to help. Thankfully someone else replied but I am anxious I am going to get pointed out or directly asked something. I am pretty sure that is actual discrimination that she can get in legit trouble for. They will not let you fail a class due to a medical condition if reasonable accommodations were asked for and not given. Just email your school counciler and try to get into contact with the disability office. The school does want a lawsuit and likely will not take the chance Maybe, I have messaged my social worker to see if there is a way I can still communicate while in class. It does annoy me every time she misses a question in the chat when she does have it on and says, \"and that is why I like to have you use microphones.\"\n\nI do not know man that sounds like a you problem to me \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 - to my teacher not you lol, to clarify Which country are you in? Canada, also I have found a solution and it has been resolved. Unless something further happens it is okay now! Thank you. Are you in college?  If so, you should reach out to the disability services office and they can advocate for you and put a plan in place that your professor would need to accommodate.  If you are in high school, (which I do not get the feeling you are, but maybe other people will read this and it will help them)  reach out to your counselor. You qualify for a 504 plan in public school, which would require your school and teachers to make accommodations so you can access the curriculum. I am happy to hear about that! It is a fair concern, I think you need to start thinking about a strategy on how to deal with that situation in case it does come up. Better be safe than unprepared right? Yes 100% Thank you so much for this information! This is sure to be helpful for many people. Yes, I have the situation resolved now.. at least for now.", "Need help So in about a week my older brother is coming to visit but I cannot talk to him i have not been able to talk to him for years and I do not know why just recently I have been able to talk to him over voice chat but not in person I want to talk to him when he comes to visit but I am worried I will not be able to again. I presume your brother knows about your sm? Make sure you have a backup communication plan. Hopefully he will be understanding. Make sure there are hugs!!", "Trying not to lose a long distance friend He keeps pressuring me to talk on the phone and does not understand why I prefer to communicate by email or text message. He confessed he had feelings for me and I was open to that, but he then emailed finally that if I cared about him in the same way I would \"want to hear his voice too\" and he accepts that now. Now he keeps sending me weird texts about just wanting to be friends. But I am afraid I will lose him as a friend too. I am so tired of being misunderstood by people. Having things wrongly projected onto me. People have called me stuck up, people have nicknamed me \"ghost\".  In school they kept testing me to see if I was learning disabled. I am just so tired of trying to explain myself. Does anyone else get this from extreme anxiety? Because for me talking is not only exhausting but very anxiety producing. I am not even able to work right now. I am essentially crippled by my anxiety this year. Some years are harder than others. I am so lonely though and wish people could be open to communicating on my terms by text or email. Am I the only one? What things get projected onto you wrongly? I am really hurt by all the things people project onto me and assume about me just because I am quiet. It sounds like this guy is trying to manipulate you into doing something you do not want to do, that is a big red flag right there. \n\nThat shit is not cool and you do not have to put up with his behaviour. If he does not respect your feelings then that is his problem not yours. If someone is not willing to be friends with you accepting you as you are, they are not really your friend. It is not like you are being unkind, you have a genuine disability. If they cannot accept that, it is not your fault or your problem. They are not being a friend to you. i agree, they are totally manipulating them to feel guilty I have also had some of my friends pressure me to send voice messages, and it sucks. I forced myself to do it once and I felt like shit.\n\nDoes he know that you have selective mutism? You should tell him first. \n\nIf he still keeps asking you, then I think the best thing to do is to cut the friendship honestly. \nThere is no point in keeping a friendship if someone cannot respect boundaries. Just ditch the people who try to pressure you, they will keep pushing for more. It is not worth it. I had a lot of people like that back when I was in my teens and I really regret keeping them around just to have some friends. Thank you for all your replies. It sure is hard to make and keep friends with this condition. It is comforting to find people who understand. Listen, when I was still SM as a teenager, I chatted with a bunch of good people on a forum, whom I met up with at some point and became IRL friends with, and are still now my friends, and even though some of them were frustrated with me not talking, some of them were absolutely fine with it, did not pressure me to talk or call, and often told me they liked me mute or not. THESE are the (rightfully unicorns) people you want around you while you are still trying to get better, and not the ones making you feel bad about yourself.  \nBe open about your condition, and if they are not accepting you it is not going to work :)  \nThey are not necessarily bad people, since SM can be difficult to understand and deal with, but they are not good for you, so let it go if he does not respect you, ok? )) He does not sound like a real friend if he cannot respect boundaries. If he only is your friend because he has feelings for you, he also is not a friend. I do not want to alarm you, but he sounds very manipulative. I would let that 'friendship' die. Thanks for the advice. I just do not have many friends at all so was trying to keep one. You are most likely right.", "School Experiences Did anyone else with SM go through these things in elementary to high school? (I would leave to hear similar experiences\u2014for some reason elementary school had a lot of these things for me.) \n\n-Doing presentations during recess or lunch in front of the teacher or with very close classmates\n-When the substitute calls your name and everyone answers \u201cHe/She does not talk\u201d \n-Popcorn reading or reading aloud, and when it was your turn the person next to you read for you \n-Staying inside for recess \n-Being a favorite from the teacher for being quiet, despite literally not saying a word \n-Classmates asking if you can talk or are actually mute \n-Crying if nobody understood you could not talk (usually happened when I was very little) Yep yep. Having to \u201cgo to the bathroom\u201d just before your name was called for popcorn reading so you did not have to read aloud even though you read faster and more accurately than most other students. In elementary school my voice all of a sudden became a whisper (never knew it was SM until a few months ago) so when I did read aloud or do a presentation there would be at least 5 classmates that would say something along the lines of \u201cI cannot hear her!\u201d Oh god you mentioning going to the bathroom/I cannot hear her has brought up some memories! I clearly remember running away to the bathroom so many times haha. And yes people always commented too Even still my voice is not it is strongest, if ever I decide to pitch in on a conversation and my mom is next to me they usually look to her and ask \u201cwhat did she say?\u201d As though I am speaking a foreign language. This was a constant occurrence in elementary/middle school. I did this too. I went to the bathroom every class. Honestly I think I spent more time hiding in the bathroom than I did in class lol Haha same here YES i had all of these experiences throughout all of elementary!!\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d luckily i had very understanding teachers who did favour me over most kids (bc i didnt talk or cause any trouble lol) and i am fortunate to have recovered at the start of middle school but i feel sad knowing the peak of my childhood was taken from me. elementary school is supposed to be the childhood bliss of our lives where we have the least worries and most of us with SM never got to experience it because we spent most of it in school, a very stressful environment. looking back now, i feel like that area of my life was very stressful and one of the worst. omg I feel the exact same way! down to when I recovered and everything, I started talking (not a whole lot) in middle school too. I really feel you about missing out in elementary, I really feel like that was a vital time in my life to build social skills and I missed out on it. I hope you are well now!! X \"Why do not you talk?\" I feel rage hearing this now.  \ud83d\ude20 I even once had a teacher (who previously I thought was very nice ) asked if I did not talk because I was stuck up and thought I was better than everyone else. I felt so ashamed and humiliated after that, I felt like crying. Did not exactly help my already super low self esteem. School was hell. Oh my I also feel angry hearing that phrase too...it is the same level as \u201cOh my god she talks\u201d and that teacher sounds like they suck. I still hope you had understanding teachers, even though there is only a few. All of them until high school! My teacher used to hold my nose so that I would open my mouth and talk after 6 years... questionable technique. Hm that is very questionable. I do not think you should pressure anyone with SM to talk, in my opinion. Yup. Yes, I have had tons of these annoying experiences. In elementary school, people were lenient and friendly towards me and usually spoke in my stead. Once I got to middle and high school, ppl got more judgy and I was ostracized. Also, i can really relate with the \"can u talk\" comment, bc its so fucking annoying. like how am i supposed to answer??\n\nbut yeah, ur not alone. except for the presentations, i had no choice other than doing it in front of the class since all my teachers were assholes. i also forced myself to do presentations since if i was the only one who didnt do it in front of the class, i was afraid that everyone would notice and deepen their hatred towards me I hate the \u201cCan you talk\u201d question so much! And I can definitely feel you with the presentation parts, after elementary I just sort of forced myself to do them (even though I am pretty sure nobody heard me)  I audibly gasped. this was EXACTLY my life in school.

(Slight vent) I have been SM since I was a kid, I am 22 now and things have gotten better but I have my bad days and triggers. My biggest problem is strangers and just going in public. I learned a few things in ASL to say things like 'thank you', 'yes/no', and 'I am mute'. I also have a medical alert ID that says I am a SM (I have CPTSD and can have severe physical symptoms so the ID is not strictly for being a SM).\n\nI noticed that the few times I use sign (usually to tell employees and strangers that I cannot talk) people are either really nice or look at me like I am a freak. It is kind of made me not even want to learn fluent sign because so many people do not understand. I find myself making stuff up or just using a notepad app on my phone if I really have to. \n\nMy last experience with sign was pretty bad. For context, I have a service dog that usually stays home with me because I am a shut in but he is trained for public access so I took him to a grocery store with me. I was mute at the time because it was just a bad day and that was another reason I took my boy. I ended up getting cornered by three employees (all in there late 40s to 50s) trying to coo over my dog. One even had one of those big floor wax machines and it startled my boy so I tried to keep my distance. \n\nI signed at the trio that I was a mute (my SD has a vest patch for SM too and I pointed it out) but they rolled their eyes and kept asking my questions. I ended up bailing because my dog was starting to get a bit antsy and blocking them from me since it was stressing me out. I heard them complain a bit about me as I walked away. Basically that I was rude or faking and they even mentioned my looks. Now I am an alternative looking guy with a SD, so at a glance I am kind of a bold appearance in my town. But it seems to just make it harder to sign because everyone expects this rock/metal looking guy to just say anything on his mind. \n\nSorry if this is long winded, this is my first post here. I honestly did not know a group like this was on reddit but I am glad it is. I also learned a few things in ASL to help myself with the struggle, but in most of my experience, nobody else seems to want to care about that. I am so sorry you had to go through that, by the way, it sounds very stressful. Have a good rest of your day Learn it. If nothing else, I have found when I meet deaf people they love that I even try to communicate with them in sign, which is limited to, \u201cnice to meet you\u201d, \u201cI am sorry\u201d, \u201cthank you\u201d.", "Upcoming Events across the US, Selective Mutism Association - there are many treatment-focused camps in the US. ", "What is the cause of selective mutism What causes this in a kid whose preeschool aged? Especially if the kid does not have language issues and is able to communicate when absolutely necessary? For example, the child was too nervous to ask to go to the bathroom so they peed their pants. But when the child needed to take their hoodie off they walked up to the teacher and asked if it was okay for them to take the hoodie off. Is it strange that the child felt the need to ask the teacher if she could take her hoodie off when she was wearing an under shirt? It is anxiety based. Not necessarily sm. That kid could just have a specific anxiety related to going to the washroom, like the biological need kicked in and his brain got overwhelmed. I dont think sm would be that selective Well no they have selective mutism and a diagnoses. I am just  asking why a kid developed sm so young (before preschool).. especially if the kid is \u201ccapable\u201d of communicating and does not have any signs of serious disability. I have heard about bullying causing selective mutism but how can it be caused if the kids so young Sm is not caused by trauma. It is anxiety based. What causes anxiety. I will tell you after I pick up my Nobel prize. Likely the child feels some sort of shame or embarrassment over 'bathroom' topics or more private sorts of questions. There may be something in their life that caused this feeling or it may just be a natural manifestation of anxiety. I do not think people really understand how unnatural school environments are for children and how many of them feel uncomfortable in strange ways when exposed to them There are two ways of dealing with trauma that people usually have. Trauma can cause depressive symptoms and depression or anxiety and extreme stress surrounding things related to the trauma. Most have some level of a mix of both. If a kid gets bullied their trauma symptoms most often revolve around what they were bullied about and the locations they were bullied in. Anxiety does show up without trauma *too*, those other reasons are vastly not understood, but stress and anxiety are inherently linked so people get anxiety following their ptsd or cptsd. SM is an anxiety disorder. Most people who have SM are born with it. It is not caused by bullying or trauma. It does however have very strong hereditary links ( is an anxiety disorder as others have mentioned. It is mostly common in children with ( (BI). You can have a BI temperament and NOT have selective mutism, but if you are \"born\" with SM, it is likely you have a BI temperament. BI temperaments are linked to anxiety (other forms of anxiety like social anxiety or generalized anxiety); selective mutism is just one form of anxiety linked with BI temperaments. \n\nTemperaments are measurable in research by about 3 months of age and has nothing to do with normal development. Meaning, a child's speech and language do not have to be inhibited or delayed due to temperament or SM.\n\nThe selective part of SM means that the child will talk in specific situations and will not talk in other situations. The bathroom situation was a no-talk zone and the hoodie was a talk-zone! A therapist might be better suited to answer exactly why a particular child has a particular talk-zone or no-talk-zone :)\n\nMy 3.5 year old would definitely be diagnosed with SM if I sought the diagnosis. She is also a big rule follower but I do not always understand the rules she is following. She asks permission to do stuff that I never would have thought she would need to ask about, but in her head, she needs to ask. I do not think it is strange at all, just a little different from the typical kiddos out there and most likely linked her particular brain! Could be related to another form of anxiety. I have ocd and I remember having trouble asking my teachers for permission to do things when I was around that age. Try finding the root source of the child's anxiety; are they afraid of getting in trouble?", "Any links to having a below average PP? Hi guys, I am a 20 year old recently diagnosed SM.

However, this is a genuine concern of mine so please approach it with an open mindset.

I hope I am not the only one who feels this way, so I thought I would be the first one to voice my concern and see if others relate. You are right. I am smelling a troll.

I was in a casual setting talking to one of my friends who is on track to become a psychiatrist and as we were talking she said it sounded like I had SM as a child. It makes sense - I looked over the diagnostic criteria and that was definitely what was happening when I was around eight years old. Plus, I had anxiety disorders for the years after (went to therapy and sorted them out thankfully \ud83d\ude4f).\n\nI was wondering what actually causes selective mutism. What is the journey like?

I have not been to therapy for a few months because I was not talking so my dad just stopped taking me. Now probably is not the best time to go so i am waiting for coronavirus to go away some. My dad was always in the room with me during therapy which makes it harder for me to talk. Outside of therapy he is one of the only people I talk to but when he is in the room it is even harder for me to talk to others.\n\nI have just gotten so much worse throughout the years and selective mutism is making it worse because I cannot get any of it out. My anxiety has gotten so much worse, no amount of medication has helped. I have also started to develop anger issues. I cannot enjoy anything in life, it feels like i am not really here. Nothing feels real. I do not enjoy anything Why was he in the room with you? Can you write your therapist letters rather than talk? most of my therapists think it makes me less anxious, which it does, but it makes no progress. i have only had 2 therapists before that would not have my dad in the room and the one guy locked me in there and stared at me till i talked at the other also made me uncomfortable. i have had some strange therapists lol sometimes but even that is hard for me to do Idk, I do not think your dad should be there! Llike, maybe the first few sessions until you feel comfortable? But sessions should be confidential. I do not have SM, but I have found it helps to write down my thoughts at home and read them/show my therapist later on. Can you make a video of yourself, like a vlog journal, while you are alone? Or perhaps you just need to ask your father if he would keep your sessions private between you and your therapist. I feel this so hard right now \nI really think that the only way I could have fixed this issue in my own life is i would need to tell my dad \nLike you can tell the therapist but unless you communicate to your dad that \"you would just like to do it alone\" and that should be all you have to say repeat yourself if you have too, then he may not give up If you can what about assistive technology like simple laptops, cells phones, and other digital technologies? \n\nYou can also work on a written letter and present it next time you go to the therapy rather than writing at the time of the appointment? I am thinking an anxiolytic or tranquilizer, and maybe a written note to Dad at least hinting that he might be impeding the therapeutic alliance. Talking and writing was really hard for me so my therapist used to have me pick out songs that I felt could express what I was feeling/experiencing throughout the week. \n\nWe would then listen to the songs together during the next session as a way to communicate without the pressure of actually talking. It sounds like your symptoms are getting worse, so I would strongly urge you to work on a solution. Do not let yourself fall into a rut. Many Redditors have been there and will be there again, because you cannot just fix it once. It is an ongoing process!\n\nMy only tested method has been to imagine that I am someone else. It does not always work, it is not super effective, but it is easy and harmless to try. I would suggest trying it first and having a better method as a backup. Why not the more assuring method first?

I have a card that I made for occasions when someone greets me and then goes beyond that and asks my name or something. It basically explains that sometimes I have trouble speaking and that I do not mean to be rude. It has generally gone over very well and people usually thank me for them. They just want to be kind, you just want to be kind, do not let SM stand in the way of that! If they respond negatively then what have you lost really? Nothing but an awkward wave that you have already noticed they do not really seem to want to give back.", "I have not spoke a word to some of my family So ever since I can remember, I have never spoke to some of my family members. Not a word. I will speak to my mom and grandmother and some of my cousins, but for some reason I cannot speak to my aunts or uncles and some other family members. And I do not just mean like, I do not get along with them or we have nothing in common or they are mean to me so I do not speak to them; infact I wish I could speak to them, theyre very nice and funny and there is literally no reason for me to not want to talk to them. I also feel really guilty for not being able to speak to them cause I know it makes them feel bad, but I cannot help it. Whenever they try talking to me I just look at them and smile and hope they will stop trying to get me to talk. The most I will do is  laugh or say things like \"mhm\" like a toddler that is just learning to speak. Which I know sounds silly that I cannot speak to my family, but that is why I am here, because I need help. This is getting ridiculous now, I am pretty much an adult so I should be able to talk to them.\n\nAnyways plz help idk what to do or how to break out of this I can relate, I have 5 siblings but I can only talk normally to one of them, as well as my mum. It sucks. It is weird though right? Like I feel like a freak not being able to talk to my family members Do not feel too bad. I am 22 and I have had the same problems. You are certainly not alone. I have never spoken a word to any of my grandparents and they have all passed now. Its hard for sure. And I feel a lot of guilt for never speaking to them while they were alive. But you cant beat yourself up about that stuff too much. You can only do your best and if you are like me and worry that the family you still have thinks of you differently because you cannot talk to them, try and get family who understands your situation to explain it. I have several aunts and uncles who I have never spoken too, but I am lucky enough have cousins that understand and that I can talk too. Its a very difficult situation but just remind yourself you can only do your best. \n\nAlso if you have not yet, therapy can be very helpful. If for nothing else, you have someone who can legitimize the situation and people will take that more seriously. Saaameee im 22 wbu? I am 18 I thought I was a complete weirdo for not being able to talk to family members until today when I found out about selective mutism. So that helps knowing it is a disorder and that I can get help for it.\n\nBut im seeing my family now and I really want to talk to them, do you have any recommendations on how to get the courage to do so? I cannot speak to how to really communicate. Believe it or not the only person I was able to overcome my mutism with was my hairdresser lol. My therapist talked a lot about feeling comfortable speaking, and it always seemed like a very daunting task to me. What I got out of my appointments were more about how to be okay with having it rather than \"beating it\". Im absolutely not saying its cant be done and I often think about the future and if I will be better then. All I can really say is find ways to communicate that make you comfortable. I have people I have never spoken to but am more comfortable texting them in small texts. Work your way up if that makes it easier. You do not have to climb the whole mountain today. Just take it a step at a time. Now that you know about selective mutism you can begin learning about it and hearing others experiences. The day I learned about SM was the start of a lot of improvements. I do that, smile until the person figures that I do not want to speak. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 it feels really rude sometimes, but at the same time im like, you know I am not going to talk to you so why even try? Exactly, but it is a natural instinct to get someone to talk so I do not blame them True, but i feel so awkward when i cannot seem to say anything have you considered a professional that has experience in selective mutism? SAME I just found out about it yesterday, so since yesterday yes. But as if right now I am stuck at my grandmothers for a  few days and one of my aunts that I go mute around is also here. I used to be able to talk to people really all t, but I developed sm around strangers and extended family as a child, and recently I have started having issues talking to friends and close family. idk how to fix it but I just want say it really sucks, I am sorry anyone has to go through this and I wish you well in finding a solution. I know I have heard of adults overcoming mutism before, so it is certainly possible See the funny thing with me is outside of family gatherings, im actually really loud and social. I have the same issue as you; I am 18 and have selective mutism. I am unable to talk to all of my grandparents and some extended family (like aunts, uncles, cousins). It just feels so hopeless, I wish that it had never started in the first place. I used to have it at school too up until grade four when I moved schools. Now I comfortably talk with everyone (though I still get a bit of anxiety), and I am in university. But I honestly do not know if I will be able to speak to them before they pass; it seems impossible. I feel embarrassed and shameful to ask for help with it. Especially with my family knowing. Me too! I started avoiding family gatherings because it is so awkward and embarrassing to be there and say nothing. Especially if there are new people there who do not know about my disorder, and also when my family members keep asking me questions in front of people. I wish that they would just stop, it would make things a lot easier.", "Is this selective mutism or something different ? I really cannot tell so I guess this is the best place to ask ! So I never had selective mutism as far as I remember but I noticed something a little similar to it recently, I have no idea if this count as selective mutism or if it is some other thing and I cannot find anything on the internet.\n\n\nSo my mother have mental issue that cause her to act kind of abusive toward me, we argued a lot the last 4 years (I cannot remember about before but she was more arguing with my father while I was doing my own things). Usually I used to have panic attacks and cry when we argued but recently I just freeze and stop talking, yersteday it happened just because she made a remark about some things (I think it was about housework like usually but I cannot remember), we did not even argue. \n\nThe issue is that even when I calm down a little and can do stuff like usually it is like I have forgotten how to speak, not only to my mother but I cannot even speak to my cat (I can whisper though) nor my friends (we do vocal chats on discord everyday). \nIt feels like I do not even want to speak honestly, but even if I try to I can just make some weird noises.\n\n\nI remember one time 4 years ago when I saw a movie about a girl who had selective mutism I was like \"Oh maybe if I stopped talking too it would rearrange things !\" because I always go and talk to my mother even if I know I will get hurt because she just will not understand and maybe not even listen (I have no idea why I do this) and tried to only communicate by writing but I could not bring myself to stop talking for more than two days and I started talking a lot again.\n\n I am not sure why I am mentioning that but yeah I feel way more safe when I do not talk to her and maybe not being able to speak is the only way for me to do that but I have no idea about why I cannot talk to my friends because they are super nice.\n\n\nNow my mother's gone to walk our dog and I tried to speak to myself but even if I can do it I feel like I am running out of air and I have to really force my voice and I sound very weird. The other times I could only speak after saying something by accident/reflex)\n\nSo yeah it probably would not help but I would still like to kwow if this is selective mutism to a smaller extent than most people or if it is something else ? Hello, you appear to have asked a question about whether you have selective mutism. \n\nWe can help you understand selective mutism with ( Please remember that our members can only give you an opinion on whether you meet the criteria for selective mutism, not a diagnosis. If you would like to be properly assessed, it is highly recommended to see a medical professional. ( section of the wiki.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/selectivemutism) if you have any questions or concerns.* Oh I see, thanks for the explanation ! That is very possible since I was already dissociating for this reason. I would like to see a therapist when I will move out, for now I use things like chamomille for my anxiety and try to distract myself as much as I can. My mother called a woman who works with families to help them with their issues (I am not sure how it is called in english) and she was very nice so maybe she would be able to help !\n\nThanks, hopefully it will get better !", "SM - Current life.  Just an post.\n\nI am nearly 17 y/o (specifically male), got diagnosed with SM when I was 16 (I have no idea why I have not gotten diagnosed earlier) and on top of that I have an speech impediment. I dropped out of high school after a few weeks since I did not feel I could handle with being there at all of reasons I myself cannot explain clearly and I do not like being surrounded by lots of people however after having tons of meeting with school staff and other people (sometimes I did not even show of up because I could not and did not want to so my mom went alone and just told me what they talked about after but the times I did go there, I was told I only needed to either nod by doing the gestures of yes, no, \"do not know\", sometimes I verbally say out the words, yes, no, maybe, do not know. but that is it since it is impossible for me to say \"long\" sentences unless I speak alone at home with family like, mom, brother, but I stutter more than normally and cannot even express my thoughts clearly and I usually cannot remember what I want to say and sometimes I cannot even say the word I meant since I cannot remember it even if I know what the word is.\n\nAfter a few weeks of discussions they sent me to a small \"school\" which had around 8-12 people +including staff. It is okay being there but they only have a few substances so it is not really a \"real\" high school and I only need to speak a few times but it causes me feeling \"nervous, scared, panic etc..\" and I have a huge relief in my mind, stomach, body after my speech have ended and do not need to speak again for the rest of the day (Not sure if it is a bad thing) and the words I use to talk may sound improperly in grammar wise and since I have speech impediment I choose my words carefully but it is hard and just sounds wrong either way and i am clueless what will happen later since I cannot stay here forever and finish my high school degree so they will most likely send me to a \"real\" high school later but how? I would do the same thing as before, drop out again but this time I will not even go there since they have no solutions for my problems (the only thing that I can think of if they have a special kind of teacher that is specialized in people with speech disorders and such and will assist me through high school and be there for me til I graduate, however I have no idea if it is possible even if it stated in the law here that the school need to do whatever they can to help me to graduate and I do not even like being with other people after grown accustomed to loneliness for years.\n\nEven in middle school the only way I graduated there to pass qualifications for high school was that I went there 1-2 hours everyday being alone in a room and study and did tests (I never talked with the teachers). I quit being in the classroom when the 8th grade started and never went to school until 9th grade to pass the substances I needed so I have not talked to my 2 friends for nearly 2-3 years now but I have them on snapchat.\n\nI cannot speak with strangers, teachers, students, family relatives like cousins and such. I often do gestures even at my speech therapist or use my daily words like, yes, no, maybe, do not know, but I often say yes even if I want to say no and sometimes I use maybe/do not know instead for saying yes/no\n\nI feel unmotived to do anything in life and I have no joy in almost anything I do. The only thing I feel now is to be left alone in my room forever but that is impossible.\n\nI avoid anything that expects me to talk. I avoid making eye contact with every person even if it is my family. The only times I can genuinely smile and laugh is when i am alone. My facial expression stays the same almost 24/7 even if I do think something is funny I do not laugh, sometimes I get an uncontrollable smile but it only last for 1-2 secs until it go back to normal.\n\nMy voice have different tones sometimes and at unexpected/surprised times when there is a situation where I need to talk i am terror-strucked instantly and have hundreds of thoughts simultaneously on how to avoid to talk or how to say the shortest sentence possible like if a stranger suddenly confront me and ask me something.\n\nAt home I happen to be more be angry, irritable, frustrated and I need to be informed at anything that can involve me in some way.\n\nI had Trichotillomania for a long period of time (hair pulling) but I got over it since I did not want to have a bold spot at my head since it can attract people attentions and I actually liked the feeling when you pull out the hair sometimes I took a handful and just pull them out the hardest I could do and the white thing at the root of the hair I ate them aswell.\n\nI have not seen my speech therapist for a few months now but they said that I would be talking to her again in like a few weeks but I only feel like it is hopeless but at the same time I feel, I do not know maybe appreciated?\n\nI feel like even if I get intense treatment it will not help me, medications? what kind of medications? does it even have a affect on me? I do not know.\n\nMy only interests are calligraphy (I want to learn it but it is takes long practice and work, besides i am a left writer so it takes more work) I have an interest in learning chinese but that takes patience and hard practice for 2.5-5 learns to master it to some degree. I like poker but that takes practice aswell, intense studying to be good at it and ofcourse money. You could practically say i am talentless at everything.\n\nThat is it, i am sure I can write alot more but this text took me 3.5 hours to get it *done.*  SM is an anxiety disorder, so if you are not already seeing a therapist that is knowledgable about anxiety disorders and their treatment it might be something to discuss with your parents. I cannot tell you whether it is true or not that intense treatment will be unhelpful, but I can tell you I felt the same way before going to residential treatment. \n\nI felt that no one was like me, that somehow I was going to be immune to anxiety treatment. That I was more broken than everyone else. Now I have seen dozens of people who felt the same way learn to manage their OCD and other anxiety disorders, so now I know that is not true. I was never broken, I just never had the tools to treat my social anxiety and selective mutism on my own. All the work is on you in a treatment setting (with support of course), so you get out as much as you put in.\n\nTreatment aside, I know how shitty and isolating selective mutism is. It sucks when no one in your life knows how to help you. I hope things get better for you.", "Selective utism at 32. This is my first post on the wider webs. \nI learned about selective mutism in 2014 and have been working to speak to all people and in all situations ever since. It has cost me jobs because they think I am being insubordinate for having trouble speaking or mute. \nThere were a lot of traumatic things that happened in high school and afterwards that made me confused what is tied to my rape and what is tied to not speaking and letting others speak for me. \n\nI have a good church that mostly understands, but in Alabama, I have be keep explaining it to people and try to get people to believe me, even when they cannot see it. \n\nI have trouble when I do not speak to someone or let them speak for me, and then eventually start speaking for myself. It seems to upset people because they do not understand that I could not speak to them before that. And they think I was making it all up. \n\nExposure therapy and lots of EMDR is what allowed me to make a lot of progress. \n\nAnd this is the next step. Opening up to the World Wide Web that is not Facebook. \n\nBe gentle, I was really close to quitting on life a couple of weeks ago because of this.  I had selective mutism as a young grade school kid...and have spent many of the proceeding years being \"very quiet and shy\". I can relate to where you are coming from. It can be so difficult managing life with being anxious and afraid to communicate! I am glad to hear you have been working on ways to reach our more... that is great! SM can sometimes be a hard concept for people to understand when you try to explain it...even within the safe boundaries of anxiety related topics, there are still some who just do not get it. SM was not even a \"thing\" when I started school...and only in the past few years was able to put a real name to it. It amazed me there were other people who experienced this, too. Give yourself a big pat on the back for trying new things! Thank you.  Since you are having trouble with people not understanding, have you thought of joining an anxiety support group? The people in the support group will certainly understand you better than the general public. You could maybe bring a whiteboard to communicate.\n\nI started speaking outside of home when I was 16, and even now with many years of \"experience\" talking in public, I have much trouble. I have not yet lost any jobs over it, but I believe I have missed out on opportunities because I come across as awkward and rude. I am not able to keep a conversation going the way almost everybody else seems to be able to. I could understand how a person might feel uncomfortable because you have trouble talking, but if they are abrasive it might be best to avoid contact with them if possible.\n\nI agree with RamblingRoses that your ability to go out into social situations and face adversity shows that you are resilient. Do not forget to give yourself credit for it. Thanks.\nI will try again to join an anxiety support group. Right now I have a meditation group that I go to and helps a lot. \nI just spent a lot of time avoiding interactions with peers because I felt a lot of shame, but now that is been coming to an end and I am starting to have more peer friendships.  Hello from Tuscaloosa.  I am here for my daughter.  She is 9 years old and is still struggling with SM.  We have just recently got help from brave bunch in Miami.  It was the best decision of our lives.  She still only speaks to family, but spoke to 6 counselors and all the kids at brave bunch.  The exposure and other techniques they use were amazing.\n\nIt is sad that it is so hard to get SM help here in this state.  The University of Alabama's psychology department has helped a lot, but they were not trained to deal with this sort of thing.   Hopefully you are staying around supportive friends and family though! Yep, I am staying with my parents and I am finding more and more understanding friends. \n\nIt is good you found some support with the University in Tuscaloosa, I might see what I can find at the University in Birmingham. \n\nHope she continues to make improvements. ", "i applied for a job for the first time I am so scared that I will not be considered. When I was looking at jobs I saw how many employers wanted people with good communication skills. And I have not spoken in 2 months.", "Child diagnosed My daughter (7) was diagnosed last year with selective mutism. \nWe have since had her followed by the schools social worker (who said she was just shy and would outgrow it ..) and now she sees a psychotherapist. \n\nShe is the loudest one in the house until anyone else walks in the door or we go out anywhere. Then she can only whisper, which is something at least so we encourage that. But we are worried about her making and keeping friends, doing school group assignments and presentations, and just expressing herself like we know she wants to. \n\nHer grandfather is hard of hearing and gets noticeably frustrated when she whispers and he cannot hear her. This has led to her being afraid of him and talking to him less which is totally understandable and we have tried explaining this to him. \n\nWhat are things we as parents can do to help her? What are things that would help a younger you? What can we suggest to her teachers, grandparents, or even friends? I am writing something, I should comment it later. Yep, my extended family pretty much does not get it until this day. Besides my one Aunt/Uncle who idk if their son (my cousin) had SM or not...but he was deemed 'the one who do not talk' by my family. I grew up with SM (and still have it at 18), but it resonates most in my family, although talking to strangers is still odd/nerve racking, I have yet to do any sort of presentation in class (which I will in college), so that is either going to go great or go horribly wrong...we will see. If I remember, I will post about the result of that on here someday in the future.\n\nHow I always went about writing papers or doing projects, is just act like your putting on a character when you are writing, that made it a lot more tangible in my head. I actually wrote a poem about my mom in 3rd, 4th, or 5th grade....and I am just being honest, that poem was just me forcing through, it was not that genuine. Which is sad, but yeah.\n\nMy Grandpa has always though I am playing a game, but I think as time went on he either gave up on that, or came slightly more around. He is actually said to me like he does not know how I am going to handle myself later on and such. I believe I will be able to manage. My cousin or the son from earlier, I mentioned in my eyes ever really recovered. He is very awkward in conversation and does not conversate normally. He is 30, and has not had a job...he is on disability now for a 'back injury,' we do not know if that is truly the sole reason or what. That family has always looked out for him, but I think they have looked out for him too intensely.\n\nI think the best thing is for teachers, family, and friends to treat you more normally. Have no expectation for them to talk, but if they do talk, make NO BIG DEAL about it. The thing with my teachers in school knowing I was SM, I never talked to them because I thought if I did talk...now they are going to think nothing is wrong with me. I did talk in Elementary school before any stigma was there, occasionally because as a kid it was more I did not see sense in speaking more than necessary....though I managed to make friends somehow, I think establishing some sort of friendships in Elementary school can be important, as that kind of helped me form them through middle and highschool.\n\n6th grade was the worst year for me, I shut down entirely when it came to school, the only person I could consistently talk to rather normally is the Nurse (I have never been a small talker though, and still am not). Xbox was also the best talking area for me. The only other time I talked in school in 6th grade was occasionally to other students, but never in the presence of the entire class....BESIDES 7th grade health class, why? The teacher was old and known to be nasty, I heavily doubted she cared/knew I was SM, so I just spoke during a skit....although no one recalls that, I told my mom a few years later.\n\nAnother thing was throughout this time I never really discussed my SM with my parents (though during this same time communicating with my parents became abnormal)...and really through my entire life I have NEVER had anyone I have been entirely open with. Maybe....my one friend in HS, but he kind of split connection with me by 11th grade....I talked a lot of topics to him.\n\nI actually had a YouTube channel I started, now in my 9th grade class (2016)......in my third friendgroup. My second was in middleschool (7th grade-start of 8th)....so anyway, I did not speak in the first video I made, but I did in the second. Xbox was the key in that, everyone would hear about my channel and would have seen it, it even got played in my 9th grade class, and that was funny. The teacher saw it too. That class was fun.\n\nIt was only about a month ago, late late June 2021 when I actually wanted to change myself and start to speak, although in the late week admittedly, I have definitely dove from that same drive I had the prior week. I think it is good to have self-made goals, and honestly if I was back starting highschool (in my current minsdset), I would either have started talking out of the blue\u2026or I would have asked to be transferred to another highschool by my parents so I could have a blank slate.\n\nNow my SM lies within my Parents, Extended family, Siblings, and Schoolmates (past now)\u2026.strangers are just not-often/awkward, I do not say much more than what is required ever.\n\nXbox was always a place where I spoke a lot, but I never really added to the convo. If my brother was on Xbox, I would not speak to him, just my friends and people from school. I do not play it anymore because it is so boring these days. I also quit that Youtube Channel with my last video ever (unofficially) made in Early June 2021. I want to overcome my SM by 19, and I feel like I am mentally there, I am just not really driven in any particular way to really dive off the cliff when it comes down to it.\n\nI think it could be good to discuss more specifics regarding your SM with a parent (one that can be understanding and willing to help). I would also recommend watching \u2018Jessica Spears\u2019 on YouTube\u2026while it does not describe me exactly, a lot of it hits home. Also within this last month, I started looking at this subreddit, and I started watching these videos\u2026.the Discord associated with this sub is not that helpful to me personally, but you can check it out. I also would not say I am mentally ok at this point, not that I am suicidal but I am definitely not too cheery these days. And when I am happy, it is SO MUCH, it is actually crazy how polar opposite it can feel\u2026my normal mood vs my happy mood.\n\nI tend to think treating someone like they can more so talk normally is probably most crucial, that is something I need to run by my Mom (as I tell her a few things, in somewhat sentences). Although I do not always want to do it, I push through. When you lean in, or assume what I am saying, idk just to me treat us like we talk normally, with the mindset that we may still not talk. Idk? That could depend, but for me that is something.\n\nThere is a lot I want out of life, a relationship, possibly a family (idk), I want to do more things on my own. And as much as I want all that, I equally never want to change\u2026though, I want what comes with the change, if that makes sense. I have heard once you beat it, you realize it was a false blanket of security, but it is very difficult to now. It is also as much as I want to be expressive and join the conversation, I equally do not want to participate or interject. You tend to feel like what you say is less-important, and in a way speaking, you are kind of \u2018going out-of-line,\u2019 of people\u2019s perceived perception of you. So as much as you want to be yourself, you fear being viewed as someone else. I wish I just wrote all my issues, concerns, wishes, and truths down and gave them to my Mom, my Dad, my Siblings\u2026but I cannot. In my own personality I am very honest, but it is hard to be honest to myself (I guess?).\n\nAnyway, there is always more to think about and discuss, but that is what I have thought of for now. Also I do keep a journal of my Day to Day, which is pretty detailed. Since Nov of 2020, though lately as my motivation has dipped, I am 5 days behind\u2026.It helps to keep things going, idk. It is ice to reflect. I also have video from 2011, and I spoke openly with my Brother (although still back then, I kept my words to a minimum even with family still)\u2026.I was never one to express my own thoughts too well, still am not. That stopped in about 2012-2013\u2026.and I have been pretty much the same since. The same way I was when I was 10, is how I am at 18. Back in 2015, I was helping my dad decide if he should buy his old car back, or buy a new one. I did not talk then. He has that new car now, and that old car as well now\u2026I still am the same. That was a 5 year spread of time. I will end there, but good luck and always be supporting in help with this.\n\nEdit: That is long lol the other comment mentions it, but really just being treated normally helps boost self-esteem and confidence tremendously. i grew up being an outcast and was treated like i did not exist bc i never spoke and it really hurt. the teachers knew not to call on me during class but that quickly turned into just ignoring the fact i was there. let teachers know that although they should not force her to participate in speeches/presentations in front of the class but maybe instead let her say the speech privately to the teacher and maybe eventually in front of a small group of friends or peers.\n\npatience really is the key with sm and forcing things will only make it worse. do help her out of her comfort zone every once in a while but make sure she has time to prepare herself for it and praise her for the effort she makes, and have the teachers praise her as well\n\nik it helps some people to have a comfort item on hand to make them feel safe and that item could really be anything. since shes young, maybe gift her with something and tell her a story about how it is \"magical\" or whatever and that it will protect her and help her.\n\nidk, i am just spitballin but i hope this helps As a parent of two kids with SM, I really recommend the book \"overcoming selective mutism\" by Kotriba and Saffer. it is basically a guide book for parents. I am so sorry you are going through this. I am a parent, too, and the thought that my kids might inherit my SM depresses me. I do have some hope for you, though. I had SM until I was around 10 years old, but even then, if I had to talk in class, or to classmates, or even to my extended family, I would have anxiety attacks. Full on crying in school, at family gatherings. My parents said I was the loudest one at home, too. My issues stemmed from EXTREME social anxiety - I was never diagnosed (this was in the 80\u2019s), but it is very clear to me now that this is what my issue was. I was scared that my voice sounded weird, or what I was saying would sound dumb, or people would judge me somehow. Basically, I cared way too much about what other people supposedly thought. This plagued me until I was about 24, and something just clicked in my brain, and it was as if I outgrew it, or my brain finally matured. I have a successful career now that involves plenty of verbal communication and I do just fine. No one would label me as \u201cshy.\u201d \n\nTry not to call her \u201cshy\u201d disparagingly. This was a mistake my parents made - they would tell people I was \u201cshy\u201d with a disapproving tone, which only made my anxiety even worse, as a child with irrational thoughts who sought out approval. If my parents did not approve of me, then who would? Also, my parents pushed me into social situations which certainly made my self-esteem even worse (I suffered from extremely low self esteem until the magical age of 24). I was always made to feel like there was something \u201cwrong\u201d with me, and to a child like that, being \u201cwrong\u201d is the worst possible thing. \n\nLooking back, I really wish I had been taught how to recognize and manage my anxiety. Anxiety was the root of all of it. Good luck. honestly, there is three big things that would have made my childhood 100x better: humanization, alternative communication, and accommodations.\n\nfor humanization, try to remind her that she is more than her mutism. when i was a kid,  my value was often equated with my words, and i do not wish that on anyone. it also helps if her personality does not develop entirely around her mutism, since when the sm gets better it is often somewhat of an identity crisis lol (who am i if i am not the quiet kid etc etc).\n\nalternative communication wise, i know that it can seem like avoidance, but always give her a backup way to communicate. for me, using sign language helped to phase me into talking once i was finally allowed to learn - if i would already spoken to someone in asl, it would be easier to talk to them vocally. \n\nlastly, accommodations are key, and make sure to follow through with them. threaten the school if you have to - hiring an ed advocate is what finally worked for my case. teachers are going to try to \u2018fix\u2019 your daughter and force her to talk. make sure that everyone your daughter interacts with regularly is educated on sm if at all possible.\n\ni know that selective mutism can seem like a life sentence, but your daughter will get better with time and therapy. when i was twelve it took me weeks to build up to ordering pizza, now i can order my own coffee daily without issue. you are already doing the right thing by coming here and asking us, and i know that all of us here will be available if you ever have further questions. you two are going to get through this &lt;3  Thank you for your reply. I love the idea of a magical gift. Thank you for your response! I never really thought that letting people know about her SM would be a negative thing\u2026 Thank you ! We are working with the psychotherapist for anxiety management an show to deal with it. Thank you for your suggestions. This was very helpful. I am glad I found this sub! Thank you! Looking it up right now ! If your daughter will be/is in public school, putting her under the 504 plan allows dialogue between the family and school to come up with appropriate accommodations for assignments and ensures that teachers are understanding. Mine also came with weekly meetings with the school counselor to touch base and be a resource if needed. \n\nI personally found that having a safe space with my mom was most helpful on a day-to-day level. Even now, I can talk to her about anything and everything fully knowing that I will be heard and that she will respond with respect for me. Unfortunately that means she has stuck with me and always walked me through it, whether it is just trivial thoughts or my darkest days, and I know it was never easy for her. Just knowing there is someone you can freely open up with helps with communication about/ processing issues, providing reassurance, and catching negative emotions or thoughts before things spiral. \n\nPatience is key! (Also therapy!) First of all, I want to say that you have already taken the most important step by allowing your daughter to see a psychotherapist. My selective mutism and social anxiety did not dictate my life because my parents sought out help for me. Sadly so many children are not afforded this. \n\n\nI was diagnosed when I was 4 as I would not talk in school. I too began seeing a counselor and by the time I entered grade 1 I was able to speak in school. I was still painfully shy, so I developed social anxiety that came to a head when I was 16 and sought out counseling once more. I am now 29 and although I am not a social butterfly, I am very happy with where my life has taken me.\n\nIf I could change anything, I would have wanted to have been able to continue to see the counselor even after I began speaking in school. Yes, I was able to speak in school, but I spent 12 years avoiding my peers and panicking when I was called upon by teachers. \n\nAs to what you can suggest to teachers, family, friends, etc. I would educate them on what selective mutism is and reassure them that your child is not simply being defiant. I would also encourage them to treat her just as they would any other child. I often felt like a zoo animal being observed when I interacted with friends and that is just not a great feeling lol \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBut honestly, take a deep breath and try not to worry too much about the future. She clearly has amazing parents who are attentive and supportive. Continue to encourage the whispering and trust that with her wonderful support system that she will progress at her own pace :) I had SM when I was little (4-10) and these are just some of my thoughts:\n\n-\tGive her a small white board to carry around so she can communicate. This gets her comfortable communicating with all sorts of people. Forcing her to only communicate by talking will just put more pressure on her and isolate her. Get her teachers and classmates on board with her writing down her answers. (Bonus points decorate the white board with stickers and make it all special)\n-\tAdding onto the last point, try to lessen the amount of times you speak for her. Encourage her to communicate for herself with the white board to establish confidence! If it takes her a while to write/draw be patient and supportive!\n-\tSet up play dates (especially outside of school and just the two of them) to help her establish at least one good friend in her class. She might eventually start talking to that friend. \n-\tEveryone is different but social workers and speech therapists did not help me at all. Being in an isolated room with an adult stranger was the most scariest thing ever. Made me not want to talk at all.\n-\tTreat her normally when she does talk. Making it out to be some spectacle mounts the pressure on the act which might deter her from talking again. When I was little, whenever I felt \u201cready\u201d to finally talk at school, the feeling of everyone staring me down prevented me from talking. \n-\tAlso I hated when other kids kept asking me why I do not talk like there was something wrong with me. As well as the kids who would say I was faking it \u2014 just made me not want to talk to prove it was real to them\n-\tYounger kids are definitely more nicer, more understanding, and willing to play with kids with SM. Perfect time to encourage her to talk (but not pressure her). Not to scare you but older kids do start to form their own cliques and are more judgemental.\n-\tI felt more comfortable verbally answering objective questions (what is the colour of the sky? Where is the park?) than personal questions (what is your favourite tv show? What did you do on the weekend?). I guess my subconscious rationale was that I cannot get in trouble for saying objective truths lol\n-\tKids can feel your subconsciousness. I knew what the social workers and speech therapists were trying to do (made me feel like something was wrong with me) and I knew my mom was worried and disappointed with me. Even though none of them out right said it. This added to the pressure and fear.\n-\tSome teachers forced me to talk (by outcasting me and taking away privileges) which made me cry and not talk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Educate teachers that forcing it usually has the opposite effect.\n\nFrom 10-13 was an awkward adjustment phase for me talking. But by high school I was fully talking. I even became president of a few high school clubs and was really into leadership stuff. \n\nDo not worry too much about the future, just be present with her and help her along. \n\nTo end this with speculation, unlike kids these days, we did not have social media when I was a kid, but I wonder if chatting online with classmates could help her practise socializing? Thank you for your response. I am putting together a package for the teacher this year explaining sm and meeting them before hand to figure out some ways that her sm can be accommodated (re: class presentations). I am so sorry that people went that way to try to force you into talking. I can only imagine that worsening it. I am afraid of older kids, some are starting to question her (why are not you talking?/ why are you whispering?) and she hates that too. \nThank you for your white board suggestion.", "I am barely in my friend group I can barely talk to my friends ever. There are times when they leave me and go somewhere else and said they just did not notice I was not with them. The company of my friends is bittersweet. I like being near them, but it hurts seeing them converse and laugh with each other. I have no clue how you can just be that social. How do I become comfortable talking to my friends?", "So is everyone here better at talking to strangers? Because that is not something I have experienced.  A lot of what I read on this sub hits home, except for this.  Among strangers, I can only really talk to people who are clearly insecure, or those who are aloof.\n\nI am the least talkative person I know, and I am trying to figure out the cause behind it.  For a long time I thought it was just ASD, and that still might be the case.  I recently learned more about ADHD, and thought maybe that is it.  I have always been a big day dreamer and could never pay attention in class.  I exhibit traits of both, but I have a great memory (anti-ADHD) and can read people pretty well if I am paying attention (anti-ASD).\n\nI am not sure if my mutism is caused by ASD making me nonverbal, or ADHD creating a bunch of white noise that makes it hard for me to tune in, or selective mutism, or just social anxiety.  Throughout my whole life people would tell me to talk more and I am like, \"...I cannot!  I have nothing to say.\"  I do better in 1 on 1 forced convos than in large groups.\n\nI still need to find a therapist (maybe ADHD is making me procrastinate).  But I also actually have a pretty good life.  It is like I have a great fear of failure and that fear helps me to get off my ass and do what I need to get by in life, at the last minute.\n\nSomething else--a few drinks seems to cure my inattentiveness and social anxiety.  Has anyone here had their SM improved by alcohol?\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rambling, just had to get it out there. What you described sounds exactly like me that its a bit scary lol if you would like to talk about it my messages are open I make up a lot of the more recent posts on the sub, I do not have too many issues when talking to strangers, but it does make me nervous admittedly. If I am honest I think my SM tends to somewhat affect talking to strangers in very new environments that already make me nervous....although maybe that is more regular social anxiety, idk? In those situations I can talk, although I have yet to be a small talker either.\n\nMy direct family is hardest for me which tends to be the minority with SM though I think people do suffer it alongside me. I can talk to them in small sentences and yes/no, but I do not make conversation, jokes extremely rarely, and small talk is non-apparent.\n\nEdit: Although others do find it easier to talk to those that do not know they do not talk. I am with you on the direct family thing too. As I got older, I cannot really converse with them anymore.", "Does anyone else hold grudges from your childhood? Hey all, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a recovering Selective Mute. I am also an editor for a mental health blog. I was editing a story last week from a girl recounting her SM experience. I felt so much pain for the writer. It was obvious that she held so much resentment to her family for the way she was treated during her childhood. I really wanted to reach out to her, but my senior editor did not think it was a good idea as she is working through it in her own way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking today, I remember feeling the same way she did a few years ago. I was so angry that my mum would ask me why I was not a normal child. I was so traumatised by my nan trying to make me talk in front of family that I could not talk to. I was so disappointed in my mum when she never stood up for me. I was so annoyed that my dad always said he knew how I felt because he was shy. I AM NOT SHY, I felt like screaming. I felt like no one understood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I think back now, I can see their points of view. It was not just me suffering, it was everyone around me. That may be because I am in my twenties now but I find it very upsetting that someone else is having those awful feelings like I once did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else hold or have held grudges or felt betrayed by your family or friends? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that you can all find peace in your memories as I have. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I felt that way too. I felt like no one understood what I was going through and triggered many mental problems to occur that I am still working at today. And I  would really get frustrated at my friends when they just would not understand that I cant talk in front of everyone, especially during ice breakers with a lot of people  that required yelling across a circle to be heard by everyone. However, I also hold grudges against myslef due to how many things I missed out on because of SM. I missed out on so many amazing friendships, dance opportunities, and potential jobs, all because I could not talk very well. \n\n(Done on mobile and at 1am, sorry about any mistakes) That is interesting, I did not really think about holding resentment towards myself. I hope that you realise that none of it is your fault. I believe that you only miss out on opportunities that you are meant to miss out on. Like yourself, I think my other mental health issues came off the back of SM (Anxiety and Depression). I think a lot of people with SM have anxiety so even if they recover from SM (like myself), they are never truly free from the clutches. \n\nThanks for sharing :)  I had it as a child and I felt angry at a bunch of people back then, especially at the teachers I had growing up. Now I do not hold any resentment towards anyone. I understand that dealing with a child with SM must have been incredibly challenging and although they did not handle it well, I am sure they all tried the best they could.  Yes, definitely.\n\nI was a victim (and witness) of frequent verbal abuse throughout my childhood. I believe this is what silenced me. I developed a fear of becoming a target for being heard. If I kept quiet, my abusers would not notice me. Realizing this now, I was able to break through the silence, step by step. You cannot change the past but you can change your attitude towards it.", "practicing asl :) i have selective mutism and i know a little asl. i know that getting treatment for my selective mutism is better, but i literally have so many other issues/diagnoses that I am prioritizing that learning a new language probably is more worth it right now lol.  \n\n\ndoes anyone know any good ways to sign \"selective mute?\" i sign \"sometimes voice off\" when i needed to explain to my friends who know asl (quite a few of them know it). they got the point, but are there better ways i could sign it?? i am in hospitals a lot and i want to be able to get the point across to the interpreter the best way i can in case of something happening. \n\nif i have to explain to someone who does not know asl i usually \"(point at ear) (thumbs up) (point at mouth) 'so-so' \\\" which is usually pretty funny i sign \"i cannot talk\" This is why animals and I get along so well, using other non verbal communications.\n\nI have used \u201csorry\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d automatically when I am too tired to talk, but other than meeting the occasional hard of hearing signer, has never considered using it to talk with normal talky people.\n\nSmart idea! I use Finnish sign language, I usually sign \"today mute\" or \"I no speak\" with people I deal with more often, strangers I might just nod as a hello and sign \"thank you\" unless they specifically ask, then I sign \"mute\" which is easy to understand even if you do not know fsl cause it is two fingers pointing at the mouth from the side, maybe if they start signing back, I might sign \"slow thank you\" cause I am slow to read sl or point at ear and \"good\" or alternatively \"no deaf\". If someone is curious about why I am not talking if they know I can talk, I sign \"s m fear\".

How can i make her my friend? I do not know how to make friends in general and i have social anxiety so this is not the best scenario for a friendship to start with. \n\nWhat are some activities/things that we can do together that do not require verbal communication that we could do? Also how do i approach her in general, I do not want to make her uncomfortable or rush things\n\nThanks for reading and for the incoming (i hope) advice &lt;3 How did it come to the point that shes teaching you to sew? A bit of context might help.\n\nYou probably have an intuitive idea of how to approach her bc you have social anxiety yourself and because youre here in the first place. Just ask her directly if shes comfortable with X if you want to know though, it is varies from person to person. We work in the back of a shop, met through the owner of it and she is much more advanced than me so she teaches me stuff. I was thinking to make a playlist on spotify, where we could share our music so we get to know each other more, since I cannot ask her questions For me, my friends know I am like 'mute' but they do not actually understand it fully. I can talk with them over xbox and they know that, and when we did hang out 2019 and before, I could talk pretty easy with them, although I still was not and am not today....fully expressive with anybody.\n\nMy one friend even ordered my Dr. Pepper for me from Taco Bell once because I just could not get the girl to hear me (she also took $0.25 from me, was not happy about that, but I did not do anything about it).......from then on I have been really not motivated to order food because they can never hear me. It was not anything my friend did, I have great respect for him.\n\nIn middleschool I went with my previous friend group (from the above) to Wendy's every Friday...that is the spot. I did not talk in school, but I could with certain friends....and I even spoke in this english group I had with kids I never really associated with before but my friend was there.....back then SM was less of a hold on me, as it did not really emit a stigma yet (that english group being 8th grade). So back to Wendy's....I ordered my food there and told them to hold the pickles and onions...just cheese....and that was fine, I mean that place is CRAZY crowded. I do not anymore and it is been about (since 7th grade...) so....uh, since more to the start of 2015ish.\n\nIn August I did for a while go to stores to pick up food for my family, and that was fine....but I was motivated to.....and there was pauses where I almost did not say anything and just went along with nodding.....pikcing up food....so yeah, now I lack motive as I just look at normal life as so obscure.....to me it is abnormal.\n\nAlthough when I look at myself from the imagined 3rd person.....it shocks me how I am. It seems stupid. And it is stupid, cause I will eventually die....and have never changed (at least if the present continues as it is).......which I hate because I know we all die, but it is so hard to believe it applies to me......and it just does not help.....\n\nBasically just treat them as your friend but do not expect them to be able to do everything....but do not expect that they cannot or will not at the same time....like just an understanding.\n\nI got messages from my friend, I would read...and ignore....but I always read them. There is more, but idk... I cannot really understand SM because I do not have it and even though i can imagine her discomfort, based on my own experiences, i know it will still remain to me unknown, so I do not have any expectations. Thank you for sharing your story, it helped me understand what she deals with &lt;3 you can defiantly ask her questions! If she is comfortable enough writing to you then you guys can communicate that way! my bf, he now speaks to me but it was almost two years of working on it, used to talk to me through the note app on his phone and that always worked for us! Yeah i meant I cannot expect her to answer verbally, and since we work manually it is difficult to have a written conversation but she definitely writes if needed otherwise i ask her only \u201cyes or no\u201d questions Writing to talk?  Text?    Idk\nSelective mutism does not mean completely mute. means she can warm up and start talking to you eventually I wouldnt give people the impression that SMers warm up to talking. They might get frustrated that shes not talking after becoming friends. Even if the person is very close they might not necessarily talk. I do not expect her to talk, it would be nice because it will mean she is completely comfortable around me, but I would understand if that never happened, and I am fine with that Keep sewing together. This is a fantastic way to bond with someone in a casual way. Maybe offer to bring coffees next time, and just keep asking questions if you have them. Maybe this is just a sewing friend, maybe you will find more interests in common. But this is definitely  a great start! Hi. As someone with sm I would say do not ask her a lot of questions, and if she does not respond just let it go. And if you ask her to be friends, or hang out, it will be the best day of her life.

I am not sure the exact age I was diagnosed with social anxiety but it was anywhere between 9-12. i am almost 20 now and 1000000000% certain positive I was misdiagnosed and actually have selective mutism. I am going to talk to my psychiatrist about this and see if I can have my diagnosis changed. The thing is since symptoms heavily overlap I do not know how to explain the difference between them to my mom or anyone really if anyone can help I am struggling so bad Literally almost my entire life existence has been wasted I am not a professional but I have both of these, with selective mutism being the predominant one until over a year ago, where I recovered and social anxiety took over.\n\nSocial anxiety is:\n- the fear of being judged/evaluated for everything you do, resulting in fear of social events, such as conversations, making phone calls, ordering at the store, etc. In order to avoid embarassment, people with social anxiety may choose not to talk. Before/after a social situation that may seem like nothing to people without social anxiety, we may experience heart rate speeding up, sweaty palms, nausea, panic attacks, etc.\n\nSelective mutism:\n- when put with strangers or people you are not comfortable with, you can not physically talk. Even if you want to, it feels like someone has their hand around your vocal cords physically preventing you from doing so. \n- has all the symptoms of social anxiety and can look like social anxiety but the main difference is just not being able to talk at all, and its not by choice\n\nIf you are completely unable to talk (like, not able to get any words out) to certain people and in certain situations despite needing to and it is really screwing up with your life, it is probably selective mutism. Again, I am not a professional so definitely talk to your psychiatrist if you are worried about it. oh yea i think i have both then wtf Selective mutism is extreme social anxiety.  On a scale of 1-10 for social anxiety, SM is 15.", "Why is not using your voice to interact with other people rude... ...when what is really rude is feeling entitled to the voices produced by *other people's bodies*? \ud83e\udd14 Meant to put \"considered rude\" in the title - but that is probably implied. Too late to change it \ud83d\ude13 I wonder this as well. To me theres no real difference between when somebody waves to me or nods their head versus actually saying \u201chi!\u201d out loud \n\nI learned recently though that other people think you are rude if you dont talk? And apparently the best way to maintain a good relationship is to say their name when saying hi as well. \n\nMakes me feel kind of hopeless Rudeness and manners are just a social tool to allow humans to get along with each other. Different societies have different concepts of what is and is not rude, including around speech. \n\nHowever, just because it is a social construct, does not mean that it is not important. Politeness has a purpose. It stops us from hurting others accidentally. None of us are islands. We are all connected to other people, whether we like it or not. And part of that connection is using the rules of politeness in one's culture to get along with other people. \n\nYes, it sucks when you have SM and cannot fulfil that polite role of using speech to interact with others. But that does not mean that we should blame people or think them entitled. They are influenced by their experiences just as we are. For many people, speech is a soothing interaction, an acknowledgement or a ritual even. To not receive can be upsetting. I am curious, would them just replying \"Hi\" or \"Hey\" back feel rude to you? Because people expect you to talk, that is just how it goes this It is because of they do not know better and is used to the culture they grew up in. It is hard to tell if someone are interested and friendly, in a bad mood or just ignoring you at purpose if they do not respond, some people thinks because of it is the communication they grew up with and were taught. Not everyone knows different disabilities exist because of none taught them it.\n\nNormally I expect some forms of answers because of it is what I am used to. No answers are unexpected because of it is rare. It does not need to be spoken. It can be written, gesture, sign language or similar.", "I am Fed Up With This I am fed up with having selective mutism. My mother calls me an idiot because I cannot talk.

I use my phone as I do not know anyone who knows ASL therefore it would not benefit me without forcing those in my life to learn it. It is just easier to use my phone I think it is alright to use your phone. But whether people are going to get annoyed or be understanding depends on who the people are, so you would know best.

Well, It can be rude sometimes not to talk or socialize, but you may also not feel comfortable to do so.

I would just like to ask if anyone has any experience in effectively communicating to people that you have SM and what their response is like.

Even then though I would have been anxious about it but at least I could get out my thoughts and explain why I am the way I am I typically carry index cards and write on them when I need to communicate at school but when I am out with people and I feel somewhat comfortable with them I type in my notes app as the title so it is bold and they can read it.

How do I begin? Hi everyone. I am turning 28 in a few months, and I have basically given up on society as a selectively mute teenager... until now. I have been going through a brain rewiring experience recently and it is all thanks to music.\n\nI used to feel almost wickedly proud for hiding from people and being immune to loneliness, but now... I am longing to express myself, make friends, and give taking part of society and stepping outside a try. But the problem is that I am afraid and completely clueless on how to start. It feels like my mind has not socially grown past that of a teenager's. I have become an extreme shut-in with absolutely no experience with how society works.\n\nI had plenty of help and opportunities chucked at me as an extremely stubborn teenager, but now as a remorseful adult, I cannot help but feel like a forgotten lost cause of a human being. There is no one around to push me and help me get out of my comfort zone. How I wish to turn back time!\n\nI attempted therapy some years ago, but the therapist was completely heartless. She worked on her computer as I sat there waiting for her to say something. This experience started this forgotten lost cause feeling that I have.\n\nBut now with the thought of playing music, I have gained some newfound courage once more. I am willing to talk and show emotion more than ever now. There are so many things that I want to do (get my GED, meet people, get started on a career, get some health concerns checked out, perhaps join a band), but my uncultured mind and the tightened knots around my mouth seem like so much to try and fix and undo.\n\nHow can I start with life? Any adults with selective mutism that got past this hurdle? How did you guys do it? I have no advice. I am in much the same place as you, and this post is so relatable it almost feels like something I could have written myself. \nBest wishes on your goals and on your recovery. I had a feeling many of us selective mutes were on the same boat. Best wishes to you too! Working in retail helped me a lot because everyday I was forced to talk to customers and coworkers. It was like exposure therapy for me. But it was such a difficult period going from shut in to society and it is social rules. I still struggle sometimes sigh. I feel like a teenager too! And what a horrible therapist smh. Next time do make a complaint and ask if you can switch therapist. If one does not work for you.. another one might. \n\nYou have found your spark which is a great start! I do not have that spark so I am still stuck. Idk much about music but I would start with school. Utilize your school resources and counselor in order to find out what you want to do as a career. Join clubs. School is where you will meet people.\nTry to get internships or a part time job that is related to your field because most jobs want experience. You will be exposed to more people at jobs/internships too which means more opportunities to make friends or acquaintances. Try not to burn bridges with people like I did because they can be a job reference or may even offer you a job. Exchange Instagram, fb etc and stay connected. \n\nMaking friends as adults is soooo difficult. I have never used a friendship app but I have heard people found friends on there. There are Facebook groups for different hobbies so maybe look into local music related groups. Maybe you can find a band to join on there idk? Maybe you can start one? There is the meetup website which I found awkward lol but you may find success on there. If you are comfortable with social media.. you can post your music on tik tok, YouTube, Reddit etc. And I hope you get your health stuff checked out soon cuz health is truly wealth. Learned the hard way.\n\nIt is definitely overwhelming but you are not alone in this fight.. you got this! Start small and keep going at it. Reward yourself at the end of the day/week if you have to. I wish I could help you more but this is all I got. I wish you a lot of luck! \\- It was like exposure therapy for me\n\nIt really does seem like exposure is the way to go.\n\n\\- Next time do make a complaint and ask if you can switch therapist.\n\nYeah, I will most likely seek therapy again and if it does not work out, I will try and look for another one. Sadly, it seems like many people do not know how to deal with selective mutes, especially as adults. Being a mute is seen as cute as a developing kid, but as an adult...\n\n\\- I do not have that spark so I am still stuck.\n\nI got this spark by listening to some music that I have never heard before and something just clicked. I have finally found something that I can connect to artistically. Now I know how people feel when they talk passionately about their favorite artists and form connections with other fans. Perhaps trying something new will help!\n\n\\- Utilize your school resources and counselor in order to find out what you want to do as a career.\n\nBy school you mean college, I assume! I would love to go back to school, mainly for the guiding and counseling, like you said, but admittedly, it is a bit embarrassing to go back to school at almost 28 years old. Everyone is 19 or 20. I wish I can go back in time and tell my teenage self to never drop off out of school (and to pick up the piano). Regardless, I will probably still go.\n\n\\- There are Facebook groups for different hobbies so maybe look into local music related groups.\n\nI am hoping to find some musical buddies naturally as I venture outside, whether it is from school, work, or whatever else.\n\nThis is more than enough help, we have all got our own struggles. Thanks so much for the advice! A hobby is a great way.  If you are interested in something, find a group of people who meets to do it.  You can hang out and fit in without talking as much, and when you are able to talk it will be low pressure and about a subject you already know about. Sounds like a sort of musical club or group. Hopefully I can find something like that. Thanks for the advice! Music is the best for two reasons of the top of my head.  First, it is not even like soccer where you are expected to yell and communicate during the action.  Second, if you are hanging out with musicians and also keeping your mouth shut, you will likely be the least socially awkward person there :) exposure was the way to go for me too. i got a job working alone at an ice cream kiosk a month ago and being forced to speak to all these customers has already done so many wonders for my SM exposure was the way to go for me too. i got a job working alone at an ice cream kiosk a month ago and being forced to speak to all these customers has already done so many wonders for my SM I turn 29 in a couple months, and I am in a similar situation as you, except I feel like I already went past a point of no return.. As my anxiety got lesser, I only found more obstacles that 'normal' people face, in addition to my own. It is discouraging. Seeing a psychiatrist helps a bit, at least regarding momentary comfort. I got lucky, I found someone who was actually willing to help their patients. She says I will be able to change, as I did over the past several decades. I am not sure though. &gt;I attempted therapy some years ago, but the therapist was completely heartless. She worked on her computer as I sat there waiting for her to say something. This experience started this forgotten lost cause feeling that I have.\n\n  Same feeling and I had some problems with therapy too. I wish you the very best I got a job as a housekeeper at a hotel and that was a good job for me starting out because I only had to really talk to my coworkers occasionally and hotel guests rarely. But it was enough to help me start talking more. I wish I can offer advice but I am in no position to. I guess we both have to keep on going. &gt;I attempted therapy some years ago, but the therapist was completely heartless. She worked on her computer as I sat there waiting for her to say something. This experience started this forgotten lost cause feeling that I have.\n\nMan this shit happened to me once, just sat on her computer the whole time did not ask me anything like she expected somebody with selective mutism to start the conversation. stopped going after 2 times there and got a better one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am pretty much in the same boat as you. I am trying to expand my social skills but it really feels like starting from nothing. All I really say is \"Yes/No/Yeah\", I do not really feel like I know anything to expand or create small talk that is why i am thinking about watching podcasts myself maybe it would help with having something to say or add on to stuff sometimes at least. Listening to conversations such as podcasts will probably help a lot. I am trying to do the same. I will probably start off by imitating people. You have totally got this. Wanting to make the change is half the battle! It sounds like you have got some good foundations in the things you want to achieve. You can build on those and break out what has been holding you back. \n\nSM can make you feel like you missed a class on socializing that everyone else got, but just like most things, you can get better with practice. Your brain can, as you said, rewire itself! You are not stuck!\n\nSome of the things that helped me were socializing in structured ways like improv classes and playing D&amp;D. There you can learn and improve in a space that feels safe. \n\nIf you want to play music, maybe you can find some lessons, or a community band. You might be able to meet people who you will get along well with by going to concerts or gigs of the types of music you love, especially smaller ones. Most cities and even some smaller towns have a music scene of sorts.\n\nDo not beat yourself up if progress is slow. It is a bit like getting a cast off your leg - you are not going to go off and run a marathon immediately. Instead you start with stretches, then walking, and then gently build up to being able to run. It is the same with socializing and making connections. There were times I would come home from an event I would pushed myself to go to and talk with people and I would absolutely beat myself up over how awkward I had been, but now looking back, those times were just stretches. Not every conversation has to be the marathon, some can just be stretches. \n\nBest of luck! Improv classes sound like something that would be beneficial and even enjoyable. I would like to work out my rusty vocal chords, if they are even salvageable!\n\nI would like to take music lessons some day, after learning on my own, to see what a teacher has to say about my progress. Concerts do sound like fun, but I think I can only be enticed to go if my favorite band plays, if they ever do concerts again. I got into this whole music thing thanks to me discovering them.\n\nThank you so much for the encouragement! You are thinking too much. Just do something. No one has any more significance than you. Nobody has anything figured out and nobody cares if you do or do not. Push the ego aside and throw the anxiety in the trash can. Of course you are not where you want to be but stressing it only makes it worse. You are 28 with no job, no car, and no social life. These are your cards and you are not getting new ones so make it work.", "Selective Mutism Podcast Link to the newest episode of Outloud, The Selective Mutism Podcast. We answer listeners' questions! \n\n( Thanks for sharing your story!", "Losing my English structures and vocab Okay. At home on the weekends, I use Vietnamese with my parents, and English with my brother. And then at school, I have to use English. \n\nWhen I am at school, I do not barely socialize or attempt to talk to anyone. I hope that no one wants to talk to me. Anyways, when I get asked a question, I respond back with so many stutters. And the words get switched in different orders in a sentence. Like for example, instead of saying, \u201cOh I got the water bottle from my backpack,\u201d I say sentences like, \u201cT-the, backpack I got.. oh I mean, the water bottle from my backpack.\u201d It is so frustrating, my English feels like it is worsening even though I am born here in America. \n\nI do not know about the people here in this SM community, if they are losing some of their vocab or language structure when long time no speaking. \n\n\nWhen I get home from school, I talk like crazy with my family members and such. And my English is better if I talk to my brother, it sounds less stuttery, fluent, and correctly in order. My Vietnamese is decent. \n\nAnyone else feeling the same problem? Could be any language. i feel you on this, lately i havent been stuttering too much but it can get really bad from time to time over the most simple things and its so fricking embarrassing D; i also have a problem jumbling my words. even tho i have been a native english speaker for 18 years, its like the part of my brain that forms coherent sentences just turns off I have the same problem sometimes. I am bilingual too.  I stutter and totally mix up all my grammar and words almost every time I try to talk to my classmates/teachers/etc. I think it is because my brain is so busy panicking that I have no space to form normal sentences.  It is like my brain just shuts down. When I am at home (and not panicking) I can talk just find in both german and english. I have never personally experienced it, but a linguistics class I once took taught that it is possible to get rusty with one\u2019s native language just like it is with second languages.", "Does anyone else have a deep fascination for the people they cannot actually speak to? Many people assume I do not speak because I hate, or am just not interested in, other people, but I do not think it could be any further from the truth. I tend to idolize pretty much every person I come across, and I think that is what makes it so difficult to speak to them. Does anyone else feel this way? I kind of get that, you feel like you do not want to erode their image of you, whatever that may be. Talking would erode it. I 100% agree with this. Yes, the more I admire someone, the harder it is to talk to them. For me, I think this is rooted in toxic shame. I have a deep-rooted belief that the real me is not good enough, so I have to hide my true self from other people, who I assume are good enough. The better I think they are, the more I feel compelled to hide, and that means not speaking freely. Same! In my line of work I get invited to high profile political events and I cling to colleagues because I cannot speak with anyone else attending. They try to get me to talk to the politicians, ministers... even the prime minister once! but it is like my brain just shuts down and nothing comes out \ud83d\ude2b I pretty much only have this problem with potential love interests, but I can understand this applying to pretty much anyone, whether it is a potential friend, a coworker, a professor. I think it is deeply rooted in self-esteem issues and fear of rejection. This person is so impressive, so there is so much pressure to impress them--and you feel like you are not going to add up, that as someone else said, you will erode their image of you. You also may feel unworthy of their time. You may feel afraid that you will do or say something wrong. And plus just general anxiety--the higher you regard someone, the more nervous you are going to be when talking to them. It is totally understandable.", "A topic of discussion for my fellow recovered SMs Do you guys struggle with speaking at a normal/loud volume where everyone in the room can hear you? And when you think you are speaking at a decent volume you get interrupted and get told to speak up? Because this shit always happens to me and it is so embarrassing. \n\nToday in my drawing class we were doing critiques of each other\u2019s work, and we had to get up one by one and stand in front of the class and talk a bit about what we did. That is fine for me, but as soon as I started talking (I would say I speak a level or two above a whisper in this situation, because anything more makes me extremely uncomfortable) the instructor told me I needed to be louder so everyone in the back could hear me, so I raised my voice to what felt like yelling/shouting almost(?) and I got told I still was not loud enough. \n\nIdk man, being this way makes my life way harder than it needs to be and I am trying to figure out how to project more in front of crowds/my peers. Sure enough, I am able to comfortably talk at a good volume around my close friends and family but with crowds like that it just does not happen. Anyone have any suggestions that could help me? Maybe try taking public speaking classes or theater, or get a voice coach. I am a singer, but there are speaking coaches too. There are also voice teachers and coaches on YouTube. A good coach will use different methods to teach you how to support your breathing using low belly breaths, and  to use you diaphragm for breath control, not your throat- to do this you want to push out your stomach, instead of sucking it in, when you breathe. You can try core exercises to help build up ab strength as well. I did theater as a kid, used to volunteer to read aloud in school, and and have also been singing for a number of years. When I am thinking about it, and am calm enough, I can project my voice fairly decently. This definitely takes practice though. I am naturally very vocally timid and soft-spoken, and still get severe sm around my friends-including  going mute at annoying times and getting talked over because nobody can hear me. So sort of the exact opposite of your problem lol. I understand. I am pretty much recovered, but still find myself getting quieter when I am really stressed or down. \n\nFor me, learning to project my voice so I could teach was the key. I had to reach the back of a room of 40 students and I was so quiet to begin with. \n\nI had to train up my projection. I used to practice at home by myself. It felt like I was shouting at first, but I realised it was not really shouting, just using my breath from my diaphragm. Those muscles need training, especially after emerging from SM.  \n\nAiming my voice at a distant point was another technique that helped. I was trying to speak to the clock at the back of the room. If that clock could hear me, all the kids would be able to hear me. This was also less intimidating than trying to talk to a person. \n\nTry feeling your breath as you speak. Singing exercises can help for sure, but look up teacher voice training for tips on how to be louder without wrecking your throat. \n\nYou can also reframe how you think about speaking loudly. Try to think of it as something you are doing to help others, not something you are doing for yourself. It is so easy for us to let our anxiety make us focus on ourselves. But the motivation to help others can really help. You have useful and important things to say that can help the other students in your art class. Your perspective is helpful. That happens to me all the time. I honestly think I am incapable of being loud. I feel like I am yelling, but my voice is just very small haha I know you can learn how to project our voice, but I have not looked into it much.", "3-year old with SM symptoms Hi all. Hoping for tips to help our daughter cope with SM symptoms. She is only 3 years old so we are not seeing professional help yet but curious if there are other parents who have had success helping their little ones handle the anxiety that comes with certain social situations. \n\nShe is a very talkative and bubbly little girl at home and with family/friends people she is comfortable around. She started at a new preschool around 6-months ago and is still barely talking to her teachers. We dont want her to get held back because she is not communicating at school. She does have 1-2 friends at school that she talks to and plays with. With her teachers, she will occasionally say bye but we are told she does not talk otherwise. \n\nWe tried enrolling her in various classes for fun like swim and dance. Both times she screamed that she did not want to go once we arrived at the studio. Again, we do not want to force it because the whole point of going is for her to have fun.\n\nShould we talk about it with her? Or does that make it more of a big deal? \n\nAny positive tips welcome. Here is a great resource for techniques that will help you and your child:\n\n Thanks! This course looks really informative. I have a 4y/o with SM. Do not hesitate to talk to her pediatrician ASAP.  The earlier the interventions the better! We brought it up and she chalked it up to shyness. Will continue to monitor to see if it is more serious than that. The way you describe your daughter at dance/swim is exactly like mine. People also told us it was just shyness but we knew it was something different. Finally had an evaluation and it turns out we were right so definitely listen to your gut. You know your kid best. You might be Interested in the child mind institute. They can do an evaluation via Skype. Oh god please do not listen to her. SM is so commonly brushed off as shyness but that is not it at all. My parents did the exact same with me. They took me to my pediatrician and he said it was just shyness, so they never did anything about it. But SM will continue to get worse without intervention/treatment, so I ended up regressing to the point of not being able to speak much to my own family. Please get a second opinion from a psychologist. I have twins diagnosed with SM we have been managing since they were 3, they are now 6. I would be happy to discuss it. Social anxiety can go hand in hand with SM. Birthday parties and classes are very tough. I do not think she would get held back. Maybe later a 504 or IEP. You should know for a person with SM saying thank you and goodbye are the hardest things to say. If she is saying goodbye that is a good sign. Getting started early would be better, it does not hurt to get evaluated, the treatment is behavioral therapy, it is not invasive. Send me pm if you want to chat. Our daughter (3 yo, turning 4 next month) has been diagnosed with SM. The initial reaction of the pediatrician was also that she will outgrow it. We insisted and got a referral. The therapists during the diagnosis sessions mentioned to us several times that it was important to start  therapy epigram before she starts primary school\nIn 2 years. \n\nOur daughter is enrolled in field hockey and ballet and now has swimming lessons to get her ready for the summer. She does not talk to the teachers (same in kindergarten). \n\nI have noticed that she enjoys running around and is laud in hockey. In ballet she is very shy, but is also an activity that requires silence and exact execution, which might not be good for her anxiety. It helps that the class is only 30 min long and that 3 friends of her also go. In the swimming lessons I see she is scared sometimes but still she does all the exercises and is proud of herself afterwards.\n\nWhat works for us is that me or my husband are always there during the training sessions. We also use a reward system like saying positive things about every session and ice cream after Swimming (which is common reward in the country we live in for this activity). We repeat all the positive things at home during dinner and to family and friends or show them photos. As a result, she loves sports! It is sometimes demanding for us to keep up but we feel that we should protect each environment we have conquered for now. \n\nWe also set play dates for her once a week so she has a social life. We let her wear her princess dresses/ costumes in public sometimes because she likes it but also because she learns to deal with additional attention from people. We also read books with relatable characters with SM but also characters that do what she does every week like ballet or swimming.\n\nShe talks about her \u201cfear to talk\u201d. We did not explain much about sm yet but acknowledge that she is afraid and mention that other children are also afraid and our fears as children as well. \n\nOur next step is to work with teachers and therapists together in her kindergarten. We will start in then spring and hope that the intervention will help her.", "Me too, kid. (Randomly generated dislike on virtual families 2) kind of stupid, just thought it was a funny coincidence  that is a fucking rough looking 2 year old Lmao yeah, the graphics for this game kind of suck I have downloaded this game so many times but have never fully renovated the house. It takes so long. It does. The title is actually a typo tho, this is number three. Two is my favorite tho, I put hours into that game. The way I got all of them was watching all ads available, otherwise it just takes far too long to get enough money. I did not know there was a three, is there any noticeable difference between two and three? A little bit. The house is bigger and you can choose what kinds of rooms you want rather than being stuck with certain things. There is also some kind of ghost mystery aspect to it, but so far I havent found a way to solve it nor really been affected by it.", "My Mom does not get it at all She tries to compare my lack of speaking to other people's problems and how they can go about it....I am not other people, so stop comparing me like that. I lack the motivation to speak, medication is not answer, not in my book and what I personally know from motivation, motivation is stellar whe*n* it is there.\n\nI think she is got it stuck in her head that to help me recover, she somehow needs to be hard on me....and maybe that works for other people, but I am not that kind of person, since I lack motivation being an asshole to me is not going to make me speak more, it is only going to make me want to speak less. She and my Dad work with this specialist on SM, but the thing is SM is so case by case, as far as I am concerned that 'specialist' knows jack shit when it comes to helping me. This might be a bit of a weird question but do you really need to speak? I think you can live happily without speaking. Of course it depends on what kind of person you are. If you are a homebody with only online friends and some kind of job that does not require speaking, it would be fine. Although a lot of people do not want to live that way. You could also learn sign language maybe. You might be able to tell that I do not know much about this condition hehe, but what do you think? The thing is, people seem to frame what they KNOW is an innate/genetic problem as the other person's fault, cause that is the only way they can keep their egos of being \"good people\" :/ When it comes to recovery, my Mom can learn more from this 'specialist,' but really in the end it comes down to my willingness to want something. I express to her but since I have no desire to....and since I cannot express more than simple interjections, she does not understand what I mean.....she tends to take shit personally too which is not helpful. Everything is on me, no one else. Sorry Never blame yourself.

I am in my 20's, work in retail, and I have been verbal since 6th grade. \n\nWith that said, since March 2020, I have always worn a mask while at work and I only take it off in my car. We have had several new hires in the past year and many have jokingly been like, \"oh haha I have not ever seen your/his face!\" This is the type of thing reminds me of my classmates in gradeschool saying stuff like, \"Oh please speak! Just one word! I have never heard you talk!!\" \n\nSo, whenever I am next to a coworker's car while in the parking lot or on the road at a stop light I purposefully try to hide my face. Is this something anyone else has experienced? \n\nWhen the time comes, I will definitely just rip off the mask and deal with the momentary anxiety and weirdness, but I still cannot help thinking about it... I mean, if the mask makes you comfortable, why stop? I am going to keep wearing mine long after the pandemic is over since it is been tremendously helpful for both by allergies and my social anxiety. Maybe talk to your boss and ask if this could be a reasonable accommodation for you. No I do not think it is unusual to worry about this. People will see more of \u201cthe real you\u201d and thus make more judgements (perhaps?). But consider the judgements may be good ones? She is always smiling! I did not know that! YES. Omg I thought I was the only one. I got hired in a grocery store last July (right after the mass world toilet paper shortage), anyways, I wear my cloth mask 24/7 because I actually feel more confident / myself since I can hide behind it. A lot of my co workers have made jokes like \u201comg I have not even seen (my name)\u2019s face before, and they have almost been working here a year.\u201d\n\nOne time they asked me to show them what I look like, there was all this pressure, about 2 or 3 co workers waiting for my \u201cface reveal.\u201d I was so nervous and uncomfortable I literally ran away, claiming I was late for a store sweep or something.\n\nI only take it off when I am in my car driving away. I fear so much for the day that our mask mandate is lifted and everyone takes off their masks. I have already planned that, unfortunately, I have no choice but to quit the day that happens. I just cannot deal with it. I am very self conscious about my appearance, and the fact that my co-workers are hyping up my face reveal is just the worst thing in the world for me. \n\nI am sorry if that was a rant, but anyways yes, I feel you OP.. ", "SM surrounding certain topics, not situations/people? Wondering if anyone could give me any insight about my situation?\n\n\nI am 29 and have struggled with bipolar disorder (as well as general life chaos connected to it) for 18 years. \n\nI was in and out of therapy growing up, sick enough to clearly need treatment but never able to participate or get anything out of it- I would just shut down.\n\nRight now the bipolar is pretty well managed w/ meds, but my life is still a mess. I am so fortunate to be surrounded by people who really love me and want to help me break out of the cycle I have been stuck in, but I am totally locked inside myself.\n\nA friend of mine sat me down a few days ago and tried to get me to talk to him about what was going on. I was TOTALLY unable to look at him, let alone look him in the eyes. I could basically only speak half-words...I could not get anything out. I would start trying to say something, but it was like I was totally empty and everything was locked up. \n\nA few hours later I was having easy conversation with him and several other people- laughing, joking around, really enjoying the conversation. \n\nSo my problem is not location/person-specific. Surface-level conversation about myself is difficult/uncomfortable, but I TOTALLY shut down if it starts getting deeper.\n\nI had a lot of negative experiences with trying to explain myself when I was younger- people just did not understand what was going on with me and a lot of times I was \"punished\" for my bipolar disorder (before we knew what was going on)...so I can understand why this would have started- I always felt a lot of pressure to fake it/pretend everything was fine, but I also know that the person I have mentioned in this post is totally supportive and loves me unconditionally, so I should be able to open up.\n\n\nI am not looking for a diagnosis- I am just trying to figure out how I can stop shutting down in conversations, because otherwise I feel like there is basically no hope of me ever getting healthy. I just want to know if I should be reading up on Selective Mutism/how to break out of it, or if this sounds like something else entirely?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. First of all, I apologize for the long comment... though... it might be worth a read...  \nAnyways, I am not going to pretend that I have got my own issues with this sorted out -- but that is mostly for reasons that, unfortunately, are out of my control right now. However, what I can say is that I have found the common thread in *my* issues with \"shutting down\" in the middle of conversations. Trust seems to be the biggest factor. In my case though, allowing myself to trust in my own ability to communicate with others in a way that they will understand is what really limits me on going deeper with most people -- I have very few friends because of this, and even fewer who are close to me.\n\nUltimately, I simply cannot allow the person to see me as I really am because I do not entirely know who that person is, or what will come out of them. This is not the same as not knowing who I am though. There is just this other stuff that comes out that tends to sabotage my identity when I try to reveal the real me.\n\nYou are very lucky to have people who love and care about you unconditionally. The kind of loneliness that comes from not being able to forge meaningful relationships is only exacerbated when you do not have someone there who wants to help you. I am glad you appreciate the fact that you are not alone -- even when it feels like you are.\n\nThere are very few people in this world you can just \"say anything to\" and know that they will not judge or be hurt by what you say, but will instead seek to understand the whys of that -- all without a hidden agenda of trying to judge you for it. We both know the average person does not at all respond this way, so, at least in my case, I generally just stay quiet because I am likely to say something I might not even mean if I do not.\n\nGetting to the point though...\n\nI have found that the people I am closest to are actually the hardest to talk to about things that are deeply important to me. \n\nThings that might make them think badly of me might come out of my mouth -- things I cannot change about my own thoughts or feelings -- things that might color their opinion on me in a way that would bring me to tears.\n\nOne thing I have learned through all of this at least is that, above all, truth and full-disclosure (i.e. being honest and responsible for fully disclosing the truth of who you are on ALL spheres of your life) is of the utmost importance. If you have a problem with something in your life that could involve someone else's feelings, you should always remember that if your feelings about that thing will not change -- it is worth saying, loudly -- no matter who hears it. Sometimes you have to tear down your hovel to build a proper house. And if your house is built on a crappy foundation, you need to tear that down too, or it is going to collapse at some point anyway. This is why truth and substance are of the utmost importance -- This is why they should always trump fear.\n\nI had to learn that the hard way by hurting someone in a way I did not mean, and that led to me having to rebuild a home I did not build on a strong foundation to begin with -- A home that I just could not bring myself to live in because it simply did not \"fit\" me.\n\nSo yeah -- a lot of wasted time. All because I could not open my own mouth about what mattered to me. This was all from me worrying about how I might affect someone I cared about with my feelings. It just took me a longer time to figure out that I was hurting them **more** by not opening up and showing them what was really there. After all, I cannot change the truth.\n\nThis might be relevant to you because everytime I felt like it was my turn to talk about me, or time to deepen the conversation, I always felt the \"empty\" feeling you described. That feeling always arose because the list of things I could talk about was always \"blank\" because all of those topics were deep, underlying things that I simply cannot share with \"just anyone\" -- and sadly, this is actually what is keeping my SM going to this day.\n\nI think BP is something that goes along with SM sometimes though -- maybe at least one part of it is that you notice your moment-to-moment feelings going up and down very quickly and have stifled your own ability to speak freely as a defense-mechanism triggered to avoid you saying something socially \"out of sequence\" to the overall mood/tone of the conversation?\n\nUnfortunately I do not know how to help without knowing more in terms of specifics (SM expresses very differently from one person to the next), but I do hope something I have said sparks some semblance of understanding for you.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to speak more about this. \n\nIt sounds like we have got some things in common with how it expresses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "I am back with questions\u2026 Hi again, I posted a while back about a character I am writing who has SM, and I have been working really hard to accurately represent him, especially when he is thinking about how his selective mutism impacts his life/friends/self/etc. \n\nI know that, like anything, SM is different for everyone, but have any of you found ways to manage or \u201cwork through\u201d it? If so how? \n\nAm I correct in comparing it to anxiety/depression where there are ways to manage and \u201covercome\u201d the symptoms?(it is my understanding that SM is a subsection/symptom of anxiety\u2026 is this accurate for people who experience it) If so, what has helped on your experience? If not, please help me get back on track!\n\nIt is really important for me to represent my character properly, I am sure I will still mess things up but I do not want him to be contrived or display a romantic version of selective mutism, I want him to be real!\n\nAnything helps! Thanks all! From what I understand about selective mutism, it can be separate from anxiety and it can be brought on by trauma, but most people with sm also have anxiety.\nI think some people use nonverbal ways of communicating, like shaking and nodding the head, or shrugging the shoulders, and some people have used cards. Sorry if that is no what you were looking for. Well, not sure if this is everyone else's experience, but for me, I can sometimes get through stuff with an \"I do not care mindset.\" For instance, in a new environment with new people, I just have to say, \"I am never going to see these people again, so who cares if I mess up and embarrass myself?\" Or for presentations, I go in not caring what grade I get, and do no practice and just read directly off the slides like they always tell you not to.\n\nI can offset the anxiety to a degree with this method, but it is important to note it can lead to disastrous consequences. For instance, the last presentation I gave in college, I got lectured by the teacher about how he could not even hear me the whole time, in front of the whole class, and it was mortifying. And a job interview where I told them my greatest weakness was communicating, the guy said, \"I am glad you admitted that, because I noticed. Let us get you some resources to work on that. Blah blah overly helpful...\", I was horribly embarrassed, but I took comfort knowing I would at least never have to see those guys again. Well, guess what? They actually hired me, and I did not really have much option but to accept.\n\nSo, I am not sure if it applies to everyone, but I think if you absolutely need an SM character to do something they are not capable of doing, this might be a way to do it, within the suspension of disbelief kept intact. I would include tragic consequences if I went that route, keeping in mind it is a crutch, and not really a cure or rehabilitation. Ideally, I would like to see the opinions of some others here to see if they find it viable or not.", "Diagnosed as 6yo, I am 21 Now, still got it, having a job is incredibly hard, cannot talk to customers, cannot answer phone calls, etc. Just started therapy after all this time, hope it is not to late to help me  You got this.

I do not have a great relationship with my dad and he thinks that is why I do not talk to him (he does not know I have SM). I do not know how I should tell him because he will probably think it is just an excuse. \nIt sucks. I am the exact same :/ Oof, that sucks :( He knows I have sm and essentially treats me like a 5 yo (I am 16) and then acts surprised when I do not respond to him. The fact that he knows makes it even worse Tell me about it i am the exact same!! he is convinced that i do not talk to him because of our shitty relationship (i used to speak to him) and both me and my mom have let him know i have SM but he will not listen. he thinks that it is just an excuse and that my mom has brainwashed me/we both have some ulterior motive or something against him. it used to bother me, but now it is just more humorous than anything. anyway, i hope you can tell him soon. i know it is scary, but you got to just go for it \ud83d\udc95 I am the most non-violent person and i still want to punch him. I think I would if my muscles actually worked haha same, but we actually have a mostly okay relationship. Except he is an alcoholic, has anger issues, and would yell a lot all through my childhood.

Cannot talk to my dad either.", "Is it just social anxiety or is it SM? I can say hi to people when they greet me, but when they ask me a question for example I just freeze up and not a single word can come out. If they ask yes or no questions all I can do is nod. What are your thoughts? Remember, love, selective mutism literally means \u201cselective.\u201d It is a misnomer, really. The term suggests the suffering person has a choice in when to be selective. It is not really a decision we can make. Subconsciously, when we feel safe in an environment, we feel it is either safe or unsafe to speak. Saying \u201chi\u201d or \u201chello\u201d to anyone in general is usually a pretty safe thing to do. When we are expected to participate in a conversation things become a little tricky. You are a very smart person.\n\nSubconsciously, things begin to happen after we say \u201chi.\u201d \n\nAfter \u201chi,\u201d comes \u201chow are you?\u201d\n\nSo for us it is.. do they really want to know? Are they just being polite? If I say I am okay they will think I am being impolite. Should I be truthful? Should I say I am okay? Should I say I am great? Should I say how are you? How is the weather? What if they ask me how my day is? What if I forget their kids name? What if they...\n\nThe problem in selective mutism is that we understand communication is personal and people make communication impersonal. \n\nWhat became healing to me was when I was able to shift my focus internally. This happens when we are able to set up boundaries. I was only really able to do this with my psychologist. It took a tremendous amount of effort and a few years of therapy. My psychologist was so dedicated to me because he understood personally how I felt. He began to help me experience life from an internal perspective.\n\nWhen someone greets me now, I realize someone is asking me to share something about myself with them. And when I answer, I am giving them permission. And we do not have to give everyone permission. I found so much power in that. \n\nSo, now.. when someone asks me: hey, how are you!? I can say great thanks! And keep walking.. or if I really care.. I can say, dude, I had such a shit day, man.. how is about you?

Thank you \ud83d\ude0a I completely agree. you are super knowledgeable\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am also happy you were able to find a therapist Thanks so much for that validation.

Could anyone share some advice on how they were able to cope with SM? I was very shy as a kid. I remember ending up peeing in my pants at school because I could not ask permission to go to the bathroom. I was quiet in class and I remember not being good in speaking English, which I knew contributed to my inability to speak up. I was scared of being judged by my teachers or classmates. I was scared of being embarrassed. When I grew up, it became more manageable. I would still feel nervous (hands very cold), and I would often pop a candy into my mouth before a presentation, but I was able to deliver/do the task at hand. I experienced working in a toxic environment where some people had bullying tendencies. They would say things that were meant for me to overhear and I felt attacked. I was doing well at work initially but I started feeling overly stressed that I started losing my appetite and I could no longer speak without popping a candy into my mouth. I felt judged every time I spoke up or tried to excel. I left the company due to stress and found myself working in a company with kinder people. However, my condition has only gotten worse. I cannot talk to people without candy in my mouth and it has been frustrating. I have avoided social interactions because of it, and I cannot seem to find a way to manage it. I feel depressed and I could no longer function normally. I personally do not know anyone who has a similar experience. Any help or advice on coping would be appreciated. Thank you I was pretty much exactly like you as a kid and now I am in my 30's as well. I have been fortunate not to have the bad work environment as an adult, but I would imagine that I would feel just like you do. Honestly, I have avoided making changes to my work, like getting a better job or taking classes, because I am scared that the social aspect would be too hard, so you are brave to have even been in a situation that you had to deal with that. It is awful that even adults can be such bullying assholes.  \nI think it is normal for people to revert to whatever their childhood coping mechanisms were when they are feeling extra stressed as adults. Like, I have seen friends who had recovered from eating disorders or substance abuse for years go back to it when things are really hard- it makes sense that we would go back to what we did as kids, too. As much as adult me understands that SM is not really the best coping strategy, it feels soothing in the moment. Part of it for me was sheer dumb luck. \n\nA stray cat forcibly adopted me and I started at a magnet school for high school, 120 kids in my program and one of them decided we are going to be friends. Honestly did not feel like I had a choice at the time for either, but they were two relationships that gave me a desire to talk I did not otherwise have.\n\nThen, despite being Unusually quiet, did not like being told I could not do things and when I ducked up my first job interview I said never again, and kept interviewing for customer service positions until I got one  and worked everyday at talking to people even if it was only, hi how are you, how can I help. For that, I actually carried a notebook with example dialogues for every situation I thought I was going to face regularly. \n\nTook 5 years at least to be pretty decent at it, but 10+ years later I still have tough moments, especially if I have to use a language other than English, which makes me feel like I am as bad as I ever was.\n\nI guess, the key is planning and practice. If you are really lucky you will have friendships and relationships who make it easier. In the same boat.\n\nWas a shy kid. In my 30s now and marooned far away from all that I am familiar with. I am not fluent in the local language although I am fairly good at it. I have no social life just because I am not willing to make mistakes or maybe I do not care to fit in. In social settings, I go stiff and mute although I understand every spoken word and have a lot to say. At work, if I hand out my contact number to clients, I ask them to msg me so that I have the time to weigh my response. The sad part is that I have become comfortable in my silence and solitude and that just is not who I used to be. I feel exactly the same about being stuck in the same work routine. The social aspect of change brings about this irrational fear that often defies the desire to have or do something better Glad that you found people/friends who made you feel better. I also hate being told that I could not do things, and I would usually rebel against it. Just like you, I have tried client facing jobs, and I think it made my condition better somehow probably because of the exposure. But the past few years have been tough, like I do not know what would work anymore omg, I took a language class once and the teacher was just like, \"Just talk, the only way to learn is to make mistakes!\" and I was just like, well, guess I am never learning that, then. Make mistakes, pshaw! Very familiar. I am scared of making mistakes myself and of being judged as a result. I think about it now and it seems that it has something to do with image and other people\u2019s perception, which us ironic because I also do not mind not fitting in. I have a few close friends but I am usually my own company. I would also go mute and stiff even when I have a lot to say. I am afraid that I, too, am becoming comfortable with my solitude. I want to break free. I want to be able to talk like a normal person :( If I may ask, did anxiolytic work for you? Many people think people with SM refuse to talk.   It is frustrating because we usually want to but we cannot :| The anxiolytic for sure helps me calm down. It is a prescription drug and I have taken it only a few times - before my thesis presentation, my sister's wedding and the sort. I do not think of it as a permanent solution Dude, same !\n\nI'am currently trying to get into as many social situations as possible, it is awkward as hell as i do not say anything, but i figured that with enough exposure, it would go away ? If I may ask, do you still suffer from SM now? How do you manage it aside from taking anxiolytic? That is brave of you. Do you notice changes in your response with more exposure? Are you able to talk easily now as you choose to get yourself into social situations? It is slightly better, still a long way to go :)\n\nBut I had a major improvement in my body language and how i handle my anxiety, i appear calm and smile and laugh, i still cant talk much That last sentence is so true for me. I can only manage with my mom but it has been like this forever That is improvement, nonetheless. Happy for you :)", "Is selective mutism also people choosing not to talk? Just uh wanted to ask something.\nIs selective mutism only not being able to talk? What if I decide to just stop talking? \nWhen I was younger (14-15) I decided to stop talking for around half a year or so. Just did not speak to anyone. I still wrote and used a children version of sign language in my country.\nBecause of me not speaking and other stuff my parents put me in a mental hospice.\nThere I met one girl which during those months was the only one I talked to and even then it was here and there, and only when we were alone. And the only reason for that is because she had an anime voice she hid and used a fake voice (she was able to initiate other voices easily due to a medical condition caused by her mother) and her sharing it with me caused me to share me speaking with her.\n\nAfter a few months I got out of there and started studying in a boarding school. But after a month or so there the principal made an demand; either I start talking or I get kicked out. That eventually forced me back into talking. (Without me actually bring interested in doing so. I did not want to live at home, and wanted to live at a boarding school for a while beforehand. Did not want to give it up)\n\n\n\n\nAnyways. Reason I am asking is because I never really looked into that. I was just like yeah that happened. Idk why but that felt like what I should do. Do not want to talk.\nOver the years I still prefered being quiet and when upset I could stop talking for a day or a few (many times people ignored the fact that I did not want to talk and wanted to be alone and left by myself which just made it worse in my opinion.)\nCurrently I am having family issues. And due to those family issues I decided that I no longer want to speak to my mother. So I just do not.\nThat, alongside the fact my dad wants to see if I have Asperger's syndrome and me talking to my friend, made me wonder and google about selective mutism, which is apparently a severe form of anxiety? Did not know about that but I guess that explains the anxiety meds I take.\nBut in what I found it says that the people are unable to talk, not choose not to talk.\nSo after this all long and useless post probably... Is selective mutism just people bring unable to talk, or also people choosing to stop talking?", "Dnd with SM I figured out an easier way to play dnd even with SM today! I am going to type what I would say into google translate (I can type faster than I can physically write), and then use the speech thing so google will say it for me. I am going to use this until I am eventually able to speak again with my dnd party (hopefully sometime soon, it is pretty small so there is a lot less anxiety with them, and they are also pretty close friends) Awesome that your friends are so supportive and understanding. I am sure you can speak to them soon.", "Mother of a SM daughter My daughter has had this from basically birth.  It is gotten progressively worse over time.  She is 13 now and school has become a very very hard place for her to be.  Her anxiety has gotten so bad that she has constant stomach pains, nausea and vomiting.  I am going to take her to a dr this week.  Has anyone here been in medication for SM and has it helped? Things got worse for me as well around puberty. A psychiatrist is a good place to start, but it can be a long time until you see any positive effects with medication. I was on my first med at around that age (zoloft) and 8 years and 5 meds later I have just recently found a med that helps some with my anxiety. It is really trial and error with medication, you never know what will be effective.\n\nI am not for or against medication, that is your choice and your daughter's. I recovered using CBT and exposure therapy. A doctor is a good start, but someone with SM could really benefit from a therapist who is experienced in treating anxiety and can work through the anxiety with them.\n\nThat is all the advice I have right now. I hope all goes well for you and your daughter. Personally, medication never helped me; tried zoloft prozac and a few other ones i cant remember the name of. Some made me tired some made me eat alot. Some killed all my emotions and i was just an empty shell of a person. None helped with anxiety or ability to speak. However it could affect her completely different. Things that did help tho where exersizes to get more comfortable speaking. Ordering food at places drinks at starbucks etc. just little tasks that take basic human interaction. But that was from my ability to look back and think \"that sucked, but it wasnt too bad i guess\" might not be like that for her. Is really a difficult situation. I have taken 6 different medications, and none of them helped me. Meds alone will not treat SM. There needs to be a combination of school support, (cannot stress the importance of that enough) therapy like CBT and controlled exposure therapy, and understanding. That does not mean do not try medicine. The meds may not make it easier for her to speak, but could help her anxiety overall. My daughter is also 13 and starting high school next fall.  She is been really good the past few years because she has two best friends that she has become really comfortable with and they understand her issues.  They always have her back.  I requested months ago that she have friends placed in her classes next year.  We got her timetable and she knows no one!  The guidance counsellor did not even attempt to put her in classes with people she knows.  All her friends got in classes where they know lots of kids and my daughter got no one.  I am beyond livid with how cavalier they are being with her IEP and diagnosed condition.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy daughter does not want to be on medication and I do not think I would insist on it. It has to be her choice.  I just wish people would take it more seriously, rather than believing she is just shy and needs to get over it", "Do I have SM? I got diagnosed with social anxiety at a very young age and was in speech classes all throughout grade school to help me with my stutter. I was bullied a lot because I would not talk much and when I did talk it was stuttering. As an adult, nothing has changed. I still have a bad stutter and I still do not talk much. In social situations I will not speak out loud but I will be talking to myself in my head (and when I am alone I have full conversations with myself) I have certain triggers that trigger me to go mute. For example me and my significant other were arguing one night and it got really heated, I already was only replying with one word but then something switched and I went mute. She was crying and begging for me to speak but I could not. She has even yelled at me, telling me to talk and I still will not speak. There multiple situations that I cannot speak in, and they happen on a daily bases. It is not that I do not want to talk because I try so hard to just say something but I can not. It is so annoying and frustrating, I just want to know what is wrong with me.

I have gone out to pick-up food more for my family, but that is sort of an endurance exercise in the sense of it. Every time I do that, it will get easier but it was already possible. Though where talking matters most or where the problem is most prevalent is with my family. As my posts have gone down in frequency here, so has my motivation/progress in talking to my family. I will go maybe about 10 words a day these last 2 weeks.\n\nThe motivation is dwindling and I have gone back to watching Netflix and playing Minecraft, when back in July I opted against anything that was not in the name of progress regarding talking. I did not even want to write this now, but it got easier as I started to.\n\nI feel like the reaction to me talking has ramped back up as my Dad says \"I am proud of you,\" each time I go to pick of food, and I appreciate it but it just makes me feel demotivated because I specifically informed everyone to not act a big deal over me talking or doing things. It is a big reason as to why I will not do things for myself or want to speak. There is no motivation anymore, and there is not even the motivation to tell my Mom I no longer have the motivation to speak. Although I feel like I could if I wanted to.\n\nThere is/was nothing besides it, being a little bit easier to go pick-up food, I can look back on and say I improved on during the month of August. July I can, I made HUGE leaps in regards to my mindset and I was eating better, I was exercising (doing pushups daily). Now I eat slightly worse, and have missed on the pushups (doing it about 3 days so far this month, where I did it almost daily during July).\n\nI think it has a lot to do with this girl or the reason I was motivated, I think now so much time has past I just see no hope there in regards to anything ever happening with that. I think I clung on heavily to that dream for my own motivation to speak...though now that is no longer there in my mind....and I feel like everything is just returning to how it was before July ever happened.....I wrote something the other day and it basically tells of how I have lost all motive, there is really no aspirations to my life at the current moment, other than continuing on living, for what? Idk.\n\nI was in the car going to the city this month (New York) to eat with my family and there was no real excitement or motivation boost going there, in the month of July doing something as such would give me huge motivation boosts, it felt like I was doing something, but now it is back to feeling like nothing. This is really a jumble of thoughts, but basically progress has halted, and I am just indifferent to the fact of that. There is no real concern over my lack of progress and I feel like I should have some, or more than I do now. Do you think you have ADHD? I have had a seemingly unnatural motivation with many things, and realizing I have many of the symptoms of ADHD explains a lot. Technically I have not been diagnosed but I have almost every defining symptom (short term memory loss (while having extremely good long term memory), trouble focusing, insomnia every single night since I was very little, constant fatigue)\n\n\\*I mean ADHD as well as selective mutism, I have both I am not too sure but I would not be that surprised if I did. When I was feeling really motivated I would move around a lot and shake my leg excessively, in a way I felt like it kept me in that motivated mindset and if I stopped shaking it would subside and I did not want it to. Motivation is nothing more than a feeling. My therapist taught me to turn motivation into into a habit instead. Everyone is motivation (you do not have to have SM to feel motivated) goes up and down during the day, week, months or maybe even years. Motivation is created by your Dopamine, that is is your achievement hormone. That is why motivation is nothing more than a feeling and our emotions goes up and down all the time, again that is normal to feel. \nAny habit can be created within 18-254 days\u2026 so I instead of forcing yourself to do something, create it into a habit. Then your brain will automatically do it without you realising. \n\nI hope you feel better soon! \ud83d\udc9c", "living like this forever after trying for so long, i am coming to terms with the fact that this is what my life is always going to be. i am unable to find the strength to push beyond my comfort zone. is anyone else making peace with living the rest of their life like this? how are you coping? i am extremely lonely, unhappy, and i feel empty knowing i will never have the life i want, but i am unable to hit any goals permanently. so i guess it is this until death. tips? If that is what you want, go for it. You will never make progress if you dont want it enough. \n\nIf you do want to someday get better, you will have to find something to motivate you. That is obviously harder said than done, but there is not much else you can do. I suspect having this diagnosis has liberated you to just accept the situation and not try. You now have an excuse.. \nThis is the danger of the diagnosis. I have two daughters with \u201cselective mutusm\u201d which is essentially social anxiety \nI had it too.. I did not have a single social engage to during my four years of high school. I ended happily married with a prestigious job and two great kids. \nI did not give up .. because it was a matter of doing what I needed to do to get what I wanted. \nSlowly with each step I got stronger and it gets easier.\nThe irony is that I ended up in a better place and more secure than pretty much everyone else. \n \nYou do not do that by giving up .. but by finding steps you can take each day  where you can improve and moving towards your goals. \n\nI agree with the person who commented before. You need motivation. There was no internet when I was young so you had to connect socially in person. Maybe you should cut out all of the online activities and then when you are really lonely you will be motivated to try to connect to people. \nThat is what did it for me.  I remember in college counting how many days it had been since I had spoken to anyone.. \nthe loneliness was motivating For me, absolutely not. I have had to go through a lot (not just as a mute) to get where I am now, so I just keep going.\n\nAs for a suggestion, have you tried anxiety medication? I did not fix all my problems, but it definitely brought me up to a point where I was not completely socially disabled. Heres what I do If I want motivation, I play my \"get a grip\" playlist and I use all my energy forcefully drag myself to finish a small task like cleaning my room, I then get this burst of sensation of accomplishment and it makes me want to do more shit, so I take this chance and get on a video game where there is voice chat such as VRchat. I go up to a group of ppl in the lobby and bite the bullet and try to squeak a word out. All i could get out was a pathetic \"hello\" and I pussied out of course. I did expect judgment and rejection but obviously it wont stop me from pursuing absolute freedom like Im only just getting started. and i could only imagine the transcending feeling of overcoming this damn curse like I will be happier than the happiest mofos on this rock. The only way over it is through it. Have you connected with one of the Centers that specialize in the disorder? They will help you set realistic, incremental goals. You can learn to not let the anxiety control you but you have to work at it everyday. I have been in a similar point in my life where I felt the same way and wanted to just give up, isolate myself, never talk to people or have friends ever again. It is been 2 years and I no longer feel lonely because I managed to recently find some nice online friends who are always there for me. I fully believe that you will be in a better place some day, it really may not seem like it at the moment, but please do not give up. Give yourself time, and take small steps whenever you feel ready. Start with finding a community of people online who have similar interests to you, I suggest discord servers. During the time of isolating myself I coped by watching a LOT twitch streamers, being in the chat feels like a little community. I managed to make a friend by talking to another person who watched the same streamers that I did. I am not coming to terms with it exactly, but I find it hard to picture I can just change to a normal life as it is hard to picture myself living a normal life. I cannot imagine me being like this at 25, that disturbs me.\n\nI think I need the right motivation, until then though...indefinite is the feeling. Eventual death follows. Though rn, I feel ok. I take things I think each day and grow from it.", "Talking about difficult topic So, there is this girl who like always say \" hi\" to me. Up to now, we only have a few small talks; all went horribly wrong because i am extremely anxious. Sometimes, I can only manage to said \"I cant talk\", then looking at the ground. She still waves at me if she see me. I can tell she was a good person. I plan to tell her about this SM thing, but I never officialy diagnose; so I feel no proof to tell her. Besides, whenever I see her, I was frozen with a incessant smile (thanks to wearing a mask, she cant see it). I plan to do it via facebook message; but i kind of getting discouraged because I sent one before to my younger cousin, and she never said anything back since.\nOther people would not even try to talk to me anymore because I usually just answer their questions. Because the way I speak, and my postures, people may think that I have no interest in them. While in reality, I just like to listen to them talking. \nSo, this girl actually make me feel like to connect to society again. I start trying out some productive stuff.  But when I start doing it, my brain like \"imagine what would it be if I talk to a person\". In short, I cant focus. I think it because I feel guilty because she was being nice.\nI dont want to revert back to my past self so I figure I would write down my loop thought here. If anyone have any advice, feel free (you also have my thank just because you have make it to this point reading my nonsense). I am sorry your cousin never got back to you. But, I would suggest just because one person did not get back to you, does not mean the rest will not. Just tell her how you feel \u2014 even messaging her is a great idea! If it helps, I recently sent a message to a small group of friends of 3 saying \u201cI know I do not talk a lot because it is a struggle for me, but I really appreciate our friendship\u201d and I got nothing but positive feedback. She sounds like a good person and I am sure if you write to her something similar, I am sure she will understand! Good friends accept you for who you are and build you up! \n\nYou got this, friend! Try to reach out.  She has not given up, maybe someone in her family has sm and she understands.\n\nSo please do not give up. If she is still talking to you, still trying to connect, then your conversations did not go \u201chorribly wrong\u201d in HER mind. And little cousins are not the best measure of your social skills. Could they have been busy that day? Or forgotten to respond because they were wrapped up in their own drama? Or just a punk? If you are too afraid to message her, try messaging someone else, another family member, or a friend, or even your cousin again. I know it is SO HARD to take that first step, and even harder when they do not respond, but if you can do it, keep trying. Even if it is only once a week or even once a month, and even if they do not respond they way you hoped, you still tried, and got some practice for the next time. And right now is the perfect time to try since no one will judge you for talking online more than in real life, and in real life no one will judge you for keeping your physical distance or having awkward posture. i would just go for it! from what you describe she does seem like a nice girl if she waves at you everyday, despite knowing it is hard for you to respond. think of it as a golden opportunity. she is like opening her arms to you and you got to meet her halfway. Hey there.. I know this will sound crazy, but you may not have to explain yourself at all. She already likes you. That is the best. When someone is attracted to you for who you are and the things you do, and maybe even your behaviors. I have always found quieter, more introspective men charming. I love to watch people deep in thought and fall in love with them from afar because it seems as though that is the only time people are really themselves. If it makes you feel better, of course tell her anyway you want, but please do not sell yourself short just because you communicate differently. \n\nAs a grown adult with a family of my own, I can remember several times in my life struggling with the ups and downs selective mutism offered me. The older I get, the quieter Ive become. I just do not have anything to add to conversation anymore. It seems so trivial. I am finding my serenity alone, maybe it is how I am coping with the pandemic.\n\nPlease, do not try and change yourself for anyone. You are loved exactly how you are for who you are by many people, even if that is hard to hold right now. Focus on loving yourself, and let this girl love you anyway she wants. Let her see you, friend, she might understand you better than you think.", "Silence strengthens observational skills I think a life of silence strengthens other areas.\n\nThe other day I was watching an interview on TV with my friend and I noticed the guy on TV lying. His facial expressions and tone of voice gave it away. When I mentioned it to my friend he did not get it at all. This happens a lot to me. Has anyone else experienced this? I seem to have an easier time than others telling when people are feeling bad/upset and understanding why that is before I have asked how they are. I have never thought of if it was related to SM but it really might be. I am in college for psychology (to be a therapist in the future) and it is been useful with friends and will be in the future career-wise.\nAlso, people tend to have a really hard time projecting tone through text but I have never had a problem doing that in casual text-based conversation bc I am so used to communicating that way and having to use punctuation and formatting to convey my meaning. It is like daredevil.  The other senses get strengthened if you take one away.", "The text I am too afraid to send to my boyfriend\u2026..

I just want the pain to stop. \ud83d\udde3\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "I am pursuing a career in early childhood education. If you are on the SM discord, you might have seen me asking for advice regarding my college major (nursing or teaching?). Anyways, I thought pretty deeply about it. In the end I seemed to care a lot less about the money I could earn as a nurse, compared to as a teacher... and I cared more about the job itself. I hate school for about half the time I spent in it, starting from middle school. I was often depressed, and my anxiety caused a whole lot of social isolation. The SM did not help, either. I am mostly recovered now, I guess? I still have a ton of anxiety and cannot talk to the people who know me as the girl who cannot talk, but I can talk to strangers, children, and all of my coworkers. \n\nI thought of how many of my teachers were not helpful; either they added to my anxiety and depression or were too passive to care too much about my condition.\n\nI thought back to the time when I was in the fifth grade and met a little boy in Kindergarten who had not spoken at school all year. I knew exactly how he was feeling. At the time I did not know about SM, so I could not let any of the confused staff know what was going on.\n\nI thought back to all the jokes, lectures, and other different treatment I received from my teachers and peers.\n\nAnd I thought that I did not want to be like that. I want to be the teacher who does exactly what their students need. I want to be a safe, welcoming person at school. I want to allow children to love school. I want to be able identify SM in young children before they grow up and it becomes so much more harder for them to recover. I want to be able to positively impact all children, regardless of whether they have anxiety or not. I want them to be able to enjoy school and their youth.\n\nAt the same time, I have always enjoyed tutoring. I love to offer my help to friends when they are stuck on a math problem. History, sociology, psychology, all the different sciences (except physics), algebra (no geometry because ew math with shapes)!! I love learning about all of those!! I love sharing my knowledge with others!! I like helping others!! So that is also why I decided to become a teacher.\n\nSo I decided to become a teacher. I know what to do based off my own experiences, but my experiences are not the world's... so I would like to know some things you wished teachers did. It can be for anxiety or any other condition or problem you had. What do you wish teachers did for you and/or others? There is not much teachers can do to with one student when they have to manage 30 other children. I would not put this much pressure on it, just try to make them comfortable and learn their boundaries over time. Have you considered speech-language pathology? I could not decide between teaching and nursing and ended up becoming an SLP and love it. A lot of the goals you have for your career sound like the things I love about SLP. Full disclosure, I do not have SM, I subscribe here because many of my students have anxiety around communication and I like to read about experiences from you guys\u2019 perspective. Hey. Teacher for 15 years here. Had SM most of my life through my 20s. It is an amazing career. Being a teacher helped me find my voice. Good luck That is true. I do not want to put all my focus and effort into one child when I have a whole class to care for, but it would definitely help to know even the little things that could help (such as learning boundaries, as you suggested). I have not actually! I will definitely look into it, but a majority of the reason why I wanted to go into nursing was more about me liking hospitals and the high pay... and less about wanting to treat others. I feel that at some point the pay will not satisfy me anymore and I will come to dread my job... so I might as well do something I enjoy rather than hate, high pay or not. Wow, really? I am glad you recovered, and through teaching! And thank you :) Yes! SLPs can work in a wide variety of settings- hospital, school, private practice, and more. So you could decide what setting you want to work in after getting your degree and the pay is on par with nursing.  I am more into the educational setting so I work in a school and spend all day working with kids 1:1 or in small groups, kind of like what you described when you talked about enjoying tutoring. Definitely with checking out", "making selective mutism accurate Hii! thank you so much for reading this post in advance. so, i am planning on making a character with SM and my biggest concern is representing this condition in the best way possible. i managed to gather some information thanks to the posts on this sub reddit, however i want to make sure that i got everything right. feel free to correct me and even add some more information! thank you so much in advance. \n1) the most common alternatives for communication are ASL and writing. ASL however can sometimes generate anxiety in public setting because the person might feel like they are being stared at. \n2) some people with SM will try and avoid social situations all along and they communicate only when extremely necessary \n3) when experiencing serious anxiety, mutism can target all the other forms of communication. doing basic actions like nodding and shaking your head can become difficult \n4) past trauma can trigger episodes of mutism \n5) drawing to communicate can be as difficult as signing in ASL or writing \n6) strong emotions such as rage can make a person temporarily break out of their mutism \n7) some people find difficult to deal with complex topics (unless it personally interests them) \n8) the feeling of trying to communicate with words with SM is mind going blank or mind and body being disconnected (the person wants to speak however the body does not respond and remains silent) \n\nthank you so much in advance for the answers and again, feel free to add things in the comments! every contribuition is very much appreciated Unrelated but I wish ppl would stop thinking sm is cute or quirky. Like the ppl who think sm people are \u201cshy UwU\u201d like no we are not. If we had a choice to get rid of this condition we would with no hesitation. Twitter users putting sm in their bio and other mental disorders to seem quirky and different pisses me off. I have had classmates and teachers speak to me like I was mentally retarded or as if I was a baby. It is fucking humiliating and degrading 1. ASL in America only \ud83d\ude09. It is also worth noting than some people find that writing can be anxiety inducing too. Plus, what use is knowing a sign language if most other people who are not deaf, HoH or mute cannot speak it? (Plus whether someone knows a sign language would depend on if they were given access to that kind of help).\n2. SM can come in a variety of \u201cseverities\u201d. Most severely many people are unable to speak at all, even IF necessary- see cases of children being bullied/abused/denied food and education for not talking etc. Some people have \u201cprogressive mutism\u201d (not a diagnostic or academic term) where they are able to respond when spoken too or if necessary, usually this is due to partial recovery.\n3. Yes.\n4. Trauma can trigger mutism, including SM. However, the VAST majority of SM is in NO WAY linked to trauma. Most people with SM have it from a very young age with no direct cause.\n5. \u2026\n6. I have never seen anyone say this, until this thread which had someone else asking about that. (\n7. It is worth noting here that there is a difference between a \u201ccomplex\u201d topic and an \u201cemotionally charged\u201d topic. Also a difference between a topic someone is \u201cinterested in\u201d and a topic they \u201cdo not know anything about\u201d.\n8. There is a variety of ways that people explain how they experience it. What you said is the case for some people but for others it is different. (In short, yes, for some). thank you so much! about point 4, still on the topic of trauma, i read that mutism that comes from trauma or neglect is known as psychological mutism. is that correct? I get spoken to in the tone mostly used for babies and dogs by most people growing up. I have always thought was funny (in an annoying sort of way) seeing as we were the same age.\n\nBut yeah, I really hate the shy, cute, quirky stereotypes. 1. Always hated when people assumed I knew sign language growing up. I do not know it and do not really have a desire to learn it. I do not communicate by writing either, but I am sure there are people with SM who could use either of these methods. \n2. Nope, I do not  try to avoid social situation, I just never get into them in the first place. If I try to enter a social situation (with a teacher or boss) I just end up standing there awkwardly because I cannot be like \"Hey, I have to ask you about-\" to get their attention. A second nope for only speaking in 'extremely necessary' circumstances, I am more likely to cry and/or run away from my problems (literally run away).\n3. Not really. I am always able to do the yes and no gestures.\n4. Not everyone with SM has it due to trauma. I do not have it due to trauma so I will not answer this one.\n5. I do not know why you would draw to communicate instead of writing?\n6. Kind of? It is very rare to be angry enough to yell at someone. When I was on meds I got into a physical fight with another guy at school. I pushed him and hit him in the face, I yelled some things at him but they came out pretty stifled. \n7. Not really sure what you mean by complex topics. I am shit at math, but that is not an SM thing, lol.\n8. I would not say 'mind going blank'. I will answer in my mind quite eloquently, however on the outside nothing happens. i have some questions. so in point number 6 you mentioned that you where on medication, so is medication sometimes part of SM treatment? and as for point number 8, would you describe it more as body and mind being disconnected or like making up a scenario in your head (i am sorry if this comes out the wrong way, I tried my best to put it into words) That is not my speciality, but from my limited understanding there is not a complete agreement. SM would imply that the person can speak in some situations, whereas \\*some\\* people with trauma are completely unable to speak in all situations, which some might not consider 'selective' mutism. Assuming that the mutism is situational and not global, i have heard terms ranging from reactive mutism to traumatic mutism. But again: I am not an expert.\n\nOther disorders do not change their name depending on whether or not trauma was the cause (EG. schozophrenia triggered by trauma is just as much schizohrenia as schizophrenia developed without trauma). So many people with mutism due to trauma are diagnosed with, or else relate to, the SM label. As long as the mutism is dependent on situation or person (ie. selective) and caused by anxiety it seems to fall under SM according to the DSM. ok thank you so much for clearing things up! Yeah, depending on what type of doctor you go to. A therapist will try and teach you ways to become more normal I guess (it did not work out for me), a psychiatrist will prescribe medication. I have taken Fluoxetine and Lexapro in the past, they are SSRIs and commonly used to treat anxiety and depression. They did help me start speaking to some people, but they also had some negative affects on me (aggression, violent thoughts, lack of impulse control).\n\nFor point 8, I would say it is more of a disconnect. For example, if someone at work come up and asks if I had a good weekend in my head I come up with speech to say like \"Yeah it was pretty good. Wrote over 2,000 words for my novel.\" but that never comes out of my head so I will just nod yes. Or if they ask a non yes or no question, I can sometimes say a one word response. I hope that makes sense?\n\nAs for making up scenarios in my head, that does happen, but it is more like a daydreaming thing. Like when I am by myself cutting open boxes (I work in a warehouse) I might imagine striking up a convo with my coworker like \"So what do you like to listen to while you are working? I remember you mentioning you have never listened to My Chemical Romance before so I was curious what your favorite music genre was?\". I suppose that stems from the fact that, like food and water, humans also have a need for socialization which is something people with SM are starved for.\n\nSorry if that was a bit rambly. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. it was not rambly in the slightest do not worry, it was super helpfull! thank you so much! i should be the one apologising for asking so many questions but i have a crippling fear of portraying selective mutism in an incorrect way 1) does not fully apply to me cuz I could still blurt out words/sentences if I needed to. So I did not need asl. But I had a hard time with writing too cuz words did not flow to my brain that well or quickly. Writing was anxiety inducing in its own way but not as bad as speaking since I could revise what I wrote \n\n2) This completely applies to me. On rare occasions when I attend a social event, I usually feel like a deer in headlights. Like people will see how awkward I am and judge me \n\n3) I do not think this happened to me but might have to other ppl\n\n4) I would say yes. I do not have some severe trauma, but every time something triggers my memories of being alone with no one to sit with at the lunch table or no one to play with during recess, I regress to my former self even though I finished school 8 years ago (I was at my worst during grades 4-11). All moments that trigger these memories are anxiety inducing and make me want to be alone and cry \n\n5) n/a for me \n\n6) this has happened to me before when I was directly attacked (in a verbal way).  My classmates were frightened when they saw that side of me lol\n\n7) not sure. Just that I freeze up when the subject is something I am embarrassed or ashamed to share (which is pretty much everything because I feel that whatever I say, I will be judged for it by someone)\n\n8) Yes to this. There are also plenty of times I just do not want to talk though, cuz I feel my safest in my comfort zone by not talking No need to apologize, I am a writer so I completely understand the worry that comes with portraying a character with such a different life experience than your own.", "How do I get a drivers license when I have sm?

If you did not speak, you would not get points. I told myself I could do it. I have to do it, for my grade. I have been preparing since last week. I had questions ready and everything.\n\nI could not fucking do it. I tried, but I could not. Even when someone asked a question I had an answer to, I just could not open my mouth. My heart was beating so fast and I felt like I was going to have a heart attack right there. \n\nI always work hard in school, do my homework, study, get good grades, but because I cannot speak in front of people, my grade will go down. And there is nothing I can do about it. I know nobody cares but I am just really upset right now and feel like a complete failure :( I felt like this was the only place I could rant I am do not suffer from selective mutism, but as someone with severe anxiety who had to do one last year: I feel your pain. \nIs there any chance you can talk to your English teacher? Maybe even see if you can write everything you wanted to say down and give it to her? \nI know it is hard but make sure she knows you are trying. \nShe more than likely will be willing to work with you. I wish the best. i feel you on this :( i fucking hated socratic seminars and i was never able to participate even once and it was so hard to just talk openly without raising my hand/getting called on because i was too scared of getting talked over/making an idiot out of myself/accidentally creating another debate in which i would have to talk more. i would know all the material super well but it never mattered anyway if i couldnt participate in the seminar. needless to say i was always graded poorly on those, but i just had to bite the bullet. \n\ncan we just ban socratic seminars from all curriculum I feel anxious just reading about your experience.  Can you talk to the teacher about earning the grade another way?  Tell them you have SM and perhaps have an opportunity to do the assignment in a smaller group?  Maybe with just 1 or 2 other people?  If she gives you this opportunity and you do awesome, how would that make you feel? I do not know...my teacher is a really talkative person,. I do not think she would understand. Every time we do presentations and stuff she says things like \"Yes everyone is going to present. Get over it.\" I will just have to see how badly my grade suffers. If it is really bad, then maybe I will gain the courage to talk to her. I have had the same problems as you, and it is okay to be afraid. I say you talk to your English teacher, and if you are not comfortable then maybe a guidance counselor? Your grade should not suffer for things that are out of your control. What I used to do is hand some writing separately or do the discussion after school with just the teacher. I am a parent of grade school kids with SM. I asked their school for a 504 which is a plan for your teachers to follow to help them.  My kids' teachers do not force them to talk and are helping us with treatment. Your case may be different, but perhaps you can get your parents to do a similar thing. If you cannot talk to her or write it down, how about sending her an email? You could also link some articles about SM in the email. That way she will have a good understanding of it. Hey, I have had a similar problem too, for a long time. I am currently a graduate student in lots of seminars in which I have to talk. Here is what I have done to cope with it for years: write out exactly what you want to say (for me, writing is much easier than speaking). Sounds like you already did that, at least a little bit, and good job! Sometimes, of course, you cannot control the discussion toward things you want to say, so, just try to make yourself scribble something down to say while people are talking. If all else fails, it looks like you are busily taking notes on the discussion and suitably engaged. \n\nThen, because there is so much pressure to open your mouth and start talking, especially in the middle of a discussion, I try to put the pressure off of that. I either (a) raise my hand or, on a great day, (b) say just one word (as if I am about to start talking, they do not know the difference lol). That takes some of the pressure away from the whole, trying to break into the conversation thing. (I know the raising your hand thing can be discouraged in a socratic seminar, but whatever, they will live). \n\nWhen you just do that, someone will notice that you are trying to talk. And they will inevitably say \"Hey, _____ has something to say!\" Then, on a great day, you can look down at the page and try to read out what you wrote down. If it is a not so great day (as many can be), you can just shake your head when you are called on. Note the great feature of this strategy, the opt-out-at-any-time-ness. \n\nThis strategy helped me through my high school, my ivy league education, and now grad school. I hope it helps you too, if just to say a word or two and back out. That can feel huge. Wow, that sucks. I am sorry. No one should have to go through that. Just remind yourself that you have SM which makes it very difficult for you to talk. Iv'e been in the same situation and it filled me with self hatred for not following instructions and getting a poor grade. And I do not want the same thing to happen to other people. It is not your fault. There should really be more awareness about Selective Mutism. Things like this should not happen. Period Hi sorry, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68", "does anyone have any general advice about how to live with selective mutism when there are very few people you can talk to?  Two words. Online friends. Sounds weird, but using the internet to make friends totally changed my life lol. Before it, I was painfully lonely thanks to my SM, but the internet gave me a place to make friends where I was not being held back by SM. I agree. I am really good at talking &amp; being myself in text. Actually met my SO thru online gaming after being friends for a few yrs. Being chatty to my classmates /posting on Facebook made people more interested into me back in highschool when all they saw me as was shy. They would even ask \"why are you shy irl but not online?\" Lol that is what my first 'boyfriend' in 7th grade asked me lol...\n\nHe first approached me, it was really sweet of him. He probably overheard me talking to my lunch friends that I am skipping lunch cuz of a stomachache. That afternoon he sent a text saying: \"how bad is the stomachache? I hope u feel better soon\" (translated - I still remember the exact words) That *never* happened w *anyone*, I stumbled with my phone all flushed for like 10 mins lol\n\n\n\nWe texted each other almost every day, usually starcraft related like - \"zergling rush! **\" - or \"can u help me w this math problem\" etc.\n\nThen came 8th grade and he stopped replying, I still remember I was the last one to text - \"oy why r u not replying?\". That was almost 15 years ago. I kind of miss him Same here! One of my online friendships has lasted 10-11 years now and we still talk every day. We have had some arguments/fights and blocked eachother because we were pissed, but eventually we always apologized to eachother and then everything was fine\ud83d\ude02 it is the longest friendship I have ever had (most only last 1-2 years, people start ghosting me when I start being open about my health, especially my mental health.. and now I am chronically ill on top of that, so I have lost most friends but idk how to gain more friends because, I mean.. I have some that I can talk to online, but I do not have any who live anywhere near me._.) \n\nAnd also, the fact that the friendship has lasted for an entire fucking decade makes me feel old AF\ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd I also just remembered that she also has SM\ud83d\ude02 maybe that is why the friendship lasted so long\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02 maybe I just need more friends with the same diagnose and same favorite band as me\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 making online friends seems like good advice but I was kind of thinking more like getting a job, getting by in college, doing everyday things that need to get done. Honestly, I am graduating this year and I am a little worried I just will not eat in college because I will not want to go to the cafeteria, let alone how I am going to manage going to class and stuff. Online friends do not help in day to day life. You are right about that, but having *some* kind of support system is more important than you would think. Without a support system, you are more prone to depression, which is why so many SMers end up with it.  As far as getting a job, there are some jobs that you might find a bit easier to do with SM.  Here is a list I put together: \n\nAnd regarding college, you will have to rely on emailing your teachers back and forth, and possibly think about telling them about your SM and what they should and should not do to help. Also think about asking for an alternative way to give presentations, such as presenting it 1 on 1 with a teacher, or recording it at home and showing it to them. \n\nTo manage eating, what I always did was bring myself a lunch, and then bring it to a quiet place with no people and eat it there. That was usually a bathroom stall for me which was not the best place to eat lol. In college there should be a lot more secluded places. \n\nBest of luck.", "Any other recovered SMers have their SM temporarily come back in some high stress/anxious moments? Just when I thought I was done with SM, I had a really stressful day, and ended up being unable to speak to people I was normally able to speak to. It seems to be a recurrent thing where when I get stressed it flares up, even though I recovered last year. It is a bit frustrating honestly, because I thought I could finally put my SM behind me.\n\nAnyone else experience this?", "Why cannot I talk to one side of my family? I grew up being raised by my Dads side and feel comfortable to be myself around them.   I would be taken to my mother\u2019s side every few months growing up but I always went silent around them. My mother\u2019s side of the family always bring out the worst in me.\nI am 21 years old now and for some reason THREE people from my Mum\u2019s family now live with us, because they have no home and are waiting to build a house, which is taking ages.   It is as if the universe wants to torture me like this. I cannot talk to my grandparents or aunts or uncles on my mum\u2019s side. it is not even this bad around strangers anymore - I am just awkward and do not care as much, but around one side of the family it is as if I have selective mutism again.  I cannot wait till they move out, but so far I am constantly stuck in lockdown WITH THEM \ud83d\ude2d\n\nWhy have I always been like this? That Is me with my extended family they stayed with us for 2 weeks and I could hardly look at them they just think im rude Same. I never talked to extended family. Saw them once a year but could never even play with my cousins when I was little even tho I wanted to I relate with you too, this resonated a lot with me. I can only really talk with my immediate family. When I had to go see my cousins, I could not utter a conversation at all. \n\nI think the main reason is that we do not really spend time with them. How can we talk to the other side of our family if we were never really with them, right? For instance, you were raised by your dad's side so that is how you grew to be comfortable with them. That is a great thing! I actually do not know if this is the answer you are looking for but it is also something I am trying to figure out.\n\nI only ever saw my cousins once a year for a week or two. It sucks because my cousins are so nice and I really want to be myself and talk with them but I let them do the talking and I usually follow up with nods and some phrases. Wow did not think I would see anyone with a similar experience. I grew up this way \u2014 super close with my dad\u2019s side but not at all with my mom\u2019s side despite seeing them frequently and my 20+ cousins on that side being close to each other. Now that we are all young adults, I am naturally excluded from the feelings of closeness and personal connection, and it is just general small talk. Smiling, waving, and nodding are my go to", "How would you describe what SM feels like?  My brain has a marble enclosure Suffocating and loneliness I guess I will answer my own question.\n\nFor me, no matter how badly I want to say something, and no matter how hard I try, the words just do not come out. They get \u201cstuck\u201d. It feels like there is a lump in my throat preventing me from speaking. I can hear the words in my head, but they just do not come down to my mouth. overwhelmed, extremely anxious, hyper-analyzing yet completely exhausted This is a really good description.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me it feels like a spell has been put on my vocal cords and facial muscles and I cannot move them. I feel frozen. I know the words I want to say, but I cannot will my body to make the sounds. Very small.", "Should I try to talk to my crush or should I write on a paper? I am an 18 year old guy and I have a crush on a cute girl who goes to my high school. We are not in the same class but I do have science class together with her once a week. She does not know me and she does not know I have selective mutism. Only my teachers know. I communicate with my teachers by writing on paper. I really want to talk to my crush but it seems nearly impossible for me because I have selective mutism and social anxiety. Should I try to cure my selective mutism first before I decide to talk to her? Or should I write on paper and give it to her and hope she actually writes a reply on it and gives it back to me? What if she ignores it? Maybe she will feel uncomfortable. She is a shy girl. It seems so risky. I need advice. So just a few thoughts as they come to me...\n\nFrom my experience, overcoming SM is a process. It may be a little ambitious to jump right in. But if you can, that is great!\n\nMy initial thought, though...SM is heavily associated with anxiety. Confronting your crush is a high-anxiety situation. You can certainly try, but do not set yourself up for disappoinment. My concern is that if you are close enough to recovery that you are willing (and the least bit confident) to actually attempt to speak to this girl, and you make that attempt and freeze, it could derail all of your progress. \n\nI am all for making progress. For most people it takes baby steps. A deep dive may work great for you, and that is a call only you can make. You know your situation and limitations better than anyone. \n\nEither way, just go for it. If she turns you down, at least you tried. If she does not accept your SM and does not care to attempt to accommodate, she is not worth the pain. And if you never at least try, you will spend way too much time wondering. If you can speak to her, do it. If not, write that note. Be transparent. See what happens.", "Helps for me and my partner So i have selective mutism which sometimes leaves me unable to speak for up to an hour. Well since one day where my partner was getting frustrated because i wasnt responding we found a way so now i can signal him (if i can touch him) to just give him 2 taps, so he knows. Thought i would mention this incase anyone else who has a partner or friend might not be able to tell them or say im having an episode. I am curious, you say your SM comes in \u201cepisodes\u201d?Selective mutism does not come in \u201cepisodes\u201d, but rather a consistent pattern of who, when, and where they cannot speak. The only time it may be episodic is when people with Sensory Processing Disorder or Autism go (involuntarily) mute during sensory overload because they are so overwhelmed, but this is different from SM. SM is an anxiety disorder. No my SM comes in states of of panic its how i shut down.  I have CPTSD and have been diagnosed, my SM stems from that. its not consistent like you think its a differrent kind. SM develops most common in childhood which is where mine comes from. it develops in certain situations, such as school, public places or for me and my case in moments where events happened. why i call them \"episodes\" because it didnt happen in school it happened while i was being abuse so all it takes for me to have my SM and an episode is to hear a song, word, or be touched the wrong way. I would be careful to say the only time as unless your a professional its not a good idea to sya when someone can experience or be experiencing SM. (im speaking as a child and youth care worker, and someone who has a diagnosis)", "Cannot speak when around one specific person. Is that SM? Well I was thinking about, if SM can come in affect, when one specific person is around. It is because of a thatcher i have since i am ten years old (now I am almost 17). In the early years on my school I was terrified of her. And now, even if I am quite a confident person, I cannot speak in her presence. I get really sweaty, get panic but I really cannot get a single word out.\n\nSo I did some research about how SM comes in affect. It is part of social anxiety, where the amygdala(part of the brain responsible for the recognition of danger and how to deal with it) considers social encounters as a threat. To fight this thread the amygdala applies actions that helped in the past. In case of SM, staying silent helped. So the amygdala blocks the function of the verbal cortex. Wich makes, in certain situations, someone with SM even more mute than someone with none working vocal cords (:\n\nSo my conclusion is that SM can come in effect  when encountering one specific person.\n\nIf i am wrong with my definition please correct me. What are your thoughts on this? Any options appreciated. I am relatively new to SM and not diagnosed, and I cannot really answer right or wrong, but I feel like what you are saying makes sense. I have not thinking about if it would just be around one person, but if it may be in certain situations. That is been my issue, first of I tend to show SM signs around my mother mostly, (which actually may resemble your problem in a way) then to other ppl depending on the amount of people or what the topic is. Like I can talk to my dad about everything from space to specific cat facts, but when it comes to feelings or a simple \"how are you doing? \" it is just a no go. Or like, I would love to be engaging with my nephew, but since there is always other ppl around I can basically only smile at him. I freeze up.  Even tho the other ppl are family.\nBut I guess, if SM tends to be around specific people, like act normal home, sm at school or the other way around, it would make sense that wit could be around just one person. Tho I have been questioning sm for me just bc I seem to have the reversed kind. I can be active around mates in school but quiet at home. But I am pretty sure that is still a thing. So why not. Not too sure about the social anxiety part. I have read here:   that \"The cause, or causes, are unknown. Most experts believe that children with the condition inherit a tendency to be anxious and inhibited. Most children with selective mutism have some form of extreme social fear (phobia).\" That does not necessarily specify social anxiety, just anxiety. Where did you read that? I kind of want to read that myself. It sounds really interesting! It is a summary of the stuff you can read on the websites, you get adviced to visit upon entering the subreddit. I do not know wich one though. Oh okay, thanks! sorry that I am replying so late but since it is a very specific situation and because of one person i do not think it could be considered selective mutism honestly, but that the way it happens with the brain is similar? the anxiety making you unable to speak. anxiety from a social interaction with one person is not the same as having social anxiety though, unless u mean you have that anxiety with other people too. but since selective mutism is a consistent failure to speak in multiple settings it does not seem like the same thing at all really, selective mutism usually affects life and ability to function in public a lot and is usually (but not always im sure!) present at a really young age. (I showed symptoms when I was 5 or less) I do not think it would be just one person at all. that is not a specific social setting/situation but more of an issue with that person.. it seems like a very personal specific thing for you? of course if it is serious and affecting your life then talk to a dr or therapist about that! only if you will have to talk to her though idk if that is the case. but still I really hope you can recover and deal with that \u2764\ufe0f Thanks for your reply. It was quite interesting to read. You gave me a lot to think about. But i think visiting a therapist is not necessary cause it is (mostly) a thing around that teacher and she was recently assigned to a new class so i do not have to interact with her that much anymore. As for your idea that it is something similar to social anxiety resulting in an SM like effect, might describe it pretty good.", "Does anyone else go almost completely mute for a day or two around people you could previously talk to normally on really high anxiety days? the only people I can physically talk to are my close friends (sometimes I struggle around them) and family. But when my anxiety is super bad I am unable to talk to anyone normally, I cannot even whisper so I rely on hand gestures and text hey! what id suggest is to brave it and try to talk,  as a person with selective mutism myself I know that is it is beyond hard, but if you have it or starting to get it then it would be best to start talking more so that hopefully, you do not get selective mutism. Here is a quote that might help you: \\`become comfortable with the uncomfortable\\` -Hope this helps u :) I try to talk but very often I physically cannot, no words come out when I open my mouth to speak. it is beyond frustrating. When I rarely can force myself it is really painful and severely anxiety inducing :(\n\n\nIt is a daily struggle at this point especially at school where I am expected to speak (+ has social anxiety) but cannot\u2026which unfortunately has taken a toll on my grades since I cannot verbally ask the teacher for help\u2026\n\n\nI appreciate your help though Its okay! :) \n\nI know exactly how you feel and it must be so terribly hard for you especially as it affects your daily life! \n\nSo what I suggest is to tell a trusted adult like your mum/dad or even a teacher, if you do not feel confident because I know it must be really hard to tell someone then perhaps write a note about what your experiencing right now and give it to them. \n\nIf still your unable to do this then maybe try write a note to your friends and write answer cards like yes or no etc that you can show when someone asks you something you cant nod to. \n\nBut trust me because speaking to an adult or even a friend really does help! The weight will be lifted and hopefully you will get the help you need. \n\nIf your struggling with anxiety try a helpline for example childline or shout. Depending what country you live in these may not exist if this is so then type help hotline text numbers or look on websites about anxiety help. Hopefully you will get sorted :) I hope this has helped a little!", "SM related painting I did yesterday ", "Is this actually relatable? I thought I was the only one.  Definitely not the only one who is terrified of that happening. Not the only one. oh no i feel this too", "Do I have selective mutism? TLDR: Always been mute and socially anxious outside family. Always been talkative and rarely nervous around family. Do I have selective mutism?\n\nThis may be a little rambly, so sorry. \n\nBack in elementary school, I never really spoke. In fact, one of my earliest memories was when I was 4 and I was hiding behind my father when he tried to drop me off from school. I always felt nervous talking to people outside my family. Back in Pre-K, I even had trouble asking to use the bathroom and that led to some....accidents.\n\nI was always known as the \"quiet kid\" or \"shy kid\". People always asked me, \"why are you so quiet?\" I also got \"You should talk more\" a lot.\n\nWhile some teachers treated it with praise (\"Why cannot you be as quiet as xxx? He is such a good student\"), it was sometimes a liability. I would get lower participation grades because I was too nervous to talk. I sometimes got bullied because I was shy. \n\nThe trend continued into middle school (without the bullying), where I was still known as the \"quiet kid\". My art teacher even wrote in my yearbook that I had \"quiet energy\".\n\nAt that time, I realized that I did not know how to make friends. I kind of grown accustomed to being by myself so I did not really develop any social skills. \n\nI always felt nervous approaching people and I could not really maintain conversations. I was also afraid of showing emotions. I sometimes even ignored people who approached me out of anxiety. \n\nNow I am at high school, and I still have some of the issues I mentioned before. If there is one positive, I am not really known as the \"quiet kid\" anymore since I go to a school that is 3 TIMES as large school than before. \n\nBut I still feel nervous talking to people and I have trouble maintaining conversations. I have gotten better, but I am still feel a bit \"socially backwards\" compared to the rest of my peers. It does not help that I have a stutter and a quiet voice.\n\nBut in my family, it always been the exact opposite. I am much more talkative and joke around a lot more. And while I do not share everything with my family, I am a lot more open.\n\nSo anyway, do I have selective mutism?", "How do I deal with the fact that my SM hinders me from getting a girlfriend? I am 16F and I am diagnosed with selective mutism and apraxia of speech. SM has hindered me in a lot of things in life, but I learned to accept it. But one thing I cannot seem to accept is the fact SM is stopping me from getting the one thing I want in life: \na girlfriend. \n\nI understand theres more to life than getting into a relationship, but as someone who does not really have anyone close, getting a girlfriend is the main thing I want out of life. The problem is, girls tend to be attracted to confidence which I obviously do not have. People also say personality matters most, which makes me feel worse because I have a hard time showing my true personality cause my SM covers it. I try to be positive and hopeful about things, telling myself I just have to be patient, but it is getting hard to wait. What Is worse is that I tend to fall for confident girls which I have no chance with. \n\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated, thanks! Yep, the girl that caught my heart was this confident ass girl. She came up to my family and I in my Target's parking lot, and she was talking about my car and how she had the same one...of course I cannot talk to her. But she is really pretty and into the same shit, so that just makes her that much more to me. It made me realize that I want that in my life, even though I thought I just permanently swore that off....that was in the summer, but time passed and even though my mom got her number, what was I supposed to do?\n\nI am funny, but at the same time the only person that knows anywhere close to the true me, is me. I cannot express myself to anyone....and I also can not enjoy regular life because to me regular life is not comprehensible...it was only after I met this girl, that that life felt like it was attainable, that I could actually have things that 'normal' people did. I was very euphoric.......I had the MOST MOTIVATION to want to speak in my entire life, made the most progress too, in about a month's span. But time past and I lost motivation because it seemed like that hair of possibility was gone. So now about 1 month out from that day I met that girl, it is almost gone....July 31st and I am just disappointed I could not fully speak by then...and I know that is optimistic (I am 18 and this is my entire life, so far).\n\nNow fast forward and in August my family gets COVID, so we stay inside and do not do much and from that month on I have regressed back to where I was, although I directed my mom to switch my college because I HATED my college I was at, I could not picture doing that. So now I take normal classes. As stupid as it was I wanted to try to go to this girl's college, because I figure oh...she will see my car, and when I am alone I will be able to do actually say something, but I do not end up going to that college, and I know that is stupid but ey.....\n\nThe summer was great though and it showed me what I do want in my ideal life, and I miss it, I miss it a fuck ton. And that day that I met that girl, it was the most random day...it was actually the first time I ever managed to stay up 24hours straight, and it was for no good rason (2am to 2am).....I was watching 9/11 videos that morning, and ended meeting the absolute perfect girl, that night.\n\nI went from going about my life, not wanting change ever (not caring at least for it).....and then wanting it so fucking bad. Now I am back to that before state and doing the same things once again, and I have lost touch of that want and that motivation, but I KNOW it was there, and I kind of recall what it was like, but time's past....the only thing or re-kindling I have towards that time is the fact that I wrote everyday (although somedays I am fucking lazy and do not write anything, so I missed a few)...so yeah. Where I am at now, is I am just going on in life......but I have no goals, I guess I have hope to one day have goals......then in the summer, it was this girl, have a family....in a perfect world...but I am so far from that it is insane.\n\nI am dependent, and if I lived on my own my OCD would be the death of me....let alone my talking ability or inability. I just do not know anymore, it is like life sucks...but also at the same time I do not think death is a good answer because death does not a real thing for me, it feels like it only applies to any one but me.....and I also hate my self-image although I do not think I am ugly...but I do not actively shop for my own clothes, and wear the same few outfits (which same outfit, different color)......and my hair cannot be styled because of Alopecia Arrieta (partial hair loss which is cover-able with a decent amount of hair) and I never would because that is diffferent...and me being different makes me feel self-conscious in doing so...\n\nThere is more but I just cannot think of it. I do not understand it either, because I push people away before you would get to me....and I am not in a setting where I can even meet people (online school)....or why someone would want to be with someone like me to begin with......I also feel isolated even within SM people, I feel like I cannot relate to everyone here. Though they get it, I guess.\n\nEdit: And that was good to write, it is definitely been on my mind. And these days I just listen to Juice WRLD on repeat since I find relatability in that...a lot of his unreleased music too, I will just make custom albums to it. It is something, and college I have not put a lot of effort into and am behind on a lot of stuff...I just find it very meaningless.  As much as it would be great to have someone right now, forcing something would not make it good.\n\nWell, i have recovered from SM through a lot of work and effort, but i sometimes get really nervous especially before first dates and similiar stuff. This is normal and this is okay. \n\nBut lemme tell you this, it gets easier. With age you will probably get more confident in yourself and you will attract people to you. Perhaps you will find love then.\n\nAlso, do not make another person responsible for your happiness, that creates an unhealthy relationship. Focus on yourself for some time, search a new hobby that you can socialize, some yoga, some meditation, or try some workouts at home. I recently started climbing and met some cool people through this! The key thing is getting out there and starting to interact with people. Even if its just a friendly hello or a nice little compliments. Set goals qnd do small steps towards it! \n\nAnd, if it makes you feel better: I got my first gf when I was 17, close to 18. Life is not a race and do not jump into a relationship just because the opportunity arises. Try not to compare yourself to others. Take your time. Clearly you can write. Perhaps develop the relationship over text, messaging or email. Do not divulge everything right away. Ask her about her life, interest etc. Talk about your hobbies, interests etc. Just work on building a friendship first, then explain. \n\nI have never been diagnosed with SM but I suspect that is due to my age (42). However, when I am comfortable with people it is not an issue at all. Yet in certain situations it is crippling. \n\nThis girl is just the first person to spark your interest. It is easy to focus all your attention into one person. But it may not work out, prepare yourself for this possiblity. Much of what you said really hit close. Thanks for sharing, it really makes me feel less alone. I am also a writer, though I have not been writing lately because of laziness mixed with school work. Also I know how much ranting about problems helps. If you ever want to just rant or talk feel free to DM me, I am always open to hear people\u2019s problems. Thanks :) It is nice to hear positive stories from people with SM. Hope i was of some help!\n\nSM is a pretty depressing disorder to have in your backpack, I always encourage people to try and jump over their shadows. It is possible, but just really really hard. You can do it. Just take one step at a time :) SM does make it extremely hard to get into a relationship, but it is not impossible. \n\nAt your age, it really does feel like everyone around you is dating and you are the only one being left out, but it does not mean you are not capable of having a relationship. Hell, my current girlfriend is my first actual relationship and I started dating her at 22. \n\nDo not try to force a relationship by dating random people as that will cause you more anxiety (and trigger your mutism). It is best to just wait and allow a relationship to fall into your hands...strangely enough, life works like that.\n\nMaking friends online is what got me the support I needed and the relationship I craved. Find people that will accept you even if you can only talk in text during a voice chat.", "why are people with selective mutism still forced into oral presentations? hi everyone :) first time posting on reddit so forgive me for any mistakes. next year i (F15) will be going into my final years of schooling. english is required at my school but i chose to do english language thinking it would have less oral presentations because i have selective mutism. this is not the case unfortunately as there must be an oral component in each english.\n\nthat was just some background information. the real problem is that I have an upcoming oral presentation this year, and it has to be online given the current covid situation. the thing is, i physically cannot talk online. it is hard enough pressing the unmute button let alone deliver a three minute speech. my teacher is very understanding and emailed me to ask what I would like to do. obviously i said i would just like to submit the written one but that i Understood this might not be possible so an alternative would be a pre-recording. i also have a stutter which becomes severe when i am nervous so this option would help me perfect my speech. however, apparently these cannot be done in the final years and so they suggested I present just to them. i have no doubt my teacher would be understanding but this is majorly stressing me out. \n\nso my question is, why are people with selective mutism still forced into oral presentations? it is a severe form of anxiety, and trust me if i could talk i would but it is like my throat closes up. i also feel like i should add that i am currently undergoing the process of being diagnosed with autism. so does anyone have any advice on what to do? I am giving a speech in two weeks, and pre-recording was my solution. I am also autistic by the way. exactly, pre-recording is a much better option and i do not see why i cannot use it in the future. i get that my teacher wants to prepare me for year 11 &amp; 12 which is why theyre suggesting i present to them but i just do not think i am ready yet My speech is a professional lecture for a few dozen/hundred college professors. Level does not affect accommodations. I did prerecording a bit as a middle school/high school kid (in the early 2000s) and it would sometimes work. Most of the time they forced me to try and present in person, which caused even more trauma that I am now unpacking at 30 years old. I believe this to be the biggest cause of my selective mutism, because I was nonverbal and then it became an even huger problem. I majored in Spanish and went mute on the second slide of my senior presentation. It was horrific. I somehow still graduated with honors though, so it just shows how useless presentations can be. ahh i see and you are right, that makes sense. i have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow so i will see if they can back me up on this one so i can pre record. ty for ur advice :) it is so dumb how they forced you to undergo all of that i am sorry :(( honestly though i feel the same, the more they try to force me to talk, the worse I get :/ at the beginning of the year it was great because i was freshly diagnosed so no one forced me to talk but now it seems like they think i have \u201crecovered\u201d but i have not in the slightest. good job on ur honours though : D agreed, the verbal component shows next to nothing so it is stupid how they try to get us to do it still. especially with speeches since you can literally just memorise a script so theres no difference of just sending through the script and being exempted from the oral part :( Idk, but SM has shown me that as 'accepting' as this world claims to be, it is still pretty combative of shit it has no concept of.\n\nMy Mom had a 504 plan with my Highschool, but idk specifics....I think she wanted an IEP for me too, but the school did not want to do it, idk (I did not really know too much about that stuff).\n\nEdit: THE ONLY time I ever presented in MS/HS....I could in Elementary school (or at least I did)....back in Elementary school I thought I just found talking unecessary, I did not carry this notion with me of being SM, or anyone thinking of me that way. I would also read out loud in class if I was picked. That only stopped in MS. I wish it never did, though there were things with SM even back then, but it was much better than currently at 18 and in my 2nd year of college now. Which in College I did do one video type thing (edited it and read a script I made), but I could do that with the knowledge I barely knew this teacher and my Mom would not see the video ever.\n\nSo back the only time I presented in Middleschool, well like the rest it was to a teacher that held no expectation over me and this is 7th grade (before my SM was really socially established in my schooling days...or at least self-ingrained, that being my image)......so I get up in this health class and since this teacher scares me, I say my line in the script which is like one word. No one remembers it, my friends do not, and I told my parents about it a few years ago.....(though they are not people I talk to). All of this sounds dumb thinking about it, but that is what it all is.\n\nEdit2: I wish I could go back to 2013 and back to the start of 6th grade...that was my path-point of becoming worse and really developing my underlying SM, or never seriously developing it and growing past it. I definitely blame it on my parent's parenting style....if I am a parent there is a TON I am doing differently, I am not going to be hand-holdy because I feel like that is what screwed me the most...there was never a chance for me to let go of my parents or to ruin their \"perfect image\" of me. I still am not my own person, I still live in fear of ruining that image and running my own life. I hope they let you do a pre-recording as that is more feasible. I do not know the reason why either as most people do not even pay attention to the oral presentations. They probably want to see the output one gets from the class and see how one performs orally. \n\n*Brief anecdote* \\- (No I am not diagnosed, but I highly suspect that I have selective mutism). I believe it was really severe in my younger years, but it is possibly mild intensity for me now. On terrible days I could go days/long hours without talking because of how anxious school situations are. (sorry this is getting long, I tried to cut it up into paragraphs)\n\nActually yesterday I had to give a presentation live because I did not want to cause conflict within my group. One of my group members said something like, \"It is so weird to have your voice play and we are just going to be sitting there. We should do it live. This is college, people need to suck it up.\" It made me want to cry. I just nodded to everything and so that is how I *had* to present in real-time. I kept trying to prep myself mentally. I mumbled a bit but it helped to think that no one will really care about my performance. After that, I could not say anything at all. It is as if I had captured a window of opportunity for a brief moment. \n\nI despised oral presentations so much they gave me so many during my 2nd year of high school. I guess it kind of helped that they did but not really... often times I would rely on my group members to do the talking for me (if it was a group work thing). \n\nI wish I could help you somehow. I understand how hard it is to talk when you really want to but nothing comes out. Maybe some advice is to practice breathing skills and think of a very calm scenery that makes you comfortable. I try to picture these things, oftentimes it helps but it may not work for everyone. Just remember you are doing the best you can, best of luck! The thing with stuff like this is that making one exception means that others want an exception too. If you were to get an doctors certificate that claims that you cannot do this due to stress/anxiety, then a lot of other people would find a way to get these too and that would be unfair too, because it puts the ones actually doing it at an disadvantage.\n\nThis also would mean that comparison is no longer a good option, which would lead into problems further down the line. It sucks, I know, but there are reasons why such exceptions are to come by. Life is not easy, for some its harder, for some its easier. SM is a hard mode option, which we did not choose. However its still possible to overcome, though it needs a lot of work, patience and time.\n\nBy letting you skip the presentation, you will be skipping essential experience in talking to and with other persons. Communication is one of the most essential skills a social human being can have. The rule is not there to bring suffering, but to enable learning. If it were optional to do this presentation, almost no one would do it.\n\nIt is great that your teacher has been offering you to prerecord it.  \nIt will be tough, but I am sure you can do it. I overcame it too.\n\nMy advice would be to pull through and try your best. No one is going to hurt you, the only thing that could happen is that you will grow as a person.\n\nThere are many ways to prep for this, when you do it early enough, I am sure you will find a method/way to make it manageable. I got to give my oral presentation via text to speech with the maximum (50% extra time.) i guess it was the best they could offer me under the circumstances besides an exemption but when considering speech speed versus typing speed, even with the extra time it still meant i could only say about half as someone could speaking. fucked my grade over a bit which really sucks (and they were downvoted at least once) great response. it is kind of annoying how some schools (like mine) preach acceptance and then do stuff like this :/ funny story actually, in a year level assembly they showed someone with sm and were all like \u201cthis is the type of student we want to help grow\u201d but in reality\u2026 yeah :D also yeah i feel like parenting style can either screw someone over or help them, my parents used to be like yours and only cared about reputation but thankfully they have come around. i am sorry though :(( that is also the thing though, people do not get it, like to them saying a couple of words in a presentation is nothing but for us it is literal torture :/ especially online, it is unlikely anyone is going to be paying attention. also screw the group member who said that, seriously what the hell\u2026 it is college, yes, meaning you are all grown ups who should be understanding that we each have our own challenges?? it is really hard in those situations, because you are trying to talk yourself down from being scared but your heart is beating fast and all of that :( it is like your mind is saying one thing but your body is doing the opposite. i feel like they give oral presentations to help people develop the skills they might need later in life, but i am simply not up to that step yet and will develop it later during my occupational therapy sessions so i do not see the problem T-T thank you for the advice! i will definitely try the breathing techniques :)) that was actually an idea i was thinking of doing! the only thing is that i do not yet have a text to speech device D: i am a fast typer and can touch type so i could make eye contact still. that is so unfair they marked you down for that though :/  yes actually, i did think of the whole comparison problem. i want to get an english award this year as i currently have an average of 95.2% however i assume i would no longer be eligible for it if i had an adjusted assessment task which sucks, but i get it. i love that way of thinking though (the whole living on hard mode thing)! it is definitely able to be overcome but it will require a ton of work, which I am slowly doing. I do not want to skip the presentation as that would just be unfair, agreed. I just want to be able to do a recording instead of direct presentation (given it is online and this makes it more difficult). I understand they are trying to prepare me for the future but I do not think i am ready for a step that big yet, and I will continue to work towards this in occupational therapy so that I have the public speaking skills I need eventually. congratulations on overcoming it yourself though! it is not easy so that is quite the achievement :)) Exposure therapy? Thank you! \nI love your reflectiveness, you can be very proud of yourself!\nTrust me, it gets easier with age (currently 23).just always work on yourself and you will make it big!\nIm sure if you concince them that you recorded it in one take, that they can get something to work!\nPerhaps record it regardless, even if they do not allow you to, that way you practice and can listen to yourself talking. It gets easier when you can mentally prepare, but try to not think too much about it. Overthinking makes it worse. Easier said than done, but baby steps are the way to go! :) I did not have a TTS device - I had a laptop with Word and \"read aloud\" and after every sentence I had to select all the text I would written (Ctrl A), I had the mouse key hovering above the read aloud button, so I would then slap the mouse to make it read aloud, delete the text, then start a new sentence. I think I am relatively fast at typing - 80WPM odd - and I can touch type. Was probably a bit slower considering I had to do that method above after every sentence. But considering the speed of that presentation they wanted was probably somewhere more around 180WPM aloud, it was just no match typing It is not unfair, that is fucking bullshit. Is it good experience, yes. i know right! i was shook she had said something like that, i would hope more people to be understanding. yes the fight-or-flight or freeze moment I do not like it when my body responds in that way. but it also means that it is a natural response your body is going through or something sorry I am not a professional. i keep reminding myself that it is temporary but not knowing when it will end.\n\nalso yeah since it will be online most cases, not a lot will pay attention. however, maybe you can use this to your advantage. that because no one will pay attention, you can do what you have to do. breathing helps for sure since most times we are holding our breath tight because we are anxious.\n\nI believe in you! best of luck! I do not know. If you get a 504 you do not have to.", "Should I return to regular school next year?  Hey I suck at making life decisions so i am asking here if you read all of this I really appreciate you:\n\nI am a highschool freshman. At the beginning of the year I went to highschool like normal. I have always hated school mostly because I cannot talk to anyone and I am constantly anxious. I probably go to the biggest highschool in my state so that does not help my anxiety being around thousands of kids I cannot talk to. But even though I constantly felt uncomfortable and hated it I dealt with it.\n\nWelp second semester that changed. I was just done with everything and basically gave up and could not handle it anymore. I was feeling more sad and less motivated. My therapist put me on some anxiety meds but they gave me frequent panic attacks for the first time in my life. For example I was at a concert with my dad and had to leave early because I was having a panic attack and crying right in the middle of it (i am not on that medication anymore.)\n\nThis medication led to me missing 2 weeks of school. I never wanted to go back. The school therapist told me there was this program where I would go to this class for 2 hours every week day and do this online school on the computer. I was forced into that so here I am now.\n\nI have the option to go to school next year or do that program and I have no clue what to do. The program is so boring and I have still been pretty anxious and depressed. I also feel like i am getting dumber by using it.\n\nI am thinking about going back to regular school but no clue why. I just want to have friends and maybe a bf/gf like a regular person but I know that will not happen if I go back to school. I cannot talk to ANYONE. I do not even have online friends because I suck at communicating. \n\nI was thinking about maybe going to a new school but that would be just as bad and maybe worse. It would be full of people i have never seen before. At least if I went back to my current school there would be a sense of familiarity. \n\nUgh idk i am lowkey suicidal but would not go through with actually doing it. I should probably posting this on r/depression but it all leads back to my selective mutism in some way. Are there any special education schools where you live? They should have a lot less students, and teachers might be able to help you with your SM.\n\nWhen I went to high school, I went to a special school, and while it was far from perfect, and had zero positive effect on life outside school, I do not think I would have survived on a regular high school. I do not know exactly what you are going through and what struggles you are facing, but I went through a lot of the things you stated. Some of this might be triggering (self-harm and just general mistreatment), so proceed with caution.\n\nThe first 2 years of high school with SM and severe anxiety were the worst part of my life. I was so horrifically anxious and suicidal that I stopped trying. No one understood me and everyone in my life gave up on me. I ended up sitting in class 8 hours a day for a year or so doing nothing but folding origami and tearing paper. There were times where I would scrape and scrape at my skin right in front of the teacher hoping I would bleed to death. The response was apathy.\n\nThere were times where I refused to go to school and police officers would come into my bedroom and take me there themselves and physically drag me from class to class. It was cruel, dehumanizing, and invasive. If I learned anything at this school, it was that my life was not my own. I was just an object to everyone else. Something to be neglected most of the time and moved or berated if I got in the way. I still question whether or not I am human. I do not know if I am a monster or if the people who hurt me are.\n\nI do not know whether your situation is any worse or better, but going to school every day when it is a source of anxiety and suicidality is just not healthy. If you have an anxiety disorder, there is no just pushing through. Anxiety does not go away on it is own. In fact anxiety disorders tend to be self-reinforcing and get worse over time.\n\nThis program that allows you to go to less school might be a good temporary solution. You can take that extra time during the day to figure out what you want to do next and if you want to go back or change schools or what.\n\nI can share what my solution was. After my second year of high school my parents sent me to residential treatment after it was recommended in a neuropsych evaluation. It completely changed my life for the better and also gave me to tools to beat my SM and the worst of the anxiety.\n\nI do not know if you are seeing a therapist now, but maybe you should seriously consider some more intensive therapy if anxiety is having a serious impact on your life. Residential or outpatient treatment might both be options if you have parents with the means to pay for it. Treatment programs can be a great oppurtunity to learn new skills for dealing with anxiety. I found the CBT and exposure therapy at the program I was at extremely helpful.\n\nIf that is not in the cards, changing schools might actually be a really good thing. I went to a boarding school with about 25 students after treatment. It was a much healthier environment compared to a large and chaotic public school and I got the support and compassion I so desperately needed.\n\nI am sorry school has been so difficult. I would encourage you to keep reaching out for help, even if it is just through Reddit posts. SM can be incredibly isolating and lonely, but do not give up on yourself. Things can only change if you keep trying. regular school !! i have been surviving regular high school with sm and every year is always better than the last. i had to go online school from missing too many days in middle school in the middle of the school year and it was extremely isolating and the worst time of my life. going to school now makes me feel better than if i was to stay home", "Has anyone tried online counseling before? I have heard of online counseling services that give you the option to have text-based counseling with licensed counselors whenever you want. Has anyone ever had experience or interest in trying this kind of service? I think it has potential as an alternative for people who are too anxious to seek in-person counseling, especially like you guys who have trouble speaking. I have not tried it, but when I first got counseling I ended up using a website where I could reach out to a counselor. I started counseling by texting (on the website) them. I do not know if suicide hotline is counted as online counseling but imo it really did not help for me atleast. \n\nMight work for you but with my experience, it was not helpful.", "Was anyone else ever called, \"anti-social\"? I remember back in my school days where, I was called anti-social by my teachers.\n\nA kid would ask me why I did not speak and, the teacher would tell them that I was anti-social.\n\nAs a kid, I had no clue what that meant. It did not take me long to do a Google search and find out that, its actually another word for a sociopath.\n\nI was confused as to why I was being called one. It turns out that many people do not seem to understand that the word, anti-social and, use it wrong. In my case, people seem to think that it means \"a person who just does not want to talk\". When that is not even close.\n\nIt really makes me wonder as to how having selective mutism can be mistaken for antisocial behavior . They are very clearly different things. An anti-social person is a person who loves to cause harm and, feels no empathy.\n\n  \n\n\nPeople need to get educated on this. Yep, not very often, but a few times by friends or just people at school or whatever. Because I was always interested in psychology I knew early on what the actual definition was so it always irked me, especially because of the common thoughts that people with aspergers, or just mental disorders generally, are dangerous and uncompassionate people. Which is of course not only not true but emphatically the opposite, not only in my experience but as generally indicated by research on rates of abuse or violence involving the mentally unwell. \n\nThe proper term as I see it is *asocial*, in the same way as atheist or agender. I want everyone to be able to live happily and without dysfunction or suffering, as much or even more than the average person; I simply do not feel the same basic compulsion and need to socialize with others, and engaging in social activity is not something I generally seek out Constantly got called anti-social... When I was suffering with SM in my childhood I would alwayssss get called shy. I remember getting so mad! It was more than simple shyness, if someone is shy they are still likely going to talk at some point but that obviously was not the case for me. My friends would tell substitute teachers that I was \"shy\" when I did not verbally respond to them. They had good intentions but it put me in an even more difficult situation.\n\nI find anti social to be a harsh term and for a teacher to use it?!! I am sorry you have had to deal with that:( I was called asocial pretty often by other children, it even was kind of my nickname for years Yup, everyone just assumes you are an angsty teen that \u201chates everyone\u201d. No everyone just thought I was really shy, but a girl used to refer to me as \"la muda\" (the mute in spanish) like if I did not have a name Yes. I was frequently described as antisocial, shy, and even rude. No one ever bothered to ask why I did not speak, they just made assumptions about my character. I am not antisocial or shy, and we can all be rude sometimes, but I generally try not to be. I used to get called socially awkward \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude12", "12 year old me would be proud of current me i realized the other day that i have finally made all the progress i promised myself i would when i first got diagnosed. the idea of ordering my own coffee used to be galaxies out of reach, and now i do it without even thinking. i used to talk to a total of three adults in the world, and now i can talk to potential adopters of my foster dogs and answer their questions without trouble, even offering information without prompting. when i was young i swore that i would be able to talk by my senior year of high school because i knew that i was not going to let sm define my life. now, going into my senior year in a few weeks, i think i am going to be able to talk. point is: it gets better. it takes time and it really really sucks sometimes, but even when progress seems impossible, it gets better.\n\ntake care of yourselves &lt;3\n\n~ liv Isolation is something I am currently stuck in since the start of August. There is always a lack of motive to grow out of SM when I am because I see no point in coming out of the Isolation. Though I know if I do get out of it, then the motive will have reason to return to me...wanting to beat SM once again, so that gives me hope and peace. By 19 is the goal since I am 18 now. There has been no definitive progress made in August, but there was great progress in July, and great drive when I was very connected with my family, versus now where I am again very isolated from them. \n\nWhich I really did not put that 'lack of progress, pin-point' together until tonight. I aspire for the future because I know recovery is possible, it is just having the motivation for me.\n\nThis is kind of a rant, so it may be a little unrelated. I totally understand that. We are proud of you too :) that is amazing!! i am trying to support my 5 year old who was recently diagnosed with SM, any advice for a parenting support a child? I just looked at your name and realized you posted something about this a few days ago!!! than kyou! was just about to retype it lol. good luck with your kid!! :) Lucky, I tried ordering a coffee and ran out of line when it was almost my turn, I freaked out", "im young and i dont know how to deal with this :( hi there, i just discovered this sub and im so happy. im 13 and am 99.9% sure i have selective mutism. i am not officially diagnosed but the doctor said its a social anxiety disorder thing and the descriptions of selective mutism is exactly what i try to explain but i just dont know how. anyways, it has really been annoying for me at school. i always used to have social anxiety problems, but this has only recently been noticeable and worse around october. this has led people to thinking that im just a shy and quiet person, but that is not me at all. it feels like i have so many thoughts in my head i want to blurt out, and my brain just says no. it affected my grades on my report card (participation, initiative, etc). i do my work and i know the answers, but because of SM i dont volunteer as much as past years. even when im ready to present something to the class and i remember everything, i go up there and just freeze for about 10 seconds, and then it finally comes out and i can speak smoothly after that. does anyone have any coping mechanisms or ways to overcome this temporarily before i go to the psychologist? i dont know when the psychologist will contact me, the doctor just said he will speak to one. i told my family and my sisters seem to understand, but my parents seem to underestimate the seriousness of it. also, does anyone know if stress contributes to developing social problems? because a lot of things have been stressing me out lately. any replies are appreciated, even if it doesnt answer anything i said above since im not familiar with this. :( it also doesnt seem to happen if im not there in person, for example i spoke to my doctor on a phone call so it was just like talking to myself, i guess? I feel you. I definitely relate to having things you would want to say but physically you almost cannot. Sometimes it helps me to practice or think about what I might say when I am alone, before I get to a social situation. Also practicing with the people you are most comfortable with. And it is okay to be different :) Hope this helps.", "Do any other recovered SMs still struggle with saying \u201cimportant words\u201d? How do you deal with it? \u201cImportant words\u201d meaning things like \u201c(I am) sorry,\u201d \u201cit is fine/okay,\u201d \u201cthanks/thank you,\u201d \u201cexcuse me,\u201d \u201cyou are welcome/no problem,\u201d and so on. Whenever I have to say one of these, I panic for a split second before forcing it out. They just feel so strange in my mouth because I was never taught manners and I am not used to saying them and they have that extra \u201cthis is an important serious thing\u201d feel to them that just makes it scarier.\n\nJust a few days ago, someone apologized to me for something small and I panicked and said \u201cit is fine\u201d but I was completely unprepared to say it and my voice cracked and I wanted to sink into the floor when someone else jokingly pointed it out.\n\nI do not have any way to make it easier to say things like that, I just force myself to say it before it is too late and hope it does not sound as weird as it feels. I have taken to just humming \u201cmhm\u201d instead of saying \u201cyou are welcome\u201d or \u201cno problem\u201d because it is easier. Does anyone else feel this way? 100% \n\nIt happens to me alot.\n\nI also feel some kind of shame saying these words, I donno why but it adds more pressure. I never really had SM as in, I was always able to talk but I can only really answer to things if I am asked about 'facts'; like when someone asks me what I did at school or something, I can easily answer. But when someone asks me how it was at school, or asks a personal opinion, I always just say 'good' or 'yes' or 'idk', sometimes I just do not answer because I freeze. The \"important words\" that you point out is almost impossible for me; it seems to me that it is just very hard to say anything if it has requires an emotion. Absolutely. I find it so difficult to have important conversations, even now that I have recovered. Apologizing, even when I feel I really need to, is still difficult.\n\nI find that, for me at least, the problem becomes that I freeze up when I have something every specific I want to convey, but I feel as though I will not get to all of it, or it will not come across correctly. So, if that sounds familiar, I have come across a solution (sort of).\n\nIf there is something you need to say to someone, but its so important that you are paralyzed, write it down on a piece of paper and let them read it before continuing on, or text it to them (When I say \"write it down,\" I do not mean you should write it down with the expectation that you will read it to them when you have the conversation). Preface your message by saying something along the lines of, \"what I want to say is too important for me to speak, because I am afraid I will not be able to entirely convey what I really need to say to you. So instead, I am going to write/text it to you, that way I can think about what I am saying before it reaches you.\" You can also mention what you want to talk about generally, so that you do not worry them while you are typing what you are saying.\n\nI find its even better, and feels more genuine, if you do this in the same room as them. That way, you can write something/text them, and they can respond verbally if necessary, before you continue writing what else you want to say. There is no need for you to verbally talk when it comes to this.\n\nIt seems so silly, but its not silly. Do you know how many times I have watched movies screaming at the main characters to \"just communicate!!\" because they keep exclaiming that they are afraid to mess up what they want to say? It happens to a lot of people, and unfortunately this community is stuck with it a lot more often than most. But its not an impossible thing.\n\nI told my mom about this technique, and she is the most outgoing charismatic person to ever exist. She seemed excited by it, willing to both try it herself or be on the receiving end. People are willing to listen, and if they are not, then just make your statement and go knowing that you put in the effort to communicate with them regardless.\n\nI was diagnosed at a very young age, but I had such wonderful support in my life that I recovered really quickly. I was incredibly lucky, and I know that these things feel a lot bigger to most of the people in this community, but people will love you like they loved me, through it and with it and regardless of it. I have found that saying (or typing) these things in a half-joking manner's gotten me more used to them. If something still feels \"off,\" I will try to think of another way to say them. Still working on it, though. I experience the opposite, whenever I feel intimidated I could not say anything besides Im sorry or thank you. Oftentimes I dont mean it or it doesnt fit with the context. For example, I was having a bad day and when Id open the door for someone, I could only say thank you or sorry. I should try that \"just humming \u201cmhm\u201d, instead of saying anything. whenever i say \"youre welcome\" i sound so stiff and robotic, i also cant take compliments. i mean, its nice to be able to speak normally but those little moments really suck When I was SM I always had this issue as well as difficulty saying short words. Whenever I wanted to say short replies like good, okay, thank you, no, hi, etc. I always felt like something was blocking my throat, and on the rare occasions that I did speak it would come out all squeaky and awkward. Oddly enough, I sometimes found it a bit easier to whisper when trying to talk to people, but it still took a long time before I was comfortable talking. I would not say I am fully recovered, but I am much better than I used to be, and the answer is YES! I call them struggle words or heel phrases (I would jokingly refer to them as my Achilles heel of recovery and that ended up shortened to just heel phrases).\n\nThe absolute WORST of these for me is saying \"I love you\". It is likely been close to maybe a decade? about 8 years or so? since I have said \"I love you\" to a family member. That is not an exaggeration by any means, I honestly cannot remember the last time I said it to a family member. The closest I ever get to it is going \"mhm\" or nodding whenever my family says it to me. It is gotten to the point that my dad is the only one who still says it to me because everyone else knows it just makes me feel guilty because I not able to say \"I love you, too\" back. It makes me feel like an utterly shitty person and I hate it.\n\nOther phrases are asking questions in general, asking someone to repeat themselves, making definitive statements (like \"I want to go here\" or \"Let us do this\"), asking for help, stuff like that.\n\nEdit: Regarding things phrases like \"Thank you\", \"I am sorry\", etc. I find that I rely on them way too much, likely thanks to my general anxiety-ridden self but \"you are welcome\" is still hard for me and I usually resort to going \"mhm\" or \"of course\" or stuff like that. I cannot take compliments, and my brain registers being told \"thank you\" as a compliment for some reason. I relate with the questions and asking people to repeat themselves and definitive statements things. I cannot give a definite \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d unless I am joking, I always default to \u201csure,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d \u201cI guess,\u201d \u201cI do not know,\u201d \u201cnot really,\u201d \u201cehh,\u201d \u201ckind of,\u201d and so on. It is to the point where I had someone refuse to pay me back for something unless I gave an absolute \u201cyes\u201d to them asking if I wanted to be paid back, and I could not do it. I handle questions better, though. I just to frame it in a bit of a joking manner and force the words out before I can talk myself out of it. And when I do not hear what someone said, I tend to either just smile and nod and pray that was the right response or half-jokingly tell them I cannot hear them because straight-up asking them to repeat themselves is too stressful.\n\nStrangely enough, \u201cI love you\u201d is easier than half of these for me. I do not say it to my family, but that is entirely by choice because I do not have a great relationship with them. With friends, I default to \u201cily\u201d so I do not have to say it for \u201creal\u201d when I text them, but I can generally spell it out or say it when people ask me to. It still feels weird, but it is easier than giving definitive responses, haha.  I find it easier to say \"thank you\" to people I do not know than with those I know well like family and sometimes co-workers/supervisors. Apologizing has always been with about anyone. Also, if someone asked me how am I doing, then I either would not say anything or say \"good\"/\"fine\". Oh. I always resort to \"mm mm!\" and waving my hands to say \"you are welcome\" because I feel so silly saying it.. why is that!  But then I also feel silly after going mm mm since that would possibly seem rude.  \nWhy is it hard actually being polite with bigger words?? Wait... is that a problem for people with SM? I just assumed it was my ADHD. Judging by the replies, apparently. I associate it with my SM because, well, nothing like formerly being mute to make saying words hard, haha.", "Homework anxiety Does anyone here have homework anxiety ?\n\nI (17F) have homework anxiety (not very strong but I procrastinate a lot because of it) and I was wondering if it has something to do with selective mutism and social anxiety. I have always had it and never understood where it was coming from. I posted this because it was worse today and I noticed that a link became apparent between SA and homework. When I do my homework I inevitably think of school and I start feeling my heart racing and I start trembling, I am not being in control of myself anymore. This is exactly what happens every time I go to school. I am thinking about school and people who are there and it is almost as if I was there. When I look at the same books I used at school I feel this anxiety. I get some anxiety when I unpack my school stuff too. I fear everything that reminds me of the school environment. \n\nMy anxiety is not unbearable and it goes away when I appropriate the homework to myself and realize that I am at home, in a safe environment. When I start off I always get anxiety symptoms, especially when I have a complicated task to do because I know it will take me a long time. It is a mix between procrastination and anxiety I think.", "Can selective mutism cause a kid to be demanding I am trying to figure out the reason for this as a kid. I have an adhd diagnoses, ocd intrusive thoughts/hypochondria/had trichotrillonomia/tics/just right ocd, probably have anxiety/depression. And have innatentive adhd. I was diagnosed w selective mutism in preschool and my parents are narcisssits.\n \n\nI had a lot of anger towards my mom as a kid and remember following her around grocery stores angry and mumbling mean words to her under my breath. I also remember in elementary school she would take me shopping a lot. I for some reason would be very demanding and would feel panicked about getting what I want. I remember name calling and being very mean to get what I wanted in dressing rooms and almost having meltdowns. I think I genuinely felt panicked and was not acting to manipulate her. She did hate most things I liked but would always take me to my favorite stores like justice/abercrombie almost daily. I just remember constantly being panicked in dressing rooms to get something. It really sounds like spoiled brat behavior but I clearly had disorders that my mom refused to get me diagnosed as a kid like adhd that could have caused it. I just remember getting so angry at her over this Well, SM is an anxiety disorder and it sounds like associated anxious behaviors were nurtured by your parents (presumably  unintentionally). Many of your diagnoses can be associated with demanding behaviour, anger, fear and panic. One of the strongest urges anxiety creates is the need to control a situation. When we lose control, anxiety takes over and can manifest as anger, being demanding, tantrums, panic, fear, etc. It sounds like you were frequently overwhelmed with the feelings of anxiety and the need for control. Unconsciously, you probably knew that your mom had the control, so your anxiety manifested in being angry towards her and doing whatever you could to gain control of a given situation. ADHD is frequently diagnosed with anxiety. Remember, all these diagnoses are symptom-based meaning there is no blood test to \"prove\" ADHD or anxiety or depression or autism, etc. So, diagnoses can actually change from year to year based on how your symptoms change and how you present to the clinician. I always wondered what was wrong with my mom for never getting me help about stuff like this. She is mentioned thinking I had odd as a kid which I doubt. But like.. if your kids acting like this.. take them to the fucking doctor and get them treated. She says she does not like labels. I finally got an adhd diagnoses at age 20 and know I have the other disorders so I am going to see a therapist about them soon. But it just baffles me how a parent can legit just not help treat their kid at sll You said your mom is a narcissist. That is what is wrong with her. End of story. That is probably a huge contributor to your anxiety as well. It is hard to feel safe when the people responsible for your well-being only look out for themselves. This", "How do I talk less at home? My dad always gets mad at how much I talk and he is like \u201cwhy cannot you be like this at school?\u201d I really do not try to annoy him but I cannot help it. lol i do not think this is the right way to go around the issue", "Feel ready to talk to girls but do not know how to handle my reputation as the guy who does not talk I feel ready to take the next step and to talk to girls. Im 21. muscular and tall, probably a lil above average looks but no experience with women. I have always been known as this kid who never talks. I think women seem to be afraid or intimidated by me or something because I never talk and I possibly may be physically intimidating. How should I go about interacting with women? First, humans are super adaptable. Just as you can go from not talking to talking, other people can go from thinking of you as someone who does not talk to not thinking that. Do not worry about your reputation. It exists more in your own head than in other people\u2019s. It will not take long for people to adjust their expectations if you give them the chance. Yes, there might be a bit of surprise at first, but it will not last long. \n\nSecond, when you interact with women remember that they are people, not some different, special, creatures. You can interact with them in pretty much the same way you would with men. Women have complex inner lives, just like you do and just like other guys do. And women are all individuals. They are not a monolithic category. There are women out there who will enjoy talking with you and you can enjoy talking with. And there are women who will not be on your wavelength, but that is ok too. \n\nBut here are some general guidelines, if you are worried about being naturally intimidating. Respect their space. The way you position your body says a lot. But do not worry too much. Women are largely socialised to be good at picking up social cues. If your intention is to be friendly and not intimidating that will come across.\n\nBoth listen and have something to say. Try to find people who share interests with you, or who know a lot about something you might be interested in. Talk to them about those interests. Listen to what they have to say and ask lots of questions. Getting better at asking questions is a huge part of SM recovery, in my experience at least. But you can also do things to give you stuff to say. Being interested is interesting. \n\nThere is a online advice columnist called Dr Nerdlove, (the advice is good even if the name is not!) who I think might be helpful for you. Google him and take a look at his advice. Good luck! Thanks for the advice! And I will check him out.", "Do not have sm but i have questions Hello, i made a post a few days ago where i say i met a girl with sm and since i want to befriend her i want to also understand how sm works. So if somebody could give me a general explanation it would be very helpful, thank you if you read this or answer\nI really appreciate it &lt;3 :)\n(I tried to look on the internet but everything is about children so does not really help because this girl is 25) It is not a shyness, but a situational thing/anxiety, SM can apply anywhere, and it can, not apply anywhere.\n\nOther than that, you can read a ton on here, there is a lot of information from everyone else here. Everything else from my experience is sort of cookie cut, but here it is good information.\n\nI like( videos on SM. Though I do not agree that it is something you eventually grow out of...maybe something you eventually want to grow out of.....I think in some ways SM can become less over time, and in other ways it can become much worse. I at 18, think it is worse then it was at 10 and before 10. It was better over the summer (in a long time), but has since gone back to being bad and worse than before in ways.\n\nEdit: I wish I could go back to when I was 10, that was really my true Y-point in the road, between SM developing into something much worse, or breaking away from it. It is always been there in aspects since I was very very little. I have SM, and although I do not make new friends often, I really appreciate the people like you who make an effort to be a part of our lives and reach out. \u2764\ufe0fI would recommend taking baby steps. For me, it really starts with something as small as a smile or when they do something nice like sit by me or hold open the door. I would not recommend forcing this person into conversation right away, because that is really nerve wracking for people with SM. Start by giving a little compliment about their outfit or something, and just go from there. Whenever I start to feel comfortable around someone new, I find our conversations suddenly moving from one answer words to multiple sentences, as I imagine you will experience with your friend sometime soon. Even if it takes awhile, do not give up, all you need is a little patience. Hope this helps, and good luck! Thank you &lt;3. We usually stay next to each other working in silence but sometimes i ask her questions, only yes or no question, and she smiles or shakes her head for an answer. We chatted very briefly once, but i feel like that as well makes her uncomfortable. Thank you for sharing, and thank you for that youtube channel, it is helpful &lt;3. I am sure things will get better for you in the future and you will be happy wether it is with sm or not. Much love from here &lt;3 Like I said, just be patient! :) Even if she seems uncomfortable on the outside, I will bet that on the inside she really appreciates you talking to her, but maybe just cannot find the words yet which is totally ok. Just give her time, but also keep talking to her to let her know you have not given up on her Thank you again, we exchanged a few text today and found out sone things bc s we have in common, i will be as patient as she needs because i feel this will be a special friendship! &lt;3 Aww that makes me so happy! Yeah texting is a great step I did not even think of, so good for you for finding some common ground on some things!", "I am so stressed I am scared to talk Every time I talk I start fights at home. It is looking like my father has the virus so I am stuck at home with him and my mother for the time being. I have a really bad relationship with him and we are constantly fighting and I cannot escape the house so I have decided to just stop talking to stop the fights. I have done this before when I get really angry I stop talking. Based off what you said, it sounds like you are choosing to not speak to avoid arguing? I think people get a bit confused with the name, but selective mutism is when people are *physically unable* to speak in certain settings, despite wanting to. It is actually an anxiety disorder. Sometimes you need to kill people with kindness. You can get in the habit of being the calmer one every time. The one who speaks lower and listens until thev other person is finished talking. Sometimes it is better to hear someone out whether you agree or not", "selective mutism when having difficult conversations Title. Whenever I have emotional or difficult conversations, I go mute. Its really frustrating because I want so badly to be an emotionally mature, functioning adult who can have adult conversations. but I get so exasperated trying to force the words out that all I can do is cry. \n\nWhat makes me the most distressed is that it is causing some turmoil in my relationship. i need to seek treatment for this. \n\nHave any of you all had any success with treatment? So when you try to have these discussions how does that go down? What is the context? I am the same way. I think it might be related to bpd, but I have not gotten help yet. Do you suspect you have borderline personality disorder? I think mine is related to severe anxiety. I have GAD and PTSD, but I have never been evaluated for BPD. What symptoms do you show that are related to BPD? With bpd, it is hard to regulate emotions when dealing with things important to you. For me, that is my relationship and my and my significant other. There are cycles of intense positive and negative feelings. There is for sure a lot of anxiety tied to that. When I feel that things have gone wrong, especially in person, I \u201csplit\u201d and am unable to speak. My reactions manifest in a similar way to ptsd responses or panic attacks. Seems like you and I go through pretty much the same symptoms. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. Going mute during hard times makes you feel so powerless\u2026 I agree. I have not gone to sessions yet, but I heard that DBT therapy helps", "Q&amp;A with host of Outloud Selective Mutism Podcast July 29  EST   View in your timezone:  \n  \n\n: \n\n\n^(_*Assumed EDT instead of EST because DST is observed_)", "Why do teachers feel the need to do this? My classmates were discussing how I do not talk and my teacher was like \"No she talks to me all the time,\" which is a lie. Why would someone say this? Also the pain of a new teacher coming and them asking for your name but you cannot talk so you just sit there and the other kids dying of laughter explaining that ur a stupid mute. Must be a teacher thing.  Who knows\n\n\nI have experienced this.  There was a time my drama teacher said to some students \u201cI was told that \u2014\u2014 was selectively mute, then I said in the meeting, SHE talks ALL the time!\u201d As a joke. But to me I was embarrassed and horrified so I mustered up some courage and told the teacher at the end of the lesson not to do that because it is. Secret. she was so guilty and apologised lol People do this all the time to me but in my experience, I think it has to do with them asserting dominance. Since I do not talk, people act like they can talk for me and say things that are not true because they know I will not be able to confront them. If I was able to argue back, they would not say things like \"she is so loud and talks all the time\" \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It is like they can joke around and get away with it because they know I am too anxious to call them out. This is just annoying. Teachers should know that saying stuff like this does not help in the least bit. Idk I was never really conflictive and went along with everything, as it was hard for me to ever get mad. Kids were good to me....I cannot remember anything too standout. Some assholes, but I wrote them off as such..........................cannot remember much else\n\nExcept when the teachers were collab-ing with my parents to try and get me to say stuff to the teachers, and I had to ignore the teachers...because I do not want to be associated like that. Or a substitute who does not know you picks on you to answer the question and you are just panicking and everybody turns to look at you. Sometimes they even start yelling cause they just think you are being rude Ugh, yeah, my third grade teacher did this to me on several occasions. Obviously since she was my regular teacher and not a substitute, she should have eventually been able to see that I was just shy and anxious. But instead she would scold me when she called on me and I just stayed silent because I did not know the answer and I was anxious/embarrassed and could not say anything. She always thought that I had been daydreaming and not paying attention, and that I just did not know what she had asked me.", "This is a Selective Mutism descriptive essay I recently made for school. Just in time for Awareness Month :D  Thanks for sharing this essay with us! Wonderful! You write very concisely Thank you for writing this. It is  painfully accurate. Everyone wondered what was wrong with me and I could not explain them, I just felt bad and guilty for being me. I am going to share this explanation with my familiars and of course I will credit you.", "Selective mutism and other mental illnesses are like cancer... Even as a sufferer, you do not really understand it. You can talk about the nausea, the pain, the secondary effects but you cannot heal it. You really do need an expert. You do not know the 10 year prognosis, the effective ways of treating it, how bad it actually is.\n\nIf untreated, selective mutism can take hold of you and you can be 30 or older and still struggling with it. I myself am a very socially anxious adult in part because it was never treated. However, I still figured out what the problem was, found the label. I found other people who had the disorder, I found different techniques to handle my anxiety on my own. Not ideal, but it helped. \n\nIf SM is like cancer then the ways to treat it are operations. It is really delicate and there is a lot that can go wrong if you just ignore the problem or use the wrong methods to make it better. \n\nI want to highlight how there is nothing any bystander can do can heal the 'cancer'. Nothing you can say or do will make it go away. It is up to the sufferer, his body and the process of educating himself on his illness and going forward with treatment to overcome it. That is why I think giving power to the person with SM through educating him on his illness and giving him control over his treatment is essential. It is 100% his battle and family and friends can only ever be supportive.  Thank you for your post. Do you have any tips to give parents who may have children with SM? Anything that your parents did that helped or perhaps that you wish they would have done, looking back?  I would just say, really work on your relationship with your child and especially the way you manage conversations surrounding their SM.\n\nThe experience I had I would say is probably not the norm and my parents just were not there at all so it is hard to think of the struggles the average sufferer might run into.\n\nI do not now, I think in general, SM is something that isolates you, makes you feel really vulnerable and what the child needs is to feel empowered and like he knows exactly how his illness works and how another person can help him sort it out. \n\nI always felt like I was almost hurting my family just by having the illness. One thing you do not want is to have their SM be the elephant in the room. I am from one extreme case of everyone deliberately blinding themselves to it. In my case, it is something that actually runs in my family, there are young children who are struggling with it and I even have one adult family member who was also very deeply affected by it but my family's so dysfunctional that no one will acknowledge it. I bring it up and they straight up deny it ever happened but I am in a really complicated situation. My family's really weird, I do not expect it to be the norm. \n\nNot being able to see it, though, was so, so damaging to me... I struggled with it up until college and it played a big part in me dropping out. It is something that is really hard to get over unless you deliberately work on it. It does not go away on it is own. So do not ignore the problem and make sure your child understands what he is up against. Do not be afraid to talk about it and to educate your child on the illness regardless of his age. You cannot manipulate, cajole, bribe him into speaking, as you might have heard... It is a real illness and he has to really understand it and be motivated to work on it for him to get better.", "Breathing to speak The bottom of the belly releases hormones upon expansion that tell the brain to be excessively calm. This type of deep breathing is practiced through the diaphragm in succession. What is your experience with deep breathing exercises to avoid social calamity? It works up to a certain point for me. But from my experience that certain point is passed really often. Indeed, and while focused deep breathing can help remaim below the panic threshold it also usually means I have no attention for talking I notice when feeling uncomfortable I guess you could call it, I tighten up in the belly then my chest then my neck and jaw making it more difficult to get air therefor adding to the anxiety of everything. When I do the deep belly breathing exercise, it loosens all those muscles allowing me to get more air and think a little straighter which makes it easier to talk. Sometimes I feel like all the air and words are being choked until I do that. I usually have to keep at it though because I will just tighten right back up. Look up to the ceiling and press your tongue through the roof of your gums, hold it for 5 seconds and massage the neck. Yes, same here. It would help a little but sometimes it would not be enough. I would try to breath through the diaphragm before a presentation, or when I knew the teacher was going to pick on students to answer questions. \n\nI found that trying to do it so abruptly and while my breathing was so shallow from fear made it difficult to perform it properly. When I learned to do it all the time, were when things improved.\n\nI suggest looking to the ceiling whilst pressing your tongue to the roof of your gums. Do this for 5 seconds while massaging your neck. When you bring your head back down, swallow and your muscles should be loose and your voice more manipulatable. Thank you, I will try this!", "idk idk if i have selective mutism, but i have only recently been having troubles talking\n\n*by recent, i mean 1 year or more*\n\nit started when at school, couple of people began calling me \"Mouse\" coz apparently my voice was all squeaky. what started as a simple taunt began bogging me down every time i spoke. it led me to feel uncomfortable coz i never knew when next they would call me that. i kid you not, there have been times when the *whole* classroom laughed at me for speaking. i do have a nasal voice that has a funny intonation but i doubt if its kind to make fun of me like that.\n\nso yeah, it is not really *natural* but now i feel insecure talking. is this selective mutism? Hello. I personally, don\u00b4t think it is Selective Mutism, although I am not an expertise on the subject. What you described is probably a case of Bullying and need to be treated. Talking may be affected by it, but I don\u00b4t exactly know its consequences. Talking to your parents about it or even your teachers is a really good idea. Maybe if this doesn\u00b4t help as much you could consider going to another school. Saying such a big thing to someone may seem hard and almost impossible, but if you do so this situation will certainly get better. I have never met you before, but I am pretty sure your voice is beautiful and maybe even squeaky, but as I have two mouse pets, I am pretty sure I would love your voice.", "small progress i have been in therapy specifically for sm for a little over a year now and i had a doctors appointment today (a new doctor) and i answered nearly every question on my own without help from my mom.\n\noh and i am also able to order at drive thru\u2019s now too.\n\ni am so proud of myself. these are things i have never been able to do before. while i still get frustrated at things i am still not able to do, i try to remind myself that at this time last year, i did not think i would be doing these things. and here i am. This is so cool! Congratulations! As a parent of a 6 year old with pretty severe SM I got to tell you- that is a great accomplishment!! Great work!!! It is not easy and it comes in baby steps but you are moving forward and should be incredibly proud of yourself!! Good Job! Seriously. I am very proud of you! Well done. Drive theoughs terrify me - I have literally never driven to one myself. There is just too much pressure!", "Has my partner (m, 31) developed mutism? My partner has been quarantined with me since he usually lives with his dad who is a high risk due to his age (and he spends most nights here these days anyway). \n\nIt is been all fun and games up until last night when he jokingly picked me up, forgetting I had a procedure the week before and chronic pain, which triggered a major flare. I was mad at him for not thinking. I had just set up online yoga, feeling really happy to not be too sick to do it and instead ending up in bed on painkillers. He apologised and said he \u201chates himself\u201d. I was more mad at the situation than him as I know it was not on purpose. After I got out of bed he made dinner and did not speak all night. I was then annoyed he was giving me the silent treatment but also worried he may have been showing signs of depression, he was almost catatonic and I was worried he may hurt himself. \n\nThis morning I persuaded him to have a shower and decent breakfast followed by a walk together. All totally in silence but not mad at each other, just getting on with our normal routine and he seems quite happy. \n\nI have been looking into selective mutism  but not sure it would just hit someone like this with no prior history or mental illness? He is currently in counselling following a toxic relationship many years ago, and has received weekly counselling since. He is said he is had \u201canger episodes\u201d but they are usually down to lack of sleep and time on his own (of which he is had plenty this week) \n\nHe is managed to get some of his feeling across in text, just stating that he is sorry, he wants to talk and cannot, he is scared of why that is and he thinks he is mental. \n\nI was worried about him a few days prior to this, he is a musician and music teacher and that is obviously been cancelled as have his upcoming gigs. He usually goes to the gym but has been slacking on his gym routine and staying in pjs all day. He is naturally quite introverted and in his early twenties spent years not leaving the house. I have been worried the quarantine and routine changes may have been leading him back to a dark place but he claims that is not the case. I am not an expert on sm, but I know I often cannot talk about something upsetting, for days, even if I want to. I have to process first. Sometimes it is easier to write an email to my partner, and ask for communication through that medium. He may just feel so angry with himself that he is furthering punishing himself by not actively repairing the relationship. It is hard, too, when he may just need some physical space, but cannot get it. I am glad you are on his side. :) Thank you :) I just found out my best friend is in a coma due to corona. Not having anyone to talk to during this is awful, is there any support for partners? I am so so sorry. I know I have seen online some chat apps to get support. Therapists are offering telephone or online appointments, but that can take a while. If you have any friends you have lost touch with, now is a good time to reconnect.", "Is it SM if i dont talk to just about everybody? The only people I can talk to are my brother and two little sisters. I used to be able to talk to my older sister, but as the years go by i find it harder and harder to do. She thinks were just growing apart and beats herself up over it.\n\nI cant talk to my parents, any of my other relatives, or strangers. If the situation calls for it, I can utter a few words, but only very quietly so people dont usually hear it anyways. \n\nIs this SM or could it be something else? Sounds like SM that has grown into progressive mutism. It is the same thing except it presents as being unable to speak to anyone in *any* setting, rather than having at least one \u201csafe\u201d setting. Ive never heard of that until now, thank you for bringing it to my attention. Because of covid, i cant get treatment yet, but when i can will it be harder to treat? Noone around me is willing to help despite me constantly asking and talking to a therapist was impossible last time i had one. It will most likely be harder yes. The more severe your SM is the harder it is to get out of it, from my experience. As far as finding a therapist, a lot of SM specialists only work with children+teens rather than adults, because there is still a misconception that SM is a childhood disorder. So if you are older you might find it a lot harder, unfortunately. sounds like classic SM to me.\n\nsome days i even struggle to talk to my closest friends and boyfriend and can only communicate through text etc, other times we can talk a lot, when my SM is not bad i can talk to others, but the more stressed out/anxious/in pain/overloaded i am the more i lose ability to talk. first time i experienced this i was 5. only times my SM went away for more than a year at a time was when i had recovered from some trauma but before i went through even worse trauma lmao\n\nso yeah, good luck. it is reversible and treatable... just know that in my case it was like at least 50% gone for maybe a year or two at my best mental health (which was still garbage) and the worse my mental health gets the more people i struggle to say any words at all to, and yea in worst case scenarios cant even talk to people i trust, or to myself out loud.\n\nSM is not like some static thing where you have it or you do not and you are at a set level of SM for the rest of your life. the example about your sister there. my understanding is that to treat SM, you need to identify and process and learn coping skills alternatives for SM-triggering situations, it also has to be like a gradual build up over time as therapy progresses.\n\nbasically you need a therapist who both understands SM and also understands how to use psychotherapy to help you deal with whatever your SM triggers are sounds like SM to me", "Selective mutism is dangerous when things get sexual (TW: sexual assault) On one hand, I cant talk about my sexual desires with a partner. It feels like if my throat closes up. If I do get words out at all, they will be almost impossible to understand. Usually by the time I communicate a sexual desire, the guy is no longer in the mood. \n\nBut on a more serious note, there have been times when i could not ask someone to stop, or ask them to get away from me. I have found that sometimes guys will misread you scooting away or trying to push them as playful.. maybe playing rough? I dont know. and im such an anxious person that if i push and they do not let up, ill usually just let something happen. I learned to disassociate early in life (for non sexual reasons) it was a good coping strategy as a kid, but the dissasociation on top of the SM has prevented me from protecting myself a couple of times, usually at parties where I am already overwhemed or oversocialized.\n\nI have this reputation for being a little slutty. But I think its not fair because I would have had much less sex if I was able to say the words \"no\". Im also autistic so I have definitly misread obvious sexual signals as being friendly, which really sucks. So I have PTSD from what felt like rapes to me, but what the guys genuinly beleived to be conpletely consentual encounters. \n\nIt was the same dang story over and over. The guys would flirt, I would go with it without realizing. OR WORSE I would try to match their energy (so I would flirt back, without even realizing that that is what I was doing) The guys would give clear indications that they wanted to have sex, I would be oblivious and go with it without realizing. They would start to make me uncomfortable, but like 93% of human interaction makes me uncomfortable so I would not know where to draw the line until it was too late.\n\n Next thing I know we are in a seperate room and they start kissing me. I get confused and frightened and cue the SM, If I stumble away from them, they hold me closer. Instead of fighting, I start to dissasociate. I tune everything out, and the next thing I know there is just this horrible Pain. I come out of my dissasociation periodically and try to move away, but at this point I am feeling very weak and nervous and do not have a lot of fight in me, so my attempts at getting away are weak and unconvincing. They think im playing around or trying to get them to be rough, they do not realize how badly I want them to just be far, far away from me. I count down from 100 over and over until it stops. They finish, and them they just act like normal. \n\nIts as though everything is fine. They tell all their friends what I let them do.. The reputation gets even worse, which puts me at even more risk of it happening again. \n\nI have no way to call out for support because I was never really raped. The guys genuinly did not know how I felt. I think this is the thing I hate most about SM. It does not matter how much flirting or whatever happens, they should have asked for a clear \u201cyes\u201d of consent before doing anything like that. What they did was r*pe and your feelings about that are 100% valid. I am sorry that happened to u... I just want to make sure u know that. If u actually want to do something n ur comfortable enough writing/texting those might be good alternatives, but none of that stuff was ur fault, and those guys should not have done that \\^This.  \n\n\nAlso, you are not alone. Sending love. I have not read the whole post, but you mentioned some of the guys you have had sex with cannot take no for an answer. If you are freezing up and they keep going, that is on them. They sound predatory and you have to understand that or you will keep putting yourself in dangerous situations over and over again. \n\nIf you have ended up in bad situations because you would been drinking, it might be safer to not consume. They know what they are doing. They are bad people. Or they are ignorant or stupid. It does not matter. It is still rape. They sound SO predatory and gross. It just sounds like rape. You were an easy target because of SM. Look, whether the guys are malicious or ignorant about consent is almost irrelevant, both are awful. It is rape. Calling it that does not automatically mean you want the guy in prison or even think he is a bad person or anything. It means you are acknowledging that the situation harmed you and you need help to cope. Whether it is reported or not, whether you *want* to report it or not, it was still sex without consent, which is just rape.\n\nIt is normal to downplay your own traumatic experiences, but trauma is trauma. I would recommend therapy if you are not already doing so, or bringing this up if you are. It seems like you need two broad types of help: processing what happened to you, and finding a way to communicate your boundaries and preventing it from happening again if you can. My husband and I use the concept of safe words from bdsm, modified into hand gestures for SM. That is an established relationship, but I am sure with a bit of brainstorming you could come up with a more or less universal gesture to say no. The first that comes to mind for me is crossing your arms in front of your face or chest like an X. I am so insanely sorry you have to deal with situations like this. SM makes even TRYING to communicate in a situation like this impossible as it is so entirely traumatic and overwhelming. I am not sure if this would help you, or you would be able to access this in certain circumstances where you are being preyed over, but have you ever tried to use an AAC app? There is many out there that you can program a specific sentence or phrase and all you have to do is open your phone/app and press the phrase. For example, if things are going to far, reach for the phone ASAP (try and keep it close to you or on you ESPECIALLY when around men) and press the pre programmed phrase (for ex. \"No! Stop! I am not comfortable with this. Do not touch me!\"). Maybe this can be something possible for you to use? Society is really messed up about this. This is why it should be known that clear signs should be given before sex, or any other intense activity. I would say it was rape even if they just thought it was consensual, and some probably knew what they were doing. Some people with SM cannot communicate at all in certain situations. From the written account, this person is clearly trying to communicate from the inside, but that does not mean it will be noticed from the outside. I am not diagnosed, but from my experience it is not necissarily just about speaking. It can also be anxiety about having an effect on people, and the communication its self. Also universal gestures are not always easy for autistic people to come up with. I am so sorry this happened to you. You need some serious therapy to process this trauma. What happened to you is awful.", "I am unable to speak in voice chat Last night I had a moment while I was playing Pokerstars VR on my Quest 2. This lady asked why I was so quiet and asked me to say something but I could not, this is normal for me in voice chat for the past several years and it is quite frustrating. It is so debilitating I cannot even speak to my own friends online that I have known for over a decade. The strange thing is back in 2004 I used to used to be the total opposite in voice chat. When Xbox Live was a thing I would talk to everyone, I would do impersonations, loved to make people laugh. \n\nI wish I could figure out what caused all this though. What runs through my mind when I cannot speak is usually just thinking how I have nothing to really say to people except hi or hello. And I worry that my lack of interest in talking to someone will scare them. I enjoy listening to others though make small talk, it is entertaining since I lack the ability to spontaneously come up with random banter like they do. This happens to me, too. I wish I could offer some advice, but the most I can do right now is tell you I get it. This is kind of the opposite for me in VC im probably one of the most confident / loudest persons in the VC and I feel comfortable but in real life I can cant talk to random people or people at school if they approach me  Another day in Pokerstars VR, I am sitting at a table with some wonderful people who are having good conversation and I cannot say a word :( I stay for an hour and mostly use hand gestures and nods to communicate, and I could not even say goodbye to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was being mindful of the thoughts I was having when I felt that I wanted to say something. This time I noticed I was fearful that if I say something they may follow up with a question and want me to go further into what I just said. The problem is my thinking is so slow and I am so nervous I cannot formulate thoughts and retrieve information fast enough to reply. Long awkward pauses between spoken language also scares me. It is just so frustrating when it is in public and they have no idea how hard it is for me or what it feels like.

Eventually in the 2nd grade we got a van service. I dont know why, I stopped speaking when I would be in the van??? that is weird right? Like I would just nod and shake my head and if I was asked a question beyond yes/no, I literally would not answer even if i wanted to. I would be perfectly able to speak the moment I would step out of the van. It was like, I just could not speak even if I wanted to. I felt physically unable. Im generally a really loud and talkative person. I would be blabbering until the point where I would step foot in the van. From grades 5-7 my mom started driving me again. \n\nBut this gets weirder, from grades 8-11, I got van services again. Different drivers, different people. Weirdly enough, I STILL COULDNT SPEAK???? Up until I was literally 17????? Like this was an actual problem. If the van driver would ever forget to drop me I wouldnt be able to say it??? And I never talked to my mom or anyone about it. Wtf is wrong with me?  I guess that would be like it, but for me I think if (well I only really have problems with those that know I cannot speak)...you just speak once, just push yourself as hard as you can, it should be fine. Though I am not you, it seems like it...although I only have it (which I guess qualifies me), but I am no psychiatrist. \n\nThough do not hold this stuff over you, in my eyes it is the stigma itself which contributes to the SM (at least for me).", "Could I have selective mutism? I am not very good at writing or explaining things so I am sorry if I am hard to understand. Also, I am only 13 by the way.\n\nI have always been a really shy person, but recently I feel like it is been a little different. A little while ago, I had to go to a restaurant for a family dinner thing, and my family are very talkative and started bonding with the waiter. At one point the waiter asked me my name, and instead of just answering (which I would usually be able to do), I just froze, got really nervous, and looked over at my mom for help. I have been having more and more instances like this recently. Another one was a few days ago, I was doing some yard work with my mom and then the neighbor randomly came over to say hi. She asked me how I was doing and again, I froze, tried to get the words out, and looked at my mom. I am not sure if this is a sign or something that I could be developing selective mutism (even though I am 13) or if maybe it is just my shyness is getting worse from going to virtual school for a whole year. Which goes on to another thing,,\n\nI am really worried about going back to school next year. I scared that I will be super shy and start crying in front of everyone or just look super awkward when asked a question. My best friend moved schools this year, so next year I am not going to have her. I am not going to go too much into school though since I do not want this to be too long.\n\nSomething I see a lot of people with selective mutism say is that they really want to say something but they cannot. I wanted to know if this was more of an \"I genuinely want to speak to you, but I am unable to\" or more of a \"I am scared to speak to you and I physically cannot get the words out but I wish I did not feel uncomfortable, otherwise I would speak to you\" or maybe a mix between them. I feel like when I have had these situations it is been leaning more towards that I feel super uncomfortable and scared to speak, making me not even want to speak to them. I would rather not speak, than have to feel uncomfortable. But of course, I do not WANT to be like that and I do WANT to speak to them just not like \"Oh yeah, I would be comfortable speaking to you, I just cannot\"... It is more like \"I technically do not want to talk to you but I am really trying, it just feels really uncomfortable and the words will not come out\". Sorry if that is confusing.\n\nOne last thing that is kind of worrying me is that in the past week I have had two dreams about becoming selectly mute. I think the reason I am having these dreams is that I actually ALMOST like the idea of being selectively mute. Like obviously, I do not want to be like this, but at the same time, my brain likes the idea of not having to talk to people and having a title for it (almost like an excuse). I am not at all saying it is a good thing for people who have selective mutism, I just kind of feel that way, even though I do not really want to. Anyway, one of the dreams was just a kind of short one where I was at school and I was not talking so one of the teachers said \"She has selective mutism, so she does not really talk\". The other one was a lot longer and more emotional. A lot of the beginning was just feeling uncomfortable because I could not talk to people that know pretty well but have not seen in a while. But towards the end of the dream, I told my mom why I was not talking to them. I said to her that I think I have selective mutism. Her instant reaction was her yelling and screaming at me saying that I could not be selectively mute and I need to stop being shy... Yeah, that was scary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, it took a lot of courage for me to post this, so please be nice..  I did not really say a lot of things that I wanted to because I did not want this to be super long and boring (which I know it already is). So yeah, opinions? :/ This is a weird year. I think almost everyone will have some social anxiety. Impossible to diagnose on the internet. See if your mom can take you to a Dr for a diagnosis. Trying..

I dont hand notes talking  \nBecause im scared people would think im faking It. \n\nI am aware that my chilhood and early teenagerhood was traumatic. The question really is: Can i develop SM due to trauma? Because i Talk with my family and people close to me, i only can Talk with people around my age when someone is there who Can make me feel safe. Yes, it is less common for it to present later (like outside of younger childhood) but it does happen. My son was almost 12 when he stopped speaking. Selective mutism stems from anxiety typically, and it can come from trauma too. It is a vicious cycle, the more you worry, the more anxious you become. I bet a little Zoloft and some therapy will cure it. You have got to regulate your body and straighten out your head. I developed full blown SM when I started 4th grade. So I think it is possible to develop it at a later stage too. Just not common based on stats I was diagnosed with SM at 5-6 and iv always just had it, no traumatic experiences, nothing, seems I was just born like this I honestly do not know", "My daughter has SM &amp; as a concerned parent I need your help So my wife and I highly suspect our daughter has Selective Mutism, so much so that we have booked to see a specialist. \n\nAlthough she is only two (three in October), our daughter matches all the descriptors given. She will now only talk to us, pretty much. \n\nShe sees a lot of both sets of grandparents and does not tend to speak in their presence and at nursery we are told she will go the whole six hours without talking to anybody.\n\nWe have noticed that in the early mornings she will not say much more than a word or two to us for the first 30 minutes she is awake. I will ask her a question and she will manage a one word answer. Once she is warmed up with us, she is full of beans and will not stop talking. I have read this is common. \n\nThankfully, we are now aware this is more than her just being shy and we are both consuming as much content on the condition as possible. Reading some of your stories has been enlightening, although also concerning. \n\nI am fully aware of how Selective Mutism could affect my daughter in the future, not only at school but also as she goes out into the world.

Does this sound familiar?\n\nIn situations where I am nervous (any time I am around people I do not know or even if I know them, if I felt nervous around them the first time I met them, it takes a lot of engagement and support on their part to make this go away), I can feel in my head as if there is a membrane or portal between the side of my brain where I am thinking about stuff, and the side of my brain where I translate that into words to say, and sometimes that portal is just closed. When I try to look through it to get some words out, because it is important in this situation that I say something, it is just like looking into a black hole, my mind is completely empty. I can only just sit there silently panicking. It is not that I do not want to speak, because I very much do, I just do not what to say or how to say it. My mind is completely blank. It is like going to submit your homework to find the document is empty and you actually have nothing to submit. \n\nAs opposed to situations where I am not nervous, like at work or around family, the words just flow in and out of the portal, often in complex &amp; funny ways and I feel happy and relaxed. \n\nI have had this issue for as long as I can remember but I am only just now realizing in my late 30's that not everyone feels this way all the time!", "Social Anxiety Exposures While Physical Distancing  This is not mine, I found it somewhere and it looked good.", "I wish this was called more commonly called Situational Mutism Or something along that line. Selective makes it sound like a conscious choice I make on a day to day basis. I see that a lot in how some people talk about it. They \"cannot\" talk vs. they \"choose not to\" talk. They \"can\" only speak in certain situations vs. they \"will\" only speak in certain situations. Its certainly not a solution to the stigma and misinformation surrounding the condition, but I think it could help. At the very least, first impressions on hearing it may change, even if just a little, if it was not \"selective\". I do not know if you know, but selective means that the muteness happens in selective/specific situations, not that you choose to be mute (just in case you are confused)\n\nBut I agree with you, a person who knows nothing about the subject comes across \"selective\" mutism, the person probably will think you choose to be mute and may be confused. Changing the name to situational mutism would help in these cases I am aware. I have SM. I know selective by all technicalities is not necessarily a \"wrong\" term, but its one that is easy to misinterpret as it being selected by conscious choice. i have thought the same thing since i was diagnosed with SM like 10 years ago. \n\nanyone who is been told i have selective mutism automatically takes that to mean that my not speaking is a choice..when really i am unable to speak in 'select' situations..(even medical / mental health professionals)\n\nlike it used to be called elective mutism and i do not really see much of a difference between 'elective' and 'selective'..\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nbut yeah, i think changing the name to something like situational mutism would help a bit..or at least keep people from immediately assuming it is a choice. It is frustrating, I was trying to explain to someone why one of our children was struggling and they were like, well I have heard him talking to his mum so why cannot he just choose to talk to us? He can talk fine. \n\nThe word selective definitely made him think the child was just picking some people to talk to while choosing to ignore others. I wanted to tear my hair out, for someone who seemed to care so much about people using their words, she did not seem to actually understand what the words meant. I feel the same way I hate the name for that exact same reason! It used to be called Elective mutism, which was worse. I remember an actual nurse saying, \"it means she is choosing it!\" to the other nurse trying to ask me questions, and then they both got aggressive because I was \"being stubborn.\"\n\nSelective is better, because it is supposed to mean \"select situations,\" but I agree it is not fixed yet. Still too many people think the mute person is doing the selecting deliberately.\n\nSituational mutism would be better, but I have always wished it was Episodic Mutism. Cannot read too much rn, but yeah. It is good, but only if you know the true context of the diagnosis. I think I am going to call it situational mutism from now on. You are so right. The words we choose for things are important.

Focus on treating the anxiety.  Journaling, deep breathing, visualize yourself relaxing on the beach, listen to your favorite music, read a book, just anything that makes you feel good. The more you pressure yourself to speak (and the more others pressure you to speak), the more difficult it will be. You will need to find a way to release the pressure you feel. Remember that your voice is not gone forever. It will come back, and you do not need to be worried about it.

Perhaps this is a different problem", "I may have difficulty talking? Hi, I am on mobile. \n\n\nI do not typically have any difficulty talking, unless it is to strangers or in a difficult situation. Even then, I usually can still talk, it is just difficult. \n\n\nThere was one time, however, that I could not talk at all for several hours, due to severe stress and anxiety. Would that be selective mutism? Hello, SM is chacterised by muteness only to certain people or in certain situations.\n\nAlthough SM starts with complete silence or can progress to \u2018just\u2019 difficulty talking to others.\n\nIf that difficulty is due to anxious feelings it is likely part of some kind of social anxiety disorder or part of SM. Only a professional can diagnose.\n\nAsthe sidebar says SM is an anxiety disorder. The inability to talk is both caused by and often the cause of anxiety and stress.\n\nAs for your lasts question, extreme stress  has been known to cause temporary muteness, but if it persists or happens regularly than it can be part of a long term condition. Thank you for your timely feedback, that helps me understand a lot :) Selective mutism is a situational anxiety disorder characterized by the inability to speak/communicate in certain social settings (I.e. school, work, parties) due to severe anxiety. They are able to communicate freely in settings where they are comfortable, secure, and relaxed, such as at home. Some people with Selective Mutism who feel more comfortable and less anxious in social settings are able to be more verbal. \n\nAlso, selective mutism is an anxiety disorder, so any added stress/anxiety can make it worse. This response helps me alot, considering just recently i was informed about SM in response to a comment i made not too long ago (look at my history if u want background)\n\nSo anyway are there any kind of other conditions that could be similar to SM? I feel i relate to this sub, but doubt i actually have the condition. Social anxiety is similar to selective mutism. Over 90% of people with selective mutism have social anxiety. The only difference is people with social anxiety do not speak to avoid embarrassment or judgement. People with selective mutism are physically unable to speak due to severe anxiety in certain social situations. Does it only extend to social situations? Could there be trauma involved? Also are there ways to relieve such conditions?\n\nSorry if I am asking to many questions, just things like this are interesting to learn about In severe cases, selective mutism can extend into all situations with all people. This is called progressive mutism. \n\nWhile it is very rare, trauma can cause Selective Mutism. There are very few cases of trauma being the main cause of SM. \n\nThere is a way to overcome selective mutism. Typically it is done through exposure therapy (baby steps are key) and cognitive behavioral therapy. School support and understanding from family/friends is also important.  The problem is that there are relatively no therapists that treat selective mutism in adults. The only existing specialists are for children/teens. Oh wow Is there any specific reason why there are not any therapist fur adults? Mostly because of lack of understanding/knowledge. Most therapists do not even know what selective mutism is at all. It is really unfortunate and frustrating. Man that is terrible", "Am I experiencing selective mutism? or am I just overwhelmed? Ok so here is the problem. Whenever I get overwhelmed or upset, I go non-verbal. I can make noise but only in small whines or grunts. I physically cannot explain to people why I am overwhelmed because all I can do is gesture and make noises. I have ADHD, Tourette\u2019s, Anxiety, possible CPTSD and autistic traits. (it is a lot I know) I was wondering if it could be a result of one of the listed conditions, or if what I am experiencing could be selective mutism? That sounds like selective mutism (or at least what I experience). Ty for the reply! I will have to look into this more Same here Sounds like selective mutism with Tourette\u2019s added\ud83d\ude02 Well the grunts are not tics, they are voluntary (usually me trying to speak) It definitely sounds like sm because you physically cant speak in certain situations but it could also be autism considering you have autistic traits you should probably look into that too", "Do I have SM? I only recently discovered that this was a common issue but I think I may have always had it to some degree. I have definitely been diagnosed with social anxiety, so it could just be general introversion, but I have experienced a reluctance and almost inability to initiate conversations or communicate effectively in person or online. I have had multiple people give up on speaking to me because I am so avoidant, but most of my family does not seem to think I have this issue. I do have a few friends, so it is not as selective as I have read from other people\u2019s experiences, but I often develop an inability to speak to them after being around them long enough. I have also joined groups that are centered around discussion intending to participate but cannot seem to communicate effectively. Most of the resources I have found suggest a complete inability to speak in applicable situations but I have always been able to answer questions or respond to conversations if I absolutely needed to (despite being brief). Is this common for SM or is it just a symptom of social anxiety? Sounds to me more like social anxiety.\n\nYou do have some signs of mutism, but, as you said, it is defined as the complete inability to speak in certain situations, while being completely fine at home for example. When you are able to answer, albeit briefly, it is not selective mutism.\n\nBut then again, I am not a professional, only speaking from own experience! :)\n\nKeep your head up and work on it. You can get through this! Sounds much like me. Well, recently I have been becoming more open, but that is how I have been most of my life (19) and still am to a limited degree.\n\nMy mum deals with that kind of stuff as a profession and she is diagnosed me as all kinds of fucked up, but did not say anything about selective mutism.", "Jobs for people with SM? Just wondering if you guys have any jobs in mind? Anything non-customer service, pretty much. I was thinking washing dishes at a restaurant, or those jobs where you just put things on a shelve? Anything else?? I used to work as a janitor during the night shift, did not have to worry about talking too much lol I have had a few jobs as a cook in restaurants and one bussing tables/taking out the trash/generally keeping the dining room clean. As a cook some places expect you to talk more to other cooks or the servers, but for some its not as necessary. The other job I pretty much never had to talk to anyone and was not really expected to. Maybe work online transcribing audio to text? I was a book shelver at a small library and sometimes people would come up and ask questions like where the bathroom was and where to find certain things, but other than that I did not have to interact with people. I found that it worked for me despite having struggle with SM severely at the time. Oh! This seems sounds perfect omg. Thank you so much for the suggestion! A janitor seems perfect for someone with SM! Slight problem is that I have germophobia though. Thanks for the suggestion anyways :D Yup, I have always wanted to work as a book shelver but I was always scared that someone would try to come up and talk to me. I think I could also manage saying just one word or pointing in the direction. Thanks! Thanks for sharing! This seems like a pretty good option. I do not get paid for it but I do genealogy, very limited contact with people and I get to spend all my day going through records hunting for clues. I love it and if I decide to get certified will see about charging people. I had to search up genealogy because its a term I am not familiar with, but omg! You have such a cool job! You should definitely charge people cuz I am sure you can make quite a lot.   Thanks for the suggestion! I did once consider working in Health Information Management where you just sort through files and records but that dream is long gone lol. dont' work as a shelf stocker in a grocery- you get written up if you dont greet every customer who walks by you.  unless you are third shift and the store is closed during the overnight, but they chat to each other a lot on third shift. Thanks for the advice! I have generally made a mental note not to work in grocery stores because it is quite apparent that you need a lot of communication, especially when customers come to you. Also I hate seeing people I know \\*shivers\\*. But now I definitely know not to work there (thanks btw). I was thinking shelf-stocking in behind-the-scenes places like a warehouse, etc, but since I have never worked there I do not know how much communication you end up needing there either.", "Thughts to words struggle Hey\nSo I am 24, only last year I was diagnosed with autism and adhd and a few other processing disorders includinf language. As a kid I would not speak to new people, I would not even speak to my aunt as I would only see her a few times a year for under an hour. \n\nHowever, I have always had the issue that in any stressful situation, arguments, interviews ect, my mind is stuck on the first sentence eor point brought up and still trying to get to a sentence to say when the person is now on say the 3rd or 4th point.

Does anyone else do this?", "I cannot be the person who indicates a conversation. Background, I am Swedish, I have 5 siblings, and I am 17. I only have two people in the world I can comfortably talk to, and that is my mother and my youngest sister.\nI can you know start talking to them and stuff, but for any other person, if I want to say something, I just cannot. Even if I like want something from one side of the table but to get it I have to ask my brother.

Oh I feel very similarly. Although I prefer not talking at all, I can answer questions if I have to but I just cannot for the love of God be the first one to say something apart from when I am with my family or when speaking to one of the few friends I have. It is extremely frustrating and embarrassing. I remember learning \"Hello\" in high school.  I helloed the hell out of my reasonably surprised classmates.  Did not have any follow up, but I was proud as a peacock, for a time. Perhaps one day I will learn this power. Me too, I could never ask for help from anyone, say a teacher for instance. I remember in computer class in first grade, I missed directions on how to get to a website. I sat there the whole class just staring at the screen, hoping a teacher would notice. She noticed and saw I was about to cry, but she did not help me. Instead she looked at me with disgust, probably thinking I was just refusing to ask for help. I just really could not find my voice. I saw her shaking her head towards me and whispering about me to another teacher later. That shit hurts, especially when you are 6. Years later and I still remember. I have had similar reactions. It really is awful, and I do not understand why people make assumptions and just decide they are unequivocally right. I relate to this so much.", "Crying in Class Does anyone ever cry in class during school?\n\nIt happens to me almost everyday.\nI do not really mean full-on crying, i mean maybe a few tears coming out.\n\nI just feel lonely not being able to talk to anyone sometimes.\n\nI also cry because of boredom..sounds weird but it is pretty boring when all you can do is just space out. I cried a lot while I was little when I forced to do presentations (in front of the class lol). But maybe your overwhelmed? I am not too sure how I could help you but maybe feelings get too overwhelming at times, I think breathing slowly in those moments could help. :) and I can relate to the boredom, sometimes it just feels nice to let it out. I do as well! Even at 22 in college, sometimes i just feel out of place and uncomfortable and it will build until I cry a lil bit", "Sign Language? I do not have sm, but I have been very interested in it ever since I learned about it. I have always wanted to ask someone who has it: Would it be useful for you to learn and use sign language? Or is that no different from actual speaking? about 9 years ago, i went completely mute and adopted sign language. i have always had selective mutism and trouble speaking in certain situations. it makes no difference that sign language is now my primary language; i still have problems talking in certain situations. Why did you start using sign language? I have overcome my SM now but at that time I used to communicate through a lot of gestures (not sign language). I was 6 years old and I remember seeing my parents doing a kind of waving to say 'thank you' when driving so I adopted it and started using it at school. I think it would be really useful to learn sign language because the difficult part for me was only the talking part, not actually communicate. I tried learning sign language because speaking gave me so much anxiety, but I had just as much anxiety using sign language. It did not help much. I think it would depend on the situation. Some I would be comfortable enough to use sign language with, some it would be like speaking. my dad casually mentioned it while we were walking one time and i started researching it and i found it really cool and fun. A lot of the time, SM does affect non verbal communication as well, making sign language just as impossible. I was one of those people, so while I did take the time to learn it, I unfortunately could never use it, even if I wanted to. For the people with SM who are not affected that severely though, it would definitely be beneficial. The one thing about sign language is that the other people in the life of the person with sm needs to know it as well.

Her approach was to punish me if I did not speak, which is not the right thing to do. At all. So I would definitely be careful who you go to and put a lot of thought/research into it. But keep in mind your brother may or may not speak to the therapist. I have seen mine for a year and still have not uttered a word  My youngest has SM. We took her to her Doctor with our concerns and she recommended a local psychologist that was trained in helping children with SM. Within two months, our youngest was saying small words to the psychologist because she implemented a no-pressure interaction with games and rewards for participating. She now will speak with many people she does not know in smaller words and phrases, which I attribute to the nurturing way she was treated by her psychologist. Punishment is never helpful. If you like and trust your doctor, start there and see what they can recommend.  Well I also have been suffering from this condition since early childhood and what made my condition worse was horrible environment of school where I was bullied by my teachers even till the college.\n\nThis lead me to extreme social anxiety and depression and very reserved and ultimately mute behaviour.\n\nThings got little better when I entered in university where teachers were not bully and were quite corporative.\n\nBut even entering into mid 20s I am still suffering a lot to the point I cannot even fulfill my own needs and relay on my home members l.\n\nI recently met a psychiatrist, had about 3 visits to him and then I stopped visiting him when he said if you keep quiet then we will have no option but to give you electric therapy to give power to your brain so you speak up.\n\nI am still looking for my way out.\n\nIn your case, the best thing you can do for your brother is to ensure he has pressure free environment especially in school and dont let him encore his mutism by realising him that he is actually mute and meanwhile seek a good therapist. I went to my GP for something unrelated and my parents brought up issues with me not speaking which lead to learning that it was SM. My parents were told that specialists that might be able deal with teenagers like this would be very expensive. So they never sought any therapy.", "embarrassment and a little frustration :( In my school curriculum, there is a 1 hour slot every week during online class for teachers to interact with students. During this slot, each student will have 2-3 minutes to talk about their life during quarantine (the video cam and mic has to be turned on). I always get so anxious when it reaches my turn, and when it does, I freak out and start to freeze. There will be a moment of awkward silence and the teacher will say \u201cjust talk\u201d, \u201ci never heard your voice before\u201d, \u201cstop wasting everyone is time\u201d or some other criticisms which I do not feel like sharing. This week, I tried using the chat function but the teacher told me not to use it and that he will not read whatever I wrote... He goes on to start talking about me infront of the whole class about how I am going to fail my orals or presentations. I always do not feel good after that period and sometimes I hold back my tears, I still tell myself that this will be over though. I have no idea how to tell him that I have SM because he always seems intimidating and might criticize me for having it. Even after reading this paragraph, I still feel shaky because his words lower my confidence a lot.\n\nOn the other hand, I have improved a little :) I recently started doing some video calls with my friends and talking to them loudly. I hope that one day I will be able to feel comfortable around more people... This sounds like grounds for disciplinary action. Can you report the teacher for misconduct? You *need* to tell him, it will help him understand why you cannot speak!! I realize this may be too much for you, but what if you emailed your teacher, explaining that you have SM/what it is and that it is not a choice for you? That might help. Often people are rude like that because they just do not understand. I made an ( for this purpose, maybe you will find that helpful. Not every SMer is able to, unfortunately. SM loves to stand in the way of getting help and support. A lot of the time it affects all forms of communication. That is horrible. wow that teacher is a real cunt :(( im sorry this had to happen to you Understatement Could you prerecord a video, then share your screen? \n\nIn any case, email this teacher (cc in principle) and explain that you have anxiety as SM. Also point out that the way this was handled at X date and time (in front of other students) was humiliating and is actively worsening your condition. \n\nBe sure to use dates, times and quotes. Your teacher is an asshole. I do not have any helpful advice, just as an adult and a teacher, I wanted to validate that you are doing nothing wrong, he is the one who should be embarrassed, and there is no reason to think you will not be successful in life.   \n\n\nActually, as to practical advice, is there anyone else- another teacher maybe?- you are more comfortable with that you could bring this up with? If you are in the US, the school is required to provide accommodations, but it sounds like maybe you are elsewhere and I do not know all the rules, but I am sure a more compassionate person at your school would be able and willing to help you. Honestly, if I found out that another teacher at my school was treating a student so poorly, I would be angry enough to help the fuck out of you just to piss them off :) Like another comment said, even though it will be tough, I highly suggest emailing your teacher. Or if possible, have a guardian email and advocate for you. That aside, that behavior from a teacher is inexcusable and gross. You are doing so well trying to speak, and it is amazing that you are making progress with your friends. Keep up the good work. Remember that the important people in your life care about what you have to say. Might not be a bad idea.\n\nHappy cake day by the way lol I love this document by the way, I am really glad you made it. I think it was originally a response to one of my posts, and I have used it to help explain to friends, coworkers, and bosses. It is been real useful so thank you Please please please tell someone -- the principal, anyone. That is an INCREDIBLY insensitive and irresponsible thing for him to say and do. You may not realize right now how fucked up that is because it is probably normal to you, but I am telling you, there is a lot of things I have looked back on after recovering and realized they were NOT as normal as I thought they were. If you were to contact the principal or whoever and tell them what he said, explained your situation, and how it made you feel, that would be more effective than contacting him directly. To me, that guy sounds like a huge dick and super disrespectful, and he probably will not realize just how fucked up that was unless it comes from someone above him.\n\nAt the very least, you might be able to get some kind of exception. You should not have to be put through that every week. I am so sorry that happened to you and good luck! Also, if he does it again, record it.", "Does anyone also have dyspraxia? I am wondering if there is a connection between the two. Many people in this community are also autistic which means they might also be dyspraxic. I have dyspraxia. \n\nI had selective mutism from around age 11 to 17, particularly badly between 12 and 14. \n\nQuite a lot of my childhood anxiety stemmed from things related to my dyspraxia and how this intersected with school. My 6.5 year-old suffers from both selective mutism and dyspraxia (and a few other things as well). My hunch is that there is not so much a direct the connection between the two as that they tend to share common root causes.\n\nI do not experience selective mutism the same way that other people describe it, but man do I experience dyspraxia. That is interesting. I assume that her difficulty arranging words combined with the anxiety of social situations makes her \"freeze,\" but that is only a guess. It is hard to separate my fascination with the root cause from the pragmatic question of what will help her function best in school and society. My daughter had selective mutism- she is not dyspraxic, but non-autistic dyspraxia runs strongly in our family. Yep. I also have adhd, ocd and tourretts. All of these things lowered my self esteem soo much, which is what caused my SM I believe. When I was younger I had a speech impediment, which made it hard for me to pronounce the r sound. I think that is one of the main reasons I have SM.", "School was always fun...  Lol exactly what happened to me, a teacher was mad that no one was replying to his questions so of course  he asked ME out of everyone else, then told me to look up something on the internet and i just frooze whithout saying a thing or moving. How does the teacher not know about your all\u2019s condition is what I cannot seem to rap my head around , why would your parents not let them know that you have SM , but in all honesty as serious as SM is how the actual fuck do you go about your adult life or get anything done if you are just paralyzed by anxiety all the time ?? I have a buddy whose daughter is 9 and has it I all I can think to myself is this girl is fucked , she will be helpless for ever and we will be dead by the time she is 22 if not sooner. I feel like I must have been the only kid with selective mutism who did not have shitty teachers. Most of my teachers had high empathy and they were more worried about my mental health than anything and a lot of them took a loving approach. I remember the time the sub opened a classroom discussion about why I cannot say anything Wtf Because not everyone understands what it is or even thinks it is abnormal. \n\nI bet most of my former classmates who witnessed me going through it still think of me as \u201cthat weird kid who will not talk and cries when forced to attempt public speaking\u201d instead of understanding what was going on.\n\nOne of my parents had it as a kid too, we had no idea until reading WSJ that this even was a thing that other people dealt with and that it had a name besides \u201cdebilitatingly shy\u201d. My parent thought it was normal. I thought it was normal.\n\nTeachers only told my parents I was super quiet and shy and if I did not do my homework.\n\nAs for your friend\u2019s daughter, instead of deciding she is fucked for life, why not be a supportive ally? Because that is what these kids need. \n\nSM is an anxiety disorder, but kids can learn how to build confidence and speaking skills and to cope with this anxiety disorder in a less detrimental way.\n\nAre you really old  or sick cause I do not know why you would be dead by the time she is 22? I got sent the the school counselor, who apparently had no idea what SM was or anything. She was just like, \"You have to talk. Go. Talk. Bye.\" I do not think anyone was particularly mad at me, but definitely not helpful either. Did your peers' theories surprise you? It was not really long enough for much discussion, mostly just \"idk\" and \"he did not talKK\" Why do teachers get mad are not they supposed to be passionate and help the kits and not yell at them for a mental problem they cannot control really easy if at all always make me super mad ", "Do people with selective mutism have more empathy if so why? ? I have seen that studies have shown people with SM can have heightened sense of right and wrong not sure why though Theoretically no. \n\nSome studies show some people with anxiety disorders may be more emotionally sensitive, which may influence their empathy scores but SM is an anxiety disorder not a disorder that affects empathy or theory of mind. I score low on empathy. You would think. But sometimes people are so concerned with themselves and recovering and worrying that they do not have the mental capacity for others. So it is kind of just depending on the person. I have heightened empathy for certain types of people and little empathy to other types.", "My oldest son (8 years old) has SM. Lately my 7 year old son (adopted 1 year ago) will talk for him. Should I do anything to help or hinder this behavior? (Cross-posted to r/parenting)\n\nSo I have 2 sons.  The first is my wife and I's son.  He has selective mutism and does not talk very often even at home.  About a year ago, we kind of got shoved into adopting a family friend's kid after they passed away.  He is about 8 months younger than our son.  (For brevity's sake we will call the oldest son Connor and the younger one John).  They always got along before we adopted John and now they get along even better.  However, since they have been living together they have become almost inseparable.  However about 4 months ago John has started talking **for** Connor, and I do not mean the typical little kid \"He says I can have his dessert\" type thing but like \"Connor's cold, can you get another blanket down from the closet\" type talking.\n\nWe would been taking Connor to a therapist and working on his SM and he would been slowly getting better but now he is talking even less than usual.  Half the time when we ask Connor a question, John will respond.  For example, Wife: Connor do you want ketchup?  John: No he is good, I would like some though please.  It is like this for just about every question directed towards Connor.  Besides that they are like two peas in a pod, playing and goofing around and watching cartoons, everything normal brothers do together, except one of them does not talk.  \n\nIt is honestly kind of unnerving how John seems to know exactly what Connor is thinking and now the school thinks the next best step is to put them in separate classrooms, basically to try and force Connor to start talking in class again.  The therapist thinks that this will only cause Connor more anxiety, but also agrees that as long as Connor continues to rely on John to talk for him he will continue to fall behind in his speech.\n\nHas anyone else ever had a kid with SM that acted like this?  Or siblings that did something similar?  How did you get them to stop while also nurturing the relationship?  My wife and I are just at a loss as to what to do next.  Do we let the school separate them or try and fight them to keep the kids together? The best thing to do is to make sure Connor is never in a situation where he feels forced to talk. If he only feels comfortable talking through John then continue with that. However, if you can tell that Connor is not communicating with John first before John answers then you have a problem. Like you said in your post, John might be saying what he thinks is best for Connor and for a 7 year old, I do not think he always knows what is best. \n\nHere is my suggestion. Can Connor read and write? If he can try to get him to write down what he wants to say. \n\nI strongly advise against forcing him to talk. Do not do it at all! \n\n Also, have you heard of sliding in? It is a therapy technique used to treat selective mutism. It helped me to overcome about 90% of my own selective mutism. Here is a video explaining it: \n\nIf you would like I can send you the email of someone who can explain it in much more detail. \n\nLet me know if you need any more help.    I know this is kind of late but;\nI believe the kids should not be separated,  talking to them about not taking advantage when speaking for him might be a useful step but in my experience (admittedly as a teen) having someone with who i felt comfortable greatly reduced my anxiety and made me feel safe to say one or two words, as well as ensuring there would always be someone there to play/hang out with so i was not entirely alone in breaks.\nAlso forcing a child to speak will never work, i remember (and heard from my mum) that teachers refused to feed me unless i verbally asked for food, so in response i just never ate at school until the practise was stopped.", "Thank you I had a relationship with someone with SM for a few years.

I do not write much like this, so it may not make sense, but I just wanted to express my thoughts about selective mutism in some way. \n\nIT DOES, AS IT CAN:\n\nA tree, it grows, extends its leaves, and absorbs the sunlight.\n\nA bird, it sits upon the tree, and sings a beautiful song for all to hear.\n\nAs it does, as it must. As it can, as it trust. \n\nA cat, it climbs up the tree, and pounces on the bird. \n\nAs it does, as it must. As it can, as it will. \n\nA bird, it is gone, and no song Is sung. \n\nA tree, it is branches, and its leaves seem so undone, but sunlight is still absorbed. \n\nAs it does, as it must. As it can, as it will. r/poems Sorry, I was not trying to spread awareness for a poem I was writing or anything like that, I just wanted to express myself through a poem since I can sometimes struggle to get my point across so I thought I would try it this way, sorry. That is if you were redirecting me. No need to apologise, I just thought maybe you would want more people to see your post Oh okay, thank you. This is really cool, but my slow self cant make much sense of it. Could you describe what you are saying in this poem? Idk if that is taboo when it comes to these things, but I would like to understand it better. Thank you, I can try, but the poem was my way of trying to express myself.\nI guess, Everything that is referred to as \"it\" is living, and I saw the cat, tree and bird as one working group  with different parts, much like how in real life this cycle continues again and again, I guess like the circle of life. So \"it\" kind of could represent a person with selective mutism, who perhaps reaches out like a branch of which a bird sits on to sing, this represents talking I guess and the natural and essential need to do so. And I guess the cat is the part that stops the song, and could represent the acknowledgement of danger and predators of life in a way. The tree absorbing sunlight i guess represents that \"it\" is still alive and receives information, and further more, will still continue the cycle of wanting to talk as it is only natural.\n\nSorry if that was too long or pretentious, and I hope it made sense. That is a really good explanation, thank you. I think I get it now Cool! I have alot of trouble coming up with metaphors myself, and I am also no good at poems. How does one draw these connections for analogies? I liked your written explanation for the poem too.\n\nTo me, the poem seems to speak of tragic inevitability. The bird can sing it is beautiful song, but eventually it is going to get taken down by that cat. In fact, it is the very act of singing that draws the cat to it. If this is about selective mutism, then the bird is the act of talking, and the cat is that self-consciousness that leads to embarrassment over having spoken. After having it is bird eaten, the tree must wait for another bird to alight in its branches. But why would one come when the cat is still there?\n\nDo not mind me; Just trying poem interpretation. Thank you. I really like your interpretation, it is actually very accurate to what I was trying to say.", "y e s . \ud83d\udc49\ud83e\udd20\ud83d\udc49  Story of my life If this are not me Apparently I am playing never to get", "could i have sm? should i seek help? hello! i just found out what selective mutism is and i think i have it. i am 14 years old and do not know if i should reach out to my parents + a doctor for help.\n\n\n\nwhy i feel like i need help: \n\ni am silent almost all the time. whenever people (anyone; strangers or family, i do not have friends) talk to me or ask me questions i freeze, stress out in my head, and just stay quiet. i usually only answer yes or no questions or if i have not said anything in a while. i avoid eye contact a lot. when i try/want to speak, my mouth feels stuck because there are so many thoughts in my head and i do not know how to express it in words. i feel like the words will not come out right, like people will not hear me or understand me. i can only express myself when i have a good amount of time and when i am writing, like right now. i have been like this for about 2 years now, basically ever since i lost my friends and ended up on my own. and even when i did have friends, honestly i was still uncomfortable talking to them and the only reason i got them in the first place was because they came to me. but i have always been quiet, especially during school. from kindergarten to now (entering 10th grade). when teachers would call on me i would freeze. when i needed help i would not ask. when literally anyone would talk to me, i would start tearing up because i felt so much pressure. i stopped talking to my family for about 4 years now because i felt like they did not understand me and they would pressure me to talk more, but i also feel like it is my fault because i did not tell them what i was dealing with. literally i only ever talk to them if i need something and it makes me feel like crap. but sometimes i will just sit with them silently to give them company. i feel really bad and would like to try to connect with them again. also, something i noticed is that im more comfortable talking to strangers than people i know. i feel like the fact that i will not have to talk to the stranger again means they will not personally know me. honestly, i am really scared of having people i know see me fail. this makes me scared of building relationships with people. \n\n\n\nshould i tell my parents?:\n\ni plan on texting my mom (i almost always text to communicate with my family) to go to a doctor to get help or something. i want to tell her that i might have sm. but like, if she says yeah and we go see someone, what do i say?? every past experience i have had with doctors has been pretty bad ngl. i usually rely on my parents to talk for me, but i would talk when i had to (aka when my parents literally had to beg me to talk). still i felt incredibly uncomfortable speaking and having my parents with me in the same room. i am kind of lost. \n\nanyways that is it. tysm if u reply or read this at all. i am really happy i found out sm is a thing because i have been feeling so alone for a while now and i feel like i finally figured something out that is been going on in my life. like seriously, this is the happiest i have been in a while. i am looking forward to getting help soon, but i am afraid it will not work out. there is a lot more i could have said, but this post would go on forever plus i am tired. anyways, i would love to hear ur thoughts about my concerns and ur experiences with reaching out for help if u feel like sharing. Hi! Im 14 years old with diagnosed sm at the age of 3 by a doctor.\n\nFrom what you have written sounds a lot like selective mutism, I can see that this is frustrating and exhausting and having it myself I totally agree.  I hear your troubles of telling your mum or family member and going to the doctors, my advice would be to say or text something like \"Hey, ive been having a lot of troubles with communicating for a while and its becoming a problem. I hope youll understand but i think i have selective mutism, which is a anxiety disorder which makes a person freeze in social and non social situations and unable to talk and get words out. I think I should go to the doctors about this because Its affecting my daily life and i need some advice\" This is just an idea for you. If she says yes, well go to the doctors you could say thank you for understanding, i love you. Something like that. \n\nFor now try not to worry ik its easier said than done but I think its good that you have found out about sm and i hope you get some clarity on this \\^\\^ \n\nIf you have questions about sm or more advice feel free to message me :)\n\nAll the best.", "I feel like I will never be normal I am 22 and I am pretty sure I have selective mutism; never been diagnosed though.

Got in trouble constantly throughout elementary school because I would only talk to a few people (my best friends) and never to the teachers. It got so bad that I started homeschooling (which honestly made things worse in the long run). At some point, I believe I was 11 or 12, my general anxiety began to get worse and I stopped talking to all family members except my parents.\n\nNow, at 22, I feel like I have not improved that much. My parents obviously knew something was up (they have even mentioned SM multiple times over the years) but never took me to a doctor or anything.

I talk to my parents and my younger cousins, but I still do not really talk to the rest of my family.\n\nMy parents are the main ones that make me uncomfortable. I cannot talk to anyone else when my parents are there, not even my cousins. If we are at a restaurant, my parents will literally order my food for me because I cannot talk.

I was so nervous and kind of freaking out, and the tattoo artist was talking nonstop.. I kind of just shut down and barely said two words to him the whole time.

So our old conversations I still could see and I saw her online when I got my new number, that is how I found out. It was by accident). So we started talking through her mums phone with my new number (I did not mention anything that she blocked me on her phone, I kind of just left it) and we just talked about different things and it was nice. Since lockdown (I do not have selective mutism) I did not know what to say to her because my life is quite boring. So I was silent for a few weeks, nothing major, I just did not know what to talk about; then she blocked me on her mother\u2019s phone. \nI had to contact her dad (on Facebook) to tell her basically saying (not word for word, but you get the point). \n\u201cPlease do not block me. I know you have SM and autism but I am not going to drop you as a friend because you have SM and autism. That is wrong of me to do that. You have never broken my trust, so I am not going to break away the friendship. The only time I will break a friendship, is by someone breaking my trust and you have never done that. I will accept any communication, you do not have to use your voice, I do not mind. Also, you are not annoying in anyway shape of form. I will accept you as you. I love you for you. Heck, my bf has ADHD and I would not change anything about him. Just like you, I would not change anything about you. Just please do not block me. Next time please have your family member, therapist, PA or anyone you trust come message me, that you are not doing okay and I will leave you alone until you feel better. I will be here, waiting. Just talk to me when you are ready. Absolute no rush\u201d \nThen silence, I have not heard from her since or her dad. I know she has Pinterest (she does not follow me back, well she does not follow anyone) and I follow her on there. (I even changed my profile picture of me and her together so she will not block me on there, so she knows I still want to be friends with her. I even did the same thing to my WhatsApp profile), so if she does message me (when she is ready of course) she can tell that I do not want to break a friendship because she has SM. \n\nRight now I am terrified to even message her directly, I know she has Facebook, Pinterest and of course WhatsApp. But I do not want to message her because I do not want to her to become worse. My bf said, let her come to you. \nI honestly think I am the only friend she has. She has pushed everyone away, her mum told me that down the phone. I do not feel bad, I just do not want anyone to feel lonely because I know how it feels to have no friends. It is the main reason why I am not giving up and she has not broken my trust. So I am not going to give up on her. \n\nI just feel so in the dark right now and I am worried. I do not have SM, I have been educating myself on what is it like. It is why I say \u201cI will accept any communication\u201d. I know I should said from the beginning \u2018what type of communication will you feel comfortable with?\u2019\nBut with her going none verbal 2x within months, is making my anxiety hitting the roof. \nShe is a full grown adult with server SM. I do not know what to do. Please help. this wont be what you want to hear, but she is an adult and if she no longer wishes to have contact with you, you have to respect that. you cant keep pushing and trying to force contact with someone. especially if theyre going through something like this. you keeping pushing it will not change what theyre going through, or alter their mindstate. i do appreciate that you want to help and connect and offer friendship, but when you have repeatedly tried to do that, you must respect where theyre at. You are completely right. It is hard to accept im really sorry this is happening to you. what i would do in your situation, is leave a final message for them so that they know you are waiting and that they can contact you at any time they feel comfortable. and that you wont be upset if that isnt right away. so they know you are there for them and not under pressure. Thank you, I will say that. I did not know what way to put it, you know. Thank you It sounds like your friend could be jealous, but does not want to tell you. I am saying this because I know that jealous people can have completely normal conversations with someone when they get texted, but if it gets bad enough, they would try to end conversations quickly cause the feeling of envy is just too overwhelming, especially when their friends mention things that trigger their envy.\n\nI am saying this because she \"pushed everyone away\", and you are saying you were the only friend she has.\n\nI do not want to sound accusing of anyone and please dont take this the wrong way. It sounds to me like she is depressed with no friends, and cannot even make any because of envy.\n\nThe best thing to do imo would be to do absolutely whatever you can to match her with someone who is similar to her, maybe someone of her preferred sex/gender.\n\nIf im wrong, great, but if you have any reason to believe this is true please do something about it because then you would have something of a crisis on your hands. The sad part is I cannot do anything about it, I tried but it just fails. She only has a select few family members she still talks too. Her mum told me this and she even pushed away a guy that she liked; all her mum said \u201che keeps going out with his friends. So she pushed him away\u201d. \nOn the envy part, what you said makes total sense. Like it will explain a lot and I mean a lot! I have been friends with her for years and it explains her behaviour towards her sister and her own family too. \n\nI know she is depressed and refuses to leave the house. I know she had many tries at therapy but it all failed. So I cannot help as much. I even take private therapy but she refuses that (I know private therapy in England \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 is costly, but it helps me. So I sent her the link where I found my therapist. Again, just refuses). So I really cannot help her. \nIt is why I am stuck. \n\nBut again, what you said makes total sense. Thank you. Give her mom your phone number and leave it at that. Nothing left to say with her. If she is compelled enough, she will come to you. If not, there is nothing you can do about it. Not all friendships last forever. Yeahh I did that and I just left her to it. I completely agree with you", "r/selectivemutism Best of 2020 (\n\nHello, readers of r/selectivemutism!

I seriously cannot ask for help no matter how much I need it. I am very disconnected from my emotions with other people so it does not even seem like a possibility for me. Not even writing it out feels right. It sucks so much to suffer in silence, I would not wish this on anyone.", "Does anyone else have trouble speaking in physical-terms? I have had SM since I was 4, and am turning 18 later this year. Just like everyone else with SM, I could not speak when in anxiety-inducing situations. I cannot talk at school, to people I know from school, and to the majority of my family.\n\nHowever, it was not until recently when I realized that I often mess up when I am talking (even when I am not feeling any anxiety). While talking to my closest friends, I mispronounced a lot of words (although they were just your everyday conversation kind-of words) and tripped over my tongue.\n\nI feel like it is due to the fact that because of SM, I do not have as much experience as most others when it comes to talking. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? I stutter, I do not talk to people much but I talk to myself a lot, mostly about history because I am a history junkie, and I stutter a *lot* Like you said, I stutter a lot, and mispronounce everyday words...even with people I am 100% percent comfortable with. I have also been diagnosed with expressive language disorder because of my SM, so I think that contributes to it Have the same problem. It got better for a few months, but it got worse again. Makes me nervous to talk to the people I am comfortable talking to Yeah, me too Even without SM, I caught myself saying \"lol\" as an actual word instead of laughing before, haha Yep, I definitely had trouble talking and stuttering for a long long time, even once I started talking to people who were not part of my family. My brother does that, too, and I thought it was odd until my friend pointed out that I say \"lmao\". Funny how language is these days :')", "Does This person I know have Selective Mutism? I want to first of all say that my ignorance might shine through, because I do not know much about the topic.  Basically, i know this person that has been diagnosed with Selective Mutism at the age of three and has gone through life struggling. However, this never went treated properly and so they are now currently an adult with Selective Mutism. The thing is I cant decipher whether this person has Selective Mutism or just a more extreme general anxiety. They have issues talking to people they have never met, but they will invite people over who they never met in person to their house at a really late hour. Any information to make myself more aware of Selective Mutism and I hope I did not sound too ignorant. Selective Mutism can be caused by anxiety (or other things) and is referred to as an anxiety disorder in some professional literature.\n\nSo, yes, they have Selective Mutism, and, yes, they may have a grneral anxiety disorder. I have selective mutism and it is mostly triggered by my anxiety amongst people I do not know in spaces where I am not comfortable. And I have brought strangers home because one, they are just one person and two, it is my comfort space. So, I do not have much difficulty vocalising, although I do get a stutter sometimes.

Congratulations,happy for you! Thank youuuu\ud83e\udd70 You give me hope for my 8-year daughter. By the end of high school, I got so angry &amp; tired of feeling the way I felt and my anger caused me to stem out of it. My advice would to be to just keep pushing your daughter to never give up. My mom pushed me and never let me feel sorry for myself. She refused to let me think I was different from everyone else and had me engage in all sorts of activities just like any kid would. I was a happy kid. It takes time but one day it will be okay. It still amazes me I was quiet for so long. Somedays I do not know how I am where I am today. I got diagnosed with Type1 Diabetes when I was 10. It made things even harder cause I was afraid to speak up if my blood sugar was high or low. The anxiety made my blood sugars go high when I would worry. Even with Diabetes, Selective Mutism was the hardest thing I have ever gone through. Have hope \ud83d\udc95 praying for your daughter.

I was recently shortlisted for an interview with several other people in my class. I am really dreading it, although I can communicate verbally when I am comfortable, I hardly talk to my classmates, I am also prone to suddenly shutting down,becoming nonverbal and crying when I feel overwhelmed with anxiety or when I feel too pressured. Any advice on overcoming this?, or should I consider skipping it? You could maybe try practicing with a trusted adult of your family, like maybe your friend\u2019s parent or a family friend. But if that is something you cannot do, do not feel bad about skipping. Interviews are an important part of the working world, but I think it is better to skip out than suffer an anxiety attack. I do not think you should skip it. I mean, you were chosen for a reason. Try to keep that in mind when you are in the interview. They want you there more than you want to be there. I am not sure what you are interviewing for. But what helped me in job interviews was concentrating on what I would like to get out of the job I am interviewing for. \n\nIn the beginning all I wanted was a comfortable work environment where I would not be bullied by dim witted managers etc. So I would try to pry a bit into the interviewers work habits. I would try to see if they expected all their employees to work late whenever asked. I would try to find out how long the staff's been at the job. If people are constantly leaving or getting fired, that probably means the manager or the job itself sucks. I do not know at some point I realized, in any interview, I am interviewing the other party just as much as they are interviewing me.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is distract your mind by concentrating on what you expect to get out of the interview. What helps me is to rehearse or practice what I need to say. Ideally you can practice it aloud with someone you can speak to, but you can practice by yourself or even just in your head too. Rehearsing really makes a difference. But, if it is going to be that anxiety provoking and difficult for you, it is best that you skip it. Try to communicate that you will be able to talk more once you are comfortable. Also try to give off a \"oo I am just shy and cute\" vibe and not give a murder stare.", "How do you SM people ask for something while you are in a mute episode without any resources to talk with? genuine question, really curious.", "Heart is breaking over 6 year old\u2019s regression My wife and I are struggling with how to best help our son (6) deal with the quickly approaching virtual-school year.  \n\nWhen the pandemic struck it was, surprisingly, successful. He suddenly found himself in a 20 minute classroom where he was the only student with 3 teachers - The teacher, the special education teacher, and a classroom helper. He was even talking in what he calls his \u201creal voice.\u201d \n\nBut about a month in, things started spiraling out.  Nothing had changed at home - I mean, other than what was happening to everyone else in our country - but instead of being enthusiastic (that is probably an exaggeration) he was not interested in interacting with the teachers anymore.  He reverted to old in-person habits of acting tired and putting his head down or even hiding under our dining room table. \n\nAlong with this return of old behaviors, we have had to begin monitoring certain OCD behaviors.  They had been slightly present when very little but they have really turned up in the past month or two.  Though he does not have a problems getting filthy and being in direct, he has begun washing his hands on a more-than-needed basis.  Or he will insist on hand sanitizer and become upset if not given even a droplet. \n\nMy wife and I (me mostly, as she is the primary bread winner) may be homeschooling him and our 4 year old - thank fucking god they get along. Virtual school, even for a 1st grader is supposedly going to be 3 hours a day.  \n\nBy the end of his 20 minute kindergarten sessions everyone was worn out and upset.  We just cannot. \n\nI think at the beginning of this post it was to ask for homeschooling advice, by the end it may be more about needing to just type out my feelings. Any relevant advice would be so welcome. \n\nThanks. Every kid learns differently, which is one of the benefits of homeschooling.  I had sm when I was a kid, and I homeschool my kids.\n\nMy autistic son last year (age 7) could tolerate about 10 minutes of seat work (homeschooling) before breaking down in tears.  When our public school switched to remote learning this spring, we tried it.  He lasted about a minute before he got very angry at the laptop and broke down in tears.\n\nWe are trying a mix of seatwork and computer work this year, and while today was our first day, it seems to be working a lot better.  Apparently doing math in levels with mastery points makes it easier.  (Thank you Khan Academy!)\n\nI do not know your kids' curiosity levels, but honestly, we do seat work to prove that we \\*do\\* school, but most of my son's learning comes outside of that.  He freaking loves to learn; he is such a nerd, and I love that.  \n\nYour kids are young.  They absorb so much from the world around them.  I encourage you to try homeschooling for a while to see how it goes for your family.  Unschooling is great too.  :)  Good luck!  You are doing your best, and your son will appreciate it. It is probably the added stress of covid fear... He probably needs to talk about it and to learn ways of coping with the uncertainty of everything and the real threat of it. When he relaxes more, he can start focusing on his sm again...\n\n\nBtw, I do not think regression is the right term for this I am an autistic adult with selective mutism. I work in research with a massive social component but have found a way to play to my strengths because this world is not designed for people like me. I am a single parent as well to a nearly 10yo. She has had her  own struggles with anxiety. The biggest shift that has worked for us has been to hold space for the person to be mute. I know this plays into the negative reinforcement rhetoric this is used within healthcare. But having occupied multiple spaces in multiple capacities I firmly believe that capacity for communication and trust builds when others are willing to communicate on your terms - even if they are subaltern or different (as a function of age, language or any other category of \u201cdifference\u201d) Thanks.  This is good to consider.", "just found out about this sub damn, i hope you all are able to, like, I do not know how to say it, get better? No, that does not sound right.Huh, talking about something like this is a lot different than, say, depression.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is, i hope you all can live a good life despite having something as bad as sm. It sounds like it sucks really hard and I hope you all are able to cope, it sounds like living with it can be really hard. I thought I had it bad with my social/performance anxiety but you all are the real ones for living with sm.\n\nI would also like to know what happens with it, like when you cannot speak. I am honestly pretty interested and I would just like to know, like, what is going on in your mind when it happens. As far as what happens when I cannot speak, I can form the words I would like to say in my head, but no matter how hard I try, I just cannot say them. The words feel \u201cstuck\u201d, and there is a lump in my throat. Even my muscles do not work the way I want them too. They feel very stiff, and when I move, my movements are very jerky and robotic, which makes walking very difficult. This is all because people with SM generally have paralyzed vocal cords, and possibly muscles if their SM is more severe, making speaking and communicating nonverbally simply impossible. That helps a lot with understanding it, at least how it happens to you. You know what you want to say but you cannot get it out, that sounds like hell. I was diagnosed with SM in 2nd grade. Have you heard of fight, flight, or freeze? SM was a freeze response for me. I was extremely shy and had a hard time forcing the words out unless I felt extremely comfortable. I was more confident in preschool and kindergarten, but I have autism so I acted \"weird\" and other kids would avoid me or exclude me and I did not understand why. I felt like I was annoying. I think that was a factor in my SM developing.\n\nAs I got older, SM became less of a freeze response and more of a rule. In 5th grade, these rules solidified themselves extremely firmly. It is like the wire from \"thoughts\" to \"speech\" was unplugged when in certain situations. It felt outside my control.\n\nThe rules were: \"I can only speak to my mom, dad, and 2 brothers in any situation. I can speak to my close friends but not at school or gymnastics lessons. It is OK if I start speaking to a friend of a friend during a playdate. I cannot speak to anyone else in any situation.\"\n\nThese were not rules I consciously thought about. It was just what I defaulted to because I did not understand anxiety and how to fight it. It was more or less involuntary. I was a puppet to my anxious compulsion to be silent. I was just \"the girl who did not talk\" and I never questioned it.\n\nTo summarize: It felt normal. My thought process was \"I do not talk. I wish I was born as a person who can talk to anyone, but I cannot do anything about it now. This is who I am.\"\n\nBut of course that was not true and I recovered by going to residential treatment. I hope this gave you some insight into one person's experience of SM. so its less of \"i want to but cant\" and more of \"i just cant\".\n\nIt is hard to imagine but like i think i understand how it feels for you. I think your way of phrasing it is accurate to how I felt. I \"knew\" (inaccurately) I would not be able to speak even if I tried. Not speaking was a part of my identity and questioning it felt absurd to me. I think how much someone with SM *wants* to speak varies from individual to individual. For me, *want* was not a factor. I \"knew\" I had no control. I felt apathetic in a way. I \"knew\" I was doomed to never speak freely.\n\nI put \"knew\" in quotes because through CBT and exposure therapy, I worked a lot on my anxiety. As I went through the process of recovery, I realized this \"knowledge\" that I would never be able to speak freely was based in a false belief.\n\nI am always happy when people take an interest in SM. Thank you for trying to understand! Join the discord (in sub menu i think) and you can ask more people there Same. Definitely freeze.\nAnd it DEFINITELY became a rule for me too. Even though I did not speak to new people, I still feel like as I got older it became a rule that \u201cI do not speak\u201d\nI did not want to just change and start talking to people because I did not want the attention it would have given me if I started talking (mainly school back then)\nIt was probably a fear of changing (to start speaking) and people responding to that.\n\nSo really the fear just evolved and went round in circles.\nI cannot talk because if I talk people will freak because I just \u201cdo not talk\u201d I no longer struggle with SM, just social anxiety in certain situations, but it still kind of sucked reading this to be honest. It sounds like your'e saying, sucks to be you. I dont think i understand what you mean. If you mean that it reads like im making a joke out of it or whatever, i understand that, as i read it back to myself i did think it came a bit, idk how to put it, not offensive but kind of what you said, but i couldnt find out how to word it differently. Nothing in my post is meant to be a jab at people with SM and im sorry if you felt that way, i sincerely feel bad for the people that deal with SM. I had selective mutism since I was three, perhaps because I moved constantly due to my father\u2019s job. I would switched back and forth from three different countries before I was five. The ever-changing culture, language, and environment may have contributed to my anxiety. I also grew up watching my parents struggle socially, not being able to speak English either. My home life was not very stable.\n\nIt was a very physical feeling of not being able to speak. Silence became the norm for me and I was complacent because that was how I\u2018d always been.\n\nThen I started therapy in first grade. When I talked for the first time at school in the 2nd grade, my voice sounded foreign to me. It was difficult, but I made leaps forward with my therapist.\n\nYears later as a high schooler, I only have moderate social anxiety. I am back in therapy for more improvement :)", "Support Group for SM Support Group for Adults(21+) with SM forming soon.

He does not know I have selective mutism though. What can I do to help myself. Be kind to yourself first and foremost. \n\nIf you can expose yourself, little by little talking more and more and seeing that nothing bad happens, it might help. It is going to feel bad, but it is worth it to feel better later. You could start by talking alone, or with someone you are comfortable with. Then expand the circle little by little. Challenge yourself until you are more comfortable then add a new challenge. \n\nTake a look at stoic philosophy. Basically it is the idea that we cannot control anything outside ourselves, including other people\u2019s reactions to us, we can only control our own selves. Coming to terms with that helped me a lot with my social anxiety and SM, though it is still a work in progress. \n\nFor me, having good, kind friends was so important to my recovery too. \n\nI wish I had had proper professional support, but I did not.

Everyone was nervous and so everyone was supportive. It was a great environment to practice communication in a fun way. Thank you so much", "Is Social Anxiety Disorder and Selective Mutism the same thing? When studying psychology, a speech pathologist explained to me that when someone is unable to speak properly at times of feeling emotions blocking their ability to speak, the feeling is called anxiety.  This is when the person can speak in most situations, but cannot speak in some situations where that emotion blocks their ability to speak. The anxiety causes them to be temporarily involuntarily mute.\n\nAlso, anxiety can at times block non-verbal communication as well as perception or listening.\n\nThis anxiety is a situational anxiety, and the situation is a social situation.\n\nSo now I ask, how can Selective Mutism be different from Social Anxiety Disorder? Or, is Social Anxiety Disorder a specific type of Selective Mutism? I was told by my therapist that selective mutism and social anxiety are connected, but she did not tell me in exactly what way. I just looked up some scientific journals about the relationship between the two disorders and it seems that most of them find that having social anxiety does not always mean you are selectively mute and having selective mutism does not always mean you also have social anxiety. However, in general, people with selective mutism who also have social anxiety score higher on social anxiety tests than people who do not have selective mutism. Some psychologists consider selective mutism to be a subcategory of social phobia, but some believe them to be different conditions. There is no solid answer and people are still researching how the two conditions are connected. Selective mutism is a specific type of social anxiety. They are different in the way that social anxiety does not necessarily cause mutism. They definitely cannot be used interchangeably. Usually people with social anxiety disorder might choose to not speak to avoid embarrassment, but people with SM become physically unable to speak (mute) when put in social situations. From a psychological standpoint, the amygdala in people with SM has a lower than normal threshold of excitability. The amygdala\u2019s use is to sense dangerous scenarios and respond with a series of reactions meant to protect you. In people with SM, the perceived \u201cdangerous\u201d scenarios are social settings, and the reactions are paralyzed vocal cords, and inhibited muscle movements.\n\nBasically, SM is *driven* by social anxiety, and is a (severe) type of social anxiety disorder. I would say SM is like a more severe symptom of social anxiety, yet sometimes it can be caused by abuse (mental or physical) and by my own experience that makes the anxiety affect you in more situations that are not necessarily socially related. I do not know about the research at all, but I do not have social anxiety, but I have, though undiagnosed, selective mutism. My anxiety that triggers the mute response is the same as the anxiety my triggers for emotional flashbacks and panic attacks create, those are generally objects, sounds, subject matter, talking about my trauma out loud, and some specific places. I can be talking just fine, if we are walking we can walk past my old elementary school, I will go mute for a while, we move on from there, I continue just fine. We are talking and there is a radio on, there is an anti bullying campaign ad that comes on, I go quiet and start crying, I try to sign or gesture for them to switch the channel or shut it if they seem capable of it. One study (i do not have access to links right now) gave young children with SM and others with traditional social anxiety disorder psychometric tests regarding the severity of the anxiety they felt in social situations. It was found that both groups (matched pairs design) reported the same amount of anxiety/severity of anxiety on a scale  in social situations. This suggests that the two are distinct disorders, rather than SM just being severe social anxiety disorder.\n\nedit: Also many people with SM may be unable to speak but, if not put under additional stress, are still able to understand their environment with no difficulties. Some people are even able to write to others with fluency rather than speak. my girlfriend has dealt w SM her entire life ( from what she knows , doctors have told her she may have been traumatized , mainly raped , but it is a repressed memory and her mom has assured her that she has not been raped ) she does not know when she will grow out of it , she is 15 and has had people speak and do things for her her entire life . i deal with anxiety myself and i have an interview for a job tomorrow , life is hitting me like a truck like everybody said it would but i am worried about my girlfriend . she is been dealing with this forever and i know how impossible it is for her to speak in certain situations . what if she gets touched by some random guy when i am not there one day ? there will be nothing i can do and i am constantly thinking ab that , i have even had nightmares ab it . the sad thing is that she will never know if she is been raped or not , it is repressed and she does not even know if she is been around anybody who is done it , even now ? i could really use some help I am not 100% sure, but I think some people see social anxiety as a spectrum where SM would be the most extreme end. Although I think Social anxiety and SM are distinct disorders, with some commonalities. I know of a book where the protagonist gets an SM diagnosis then \"graduates\" to a social anxiety diagnosis. its a form of it just to where you cant talk in certain situations social anxiety is more of a fear of going out with people its just a more rare disorder.", "I have sm and desperately want advice So I have had sm for a long time, and I desperately want help, I just do not know where to start. If anyone has any advice for me after reading this story then if you can, give advice. Also if you just want to skip to the part I want advice at, it is the part when I am at high school\n\nIt started when I was 4 years old when I was at nursery, I am sure it started before that but that is as long as I can remember. I do not remember exactly what I did or how I felt, the only thing I remember is that I did not talk at nursery then.\n\nI was 4-5 years old when I started primary school, surprisingly though I actually talked freely in the first 4 years there, even when I was not meant to, though not with other people from other classes. The teachers and my parents noticed that I did not talk to people who were not in my class and just assumed I was shy. I do not remember any unique interactions for these years.\n\nI stopped talking in my own class after 4 years (when I was 9-10 years old) because the classes shuffled around, so because people from other classes were now in my class I stopped talking entirely at school, even to people who were in my original class. The next 3 years I learned to try to communicate in ways that were not speaking, which was just nodding or shaking my head, or writing down on paper what I wanted to say. The teachers and my parents obviously noticed I was not talking at all now, but still assumed it was just me being shy, which was weird because literally nothing pointed to that other than me not talking. I remember my interactions with others, but everything was pretty much normal other than me not talking, I surprisingly had actual friends somehow.\n\nAfter the 2 years at the final year of primary school, I was 11-12 years old. the classes shuffled again, I was too used to not talking to turn back so easily. My interactions for this year is were still quite normal but I remember having somehow new friends, which surprisingly they were the \"cool kids\". They did not call themselves that, they were just that kind of friend group.\n\nThen there was high school, when I was 12-13 in the first year, and 13-14 in the second year. though I am still in only the second year I will try to go into detail, this is the part where I need help and advice in. At the start, it took awhile for every teacher to get used to me not talking, most of them went easy on me, but some of them just acted like I could do the same thing as everyone else. I should mention that none of the teachers through all of this realized I had sm, or at the very least did not know what to do about it. Also surprisingly I made more friends, but they did not feel like they were actual friends, most of the time they just ignore me. Some of them even feel like they are being passive aggressive to me. There was someone who feels like an actual friend, I do not remember our interactions before high school other than we were somehow friends, and that we were still somehow friends now, they just talked to me normally and not acting weird about it. Though our interactions still are not normal, they are better than the others.\n\nIf anyone has advice on what to do, please say it. By advice I mean something like who should I ask for help first. Help with what? You should try telling your parents about it and go to a therapist maybe.", "Subreddits for mute people? Hello,\n\nI am not selectively mute, I have permanently lost my voice some time ago and I was wondering if there were any subreddits for mute people besides r/asl or deaf communities?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if the answer is obvious and I am intruding, I just do not know how to properly navigate reddit too well  I can help you with that, no prob! If you are looking for a community of permanently mute people, I have never seen such a thing on Reddit. \n\nBut there are still potential subreddits of interest depending on what you want. There are conditions where being nonverbal can be a symptom, such as SM, autism/aspergers, cerebral palsy, etc...a tip for you is to use google and type \"keyword reddit\" with keyword replaced with any topic you are looking for, for example searching \"selective mutism reddit\" would quickly bring up this community. There are also conditions that require alternative methods of communication, such as deafness as you mentioned.\n\nThe sidebar of this subreddit (to the right if you are on desktop) also has many mental health related subreddits. I am on an old version of reddit so it might look different from yours, but here is a screenshot \n\nLet me know if you need more info.", "The experience of being an adult with SM I have (23m) had SM almost my whole life. But I have never been diagnosed with anything other than depression and anxiety. I used to be completely unable to talk to strangers, but after six plus years of work in the food industry I can now barely make small talk with people.\n\nThe only time I can really open up is when I have been drinking. And I obviously cannot drink all the time. I feel like the isolation I experience allows my mind to play all kinds of tricks on me. And sometimes my perspective seems to be distinct from reality. Possibly co-morbid borderline or bipolar idk.\n\nId like to blame my lack of meaningful progress on my parents. I do not have money to go to therapy. I have a hard time even supporting myself. My mom paid for therapy once, but I missed the appointment. And now she said she is already tried with me and will not pay for therapy again.\n\nI have insurance. But my insurance has been accepted and then later declined so many times, leaving me to have to pay for every session.\n\nI live on my own and most people would see me as independent. But the lack of communication I experience makes me oscillate between extremely low self esteem and insecure arrogance. All of this happening on the inside. I am too ashamed of those feelings to be open about them.\n\nSometimes I will develop a crush on a girl, but then I will just try to forget about those feelings all together. Because I know I cannot approach her, and I know no one wants to be attached to the mute kid. I have tried to accept that I will probably be lonely most of my life. It is hard though.\n\nFeel like I want to get better, but no one even sees a problem. People constantly make me think I am doing this to myself, and I can choose to stop whenever I want. I guess I am just too dumb to change or something. Idk. That is the way people act. Like if you want to stop then just stop.\n\nI am so jealous of other guys that can make friends easily. Or can talk to girls without seeming like a scared child. I feel like their lives must be so fulfilling. It is easier to be alone if I am pretending to be doing it on purpose. Like, I am telling people I have chosen to be single. But really I have just given up on finding a SO.\n\nTLDR: I cannot afford therapy. Getting no help from my parents. My insurance sucks. Lonely af. How do I motivate myself to go get help? What options do I have?", "Do I have selective mutism?  Ew I really regret writing that fucking mess im so sorry", "When did you realize.. My entire life I have been shy. \nMy parents always needed to tell me to say hello and goodbye to people- which made me hate doing so SOOO much more. \nI could not sit next to \u201cstrangers\u201d, could not talk to strangers. \n- I was shy. \n\nAnd that is all I thought it was... \nBut behaviors have continued. And up until recently- I chalked it up to cute and corky and just who I am. \nI knew I was shy and I knew it took me a loooong time to open up and become \u201cme\u201d around people.. I wished I could just be \u201cme\u201d from the start but I just kind of accepted myself as this person. \n\nBut now, I am turning 28. And I have started realizing people do not think it is cute. I actually come off pretty damn cold and rude.\n\nI do not talk to people, even people I know at my gym (I go to a niche gym) unless they are like a very close friend (I have 3 at my gym) and I play a pretty intimate sport. I do not say hello, I will smile and mouth the word \u201chey\u201d back but no sound comes out usually. I will just start playing with someone without even introducing myself and they will end up doing it- which I will be able to respond with my name if they do that- but that is all I will be able to say. If I do not have a good friend there to make me feel \u201csafe\u201d - I am almost completely mute. \n\nWhat made me really know it is a real problem is that it is still happening with people I have known for a year. And in groups of friends, I will be friends with one person and I will be able to be nice to the group if that friend is there- but you take the friend away and I cannot talk to these people who I have known 5+ years.. I should not be afraid to say hello. But words just do not come out. And now I am scared. This problem has only gotten worse as I age and I do not know bad it can get but I do not want it to get worse. \n\n\nTl;dr\nAlways been shy.

However, I am currently at the library right now and I feel good to the point that I could strike a conversation with anyone. I have not felt like this in years. It is helped me a lot, but I found that I really enjoy bodybuilding, it is perfect for autistic people. Idk about working out, but practicing a martial art kind of helps", "Meta-mutism? I cannot talk to people because they know I dont talk and are familiar with me not talking, but I can talk to people who are not familiar with me. I  do not think I had it in the first place, but I just did not talk to the point where its weirder for me to talk. What do you think? does it affect your day to day life in a major way like not being able to talk at all at school?\n\nIt is not a unique thing to shut down against those expectations of others for you. I think it is weird for anyone who is been labeled as \"that one who does not talk\" to break out of that. In fact sometimes kids realise they are ready to break out of their SM by transferring schools/locations so they can start fresh without the extra burden of expectations. I felt like this when I was recovering. When people do not expect you to speak it is easy to fulfill those expectations, especially if they do not give you the space to, or you have social anxiety. Without the pressure of expectations it can be easier to use your voice. \n\nOne of the good things about this stage is that as you move and grow, you can improve and move past SM. Eventually, with enough practice out in the world, you can take that confidence back to groups that expect you to be quiet and assert yourself! I can definitely relate. I had to leave behind everyone I knew to be able to start talking and if I were to meet them again, I think I would probably clam up and have to force the words out because even though I have been talking for years now, I have not been talking to *them* for years and it would just be... weird. With people who do not know me, they do not care if I talk and assume it is normal so it is not a big deal but with people who do, they make it a huge deal to the point where it is just easier not to talk at all. It affects my life in a big way, I am planning on moving away so I can talk soon. Yesssss Hope it works out for you then I had that too. I had an easier time talking to people I would never see again (cashiers, random strangers, etc.) than I would with teachers or even grandparents and uncles/aunts. I do not think anything in selective mutism is a choice, so there is no reason for you to think you gave it to yourself. It is definitely a weird phenomenon though I do think I had and have the responsibility, it might not be my fault but its something I can change myself if I direct effort that way. But I guess I will rely on the 'easy way out' by moving.", "How do I make online friends It is impossible for me to start a conversation with someone online and especially to keep one going. I also hear that people with selective mutism are supposed to be smarter but I suck at writing, only thing i am good at is reading. \n\nI am very lonely and kind of talk to myself at night and pretend i have friends. I do have my brother, father, and mother to talk to but i am still lonely. As evil as it sounds I do not really enjoy hanging out with my mother. I spend too much time with my father and same with my brother.  You want to be friends? I have sm too, and our conversations do not have to be interesting and consistent, we can get better overtime  Hello! You could search for online forums or discord channels with people that share your interests? If your into gaming there is always text channels. Another option is facebook groups for any niche interests.\nIt is completely socially acceptable online to start with an occasional small comment like \u201cthat looks good!\u201d rather than launching into a full blown conversation. Some people with SM struggle to write as well, especially about themselves. SM is diverse.\n\nSM facebook groups offer support, as well as anxiety discord servers or other servers of relevance.\n\nI have an SM discord in progress but I dont know if I could moderate it at the same time as growing this subreddit. I need to put it in good hands. Hello there! We all have have our own things that we are good at, I am also not so great when it comes to writing (I am more of a slow writer myself just because I like to think before I write).\n\nAlthough I do not really have selective mutism nowadays, I still find myself pretty lonely at times. As everyone has mentioned here, it is best to find a community online with people that share similar interests. Yes, even I do find it a bit nerve-wrecking when it comes to starting a conversation online with someone or a group of people and whether or not I would be able to keep a conversation going.\n\nI always found it best to start out with small talk such telling people how their day is going, hobbies, interests, and so on. And there are times when a conversation can end or if people just stop chatting, do not think that you said something wrong. This can happen for various reasons, maybe some people are just busy with their daily life or just cannot think anything else to add to the conversation. I find that to happen sometimes and it is something that I have gotten used to. After all, conversations have to come to an end sometimes, especially in real life. I usually like to end a conversation by saying that I have to leave and wishing others in hope that they have a great day.\n\nFrom my experience, I always found this to be a slow process and then I eventually begin to open up a bit more as I become more comfortable with the people that I chat with. Once you find that perfect place, perhaps you will end up making a couple of online friends, which is something I would not ever have imagine happening to myself.\n\nI know this is just from my own personal experience, but I hope this helps at least. sure! sorry for the late response  As a physically mute person I also struggle to make friends/ communicate on online games I have SM too.

So it kind of first began when i was around 12 and basically before that time i always talked and I just remember talking to everyone and I was so confident too. I never really thought about what others thought. Then as I went into 7th grade I just remember sitting in class and I was just so anxious of talking to others around me. Then my stupid brain decided that it would be a good idea to isolate myself more and to talk EVEN LESS than what i was doing before. My social anxiety grew worse I got more nervous around people and I felt like everyone was judging me and i have felt this way ever since :D. But I also noticed that my communication is fine when im talking to people i am comfortable being around like close friends and (some) family. But whenever im around like people I do not talk to much i always answer and mix up my words all the time and its embarrassing AF.\n\nyeah sorry for anyone reading this i am currently writing this like at like 3am and im aware that this post has no structure or meaning to it whatsoever  but idk tell me what you think When yo around people you do not know do you reply at all or are you completely silent?\n\nFor selective mutism you would be unable to get any words out at all, although some people in recovery may be able to say a short reply when spoken to.\n\nCorrect me if i am wrong but from what you say you are still able to reply verbally, it is just difficult and muddled. Which sounds like social anxiety, still something which you can get treatment for to help overcome. Mhm probably social anxiety than. Thanks for the help!", "When I am mute I often if not every time cannot move This makes it challenging because sign-language is not an option, neither is writing on paper, a computer or a phone. I do know what triggers me to become mute and what makes it last longer but its sort of, uh, talking about myself and reaching out for help or showing any weakness, trust, vulnerability is what does it. This sort of does not work, its tormenting. I feel Like I am just broken. I was the same way, before I recovered. Sometimes I would be stuck frozen in the same place for so long my muscles started to ache. A lot of SMers are like that. It affects far more than speech. That happens to me too.

Or an app that says things already written so I do not have to type so much? I am not sure if this will help, but you can type into google translate and use the voice thing so it will say it out loud for you. Depending on what you need to be said, you could use communication cards! Simple, basic index cards you could keep on a clip would work, or there are people who make fancy ones on Etsy.

However, I am also trans (FtM) so my first word might just be my new name if they ever question what I would like to be called (I have been out to them for one and a half years, but the topic of getting called anything other than \"daughter\" has only been brought up once). If that happens, my first words after my first word might be yesses and nos.

I honestly do not know what if this is possible but I cannot find anything online about it. When I was little, before I can remember, at least since I was 5 I never could talk to people. I mean literally. My parents at first took it as me being shy then as me being weird and just learned to live with it. In church I once got yelled at from my teacher asking \u201cwhy are you even hear if your not going to be involved in the lesson?\u201d Because I was not adding onto the discussion. I am school it took me 3 month in kindergarten to talk to my teacher or even anyone but if my mom was there I could read to the whole class. I made some friends and could talk with them fine after a while. And was super chatty at home. However as I got older I got punished more for not talking and being \u201crude\u201d. All of the friends I have now I have known since at least the 3rd grade (I am in high school). I am homeschooled and do not go to church. I am able to talk with my therapist fine. But she reminds me of my older sister a lot and that is the only reason I can. I can sometimes force myself to talk to teachers or say a quick \u201cno thanks\u201d to flight attendants, fast food workers, ect. This sounds like sm to me but I also might just be shy. Is it even possible to have sm and be able to force yourself to talk to people occasionally now that I am older? I am going back to in person school in January and if this is even possible, should I bring it up with my therapist? I have tried using google and doing research but I will I have found is stuff about toddlers and nothing about if it is untreated or how it actually works. Please help, thank you! That does sound like sm to me. There is  lot more detailed information about SM in the pinned posts.\n\nThe difference between a shy person and an SMer can be blurry because SMers often develop shyness even if they didnt have it as a kid bc of worsening anxiety. \n\nIt becomes diagnosable as an anxiety disorder when the inability to speak to someone is prolonged for at least several months. Shy ppl generally \"warm up\" to talking.\n\nThe boundaries of SM are also blurry because there is no obvious singular point at which an SMer is completely 'cured'. It is a gradual retraining of the person's anxiety responses, and these can be weakened and strengthened at various points in their lives and in various situations.\n\nTreating professionals call it a \"bridge\" to communication bc of all these different stages of communication that can evolve. An SMer who can only respond to questions is not completely over their anxiety.\n\nTheres no harm in bringing it up to the therapist if you want to talk about it. Yep, that is typical SM. What is it lacking? I was diagnosed with SM as a kid and what you said about forcing yourself to say a quick prhase or a few words defintly happened to me yes this sounds like SM to me, as someone with SM i can occasionally force myself to talk to people but its a lot of effort. and like for you, forcing myself to talk ,has only really happened since i got older. i would highly recommend trying to get a diagnosis if you can, because then you will have access to more professional help You have pretty much got all the signs really", "Help planning talking points for an IEP/504 for a teen with selective mutism and extreme social anxiety?

It makes me so angry.

I thought I would be able to start speaking normally this year, but I could not bring myself to again.\n\nI am not by any means a shy person, I could always answer any questions or hold conversations with people as long as it did not involve verbal communication. I carry a notebook with me everywhere that I can write in, my friends are used to it by now.\n\nI have never been professionally diagnosed. I was simply regarded as the \"shy/quiet kid\" since kindergarten. It was not until schools started grading me for class participation (speaking) that they took notice on that I actually NEVER spoke. I would get questioned during class, not answer and get punished over and over again. When I reached 10 years old, my elementary school made me go to the counselor because it was not normal behaviour. The counselor tried to make conversation and it always ended with nothing.\n\nFast forward 2 years, the same thing has been going on. (But thanks to the counselling sessions I get to skip 1-2 periods lol) The counselor decided to give a letter to my parents for me to go see a psychiatrist. I showed it to my mom and she scoffed at it, saying that I was pretending and should just speak up at school. I thought nothing of it.\n\nA year later, I found an article about selective mutism. Everything that was written perfectly describes my experience at school so I forwarded it to my mom, thinking she would finally understand me. She replied with \"Stop making things up, u're normal\". So I left it at there and decided that professional help is beyond my reach.\n\nThis brings me to where I am now, and I have in fact not gotten better. It is actually getting worse. In the PTA meetings every year, my mom would get the same feedback. \"She is (still) not speaking in class,\" etc etc. I know my mom is getting tired of it, and I am too. I feel bad. But I do not know what to do. I know from this point on you will get graded for speaking, presentations, etc. It is really hard not getting a diagnosis because you are supposed to be treated earlier on. I was not diagnosed till I was 12. Thankfully my mom knew something was wrong when the teachers told her. Idk what country you are in so idk if you can get a 504 plan for school so they will not give you bad grades for not speaking in presentations and stuff. Also at a certain age you can go to the psychiatrist by yourself maybe a friend could take you or something?

Hi, I do not really know how to put me feelings into words that well or even at all really so I am just going to try my best.\n\nI have always been a quiet and shy person. Every single report I have had since nursery has been about how I am quiet and that I need to speak more at school. Up until somewhere in yr7 I could speak to people at school without y'know feeling as if I could not physically speak to them. There is nothing physically stopping me from speaking but whenever I try to like when I get asked a question in a lesson it feels as if I cannot like, I have no voice. \n\nI do not really have any friends, and my social skills are just fucking poor. The people that I really only talk to is my family. \n\nI do not really understand why I am like this or why I cannot speak to people. A few teachers at school (I am currently in yr10) have tried to get me to speak to them because y'know they are worried about me because my mum mentioned that I get real pissed super easily. \n\nI have never in my life met someone who understands how I feel and I hate myself for being like this. People at school misunderstand it as being real shy or just putting me off as the quiet kid y'know. I hate being alone, I am fed up of doing 3x the work in group assessments because I have to do it alone or it will be real fucking awkward for the both of us.\n\nAnyway, I am glad I could get this out y'know this shit has been brewin for a bit.\n\nHope you all have a good day/night :) Can you make eye contact and say hello to people? That is where I started focusing. I cannot hold eye contact at all it is weirdly really hard to. First of all, I am really impressed that you have the self awareness to be able to see that you have a problem with being quiet and you are looking into selective mutism. I think it is important to remember that SM is a form of social anxiety disorder. In order to get better you need to treat the social anxiety piece.  Does your school have a counselor or social worker you trust? Can your parents help you find a therapist or speech therapist in your community? There are many treatment options, from medication to therapy. I would also recommend the website \"SMart center\" for some basic resources. Please try and be kind to yourself. No one asks for SM, no one deserves it. You are fighting an invisible condition every single day. I think that people with SM are some of the bravest people I know! I am 30 years old and just now recieving treatment for it. Please take advantage of the fact you are still young and you still have school resources to get treatment. Best of luck to you! You are not alone! I feel pretty similar, I was always very shy and did not speak in certain situations but always had a couple of friends. It got way worse for me in high school, to the point of me not speaking much of the time and having no friends. I feel very alone because it seems that not many people understand this, its nice to have someone feel the same but also sad because I would not wish anyone go through this. I would suggest you get help as soon as you can, I know it can be really difficult when you do not speak so much because you might be afraid to try speak to an adult because it may be awkward. If someone brushes you off try to ignore it and speak to someone else until you find someone who can understand a little, in my experience it might take time as not many people will have come across this issue. If you dont get help now its not likely to go away on its own, my biggest regret is not getting the right help sooner. Have you tried the forehead trick? Just staring at someone is forehead gives the illusion of eye contact. It is super over stimulating to me, but I find that people really like receiving it in general (at least in the US). \n\nAny sort of greeting you can manage is a good start, you can always work your way up.\n\nSmiles too. Being a guy in his mid 30's I have been looking for help for the condition as well but it is incredibly hard to find resources for adults or it is incredibly expensive living in a city like NY. \n\nCan you share what treatment is like for you and how it is been going since you started? Mind sharing what kind of help did you end up getting and how effective did you find it to be? It is nice to see a fellow adult on here! (Well, I am not sure I am an adult yet, but you get my point) I will not get on my soapbox about how much health care in the US sucks, especially mental health. I was fortunate enough to get a LPC to do therapy with me. I entered therapy for Complex PTSD and bipolar disorder. I had no clue that SM even existed! It soon became apparent in therapy that something else was going on. I would completely shutdown and be unable to speak. The more I wanted to, the harder it was. This was my norm since I was about 3 years old. I rarely spoke in school, and had weird rules in my head about who I could and could not talk to. I still have them as an adult. I came across a youtube video on kids with SM and my mouth dropped. I showed it to my therapist. Both her and my psychiatrist diagnosed me with SM. Now that therapy is online due to covid, we work on slow, graduated exposure. First we do chat only, video and sound off. Then we work on audio only. There is no pressure or expectations placed on me. We also work on self talk, breathing exercises, and building trust. Working on my SM is intertwined  into my trauma therapy, so it will be an extremely slow process for me. You have an advantage because you already know you have SM. If you have health insurance look to see who their in-network therapists are. You will not find someone who specializes in SM. You can find someone who specializes in social anxiety.  Psychology.com has a search function as well. With covid, many therapists are doing a sliding fee scale if you do not have insurance. You need to do your research and be prepared to advocate for yourself. Unfortunately no one else will do that for you. Be prepared to write out or tell your therapist about SM, what it is, how it affects you, and that it is an anxiety disorder. Provide resources for them. Another route is to go through the SMart center. They have virtual support groups for adults with SM, along with providing diagnostics and therapy. I am so sorry this is so long, I just hope that my struggles could help someone else. Best of luck to you!! Heh no worries about length. I have had trouble finding a therapist who specializes for adults or it is been rediculously expensive. The support group does sound interesting. I am not officially diagnosed I have always thought I had social anxiety but basically after researching sm I realized the symptoms fit me perfectly since childhood. Also it looks like social anxiety and selective mutism go hand in hand.\nGlad to hear that your getting treatment and it sounds like you are getting alot out of it which is great. If there is a way to avoid suffering in literal silence then it is best to do so I feel.", "\"She can talk, but chooses not to.\" I went to a psychiatric hospital once and one of the staff ladies said that, quite angrily, in reference to me. Granted, it happened two years ago, but I still think about it to this day, and it still really hurts.\n\n\"She can talk, but *chooses* not to.\"\n\nA few days after that, another staff lady walked in on me while I was using the bathroom. She knocked first, of course, and I tried to respond but could not get any words out. She ended up opening the door, and I was EXTREMELY embarrassed. Why on earth would I *choose* to let that happen?\n\nAnd recently, I had my first job interview. I practiced for it all day and all night. I really, really did want the job, but I ended up not saying a SINGLE WORD to the interviewer.\n\nWHY would I choose to let THAT happen?\n\nSM has ruined nearly every aspect of my life, and there are people out there who really think it is a choice. That is annoying. I hate that. That really sucks. People just do not get it. I am on this subreddit to try to understand someone close to me who has SM, and I can definitely see your frustration. I think people are just really insensitive because if you do not really know much about SM or anxiety in general and how these things make you feel, then your ignorance will lead you to believe something stupid like \"I can talk no problem, they are just shy and choosing not to\" when it is really not like that.\n\n\nI once saw someone try to explain OCD by using a hypothetical scenario of 'write down \"I wish all my family was dead\" on a piece of paper'. You will not want to because it makes you feel.. weird. You know that reasonably it will not happen because it is just a harmless piece of paper, but there is still something inside you that just tells you not to and makes you feel icky at the thought. I would imagine SM is kind of something like that. Like, yeah, physically, you have vocal chords.. but depending on the situation and the pressure it can just feel so impossible and weird to do that often times you end up just not doing it. I wish there was an easy fix.. but you cannot really reason yourself out of it a condition you did not reason yourself into people say this about me all the time and i HATE it. if i could talk, i would. SM is not a choice and it is not something i enjoy. it is debilitating. it is extremely painful. i really, really wish people would grasp that. \n\nwishing you the best, OP &lt;3 My school councilor said I was \u201chopeless\u201d and there was no way she could \u201chelp\u201d me. How about you stop treating me like there is something wrong with me and treat me like a normal human being? I had something similar happen at the hospital when I was going for an x-ray, the receptionist asked me something and I of course stayed quiet and smiled. Then she said something along the lines of when my dad said I was quiet, \"that will change if she grows up\" implying that I am immature. Simply reading this infuriated me, I do not choose to be like this but that is how they view it. I feel you. School presentations were hell for me and I am sure I have a lot of family members still salty I never spoke to them. I even had a pediatrician angrily walk out on me when I was a kid because I could not talk. It was not my fault - it was both SM and the fact I felt very nauseous and did not want to puke on him. I am sorry that happened to you. Some people are insensitive a holes. I have the same experiences. My teachers always labeled me as \u201cdefiant\u201d even though they would been told multiple times I could not control it. An eye doctor even threatened to have people pin me down to the table because I was not complying. Sometimes I wish this disorder was not called selective mutism because the selective part always sounds like it is a choice. It should be called situational mutism, it sounds less like a choice and more of something that just occurs", "Has anyone tried CBD to treat SM?  I have not tried it specifically for SM but in terms of social anxiety it did not really do much to be honest. I did a LOT of it before having to do something social, was still mostly mute. Do you mean cognitive behavioural therapy? I have not used a whole lot of CBD specifically, but I will say that my life changed dramatically when I started using cannabis. It is obviously anecdotal evidence, but prior to this, despite being in college and living on my own, I barely functioned like a human being. Now I can talk to people and interact with them and have conversations and everything. It is certainly not like it magically cured everything - I still struggle at 26 - but it made a HUGE difference. I tend to go for strains that are high in CBD but have not had enough experience with CBD alone to say whether it helped much. For those who do not live in legal states/are not 21/do not want to do weed, I think it could definitely be worth a try, though. I guess it is something to do with cannabis reading the other comments now, doh! yeah it is cannabidiol, a part of cannabis that may be promising for anxiety and other issues.", "How can I be better for him? I (24f) need help, and I am not looking to be told I am a terrible gf or that I do not understand what my bf (21m) is going through or that I need to be more considerate towards him. His SM has never ever been a problem for me and I hardly ever notice he does not speak tbh because I love him no matter what. \n\nBut recently it is been becoming a problem for me when I catch him whispering to his mom or dad and this sort of frantic jealous rage starts in my stomach. Now I never lash out at him when I see this or make him feel horrible for it because I know he does not do it on purpose and it is his anxiety that is stopping him from ever speaking to me but regardless it is still hard for me. SM does not just effect the person afflicted with it, it also effects the ones around them especially loved ones and I think sometimes people do not understand that.\n\nThis past week we stayed at a coworkers house to help bird sit his birds while he was on vacation and everything was mainly fine, until nighttime when his mom would call and he would hafta run to the bathroom and lock himself up so I could not hear him. Again I never said anything or made him feel bad about it but it is just hard to know that the love of my life needs to hide from me to speak. I guess it is because you do not ever want to feel like your partners afraid of you and that is what it feels like when he needs to go somewhere else to talk on the phone.\n\nOther instances are when I come around the corner and I see him look over at me and immediately stop talking to his mom or dad or when he looks back to see if I am around before speaking to his mom. It just hurts because I know he does not do it on purpose but I do not like the feeling of him needing to hide from me. It is gotten to the point that I try not to go to his house or his dads house with him anymore because I do not want to see him not be able to talk to me. \n\nMy bf is everything I have ever wanted in life and I do not want to accidentally hurt him by saying something negative when these feelings pop up and I defiantly want to move out with him soon but I know I will not be able to until he speaks to me fully. I know it is not me and it has nothing to do with me or how comfortable he is around me but how can I stop feeling these jealous waves when I see him talking or hear stories about him talking to other friends especially when I am supposed to be his life partner. This is not a good place not vent about this.\n\nI was abused by someone who punished and degraded me for not speaking. \n\nYou honestly sound like you have your own issues to sort through. \n\nYour rage is very likely fueling his anxiety around you.  And in consequence he might be even more hesitant to open up to anyone else. well this comment is pretty unfair to me though because I never push or degrade him ever. And i also do not have any rage towards him not speaking to me either ( I should not have used the wording jealous rage because it is more just jealousy.) I would never hurt him or make him feel any less for not speaking to me, I just needed advice on how to not get hurt that he has not spoken to me yet I sincerely do not know what you can do, besides understanding what passes through his mind, but as far as you said you have already had an idea into this. Trying to not put any pressure in making him talking may be important in decrasing his anxiety into talking. However, I think I am not the best person to give you an advice, but ( is worth seeing. Basically, it is a girl with Selective Mutism and her relation with her boyfriend and she never talked with him. I think you have got valid points. You want these feelings to go away, you want your subconscious to catch up to your conscious efforts to accept his SM the way it is. You probably feel very guilty for being jealous.\n\nI cannot say I exactly relate to the predicament, but I would like to at least try to add my thoughts on the matter. I have immersed myself into the community for nearly 2 years now as someone who is not SM themselves but is passionate about connecting people and education. I believe you can conquer those feelings in time by reflecting on them whenever they occur. Continue to study the stories of SMers to maintain your conscious understanding of his reality versus what your subconscious seems to be perceiving. Never forget that you are in control of your actions even if you cannot help your emotions. It never goes well to communicate with the person when you are feeling angry/upset. It is not good to bottle it up either, so perhaps you can talk to someone you trust that can help you sort out your feelings.\n\nFeel free to message me if you would like to talk more or get more sm books/resources. &gt;.

The best advice i can give you is to maybe find good help from someone who specializes in SM. Someone who can work work with him, and perhaps work with both of you, starting with small steps.  Good luck!", "Dunno if this is SM but... Sorry, this is going to be pretty long. :/\n\nHi all, I am a 26 yo trans woman. I have been having a harder and harder time talking for about a year and a half now. My voice was always an enormous point of dysphoria for me. Over the last 6 months I got super into voice training to make my deep, gravely voice more feminine. I did this whenever I got some privacy, but I would work it until it hurt. Then I kept at it until nothing would come out. But I was never satisfied and I kept pushing it and pushing it. The irony is I found myself clamming up in public more and more. \n\nAt first it was whenever I had to use a public restroom, I am always *terrified* of using the women\u2019s bathroom. I always kept my head down and I never *ever* talk if anyone addresses me, I just nodded or shook my head and did my business and left. Then the grocery store, whenever a clerk tried to ask me anything, ask how I was doing, I smiled awkwardly and avoided eye contact. Now towards the end of October I completely trashed my voice at work and I sound worse than ever. Hours of struggling and straining to sound like the woman am, talking myself hoarse and killing my vocal cords finally caught up to me and even attempting a feminine voice is painful, but if I ever hear my voice even going near a masculine register I contemplate self harm. I have been clean nearing two years now  but it kills me if I or anyone else hears my voice. \n\nMy job used to involve me talking a lot, but work heard my voice and keeps me in positions where I do not have to talk much. It is been weeks now and I cannot seem to get anything to come out when I want to, all I get is a hoarse, falsetto-like whisper that embarrasses me back into silence. Attempts at voice training cause pain and shame. \n\nI am going to have a one on one with my therapist, who for a while now I have been seeing in a group setting. I can talk okay if it is one on one, but I have to be gentle with my voice, and not scare myself into silence. So, I suppose I am mostly wondering, is this selective mutism? Is the anxiety I experience like a clamping around my throat when I try to talk anything similar? I want to bring it up to my therapist and it would help to put a name to a face, you know? Thanks for reading up til now! I dunno for sure but it sounds like a mixture of SM and anxiety. Also do not worry about pushing yourself, you should go at your own pace! Never feel ashamed to be who you are, everything will come in time. Thank you for the kind reply! It sounds like you have a difficult relationship with your body, the way you body produces sound to be specific, but I do not really think that is really at the core of most cases of SM. Selective mutism involves extreme social anxiety, where a person's vocal chords freeze up due to said anxiety. So their body is literally incapable of speech some of the time. \n\nObviously I am not an expert nor can any of us diagnose you, it is just my two cents. Most cases of SM you hear about in this sub follow the same general narrative, it started when they were really young, they might not even remember not having lived that way. Sometimes it gets progressively worse over time. \n\nThis disorder is associated with children, although many sufferers struggle up until they are adults (like I myself did), because it usually starts ages 2-4!\n\nI have subscribed to this sub for a while and had not heard of a case of adult onset SM. \n\nNot sure if you are already aware but I have heard of other cases of trans people struggling with the sound of their voice, it is not an uncommon experience, from what I have personally seen, although I am not an expert in the topic. Yeah, I feel the same. I honestly think it is voice dysphoria in the extreme but I have not been able to find a lot of other trans people\u2019s experience with not being able to talk *at all* in most situations like myself. I am seeing a doc soon but I do not think there is really anything physically wrong with me other than lots of vocal abuse. Thank you for your input! Sorry it took me so long to reply, but one clue could be the state of your vocal chords or maybe it is better to say your throat. I remember my throat used to ache kind of like when you get a cold, except the wear was all from my anxiety, like from my vocal chords tensing up. It could not have been over practice, I never talked! The most common narrative for SM is that sometimes little kids that are facing the world for the first time are not able to handle new environments and go mute from the anxiety, but like I mentioned before, trauma can also make people so tense they cannot speak. In your case, facing your environment with a voice you are not comfortable with might also be provoking high anxiety and the same shutting down of your vocal chords. I am only speculating, I have never heard anyone explicitly say the latter two groups are people who can develop SM, although other people might know more about different presentations of it... I know you said you wear your voice out from voice training, but if you pay attention to the way your throat feels when you have not been overusing it, if you notice you are still experiencing aches, that might mean it is an atypical case of SM... No worries, thanks for taking the time to reply! The thing is, I only trained my voice when I had privacy. I sounded okay when by myself, but I was not able to use it when I was out grocery shopping or something. It just came out like a weird whisper when I tried and only made me feel worse. \n\nI have not talked outside of work or my home in years. I worked my voice specifically so I could use it at my job (I am a barista). Recently, was told I have a medical condition that makes it very raspy and hoarse. My cords are physically damaged and swollen, so now I have stopped speaking all together. Currently the only situations I can speak are with medical professionals in a quiet room (I cannot raise my voice at all, it does not really come out anymore).\n\nAnxiety has always been a huge problem, but I sort of ignored it because I was so focused on my transition. It spiraled out of control and I am working with my psychologist (whom I have been seeing since pre-transition) to help me work through it. After talking with her recently she did end up diagnosing me with SM (to my surprise). \n\nThanks again. :)", "Speaking when I do not want to speak and fighting my SM is making my SM worse I do not know how to cope Just do not give af, think about what your going to say, think of the reactions to it, &amp; speak! (\n\nexposures should be outside your comfort zone in order for you to grow and learn from the experience. After a certain threshold, the anxiety level a task induces can backfire on you and hinder your progress, and that is the panic zone. If you are not growing then I think you need to find ways to help you go back to learning level exposures. Don\u00b4t put too much pressure on yourself. It may be hard at the start, but going slowly may help. If the environment you\u00b4re inserted doesn\u00b4t help and makes you too anxious, changing and trying to talk in other situations can be a blessing. Try to look for a place where you usually don\u00b4t speak much and say something, like a 'Hello', 'Good Morning' or try to reply with more words than usual to a question. If the things are going really bad for you, slow down, take a step back (but not too back) and when you feel you\u00b4re ready try small steps. My panic attacks from trying to do this are escalating. \nI do not recommend.\nI have no further advice, just that it will either get better (like others say), or much worse (like im currently pushing myself toward).", "5 yo speaks for first time I had to gush about this, my son has a friend with selective mutism in his class, and we had the friend over for a playdate last week. My son can be socially immature so sometimes does not get along with the other older rough-and-tumble types in his class, but he is silly and loving and really just wants a friend to call his own.  Well, as far as I know, the little boy has never spoken aloud to anyone at school-- not to me or the teacher or any other kid outside of family.  I volunteer in class so I could see he was very smart, silly, and sweet. My son started recently telling me that the boy whispers things to him from time to time. So we had them over to see how it might go.   \n\nWell, after about an hour of play while the mom and I chatted and sat outside, we heard the boys running and laughing inside the house, and then what do you know, the boy started talking to my son, aloud. I could tell the mom was surprised, and she said he has NEVER spoken aloud outside family, but I could also tell she did not want to be overly reactionary- we were just getting acquainted, and I am sure that she did not want to make more of a deal of it than she needed to. But then as the day went on, he started taking in front of and to my daughter as well, and then in front of me too (but not directly to me). We took a walk to the park nearby, and the boy just kept on talking to my son, daughter and his sister- even in front of a few other people! \n\nIt felt miraculous, and I do not believe in that kind of thing.  I am just thankful if we had any part in it, and hope above all that this starts him on a path of gaining confidence enough to speak more.  I told the mom that I think every kid just needs a friend- just one is enough, and perhaps he is found it.  My son was so proud as well, by the way... to have a buddy, and to be the only one who the boy has ever spoken to outside of family.  ", "My parents do not understand I was diagnosed with SM a few years back and the way my parents went about fixing it was isolating me from the outside world by grounding me from things like my phone and computer or just from going outside in general (which is already hard enough) periodically. I am constantly yelled at and attacked in arguements, \"Why do you choose to ignore me.\" The only person I can talk to is my gf who is 3,000 miles away currently and I am lost at what to do. I have SM and can probably relate at least a Little)  \n\ndo your parents know that you have SM and you are not choosing to ignore them?\n And isolating you from people honestly Is the worst possible way to try to help you. Honestly your parents sound terrible Yes they know about it... They are actually the cause of it when I was younger, about 5. My parents and the stress they put on me are also the cause when they got divorced when i was 9. My parents do not even know if I really have it or anyone at my school. I can talk about half the time but about 65% of the time I cannot say what I am thinking and have to try to say something else or try to say difr and words. And I cannot call ppl on the phone or order at fast food drive thru's at all. I would try to talk to them about getting a therapist to try to help. Or at least try to tell your parents you are not Ignoring them or does not really matter what they think really. I would recommend try not to think about talking if you can Ummm... I cant... Talk to them or communicate to them in any way... I would prefer my parents to be divorced but i think my little sisters are holding my mom back from leaving my dad... Text ? They would confront me with whatever I told them... I tried that before... I even tried it once while visiting my gf in AZ... I was there for a few weeks... You told them you have selective mutism and that you are not ignoring them you just cannot talk in select situations and that is why you text them,\n  Instead of doing it in person And are you able to talk to other people besides your parents ? Like close friends? And how often does it happen. Just my gf and all the time otherwise Yes, sounds about right... Goes in one ear and out the other, they honestly think im faling it half the time... We will get into arguements through text while im at school sometimes but that is about it... I am relatively new to this sub but it is so relieving to be able to know that I am not the only one struggling with it. I have only ordered food in a drive-thru once or twice in my life. I can do it face to face like 93% of the time but at the drive thru I have been able to do it 3 out of like 20 times.  And I cannot talk over the phone. I honestly hate hearing other people have to go through this and some worse than me.  This is the biggest thing keeping me from my dream job and having friends", "SM and homeschool My almost 5 year old daughter is exhibiting symptoms of SM. She refuses to greet anyone. She will spontaneously speak to children in small groups, but sometimes will not answer their questions. \n\nI see that her refusal to speak sparks aggression in other children. For example: I have seen a girl violently throw a pile of leaves at her for not answering her requests to play, one girl had a full blown tantrum when she did not respond and even one of her close friends started aggressively hounding her when she did not say \u201cyou are welcome.\u201d For this reason, I am considering homeschooling combined with lots of group activities in the homeschool community and beyond. \n\nI fear that some people will see my decision as the cause rather than the response to her condition. \n\nI want to ask this community for feedback. Did facing your fears improve your SM or make it worse? Do you feel being in large school groups helped or hindered your condition.\n\nThank you Facing fears has helped me get over it, but it must be done slowly. I have a 4 year old son who been diagnosed with selective mutism and was in a pre-K however he did not speak to his teachers or students but would participate in activities. It was not until after another little kid join the classroom when his anxiety would kick in as this kid would apparently pick on him. We pulled him out. Unfortunately we live in Ohio where there are not any SM specialists and his case is further complicated by a OCNDS diagnosis as well. We are hoping to get reassigned to NJ as we have found a provider there who treats SM and we are going to try and get into CHOP as well. At home, he speaks no more than 1-2 sentences when having a conversation with us. It is difficult to sometimes figure out what he wants or if he is in pain as he cannot really communicate with us. The specialist who evaluated him recommended a school with a developmental program. So we are hoping to find one that will work out. I had SM all throughout elementary school. I honestly do not know what I would have been like if I did not have the experience of coming to school everyday. Although at times I felt so anxious I just wanted to fall off the face of the earth, at the end of the day, my teachers were understanding and they never forced me to do anything I did not feel comfortable with. I never experienced any bullying and I could comfortably play with my classmates (silently of course, and they did not even question it). Maybe I was just lucky, but I have incredibly fond memories at school. I think that being put into a normal setting with other kids helped me observe them and learn how to behave around others.  Pulling her out of school will probably just make the problem worse. I was diagnosed when I was 8 and I started seeing a specialist. I was put on medication which helped immensely. I started talking to my father once I was put on medication. Aside from medication, I also saw a psychiatrist for cognitive behavioral therapy. In therapy we took incremental steps facing my fears; starting with making eye contact and working up to talking to my classmates. It was facing these fears directly that helped ease my anxiety over time and eventually I was able to talk to people without anxiety and I no longer needed medication. \n\nSelective mutism is an anxiety disorder and the worst thing you can do for an anxiety disorder is avoidance. Avoiding a stimuli that causes anxiety only increases your fear of that stimuli over time because you are unable to develop the necessary coping skills. If she gets taken out of school now, she may feel better in the short term but in the long term if she ever wants to go back to school it will most likely cause her extreme anxiety. Staying in school gives her a good space to practice the skills she works on in treatment and prevents any increase in anxiety over school social settings.  I told a young man who is dealing with SM this story today....\n\nMy 9 yr old dd who has SM participates in a competition every year where she has to do a 30 second personal introduction. First year, she froze up and ran off crying. Last year, she had a complete melt down before hand and said she just wanted to go home. We went through all of the possible outcomes with her.... We told her that the time doesnt start until she starts talking so stand there as long as she had to to feel more comfortable. If she messes up, who is going to know??? Only her!!  After getting her settled, she said she wanted to push through. She completed her intro but it was very whispery in the microphone. Now THIS YEAR, she walked out with her head held high, grabbed the mic and absolutely KILLED her intro. \n\nDue to this competition, she was able to read her award winning essay to about 7 news crews and a bunch of people in attendance when she accepted her award. \n\nI say this to show that getting out of your comfort zone as someone with SM is doable and it can help. It definitely hard seeing your child struggle with social interactions. I would start with seeking out therapy, get her a formal diagnosis, and get a 504/IEP plan going. It is going to be a long road ahead, but to see your child grow more confident every day is so rewarding.  Same. Facing fears is the only way I know of to overcome it. It is a slow and difficult process but it was worth it for me! I had severe selective mutism and I was homeschooled. It definitely cut way down on the stress/social trauma that I no doubt would have experienced in public school. I did end up overcoming Selective Mutism when I was 13. Feel free to ask me anything about SM/homeschooling. Good Luck!", "Video chatting with the class Just a mute button, right?\nI can just turn the camera off, right?\nI am thinking too much, right?\nI can just talk to them about it?\nWill they understand?\nAm I being too much by feeling I am nothing at all?\nShould I give myself a chance?\n                            - _Chat spiral_ \u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nNot going to lie, I did not do the meeting the other day. But, I have another chance today. I have another chance today. I have another chance to take one small step forward and I will take it. I am trying to straighten the spiral rather than spin endlessly as the day slips between my fingers. I am trying to grab my time as tight as I can. So yes, I will answer the call. I will take one step forward no matter what. Even if I take five steps back. Progress is progress. For me, turning off the mic and camera when I start slipping really helps. I never participate much anyway, and it is unlikely many people are watching someone that is not speaking, but it helps to be able to still be present but be kind of incognito until I feel better. \n\nI am glad you are considering giving it another go. It is difficult, but you have complete control. And when it does not feel like you do, just turn off the camera and mic to remind yourself that you do!\n\nYou can do this! Thank you so much for the advice and encouragement! I really appreciate it and it makes me feel a bit less alone :) Is having mic and camera on required? In my school we do not need to have mic on often, and camera, never.", "Does selective mutism just mean not talking during times that you want to and related to anxiety? Or can it also mean sometimes you just dont talk? Am wanting to learn more about what its like and what it means. There are some times where I want to talk but just cant (mainly in large gathering where I feel like I should talk, or in emotional/situations where I am getting yelled at), but most of the time there isnt that urgent feeling, I just do not talk. I have noticed before there would be days (pre pandemic) where I just wouldnt talk to anyone until I got home besides maybe some hellos. I even had a teacher call on me one time and another student got mad at them for it, saying I dont talk so why would they call on me before I even had a chance to do anything. This may be just me being quiet, but I didnt know if other people experienced this. I personally cannot give my own answer, but here is the answer to a similar question I asked a while ago, if it helps:\n\nMe:\n\n  &gt;  \"Is there a place or something where I can find the line between being silent and being a selective mute? I rarely talk, but I have no idea how far to place myself.\"\n\nAnswerer:\n\n  &gt;  \"I am not exactly sure where to draw the line, or if there even is a clear line. Psychiatry as a whole is very muddled without clear boundaries, and selective mutism is one of the less well known disorders.\n\nI grew up with it (not officially diagnosed) and it was not just that I rarely spoke in some situations, it is that I was physically unable to. I could have something I wanted to say, and the perfect opportunity to say it, but it was like the connection from my brain to my mouth was severed. There was absolutely nothing I could do to get words out of my mouth.\"\n\nIn my opinion I think you can somewhat start calling it mutism when you literally cannot talk or when you freeze up, like when you suddenly cannot say anything when someone asks your age, if you know what I mean. I still have no idea, so sorry for the indirect answer &gt;most of the time there isnt that urgent feeling, I just do not talk.\n\nSame for me!\n\nI am pretty sure that is part of the disorder though. Just cause it is an anxiety disorder, it does not mean you have to experience full-blown panic to not talk. Remember that avoidance (= not talking) actually lowers the amount of anxiety you feel. \n\nI am pretty sure that is what happened to me. It always felt like I _could_ talk if I wanted to, but that would then cause me anxiety. Not talking felt less stressful, so I would stick with that. It does not have to happen on a conscious level though.\n\nEdit: I definitely should have made it clear that this was my experience as a child. Now I am an adult and do not have SM anymore - if I ever had it in the first place. Well, if you feel like you could talk of you wanted to, then i dont think sm is the proper term for it.\n\nFor people with sm, talking is not an option. Im not saying they need to have a full blown panic attack. Speaking would cause them so much anxiety that they cant even start to do it.\n\n Maybe you had sm in the past, but if talking is an option and you choose not to do it (which i relate to, and I *used* to have sm), then maybe you have some sort of social anxiety. It is different from being shy or silent. The reason you are so silent is because you cannot talk. It is physically impossible for you to produce sound  so you just keep to yourself. You cannot say hi or answer a question. You might be able to mumble a word or two but very poorly. Selectively mute is not really selective. Your body goes mute for you in selective places but those places always tend to be anywhere that is not home.\n\nIf you are selectively mute, speaking should be extremely difficult, and if you really tried to speak even through your condition, it should cause pain. At one point, I even lost the ability to speak to my own family, only managing to mumble. I do not freeze up when confronted to speak, I just stand there with a straight face and mouth out the words I want to say and avoid as much social contact if possible. It sounds like you could have social anxiety and it might be inhibiting you to the point it could cause you to think something worse. I used to think I had autism or Aspergers; but I do not, I just had selective mutism. It is likely not everyone is experience is exactly the same. I would say using silence as an avoidance strategy for social anxiety is still Selective Mutism. Since we are not doctors, let us err on the side of inclusivity. It can make people feel pretty bad if we start telling them they do not actually have SM when they probably do, so let us be careful. &gt;if you feel like you could talk of you wanted to\n\nIt is similar jumping off a cliff. You might feel like you can jump off a cliff without being scared when you think about it as a distant thing. But if you go near the edge of a cliff your feet would freeze. Sometimes you feel like you can do things that you actually cannot. I dont think that applies in the case of the person I replied to. If she is specifically saying she could talk if she wanted to, then id interpret that as her being confident enough to start talking, but choosing not to because she does not like to feel the anxiety. In my own opinion i think this specific situation should not be called selective mutism, but rather a serious social anxiety.\n\nI am saying this because she is technically making a choice not to speak. I would say that selective mutism is when you are not making a choice. It is when you cannot speak even if you wanted to.\n\nAlso, I am just talking about my opinion on the definitions here. I am not saying she does not deserve the same treatment as those with SM. Whether you are making a  choice not to speak or your anxiety forces you not to speak, heavy anxiety is still involved. I am just talking about my opinion on the definition of sm. If someone technically does not have SM by my definition but uses silence to avoid anxiety, they still deserve and require the same things people with SM need.\n\nIf someone feels bad cause by my definition they are not in the same group as people with SM, then let it be known that they absolutely are in that same group and should get the same treatment. We cannot really know what is really up with them. Maybe they really choose not to speak or may be they think that they are choosing not to speak (but that choice is a illusion when they actually try to speak) after being too comfortable with years of avoidance or some other reason. I understand what you are saying completely. I think the problem is that people are taking the word, \u201cselective\u201d in Selective Mutism too literally. When in fact it is not selective at all. This is causing people who have social anxiety to have trouble making the distinction between the two and are self diagnosing themselves with the wrong condition. It is an incredibly weird and rare disorder that cannot fully be understood by anyone who does not actually have it in its purest extent. Yeah, I probably got a little excessively worried there.  All the same, I appreciate you making these comments in response. Yeah, I definitely see where you are coming from. I did not know self-diagnosis was a problem, since people usually have no clue what SM is, but I can see that happening if they have found this subbreddit. Though I got the feeling the commenter really did have SM, but maybe misspoke in a way that made some people suspicious. Sometimes I just cannot speak at all. I want to speak a lot of the time but I cannot because of selective mutism. I get what you are saying. I am not too sure about it myself tbh.\n\nMaybe I should have included this in the original comment: I was talking about my experiences as a child. I do not have SM anymore, so I can only tell from memory. That makes it quite hard to be sure.\n\nI remember that in kindergarten, speaking was not even an option that occured to me. In school, my SM was kind of getting better. Those memories are quite clear, and I remember my thought process being something like \"I could speak now, but it would really be a big effort. I would rather stay quiet\". So it is possible that I did not have SM at that point anymore. But I would also like to say that this was not really a conscious choice. I did not literally think this, it was more of an automatic avoidance of the stress that speaking would cause me. Not sure if that changes anything. \n\n(My mom also said that I would sometimes not speak on purpose when I did not like someone. She said is was possible to tell the difference. But this is also just based on her memory, so idk.) In my opinion, SM is not all about speech like the term suggests. Going mute is the result of an extreme anxiety that called SM. Yes, I am going mute when my head telling me\u201d just said hi\u201d; other times I decide not to talk to avoid that anxiety.  \u201c Selective mutism\u201d is not telling people that my whole body is paralyzed, not only my mouth.", "Accommodations for selective mutism in college I decided to go back to school and applied for disability services. My accommodations that were not related to SM were approved, but the ones that I need the most for it were not listed. Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have any advice? In some cases, you can find lists of what accommodations are possible (or most likely), but what you are going to want to do is talk with the person in charge of your accommodations. If you have a hard time talking in person in that situation, bring a friend who is willing to advocate for you when you cannot, or send them an email. Explain how it affects you and why those things would help more than what was approved. I was pretty much told there is nothing they can do about it. I have to personally ask professors for alternative assignments through email instead of presentations (Usually ends up being long papers. Sometimes I just have to take a 0). And for group work days I just leave. My participation grade is pretty much always low. Just got to work hard in other areas to make up for it.\n\nMy best recommendation if you cannot get accomodations is to pre-write up an explanation of how you do things and what makes you comfortable and just insert each professor's name when it comes time to send it to them. Mine is usually something like:\n\nMy name is X and I currently struggle with (insert my disabilities). Give a brief explanation of how that affects me and ask if there is anything they are willing to work with me on in order to be a satisfactory student with them. Some of them only work with the accommodations I am officially given (unrelated to sm), and others are much nicer and are willing to work with me through it.\n\nJust remember that they are not legally required to provide you with any sort of accommodations outside of what is officially agreed upon by disability services. Any outside of that are just them being nice and it should not be taken advantage of. But also keep in mind that they are human, and understand that circumstances do not always allow for individuals to get the help that they need specifically.\n\nI would say 9 times out of 10 I get a professor that is really cool about it and are willing to go the extra mile. The one that is not I usually just swap the class out during the 1st week grace period. If it is a class that I absolutely need, I just ask them to meet me in the middle and not call on me during class. That is usually fine.", "2020 selective mutism subreddit survey results are out! We had **239** responses on this survey. You can see the summary of results below. What are your thoughts?\n\n\n\nI have recently created a ( page to keep a record of these surveys and other major subreddit events.\n\n\n---\n\n( Thank you for your work with putting this all together. It is interesting to me how many people are diagnosed at different ages, but mostly around the time of when kids begin school. I also found it interesting that many people have diagnosed themselves. Thanks again. There are a lot of interesting variations in it. I have not sat down to go through all of it myself but it is cool to have these numerical suggestions about what I suspected was true. I did not partake in the survey. I recently joined. My daughter (4) was recently diagnosed with SM and I am trying to find as much info on it as I can. Anything we (my husband and I) can do to help her, we want to do. I am trying to learn as much as I can and I am so surprised that schools are so unfamiliar with SM. Did you already have a look at the wiki?  \n\nIt was put together over months and months of actively gathering links together. Lots of excellent stuff in there No, I have not. I did not know about any of this until recently. Thank you very much and I am going to go look there now. I might even suggest to my daughter's teacher that it might be useful for her, too.  Thank you again. If you look under Highlights, there are sections for parents and for professionals/teachers that are particularly tailored. No problem! There is so much info!! I cannot thank you enough. I have been printing out pretty much everything to send to school tomorrow in my daughter's booksack. Thank you!! I really appreciate it.   Thank you for the effort you put in doing this survey and managing the discord server and this subreddit.\n\n Also, now I remembered of a character in 'Little Witch Academia' called Constanze and I think she has SM, because she only nodded and pointed when she had to say something and she only said something in the last scene of the show. appreciate your input too. I have watched that show and I think you are right. I do not know if it qualifies as representation enough just to have a character who does not talk though, hm. It is like classifying Mr Bean as selective mute but I do not think it is very representative. Ah, I was not aware that there was a survey. Wish I could of answered it lol That is a good point I was surprised to see that being physically limited also goes with SM. I thought I was the only one. It makes sense after the fact does not it? Knowing that speech is just one of many aspects affected by anxiety. The physical aspect would be the \"freeze\" response, vocally and potentially everywhere else. Exactly. I always thought the freeze response only happened during my panic attacks until I realized that I also freeze up outside of the panic disorder. It is all just anxiety at the end of the day so I am not quite sure why I did not associate the two", "I suffered from SM most of my life, and I only just realized what it was. I want to start out by saying that because I was never brought to a therapist when I struggled with SM, I have never been officially diagnosed. But I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that I had it. I have, however, been diagnosed with severe social phobia and agoraphobia and have had panic attacks since I was very young.\n\nI am currently 25 years old and while I am now almost completely recovered, I spent the majority of my life (until I was around 22) almost completely incapable of speaking to anyone but immediate family members and a very very small group of friends. \n\nIt started before I can even remember, my mom told me that even when I was 2 and 3 I would refuse to communicate with anyone I was not familiar with. It only got worse as I got older. My mom spoke with multiple pediatricians and they always told her the same thing. I was just \u201cpainfully shy\u201d and I would grow out of it, she needed to encourage me to \u201cuse my voice\u201d and refuse to speak for me, it would go away as I built confidence. That obviously never worked though. \n\nWhen I was in school I would do anything I could to avoid speaking or having attention drawn to me. I had several accidents in elementary school because I could not bring myself to ask to use the restroom.\n\nWe would be at a restaurant and I would try to tell my mom what I wanted. She would give me the \u201cuse your voice\u201d prompt, and it always went the same way. I would open my mouth to say something and nothing would come out, I really really tried but it was always like the words got caught it my chest and refused to come out. Every time I eventually started to tear up because I really did want to speak for myself but I just could not. My mom would end up ordering for me and more often than not she would snap at me for not just telling them myself. \n\nThe thing is, I never even thought about selective mutism. I had never looked into it and assumed it meant that you just did not want to talk to some people, so you did not. I physically could not do it. After I looked into it I realized that this had been my problem all along, and I cannot help but feel angry. I am not really mad at my mom, she just did what she was told she should do by multiple medical professionals. \n\nI am mad at the doctors who never recommended therapy. I am mad at my teachers for not realizing that there was a problem and telling my parents that I was \u201cmanipulative\u201d and \u201cattention seeking\u201d.  I am mad because instead of getting the help that I needed, I was just told to \u201cSpeak up\u201d.  I am mad because I had to drop out of high school at 15 because I could not handle it. I am mad because I never even had a chance to have a normal life because everyone in my life was so convinced that I was just shy or stubborn or attention seeking that they never even tried to see what the problem was.\n\nI never went through any kind of treatment. When I was nineteen I forced myself to get a customer service job, and with a lot of patience from my coworkers, I slowly started getting more  comfortable communicating with others.\n\nLike I said, I am now for the most part recovered. I still have moments where I struggle to get words out and I cannot do small talk or keep a conversation going if I do not know you well, but I can order my own food. I can go out in public alone. I am happy now. But it is hard not to be resentful.", "do i have SM? it is sm or just regular anxiety? i am currently 14 years old and i remember i was like this ever since i was younger, i was never able to make friends because i did not speak to anyone, i was only able to gesture at things and over the years it is brought my grades down due to lack of participation and initiative. i just brushed it off as me being shy. there is some days where i am able to say the basic \u2018yes\u2019 \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018i do not know\u2019 to a classmate, there is also other days where i am able to say a sentence or two, but some days i cannot talk at all. sometimes i want to answer a question in class but my mouth is glued shut and my body is paralysed. the only person i am talkative around &amp; able to talk to is my friend from school, there is a few other people, but i have different comfortability levels with them, with my friend i blurt out everything and i talk non stop, with some people i am able to say a sentence or two and with others i do not talk at all, even if they ask me a question that requires a longer answer. but i am not even able to talk with my family members or other adults at all, even whenever i was a child, the teacher would ask me something and i would not be able to use words to reply. i am only able to use gestures with my mum like nodding my head or pointing or humming \u2018mhm\u2019, sometimes she pesters me until i say \u2018yes\u2019 \u2018no\u2019 \u2018i do not know\u2019 but i have not had an actual conversation with back and forth talk with her in months? but whenever i get picked on in class to answer a question, i am able to answer, not perfectly, but most of the time i end up saying \u2018i do not know\u2019 even if i know the answer because i just do not really want to talk, but it does not happen every time, sometimes i am able to answer the question but nobody hears what i am saying so i have to keep repeating myself. it is what is making me doubt that i have sm because i read somewhere that people with sm are not able to reply in these situations at all.\n\ni am sorry for this long post, but i want to make sure that i might have it before i bring it up to my mum and maybe get a diagnosis.

Online work can be a good option but she can totally do a real life job. Even if she stumbles, she has to go through a period where she struggles for things to get better. i have heard of people doing shelving/stocking or delivery. Maybe she could be a cook. Cooks dont have to talk much She could try selling on ebay. An easy way to start would just be to sell items that she does not need anymore. Another option would be to buy items (clothes are always a good bet) from a thrift store, discount stores, Goodwill, etc. and sell them at a higher price (i.e. buying and selling). If she does do this, she would not have to speak, as all interaction with customers is online through text. The main kind of outside interaction she would have to deal is going to the post office if she does not have a personal mailbox or the items are too big to fit inside of them. If she does decide to sell online, she would just need to buy a postal scale for shipping items. But shipping envelopes and boxes are free from the USPS. For someone who has dealt with SM for majority of their life, any food service work that does not require you to talk that much (dishwasher or even prep work) are great. \n\nDoing stock at retail stores or supermarkets. \n\nOnline jobs or selling things online. \n\nOvernight shifts are great too because less people. I would recommend any sort of night work is the best. \n\n\n\n It depends on your city's culture, honestly.

Hello /r/selectivemutism,\n\nDuring therapy, some memories were uncovered that did not help my already anxiety filled brain, and as if there was an overload, I became scared to talk.

I do not have the luxury of my roommates being helpful, they are more irritated I do not talk and wish I would just \"get over it.\"\n\nIs there a text-to-speech phone call app anyone can recommend?  Also is there a process that anyone can recommend that would allow me to add mutism to my social security so I could potentially get a device that would help with calls?\n\nI do not know where to begin, all I know is this is frustrating, I was quiet when I was young, broke out of it in my teenage years, was quiet again in my 20s, and now I am 30 years old and non-verbal.

I hope it gets better for you but in the meanwhile for phone calls, are you on apple or android? Android.  Sorry.  I should have mentioned it.  Thank you for the well wishes. Well in that case, go to the default phone app and click the three dots in the upper right hand corner and you should find an option called \"rtt\" (real time text) it allows the person on the receiving end of the call to see what you type as you type it. Does that work when calling places like pharmacies and such? My most important worry is not being able to get my meds (I work off 90 day supplies.) and some meds are coming up ready for refill. That really depends on what they are answering tour call with. However if it is not a computer or cell phone it will not work. You might be able to use something like textmagic to send a text to speech message to someone but it isnt real time so you would have to type everything out before hand and click send. Otherwise you might want to look into support for tty or trs which is pretty much only text back and forth but real time. Thanks.  I will look into those.  I appreciate the answer. No problem i totally get it. I remember using ip-relay.com in the past to make phone calls.  It they are no longer in service due to some sort of FCC issue. However I found this \nI think you type a phone number and type what you want to say and someone dictates both sides of the conversation to you. I have never used the Sprint version before. Can you fax them your message? I ended up using the sprint ip relay linked in the other comment, it worked well after I sent them my documents.  No talking necessary, and it is like using a TTY.\n\nThank you though. I forgot to thank you for this, I signed up and it worked great for talking to my pharmacists.  Thank you. Great!

So I handed it to him and after reading over it, he says that SM is not a diagnosable condition????? He said its some behavioural thing but cannot be diagnosed?? Boi, if that is the case then why is it LITERALLY in the DSM-5??? ITS DIAGNOSABLE!! \n\nHe then insisted that I had GAD instead. That Is it. No advice on how to handle my anxiety, no meds, no tips, didnt even write it down, no ANYTHING. My dad came in the room after and asked him for some advice like \"well what can we do? How should she practice talking?\" and he just says \"sorry I cant do anything. She has to fix herself first\". Like okay, even if u dont know about SM you could at least give me advice on how to handle my anxiety if I had GAD?? He did not offer even ONE ATOM of advice for my anxiety.\n\nHe then says to come back in September when *I am* ready to talk, and that I HAVE TO MAKE THE PHONE CALL TO HIM MYSELF (INSTEAD OF MY PARENTS CALLING)?? Like sheesh I am here because I CANT DO THAT AND I NEED HELP TALKING!!!! I just do not understand him!!\n\nAlso he did not refer me to someone else either because \"nobody can treat me if I keep acting like this\" Oh my god that sounds absolutely awful! I am so sorry you had that experience. What a complete asshole, how did they even get to where they are with that attitude and complete lack of empathy?! I hope the experience has not knocked you too much, I know it must have been difficult for you in the first place. Seems like you just had the worst luck with the person you got, do not beat yourself up about it. The thing with getting help is trying to find the one who fits your needs which is extra difficult when you have SM or social anxiety. My advice is to try again when you are ready with someone else. I hope your family is supportive. Sending you hugs. What a useless asshole honestly. Not to get too psychologically judgemental but I feel like some people go into mental health fields because they just loooove the idea of helping and healing people. They go to school and learn all the technical details of pharmacology and diagnosable conditions; then they actually encounter real people with real struggles and they are lost. \n\n&gt;What do you mean my textbook outlined treatment is not working with this patient? It is *the treatment*. It must be their fault, they are too quiet, they are too obsinate, they are too lazy. \n\nYou can see by how he gets hung up on whether SM is a 'diagnosable' condition (of course it is). As if a living person's experience must conform to what it says in some fucking book. The book is for attempting to describe people, not the other way around, trying to jam actual human beings into simplified categories. Disgusting This guy sucks at his job and I am sorry you had to go through that. fax. Had lots of experiences like this to be honest. So many people in mental health fields suck at their jobs, honestly horrifying especially in cases where someone is mental health/disabilities make it difficult for them to advocate for themself Find another therapist. It is literally his job to **listen to you** and **help you,** not whine about how your problems do not fit his expectations. \n\nProblems with SM aside, it is a bad sign he was so insensitive and kept talking over you even when he thought you might have GAD. What a douche :P Ditch that guy, it sounds like he actually hurt you. I wish I could recommend my psych doc, but you likely do not live here..\n\n\nI had a somewhat 'opposite' experience. I was going to a univ hospital but changed to a closer private practice (here you can go to any doctor of your choosing, and appointment is not needed in most cases. This only applies to tier 1 medical clinics tjough - tier 3 *requires* reference (like university hospitals))\n\n\n\nWhen I first met my current doc, *I* was like your doctor behavior-wise, just from a patient's perspective. I gave her my prescription list and said I only needed the meds and nothing else (for me talking was bs, and you know..SM). I was expecting the doctor to be all okay heres your prescription byeee cuz from my experience, usually this kind of patient would make the doc happy. No time-consuming, just pay and leave. Who would not like that?\n\n\nShe just stared at me for a moment, then said that this was a 'talking therapy' clinic and told me to go elsewhere if I only wanted meds. I was all confused like haha...what? I do not need talking, just meds. She said we should *at least* sit in silence, that it is also a way of communication. So I did. Went back home and complained to mom that this doc was weird lol\n\n\n\nAnd a couple years later, I now meet my doc almost every day. Something happened that made me have a breakdown in front of her, and she handled it very well.\n\n\nChoose a doctor like this, who actually cares about their patients. Sorry for the long story, I have been sitting in a ljbrary all day and needed an excuse for break What an absolute idiot. I feel so sorry for you to have to put up with that stupid man. My advice is to find another therapist, talk to your dad or write him a note because your therapist clearly does not understand and is not interested whatsoever.\n\nIf your from england I know that you can get free councelling via a doctors reffural or self reffural through NHS councelling and CAMHS. If your from other country id suggest going on a crisis chat or text line because these people listen and most are free and doesnt charge costs. \n\nChild line is a great one if your from uk \n\nI hope this helps a little! Nothing worse than a bad therapist. They only make things worse... id suggest finding a new one. Try asking for another referral via email. If he refuses to give one, I am sure the licensing board would love to hear about that lol  Honestly. Like these people are *mental health experts* that are supposed to help you but only make you worse.\n\nI cannot imagine a suicidal individual coming to a therapist for help only for them to get shut down and hurt. It would literally push them over the edge, and I bet there is many cases of this happening Your absolutely right. Dealing with people is wayy different than just reading it out of a textbook. We are humans, not freakin robots.\n\nAnd yup, that is exactly what he did. I guess when he figured I was not the 'average typical case', he spent 20 minutes telling me it was *my* fault (I was too unmotivated and stubborn to change), then basically told me to never come back until I could talk again (oh the irony! I am sitting here in front of you because I *want* to talk and I am determined to change!). \n\nHe even thought I must have been in special education because \"how did you survive all these without talking?\". Like I literally see no connection between the two?? Not talking does not equal special needs. He also spent quite a few minutes emphasizing the fact that I must have been forced to come here (I told him multiple times this was not the case (shook my head) and my dad also said that I was the one who *wanted* to come)\n\nIt is like if there is no textbook solution to a patient's case, it is just better to kick them out and never see them again until they turn into the patients you are used to dealing (aka the ones that can talk) because they do not fit any of the labels. Just a reminder to you all not to get discouraged from visiting a mental health professional. Just make sure it is someone who has an understanding of SM and is decent at their job. Things like this is a red flag to change your psychiatrist and find a new one. Yup that is what baffled me the most. He was so stuck on my \"not talking\" that he did *nothing* about my supposed GAD. He did not tell what it was (I only know because I have searched this up many times before) or how to control my anxiety or prescribe any meds or tell me any techniques. It was so weird?? He could not even identify that I was having a panic attack and not just crying. I understand he does not agree I have SM but he could have at least helped me with my \"GAD\"?\n\nAnd yup this is a huge sign to find another therapist (I cannot go back to him anyways since I cannot make that phone call to him LOL sooo..). Thanks for the advice\ud83d\ude0a\n\nAnd yes, unfortunately I am not from England but I guess I will look to find another therapist! No worries, I enjoyed your story.\n\nAnd wow that sounds like an awesome doctor! It is so rare to find someone that actually cares for their patients and does not view them as \"just patients\" that need to be treated. So glad you found a doctor that worked for you!\n\nAnd coincidentally I did the exact thing as you\ud83d\ude02 I came home and complained to my mom about how weird the doctor was (I actually used the word 'weird' over and over cuz I had no other words to describe it lol).\n\nAnd yes, I am likely going to have to see another therapist (if my dad lets me). But its not like I can go be able to go back to this guy again because no way am I going to be able to make that phone call to him lol. Thanks this made me feel better \ud83d\ude0a \n\nAnd yup there is no way I am going back to that guy. I am going to have to find another one (if my dad lets me). My family is sort of supportive I guess? They know I have a problem and want me to start talking again (which is why they let me go to a psychiatrist) but they still do not really believe that its SM. But its fine, as long as I am getting the help I need I guess. Fucking terrible. That dude is a complete asshole and it makes zero sense how he landed such a sensitive job. I do not have SM anymore and I would give him hell for the way he treated you if I was talked to like that. Tell your dad everything and make sure he goes there in person and complains until he is fucking heard because that behavior is next to criminal and he needs to be confronted for it. Do not let him get away with this shit and if you do the phone call with him, put your dad on the phone to give him the most shit possible. I would not have talked to that dickhead either\n\nOr if I did it would be a burst of anger that would make him kick me out anyways lol Yup, ngl I was sooooo mad, If it was not for my SM I probably would have flew off the handle or just walked out on my own lol. \n\nBut I did give him the middle finger under my jacket that I was holding that he could not see, soooo... How did you get over your SM?", "How do i befriend someone with SM? ", "Incoherence speech / text. My speech or texting is very incoherent when I have emotions.  \n\nDoes anyone else experience this or is it just me, and/ or is it me feeling safer to talk more, or something related to my trauma?", "I think i might have selective mutism According to my parents I did not speak at all during nursery. They only found out on the last day. Apparently I spoke and some other kids said surprised \"Alex can speak!\" So my parents asked the teacher why they were saying that and they said that he never spoke and when I wanted to go to the bathroom I would point. \n\nIts not so bad now but with certain people or situations my voice goes really quiet and its just difficult to speak. Like today a teacher tried to talk to me to help me. I am not a good student in anyway. And all I managed to do was quietly say yeah or maybe. \n\nI cannot talk to teachers or doctors. I can only manage like 2 word sentences and its usually too quiet anyway. \n\nSorry for ranting I am just confused", "The cure to end all cures Morning\n1 hour run\n-30 minute cold shower \n-10 minute wim hoff\n-30 minute meditation \n\nAfternoon \n\u201425 minute meditation \n-10 minute cold shower \n\nEvening\n-1hr workout(calisthenics+cardio)\n-30 minute meditatiom\n-30 minute cold shower\n-20 minute wimhoff\n\nThroughout the day you need to think positive, repeat to yourself \u201cI speak loudly, I am blessed to be able to see and walk, I give myself permission to be loud\u201d.

I can relate. I do not really have the best social skills and have started talking to people online. The process has been very hard for me. I find that I experience a lot of anxiety, but I really want to connect so I keep on trying. I am the same way. Really I just try to distract myself afterward, and even tell myself \u201cWell if I overstepped or said something stupid it is done already. I cannot go back and change it.\u201d \n\nI force force force myself to think of anything else. It is very difficult and my physical reaction (heart racing, shaking, sweating) has not really gotten better with time, but I am getting better at remembering that I need to distract myself, so that my distress does not last as long. It is so hard. It is okay if you look bad from time to time. Caring about looking bad is very human, so congratulations, you are actually quite normal! \n\nReject seriousness.\n\nEmbrace silliness.\n\nOnly act out of a place natural giving. Unnatural giving will only come back to hurt you and those around you.\n\nIf your sincere self is rejected and you know it is wrong, just remember how stupid people are sometimes, and then remember to forgive them eventually because you are also stupid sometimes. damn, i relate to this SO much. it is really torn up my friendships, the anxiety when it comes to texting.\n\ni do have some advice though. when you send something, think about how you would react if you were the person receiving the message. put yourself in another mindset. if somebody sent you that message, would you think of it as cringey or weird, or not at all? for me, most of the time it is not at all. if it were me, i would just be happy to get a message, and i think that applies to a lot of people. but yeah, i try my best to do this on the rare occasion i message people and i have found it to be decently helpful. it is definitely not a quick fix to the anxiety and overthinking, but it helps a bit :)\n\ni hope things get better for you, OP! i know how much of a struggle this is and it hurts seeing other people go through the same things i do. wishing you the best &lt;3 It felt so good to hear someone articulate this! I do not have any advice, I am struggling to begin this journey over again.\n\nMaybe the fact you are trying is paramount. Maybe what is important is giving other people the opportunity to take care of and accept you. Being open again and again until it all starts to amount to something. That would be my intuition. I still have to find it within myself to be courageous again. When I started speaking again 7 years ago, after 7 years of not speaking, I had this exact problem. And to be honest, it took a few years to get past this problem. For me, it was repeated exposure to social situations, and making conscious efforts to put myself into increasingly challenging social situations, that gradually led to feeling comfortable with the things I want to say. Really you have to be willing to make a fool of yourself over and over again until you stop giving a crap.\n\nAlso, \"The quick and easy way to effective speaking\" by Dale Carnegie was very helpful. My SM has mostly been fixed but I too get similar thoughts after talking to/texting someone. I can spend 40+ minutes drafting a 2 sentence text before sending. \n\nOddly enough, and this may be weird, but what works best for me is to just think things like, \"Fuck  them if they thought that was weird. It is over. I do not even care.\" I do not text my Dad more than one word at times. Thought what I do is, I just hit send and throw my phone away. I should try to type back more, but it is sort of another stigma.\n\nEdit: And I am going through the sub rn, Ik this is 5months later.", "general question for people with sm Hi, I thought the other day that I would be more likely to talk to someone like shop staff or something alone rather than being with someone. \n\nI have spoken to someone alone before fine I am so confused as to how I can talk so freely being alone than with someone being there. \n\nAnyway was wondering if anyone else with sm gets this, or if its just me  \ud83d\ude0a That used to be me when I had sm. For example, in school, I could not ask my teachers for help while in class, but after class when everyone left I would speak to them. I think the reason is lack of judgement which is the crux of social anxiety. When you are alone with someone, there are less eyes on you, so you feel more comfortable speaking because there is less people that can possibly judge you. I can talk to someone alone (a stranger) if I KNOW no one, that knows me/I know...will find out about it.\n\nThough that talking is not normal, but it is possible for me to do. I keep it to the exact point though, I am never making conversation with anyone.....besides ordering food, but the last time I did that alone was 7th grade I think....now that is about 7 years ago.\n\nIt is even when I do, I am not used to speaking in any sort of normal voice, so it is weird....idk how loud or quiet I am being.\n\nFriends are really the only people I can talk most normally to, at least over Xbox....and in-person if it is just those who know me over Xbox.........there is just no real expectation that I do not talk to them, but there is not one that I am loud.....it just sort of works.....they know I did not speak in school, but it was never really a burden of the sense......but I have not talked with them since June of 2021, because I just have not played xbox.........I am waiting on the Series X, but that is impossible to get and it will be more than a year since that came out whenever.\n\nI want to play Madden 22, 2K21 (since I have that one, now outdated), and the GTA Definitive Editions.....and MLB.....and Minecraft with them, we usually play once upon a time.........\n\nBut then there is the issue of the room I am in, if my Mom wants to 'open the wall' of this room, since it is the Den, I sleep in the Den......She knows it will be bad if I have to move out of this room (that has to do with my OCD relating to my actual room, I hate that room....part of the reason besides boredom, I stopped playing Xbox).......if that happened and I did not have all 4 walls and a door, idk how I would begin to play this next Xbox....with talking or at all, I hate people watching what I am doing.....if someone comes in the room, it is rare I will stay on my Laptop's chrome browser instead of the desktop......my own wallpaper uses morse code (I made that way), so I can say what I want without anyone able to freely read it.\n\nIt is been 10 months since I have snapchatted my friends and they have not snapped me, but one does...the one I would have never met without Xbox/my other friends....he still includes me even though I never snap him back. I think my other friends just do streaks and idk, I am not really thinking too much into it.\n\nI actually have a Youtube channel from 2016 (9th grade) to 2021 (college)...june of 2021, after that I unofficially quit, I think eventually I will go back to it....but on that channel I do talk, but I am \"anonymous,\" my friends know and watch it....but that is fine..........as long as my parents never find out about it.......it actually caused me to get into drama in HS........but I look back on that hannel and remember I was pretty memey.....Xbox had this Upload Studio app and that helped me get into it.....now I can only record through twitch, as I would never ask for recording software.........and so on........but the Upload Studio was great because over long periods I tend to suffer, especially now as I fear speaking aloud in my room.....I can still go in my room to play Xbox, just not much else...besides getting dressed. And I look back on simple videos before I ever edited them and they are so naturally funny. Something I have not matched in a while..........I used to sponge everyone elses jokes up from HS to keep it going.\n\nYou can tell looking back if you know the right people, I took heavy inspiration from my one friend........idk. Anyway, that is it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I think it is building an expectation that you can suddenly speak like you can, if you ever happen to speak 'normally' in front of someone, to them. I experience a similar thing where I could talk to someone at the shop for example not full blown conversations in ANY WAY but only if it was just me though it used to be the other way around where I could only speak if there was someone else with me and they were not able to speak (e.g couse of anxiety) I guess cause it made me feel good helping someone but now its just getting worse I guess I get this!! thank u for sharing this with me :) I used to get something similar to that, when I went to public school I could talk to certain teachers only around certain people like friends or classmates. I even spoke in front of a whole class a couple of times though quietly. Anyway when it came to talking to my friends I could not unless if the teacher was there. Eventually I started talking to my best friend at the time without anyone just me and her though when it came to secondary schools she completely ghosted me and never cared about me which really hurt and still does.\n\nBut anyway thank you for sharing your story! :)", "I wish that my parents would have got me treatment when it first started... I was diagnosed with selective mutism around age 4, and this is when I stopped speaking with my grandparents, uncles/aunts, and some cousins. But worst of all I stopped speaking at school. My mom never got me properly treated for my anxiety disorder, so it of course has not gone away. When I moved schools at age 9 I was able to talk at school because it was a fresh start (but I was very shy)! Now that I am almost 19, I still have selective mutism around my grandparents and uncles/aunts. It pains me how my parents and family are not understanding about it and think that it is my job to get help for it now. If only it had been treated when I was a child then I would not still have it. At this point it is not really interfering with my life; I am in university, and I hardly see my extended family anyways. But my family is not understanding about how I still have SM around my grandparents. I am fine the way I am now; a relationship is not solely based on talking! Now I am busy in life and would rather not go through therapy that would bring back memories to grade school. How do I get my family to stop worrying about me and judging me about my condition? I feel you. My parents did not realize I had selective mutism until I was a teen and I have had it all my life I think. I always felt angry that they did not get the right help and sometimes felt hopeless, like it is too late to get better or something. Feel free to pm me if you want to chat about it I can relate. I stopped talking in school in kindergarten and I never got any treatment for it, so it continued all the way through elementary school. I only started talking in 6th grade because I went to a different middle school than everyone else and I had a clean slate, nobody could judge me or make a big deal our of my talking if nobody knew me. I talk a lot more now and I am more comfortable with it, but there are still some people who I am uncomfortable talking to because they knew me before I started talking. Family and family friends specifically seem like they would be hard for me to talk to. It makes me glad that I do not know any of my extended family and I do not need to talk to them. I feel this. I did not know about selective mutism until this year (I am 24!) and I have had it pretty much all my childhood. It hurt a lot when I realized how different life could have been had I gotten help earlier. But dwelling on the past and pointing blame at my parents for not realizing sooner is not going to get me anywhere. I have taken some time to grieve my childhood self who did not get help, but now that I am an adult it actually is my responsibility to seek treatment. \n(hope that did not sound harsh, just wanted to share my experience and let you know you are not alone). \n\nAs for how to stop people from judging you- let me know if you ever find out. It is still good that you got a diagnosis. I went undiagnosed and spent 90% of my life wondering what was wrong with me. I hated myself so much because I did not really have an excuse or reason to be mute. (I am normal at home, so my family did not know I had a problem, just wondered why I had no friends. And none of my teachers told my parents that I did not talk to my classmates).", "Can someone has SM but only as a child? If someone had all the symptoms (or most of them) as a child but was not diagnosed with it, does it still counts? And if they were undiagnosed as a kid, when they grow older, are they more prone to have anxiety or maybe CPTSD? When I was little, people would think I was mute, well I did not have a lot of friends (until now still). I think I tend to push people away from me. But I kind of healed? (I am sorry I do not know the perfect word as English is not my first language) I can talk to people now easily. Please help to explain this to me. Definitely, I am not an expert on it, just someone who had/had it, people can be almost completely \u2018cured\u2019 of SM, but most or a lot at least go on to have some aspects of it in the future, like anxiety etc Yup. I had it primarly as a young child (like 4 years old), then outgrew my SM and was just \"shy\" throughout my childhood, but not mute. So I basically overcame it.\n\nBut then around 6th grade I got bullied, then slowly my SM started to come back in around 8th grade. I became mute again in high school so... I guess I never really overcomed my SM, I just basically repressed it, and given the right circumstances (bullying) it came back.\n\nSo, ya definetely you could have it as a child and overcome it later on. It is cptsd \ud83d\udc94 I was diagnosed with SM in primary school. I could not speak to adults and not much with kids my age by high school I could speak to adults minus some situations, I am now 17 and now only in very few situations I freeze and cannot speak. \nSo to answer your question yes but your SM could \"come back\" when you do not expect it or if under stress which sometimes happens to me It is common for people to 'overcome' SM when they age, even without specific treatment (although by no means does everyone, especially without treatment). Most people will still have some anxiety even if they no longer have SM. I had it from 3rd grade to 8th grade", "Another question for those who recovered, When did you commit to the post-SM life? (Full question in post) When were you no longer afraid to fully commit to speaking to those you could not/the post-SM life?\n\nUpdate for my day too: I spoke more than normal, but I could not really commit to speaking in the grand scheme, I am pretty much just afraid to bridge to that 'new life' of expression vs the comfort of now. The mindset is there, I just cannot commit.\n\nAlso I know, I still post a ton, and I think my questions might be pretty similar, but yeah. I feel like it will take awhile to cross that bridge, but every time you speak up when you might not have before is a step in the right direction. \n\nMy post sm life is still pretty quiet, in meetings at work I very rarely speak up unless addressed directly and while I am okay with my family gatherings, at my partners they all think I am a frigid bitch, but like I do not know how to speak when all they do is talk about shit I do not know. I do not have an answer for this(cause were kind of in the same boat) but i want to give my thoughts on this question.\n\nIve been diagnosed about half a year ago, and i knew what sm even was a year ago. No one really helped my sm except myself, and after like 16, unless youre in a friend group with people who have empathy for you, no ones going to care enough to help in any meaningful way except yourself.\n\nSince i understand the mindset behind this question so much, i assume you are in a similar boat?\n\nI think the people here who are \"recovered sm\" had some sort of help, be it finding an actually good therapist, or getting help at a young age, or they can function okay in society even with their sm. Obviously this wont describe everyone, and if im wrong correct me.\n\nWhat im saying is you likely will not find anyone that is in the exact same situation as you and solved it themselves without getting lucky. \n\nBut keep going of course, cause if you find someone who went through what we (i assume) are going through and solved it themselves, then I need to know who they are. I talk but I am still not committed. Because it is the only way I get to keep my peace, but I do not need to tell you that.\nI do not work, I am trying to figure that one out. I used to talk a lot more, I did not even know I was masking, only diagnosed a year ago, so since then, I am stuck between caring for my health and not small-talking, and being able to provide for myself again. Curious to see where the balance lands.\n\nI talk, and I hate it every time I do That is definitely it too when it comes down to it, I do not know what to add to conversations even if I wanted to commit to it. Unless you ask me questions directly. I also tend to speak the best when I am being yelled at by my Mom. That is not ideal. Yeah, it definitely comes down to us. I think I am just so afraid of committing to that speaking life. I think Jessica Spears on YouTube, I liked her videos talking about her SM. \n\nThe only people I have now are my family, but my siblings besides the oldest do not push me to talk in any way useful. So I really find it hardest to speak with my Dad, my Brother, and my Youngest Sister. Random Strangers are fine, although it is such a non-normal occurrence that I am still nervous when I do it.\n\nI think the next step for me might be telling my family 'I am taking the medicine,' although that is not the route that I want to go, I do not want to risk being addicted to some drug and I just do not think it will help that much. Though I feel I may actually be able to eliminate the fear of those around me reacting to me speaking fully, although I told them that reacting is bad....I still fear of it. Is your home life not ideal? I never struggled to speak at home, my mom actually was shocked when she found out I did not speak at school. I think... not ideal parents can make it harder to move past the SM life, I relied heavily on my \"comfort people\" to slowly get to a point where I would speak in school. I cannot imagine how rough it would be.... otherwise. Yeah, I would prefer to be in your shoes honestly. Strangers to me (although I did not speak in school as normally as others, I could speak to some students and some teachers I asked to go to the bathroom or nurse over the years...the nurse being the one I talked to the most normal since they had no clue who I was). It is true though, my family is the hard area, extended too (though I think if I break into my direct family, that extended would come naturally). I cannot talk to strangers in front of them.\n\nMy Mom has always been very yell-y and can be very condescending if my life is not going her way, my Dad is a very supportive person. But for him, it is sort of hard to be someone who would not relate his current image of me. Also he does not ever bring topics in conversation that require me to talk back in any way meaningful....My siblings (maybe my brother), they are fine in the general sense. My Dad is also too supportive that it hurts progress. And my Mom's condescension does not help either.\n\nI also wish they would just all sit down and talk with me just about stuff in general. Maybe that would help more. My Mom will and is better when she is better, and that is good but she will take away focus from the problem  I think she is the easiest to talk to because she makes it the most normal to talk. My Mom will also not often leave me room to speak.\n\nMy brother though, I also find it hard to be myself in front of him because I hold him to a very high-esteem. Though I always try to keep the mindset 'They are my family, how I can not talk to them?'\n\nMy Mom used to think I could not talk to anyone but in the last month, I disclosed that I can talk to strangers. So that is stunted progress, they never knew my true problems. Pre Middle School, since it developed into school.....I did talk to my family more normally, although they never encouraged me to speak in my childhood, and I always never found the need to. Past 6th grade I really stopped talking to my family like that. Now I am 18 going into the 2nd year of college where I plan to work on talking to people who do not know me, hopefully that translates to home. In the meantime I plan on by 19. I do not want to go past that age with this.\n\nAlso to continue ranting, there is this girl that I have had my mind on for a month since I bumped into her with my brother, sister, and mom....my Mom got her number, the way I get the number was finding out her passcode and getting it that way (this was a few days ago). I know that sounds bad. And that is another thing, I can not admit for my life that I would actually want something like that to anybody. My brother last night said as I laid my head down at the kitchen table...\"Maybe (my name) needs a girlfriend.\" I just sat there still, although that is really the drive for change right now. My Dad's also been supportive of maybe reaching out to the girl, but even then I never give him an answer yes/no (not even a nod).....He is the type to take that as I am 'uninterested' though that is not what I mean. It means I am not going to admit to it.....my Mom would take that that way, which is a shame.\n\nRegardless it is better because I realized that I do want to change. Also at the same time, I feel like committing to talking would lead to that pursuing and at the same time pursuing a girl scares me, so that may be another reason I am afraid to commit to talking. I have not done anything with that number besides putting it in my phone. I also do not go out on my own, ever. So maybe if I did....\n\nEdit: But my Dad has gone 10 plus days between mentioning it, and has not mentioned it in about 5 when he was the most serious about it. I do not think I would do anything unless they would push me to. I had SM my whole life, up until the age of 14/15ish. For me there was no 'click', just very slow, very gradual change. I began talking more and more, and slowly it just became easier. And before I even noticed- I no longer fit the criteria for SM. \n\nEven today, almost a decade later, I have some social anxiety but can still 'talk' when needed. Hell, I even ENJOY talking and socialising now. It is also important to note that even if you ever feel like you have 'lost progress', that is fine and normal. Recovery is not a straight line and some days will be worse than others. More importantly, some days will be better than others too.", "relationships how have ppl with sm met their s/o if it ended up working out? very much confused on how it would work out considering i do not feel like i could just meet someone in person how awkward i am in person &amp; over text everyone just seems to want sex / nudes. anyone with sm come out as demisexual or consider it? confuses me just bc of the fact that i also have severe anxiety For mine, we met in school. He spent months doing everything he could to make me laugh and talk. Eventually, we started texting and could finally have conversations that way. I still cannot really talk much in person with him even though it is been six months, but hes patient with me. \n\nI know you can find a relationship eventually, it will just take the right person. Sorry if that is not very helpful. no its okay that is ur experience, i met my ex in grade 12 it was only 3 months tho he said someone with my anxiety should not be with somwone with bpd &amp; also did not know how i felt sexually. im 19 &amp; on disability now so its just idk  yes but also from my car accident cuz i broke my femur im prob not much help as i have an ot who helped me My SO and I met through friends we were promoted to snapchat every day to get a streak and we just started clicking. I consider myself demisexual/asexual and I met my husband online. It was a very random meeting. He viewed my page and I sent a note asking if he saw anything interesting while viewing my page. He was very understanding about my SM and anxiety. He talked on yahoo messenger mostly then we began texting and sending emails. We tried video calls but I could not talk. We did not call on the phone. He visited my island (I am from the Caribbean and he is from France) two years after we decided we wanted to date. It was hard at first because I still felt anxious but after about an hour I started talking to him like I did online. It will be 12 years in April and I am so glad I sent that note.   Honestly, the internet lol. In my experience, it is just another low energy way to put yourself out there. You never know who will come across your profile. My bf had come out of a really long relationship, for some reason asked to take me to a music festival, we wound up meeting at a bar. Instead of trying to have sex with me he just held me to fall asleep. We woke up, I found out from a phone call from his dad that it was his birthday (lol), we walked somewhere to get breakfast, and the rest is history. You go on a lot of dates and you endure a lot of incompatibility and awkwardness, but every so often you come across an arrangement that works for you. It is a numbers game, and it winds up fine if you remember the real metric is finding the qualities you are looking for. My bf and I are really different people, like we are into different things, but we were both quiet, curious, and looking for companionship. We had a really humble thing and we kept building on it. I was really lucky that he was patient with me. Eventually I find more of the words to explain what I am going through, and he does not judge. As I am able to figure out what I am going through, if I have the courage to say it I will say it to him and it helps us both. But he is also seen the worst of it, has taken it personally when I have had nonverbal meltdowns, the like. Our foundation is that we are both committed to each other, and of course to not act like an asshole, so you take care of your partner when you are able to again. It is really so possible to get connected with someone who is good for you, just not always easy, but when it works it is better than anything else you can ask for. I have always felt like an alien, and I have always felt like no one could ever know that real me, or even want to when they realize I am hard to love. I thought my bf was hot, he thought I was hot, we were willing to take a chance, and 4 years later I have someone who is my home. I still think it is a mortifying process to be known, but I allow it for him. Now our lives are suited to our hermetic needs and we are very happy. \ud83d\ude0c", "For all of us trying. &lt;3   Thank you so much for this  Love you", "\"Became Selectively Mute Because of the Trauma\" | Male Sexual Assault  I did a search for \"traumatic mutism\" and found the vid from the main post and also this:\n\n(\n\nI would heard many times on this sub that mutism related to trauma was not selective mutism, which led to the above search.\n\nI experienced mutism that I see as fueled by hypervigilance caused by child abuse/neglect.\n\nJust posting this so that others who experienced the same might find this.\n\nI am not knowledgeable on the distinction between traumatic and selective mutism, if there really is one. I am trying to figure it out, but hopefully this can make others who experienced the same feel less crazy. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder, so there is a distinction between SM and traumatic mutism. The reason it matters is because treatment for someone who has a severe social anxiety disorder and someone who is been through extensive trauma will be very different. This makes sense. I overcame my extreme shyness by recognizing I would been abused and feared more abuse. I was also in an extremely unhealthy environment and could not relate to \"being anxious for no reason\". But what I experienced still looked a lot like SM. It started in childhood, I was never totally mute. Sometimes I acted normal and other times aI struggled. But because my home was not a safe environment there was not a clear distinction between my behavior at home and school. It was not night and day, exactly. I can also relate to having my identity revolve around my silence and fearing having people comment on any growth, as in fearing comments like \"omg she is saying something\".\n\nIt was exactly like SM, except my environment was unhealthy and I was also experiencing ptsd like symptoms. How is it different I do not know anything about mutism as a result of trauma. Those 2 vids encompass all I know so far. \n\nI experienced childhood abuse and neglect. I learned about SM at 13 and told my mom I thought I had it. When it was at it is worst, I was an immigrant afraid to be deported if I spoke about my home life. Then we all got deported and I was then in a culture that did not take any mental illness seriously. I was openly mocked by school teachers for my issue.\n\nIt was never taken seriously. I never went to therapy. When I did see a psychiatrist, he was abusive and said I was lying about my parents and symptoms for attention. It led to the creation of r/badshrinks, a post traumatic hate project that also might help people validate their possible similar experiences were significant.\n\nWhat I had followed the patterns of SM, but there was no significant difference between my behavior at home and school a lot of the time, I could not feel safe anywhere.\n\nI could go almost totally mute for significant periods of time.

I wish those people's careers end. absolutely horrible. How do they end up with these jobs that are SUPPOSE to help people but DO EXACTLY THE OPPISITE?! I just started a discord where we can discuss SM as it relates to trauma\n\nlink here (will never expire) (", "Possible SM in toddler with an inhibited temperament I posted this over at r/ScienceBasedParenting without much response, so I thought I would post here in case there are other parents in the same boat. The post is actually about the ( temperament but my daughter also fits the description of ( but is too young to be diagnosed with anxiety.\n\n**Does anyone have information sources that focus on very young children and prevention of anxiety (including selective mutism) or the BI temperament?** \n\nMy daughter is 22 months old and has exhibited the BI temperament since approximately 3 months of age. I have a long list of behaviours over her life that indicate this temperament and am currently on a wait list to discuss this with a child psychologist (the wait list I am on is for the office that includes Dr. Annie Simpson, a recommended psychologist on the SM Association website). After the 15 minute in-take phone call, the psychologist (one who also specializes in SM and runs and SM summer camp) said that based on the few examples I provided, my daughter is likely \"highly\" inhibited, but that they will not diagnose SM (or any anxiety disorder) in such a young child, especially one that is mostly pre-verbal. The concern about a severe BI temperament is that these kids have a ( So, my search for information is about **how to best support her in life such that she does not develop anxiety**.\n\nThe difficulties I am struggling with:\n\n1. my daughter is young and most articles prescribe treatments (like CBT) for children &gt;= 3 years (but more typically for school-aged children)\n2. inhibited, shy and introverted are temperaments and I do not think they are necessarily bad (I identify as all 3). I do not want to \"fix\" her or change who she is, but guide her to maintain good mental health and not develop anxiety (I do not have anxiety, but did experience \"triggered\" anxiety during my pregnancy, so I know what anxiety feels like and I do not want her to experience it). Many articles label shyness and inhibition as negative traits to be fixed. \n3. I find it difficult (given my temperament!) to communicate to others (parents at the park, for example) about why my child is behaving the way she is (suddenly bursting into tears if they look at her, going into a \"freeze\" state). Some articles say that you should not label your child as \"shy\" because then they will be shy. But, it is hard to talk to other parents about this without using some sort of synonymous word. And frankly, I do not think being shy is bad, nor something you can necessarily change (i.e. it is a stable temperament). Anyway, I would love to hear any **suggestions about how to approach discussing this topic with basic strangers at the park in front of my child who I do not want to make feel bad about her reactions**. So far, I often just pick up my child and offer soothing words to her and walk away and avoid the whole situation of discussing it with others, but I am finding that as she gets older, this is becoming more difficult as other parents think that kids should be \"social\" and able to play without the parent right there. I know I look like a helicopter parent, even though I feel confident that I am providing appropriate scaffolding and support to my child.\n\nSome articles on the subject of BI temperament:\n\n(\n\n&gt;encourage him or her to be independent and give him or her the opportunity to problem-solve for himself or herself\n\n(\n\n&gt;caregiving style that encourages children to develop independence and confidence may help children reduce their distress in new social environments\n\n(\n\n&gt;Children who have been encouraged to explore, take risks and take on challenges develop better coping skills and learn to moderate their tendency to withdraw or avoid situations they perceive to be threatening. A broad range of experience also means that the young child is faced with fewer unfamiliar\u00a0situations and is better at predicting what will happen next.\n\n(\n\n&gt;Kids are not yet anxious, but can have the temperament that may predispose them to become anxious \nIt is actually very common for people with Selective Mutism to have inhibited temperaments. \n\nI am not sure where you are located, but Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania does work with young children that have selective mutism. Although your daughter may be a little too young at the moment. Here is a link to their website -  I am in Canada. I am on the wait list for the group with Annie Simpson and some of their psychologists do work with young children. At this stage, it is really more about providing me (the parent) with strategies to help support her, as opposed to her doing anything specific. She is a toddler so she probably will not be doing CBT any time soon! One thing the psych suggested I do while I am waiting is specifically praise bravery. Now, whenever my daughter smiles at someone at the park I exclaim, \"You just smiled at that person; you must be feeling brave today.\" And I suggest that we can say \"Hi\" if we want. So far, she has not taken me up on that suggestion ;)\n\nActually, that link you posted is the first link I came across when I googled SM and my husband and I both read it and said, \"oh my gosh, that is \\!\" The psych then told me about BI so that is when I started learning about that temperament too.\n\nI always think being proactive, spending a bit of money up front (on a psychologist), and getting strategies in early is the best thing to do to prevent anxiety, but I guess I am tackling it even earlier than most... even the psychologist was surprised I was inquiring about SM this early. I first saw the term on Reddit, so thank goodness for the internet :) It is awesome that you are being so proactive. My SM was never treated until I was 15 because I was shy, would grow out of it, was misbehaving, it was not a big enough deal, etc.   Your child is too young to understand CBT and such, but I think next best thing is for *you* to understand CBT. If you understand the ideas that guide anxiety treatment, then you can help guide your child in the right direction.\n\nI would encourage you to read up on anxiety, social anxiety, anxiety treatment, exposure therapy for anxiety, and CBT for anxiety. If you have a solid understanding of how anxiety works and how it is successfully treated, then you will be well prepared to explain your child's anxiety and understand how to deal with anxiety when it inevitably comes up.\n\nGood luck. Hope all goes well for you and your child. Thank you for your suggestion. I have actually done CBT for a different medical condition and my sister has done CBT for PTSD after birth, so luckily I have some first-hand knowledge of the foundation of that treatment. I am having trouble translating it into strategies for very young children, but I came across an online anxiety course through my province for children and youth so I think I might work through that to increase my knowledge. Even the simple suggestion from the psychologist to praise bravery seems so logical now, but I did not come up with it myself! I second not calling it too soon. I also had a case of SM that carried over into adulthood and wish I would gotten help earlier. I even had read about SM on the internet at the age of around 14 or 15 but did not have it in me to seek out help all on my own. I did see a therapist around that age who was really unempathetic, I think I heard something like \"you are not fit for highschool\", I cannot remember the wording, I just remember feeling belittled and unheard, lol. Even if she does not have SM, some of the strategies that are helpful for SM children could be beneficial to her. Thank you for your encouragement. What a terrible therapist! I have had my fair share of very unsympathetic medial professionals for my own non-SM condition and it makes it difficult to get good treatment because you get this feeling of wariness every time you explain to a doctor/therapist what the issue is. I am very hopeful about the psychology group I am waiting on and I feel more confident standing up for my daughter than I ever did standing up for myself! Confidence grows in the Momma Bear :) I would recommend a few things. I would start staging some CBT like parenting approaches now. So, try to write down several baby-step challenges that you would be able to control and move her up the ladder of challenges when she is feeling safe. I would not rescue her in the scary situations, because that will just reinforce the fear. Do not talk for her either. You can rephrase someone is question into an open ended question or forced choice question, but wait a while for her to respond if she is verbal. \n\nAt this point I would probably focus on the environment and where you are taking her. If you know of a few places she enjoys and feels less stress, I would start there. If she is okay being at a friend's house, start with that until she is comfortable with you moving into another room and interacting with your friends. Make sure a lot of your focus is on talking in front of people. Videos, video chats, plays, telling stories, reading to others, etc. Non-verbal expression is also good, but I would make sure you are working on getting her talking in front of everyone and often. And praise each time! When she is interacting with others, it needs to be a pleasant experience that keeps her anxiety low, with gentle pushes towards doing something \"scary\". Make it as fun as possible, because when we are having fun, we tend to try new things more easily. If you know she can do something, go along side of her and do it with her. I usually overcome my fears more easily when someone shows me how to do something the first time. Make sure she is experiencing anything and everything when she is young, if you have the means. Go on trips, do lots of activities, so she can fall back on those introductions and know it is not so foreign. \n\nIf she is obviously scared, do not baby her or remove her right away. If you need to explain to the other parents or kids, just say you are working on bravery today. Stay in the moment and ask her if she is uncomfortable. Give her lots of words for her emotions. Scared, angry, hurt, worried, happy, excited. Use them often to help her navigate the feelings. Let her know it is okay to feel those things. You can tell her they might feel scary, but she will be okay. Teach her how to breathe through those moments. \n\nAnd I would highly recommend looking into how diet effects anxiety. Make sure you are only eating healthy foods with no preservatives and dyes. Look at the microbiome/anxiety connection. I also just read an article about Polysorbate 80 and how they are finding that it might contribute to anxiety and social issues. MSG and Glutamate is another one I would research. Read labels and get all the junk out of the house. We have been doing daily smoothies and adding magnesium and other supplements and it is helping. In your case I would focus on the organic fruits and veggies and not supplement until she is older, or work with your doctor on that. Some supplements that help, vitamin D, B vitamins, magnesium, fish oil, NAC. You can do Epsom Salt and essential oil baths to help her nervous system calm down a little naturally too. The Epsom Salt has magnesium and is easy on the system. Please ask your doctor or do your research for a child that age first though. Thank you for all your suggestions. I appreciate the time you took to write this! I will definitely start working on baby-step exposure ladders. I know that I do rescue her sometimes and I need to work on stating the discomfort without \"running away\" from the situation. I will have to be more conscious of talking to other people in front of her in comfortable settings. So far, I have one other home (my sister's) that she feels comfortable in, so I will focus on that first.", "Nominations are ongoing for our annual \"Best of\" awards. ", "Depressive mutism?... I know SM is an anxiety disorder but often I am unable to speak because I am so depressed. Is that a thing? Do you think SM could also be a depressive disorder as well? Like how some people with ADHD struggle only with attention and others only with hyperactivity and others still with both. Just spitballing here. Depression and anxiety are often comorbid, with symptoms that can overlap or cause the other.  I feel the same way. ... Sounds like your \"spirit\" is pretty low, which is probably the culprit for your brand of \"mutism\".\n\nI know the whole \"soul/spirit\" terminology is almost interchangeable these days, but by \"soul\", I would really refer more to the core identity of who you are -- your \"reason for being\" so to speak, while \"spirit\" would more refer to the \"energy or passion to do what is important to your soul.\"\n\nHaving a low \"spirit\" just means that your overall drive to do what matters to you in this world is pretty much empty. Your drive suffers because you \"soul\" is probably not being acknowledged or taken into account in your day-to-day life. Doing this blatantly for a very long time can even lead to bouts of wanting to \"off\" yourself or just a general hopeless feeling that can either get you to the point to where you can barely talk (because you do not have enough \"energy\" or \"drive\" to exert on the things that matter -- almost as if talking too is pointless), or your anxiousness will overwhelm you and drive you insane if you simply ignore it and rock-on as if everything is normal.\n\nThings can feel pointless when you know you are in a shit situation and you see no action you are willing to take to make your way out of said situation.   \nThere is almost always a way though.  \nIt usually involves saying/doing something you by no means want to do -- it can feel like you are about to self-destruct if you do it -- and you know what? -- It is crazy, but sometimes a self-destruct is necessary to find all the pieces you are currently missing -- the pieces that are buried beneath all the weight sitting right on top of you. That \"self-destruct\" is helpful if done for the right reasons -- and if you feel like you cannot go on in this world, to the point that you can no longer even talk... Then you probably need a \"healthy\" self-destruct so you can pick up only the pieces that are really important to you. \n\nThe rest is trash.\n\nI promise with all this newfound freedom from the weight on your shoulders, you will have the spirit to talk again. It might take a few days/weeks/months of crying, but at some point, you will feel better for sure. You will be better off.\n\nI know this because I am in the process of doing my own self-destruct.\n\nYou can do it over weeks/months (if your situation is particularly bad!), but do not go as long as a year -- if you do, you are defeating the purpose. You need to breathe -- and to do that, you got to get rid of the excess shit weighing you down and suffocating you. Your goal is to free your \"soul\" so it can be relevant again in your life -- and with that newfound freedom, it is easy to see how your \"spirit\" will follow.\n\nMaybe I am wrong, but I hope this helps in some way.  \n", "Is there anyone else who is afraid to overcome selective mutism? Sorry for my poor English, I hope you can understand. \n\nI am scared of living 'normal' life, because it is not normal for me. Selective Mutism is normal for me. I am afraid when for example I am not shaking in situations when I have done it before. Thinking about recovery is just scary. Is there anyone else afraid of it?", "Is it possible to develop SM late? Or have it mild in childhood and then worse in adulthood? I was thinking about selective mutism and my relationship to it.\n\nAs far as I remembered, my biggest problems with SM were in the last year of school, where I did not talk or managed to draw the teacher's attention to anything and depended on the person sitting next to me to speak for me.\n\nBut earlier today, I was thinking about it and I noticed a pattern.\n\nI remember that when I was younger, at school, in one way or another, I found a way to be alone. I would go to the place furthest from the mess and stay there. Sometimes I had company with two friends, but never more than that.\n\nIt is funny, because looking back, I was a very talkative person. But only with two people. Never more than two people at the same time. I spoke to other people, of course, but I always managed to isolate myself from the rest of the class. It was as if I chose two people and stayed with them, so when they missed class, I chose someone at random to spend the day or just be alone.\n\nI was more participative with the children on my street, but we lived on the same street, whether it was them or nothing.\n\nI also remember that when adults introduced me to someone, I could not speak. I was withdrawn, I thought that was shame and shyness, but maybe that was the SM.\n\nI also played a lot alone, I could spend hours playing only with my toys without having to talk to anyone else.\n\nHonestly, I do not know if I always had SM or if it came later, along with the other psychological problems.\n\nSo, I was thoughtful and I came here. My childhood memories are not the most reliable, I suck at dates and years and time in general.\n\nRepeating the question in the title, is it possible to develop SM late? Or have it mild in childhood and then worse in adulthood? Because, in my case, I think it got worse/started when I entered high school. You are looking for the term \"progressive mutism\".\n\nI think I experienced it. For me, either the problem started out as a reaction to violence at home or that just fueled my predisposition toward developing it.\n\nMy issue always felt like something that fed on itself. Like something that naturally snowballed with time. It isolated me, so I grew awkward and my self esteem plummeted. I had no confidence around people. It damaged my relationships with others, so I did not have opportunities to socialize. My family was bullying, critical and adamant it was all a big tantrum. My mom did not hesitate to call me embarrassing, rude, and , ironically, as she was very narcissistic, she claimed I thought I was better than other people. So I was always panicking because my fear itself earned me abuse. And fear was at the heart of my issue. I was suicidal as a little girl and have experienced passive suicidal thoughts at every stage of my life since.\n\nBut I did overcome it, although my social life has not outwardly improved much. I do think I have self esteem now that I have come to terms with everything that happened.  It used to feel unreal. My family's attitude towards it encouraged my inability to confront the issue head on. I thought I had no right to complain or feel bad about it. My mom would get red faced if someone dared to call me \"shy\" or \"inhibited\". In spanish, she would reply \"jokingly\" that I was \"just a bitch\" (translating loosely). I am in therapy trying to work on the trauma and horror of everything. Even though I can talk to people now, I still have the scars. I am sorry for the way your mom treats you. My family is not aggressive or anything, but they kind of gave up on me. They do not care if I go to parties, if I socialize or if I just say good morning. They just do not expect anything from me. \n\nI think in general people just think I am weird. At least I grew up with practically everyone calling me a weirdo.\n\nPS: Is progressive mutism part of the SM? It is definitely possible and it happened to me. Your story pretty much perfectly echoes mine. SM can definitely get worse overtime as it becomes ingrained, and from what I have seen puberty tends to worsen it, like with a lot of similar disorders. \n\nI do not think it would be progressive mutism, as that is considered the complete inability to speak to absolutely anyone in any situation/setting. Even people at home. It is essentially very severe SM. Luckily I never got to that point.  I was just defining progressive mutism as being a severe form of SM, not necessarily your SM. I am sorry. I messed things up. My text interpretation sometimes fails. That is alright. Mine does too :) I have noticed in stressful times it can be worse, mostly when it relates to my feelings/emotion. \n\nIt took me months to finally be able to tell friends when I lost family And was deep in grief.

I was not as conscious of it going through school, though I am out of school....now I am in college, which I more so go to because my Mom will otherwise make me get a job, although I never want a job until I am ready to have one, whenever that will be. *I do not want to be put in that situation as I am now.* \n\nI stay in college to avoid my Mom's thinkings, because really I believe time is more valuable than college...but ofc that is ironic as I waste my time. And even the 'professional' suggests that maybe I could apply to something, but how? I do not want to be put in a situation where I am unable to handle it, if I need to handle it. Until I am able to be in the situation without worry, I am not going to worry.\n\nAs life goes now....*I really do not know what I was about to say...and now I am going to go eat cause I am being harrased, I just knew when I want to write something, I write it now....though could have been thought out better but.*", "Friendships are difficult Like how do you even make friends? There is this group I hang out with. I hope they are not bothered by it. They do not seem to be. Sometimes it is awkward when I sit with people and they will actively try to get away from me. I do not mind sitting alone but I cannot because then I get adopted by the pity parade. People that try to force me to talk and stick around only because they feel bad for me. The thing is, I do not like writing because then I do not have a reason to not responding when I do not know how to have a conversation. What do I do?", "What are the worst things people have told you about your inability to talk? For me, it was when one of my classmates said \"God gave you a mouth for you to talk with.\" \n\nI have also had some people call me arrogant.", "Our experience  ( \n\n(\n\nWhat makes this piece really works for me is how it shows how unassociated she is to her class. Flip it down and you will hardly notice her, and vice versa.\n\nWhat really strucked me is the sense of being an outsider. The inability to see eye to eye with others gets tiring and frustrating when you want or expected to connect with others. Wow I love this! This is powerful", "genuinely just want an answer I had not heard of this until my mum recently did an e learning module on it for her new job working as a TA at a primary school and she mentioned that she recalls me displaying the same behaviours when I was young. I was always a shy kid although I never seemed to be short on friends and without fail in every parent teacher evening no matter what year or what class the teacher would always say the same thing 'she knows the stuff and she a lovely girl but she needs to speak up more'. I distinctly remember feeling incredibly shy and uncomfortable around adults I did not know well and I would never speak to them only look to my parents and maybe smile or nod. (TW) when I got to my teenage years I suffered with depression attempted suicide a couple times and was self harming and even though I had many friends at school and clubs I went a year without telling a single soul and another year before telling an adult about it. I had counselling at 14 and it took me 3 sessions before I actually told her anything other than small talk. I have always had immense trouble talking about any problems I have whether it be mental health or just that I made a small mistake, I even have a trouble just telling people that I am having a bad day which causes me to just lash out at them and this has been causing me current issues with my job and relationship. I think the biggest issue that I have is when I need to talk to people about an emotional problem or something like an argument I just cant think of anything to say. it feels like my throat has closed up and I genuinely cant think of how to put my thoughts and feelings into words and even if I do know the answer and what I want to say there is so much anxiety that is built up to the point where I cant force myself to just. say. it. this greatly frustrates my boyfriend of 6 years he really just does not understand it and we have had times when I am obviously upset about something and he sits down to ask me what is wrong and I start crying but I cant tell him and we are just sat there in silence while he waits for me to say something and I am just there trying think of something to tell him. do you ever panic when you cant find the right amount of change and you know you have it but you can quite find it and you have the cashier waiting and maybe a couple people behind you and the more time it takes the more stressed you get making it harder for you to find what you are looking for? that is what it feels like. its not that I do not want to say it or I am scared to say it (well sometimes I am scared because then you have to deal with the reaction from the other person) I just cant. really I just want to know if anyone on here has experienced a similar thing and if i can actually have a name to put to it. I read another post where someone said it was like going blank and i really feel that. apologies that this is so long and basically a life story. Thank you. Wow this is spot on lmao! I have gotten better about speaking in general but I have such a hard time speaking about my feelings or any topic I feel might cause tension. This is not just with speaking irl or on the phone even, it is with texting too. I just tend to avoid any topics like that. When I do speak up about my feelings, I just break down and get super anxious and start crying or get frustrated because I cannot figure out how to say the things that are in my brain or cannot figure out what I am even feeling. \nThis is exactly what I am struggling with right now and started talking to a therapist via BetterHelp and see how things go.. yep.. I just go blank. If you have the ability to, try to schedule a psychological + physical assessment.\n\nMental health is a WIDE spectrum, and you want to rule out any controllable factors (hormone levels, nutritional deficiencies, etc).\n\nOnce the controllable factors are ruled out, then you really just want to know what is wrong, even if it is not necessarily \"curable\".\n\nADHD, autism, major depressive disorder, major anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder,  etc. It could be any, all, or a combination of some of the above.\n\nOnce you have the assessment and the diagnosis, that is when you can start working on a treatment plan to how to work with that in your life, rather than trying to live your life in spite of it.\n\nI say this as someone who has been diagnosed with PTSD, CPTSD, Autism spectrum disorder This is EXACTLY how I feel. It is freaky how similar my issues are.... I want to tell my parents about this so bad but I cannot :( I have almost done it. She asked me about why I do not tell her about my problems and I said \u201cI just cannot\u201d bc it is true! I physically cannot talk about it, and other things but like you said emotional stuff is probably the worst or anything that involves me actually I am not really sure but I will say that those two things are reoccurring.", "16M Just want to talk to some people and make some friends since most of you probably have SM too.
