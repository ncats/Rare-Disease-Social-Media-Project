["In remembrance Several months ago, a fellow member connected with me seeking resources for in-home IVIg therapy. \nWe connected and I helped him navigate the process. During that time he became one of my closest friends. He started therapy, but sadly it did not start soon enough. u/thebigtripper succumbed to Covid a few weeks ago- I was able to meet my friend for the first time at his funeral. \nI am thankful for this community for connecting me to someone who made such an impact on my life. I thought I was helping me, but he ended up helping me also. \nI will forever look after his family- to check on his wife and three children. I know he would do the same for me. \nI pray health and safety to each and everyone of you and celebrate the lives of those who are no longer living in sickness in their earthly bodies. Terrible. I am so sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc97 I am so sad to hear about this tremendous loss, but I am happy that you were privileged to know him. You are doing him a tremendous service seeing after his family. I just noticed he had a Decepticon logo on his profile. Did the 2 of you happen to share interest in Transformers? I have a son, so of course! That is awesome! I have been a transformers fan since I was a kid, and have experienced a big resurgence of interest during my adulthood at least 3 times. I Indoctrinated my daughter into TF culture when she was very young, her favorite is Beast Wars. I am currently binging the G1 series. Nice to meet you. So sorry once again for the loss of your newfound friend. Does not seem fair on so many levels! I am so sorry to hear of this loss.  You served your friend well and continue to do so.", "Just started treatment Hey everyone. After years of feeling sub par, constant throat/sinus infections, crazy fatigue, and major sinus surgery to remove polyps, i was diagnosed with CVID. 5 days ago I started IVIG treatment, and it has totally knocked me. Every muscle hurts, I feel dizzy and struggle to focus, I am exhausted, and I am really dehydrated. \n\nIn classic medical fashion, the registrar I was dealing with basically said not to worry and that he would never heard of people feeling particularly rough afterwards, but then when I finally met my supervising specialist on the day of treatment, she said it was going to be a pretty rough few days, and take 6 months or so before I start to really feel better. I was just wondering about your experiences after the infusions, and how long the side effects hang about for you? \n\nThanks! I imagine everyone is different when it comes to this, so take personal experience with a grain of salt.  \n\nFor me, yes, it took about 6 months before I started to feel \"better\".  I imagine if you look around there are a lot of things people will suggest (plenty of water, etc.).  When I did IVIG it was done over 2 days, once a month.  I usually felt \"worn down\" the follow day.  \n\nCurrently I have switched to Sub-Q IG -- that is where YOU stick the needles into your stomach (the fat) and get the medicine that way.  It is once a week for me (I do Sundays, and mondays I still feel a little bleh).  I bring this up because when I started CVID and IVIG, no one even told me about the other options until some time had passed.  I much prefer this way as I cannot stand needles and this does not require a nurse.   Still needles, but this just feels different then being in the veins for me. Thanks Bitterbrew. Yeah I guess that is a tough thing with this, everyone has wildly different reasons and symptoms of CVID.\n\nI have been told that I could possibly switch to sub cutaneous after that 6 month period, but that here in NZ they are much harder to get hold of, so the patient really needs justification. There is no way I could have worked over the last few days, so I would be pretty nervous about weekly doses. I am definitely still getting to grips with the whole situation, but really glad to have a route forward towards \u2018health\u2019.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience! Hey Kiwi Bro ...\n\nIt takes time for it to kick in . Im on West Island ... My fist few IVIG were entertaining , but it got easier . I am now on sub-Q and jab myself weekly . No where near the infections I used to get , but still get them . Was side lined with a \"Virus\" in late Oct 2019 , isolated in hospital for a week , pnumonia and twice again over the next couple of months requiring hospital stays, lost my smell , hair fell out , just the usual symptoms for a \"Virus \" . Dr says RSV ..hmmm , we wont know . \n\nStay strong and give Jacinta a hug from me ! After my first IVIG, I had a 3-day migraine. I learned Vern quickly that it is incredibly important to hydrate before, during, and after. V8 juice is great for this, if you can drink it. Some people hate it but I can get it down if it is room temp and low sodium. I did about 6 months if IVIG and now I do SubQ every 2 weeks. If you can handle putting needles in your thighs or lower belly, then it is so much easier and more convenient, IMO. I also could not stand being trusted to an IV and the smell of the saline flush for the IV made me nauseated and dizzy because it reminded me of being in the hospital. I do not even feel the needles in my stomach once their in and my entire infusion on takes 3 hours start to finish and it is all in my own home and on my schedule. I make it a self-care night and order in food and watch a couple movies or binge a really good show. I am usually tied a day or two afterward and then I feel good. It has taken some time, a drug change, and a dosage increase and I feel the best I have felt in many years. I have been doing this 8 years now and I am so thankful to have my infusions. Hang in there and try different things to see what works for you and makes you feel your best. Good luck and feel free to DM if you have any questions. Also, do not forget to utilize My IG Source and copay assistance from whatever company\u2019s IG you receive. Thanks so much, and I am really glad that it is working for you. Love the self care regimen too, that is the way to do it! I definitely messed up on the hydrating beforehand and during. I felt so weird during the infusion I really did not drink enough. Woah, that sounds like a hell of a ride, sorry you had to go through that. Seems like people are really preferring the sub-Q over the IV. \n\nHaha unfortunately no hugging Jacinda, we are in full lockdown! It is hard.  I personally switched because the nurse told me that prolong IV would cause my veins to have issues which sounded bad.  You hear so many different things it can be a massive headache.  Beats the hell out of the alternative though, for me I kept getting Pneumonia and that is not something you want to keep getting. You can say that again! The alternative sucks, so I am full steam ahead. Means a lot to know others are having a better time later on though. I learned very quickly how important it is to hydrate and take the right premeds. Welcome to the CVID club! Much like u/bitterbrew, I am on sub-Q IG, because I struggled with the side effects of IVIG. (The final straw was a home health nurse doubling the speed of my IVIG infusion, which gave me aseptic meningitis.)  But I know plenty of people who prefer IVIG, because it is only once a month. No matter what route you take, it will be a while before you find your new \"normal.\"  I am 13 years in to infusing -- I do it every Sunday night, and do not feel a thing on Monday morning.  \n\nIn my group of CVID'ers, we always tell newbies the following about IVIG:\n\n1. Start SLOW.  If you do not feel well during the infusion, or the side effects are difficult, it is okay to ask that they slow down the infusion rate and build up over time.\n2. Pre-meds are key in the beginning -- are they giving you steroids, saline, headache meds, etc.?\n3. Hydrate well the day before and the day of.\n\nGood luck! Wow, I am glad you came out of that ok. Aseptic meningitis cannot have been a pleasant experience. Yeah they went pretty slow (by their measure) this time, but I am definitely going to let them know for the next one. The side effects have been pretty heavy, but I also wonder if that is also to do with how much lingering infection I had, so my body is just trying to catch up. I 100% did not hydrate enough before or during, and they offered me some ibuprofen/acetaminophen and an antihistamine but said it was not really necessary, so I did not take it. Live and learn I guess! Thanks for sharing. Is it hard to learn how to self inject? Do you need a lot of power in your hands in order to do so? I am truly curious. It is not difficult to learn. There are a lot of steps but a nurse will walk you through it all. No, you do t need much strength, a pump does the infusion for you. The main part where you might need strength in your hands is drawing up the plasma into the syringes, however that is much easier done with mini-spikes bs needles. Your specialty pharmacy should send you the mini-spikes without asking for them, hopefully. Sticking yourself with the needles is not terrible. You can also request number cream to make it easier if you struggle. The needles are sharp so you should not need much strength to get them in. Sub Q &gt; IVIG\n\nBoth treatments still makes me feel crap though It is a week on and I am still feeling pretty rough, but definitely feeling more vaguely human adjacent now. How long do you feel bad after? I never really feel 100% to be honest\nwith you but if you do it long enough it becomes the norm Yeah, it is been long enough since I felt totally \u2018well\u2019 that I am just looking forward to the improvement. I hope that it keeps getting better for you It took about 6 months for me to feel better but I think it has to build for awhile . Changed the last 12 years of my life for the better. Definitely stay encouraged. Thanks for sharing positive vibes! Every bit of hope is a big deal, so I really appreciate it. For sure! Stay in touch if you need a friend. We are in this together. Thank you, I just had another treatment and it only took me 5 days to feel pretty ok this time, and the symptoms were not as bad, so definitely feeling positive! That is great! For me, the effects lessened in days every time. I am sure your body will get used to it and then when you get healthy and strong you will never turn back. I cannot wait for you to feel that!", "Newly Diagnosed / Struggling to adjust. Any tips? I am a lucky son of a bitch - I say that because at 32 I survived a rare form of blood cancer, which is more than I can say for my immune system. Medically I am well taken care of, but with my condition being a bit more on the extreme side I am restricted in things I can do/where I can go due to risk on infection from exposure (even with IG).\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this, or similar, and if so do you have any tips for how to manage?\n\nI miss being social, working in an office/studio setting, and general in person contact with other people.", "How can Covid impact the life of people with Primary Immunodeficiency (Research - please participate) My girlfriend (who has CVID) and I are working on a short public research about how is Covid impacting the life of people with Primary Immunodeficiency. \n\nAs you can see (from a sample dashboard below) we gathered some data from 23 participants, but of course, there is not much use of it if we do not get more participants. I believe this groups are the best place to come and share such projects with and for zebras.\n\nOne of the answers we try getting from the research is if having Covid would give a more clear picture about the long/short term effects for individuals with PI.\n\nWe plan to expand the report and share it publicly with you and other online communities interested in PI. Here is a small sample to give you the idea how it is going to look like. \n\nFor all that are willing to participate, please find the survey here: \n\nAlso, likes, shares and comments will increase the exposure which should allow us to get more answers into the pool. Every ounce (grams for people from EU) of support will make us happier.\n\nThank you so much!\ud83d\ude4f Take care! \ud83e\udd70 Thanks been trying to find the affects of COVID for CVID but it is hard to understand  My daughter has CVID + Bonus DKC for an extra f you from the universe.  So far tho she has had almost 30 covid tests and has tested negative every time. She did have an autoimmune reaction that attacked and almost shut down her lungs, but even during all of that time, with a covid patient on the opposite side of the ward and everything she never caught it.\n\n\nMaybe we are just lucky, imo it is just another stressor to worry about that has not really affected us much. It is varied.  Appears you can have a less severe cytokine storm when you have less of an immune system.  I had it and the course was mild and I have cvid. Bud I can safely say what I have are not mild", "Need to Vent about Health Insurance I just need a space to vent about my new health insurance, and I do not know where else to go. \n\nI am a new federal employee, and I was really careful about picking my new plan. It is a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, the best that you can get. I picked it in part because BCBS considers my current specialty pharmacy for my CVID medication as an in network pharmacy. The federal BCBS website literally says to go to the BCBS state site for more information, which is where I found this info.\n\nNew plan was supposed to be set up on Monday, but BCBS lost my enrollment paperwork. I was not in the system until Friday, which means no insurance cards sent out until Friday. And I would run out of medicine last Sunday (and that is with stretching it, skipping other doses). But, ok, finally in the system. Great. \n\nWell then, BCBS refuses to give me the member ID over the phone. Instead they say, go ahead and get the medicine, they will pay on the back end. Only, the medicine requires prior authorization, and the pharmacy will not dispense without prior authorization. Oh and you need all the plan info, including the member ID, to start that process. Again, insurance cards were sent late, so I am looking at waiting an additional week for those, maybe longer because of flooding in my areas from a tropical storm. \n\nWell THEN, I am told today that I can only get my medicine through a DIFFERENT specialty pharmacy, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, which apparently has terrible reviews and everyone hates. BCBS says because they contract with Walgreens Prime, Walgreens Prime now has all my insurance info. But of course when I talk to them, they do not (so I guess BCBS is just full of a bunch of liars, because this is now the second tangible lie they have told me, the first was to just go ahead and get the medicine as if the prior authorization would not impede that). \n\nSo, to recap. NOW I do not have any member ID number (so cannot use the plan I am currently paying for), it is unclear when I will get that, still have to go through the prior authorization process, probably have to change pharmacies to one that is apparently terrible, and I am totally out of medicine for my CVID.... in the middle of another pandemic surge .... in a job where I have to go in in person. I am so frustrated, I basically broke down crying while talking to federal employee drug program person embedded in the new pharmacy. I just want to give up on even trying to get this set up. This is my third insurance / pharmacy change in probably the past 4-5 years and it is a nightmare every single time. I just feel so beaten down and cast aside by these companies. Internet hugs. So sorry you have to deal with this. So incredibly frustrating. I am convinced the reason most people are satisfied with our private insurance system is because they do not interact with it very often. That has to be it because I have never heard anyone who actually uses their health insurance as much as we do say anything positive about it. How could you when customer service is literally lying and giving inconsistent information? This may not be possible without a member number but your member number is probably online. You might see if you can register online to access it. So, the funny part about this is that you need the member number to create the online account with the insurance company. BUT, the new pharmacy was able to get it from blue cross. For whatever reason they gave it to them but not me over the phone. So things are progressing!! Oh good!  Just keep a close eye on the pre-authorization process and be the squeaky wheel.", "IgA, IgM, and IgA numbers low...next steps Hey all! Thanks in advance for your consideration. I am pregnant with an autoimmune disease, recently had my bloodwork done and my doctor said I am immunoglobulin deficient and I have a referral to an immunologist who I am just waiting to hear back from. They checked me for immunity to childhood illnesses for which I was vaccinated-- no immunity there. GI issues are my main frustration. I am just sitting here, waiting for a call so I get some answers and an appointment.  I am wondering what testing and steps you all went through in the process of getting a diagnosis. To be honest you would be much better joing one of the several CVID groups on Facebook as this sub is very rarely visited.\n\nAs for me, I have ITP and needed emergency IVIG treatment to get my platelets up.\n\nAfter the treatment my Hemo noticed that my IG numbers were low considering the treatment I had gone under.\n\nThey tested me for different cancers, HIV and a whole host of other conditions.\n\nEverything came back clear and I was diagnosed with CVID.\n\nThis was about 10 years ago but as far as I am aware it is still the case of ruling everything else out until your left with CVID Thanks!! I appreciate the insight. I was diagnosed by a rheumatologist, not an immunologist. He tested my blood for every autoimmune disorder and immune deficiency he possibly could. He found all 5 types of IGs were undetectable (this was back in 2019). I was referred to an allergist/immunologist and was started on two IVIG treatments pretty much right away. \n\nI was hospitalized mid-August 2019 and diagnosed early September 2019. I received my first IVIG in mid-September. I was supposed to do a titers blood test to see if I could form immunity but was given the wrong vaccines by the doctor's office and my immunologist said they did not want me to wait 8 weeks to try again, so I began treatment right away. I did my two IVIG treatments then switched to SQIG. I have been on HyQvia for almost a year and a half now. Np, hope everything goes well They tested me by giving me a low dose of a pneumonia vaccin and see if I made any antibodies. And which antibodies I made. CVID is often found due to recurring symptoms/infections that do not go away with normal treatment or come back shortly after it ends. When I was diagnosed nearly 20 years ago, they were treating me for a sinus infection I still had after 9 months and 7 different antibiotics, despite being young and otherwise healthy. Diagnosis is usually very much a matter of ruling everything else out, as another had noted. It sounds like you may have found this out much earlier than you would have without your recent bloodwork, and that is great news as hopefully it will help you better understand unexplained symptoms and get you some newfound relief. As for next steps, your immunologist will help you determine that, as CVID cases are very complex and different from person to person. If your IGG numbers are below the normal range, they will likely suggest immunoglobulin replacement by IV or subcutaneous injection. This process can unfortunately be longer than we all would like due to health insurance practices. People with CVID are more likely to encounter autoimmune and other disease, but CVID itself is manageable in many cases, and many people live long and relatively normal lives with regular treatment and lifestyle changes to mitigate new infection.\n\nBest of health to you, and best wishes on your pregnancy. Please go to this site and register for this event, it is today in a couple of hours...  I believe they also make recordings available afterwards.  The Immune Deficiency Foundation should be your gateway to an organization that fosters a strong community supporting PI patients and their families. \n\n(\n\nI expect this to be much better information than I could provide you in a Reddit reply.\n\nWoody Thanks so much for sharing and the info. Hope you are feeling better these days! Thanks for all of this! And the reminder that it is manageable. I really appreciate all the information. Ah interesting and thanks for letting me know. I just got tested for anTibodies for which I have received vaccines\u2014no immunity. Thanks again! I am just going through investigation too with undetectable iga, igm and significantly low igg. They found out as I had no celiac antibodies in October when investigating fatigue.  I do not have the gi issues with it just a 10 year history of 3 month long colds/coughs/ear/sinus issues and chest infections.  The referral did not take long at all as the immunologist called me the same day because the ig's were so low.  I started prophylactic antibiotics to get through the winter before full diagnosis and treatment.\n\nA week later I had a repeat ig test at the hospital along with t/b/nk cells, euroclass class b switched, antibodies for tetanus/haemophilus/thyroid (I have autoimmune hypothyroidism), pneumoccocal serotypes, hep c, crp and all the usual kidney/liver/bone/cbc/vit D/b12/ferritin/folate tests.\n\nA month later in Dec Immunoproliferative blood test (prob as result of last bloods but do not really know) and a ct-tap to check lungs/liver/spleen/lymph nodes/thymus (all clear). \n\nSo far that is as far as it is got as this week I found out the Immunoproliferative blood sample had gone to the wrong hospital and the gp did not know that the results had not come back (11 weeks ago \ud83d\ude48), they tracked them down and sent them to the consultant today (all normal fortunately!!) so hopefully things start moving again now.  I have not had any updates on the bloods done at the hospital yet so not sure if I need the vaccine challenge or if they know enough from the antibody tests they have already done.  \n\nGood luck with your diagnosis, hope it is faster than mine though they do need to rule out other causes before they classify it as CVID. I have heard some say upto 6 months and others a month.\n\nI am glad I am in the UK and do not have to deal with the insurance issues abroad as it looks like that delays treatment too. This is similar to my story. Had bloodwork done for stomach and GI issues and found low immunoglobulins across the board. I had not been overly ill with infections but definitely stayed sick longer than my friends ever did. \nYou will likely do the vaccine challenge for an official CVID diagnosis with the pneumonia vaccine. They will grab your current titers (which sounds like they have), give the vaccine, then test again later. From there I would suspect you will start treatments for IgG replacement. \nI am going on 10 years, including treatment through a pregnancy. You can do this! This is totally manageable and should not affect living a mostly normal life. They might give it to you again even if you have had it. They tested my titers before the vaccine and after and found that my body literally had no response, so they tacked on a \"selective antibody deficiency\" on me as well. \n\n\nAs for treatment, I initially was started on IVIG but switched to subcutaneous a couple weeks ago and am incredibly happy with that decision. Just to give an example timeline of the wait for treatment.\n\nSetting up for IVIG actually took me about 2-3 months with the amount of health insurance stuff (although this was also during the pandemic). It also took a couple months to learn how exactly I needed to take care of my body before/after infusions (such as pre-medicating for 24 hrs before).\n\nSetting up for SQIG was about three weeks. I will say this transition has been incredibly easy, even the \"sticking yourself with needles\" part, because it does not hurt as much as you think it might, at least for me). This timeline is consistent with mine. I also had a few 4-6 month pauses in treatment over the years due to issues with renewing the insurance precertification, as well as shortages on immunoglobulin. Insurance is a pain, but I recognize that I would not have immunoglobulin without it and am very respectful of that. Yes! I just had an issue where my insurance told both me and the infusion company that they were in-network. Even have the documentation they sent both of us saying as much. Even their \"find a doctor\" thing said they were in-network *for my specific plan.*\n\nThen it turns out, \"well they are in-network for some of our plans but not others\". Basically, they were in network for the cheaper plans my insurance company had, but not the top level one we gut (because we max our out of pocket every year, so went for the one with the lowest out of pocket because despite being more expensive per month, it was still cheaper overall). \n\nThey did not catch this for like 4 months, and then one day I got a bill for $10k (which actually ended up being $40k because that was just the bill for Septembers treatment that was not sent to me until almost January). \n\nI call the insurance and they tell me that it is in network and its likely the company used the wrong billing code. They told the company that they were not actually in-network for my plan. Suddenly the \"find a doctor\" thing starts listing them as \"out of network\". \n\n\nWe came back with the paperwork the insurance had sent listening my treatment as in network, insurance says they *might* waive the out-of-network designation for this, but I had to switch infusion companies (so I made the switch to SQIG since it was a convenient time anyway).\n\n\nStill not entirely sure what happened or is going to happen, but the infusion place said I would not be held liable for any balance my insurance does not pay, since the infusion company signed a contract with me that listed my fee as zero (I had hit my \"in network\" out if pocket max which is what they used to quote me, and I would not have agreed to treatment if I had been quoted otherwise). But I think they are trying to work with the insurance company to get paid. Have not heard anything for over a month so guess it is all good.", "Could this be CVID? I visited my allergist who did some immune system tests as a follow up to my asthma. The following results were flagged. Does this seem like CVID? Could the low IgG be a fluke? I have also been on steroids for three of the last five weeks for an asthma flare up. Could that be causing the low IgG levels?\n\n\nIgE (H): 142 kg/UL (reference range is below 104 \nIgG: (L): 472 (600-1640) \nIgA: 104 (47-310) \nIgM: 65 (50-300)", "I cannot do this anymore. TW suicidal \n\nI feel like giving up. The cvid has been wreaking nothing but havoc, even on IVIG I constantly have some type of infection, usually sinus. Monday I was diagnosed with PCOS and told I probably will not be able to have children if I wanted them. Today I went to my ENT and her told me I have another major infection and I most likely will need sinus and septum surgery. My therapist of THREE YEARS is no longer accepting insured patients, and I need to find a new psychiatrist too. Monday I am going to see a neurologist for possible MS and I have to schedule a follow up for a POTS tilt test. I am dying. I am not dying, but I feel like a walking, talking piece of useless garbage. I know my life is \u201cworth living\u201d or whatever, but I am so close to giving up. I applied for disability and they told me that because when I applied I made over $1300 in a month, that I would not get approved. I cannot possibly be disabled with multiple chronic illnesses and bipolar disorder BECAUSE I MADE LESS THAN MY MONTHLY RENT. I am ready to give up. You are not alone.  Know that.  \n\n\n\n\n\nYa know those things you read about where someone finds their magic bullet and it radically changes their life in a good way?  Getting your septum done (if applicable), turbinates, etc., is HUGE for most people suffering from sinusitis.  Do what it takes to have this done.  Not for all, but most, find massive relief here.\n\nChin down, head up.  You got this.\n\nI have had to learn to accept (  And in time, I did.  And now cherish it. Look I am going to be honest here, nothing I will say will help out your situation or do I understand what your going though.\n\nBut I can tell you your not alone and I have also had thoughts of ending it due to CVID but you cannot let it win and someone will miss you but right now it might not seem like it but it might get better. And I know that is not the thing you want to hear buts you need to hear it so please do not end it. Hey there!! Personal trainer with CVID here. You have the ability to change your life and I know you can do it, and I KNOW it will get better. No I hope or I wish or maybe. But I KNOW.\n\nIt is amazing the affect our diet and exercise can have. In fact a study just came out that meeting the minimum recommended exercise guidelines reduces the risk of dying by covid in half. Additionally exercise has been proven to be as effective as anti depressants. You have a ton going on now physically, but there are things you absolutely have total control over! You can control your diet and movement. Even if it is just a 10 minute walk around the neighborhood every day, start moving more. Even if it is just 2 salads a week and less sugar on Thursdays you can do it. \n\nI felt horrible when I drank a ton, ate a ton and did not exercise. Inside and out I felt bad, mentally and physically. \n\nI have love for you and everyone going through hard times. They say if you are suicidal it is not that you want to end your life, you want to end the pain you are in. I read that when I was suicidal once and it resonated with me. \n\nUse this as an opportunity to change your life. Let this be the before- and the after is still to come. It is not easy, if it were then everyone would do it. But I 100% believe in you. \n\nHang in there and keep us updated, ok?? And take change and kick ass like the badass you are. That is A LOT to take in at once. A lot. And I am sorry you are feeling the way you are. The toll of chronic illness on mental health is no joke. It is so taxing. Do what you can to take this one day at a time, one thing at a time. \n\nWhat is the most pressing thing you can address? \n\nAlso, idk your health details obviously (and I am not asking), but pcos is generally considered a common and treatable cause of infertility. Could be worth getting a second opinion. \n\nReally sucks having to find a new therapist, I hope you end up with one with whom you end up liking even more/getting more out of the sessions.\n\nSorry that everything feels so crappy right now.\n\n\nIf it is any help, both my sister and I have been tested for MS.  Came back negative (and we are high risk for it due to having another autoimmune disease). So, it is super stressful to get tested\u2014100%. You might not get the news you are dreading. \n\nAnything fun/relaxing/recharging you can do? Maybe get lots of sleep, go outside, see a good friend and eat good food? \n\nReally sorry you are dealing with all of this, especially at one time. Hi there, I normally do not post but I really relate to you. I have been through almost all the same exact diagnoses and I know what it feels like to have it all piled on. You can and will get through this. \n\nI have CVID, mental health issues, and diagnosed with both PCOS and POTS. And also have had sinus and tonsil surgery. If I can offer some support\u2014 take each day at a time and know you are not alone. It is too much to think of it all at once so I compartmentalize for my own sanity. Feel what your feeling but know you are stronger than what you come up against. \n\nI also thought PCOS= no kids but my doctor has told me not to worry at all. She has had more people accidentally get pregnant with PCOS than try to and not get pregnant. It is hard because you will not know until you try but I hear there are inexpensive ways to help as well and it is not necessarily an IVF type path. I know this is an emotional one but I would try to \u201cworry about it later\u201d and know there are interventions. Eff the doctor for saying that because not being able to have kids bc of PCOS is so wrong. \n\nFor ten years, I was told I needed sinus surgery by ENTs. I finally got it and yes feel better, but it is not a medical emergency type item. \n\nI have had autoimmune stuff and my mom has MS. If you have MS type symptoms that is definitely worth getting checked out. It is possible the POTS symptoms/CVID are adding up too. \n\nHealth care is great but sometimes I feel like they are looking for problems so they get paid! Honestly would prioritize your most urgent appointments and put other things on the back burner...\n\nFor the psychologist stuff, you usually can have them provide a \u201csuper bill\u201d even if they do not take insurance and insurance may reimburse you for a portion. There are also usually good low or no cost options locally or via tele health now. \n\nRe disability, I do not know as much but my mom receives disability for her MS even though my dad makes a good salary. Maybe search for tips on the best way to go about this? Sometimes with those government things you just have to try multiple times. \n\nHang in there!! You are not alone and you can get through this. Lean on the people in this group. It may sometimes feel like people in your life do not understand and appreciate what you are going through, but there are many caring people in this group who have walked in similar shoes and can help you get through it--one step at a time. I agree with you to a point. Things can get better, but the pain will not go away. I have CVID and have been on weekly infusions for 12 years. I lost 80 pounds in the last two years. I make sure to walk 10,000 steps a day and in good weather I ride my bike at a minimum of 5 miles a day. This loss of weight and added activity has helped me a little bit. I have to do all my exercising prior to 10 a.m. because it is hard to do between 10 and 2 pm and impossible to do after 2. By 4:00 I am sitting with a heating pad anxiously awaiting the time I can take my pain meds. I do notice I sleep better (still with sleeping pills) but I no longer wake from pain. Exercise and getting to the correct weight has helped, but for me it has not been a cure all. Hang in there! Once a week on infusion day, I want to crawl out of my skin because it hurts so bad. Does that happen to others after their infusions? Most days I am on the couch under my weighted blanket with a heating pad by 4:00. I have been fighting pain for 20 years and I have been infusing once a week for 12 years. If you are still getting infections, it seems like they need to up your infusion dose? I was told by an ENT that I have a deviated septum and needed surgery. My immunologist said I should not get the surgery. While it might help, the risks of infection is not worth the risk. I also need cataract surgery which he also wants me to put off as long as I can. That one is getting harder since I cannot see well. I went to a very respected immunologist at Mass General in Boston when I lived there. He doubled my infusion dose because he had research that showed in 50% of the cases it helped decrease pain. I moved about a year after he started that. My new immunologist did not agree and cut me back to my normal dose. So I really cannot say if that truly would work. Hang in there! I think we all sometimes feel like giving up. I have asked my husband..is this as good as it gets for me? I want to travel, but I know it is too hard for me. I would love to have one pain free day...I cannot even imagine! Hugs to you!! I am soooooo glad you are getting those steps in, amazing and admirable!! I definitely know it is not a cure all but think how much worse off you would be without it. \n\nOk have you tried saffron tea? Be open minded. A lot of studies have shown it is super effective for depression, anxiety and pms but it is an herb so not marketed. I put about 10 to 20 threads in a cup, add booking water and let it sit a while then drink everything in the cup. I know that is super random but it will not hurt to try! The effect is within hours not days too. Xoxox Hello,\n\nJust wanted to chip in and say you are not alone.  I too am sick of this disease.  I am constantly fatigued, feel like a weird mental and physical fog making me feel generally unwell.  If I do not force myself to stay awake I could easily lay in bed all day and sleep.  I also have a weird symptom of CVID where I have a terrible body odor, GI thinks it is my bodies inability to fight off bacterial overgrowth within my body.  Do sub q every week which makes me depressed everytime I stand there poking those needles into my body.  I do not even remember what it feels like to feel okay and not depressed.  Do not know how I am going to survive in the near future and function I really feel like my body is slowly shutting down.  Feel worse every year even with treatment, IVIG, sub q both do not seem to make me feel better.  I am thinking of giving up soon too, I am just tired you know? Thank you for this honesty. Today I was told there is yet another problem with my insurance and I spent the entire days sick and throwing up. All of this after my father telling me the reason I have so many problems is because I am in a spiritual deficit, which was basically just him saying it is because I am not a Christian. If I did not have so many responsibilities and people that I know loved me I would have ended it a long time ago. This shit be hard af Hang in there. I infuse every night. For the rest of my life. Keep trying! Do not give up. Alright we are going to try and do this in order-I def feel you, friend, but really you kind of just got to. No quitting allowed. Covid is a little jerk. I am allergic to IVIG so, I dunno. \n\nPCOS does not automatically mean no kiddos ever.. I was diagnosed in \u201809 and while it can make it more difficult to conceive from go for sure, I do have an 8 yr old son. \n\nWeird- what did Health insurance ever do to them? Prayers for negative results across the board. POTS tilt test? (Yea, yea, yea- Google) salary aside it. Its not uncommon to kicked back the first or even second time around. \n\nThey kicked me back too which feels like a pretty stupid waste of time and money. The government (army) already acknowledged my total and permanent disability at 100% service connected, The lady said I would be, presumably just bc. The average was like 3 applications. \n\nI dunno, but maybe try applying again. I know it sucks to feel like all that work for naught. But once it is done, it is done and eventually all that weight will slide right off your shoulders. I have CVID. I infuse everyday Gammagard SUBQ. \nI have felt like you many times.\nDo not give up.\nI know it is hard....we are all here.", "CVID and Covid vaccines.

Disease severity is mostly a function of age and comorbidities.\n\nBased on the available vaccines, those with CVID should receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.  I am consistently hearing that CVID patients should not get the J&amp;J or AZ vaccines due to the viral vectors used.  I have heard people say this advice is out of an abundance of caution.\n\nRegarding T-Cells, all of the vaccines will activate T-Cells.  All of the vaccines will generate a T Cell response.  See this article for recent news on the Pfizer vaccine and T Cell response to variants:   ( .\n\nDoes a strong reaction mean you are producing antibodies, I do not think they know, but this article implies that is possible:   (   This was posted today.  This will also address your question about the basic role of T cells and B cells in virus response.\n\nI have CVID and generated a borderline antibody response to the IGG Spike Protein after completing the Pfizer vaccine process.  They cannot easily test T Cell responses, but my immunologist suggested I likely did have good T Cell response based on my B cells showing some antibodies.\n\nHope this helps\n\nWoody", "I did my Gammagard SUBQ in my left arm.

Exciting! Thanks for creating this! At last. Hopefully word gets around as there are so few places where us folk can get together I know. I do not know about you but I do not really talk to other patients when I am getting an infusion. I am usually to tired and just watch movies or sleep. \n\nI think it is about 1 in 25000-50000 people that have CVID, so not alot of people out there. If you know anyone, please invite them in. No problem, to get things started is there anything you would be willing to share about your condition, diagnosis &amp; treatment, etc?\n\nIt is obviously up to you how much you want to share. For sure! Just found this. Right on time too, right around when we suspected CVID was a month ago I have never even seen someone else with CVID or Dermatomyositis for that matter. I actually had not so much as heard of them before I was diagnosed. It is been a wild ride that feels like it could fall off the tracks any second now. Anyone know what caused yours?", "What is your immunologist's goal trough level? For those of you who have been on IgG replacement therapy **for many years,** what is your immunologist's goal trough level for you? Have you had multiple immunologists with different opinions?\n\nI was diagnosed 21 years ago and have been on replacement for nearly as long, and I recently switched doctors. My old doctors have wanted me to be above 1000. This doctor is fine with it a few hundred lower than that. My last two immunologists have both treated to the level where I do not have an excessive amount of infections and did not put much weight into the actual trough level. I have not had IgG troughs drawn in over four years and, when it was drawn in 2017, it was in the 1400s. Even with that high of a trough, though, he did not adjust my dose since I was getting breakthrough infections with a lower dose.\n\nSince you are curious about DX date, I was diagnosed in 2007 (I was a teenager when I was diagnosed) and immediately placed on IVIG. I have been on IVIG for about 20 years, and my doctor was happy when I recently reached 800. I am generally between 700 and 850. I have a history of breakthrough infections on a lower dose than 1000, too. He seems content to wait until I get more infections to increase the dose again. I am concerned, to say the least, but I am having trouble finding another immunologist. I have been on treatment for 20 years subQ for 17 or so. I am around 750ish minimal infections. I know I am on the low end here. I just do sub q every weekend, regardless of my levels, I have accepted it is just a part of my life at this point. My immunologist said that the therapeutic range is based on an individual level and not necessarily a range. So if your infections are low and side effects are low, then the dose is appropriate. Would only raise it if you kept getting sick. That being said, mine is usually between 1K and 1200 I have a history of breathru infections under 1000, curious to know where the threshold is for others. My IgG without replacement is usually in the low 200s. I just this year hit the mid 900s after starting a few years ago at the low 300s, but the ultimate goal my immunologist set is 1000 or higher. I find anything below 800 is leaving room for breakthrough infections for me personally. The IDF has an immunologist referral program. It may be worth checking out if you live in the USA (not sure if it is international or not).", "Allergy/immunology doc ran immune blood work My MBL came back low, and my Pnemococcus IgG antibody panel had 14 of the 23 serotypes come back below normal. \nThe nurse called and said they would likely treat me earlier on w antibiotics, and have me get the pneumococcal vaccine.\nMy concern however is I am beyond the 6 month Mark for my Covid vaccine, and when I get sick I get very sick. I have been extremely cautious but I have kids in school, a husband who travels, so our risk is not zero. \nI have gotten very sick since I was little, frequent chest colds, sinus infections, recurring ear infections. If I get a mild cold my whole family gets, I end up much worse with a lingering deep cough that sometimes requires antibiotics or an inhaler. \nI have not spoken to the doc yet just the nurse or medical assistant who called. I asked her about the Covid vaccine booster since im very concerned with getting Covid since I already know how my body reacts to a regular cold/virus.  Waiting on the return call. \nIf I had gotten Pfizer I would have gone and done the booster already since im 7 months out. But I got Moderna. Anyone else have this experience? Advice? 1.  I am not sure what MBL is, can you expand?\n2. Re the booster.  Did you get IGG spike antibody testing done after the first two doses?  If yes, how did you respond?\n3. In the U.S. an immune compromised person can get a Moderna third dose now based on the FCC and CDC advice.\n\nWoody Mannose Binding Lectin \nThey did not check my spike protein from the vaccine. If you can even think of any follow up questions I could ask my doc id appreciate it since I do not know where to begin with this stuff. Are you seeing an immunologist?  Have you been diagnosed with CVID? Are you on immune globulin treatment?  When I say immunologist I do not mean someone who primarily sees patients for allergies.  I need to know where to start in terms of questions for you to ask...\n\nI have no experience with MBL deficiency but found this information on the immune deficiency foundation website;  (\n\nIn that document I found this... \"Deficiencies of the Lectin Pathway Components  \nMBL, M-ficolin, L-ficolin, H-ficolin, CL-11, MASPs NOTE - This section has been rewritten by the IDF Medical Advisory Committee 5/1/16 Manose Binding Lectin Deficiency is Not a Primary Immunodeficiency Disease MBL (manose binding lectin) is a part of the lectin pathway of the complement system, one of several different components of our immune defense. The lectin pathway may be first to react before a traditional immune response occurs. It was thought that deficiency of MBL might explain some cases of increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. However, when a test was developed to measure MBL in the blood, it was determined that low or absent MBL is very common, affecting approximately 5-30% of all individuals. Therefore, its absence alone cannot be a cause of serious immunodeficiency or a large portion of the world\u2019s population would suffer from frequent major recurrent and potentially fatal infections. Unfortunately, the MBL test is occasionally still ordered during an evaluation for immunodeficiency and, when the results show MBL to be low or absent, it is wrongly interpreted as indicating the presence of a primary immunodeficiency disorder. By contrast, expert immunologists experienced in caring for PI patients believe that low or absent components of this lectin system, including low or absent MBL, do not cause immunodeficiency by themselves. There is no recommended treatment for low or absent MBL, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy is clearly not indicated for that purpose. It is important to stress that the finding of low or absent MBL does not indicate that the cause for an individual\u2019s infections has been found and that the diagnostic process must continue until the correct diagnosis is determined. In such cases the IDF recommends that referral to an experienced immunologist to assist in the diagnostic evaluation be considered. I would just go to CVS and tell them I needed a covid shot. Get the full dose and call it a day. Any MRNA will serve as a booster, just do not get J&amp;J. My doc basically said since it is Moderna they cannot say get it but if it was Pfizer they would.  Good news is yesterday the fda panel voted to approve Moderna boosters (in half dose of 50 mg I think is the measurement) and on NPr I heard yesterday they are thinking they could be approved for actual distribution in that dose by end of next week! Fingers crossed", "SCIG w/ a low body fat % I just started IVIG but am curious to potentially try SCIG in the future. My doctor mentioned it might be somewhat \"uncomfortable and dysfiguring\" since I have a very small frame (and 5'4) and steadily low body fat. Has any else who is small/lean done SCIG? What was/is your experience? I have been SCIG for about 6 years and years now.\n\nWhilst I am not small framed like yourself and honestly cannot see why your doctor would say its disfiguring.\n\nAs best you will have a number of small lumps at each site which disappear within a hour or so.\n\nI do it 3x per week in my upper arms in the evenings about an hour before I go to bed.\n\nCome the morning there is no sign, honestly you cannot even see where the needle has gone in.\n\nUnfortunately this sub is rarely visited. I would highly recommend joining several of the CVID groups on Facebook as both are very popular. I am not the OP, but could you recommend a Facebook group or two? I am newly diagnosed and interested! \n\n\n\nHopefully they work lol Not disfiguring! You can use your belly or on the top of your leg, even very high above where short shorts would fall. You will get little bumps under the skin. You cannot see them at all..you may just feel a knot when you press on it. Nothing ever shows that anyone would see. SCIG is great during the Covid times! My meds get delivered to my door and I do it all by myself. No more nurses coming into my home for IVIG! Thanks! I am low body fat and have been doing SCIG for years. So has my son. No disfigurement. Hi! I am on Cuvitru and I have a very small frame and low body fat, I also have body dysmorphia so I was very worried about any disfiguring. I infuse in my upper thighs once a week, and have pretty pronounced lumps about the size of a peach on my legs. At first I would infuse in the morning and they would last all day, but I switched to infusing in the evenings and they are almost entirely gone by the time I wake up. I have not found it to be particularly uncomfortable because of my size. This is so so helpful. Thank you. I have struggled with body dysmorphia in the past and was concerned about this, but I too thought infusing in the evenings might help. Thrilled to hear about your experience! I am officially done with IVIG and will be starting SCIG in a week or two. I hope it works as well for you as it does for me!!! I was really really concerned about any effects before I started, but doing it in the evenings has really ameliorated any effects it may have had on my body image. I thought I would have a harder time making peace with it, but as it turns out it is really easy to say \u201cHow cool!!!!! These things help keep me healthy!!!\u201d I affectionately started calling them my leg titties at first, although I do not see them much since switching to evenings.

Does anyone ever get awful recurring yeast infections/ fungal acne? I used to get them once a year or so until I started getting really sick, and then I started getting them more often due to taking so many antibiotics. I also started developing AWFUL fungal acne on my forehead. Obviously this is something I need to see my gynecologist for as well but I am wondering if it has something to do with having cvid? I am not an expert, but this could be CVID. I have recurrent bacterial vaginal infections and tinea versicolor (fungal skin infection) that have since mostly cleared up on IVIG. I mentioned this to my doctor and he did not say one way or another whether they were due to CVID, but the correlation is too strong for me to ignore. \n\nAs for yeast infections, I do know that antibiotics can cause them, so it might not directly be CVID. I am not sure about the fungal acne though. I am a male so yeast infections are not an issue for me but I do have chronic SIBO which reeks havoc in my life.  I also am on and off antibiotics throughout the year which has a host of its own issues.  Along with the intestinal bacterial overgrowth issue, I do get issues with my skin, always dry, cracking, bleeding from pores etc.  CVID is truly very annoying. YES.  I get bleeding pores and skin infections.  I wanted to continue my latest antibiotics because my acne was clearing up.  The immunologist wanted me off them and asked why I wanted to continue.  She said it was not acne, mumbled something in frustration about the dermatologist, and prescribed some creams. I always ask for prescriptions of Diflucan with any prescribed antibiotics, due to being susceptible to yeast infections, by having CVID. This may help you! My primary care provider now knows if she ever prescribes antibiotics, a revolving script for Diflucan goes with it. I am a male and have had yeast infections since I have been sexually active. I practice preventative measures and am very mindful of my hygiene \n. This is most definitely related to immunodeficiency. I actually jut read a medical write up on how there is many immunodeficient lives lost a year due to the minimal (and highly toxic) drugs that are available to fight these infections when they get into the blood, they are so hard to fight. I am actually currently in the middle of this dilemma. I have have been battling a  yeast infection for 3 weeks. My doctor absolutely does not want to give me oral meds due to the toxicity, me just getting off of 4 antibiotics due to a lung infection and a severe bladder infection... throw in the fact my liver is inflamed (fatty) and it is just very scary:(!

Cool. If anyone else has interest, maybe we can make our own group? I was diagnosed 20 years ago and never really found anyone to talk to about it for all this time. I was diagnosed almost 20 years ago as well. I love to mentor people who are new to CVID and other PIs, but I also crave discussion with, and knowledge from, those who have lived with it for awhile. I feel similar I am near the 20-year mark and have talked to many people that are new to CVID but cannot say I have talked to someone who has delt with it with it for some time. Good to know there are more of us around here. I will continue to keep an eye out for more of us and maybe we can form some kind of a group if people want. \n\nI kind of want a space to talk more privately with others like us tbh.

Idk if you guys feel the same or not. &gt;people with severely compromised immune systems out of fear that many will be left behind as the world rushes to return to normal around them while the virus still persists.\n\nThis is what I am concerned about. I think about it every day. Especially with all these anti-vaxxers around. I am in the US btw I live in a U.S. state where very little has been done to protect us. I feel like a prisoner in my own home. I am starting to reach out to local public health officials and media. Hoping to make a difference, even if it is a small one. I am also a CVID old timer, diagnosed sixteen years ago. I have spent the last year mostly stuck at home, waiting for the world to return to some semblance of normalcy and trying to understand this virus and the vaccines that are come out. \n\nOne of the really heartening things that I saw was from the Immune Deficiency Foundation, they say that the RNA vaccines drive T-cell immunity as well as B-cell immunity. So even if your antibody production is not functioning properly, you can still produce the T-cells that will provide some protection from the virus. \n\nSign me up! I tired of being at home. I have been infusing for a year after being diagnosed a couple years ago(got to love insurance), am I still a newbie? In my mind? Yeah.. \n\nI am going on 20 years since I was diagnosed and 17 years infusing. That is 2/3rds of my life and I rarely meet anyone who has had that experience. I appreciate that you are a newbie looking for help and you are having trouble finding it, but the whole point of me looking for this space was so that I would have other oldies to talk to without all the newbies watching and/or asking questions. No offense to newbies intended, but they tend to have a very intense presence and take up all the space with mostly the same questions and concerns. And I cannot speak for others, but even as someone diagnosed 20 years ago I will never feel comfortable giving advice or someone taking advice from my comments. Oh, I am not looking for help, just commiserating about the general lack of online resources! It does sound like the resources you would need are different from what I would need.

I formed antibodies! Received Pfizer two doses 12/18 and 1/8. Found one lab in California that checked for antibodies to the spike protein (vaccine) versus nucleocapsid (infection).

Woohoo!!! That is great news!! Thanks for sharing!! Congratulations Yes, thank you for sharing that is incredible news.  Fingers crossed that is true for all of us. Thank you so much for the update! What kind of antibodies (igg iga igm)? In case other people in CA want to have that checked as well, can you day which lab had the test? IgG. Post has been edited with name, address, and number of lab. Thank you! Do you do IVIG or SCIG? If so, is there a possibility that the IGG your results showed are from your infusions? Also I am curious what your total IGG counts were before your infusions when you were being diagnosed. Neither. My IgG has been in the 300-400s mostly, dropped to 200s during pregnancy but came back up. My main issue is GI problems, however my doctor advised when I start getting sicker to start IVIG. I did not have a response to Pneumovax however. So I know I made these antibodies on my own. Ah ok, so your B cells still produce IgG, although much lower levels than normal. May I ask if you were able to choose whether you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine? Because it seems like Pfizer may be the better option when looking for T cell stimulation. I got it as soon as I could and the only one we had was Pfizer so I took it. If I had waited a week or so I probably could have picked.", "IVIG and steroids Hi! I am new to my CVID diagnosis and new to IVIG. I had my second infusion last week and had a negative reaction (insane migraine and nausea) and as a result had to take some steroids. I have read that some people take steroids every time they get IVIG... but why? Steroids are an immunosuppressant, and we are getting IVIG to strengthen us... correct? Do they cancel each other out? Just trying to better understand the pros and cons if anyone has some insight Steroids suppress different components of the immune system. IVIG is to give us antibodies that we either do not make or seem to lack for an unknown reason. Steroids inhibit a lot of inflammatory things, mostly chemical signalling molecules and things.\n\nGenerally, when you react to IVIG you can consider it almost like an allergic reaction. Your immune system is freaking out over something (probably an odd antibody) and this causes an inflammatory response. Steroids quell these responses.\n\nSome people react very badly to IVIG (i.e. an anaphylaxis response) and need steroids to prevent that. I generally am given tylenol and benadryl, though I take steroids for something else now. Yes different steroids are absorbed in different ways. I have CVID with GI symptoms that mimic inflammatory bowel (crohns, ulcerative colitis, etc). I am taking a daily steroid to help with that but it is an extended release and a delayed release and to my understanding, minimally absorbed by the stomach. Which is good, because less potential for lowering an already suppressed immune system. Ditto to what other commenters have said about steroids suppressing different components of the immune system that do not have bearing on the efficacy of IG replacement therapy. \nTwo additional points:\nMast cells (and sometimes mast cell activation syndrome) tend to play a role in adverse reactions to IVIG. I have an MCAS diagnosis and got aseptic meningitis after my first IVIG, so my doc switched me to SCIG. If you continue to have problems with tolerating IVIG, you are not alone and your doctor should consider switching you to SCIG.\nI will say when it comes to the prevention of IVIG-induced aseptic meningitis, evidence has actually shown that, despite steroids being a go-to for preventing this complication, they are actually not very effective at it. Which is another topic.", "I have CVID and I got the Pfizer COVID vaccine today! Here is hoping my T cells have a response!  What type of CVID? I have an IgG deficiency and I have had zero immune response to various vaccines. Would I be able to form the necessary IgGs to harbour immunity? Good luck.  Fellow cvid here. Low IgG, IgM, and IgA. I was given pneumovax to confirm CVID as I did not form antibodies with that vaccine. My immunologist said it would be safe to receive and that there may be some T-cell imparted immunity so it is worth it for me to try. I am going to have antibodies checked two weeks after second shot and can report back. Oooow men. Do not take the vaccin. They actually say on the medical report supplied with the vaccin that immuno compromised people should not take it. I copied this from the vaccin destributed from the UK: Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have \r\na diminished immune response to the vaccine. No data are available about concomitant use of \r\nimmunosuppressants. I am from the UK and that is the complete opposite of what I have been told. It is not a live vaccine and does generate some t-cell response. It is very similar to the flu jab. Might not do much but certainly will not hurt. Thank you for the work you do AND thank you for posting this. Super curious to hear whether you have a positive antibody response. I also had the pneumovax to confirm CVID \u2014 no antibody response with that, but I did have an injection site reaction that led to a half day in the ER on iv antibiotics! Yeah. I am so sorry for you. Read the documents. I would definitely not touch it. My doctor has read it also and strongly advise against it. ( Have you got a link so I can have a look at it? Thanks It is another quite famous doc in the UK. He also posted a link to download to file. I do not know how to share the report.\n\n( Exactly what the science says. No need to be sorry for me. I jumped at the chance to get it! It is such a privilege. It is my pleasure! Sorry about your site reaction! \ud83d\ude23 That is a matter of perspective I guess. Wish you all the best. Thanks. I noticed the link in another comment and have given it a read and watch. It is says that immunocompromised patients would have a reduced response. This does not mean it is dangerous but may have a reduce effectiveness. This is to be expected as OP stated, hopefully the t-cell response would be enough. I spoke to my immunologist and they say that in some patients t-cells alone fought of Covid so this could be enough\n\nEdit: typos as I am on my phone Hmmm it goes a bit further than that when you look into the reports of the tests of the vaccin. But that is another rabbit hole to go down to. Each for its own, wish you all the best . Well from the report you linked, I did not see any more information regarding immunocompromised patients but as you say each to their own. Good luck and good health to you in the future That is awesome.  My wife has CVID, and we cannot wait for her opportunity to get it. Please keep us updated! I also have the same type of CVID you described. I am sure my doc will need to do my immune labs prior to administering the vaccine, then more labs after injection to check my immune response. \n\nProblem is, due to the Pandemic, I am out of a job &amp; health insurance for the moment, so I am waiting until I get a new position &amp; health insurance to jump in. So frustrating! I definitely would love to hear about your immune response! There is not much data out there for us CVID'ers regarding the covid vaccine :/ Wishing best of luck to your t cells! My CVID is like yours, and I was told to get it for the t cell response when it is available to me. Looking forward to it! Good luck! Stay safe! I will be happy to report back! I plan to get an antibody test two weeks after the second vaccine. Best wishes to you - I hope that everyone, insured and uninsured, have access to a free vaccine in the very near future! It does not actually say not to get the vaccine, it says that there may be a diminished immune response.  Talk to your doctor.\n\n&gt;Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have\na diminished immune response to the vaccine. No data are available about concomitant use of\nimmunosuppressants.\n\n Yeah as I said in another response my doctor says do not use it Any update??? How are you feeling?? Totally fine! Zero side effects other than a mildly sore arm for about 24 hours. Nice! Thanks for the update, be well! How much is Pfizer Paying you to post this? More than yo mama charges probably Nothing....the tracking devices are free \ud83d\ude44 Eat shit. Get that petty conspiratorial nonsense outta here. This type of vaccine can be a huge help to this community. Inject bleach instead of this and save the dose for somebody who has the common sense to get it. You eat shit you fucking Pfizer shill.  Talk to me when you become sterile Women conceived in the studies, so it does not cause sterility. That is just misinformation being spread on Facebook. The people on this CVID board often cannot produce their own antibodies so they desperately need others to get the vaccine and be part of the herd. So instead of wasting your time spreading misinformation on an obscure subreddit your time would be better spent reading the actual outcomes of the studies. Be thankful you can get a vaccine and form antibodies. Most people on this sub would kill for that. Fuck your bullshit lies bot. Hello! I am scheduled to get one tomorrow and am on the fence. Did you generate antibodies? Hello! I am not sure yet. I had my second today and wanted to wait two weeks until after my second to see if I made any antibodies. I have not had any post vax issues so far though. That is such good news! I am happy for you. Tomorrow I am scheduled for my first Moderna, but nervous because I just got off a bunch of antibiotics, have some symptoms lingering and a new swollen lymph node on my neck\ud83d\ude2c I will keep my fingers crossed for you! My wife's CVID sounds just like yours,  as far as her levels.  She got the first dose about a week ago. Excellent! Rooting for you!  I got my second Pfizer shot yesterday!  I hope to get some antibody testing in a couple of weeks to see if anything comes of it.  You might be able to sign up for this study to get yours tested:   ( Wow thank you so much!

", "History 2008 United States Senate special election in Wyoming ", "IVIG question I was diagnosed about a year ago and I am a college student. I stayed at home for the previous semester with my immunologist and did online classes because of Covid and the diagnosis. I went back to campus in the fall where I started using an infusion center for my IGG. However at my last provider my vitals were checked maybe every few hours and I like I assume most people on IVIG get very fatigued during the infusion so I naturally just go to sleep and if I was asleep at my last provider they would come back later for vitals. At my new infusion center my vitals are checked every 30 minutes no matter if I am sleeping or not which gets really irritating since it just leaves me more fatigued. Is there a legitimate reason that they have to check my vitals every 30 minutes, especially since I have never had any adverse effects (besides a fever and lethargy afterwards with my own oral thermometer vs their forehead.) I assume it is company policy. \nAdditional question; since I cannot seem to find an answer besides my own hypothesis, but are there any others who get extremely cold during their infusion and know why it happens? I was thinking it could be a cytokine response but I have no clue. Last one:I am also on Stelara for 3 autoimmune disorders, is there any sort of downside/benefit to taking a immune suppressant (stelara) with a immune booster (IVIg)? Sorry for the questions just genuine curiosity.", "Did you have vaccine side effects? Had my first dose (Moderna) Thursday. Almost everyone I have spoken with has had a sore arm--like someone had punched them. Some have complained about headaches, fatigue, and other not-so-bad symptoms. I did not get much of a sore arm or other side effects, which is not all that much of a surprise, as I expected that those side effects are part of the antibody response. Just curious... What was your experience? Did those of you who also have very low IGG, IGA, and IGM levels get a sore arm or get other side effects that cannot be attributed to your CVID? \n\nThank goodness for the T-cell response!", "New to CVID Hello all. My brother (36) was just diagnosed 2 days ago. He is been ill since the day he was born and has had many illnesses (some life threatening) throughout his life. The CVID diagnoses finally explains most of it. I guess since I\nplan on being an advocate and caregiver, I was hoping for some advice. I am trying to talk him in getting a second opinion with a specialist. Again, any advice is welcome! Hi! Sorry to hear about all the illnesses. Hopefully this will be the first step to recovery!\nIf I may, I recommend joining the CVID group on Facebook. It is a lot more active and there are a lot more stories and comments to potentially relate to.\nHere is the link: \nGood luck! If he has indeed got CVID then hopefully he will get the required treatment which can improve his quality of life massively.\n\nSince I started on IVIG (I now do subcutaneous infusions at home) approximately 4 years ago I have had only a couple of illnesses and they have only lasted a few days.\n\nI have had other issues but that is down to other conditions that I have. \n\nIf you do not mind me asking which country do you live in? The US I am in the UK.\n\nUnfortunately this sub is very quite, I would recommend you follow the FB link the other person posted. I looked into one, but in order to get into it my brother has to join too. Yeah, I am not on Facebook so here will have to do Ig replacement is wonderful and brought me back to life.  I do it at home once a week and it takes about an hour to infuse.  Here is hoping to him having good insurance as I pay 45 a treatment, some of that is covered by the manufacturer of the drug, and it costs 2k a treatment, every week, for the rest of my life. I am truly sorry that you are going through this. We do not have the home infusion option here. He is going to have to go to the hospital once a month for a 3 hour infusion. We are still waiting to hear back on insurance coverage. Hi! Just stumbled onto your post. I think it is great you want to be an advocate and help out.\n\nI (F34) was diagnosed in 2004 at age 19 and have been doing infusions for 15 years. The last 10-12 years have been at home. \n\nOrganization tips: Early on I would make a physical record keeping folder you both understand that can be taken to appointments and infusions. It might be helpful to have a list of current medications (including new IVIG therapy), formal diagnoses of other conditions, drug allergies, and hospitalizations if they apply. \n\nIt is also helpful to have an infusion journal. If you are going to a cancer center the nurses might have resources for you, it just depends on the hospital or company. When you transition to at home care, it is important to keep labels from bottles, but that is not super important at this stage. \n\nOnce you are into a routine with infusions\u2014it took me 4-5 months, switch record keeping stuff to an electronic source. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them. Send me a PM. Linked a resource you might have already found. Best of luck!\n\n(", "New here. I am at a loss.. Hello, I am 38 and have been going untreated for about the last decade. Is there anything out there anyone has tried like a crispr? Hey Mate, where are you located? I am 33 &amp; in Melbourne, Australia. I have been on Intragam (IVIG) for 3 years and I can tell you that it has changed my life. Ig has saved my life.  Get on it if you can.  Crispr is not used in the mainstream and not for CVID yet. I used to do igg treatments myself every month, but cost and frustration and me stop. I was still getting sick in the third to fourth week. And kind of did not see the point. When I do get sick, I get pretty sick. Usually sinus or respitory infections. My nose has been running since I was born I feel and I have just kind of been dealing with it. I recently read that the life expectancy for cvid is 50 to 63 and that has me pretty discouraged. I got diagnosed last year, and am just a bit younger than you. Apparently I have had it all my life, though it only really started to get to me when I had a child and they started bringing all of the bugs home for me...\nI am on Cuvitru weekly, but I do the treatments at home and it is not a massive hassle. Takes about 20-30m. The upside is that with weekly treatments you never have that 3rd week issue, you are always stable. \nGive it a to if you can find a way to!\nDoctors here in the UK are also critical of that life expectancy study, as it seems to be a pointless one. CVID covers about 300 variants of the condition, and it can be found on people of all ages, with all sorts of additional conditions ( I myself have developed bronchiectasis for not realising I had CVID earlier). Therefore measuring an average from such random data does seem pointless.\nI have got to admit, sometimes I google CVID and that stupid expectancy thing appears with 50 as a number, and it gets to me despite having discussed it with my doctors. I think it would get to anyone! Particularly now I have got a family.\nMy immunology specialist says if i stay on top of it and continue my treatment, there is no reason why I should not live a healthy, full life.\nwish you all the best of luck, but do stay positive! I am over 50, diagnosed with CVID 10 years ago. With immunoglobulin treatment I have seen my infection rate drop dramatically. It took a year of treatment before I stopped feeling sick in the week before the next infusion, but it did get better. I found the switch from monthly IVIG in a medical center, to weekly subcutaneous infusions at home made a big difference in how healthy I felt, and the weekly home treatments was less disruptive to my schedule.\n\nI plan on living far beyond 63. Life expectancy with treatment is almost the same as everyone else. I was diagnosed 7 years ago and have been having immogoblin therapy for the last 3 or 4 years.\n\nThe first couple of years it was via IV which involved a trip to hostipal every 4 weeks. It work well and reduced the amount of infections.\n\nAbout two years ago I switch to subcutaneous immogoblin therapy and the change has been nothing short of amazing.\n\nI have 3 treatments per week, takes no more then 20 mins from start to finish and since I have started Ive had zero infections.\n\nI am in the UK so there is no cost involved for me. Every 3 months I get my medical supplies delivered to me, including my subgam which I store in a fridge that was supplied to me.\n\nI would always say to people that if subcutaneous infusions is an option please consider it", "People who pretend they take the pandemic seriously How do you deal with people in your life who tell you to your face that they are taking the pandemic seriously and wearing their mask, but are unvaxxed and going out to bars and restaurants? I feel lied to and betrayed, and even though I did not say anything about it, I am being sent messages about \"not respecting their decisions!\" And \"of course I wear my mask at the bar!\" If this person is important to you it is probably best to not assume they have lied and instead move forward with the perspective that you have honest yet different definitions of what it means to take COVID seriously. I have found that you have to meet people where they are, not where you are or where you wish them to be. In other words, be a shepherd rather than a prosecutor. Otherwise the conversation devolves into hurt feelings and accusations which is not where you want to be if the person is important to you. For me, you can respect that people can make their own decisions, but not what decisions they make. I would have more respect for the person if they were straight up about not wanting the vaccine or not wanting to adhere to safety guidelines (though in recent weeks those have been stepped down significantly in many cities and states in the US). Respect there would not equate to continued acquaintance or friendship necessarily though, just acknowledging they are not a hypocrite or liar.\n\nI myself have friends and relatives with compromised immune systems, and myself have respiratory issues (I do not have CVID myself, but know those that do), so I did the thing, and stay home as much as possible since I can work from home. Unfortunately I know that they lied to me about going out and wearing a mask, but I did not say a thing about it, I was going to pretend it did not happen, but they know that another friend saw them and told me, so they started sending me texts messages telling me I should respect their decisions and insisting they are being safe, all unprompted and I just responded with \"I just care about taking the pandemic seriously because of people like my mom. I am your friend and I love you and I am here for you if you need me\". Which was met with silence. \n\nThank you for the responses. reddit is making me feel less alone and it helps alot, thank you Same. I do not have CVID but my mom died of it and I know others who have it. My brother is at risk, my MIL is at risk, and its hard feeling like other people do not care And thank you. I really appreciate this That is unfortunate. Sorry to hear that they did lie to you. Sounds like you handled it well which is all you can do \u2014 control what you can control and accept and let go of the rest. Hopefully they are just being defensive because they knew they screwed up and will eventually come back to you. I think that is what happened and so does my partner. It is just been really hard, I am extremely sensitive about it because I lost my mom to cvid and to me, everyone not taking it seriously is putting someones mom like mine at risk. After being diagnosed with CVID for almost 9 years, I have realized that no one is going to care as much about my health as I do. That has become crystal clear since the start of the pandemic. I focus on keeping myself safe how I need to, with very few exceptions. I do have exceptions, otherwise I would never get to see anyone, LOL. I have gotten used to people violating my boundaries so I do tend to over-communicate them to people in my life, unless they have already proven themselves to be respectful and trustworthy. Sometimes, even then, I will still be very clear about what I need to feel safe. \n\nI agree with another commenter. I think your friend knew they messed up but did not want to admit to themselves what the lie and boundary violation says or means about them, so acted defensively. I hope they do come around, apologize, and respect your boundaries in the future. Thank you, I honestly think if not for this sub, I would be bawling my eyes out non stop in loneliness right now. \n\nI want you to know, my partner and I care about people like you and have done everything we can to keep our families and our employees safe, we still require masks in our store (currently giving out like 100 a week bc no one else requires them), we still wear our masks everywhere we go, and we tell people about how immunocompromised people still may not be protected by getting the vaccine and it has convinced some people to wear their mask too. Thank you! Your kindness and thoughtfulness is deeply appreciated. I feel the pandemic has shown how much empathy is missing from the world and it is really sad.

I am recently diagnosed. I am in the process of completing the vaccine challenge. My doctor called me a couple of weeks ago and told me that there were some great pilot program where Hyqvia offered free infusion therapy for the first several weeks and training, and then assuming my insurance covered it, I would take it over. I kind of came out of the blue. I did not realize that I was definitely a candidate for infusion therapy. I have been sick all of my life, but never serious infections, hospitalizations, or serious antibiotic resistance. I have managed to live a relatively active, normal life. She is really pushing it, though. I have gotten a couple of calls from the pharmacy and I told them I wanted to take it a little slow, at least until I finish the vaccine challenge. After such a phone call this morning, my doctor called me and sounded annoyed, then agreed to talk about it at my next appointment, which originally was scheduled for the same day I am to have my labs. When I mentioned this she agreed to push out the appointment a week. I just do not have a great feeling about this. I feel pressured and I am not even sure if I need this stuff. I wonder if I should get a second opinion? Why does she seem so personally invested in this? Hmm yeah that is definitely weird that your doctor is pushing it so hard especially since you do not seem comfortable with it right now. And may not even need it. Are you able to get a secondary opinion? In my experience the only reason my doctor pushed hyqvia really heavily was because I wanted a port and they did not want me to do that even with all of the scar tissues and everything. But so far it is been going well so if you think you do need infusion therapy down the road currently I would recommend hyqvia but only if you are comfortable and it is something that you need or think that you need in order to live a better life. If you have any questions about anything, feel free to PM me I know this stuff can get very overwhelming very quickly. Thank you! I will take you up on that later today Of course! And I am available at pretty much anytime. In my experience, if Docs push things onto patients, it is either very recommended and they wholeheartedly believe it will help, OR they are receiving monetary incentive for this through the pharmaceutical companies. Many get a percentage. Go with your gut. Do not let someone bully you. Doctors are there to HELP. Not to sound annoyed or pushy. Thank you!

Is there a way to soften them? Also, have you ever felt a burning sensation at a site from sunlight? I have never had pain from sunlight. The bumps are most likely lipohypertrophy. Avoiding those areas can help from them developing as well as rotating sites often. After a few years I have had some larger lumps form. They are not rock hard but feel like a more dense accumulation of fat tissue. They stick out more than the rest of my stomach which sucks but have not gone away on their own. I have read liposuction would help, but it is not worthwhile for me. It definitely looks/sounds like lipohypertrophy. I am skinny and lack a lot of surface area for rotation. It is not too bad yet, but I have noticed the build up. I feel you I cannot utilize all the available sites. When I did my love handle area on my back I got stretch marks and my legs get angry too. Just try to feel before each infusion and try to avoid the harder areas. It sucks have a lumpy stomach and arms My legs are sensitive and blow up the most.

I also get the lumps. I have found that doing more needles (went from 2 sites up to 6) results in much smaller lumps and irritation even though it is over more sites. I also ice while infusing which helps and then heat pack after to diffuse it. Completely possible it is just me to but feels like it helps. I also wear tight leggings after infusion for compression. I think my original nurse told me to not expose area to sun so have not done that. Usually infuse inner thighs so not much of a problem.

Have you considered taking FMLA through work? It is federal and they cannot fire you for medical leave.  You can use all your sick and vacation, or none, or work when you can. Of course you have to have the $$ saved to be able to do so.\n\nIt probably will have at least the effect of your second. If you make more antibodies, than maybe worse.\n\nMaybe get the spike protein test for antibodies done from LabCorp and see what your levels are.\n\nIt is a tough choice... That is too bad!  I did read that people on IgG therapy fare better regardless of antibodies and that Tcells have a lot to do with the fight.\n\nMy immunologic came back with another 'It is not Dukes policy at this time...\" You are welcome. Good luck!! Is there a LabCorp url to schedule the spike protein test?  I am in the middle of nowhere. You can go to labcorps site and look for the closest one. \n\nIm pretty sure that Quest diagnostics does it &amp; US Biotek too?.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of small places will send their labs out, so call around to blood draw labs, or even as your drs office if they 'send out' to any if those places.\n\n\nThis is a home finger stick you can order. I would call and ask if the darkness of the positive line is indicative of your antibody response.\nTBH, you want the blood draw as it will give you definitive levels. I have some finger sticks that were used in a clinical trial and it is like a pregnancy tests. Mine showed an antibody response, but the control.line was bright red and my results line was washed out.  I have no idea if it correlates as I could not contact the company.\nQuest ant labcorp are free, and hm POSITIVE that someone in your town has an account with one if them fit bloodwork.\n\nThey receive stuff from outside labs and Dr offices regularly\n\nAt home test\n   ", "Covid antibodies Well, I took an antibody test yesterday after two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and it came back negative. I am disappointed, but I am reminded of a few things: \n\n1) this test only measures IgG. It does not measure T-cell generated immunity\n\n2) I am on Infectra (an immunosuppressant). I know most with CVID are not on this\n\n3) I was informed that this may not have even been the correct lab test to measure immunity generate by the vaccine. There may be a more accurate lab for the spike protein and this was for the nucleocapsid. \n\nI would have liked to see a positive result but some of this science is very new and still evolving. Even if I had come back with positive antibodies I still planned to wear a mask, social distance, and act with all the responsibilities of someone who has not been vaccinated. It was not exactly clear in your post, did you get vaccinated? Yes I have had both doses. I received my second two weeks ago Not OP so maybe this was put in later, but the first sentence in the post says they were vaccinated -\n\n&gt;\tWell, I took an antibody test yesterday after two doses of the Pfizer vaccine That is a bummer! I just did my first dose of Moderna on Wednesday. Fingers-crossed I develop antibodies! In all honesty, this was the expected outcome. As you say, hopefully it will have generated a t-cell response. I presume you have infusions/sub cut and many of these will contain corona virus antibodies (maybe even some Covid ones now too) and this, combined with a strong T cell response, will provide a defence against COVID. I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning.  Thank you for the update! I share your disappointment as well as your optimism. I also must say, it is clear you work in the health care industry, and that you do what you do, with CVID, well, I am inspired. Regarding the additional/alternative testing, do you have plans for that? Yes I am a PA and thank you! As far as additional testing - I am going to look into that. My immunologist works for the same organization that I do (a large one in California) so we have access to the same labs. I am going to look into it this week and see if there are any additional tests we offer. Ahh that stinks but not too surprising.  Thanks for keeping us updated throughout much appreciated. FWIW I did a bit of research and found that there are some t-cell/covid-19 tests under development, but their purpose is to discern whether a person has had covid-19 before (and presumably did not know due to being asymptomatic or to not having been tested). This is not to say that they might not also be used for measuring vaccine efficacy, but since this is not what they are being designed for, they are not making any claims about any of that. Thank you. I did find out that Roche offers a test to the spike protein but I do not know how a person could go about ordering it does themselves.", "I infuse Gammagard SCIG daily. AMA I am up to 630 straight infusions.  Nice.  Got me beat.  I am a once a week guy.  Impressive dedication.  Even my weekly routine wears me down. Why daily? Daily? But, why? Like, I am in charge of my own infusions at 28 grams a month and do it bi-weekly, mostly as to not waste supplies. I dont understand unless you do a small sub-q push? Small doses each day 2grams. This helps my IGG level stay steady. Less use of Prednisone. 2 grams daily helps me keep my IGG level steady. Less use of Prednisone. Gracias.  It wears me down also. Weekly helps it to be steady also. Did you try food restrictions to get the inflammation down? For me a keto lifestyle helps tremendously. Less inflammation = less use of medication. Yes thank you Is your instance covering this? The cost is wild? Yes If I take smaller doses each day, my IGG level stays up and consistent. It has helped me cut back on getting pneumonia, SEPSIS,  and the use of oral steroids.", "Has anyone had/seen anything like this with normal immunoglobulins?

I have been there for years at a time, and it is so frustrating and depressing. Hang on, answers will come eventually! \n\nAs for this specific lab report\u2026This is so far beyond the complexity of the tests my hematologist runs, I do not even know what CD counts are. And she has never run a T cell test (CD3 I guess?). Can anyone elaborate on what all these are and why they are important? Thanks CVID fam! You have been housebound sick for months before too? \nThank you for answering. Yeah I have been through some stuff, like you and many others here. Housebound sick aside from absolutely necessary grocery trips, Dr. appts and Rx runs for over a year in a row once before, again for at least 3 months another time, weeks in a row at least a couple other times, hospitalized and near death from an infection for a couple weeks once, and sick enough that it impeded me from functioning normally and holding down a job consistently for a couple decades in a row\u2014unable to get answers until my eventual CVID dx. Not to mention being mostly housebound during the pandemic, stuck in the house recovering after multiple surgeries, and usually out of commission for 3 days after each IVIG infusion. Sounds like what you are going through right now is pretty bad, so I just wanted you to know there is someone who can truly relate and empathize. It is hard! I hope you get answers from your labs or something else soon. Keep fighting, analyzing stuff like these labs, and advocating for yourself. It pays off. Thank you for your comment and kindness.

Welcome to big brother controlling every thing you do. Why people keep voting for bigger government it is beyond me. TBH the flip side of your POV is that if our government, including President, had done better at dealing with getting testing for our citizens, mandatory Mask requirement and/or an ACTUAL temporary nationwide movement restriction back in March this whole COVID thing would have probably died off by now and we could be going back to normal right now.\n\nAs it is, because no one took the bull by the horns, infection and death rates are 4x what they were in April.\n\nPretty much none of the big foreign countries are accepting US citizens as travelers-including Canada. they are all laughing at us like we are idiots because our numbers are so high and there does not seem to be a change in how our government is trying to contain/control anything to make it better. Mandatory face mask are unconstitutional and tyrannical, which is exactly my point. The government is NOT in any way shape or form responsible for responding to Covid.

Apples and oranges. And if you think dipshit Bernie, Obama, or Biden could have had things \"back to normal\" you are delusional.

Wow, was that class hard at local community college haha", "How hard is it to get IVIG outside of the US? My husband and I have a dream of moving abroad at some point. Are there any US expats that have successfully obtained IVIG treatment?", "My parents do not believe my CVID symptoms are real Four to five days before each infusion I end up feeling lightheaded, foggy, unable to think clearly, incredibly fatigued, physically tired and sore. **I feel like this most days anyway (which is really important to understand)**, but it ramps up incredibly high before my infusion therapy. My dad ended up telling me today that he thinks it is all psychological. His argument was \"chemotherapy patients end up throwing up one to two days before chemo because they are anticipating it to be a miserable experience\". All of my symptoms must be psychological and due to my anticipation of my infusion day. I do not even know what to say. I knew my parents did not necessarily believe my symptoms were as bad as I keep saying they are, but I did not realize they thought I was just making them up in my head. \n\nI have tried diet and exercise, Vitamin D3, niacin, iron, multivitamins, supplements, but nothing helps with the fatigue and brain fog and sore body. Nothing. I am not making any of this up, yet continuously have to justify my existence to my family. It is bad enough having an immune disorder that is essentially invisible to others, but it is even worse thinking that people actually believe I am faking my symptoms.\n\nI feel like stopping my immune therapy altogether at this point and just giving in to death. What is the point in fixing a disorder that has no symptoms? What could possibly go wrong?? Obviously the subcutaneous IG therapy fixes EVERYTHING, so I should not be feeling bad or sick at all ever. It just blows my mind. That is terrible, sorry.  Sounds like you are doing IV, have you thought about SC? I have chronic pain and CVID.  Love all those invisible disorders. I actually am doing subcutaneous and have been for about a year and a half! I am sorry your family is making you feel this way! I understand the feeling exhausted before infusion day thing all too well, mine usually comes with aches and feeling downright crummy too. Pregnancy ramped it into overdrive for me unfortunately and my fianc\u00e9 did not believe how much it took for me to function normally before infusions until then. So, take comfort in it is not just you and do not let your family get to you, CVID is unfortunately something they will never understand fully. Mine still does not and I have been diagnosed for almost 10 years. Do not stop your SCIG treatment.  How often do you take HyQvia?  Have you asked the physician who treats you about using Hizentra could be a different formulation would help.  I do Hizentra weekly with 20g per week.  Having said all of that, fatigue is not uncommon.  Rest when you need it. How often do you infuse? Every 4 weeks. My levels are around 1000 to 1100 by the end of my 4 weeks. I tried Hizentra weekly and had a nurse but even with rotating sites my body was not healing fast enough and I was having difficulty finding places without scar tissue or thick bumps of swollen tissue. Not only that but the Hizentra gave me horrible IBS symptoms to the point where I stopped eating for awhile. Hmm I have only been hizentra and cuvitru so I am not familiar with the scheduling options available to you. Could you reduce your dose and do infusions every 2 weeks? \n\nI have dealt with autoimmune related fatigue since my teens and while it has not gotten better, I have learned to manage better. I try to give myself a task or two for each day and be kind with myself that I cannot do it all. It helps keep me from overexerting myself and then ultimately crashing. I do not know your situation with your parents, would they listen if you expressed how they are reaction has made you feel? If not I would suggest trying to find someone to talk to about the feelings you are experiencing. Chronic illness can feel like it takes a lot from you and without a strong support system at home it can be much more difficult. \n\nLast bit, have you seen other specialist aside from an immunologist to look at other possible causes for your symptoms? With CVID we are more predisposed to other immune disorders that may be impacting how you feel. I infuse every 4 weeks. I tried Hizentra for several months but almost immediately upon starting it has horrible IBS symptoms to the point where I stopped eating for awhile. For some reason my body could not handle it and now that I am on HyQvia I do not have the same issue. Ahh.  Intriguing.  I did not know HyQvia let you go 3 to 4 weeks between infusions.  I suspect that with HyQvia you get the same low trough just prior to your next infusion as you would with an IGIV infusion which is what causes your fatigue and even potential infection.  If you are getting sick you might see if your immunologist can increase your dose.  It used to be dose was weight based but increasingly people think it should be health based.  You will still have a trough but maybe the trough will not be as fatiguing or make you as prone to infections.", "Covid-19 Antibodies in IVIG I receive monthly infusions of Gammagard for my CVID and was wondering if anyone has heard from their doctor if/when we can expect to be getting COVID-19 antibodies from IVIG.\n\nI asked my immunologist back in January and he said that the plasma used to make Gammagard is sourced between 10 to 12 months before it gets to patients, but he did not seem to have a sense of when those of us with CVID might get COVID-19 antibodies through our infusions.\n\nAny info would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! My doctor estimates 1-2 years from now, but says that is basically just conjecture (and not a very specific one at that). I do not think anyone has a really solid idea, which is frustrating! My doctor said anywhere from 8 months to a couple of years, but that he is not sure how we will be able tell. He also said that it would fluctuate widely initially--until more people in the general population have antibodies--so protection from IVIG would be unpredictable and unreliable with the batches the make early in the pandemic. I also heard it will likely be one to two years out. I have been working remotely and am hesitant to return in person until I have antibodies via SubQIG. Anyone else facing the same situation? We may have to return in early Fall I have been back to work for quite awhile, but nobody is allowed in my office, I attend meetings via zoom, and I rarely leave my office. It has worked, but has been a tad bit underwhelming running a department through technology. My department is also very supportive of my immune deficiency, so that helps. I asked my Immunologist about this a few weeks backs and she told me that it will be at least a year before we see them and even then the amount of antibodies will be so few it would make no difference.\n\nShe did go a little in depth why this was but I have got to be honest it went right over my head lol but the gist is do not plan on it helping because it will not. \n\nI am due to actually see her next month and I plan on asking again and this time I will remember to take notes lol.  I am not aware of Federal laws that prevent plasma collection in large cities.  In the Houston, Tx area there are at least 20 Plasma donation centers (this is the 4th largest city in the U.S.) with over 6 million people.  We had plentiful COVID cases.  I searched on locations in Los Angeles and see many.  I see several in and around Manhattan.  Anyway, if you have CVID please volunteer with the Immune Deficiency Foundation.  Every April, the plasma donation centers are looking for immune deficient patients to come to their facilities to meet with their staff and donors.  I have done many of these trips in SE Texas and it is a great experience.  It is a great chance to understand the process.  It also is a chance to help the staff and patients understand that they are literally saving lives when they donate plasma. That sounds tough. Did they consider letting you just work from home considering you are already separated? We also have open seating at our office with no private offices so that would be tough to do for me. I could have requested a special accommodation, but if all my employees had to go back, I felt that I should be there with them. I probably would not have done it if I did not have my own office, and the approval of HR to prohibit anyone from entering it (I have a sign on my door). My doctor said that it was not the most ideal arrangement, but that I should be fine. In the few times I need to leave my office, I never touch anything outside of my office without washing my hands prior to returning to my office, and I, of course, wear a mask outside my office. It is also helpful that we have less than 10 people on my floor. Like I said, not ideal, but it has worked out so far. Sorry to hear that you do not have the same opportunity with no office. I hope that you are able to find a way that you can continue to work and still feel relatively safe. Best wishes to you! This ( from April 2020 discusses that antibodies for COVID-19 were already present in tested samples of Gamunex-C and Flebogamma at the time. I infuse Gammagard daily. I have not heard anything either. Well my mother had COVID in January. I took care of her without PPE, not knowing she had COVID at that time. \nI tested negative.\nI also infuse everyday. I believe I may have the antibodies from my Gammagard. \nI take many vitamins and supplements daily.\nI am also fully vaccinated.\nHope this helps.", "Bad effects after Vaccine (Prevnar 13) I had a shot of this stuff on Friday, its early Sunday where I am. I have woken up with chills, fever and body pain today. Could be that my weak immune system is just preparing for some serious fighting against the fake, harmless enemy. Also got a sore throat last night but that could be unrelated, idk. \n\nWhat are your experiences with vaccinations ?

At least I know what to expect.", "CVID and new COVID MRNA vaccine question Anyone have any information on whether immunodeficient people should even be considering receiving this vaccine?? My immunologist is not giving me any advice whether I should or should not due to there not being enough information available currently on the vaccine.  All of the information I could find on the internet says that the vaccine has not been tested on immunodeficient people.  Anyone have any news about this from their immunologist or doctors?  Thanks!  My immunologist and oncologist told me not to take it. I am in the same boat. If you are on immunosuppressives, then you are not going to react to it so it is pointless. I also had GB, so right there, not a good idea. Mine told me to get it. Noted the t-cell response. The Immune Deficiency Foundation put out a video a couple of weeks ago about the COVID vaccine and their recommendation for immune deficient patients. They are saying that the vaccine provides T-cell immunity even in people who do not produce an antibody response. Talk to your doctor, I have an appointment with my immunologist in January, I am hoping to get the green light for the vaccine. \n\n Thank you. By B-cells are no good, but my T-cells are for the most part normal. This is reassuring. I get the flu shot ever year to humor my doctor, thinking that I was not producing any response to it since my antibody production is almost zero. It is only this year that I finally learned something about T-cell immunity and that all of those flu shots I put up with may actually be helping me. The immune system is insanely complicated. My immunologist told me to get it. I think it is a case-by-case basis. I would consult with your immunologist first, like everyone else said. When I started to try to learn something about immunology I quickly learned that it was where I would have flunked out of medical school, had I been crazy enough to attempt it. I am a HCW and hopefully getting it very soon. I will post an update when I receive it. My doctor said yes. My second dose is soon. So far a little bit of side effects but so far so good. My doctor said yes. My second dose is soon. So far a little bit of side effects but so far so good.", "Covid Reassurance Hello CVID pals! I have CVID and have been at points very dangerously and hospitalized. However, just felt a little off a week ago and got Covid tested just in case, and it came back positive, I know it is been over a week since I have had symptoms, but I am still scared that something is going to happen. I do not have a fever, trouble breathing, nothing, just a little stuffiness. Thought I had a sinus infection maybe since I am prone to those. Has anyone had a similar experience? Did it get worse? I am just hoping it was a false positive or that miraculously my body did not decide to fall apart and land me in the hospital this time. No experience with covid but I have CVID.  I think that we tend to see the immune system we do not have and do not appreciate the one we have. Congratulations on the great response and it provides me hope I would react the same. Thanks, I have been absolutely in tears worried that things will get worse, and had forgotten that yes, on some level I do have an immune system that functions, and maybe I just got very very lucky. Remember to just breathe. I have CVID too! I believe I had Covid when it first hit the states. I was fatigued for a month, had what felt like a bad sinus infection, and had bad headaches at the top of the back of my neck/bottom of the back of my head. Shortness of breath was minimal, thank God. I thought it was a bad upper respiratory virus that knocked me down. \n\nI did not get tested, as this was before the covid testing. Still unsure if that is what it was. But it seems like it was, as many symptoms in the location I was at were the same as mine (I work in healthcare). But back to my original point: breathe. Try not to get really worked up--- when we stress out, our immune systems freak out on us. Stay calm; I know this is VERY hard to do. \n\nI have seen a couple reports that talk about how folks with primary immune deficiencies fair *well* with covid just because our immune systems do not have the exaggerated response that others do. We may not get the entire cytokine storm that *healthy* immune systems throw down at Covid. Our immune systems kind of go, \"Wait what is happening? Oh.\" and we can ride it out like a cold. So the odds may yet be in your favor! Prayers for you friend!\n\nSide note: there is always new information coming out on this subject. If anyone is following CVID and Covid-19 please feel free to share some info! I think this is the most what I needed to hear right now. I am going to meditate now, try to rest, then call my Dr first thing in the morning Perfect! If your immunities go low, I would venture they may infuse you with IVIG if needed to get you over the hump if you start getting super symptomatic. Right now they may *watch and wait*, or draw some labs to look at your immune panel based on your health history. Keep us updated! Again, prayers friend! I am absolutely asymptomatic, but I will keep that jn mind. I always get unpleasant side effects with IVIG, so fingers crossed it is not needed! I have a feeling it will be a watch and wait situation. Honestly being told to calm down bc I get sick when I am stressed was the best reminder/advice I needed right now lol. Got To remember that stressed=sick, so now is the time to stay zen and try to r e m a i n asymptomatic. Good deal! I am hoping you will not need the IVIG this time. Sending all the good zen vibes your way. :) I have been reading the exact same thing from what little data I can scrape up from around the world.  As you have described, our defect offers protection.  Anecdotally, I have also been finding very low IgA folks are taking far longer to clear it.\n\nI was told most tests will not work for me and I would love to be checked before I have to return to work.  What test can we get for COVID? Quite interesting!! Thank you for sharing that information. That is very good to know.\n\nAs far as I know, (and I could be wrong, feel free to offer data if so), the Covid testing via nasal cavity swab will show if Covid-19 is present, but only if the viral load is high enough for the test to detect it. Some of us *know* we are sick by what our bodies tell us (with having CVID) long before tests can give us a positive answer.\n\nAlso, I spoke to my Immunologist about the vaccine. She said I would be clear to get it as long as my IgA, IgG, IgE, IgM levels were within normal limits, yet that she would need to monitor my antibodies reaction via labwork to see if I created immunity. I am sure this involves much labwork.\n\nAll in all, I would say the best thing to do is speak to your Primary Care Provider and/or Immunologist about your concerns. That is the perfect place to get questions answered. They must be very deep in research studies at the moment, and reassuring many patients with low immune systems of what we all need to do at this time. I hope I could help answer your question! :) Now I have covid.  My symptoms are mild too.  I am going to hope for the best.  Your story is going to make me feel better. I am like 10 days in and have some gnarly fatigue, a couple of headaches, achiness and a little nausea, but otherwise doing well! Honestly I experience worse when I get stress-sick or catch other things. Hope you can get through with equally or more manageable symptoms!\n\nEdit: I have no concept of time bc I never leave my house, but I have been marking things in my planner, and I am 12 days in after initially feeling off. 7 days since getting tested. I can happily keep you updated if you want to know if anything lingers/ if my doctors say anything. So far I have checked in and they were basically pleased that I am doing alright, I was given antibiotics for a small additional infection ok too of Covid, but otherwise have not needed anything other than Tylenol and mucinex. Drinking  a LOT of water. Those have been my symptoms but mostly mild. Felt better after my infusion yesterday.  I am also taking a ton of different supplements targeted for the immune system.  I have alway been a supplement guy.  I have no idea if they actually help but I am not stopping now. I have CVID too, got diagnosed beginning of 2020.  I have been in korea for the past year and isolating so covid hasnt really been an issue but im moving back to the states in 3 weeks, kind of worried, I havd low levels in all immunoglobulin types and i dont do therapy cause i feel like it does more harm then good in my case.  I guess what im tryna say is hang in there you arent alone. Ahhh thanks, I always suffer a lot from the IVIG treatments too, even if they help a lot in the long term. I am doing better, I hope you can stay safe!!!! Update: I am doing better, still low energy but what is new! Otherwise okay, just continuing to quarantine. I hope you are feeling alright and can heal!!!!", "Second covid-19 vaccine in yesterday! 24+ hours later with no side effects other than mildly sore arm.  Yay! How exciting! I am getting my first dose on the 20th and I am so ready. Awesome! I am hoping to get mine soon. Its so interesting that three doctors, immunologist, pulmonologist, oncologist told me with CVID to not get this vaccine. I know there are varying ranges of CVID, but I wonder why such a differing opinion amongst doctors. That is a bit odd. Mine did not hesitate, telling me to get mine at my very earliest availability. I suspect that some doctors are aware of the t-cell response and others are not.\n\nAnyone hear if they are going to prioritize vaccinating younger people with severely compromised immune systems (or other conditions that make one more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms)? My state is doing all essential workers next, which includes people in customer service roles. Seems like it may be a while. Yea I agree its odd and its concerning with the varying views in the medical community. Who do we believe? I guess at the end of the day its up to us to make that decision. I have not heard of prioritization yet but am watching. I think for now I will just stick with my monthly infusions :) At some point, we will start seeing COVID-19 antibodies in the immunoglobulin many of us receive. However, it may be hard to know when that will happen, given the amount of time it takes to produce it and varying inventory patterns. Speaking for California - ages 16-49 with underlying health conditions are in tier 1C. It is interesting that there is not quite a consensus amongst the medical community yet. I am happy to be a guinea pig, however. As a medical professional myself there did not seem to be a downside/danger personally since it is not a live vaccine. Ahhhh this gives me hope!!!! Yay! How long before you learn whether you have been able to respond positively? About a month or so? I am going to have antibodies checked in two weeks. And if it is negative maybe at 4. Thank you for keeping this subreddit updated you are the best. Thanks! I am happy to report back! Either way, please let us know how it goes Will do! My wife, who has cvid gets her second Pfizer dose tomorrow. Glad it went smooth for you!", "CVID as a student Hi everyone,\n\nI was diagnosed with CVID about 4 years ago but did not have to advocate for my own health too much at the time since I was in high school. Now, I am in college and across the country from my family and regular doctors. Even though I have some support systems here, there is a lot more to focus on/worry about. \n\nAny tips on this transition or balancing school/work with SC infusions? I am also a bit worried about an increased risk of getting sick now that I live in a dorm. Any advice on how to be a college student and become a \"real adult\" while also dealing with CVID would be greatly appreciated! It can be difficult and it sounds like you are at least a little prepared for that. I recommend, depending on which vax you respond to, staying on top of those for sure. Hand sanitizer all of the times. The goofy masks if you can bear it when necessary. Making sure I make time to sleep regardless  seems to help keep my immune system in balance. I have autoimmune shit too and it sorta keeps all that in check too. \n\nJust sorta preemptively protecting yourself, ya know? \n\nOn a similar note maybe ask your doctor about \nprobiotics or whatever too. For some reason I get Shingles all the time so I take Valacyclovir ever day. It is always somewhere between 2 and 6 weeks almost as soon as I stop. I get weird infections so it is a bit tricky, like the PCP pneumonia and shit. It sucks. \n\nIt is also super important to communicate with your professors and admin for that matter. Let them know. By the time I knew what the heck was wrong with me I had to repeat Microbiology twice. Both times approx 5 weeks in, which was when we did the identifying live bacteria and viruses or whatever, I was suddenly out of commission  for a couple weeks. Now that we know and it totally makes sense and they just altered the lab a bit. \n\nI also have a sorta script stating I do in fact have CVID and Dermatomyositis with both my immunologists and  rheumatologists contact info just in case. In the beginning it was bc I was admitted to hospital with a seemingly random wbc of 23 and left shift. My first chest x ray was clean and I guess they just did not read my records bc it took them a couple days to realize (when my usual Drs popped in like wtf??) I would not have the traditional signs and symptoms. My immunoglobulins had tanked then a CT Scan revealed a rare atypical pneumonia, but now I use it as a sorta verification that it is def a thing and dangerous too for both work and school. \n\nIt is also incase I need to see someone that is not used to me. My blood work is a mess and a bit startling anyone unfamiliar with my medical nonsense reacts accordingly. \nI dunno, just remember you know you and your body best so listen to it. if I can think of anything else I will let you know but those were some of the things I struggled with the most. Good luck! I am in a very similar position. I was diagnosed at 14, and my Mom has been an amazing advocate throughout high school. However, now I am 20 and in college across the state. I am also having a difficult journey trying to become a better advocate for myself. \n\nFirstly, get out of the dorms ASAP. I lived in dorms for my first year in college, and I was extremely sick pretty much that whole year. It made it a struggle to go to class because I was so exhausted and I could not stop coughing to save my life. Trust me I tried everything. Dorms are typically very old (at least at my school) and there are so many people living in close proximity to you (especially if you have roommate(s)). \n\nAfter I finally got out of dorms, I made another huge mistake by living in an apartment with 3 other girls. These girls ended up being very unsanitary to put it nicely. I ended up getting very sick again. This year, I finally moved into a place by myself and have not gotten sick all year so far!!! This is super exciting for me. Btw I had not really gotten sick much at all before college. Anyways, living alone gets a little lonely sometimes, but it is so worth it for me.\n\nOn another note, I am still trying to figure out how to counteract my everyday fatigue and just feeling shitty in general (especially before subq is due). It has really taken a toll on my grades and my social life. Sorry for the long post, but I just found this subreddit because I did not even think to check before, and it is quite rare to find other people in this position. I hope your having a good week, try to stay positive. Ik it can be hard sometimes when your genes feel doomed. Thank you for your advice! My school has a policy where everyone has to live on campus, but I just found out how to get approval for a guaranteed single room through the health services folks, so I will hopefully be able to move for next semester. My doctors are just starting to think I might have immunodeficiency. I always had problems with sinuses but living alone in room and had limited contact with other people. When I started sharing the room - disaster. Using public transportation - disaster. Now, I got a single dorm room at my uni, I feel sick but it is not progressing that fast - \"just\" fatigue and feeling sick. But as I said, I am suspected for this, it is not confirmed yet.\nAsk if you can live alone in dorm.", "New Members &amp; Moderators While this is a rare condition and a new community, I think we would get a lot more benefit from having a greater number of members to share experiences with and to offer each other advice. \n\nIt would be really great if there are some people that are willing to assist in growing this subreddit and if there are any people interested in being a moderator, please contact me.", "A glimpse into our world  Funny Thx! Feel free to share My thoughts exactly, it is business as usual for me, been social distancing before it was cool it feels like so many are walking the shoes of someone with cvid", "IVIG Side Effects with CVID I was diagnosed with CVID about 3 months ago after being sick with sinus infections for 6 months. Per my doctors I have had CVID my entire life but with medical changes it is become more prevalent. I started IVIG/Gammaguard 2 months ago. I get IVIG every 4 weeks. However, I have noticed after every treatment I get really emotional and irritable. As far as I know this is not listed as a side effect. Has anyone else experienced this? Have not noticed it. Shooting from the hip, the Ig is giving the body the bullets to fight the bad guys and the mounting of a defense could be wearing you out and making you crabby, but it should even out after a bit.  I had some weird skin stuff at first and it actually helped me sleep, but I do not have any reactions now after 14-16 months That makes sense! I have also noticed that I bleed more easily like my gums and bloody noses right afterwards. Interesting.  I have noted a little malaise for the next day or two, but no blood thinning for bleeding. I do not get irritated and moody after infusions, but I do mine weekly at home subq and I am also on anti-depressants. Talk to the dr. About it for sure! I started on IVIG monthly and I had a really rough time with it. I felt my energy drop lower than I had ever experienced for the last week of the month and I had a 3-day migraine starting a few hours after the infusion. Thankfully I pretty quickly moved to the self-administration with subcutaneous infusions weekly and eventually every 6 days to stabilize my energy and emotional swings and minimize the side-effects. I can still feel when it is the day I need to do my infusion and I would describe it as a low-energy, low-motivation, sort of depression like dip that I get back on the flip side as a burst of energy, motivation and libido that is the high point of my energy curve but not manic as much as restored and healthy. I have been told that the depleted energy is a common complaint but the other ones are roughly unique to me,  but I suspect that it is not reported because of social stigma about sexuality and being in touch with one\u2019s sex drive is discouraged rather than celebrated but I am long past being ashamed of the way that my body works (and does not), much less the good and bad effects of the treatments I require to survive. Being able and wanting to have sex all night weekly is a pretty fun side-effect that I get to share with my partner or enjoy solo. Thank you! Sounds very familiar. I started my monthly treatments back in May. Since then I have noticed that my energy level has dropped so much. I am always sleeping. I had contributed it to my work schedule and change in life but maybe it is the IVIG. I have not had a drop in sex drive. As for being emotional I only am about the first 4ish days after my infusion then I level off. As for migraines I get pre-medications prior to my infusions for help with those so I do not get them. For me it is more of the fatigue and emotional stuff. Thank you! Sounds very familiar. I started my monthly treatments back in May. Since then I have noticed that my energy level has dropped so much.

For me it is more of the fatigue and emotional stuff. If you can switch to the subcutaneous infusions, previously only available to self-administer weekly but recently a 2-week formulation has been released, both are better at maintaining a steady level of IGG throughout the time and do not require going in to get infusions so it is a much better experience all around and I believe that except for cases that they cannot use it long-term treatment strategy is typically to use IV to rapidly get the level to a safe place and monitor the effects and once they are stable transition to home infusions (and if the idea of sticking yourself with a needle is intimidating, do not worry they will send a nurse to teach you and watch you do it for the first few sessions and because you are aiming for the tissue below your skin but above your muscle it is not like trying to get an IV started. It is more akin to pin the tail on the donkey in that you just got to got to aim and push, they train children to do it so I am sure that anybody who has been living with the kind of issues that are as \u201cnormal\u201d as a very rare diagnosis can be can stick their belly. I wish I had a more encouraging resolution to the energy level issue and the truth is that I have been complaining about it from the beginning until now and I have finally been prescribed a drug that I found through my own research, located a legal prodrug of online and tried it and I have to pay for it because it is off-label and it took 3 tries to find a formulation that was less than $800/mo out of pocket. If you want to get on it, you can start trying now and if you are lucky, well-connected in the medical community and you are really insistent that you are not able to maintain a healthy quality of life you might be able to get it in 5-7 years. If you have a diagnosis for ADD/ADHD from childhood and/or genuinely have the condition, you can talk to a psychiatrist or your pcp with the input of your immunologist to be prescribed stimulants which is the most effective thing I have tried but I do not have any attention problem, I just cannot get out of the f\u2019ing bed some days. \n\nIf you want to know, the drug that I currently take to combat fatigue is Provigil. It is not going that great though so I do not know if I would even suggest it but I have some other health issues that are unrelated except that I have to take meds for all of them and each of the individual meds has drowsiness warnings on it, and as someone who has been used to thinking quickly and speaking clearly, the worst is epilepsy meds. I have been on 4 different meds over the past decade and every one of them is so debilitating to my ability to think and speak my thoughts that it is a real issue deciding \u201cwould I rather lose a little bit of my mind all the time or all of it a little bit of time\u201d. At least one caused irreversible brain damage, what a great seizure drug, y\u2019know? I would probably have less seizures if I had no thoughts at all and taking these meds I sometimes feel like that is what they are going for. \n\nAnyway, it is not just you, so to the extent that knowledge is comforting I hope it helps. If you can push yourself to stay in your routines you are more likely to retain the ability to be energetic as much as possible. I did not do that very well. Good luck and let me know if you have any more questions. Unfortunately, I have to be on the infusions due to other medical problems and because my IGG levels were non existent when we first discovered this diagnosis. The injections are too dangerous for me at this time.", "Side Effects and Complications My daughter had her first infusion of IVIG yesterday. It all went well and she finished around 2:30 in the afternoon. She seemed fine but a bit tired in the afternoon and went to bed at her normal time.\n\nShe was up vomiting from 11:45-6:00 am, had chills, fever, shaking, lethargy, and cries in pain anytime she moves. She literally has not left her bed today and has eaten nothing.\n\nI have spoken to her doctor, but I am wondering if anyone here has experienced anything similar and what it was determined to be.", "Port and patients with CVID I am almost 23 years old and was recently diagnosed with CVID. All of my life I have had issues with getting IVs and blood work due to my veins being too small. Each visit to get my IVIG infusions, I am having to get stuck 2-5 times due to my veins being flat, rolling, etc. It is not fun, especially having a severe fear of needles, I have to take Xanax and wear lidocaine cream to prepare myself every visit. I refuse to do SubQ (even though it is less painful) since I just started getting use to the IVs without panicking as much anymore and because I still have to get blood work every three weeks to look at my IGG and iron levels, creating the issue of finding a vein still. \n  My immunologist fears that if I were to receive a port, my body could reject it, saying \u201conly cancer patients receive ports and they either die or get them taken out once they are cured\u201d. My mom, who is an oncology nurse disagreed since not everyone with cancer is cured. My immunologist has threatened to \u201cfire\u201d me as a patient if I were to receive a port and any patient that is new to her, that has a port, she makes them get it removed. My doctor has even written on her notes saying that this is all just \u201cpsychological distress\u201d, without even considering the pain I go through when my vein rejects the IVs. Due to this, I am looking for a new Immunologist who will give me a second opinion and who will have more experience with patients who receive ports. I have done my studying and found an article  where out of all of the patients who received ports with CVID in the study, only one patient had to get it removed after the port being fractured for an unknown reason, after years of having it. \n A weird part of my CVID is that I do not make B cells, which affects my Immunoglobulins G, M, E, A, etc. As my mom pointed out, I still have what I need in my body to fight off some infections, but not all. I have questioned bone marrow/ stem cell transplant but again, my immunologist is scared my body would reject the transplant. I have not had any history of rejects, I have had a heart valve for 10+ years with no issues. Has anyone with CVID had any experiences with ports, or even stem cell transplant/ bone marrow transplants and complications of rejection? The real concern with a port is infection, less so rejection. Ports/ central lines have an infection risk and can lead to sepsis. Blood clots is another concern for ports. \n\nFor routine blood draws in a lab, a port cannot typically be used because the phlebotomists are not trained to do blood draws from a port. \n\nAlso you have to be careful of who accesses or touches your port because there are so many nurses that are lax about sterile technique, and any introduction of bacteria can mean big problems. I have been tested recently to see if I am prone to blood clots, which showed I was not prone to them, but of course that is always a risk. When it comes to my blood work, I only go to my oncologist, when I receive my IVIG and have a specific nurse do it every time (due to my OCD about who and where I get my IV). She has said that if I were to receive a port, she would be the only one to access it (unless she took a day off) and that she would take every precaution to make sure the area is sterile Take the advice above. Ports are very risky especially considering you already have a compromised immune system. Port infections are prone to being fatal. Please listen to your doctor on this one. \n\nI know you mentioned in your post that you are opposed to subQ but it is rather painless in comparison to failed IVs. SubQ have less negative side effects that monthly infusions have. I have been doing subQ for 17 years and would not ever consider going back to IV treatment. I have been at this CVID thing for nearly 15 years and before subq therapy was FDA approved. My veins are very hard to access and at my last IVIG sans port I had 3 different nurses stick me 12 times with no success before the all walked out and demanded I get a port. It was risky but I was out of options. I was able to keep my port infection free and clot free for many years. I was very lucky. Honestly, the CVID experts strongly recommend against ports for us. You will have a hard time finding this option available to you because you have better, less risky options available to you. \n\nEventually, I moved to SUBQ therapy and I wish I had done it sooner. Yes, I have to stick myself but I am in control of my therapy. I do not have to rely on a nurse to show up. Nobody sticks me. It is much better for my mental health. The flexibility of subq infusion is fantastic as I infuse when it is most convenient for me rather than a nurse or infusion clinic. I can infuse at the movie theater, out to dinner, at the soccer fields with my kids, on a long car ride, or at home in my pajamas. \n\nIt is a tough decision. You are very fortunate to have options. Feel free to ask me anything. How long did you have your port for and what did it take for your doctor to allow you to get one? All of the specialists I have researched, only recommend SubQ The reason I was allowed a port was because SUBQ therapy was not available as it was not FDA approved yet. After two years of IVIG not going well, I moved to the first SUBQ drug called Vivaglobin. Did the nurses have issues accessing your port? Once or twice they would miss and have to restick but mostly it was one and done. \n\nOne thing to consider with a port. The needle to access it is quite large. It is an 18 gauge and 1.5 inch or longer depending on what is needed. You definitely feel a needle that big. It is hooked and just plain ugly. Do not think it is easy. It is definitely easier that getting missed 5-6 times my a traditional IV but you are not getting off easy. Also, it must be flushed every 28 days. If ever you go off treatment or miss a dose of your IVIG, the post must be accessed and flushed to avoid clots. \n\nSubq needles by contrast are very small and thin. A typical size is 27 gauge and 10 mm long. I do not even feel them going in and do not use numbing medication. I do not understand why you do not switch to the subq preparation. It might not have been available for you back then but it is widely available and in my experience (I also had a dreadful experience with the IV infusions), that is pretty much the standard recommendation for people who are counter indicated for IV. It is also just a much better experience throughout.", "I have CVID, I have debilitating fatigue and I am also a medical specialist This post is not written from the perspective of a healthcare provider. My field is far removed from immunology (though nothing truly is unaffected by the immune system if you think about it)\n\nAs I write this I feel like I am at my end from fatigue.\n\nI have been on IVIG for 3 years. I have mainly an IgG deficiency and off treatment it was severely low. Even with my levels maintaining fairly normally on 3 weekly IVIG I am severely fatigued.\n\nRecently visited the specialist and ran through the options. Sub cutaneous Immunoglobulin is no widely available, in fact is currently unavailable, where I live. Apparently those on subcut treatment feel a little better.\n\nI feel like I cannot work anymore, cannot tend to family, interests, nothing. I am simply just depleted on most days. I am lucky if I have one good day in two weeks.\n\nNot sure what my aim is here. \n\nTell me there are others like me? I am sorry you are experiencing strong fatigue and SubQ is not available for you. The peaks and troughs are not as bad on SubQ. Before I was on it I had bad troughs and felt like I needed a higher dose because I was exhausted all the time. I do not know what you have looked into but maybe call your insurance company about SubQ. I was only offered SubQ when I changed my immunologist. I have been doing them for almost 7 years at home and I find my overall health is significantly better. \n\nI hope you find something that helps how you are feeling. There is a good CVID Facebook community that has a lot of resources if you have more questions. \u201cImmune Deficiency Support Group\u201d is a good one, as well as \u201cCommon Variable Immunodeficiency (Public Group).\u201d They are both good places to ask questions and get good feedback. Best of luck! You are not alone with the fatigue. I hear you, I have been there, and I go through severe bouts of it myself. It sucks. \n\nI currently do subq but did IVIg for a time. When I did IVIg I was grateful for being able to do it once/week necause I heard about the terrible fatigue with the monthly troughs (for those who do the standard once/month). Maybe increasing the frequency might help? I also have cvid and I had crazy fatigue, almost quit my practice because of it.  It was not until I started injecting testosterone that the fatigue resolved.  I had hypogonadism, so it was not a vanity issue and the topical did nothing, but injecting brought my life back.  Best of luck. I remember before I started treatment I was a lot like this. Even after getting SubQ treatments, the fatigue gets rough. I cannot imagine how bad IV is, but I know it is worse on the down slope. You are not alone. That was the biggest shock to me, cause I actually met someone else that has CVID and for the first time since I was diagnosed, I felt like I was not the only person in the room, if that makes any sense. Not sure where this was going but here we are.", "New here, looking for some support I lost my mom to it, and the pandemic has been really emotionally distressing, bc I realized I see people who do not take the pandemic seriously as people who do not care about the immunocompromised. I know this is my problem, not other people's, and I am in therapy. I was just hoping to find out some ways other people have dealt with the anger/hurt/sadness/fear about people who do not take the pandemic seriously. (I know this makes me a control freak, I just cannot help but have an emotional reaction to it, even now I am trying to hold back tears bc I genuinely do not want to be like this) You are not alone. Many of us wish those around us would understand. And many do. But you are absolutely right that many others do not. \n\nI believe that maturity is not a milestone achieved upon reaching a specific age; rather, it is the cumulative impact of facing, and rising above, challenges. We in the CVID community not only face our own challenges, but we also tend to be around others facing similar challenges. There are many people out there of all ages who have yet to face the life-changing challenges that inspire maturity, and there are still others who choose not to learn from those they do face.\n\nIt is painful to watch the walls close in as life returns to normal around us. Yet, people I work with reach out to me to ask what they should do to keep me safe--in one of the states that has aggressively fought COVID precautions. And work I have done to advocate for people with severely compromised immune systems has been well received. In my view, we surround ourselves with those who care, but this pandemic has taught us that we still have a long way to go to educate our society on what it means to live with a severely compromised immune system. Together, we are strong, and we will get through this. Many blessings for good health and peace of mind as we find our path forward. Oh honey, I am so sorry. I have CVID myself and its just as hard o  the family as it is on the patient. Please remember to breathe, practice self care and know there are people who will help you if you just ask.

I decided to do the Johnson&amp;Johnson because I get really worked up over shots and just wanted to get one and done. Did anyone have a reaction from it or any side affects? \nI am also starting Hysentra by subq injection this week. Im going to get it once a week once I get my virtual nurse. How did you prepare for the vaccine when it came to treatments? I got the AstraZeneca (Canada)vaxx and felt awful the next day. Absolutely trash. I felt better within 36 hrs. I have been holding off my scig bc I am not sure what to do. Left a message with my immunologist. Waiting to hear back. I believe there is a 6 week window in which you are supposed to hold back immunoglobulin but yet to confirm. Good luck with your vaxx! I got the Moderna vaccine, and had my second shot 2 weeks ago. I am also on sub-q hizentra weekly. I lined my treatment schedule up to be taken the day before I got the shot, but I do not imagine taking it a day or two before really matters.\n\nAs for side effects, I felt fine after the first shot, but the second one was awful. I had body aches and a migraine and a fever (well, as much of one we can run anyway). Felt bleh for a couple days after, but I feel 100% now!\n\n(Also, you should probably find a good coping mechanism with the weekly infusions if you have an issue with needles. I find that talking to someone helps, even if it is a rubber duck! Also, do not forget to breathe!) Interesting, I was never told that I had to hold my igg infusions. I got my shots through my immunologists, so I believe they would have said something about that if it were so. Though, I suppose medications and treatments could differ? To my understanding those with CVID should not take the J&amp;J vaccine. I would consult with your immunologist before committing to one of the vaccines. I was also advised not to get the J&amp;J vaccine (or anyone in my family) due to the viral vector.  This seemed to be out of an abundance of caution for those of us with CVID.  I guess the most important thing is to get a vaccine and if this is the only way you will do it, and it is your immunologist suggesting it.  Re timing of vaccine vis-a-vis your Hizentra... I was advised to do Hizentra 4 days after vaccination.  This may have been to isolate which one caused side effects. Just seconding everyone else who said we are not supposed to get the J&amp;J. Two immunologists told me the same thing: Moderna is best and has the most MRNA.", "How are you guys doing with all the Covid Vax side effects? Any measurable b-cell responses? Due to worsening reactions to IVIG we had to nix infusions completely which made the Vaccine a thing I had to do and I am definitely feeling all sorts of awful. I was surprised for some reason, like bc I do t make very many antibodies to alotta stuffs, but here we are. The idea of a second dose is making me a little anxious now too. \n\nI hope you are all fairing well and staying safe \u2764\ufe0f I get mine tomorrow morning. I have seen posts of people mentioning they have had a positive antibody response after the vaccine, which is incredible news for us. Others I have seen post they have not had the same results. So we are definitely all unique. I hope your reaction is indicative of a good response for you! \nHave you tried SCIG instead of IVIG? Far fewer reactions for me with SCIG and I can do it on my terms. I am a few weeks past both shots.  I did not have any side effects worth mentioning.  I did show a borderline reaction to the Pfizer vaccine.  I am glad you have started with the vaccine.  In another thread I mention the lab tests you can do two weeks or more after your second shot to measure immune response.  I hope it works well for you and sorry to hear you are not tolerating the IVIG. Good luck! I asked about SCIG but the VA had enough difficulty facilitating the IVIG which went through Rheumatology bc no Immunology but said they will contact Penn and ask about it while they try to get me where I need to go. The Drs are absolutely wonderful, it is so complicated and there is a lot of unknowns so do not get me wrong, I am grateful beyond words, but it is been such a mess lol. Let me know how you fair! People should still get the vaccine even if they are on gammaglobulin... Yea, we sorta talked about it but the guidelines for the VA we are pretty strict at the time- &gt;75 with exceptions of course, but I think the IVIG made everyone feel a bit more comfortable. There is an abundance of elderly patients and so many exceptions in a place like that as well. \n\nMy Immunologist is outside the VA too,  bc they do not have any, even in PHL, so I think that was a factor. Internal communication can be a bit of a mess at the best of times and I am pretty sure they had to use immunosuppressed, bc autoimmune, instead of deficient, in the end anyhow. It gets wild sometimes.", "New Member. Looking to share info. Hi all,\n\nNew here. I am a 32M and was diagnosed in 2019. Luckily, right before covid.\n\nI am hoping to share some of my experience and observations to look for commonalities with others and figure out this illness a bit more.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS of IVIG\nLike most, I get headaches and fatigue. Hydration is super important but I have also noticed a correlation between the number of \"champagne bubbles\" that get through and the severity of my headaches. Having the product chilled has reduced frothing, thus bubbles, and thus headaches. Anyone else?\n\nCAUSE\nMy doctor suspected my CVID could be genetic as others in my family also have it but the genetic marker for CVID was not found in a genetic test and she believes it is environmentally caused during childhood. What do others know about environmental causes of CVID? To throw another wrench into this, the genetic test showed I am a carrier for CF and I have another gene which can sometimes interact with the CF gene, suggesting the symptoms \"could\" be some weird half active version of CF but my doctor does not think so and thinks I am a slam dunk for CVID. I will do a swear chloride test eventually to rule this out. Anyone else had a genetic test?\n\nSYMPTOMS\nI did not realize my life was unusual lol. I was always sick with mostly sinus infections and fatigue and stomach \"bloat\". IVIG fixed this. I and all those in my family with CVID also have keratosis pilaris on our upper arms and legs. Could be unrelated but who knows. Do others have this?", "Poor Pneumovax Response/Hypogammaglobulinemia Hello,  This week, I just learned my pneumovax-23 antibody titers did not respond in a meaningful way post vaccination.  I am either fortunate to have some sort of sufficient B-Cell immunity or the past year  has kept me from being exposed to infections, thus no CVID diagnosis at this time.   I have the requisite hypogammaglobulinemia that is a part of CVID.    My onset is after age 50, which is also considerably rare for a rare disease.      I am super fatigued and just so beat down I do not know where to go next.   I am continuing to work from home, but it is becoming increasingly difficult due to my health problems.     I probably should strongly consider taking some time for myself and give my job up.   Seems like it is possible to just work and work and then have the rug completely pulled out from you where you have no retirement time.      It is hard not knowing if you did something to induce this change or if this is simply a genetic change that was destined to occur.     \n\nI am not sure if I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop and start experiencing infections, or perhaps the autoimmune problems of CVID.   I would appreciate any information this group can offer to help me out. Hey,\n\nCVID can be very tough to get a handle on.\n\nUnfortunately this sub is pretty dead.\n\nI would advise to join the following groups on Facebook..\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth groups are absolutely amazing with tens of thousands of CVID from around the world. Facebook -  Just want to say hello. Same situation here, with a slightly earlier diagnosis. Low IgA &amp; IgM, but with normal IgG, so no formal diagnosis  beyond hypogammaglobulinemia. My immunologist moved away before she did subcategory testing on the IgG and there is not another immunologist available. Sounds like your next step is seeing a good immunologist for further testing. Thank you for your hello.   My IgM and IgG are low and IgA is low normal.   I see immunology at National Jewish in Denver, and they have tested me extensively.   Not sure what more testing they could do that would lead to treatment.   No plans for IVIG until infections or autoimmune sequelae begin. I do not really understand why they will not recommend IVIG or SCIG.  In addition to fatigue, you mention other health problems.  Do you have any gut issues that could help explain the fatigue?  Have they looked at your genetics?  I believe that IGG replacement can reduce fatigue and would positively impact your quality of life.  I can only assume they are monitoring your gut, liver, spleen, lungs and sinuses to make sure they react before your not-yet-CVID degrades your system?  I would probably seek a second opinion from a separate immunologist though what little I have heard of National Jewish in Denver was positive (albeit related to their pulmonology).  The idea that you would wait and watch someone with low immune globulins is a mystery to me and seems risky.  In other words, the IGG is to protect you so that you do not get an infection. I am not sure.  They are fellowship program in immunology and the attending concurs with the fellow treatment plan.    The last time I had IVIG, in November, I do not recall having a meaningful improvement in my fatigue.    \n\nI was hoping to find more case studies of adult onset hypogam with poor B-cell response but no recurrent refractory infections.   Not sure if I should go back to the doc who referred me to Jewish or maybe check out UCHealth. To me, IVIG is not so much a cure to something that ails you , it is more like a protective barrier that decreases your risk of future infection.  A short course of IVIG might not be a good indicator of whether its proper long-term use would help.  Your lack of respiratory tract infections could be because your IGA is protective. Each type of your immune globulins play a different role.  For most with CVID, all types are low to barely measurable.  There are, however, hundreds of other types of immune deficiencies and genetic testing might help someone narrow in on what is causing your blend of experiences.  In any case, I am sorry you are experiencing fatigue. It is frustrating not to be able to do what you used to be able to do.  If you get a chance, read this ( You will need to become accutely aware of what you can do and not do when you are fatigued.  Surround yourself with people who understand it. If you have the right relationship you might even be able to have a confidential discussion with a caring work place manager.  If you have disability insurance look into what it can do for you if the fatigue makes it so that you have to cut back hours or change roles.  I screwed this part up.  I wish I had used my disability insurance. You rock.  Thank you.  My employer has granted me an ada accommodation to work from home so I keep chugging along.   Just took a long walk with my wife and that did help some.  I have so much residual neuropathy and discomfort from my lumbar ssi that it is hard to know what the source of my symptoms are.   I had the same consideration about two one off doses of IVIG 8 mos apart and putting any stock in it not making me feel better.  I would think it could take several consecutive doses to really know.   I have a followup appointment in a week or so and will try to dig in a bit more and let my spine surgeon know the immunology treatment plan and figure he may have something to say about it, considering all the work he did to pull me back from the abyss.  Have a good day!", "Could this be CVID? I visited my allergist who did some immune system tests as a follow up to my asthma. The following results were flagged. Does this seem like CVID? Could the low IgG be a fluke? I have also been on steroids for three of the last five weeks for an asthma flare up. Could that be causing the low IgG levels?\n\n\nIgE (H): 142 kg/UL (reference range is below 104 \nIgG: (L): 472 (600-1640) \nIgA: 104 (47-310) \nIgM: 65 (50-300) That is why you get a vaccine and then come back after a month to see if you made antibodies.  No antibodies, then you have cvid. My numbers started somewhere around there when I got disseminated Shingles. I was vaccinated with a bunch a stuff but they did not order the next tests for some reason. I think they were just going with bc I randomly lost most of my immunities, like\nsuddenly I was not immune to Hep B, A, Typhoid, measles, yellow fever or smallpox. Basically, whatever vaccinations I received while in the Army were gone. I also began developing autoantibodies to random shit like my thyroid, muscles, skin, IGM, and bizarrely VonWilbrands and Factor VIII at some point.\n\nIt was a mess. \n\nAt the time I had no idea what was going on bc my autoimmune shit was pretty terrifying and I was very concerned with being unable to lift my arms above my head and some rashes that made me look like someone broke my nose. They did try IVIG, at the time I thought as a treatment for the Dermatomyositis, but apparently they were pretty sure I had CVID. Of course, I had an immediate allergic reaction tho so that was that, until I ended up in the hospital with Shingles and a rare pneumonia a couple months later (May).\n\nMy IGA was 41 (66-436) IGG was 278, (891-1643) and IGM was 39 (43-279). The CBC was a mess too so then they discharged me bc it was not really safe to be there anymore apparently. They also finally sent me to an actual civilian allergist. He was not very happy. I think he said 3 more years to be sure it is not Early Lymphoma or whatever (Dermatomyositis is highly associated with internal malignancy too) but it is apparently dangerous enough as is. \n\nOddly, I have also developed random allergies, like to CT Contrast which is weird bc it was like my 5th CT scan in the last 18 months, grass, and my poor cat. I have to be careful and especially trying new things. At present we are waiting to get approval for SubQ which is super important bc the Autoimmune treatments are farther suppressing my immune system and every time I get sick the rashes come back.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is do not let them wait it out or forget it is a thing bc it can kill you if you are not careful. The pneumonia did not show on the chest X-ray but a CT scan for swollen Lymph Nodes in neck my somehow revealed multiple ground glass nodules in both lungs. The wheezing was still pretty quiet even then. I do not and will not develop fevers or most of the common signs/symptoms even when very sick so it gets tricky. Im learning though and my Allergist gave me a script with his cell # on it just Incase I have to go to like urgent care or something bc I am only 30 and it sounds insane. \n\nI am not trying to be dramatic or scare you or anything and also know my case is exceedingly rare. Not just  bc my autoimmune disease is also very rare or the unusual presentation but bc the cause is actually Service Connected. They are pretty sure they have traced at least the CVID back to my first deployment and from what I understand there are 4 other women in Philly alone with CVID who were in Iraq and Kuwait between 09-10 just like me. Infectious Disease mentioned Sand Storms and Silica while others think it might be bc Anthrax bit there is always also idiopathic. \n\nYou are health is very important and waiting it and them out can be very dangerous. I love my Drs, they are amazing, but it is not an easy case to keep track of everything so I definitely have to. I keep copies of my Labs, Radiology Reports, and pictures of everything on my phone, especially after I found out just how sick I was/could get. It is important to begin the next step which is vaccination antibody response. Hopefully they will be normal and you will be good but it is not a great idea to wait. Best of luck! I am so sorry to hear about your experience! My lung function is good via spirometery tests. I have wheezing, but pretty much always have during allergy season. I have been on oral steroids for a few weeks for asthma at the time of the test, so not sure if this could have caused the low IgG levels. I was vaccinated at the time of the test and am going back in a month to test for antibodies. \n\nI am hoping the test results come back okay, and I hope your case is managed well moving forward. Thank you! Steroids can definitely cause low IGG, also A, and M all at once for sure. Good luck!!! My symptoms are not too far off from yours.  Research kept leading me to the gulf area and Vietnam.  I know there are burn pits all over there that veterans are suspect of being a factor (you probably know about the \u201cbrick factories\u201d).  I have never been to that area.  I grew up in the middle of northern forest nowhere and did not leave that area for most of my life.  What I did find out was Agent Orange was being dumped in my front yard at 700 times the level being used in Vietnam.  I remember watching them spray it along the train tracks and highway.  I drank well water and ate berries from the yard.  The healthcare in the area I lived in was not the best.  There are few records, but plenty of rare cancers.  Ironically, the Americans kept immaculate records of the whitefish population in the area.  Their immune systems were severely suppressed during that time as well - so much so, there was fear the stocks would collapse. Agent Orange is just the absolute worst. That is just awful and I am so sorry u got to deal with that shit. Anyone ever held responsible? How old were you? You have autoimmune too?\n\nI am on  all the meds rn but at present am still am in the middle of another short flare burst. I cannot even tell where the infection is really. I think maybe something either, ear, throat or mouth. My right parotid gland and cervical nodes are swollen so maybe that. I do not want to go to the Dr. tho bc I do not like CT scans.they scan me all the time. I get why they do it, the Dermato alone increases my risk for every single cancer at least by 6 and CVID has the Lymphoma and gastric thing but I would rather nap. Stupid, I know, but I am so so tired.\n\nDo you find sleeping helps to fight off infections? Sometimes, like with thrush, I can just rest enough for my immune system to work as best as it can. Sometimes it does not do shit and suddenly I am in the hospital. It is a very tiresome existence. \n\nHow did they find yours? Like what was it that led to the testing? My was mostly face shingles. \u201cGovernment forestry documents refer to extensive studies that were being conducted on spraying programs at a research facility in ., but these reports are either missing or misfiled.\u201d\n\nWhat are the chances?  I was a kid, so I was only around it near the end of the spraying.  It is speculation, but it is the only link I can find so far.\n\nAutoimmune?  Immunologist suspects MCTD.  I am consistently ANA neg, but ENA pos.  Got my hands on a test from the cancer clinic (done two years ago).  It was ANA positive.  Doctors were looking for ANA positive for decades because of my malar rash.  Found out my retic count was beyond low too.  I have had swollen glands since I was a kid.  I also get super hot and throw off insane amounts of heat from the back of my neck, but I never get a fever.  I was fairly healthy with the odd bout of pneumonia.  I was given the pneumonia shot a decade ago, then got pneumonia and fell inexplicably ill for six months.  I thought it was the shot, they said that was impossible, and it was labelled as severe depression even though the psychologist said I was the sanest person he met.  There was no medical explanation for that level of fatigue.  I got healthy again.  Four(ish) years ago I was a pinnacle of health training for a marathon, got the flu shot, then two weeks later - BAM!- beyond ill.  I was falling down, my nail beds would open and bleed, my vision kept changing in one eye (optometrist could not explain it, but kept changing my lenses), my nerves would not trigger my muscles properly (psysio could not explain it), lymph nodes swollen, hair started falling out, excruciating bone pain, allergic reactions to anything and everything, face and neck rashes resembling ground beef, radio-sensitivity... the list is endless.  I went to many specialists.  Low iron, low immunoglobulins, high WBC.  We cannot find an infection.  Like you, my vaccinations were wiped out.  It was found by a complete fluke.  Signs were in previous tests, but no one understood it.  My immunologist happens to work at a medical university and studied immune deficiencies (Google tells me).  Sleep helps.  100%.  I am on sleeping pills to ensure I get it.  If I am ill, I will sleep for two days solid then wake up healthier.  X-rays and vaccines hurt me, so I am kind of stuck.  It is a watch-and-wait scenario.", "New Diagnosee A couple weeks ago I learned that I have CVID. Was I shocked? No, not at all. My mom has it, and I have helped her do her infusions for years. She is perfectly capable of doing it on her own, but I need to be productive to keep from worrying.\n\nTo sum up my reaction, I followed the course my mom did to a tee, multiple infections as a child then a massive plummet around 18. I just turned 19 and have been tentatively waiting for the diagnosis, until now the pattern had a scary similarity, so there was never a doubt in my mind. You can call it pessimism, but I would like to think I was preparing myself.\n\nThe one thing I idiotically did not consider was the treatments. When the doctor called and explained that a subcontanious infusion worked better than an I.V. for my mom, I agreed. As soon as she hung up I began to have a breakdown.\n\nI have had feeding tubes and surgeries over the years, handled all the disaster of wrong medication for my epilepsy like it was nothing, but stabbing myself once a week with tiny needles was beyond me. I was reassured that it would not hurt, but no one seemed to get that pain was not the problem. The simple fact is that I do not have the nerve to do it.\n\nI cannot wrap my head around sitting there and calmly pushing needles under my skin. I am more likely to stab my arm in panic. When I do my self administered monthly aimovig injection I finish asap to be fast enough to hold off a breakdown until I am done. That is how bad it is.\n\nSimply put, I have this fear from personal experience rather than blind disturbance. Any idea how I can do this? Not to sound brash but it is what it is. It is not fair to have to go through these treatments but not too many things in life are fair. I can understand the difficulty with coming to terms that you will have to put a needle inside of yourself. It was difficult for me at first but as time goes on you will learn to overcome the fear. I have been doing subQ for 15 years and now it is just as much of a part of my week as doing dishes. The positives of subQ far outweigh IV treatment. I wish you luck with your future treatment and hope you will live a life with less illnesses. I understand your fear. I have to take Xanax in order to prepare myself for the IG infusion at my doctors. My nurse has taught me a way to not look at the needle and focus on a cough when she sticks me. That way all of my focus is trying to cough, rather than thinking about the needle. Maybe it might help if you have someone do it for you the first few times and do that trick. I would recommend if you do this trick, you might want to do the SubQ in your arm. I have not had any experience with SubQ, just the IVIG. But I feel the same way about SubQ and how everyone tells me \u201cit does not hurt\u201d. But it freaks me out too and that is why I have stuck with IVIG. Sadly I am too skinny to infuse into my arms confidently. Due to other health issues I am severely underweight, so there is not much surface area. I desperately wanted to do the IVIG instead, but it did not work for my mom, so chances are it will not help me. I was diagnosed in 2010. At the time I was terrified of needles, like sweating for a flu shot scared. I hated ivig and having a needle. It took a solid 2 or three years of constant needle pokes to get used to it. Now I do scig at home, and still have days where poking myself is overwhelming and it may take an hour just to get 3 needles in. Other days I can do it right away. I am not sure if this is helpful, but you are not alone. You will \u201cget used to it\u201d but it will take time and there will still be bad weeks. However, you are stronger than these treatments and, like the other difficulties you have overcome, you will be able to manage and get it done. \nGood luck. You are NOT alone. Thank you. I just started giving myself a leg injection, like I said, but it takes a second to keep my hands from shaking. That is just the placement of a single needle(granted it is a decent gauge and shoots out within a second of hitting the button). Do not worry or sweat it. I infuse Gammagard 2.5g SUBQ everynight. You get used to it.", "Medical resident diagnosed with CVID. Hi, recently I was diagnosed with CVID. I am in medical school, currently on my pediatric rotation. I would really like to know the experiences of other med students or doctors who have this condition, especially with regard to combining subcutaneous treatment and the condition itself with rotations. I know it is long stretch, but I just stumbled upon this subReddit and hoped to get in touch with someone. \n\nThanks in advance!", "Probiotics?? Hello,\n\nDo you guys take probiotics?? I have read conflicting info online, some doctors say people with immunodeficiencies should avoid probiotics.  I have chronic sibo due to my CVID, I also read that people with CVID have different microbiomes in their gut then healthy people (ppl with CVID tend to have more pathogenic bacteria then beneficial ones). So I started drinking kefir, it has only been a day but I feel noticeably worse.  Am I just being paranoid, anyone else take probiotics?", "I feel guilty for being alive right now and being awkward-coronavirus Hi, \n\nI am 27 years old. \nI have common variable Immunodeficiency, and chronic asthma.  \n\nI take blood plasma because I have no antibodies and I am on antibiotics several times a year. \n\nIf you give blood. \nThank you.... \n\nI have been shielding from coronavirus for the past few months. \n\nHowever shielding has now ended, and I was phoned the monday after shielding ended to ask me when I was starting a new job. \n\nI feel as though everyone is treating me as though I chose to have the conditions I have. \n\nThat i chose to be Immunodeficient, and that I am somehow being awkward by wishing to safeguard what is left of my health. \n\nI am not keen to do a 10 week course in an area where there are a lot of cases. \n\nI feel as though I am being awkward and that everyone is judging me as lazy and deliberately non compliant.  \n\nI feel guilty for wanting to live. \n\nI feel ashamed for not being suicidal, and being inconvenient to the rest of society.  \n\nI am having daily anxiety attacks also. \n\nI do not wish to die but I wish I was not born if that makes sense.", "Autoimmune issues and Covid vaccine? I have seen a few reports (one from the NYT is linked here) of a very small number of people with previously unknown or undetected pre-existing conditions developing autoimmune thrombocytopenia after receiving both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. From everything I have read, this is just anecdotal, and there has not been enough research to determine if there is a causal relationship between the two. My immunologist is on an indefinite leave of absence and I have not been able to get an appointment with a new one yet, and in the meantime I am trying to do some research. I have CVID and I have had occasional flare-ups of autoimmune thrombocytopenia in the past, and if there actually IS a correlation with the vaccine, I would be a little nervous about it re-activating it. Has anyone heard anything more about this issue? I am not sure if this is of any help but having cvid and the astra zenika vaccine, the only side affects I had was feverish symptoms for around 16 hours and the vaccine site still hurts now a few days after, yet to see anything else Are you taking IV immune replacement? I do, and my immunologist told me to get it as soon as I can. I have my appointment next week. I had a chance to get the vaccine last week. I just called and talked to him. Maybe you could call and get his/her recommendations even before your appointment?  I felt achy for about 24 hours and it happened to fall on the day I get my IVIG. By the next day I was fine. Thanks, good to know, that is reassuring... those are pretty much the same side effects that everyone I know who has had the vaccine have experienced. Thanks, that is helpful and glad you did not have any side effects that were too serious. I am on monthly IVIG, and I am due for it this week, actually. I will give them a call and see what they say, if there is any risk of interaction for me. So I also have ITP (it seems to come and go and they thought that was weird, glad to know I am not the only one!)\n\nFor what it is worth, my immunologist wants me to get the vaccine as soon as I am able Thanks, that definitely puts my mind at ease somewhat! Did they have any concerns about it affecting the ITP?\n\nAnd also glad to know I am not the only one... My platelets are always on the low end (\\~100k), but every few years they will drop to 75 or even 50.  Usually it resolves on its own pretty quickly, but I have had to go on low-dose prednisone once or twice to clear it up. My doctor did not mention any concerns with the vaccine and my ITP\n\nYeah my last platelet count was just inside the normal range. I have been as low as 20 before and was hovering between 40 and 70 for quite a while I just received an email on this upcoming webinar:  ( being organized by the Immunoglobulin National Society.  That is specifically related to the topic of ITP and vaccines.  The webinar is on February 22nd. By any chance did you attend this webinar?

Yes, there is a test to see if you have antibodies to the spike protein which is from the vaccine. Not the nucleocapsid which is from the infection. Roche does the test. I paid out of pocket in Irvine, CA. I have CVID and also did not respond to the pneumonia vaccine. And I formed antibodies. As well as my sister who has CVID and she formed a great response too. \n\nHere is a list of testing sites\n\nYou can also find one through US Biotek for the spike protein Thank you!\n\nIt looks like it is only good if you were infected though?\n\n\"The Roche assay will detect IgM, IgA, or IgG antibodies if they are high affinity antibodies, which appear in the late or convalescent phase of infection\" I think that is just in general. That same verbiage is there for the nucleocapsid test. Nucleocapsid for infection, Spike for vaccination. I did the nucleocapsid test as well and it was negative. Never suspected I had COVID though. There is a test, and it tracks both antibodies after an infection and the vaccine. I have had it done and have no antibodies after 2nds dose of mRNA vaccine so I cannot say anything about my experience with a third vaccine since my doc is on the fence of having me have one too. But you definitely take a test.\n\nEDIT btw I am the same as you I never responded to any vaccines and I get sub IvIG weekly Ahhh. OK. Thank you!\n\nLabcorp does the spike. It would not make sense that if the vaccine causes you to make antibodies that said antibodies *would not* show on an antibody test.\n\nBefore they realized I had CVID,I was asked to join a community spread study and they provided us with finger-stick, rapid *antibody* thest kits.\n\n\nIt has been approved in the US for research purposes. 87.5% specificity rate.\n\n**\"The SARS-CoV-2 test is manufactured by the Chinese biotechnology company INNOVITA and has been used extensively in\u00a0China\u00a0for aiding in the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Is there any reason you can think of that those *would not* test for the same thing LabCorp spike does?\n\nI guess I could use my husband as a control...?\n\nI know mine was negative prior to the vaccine. Good. Thank you.\n\nI have some antibody finger tests as part of a research study (before they realized I had CVID) I was negative pre-vaccine, so I might see if I get a positive result.

I have CVID with T-Cell  immunoregulatory dysfunction. \n\n\"The IDF had a forum YESTERDAY (!) that might help answer some of your questions or be helpful. They toss them all up on yt, so here is the link for you (it is long, but worth it.) They also have a few other really good vids that help answer our questions (and fears) when it comes to Covid and PI disorders:  \"\n\nI also have some antibody test strips that give a 15 min result.

If his us Pos (or neg) I will get the test done.\n\nFwiw, when I was researching this it said that if you are on IgG that you generally get a mild course, even if you had no antibody response.\n\nI had a reaction to the vaccine, did you? What is IDF and PID? English is not my native language, sorry!  \n\n\nOn one hand that you are saying mild cases  with patients that are on IgG seem common calms me down (obviously living pretty much in fear for over a year now) but on the other hand my doc is pretty worried about me catching the virus... then again I am also immunocompromised with meds as well (I am on Mycophenolatmofetil and had Rituximab 2 years ago), so I do not know if the mild case could apply to me.   \n\n\nAnd nope, no reaction except for a sore arm when I had the first shot.

Other countries can do this as well.\n\nIf your T cell status is OK, the medical hospital my immunologist works for (Duke) policy (3 weeks ago) was that only organ transplants needed another shot.\n\nSome Drs are still giving a 3rd dose anyway.\n\nThere are manmade monoclonal antibodies (isolated IgG for covid) that can be given if you do them in the first 10 days.  So you can get a blood draw if you have symptoms (or get the Abbot home test now in the US) and if you have covid they can give you man made IgG.\n\nSomewhere in this thread I put a link to a video put out by IDF that someone told me explained covid in the face if immune deficiency.\n\nI had some tests kits from a clinical trial that test for IgG and IgM for covud at home, and I did one last night and it showed IgG antibodies. \n\nIt was not as dark as the control, so I am not sure if that means anything.  I think I am going to get the labcorp test to see what my levels are. how are yall getting third doses? Just showing up at CVS or asking your dr. to prescribe you a third dose? Well, I got my initial doses from the state in one of those big parking lots.\n\nWeirdly my immunologist with Duke is not giving out ANY doses..and like I mentioned it appears that Duke as a very protective 'party line response'.  I do not think they want to give a vax in case they get suesed, and they *certainly* are not tailoring to individual patients.\n\n2 days after I wrote that post my Driect Care Model  primary care doctor emailed out that they were partnering with Blah and doing a vaccine clinic on Aug 6th with all 3.\n\nI asked and made a case that it was now standard in Europe (see below) and could I please get a third dose.\n\nThey had me write a release of liability and said sure.

Hi everyone! I recently had my blood tested and my iron levels were through the roof! Triple the norm (over 300), and the lab double tested it because it was so wild. I cannot possibly figure out why (I do not eat red meat...), and am going to get retested next week in case it was a fluke. But I thought I would ask... have any of you experienced this since starting IVIG? (Also.. my ferritin levels were normal--45). I never have.", "Can CVID be passed through children? My mum was diagnosed 14 years ago and I have seen her through her diagnosis and treatments. \n\nI am just wondering if I could be passed onto me and my children? The only reason why I ask is I have had a cough/cold I have not been able to get rid off, plus loose stools since March. I have always suffered with ear infections etc.. \n\nOr am I just thinking too much into it? Yes, it can be passed. It is genetic.  Go get checked. I will.. it might explain alot of things! Both my two kids have it. Although I always have  been told the changes are really small.", "Covid Antibody Test- IGg vs IGm Hi all! Need your expertise while waiting for doctor to call back.   \nMy husband has CVID. He had bronchitis in late summer. He got steroids and antibiotics, and after that episode, I wanted him to see an immunologist. That dr put him back on infusions (long story). Anyway, we waited a little after that, about 2 weeks, and he got his booster shot (#3 moderna) a few weeks ago. He then waited two and a half weeks after the booster, and got a Covid antibody test. We got the results today, and it showed his IGg as negative for Covid antibodies, but his IGm was positive (I forget the number- 11?) . Anyway, at the time, his doctor said maybe the bronchitis was a mild covid case (though he didnt have any covid specific symptoms like loss of taste and smell, etc...). However, reading online, could not the IGm result be from the booster shot he got? I am just trying to understand all this! We went to his PCP for this stuff, and are waiting for a call from immunologist. Anything you recommend I ask the immunologist? Thanks so much! I had a roughly similar experience.   For reference my IGgs are extremely low without treatment.  IgMs are weak but detectable.  IgAs show up as undetectable on blood tests.\n\nI have been getting infusions of Gammaguard (IgG) for a few years.  Got my COVID shots as soon as I could - back in February and March.  I wondered if this would actually work.  In theory, if my immune system is \"broken\" and does not produce IG's, then will it respond to a vaccine?  I asked my immunologist and she said no one really knows the answer to that.  Got blood tested and it came back positive for antibodies.  I asked my immunologist again - does this mean the vaccine worked, or does it just mean I am picking up antibodies from my infusions?  Gammaguard is made from blood donors so in theory I am getting immunity from those who are vaccinated.  Again, my immunologist said there is no way to be sure. \nIn response to an infection or vaccination with a live virus, IgM antibodies usually are made first, followed by IgG and some other types of antibodies.\n\n\nIgG is more of your long-term. As you can see from the chart (link below) it may take some time for your husband's IgG to reach the threshold level detected by the COVID-19 antibody test. \n\n\n(\n\n\nEdit: because your husband is triple vaccinated, there is no way to tell between antibodies made from a recent infection vs. from the 3rd dose. \n\n\nYou may find traces of viral DNA from a PCR (dead viral particles your husband's body fought off) but given he was vaccinated and the case seemed mild, his body might have fought off the virus and cleared dead viral particles by now. Had he taken maybe a rapid antigen test while he had bronchitis symptoms, it probably would have come back positive if he caught COVID-19 but the window for that is gone now. \n\n\nTesting is quite tricky and some physicians do not really understand the windows these tests have to be executed based on symptoms. (I say this as a health professional who used to work with doctors in the hospital for a decade). Very helpful, thanks! Thanks for all the info. Interesting you had antibodies on the first test. There is so much to unpack, and so much that is still not known. My husbands first immunologist said he was not getting infections, so he did not need infusions. Second dr took, one look at his levels and said he needed to start infusions right away! Thanks for info re your medicine. Take care!!", "No Immune Response to mRNA Vaccine After two antibody blood test it seems I have had little to no immune response to the Moderna COVID vaccine. Any other CVID patients with a similar experience? My doctor suggested I also get the J&amp;J vaccine since it is a different formulation so I received that yesterday.\n\nInterestingly my doctor was not sure if I would be able to get the J&amp;J vaccine since I already received the Moderna. He thought the provider might reject me at the door even though they accepted my registration online. Long story short, there was no issue \u2014 they (the provider) did not ask and I did not mention it. I have read a story of a transplant surgeon who is himself a heart transplant recipient. Due to his anti-rejection drugs he did not react to the mRNA vaccine. He was then given the J&amp;J vaccine and had a robust and normal antibody response. I hope it works for you. If you are in the US I do not see how they would know. On the paperwork check no on covid vaccines and just make sure you have had no other vaccines for 10 days prior. And if female, not pregnant. Gives them no cause for pause and you will get J&amp;J. I hope you have a response. Either way, please let us know. I also have not had a response though I had Pfizer. Basically it just did not work, I assume it is because I have no B lymphs. A few people in the Facebook groups also did not respond. I was not even aware you could have more than one but I hope J&amp;J works for you you! I have cvid and had a response to the Pfizer. ( I was fortunate enough to develop antibodies from Moderna. Unfortunately it sound like it comes down to the luck of the draw per individual. I have CVID and I had 2 doses of the Pfizer.", "I suspect I might have CVID. Hello all. I am very fatigued, so sorry if I miss some stuff. I am diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome and POTS, F, mid-30s. \n\nI started to get worse around March 2020. I have had lab test last March, my IGG and IGA we are both low, beneath the threshold. Also had issues with other bit/TSH.\n\nI got tested again this week. I got worse since then. I feel constantly ill. Thing is, I got a COVID shot on August 24th, and then 3 Rabies shots + Tetanus in September (I feel like death). Still, I got the labs after the shots. IGG and IGA still below the normal threshold. I can barely walk, take a shower. I am so tired. \n\nIt might take awhile to get to a specialist as I am disabled with no support. Is it possible that I have it (IGG + IGA are too low, feel like crap, got homebound, still too low after major vaccination).\n\nWhat is your input? I may add that I am not from an English speaking country. Are you on thyroid medication?\n\nHave you checked for Celiacs or Gluten Sensitivity? This can cause the stomach upset.  It took about 4 months of being gluten free before I started feeling better in this regard. \n\nAlso your iron levels and adrenal cortisol levels?\n\nI mention these,  because I suffer from many of the same.  I have CVID,  Hypothyroidism, Anemia, Celiacs, and Low cortisol. All of which cause extreme fatigue.  I do not get sick very often, because I am constantly taking precautions to prevent and I do not go many places.   I did have my tonsils removed years ago, and have not had strep throat since then.  I am not on infusions yet for CVID, but I am hovering at the threshold of what my Dr thinks is necessary. \n\nI hope you find the help you need to feel better. Thank you, I do not get why I got downvoted (Yeah, my English is wonky, it happens).\n\nI am currently on a med for my thyroid, and TSH is within range. I have anemia, although my vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron are okay, need to look into that. I tested for Celiacs a few years ago, I was negative. I also have low sodium, as well as low protein, there is some problem with absorption. I have got no idea about my Cortisol levels, though.\n\nI am new to this condition, it might explain a lot, but it is quite scary. I appreciate your comment. \n\nMay I ask how did you get your diagnosis and what are your symptoms? Did it take long to diagnose? Are you considering infusions?  Thanks. Specifically for CVID, I found out by accident.  Even though I was having all these symptoms,  it was being dismissed.  I went to a Gastroenterologist, because of the chronic stomach issues and diarrhea.  One of the labs they did was checking my IGG levels.  That is where I found out I had the deficiency.  \nHere is a link that talks about Gastro issues, \nspecifically with Primary Immune Deficiency  \nI then went to specialists from there. Thank you. Yeah, the GI symptoms and malabsorption are there indeed. Are you already taking IVIG or SCIG  to treat the immune deficiency?  That would be a good first step and might help with some of the baseline symptoms but not autoimmune issues. Before getting treated with IGG we are all more susceptible to various gut bacteria which could also be a contributor to the way you feel.  You might get a stool test done if you have not already.  In my case, prophylactic Azithromycin (MWF) alleviated most of my sinus issues.  Prophylactic Xifaxan combined with Cholestyramine helped with my malabsorption which helped me gain lost weight and regain energy.  I hope you feel better, I especially dislike being fatigued. Thank you. That is very informative. Not yet I will have to talk to my GP and get a referral to a specialist. Hopefully the specialist will be available through tele-conversation, cause I am mostly homebound.\n\nAlso, as fatigued and sick as I am, I might try to move away from this city. People have volunteered to help me move, although it is not perfect. But it is important to me. I only got the results yesterday, and it is the second time my IGg and IGa are low. \n\nI cannot remember when I smelled and breathed fully without a congested nose and sinus head pressure. And it is actually possible to absorb better the protein, sodium and other stuff? I lost so much hair.\n\nThing is, I am too scared. I have had a rough year and I focused on getting out of here because of my abusive family. I do not know how to handle the possibility of having CVID. It is a lot to take in. I would start with an immunologist, get the right diagnosis and if appropriate start Immune Globulin treatments.  Yes, you can get better. Knowing what is causing your new issues is a good first step. I know how frustrating it is to be sick all the time and want answers, so I wish you well. When you say your IgG and IgA levels are below normal, what are the specific numbers? These are my levels after getting 5 vaccines in 3 weeks. Not extremely low, I do not know if it is enough for a diagnosis. IgM is within range.\n\n Thanks. Another Redditor asked for my values, here they are after receiving 5 vaccines in 3 weeks. IGm is withing range. I am not sure if it is low enough, to be honest.\n\n Ig levels can fluctuate for a number of reasons. If yours did fall below normal due to vaccines/medications, it would be considered secondary, and not a primary immunodeficiency like CVID.  (And are more likely to bounce back without intervention.) Looking at your numbers, while they are a bit lower than normal, they are not the 2 standard deviations below normal that the diagnosis of CVID requires.  At your current level of 634, you are unlikely to qualify for IVIG, for example.\n\nThe best thing you can do is find a qualified immunologist, so they can test all your Ig levels (IgG, A, E, M), and administer a vaccine titer test. Even if you do not have CVID, you may have SAD (Specific Antibody Deficiency).  The good news is that even if it takes a bit of time to see the specialist, your numbers are high enough that you should be fine for now.  \n\nHope that helps!", "Newly Diagnosed I was diagnosed with CVID Tuesday.  I had very low levels of IGA IGM AND IGG.  I have had asthma that has been getting worse since 09.  I have had stomach problems since 2012.  I have had issues with fatigue and sleep since 2016.  I had nose surgery in 2019 and was hospitalized with flu and pneumonia in February of 2020.\n\nI had written off ever finding an answer for any of this.  We found it because my wife saw in my chart where I had low IGA in 2011.  She is a nurse and was looking in my file to see if insurance would cover a blood sugar monitor.  They told me then there was nothing to do about it.\n\nI was shocked to find an answer and to hear I might feel better.  I do not know if I am having trouble accepting it but when I read other people's stories it just seems like they have been sick more than I have.  My wife is a nurse so I understand that my blood tests show what they show but I have a couple questions if anyone can give me feedback.\n\n1.  Can I have this and have only been hospitalized 3 times for sickness?  Maybe I am struggling with acceptance.\n2.  I got my third vaccine yesterday per their immediate orders.  I do not see how I have not caught Covid?  I had to work during all this everyday.  I have been around so many people that have had it.\n3.  My wife and son were very concerned to see life expectancy with CVID to be 50 according to Google.  Do we know what that is based on?  Will treatments increase that or is it a current estimation with infusions etc.  I start those soon.\n\nThank you so much.  Information on this is hard to find. I have CVID and have never had\npneumonia or been hospitalized. The life expectancy is low if you are not on treatment because you can get infections so easily. It is not going to be CVID that kills you, but the infection. Yes, it is a surprise you have not gotten Covid but I know there is some research about us and bacterial infections vs viral infections. It also tells us that masks and vaccine work. Check out primaryimmune.org for some great resources. I also highly recommend starting subcutaneous immune globulin as soon as possible. (Just saw where you said you were staring soon) I was diagnosed because I had 9 sinus infections in one year and my IG helps\nme so much that I have only had 3 in the past 2 years. That may also be helped by working from home, wearing a mask, and not being around people but I also feel better physically. Facebook has a ton of great support groups but beware that they can be a little scary at first because many people get on and just talk about the bad stuff. Please do not hesitate to message me if you have questions. I have been diagnosed since 2013. Thank you so much. I was diagnosed with CVID in March 2020, after my first and only hospitalization. I would been having increasing respiratory infections for about 10 years, but it had only been noticeably bad in the 6 months since my diagnosis. So when you say you have been hospitalized 3 times, to me, that is a lot! I am glad your wife noticed your IG levels\u2014 this condition can often go undiagnosed for a long time.\n\nI am not a doctor, so ask yours, but I am fairly certain the 45-50 year life expectancy was from before there was effective IG replacement therapy. According to my immunologist, if you are receiving regular IG treatment, your life expectancy is basically the same as anyone else\u2019s. Do follow up with your doctor on that, but do not worry too much about it in the meantime. \n\nThere are several Facebook groups that are a lot more active than this subreddit. I personally did not find them to be super helpful and left them after ~6 months, but for a lot of people they seem to be a good source of information. I would also suggest signing up with the ( if you have not already. They have a lot of resources and offer regional support groups. \n\nMy best advice is to find really good medical support. I have found it to be critical to have an immunologist who is very hands-on and communicative and follows up with other specialists, etc. It is also been helpful to find a good primary care provider who is willing to work with me and my immunologist \u2014 from now on, you are going to need care that is a bit different from \u201cnormal\u201d people\u2019s, and you need someone who really gets that. If you happen to live in the DC area, I would be happy to share my doctors; if not, that might be a good question to put to those Facebook groups. \n\nGood luck! I know that this diagnosis can feel strange and unsettling (especially right now!). Hope you get the support you need. I have lived with CVID for 43 years. There are varying degrees of CVID. On the spectrum of severe to mild I would describe my case as somewhere between severe and moderate.\n\nThe COVID vaccine had little to no immune response for me but for others it is quite the opposite. How I have not gotten COVID either is a bit of a mystery but there is been a definite shift in the last two months as to how my doctor discusses the virus with me. He is gone from discussing how I can avoid COVID and what to do *if* I get it to now he talks about what to do *when* I get it.\n\nAs scary as CVID may be for you right now, I promise you will find day to day life a bit better now that you are diagnosed and eligible for treatment. I have grown up with CVID and do not really know any different. Going to my infusion appointments is just something I do like brushing my teeth or taking the dog for a walk. Thank you.  That is reassuring.  They are going to test my antibodies for Covid after this 3rd dose.  We could have tested them already but I am getting the third regardless so they wanted to wait until after. I was diagnosed in my 20s about 20 years ago. Had infections most of my life and pneumonia 6 or 7 times but have never been hospitalized. In fact, I consider myself to generally be in good health. Some days are worse then others, but I rarely find that I cannot get through it and have been able to advance my career to an executive level. My chronic migraines are more limiting than the CVID.\n\nAll CVID patients are different. I am low in all 3 as well, but I am able to function well at a 700 or 800 trough (right before infusion) on IGG (no replacement available for IGA or IGM). Others struggle with complications and secondary conditions (e.g , we are prone to autoimmune diseases, certain cancers). As someone else noted, CVID itself is not devastating, but it makes you susceptible to things that are. That can be mitigated somewhat with aggressive health care--and a little good luck.\n\nI, too, have seen and even experienced the differences in how CVID responds differently to bacterial versus viral infections. I seem to have more issues with bacterial infections. \n\nAs for t cells, if yours are normal, you may still receive benefit from the COVID vaccination, and that may have helped in you not yet getting COVID. My doctors tell me to act like I am unvaccinated, but a spike protien test indicates that I may have received benefit from the COVID vaccine via its impact on t cells.\n\nMy best advice? We are all different, and what works for one may not work for you. When you have questions or are curious about something you saw on here or one of the other CVID groups, be sure to communicate with qualified medical specialists for the info and actions best suited for your unique condition.\n\nBest of health to you! Thank you.  I am in Alabama but think I have a good Doctor at the moment.  A lot to absorb for now. I write this while at the hospital for my monthly IVIG. The very first one many years ago was a BLESSING. Do not fear the diagnosis--I embraced it, because it started to explain so many things and gave me a path to do something about it. Thank you so much.  It does feel like a blessing.  I have had so many tests and been to so many Doctors so an answer is a prayer answered. I was never hospitalized. I had an easy experience with covid.  Having a less reactive immune system may actually help because it is the over-reactive response that kills people. With immunoglobulins, life expectancy is normal.  Welcome to the tribe. Roll Tide.  No War Eagle in my household.  Hahaha. My wife went to Alabama, but I am from California. I do subcutaneous at home and learning to infuse yourself is convenient.  You will get accustomed to the needles.  It is not so bad. I have CVID and my levels were pretty severely low when I first got diagnosed, but I have never had pneumonia or even bad bronchitis and had only been hospitalized once in my life for an asthma attack. When I first got it i also struggled to believe it was true. I had been seriously ill in the past but nothing ever life threatening or something that put me in the hospital. It is hard to accept especially if you have only had relatively \"mild\" symptoms, but your diagnosis is just as valid as any other!\n\nI also never got COVID despite someone in my own home having it, and this was before my vaccination! I had only a partial response to the vaccine, but some are just luckier than others when it comes to COVID.\n\nIn regards to the life expectancy stuff you may see on Google, just know those studies are not only from many years ago, but refer to people who were not receiving igg replacement therapy, and also people who died of other severe complications of CVID like cancer or lung disease. Very rarely do those studies reflect modern day medicine and people who are actively receiving treatment. It freaked me out a lot in the beginning to see the prognosis stuff on the internet, but as you learn more about CVID you will find many people who live well into their 70's or onward. Being diagnosed is terrifying at first but it is definitely not a guaranteed death sentence. \n\nThere is a lot to learn upon being diagnosed but as you live with it I am sure you will find your natural rhythm and ways to make this whole experience easier on yourself. Good luck on your journey :) Well, my husband has it, he didnt find out until about 54, and he is 61 now, so I dont think the life expectancy is quite accurate! And he was never told that, btw.  My husband didnt get sick alot- but he seemed to catch bronchitis or ear infections every winter. He got a chest xray after one bout, and after a battery of tests, and a trip to Dana Farber for a second opinion, he was diagnosed. He did produce some antibodies to Covid after the second shot, so that was a nice suprise. He was recently re-tested and doesnt have any now, but it is about 8 months since the previous shot, so... he just got his 3rd shot. We are continuing to be careful, only necessary outings to doctors, etc... and masks anytime we are out of the house. He teaches school, and they wont let him teach from home-so he is considering retirement instead, as things are just too crazy in the schools right now. Take care, a new diagnosis is always hard, and dont be afraid to ask questions! that is interesting about bacterial vs viral. Can you elaborate or point me to an article? I have heard about the over responsiveness being the thing that kills people as well! I was diagnosed at 19 after one particularly nasty upper respiratory infection, which led to them finding some abnormalities in my lungs and lots of blood work (which is what revealed CVID). I was never a child that was always sick, had never been hospitalized for an infection previously, have never been hospitalized since. So, you definitely do not have to be someone who is always sick to have CVID. \n\nI definitely understand how strange it can be to get used to. For me it was kind of a shock. I went from fine, to very sick, to being diagnosed with CVID in the coarse of basically 4 months. I now do weekly home infusions without any issues. It is hard at first, but I promise you will get used to it. Now, the hardest thing for me about having CVID is dealing with the insurance people. Otherwise, it is just become a natural part of my life, and it is has not really kept me from doing anything I really wanted to do. I have been reading and discussing so much with people but something about this rings truest.  I think it is some kind of weird backwards psychology I am trying to play on myself.  \"I do not deserve CVID.  I have not earned it.  I have not been sick enough.\" Lol but these words seem like myth busted and life goes on.  So thank you. I think your reaction is a completely natural one. Hang in there! It WILL get better! Shoot, sorry I missed this. I apologize for the delayed response. I may have been too simplistic in that statement. I was referring to the cytokine storm that happens with Covid and we may or may not be able to produce that. However, I did learn that we may be more susceptible to certain types of viral infections. Here is a couple articles that may be helpful. There are also some videos about CVID and Covid on the IDF website. \n\n(\n\n(", "Did your fatigue and weaknesses got better once you have started IGg therapy? It is going to take awhile till I will be able to see an immunologist. My current GP is useless and will not give me a referral. I am not sure it is CVID, but my body's surely defecifent in IGg.\n\nI am weak. Cannot barely get out of bed. Brain fog. Chronic sinusitis, sore throat, even my lungs kind of hate me.\n\nI do have other dxs, but the lack of enough IGg might be the cause for some of this. Any positive stories? It is going to take awhile, but I know we have a cure. I just need to wait to get it and not lose hope. Please tell me you can regain some energy. I can barely type. For some, it is a miracle drug. Life returns. Unfortunately for some, me included, it makes us feel worse. Imagine worse. It is hell. And, full disclosure, for some, it is worse at first but after about 8 months, the tide turns and it is better. \n\nAdd to your list of doctor appts, infectious disease.  You could have CVID but also be suffering from any number of active bacterial or viral infections that your body cannot fight off, or worse, is incapable of \u201cseeing it\u201d and thus will never mount a defense. I had similar symptoms except it was my lungs, not my sinuses.  I do sub q infusions weekly.  I feel better, but still have some symptoms like fatigue, brain fog and muscle soreness.  Not ever day, and not as severe as before.  So it is definitely improved my quality of life but it is not a miracle drug for me.  I have not had pneumonia since starting, so I deal with the rest. It helped me No.  The constant sinus infections stopped completely.  I just do not feel any less fatigue. \n\nI am currently awaiting the results of a genetic test for CVID.  Not sure if it is worth it.  I have been getting infusions for 4 years now.  If it is CVID, I need the infusions.  Even if it is not, I still need the infusions.  Repeated blood tests and years of treatment prove it. I am definitely waiting to see. I just started infusions after the years of sinusitis, infections, and major fatigue. The first infusion completely knocked me on my arse for 10 days, but now I am definitely back to pre-infusion level, here is hoping it goes up from here. So hard to know, and I am sorry you are having to go through it too, the unknowns are so exhausting. 10 days? Oh my. How did you feel? I am glad you are feeling better. I hope you will improve, fingers crossed.\n\nAt least I will not stumble into this blindly. That is a lot. I am mostly pissed because I will have to wait a long time for a specialist, but the labs are there. Yeah, having to wait sucks, and definitely having your eyes open helps. I never got to talk to my specialist before the infusion, just an immunology registrar, and they were not exactly forthcoming with how the experience might be. They just said \u201cyou might have a headache the day of, but you will be fine, I have not heard of anyone having much more of an issue than that\u201d. Meanwhile, I arrived for the infusion and finally get to see the specialist and she says that it is going to be rough and will take about six months to get easier, and that I will feel pretty bad for a few days. \n\nIt was mainly that I was woozy and incredibly tired, bit of heart racing, and everything ached like flu, but my spine and neck still ache nearly 3 weeks on. I have never felt so aware of my spine before, anyone else experienced this?\n\nHonestly, knowing that this is a way forward and that hopefully things will improve, and at least I will be less sick, makes it shitty, but not so hard to go through the rough bit. Caveat: I did not have fatigue when I was diagnosed or now. For me, the infusions have no effect on how I feel. (I infuse every 3 weeks.) They prevent me from getting infections, but I feel exactly the same the day before, the day of, and the day after. I think how you react to infusing is pretty individual. Good luck! I feel better than I ever have in my life. But the first year or two I was really affected by the infusions in terms of side effects like headache/nausea. Then they slowed it down and I am just tired day of. Definitely changed my entire life for the better.", "Has anyone with CVID been to India? Did you have vaccinations? I am aware people with CVID can not get certain travel vaccinations although unsure which ones and why.  Generally speaking you should be weary of vaccines made of live-attenuated virus. These are a specific type of vaccine that are basically made by using a very weak form of the live virus. For some people with immune conditions it could trigger the actual disease. It definitely warrants a discussion with your health provider before receiving those types of shots. That being said, there are very few vaccines made that way that are travel related. The primary ones of concern for travel would probably be yellow fever or small pox. So it depends on what area of the world/India that you are traveling to if you would need those vaccines. Your physician should consult the yellow book to determine if it is recommended in that part of India you are travelling to.\nAll that being said I have CVID and have received yellow fever vaccine with no bad side effects. I do not remember if I specifically received it prior to a trip to India though. I have travelled a fair bit and do not remember if it was for my India or Peru or Brazil trip that I got yellow fever shot. I do remember the shot burned like crazy. Beep. Boop. I am a robot.\nHere is a copy of \n\n###( \n\nWas I a good bot? | ( | (", "CVID + Diet What do you feel works best for you and your CVID? I have tried many, many things, and am still dealing with an upset stomach. I have microscopic colitis on top of CVID. \n\nA while ago a doctor told me paleo would be the best diet for me. Currently vegan and feel conflicted with the environmental impact of a paleo diet.  \n\nWould love to hear what works for all of you! Best book and best success I have had is this book: The two-edge sword diet, forward by Dr Brice Vickery. Changed my life. The book is only on  for $25. Def follow the guidelines in the book.

That is a low residue diet with recipes for vegans.", "Holistic/Natural Treatment Options for CVID?? Posting on behalf of my husband - what is everyone is experience with natural treatment options for CVID (in addition to tradition transfusions and modern medicine). I figured that with this condition it is all hands on deck to try to manage it to help with quality of life and life expectancy. What alternative treatments have you tried and how has it helped you? I can only speak for myself and my life\u2019s experience. I am an older person now but was brought up very holistically. I make good money and for decades I used my means for every single thing you can think of that would be holistic. Nothing worked. I suffered horrendously. Turns out the only thing that worked/works was to get my sinuses done and antibiotics (the best one being Levaquin when things get really bad).  As an aside, my body rejects IGG and I have tried them all; IV and SubQ. I wrote a very long post about all the things I tried about 4 years ago. You can search for it. \n\nNot at all saying not to try. Go for it. Just providing data, communication, best wishes, and love. God speed. Thank you for your response! I will definitely search for that post. Thanks for this, good to know! I do not think this is exactly what you are asking about, but my doctor always stresses that I should be taking care of my body as much as possible. Stuff like regular exercise, good nutrition, enough sleep, regular checkups; hell, even good dental care, etc. \n\nThat stuff does not affect CVID directly, but I think her point is that my body\u2019s already at a disadvantage health-wise, and it can really help to not dig the hole deeper, if that makes sense. (And I do not think I have the mental bandwidth to deal with more health problems, so I kind of see the wisdom of it, haha!)\n\nSending good vibes to you and your husband! IV ozone has been the only thing to help other than IgG. Hyperbaric oxygen would be another. No that is helpful! I think we have found that out as well. He is kind of a health nut, because he has to be. Any other random health things that you keep tabs on? I infuse Gammagard daily. I also take 15 vitamins/supplements daily.

Only mild arm tenderness gone in less than 24 hours. I did not have any side effects with the first two either. Yay!", "Covid and CVID- what to do? My husband was diagnosed with CVID about 3 years ago. He had transfusions for while, but stopped he told me, because \u201cthey did nothing\u201d.  (I am questioning this now, tbh). He had the moderna shot in February, and got an antibody test shortly after that showed he did have antibodies. Yeah! \n\nFast forward to now, he is a schoolteacher and we wanted another antibody test to insure he was ok to go back to work. We got the results yesterday- no antibodies. His Primary care is telling him to get another round of vaccine shots. I have lots of questions though, and am looking for guidance on some topics\u2026 sorry for the long post ! (Right now he has bronchitis - it always starts this way, cough turns to bronchitis, if not watched can go to pneumonia - he is had this happen once. ). \n\nAnyway , his PCPdoesn\u2019t recommend getting another round of shots until he is over the bronchitis so I have a little time to figure things out. But\u2026\n1. He was originally referred to a hematologist/oncologist - now he just sees an oncologist. I am thinking immunologist though. Is this right? I found one but we cannot get in until the end of August. \n2. How much stock can we put in the  antibody test- it seems like there are differing kinds and we need to find that out first. \n3. My concern with getting another round of vaccines is maybe it could overwhelm his system. Thoughts? \n4. Thinking of waiting for immunologist visit before doing anything with more shots- or am i worrying over nothing. ?\nThanks in advance - I was happy to find this group! Hi! I do not have much to add to the vaccine question but will say my immunologist told me to not get the vaccine. I will recommend a few supplements that helped me with pneumonia and bronchitis. NAC, Gaia herbs mighty lungs, vitamin D, zinc, vitamin C. In terms of the infusions, I was on once monthly and would still get infections from time to time. Now I am on weekly subQ infusions with Xembify and have not had an infection since I started last year. May be something to look into. All the best to both of you! Just a little background about myself.\n\nI was diagnosed a little over ten years ago.\n\nI switched over from IVIG to SCIG as it gave me so much more freedom and I find its more effective.\n\nYes, he should have an immunologist, absolutely. CVID is a rare condition, it is effects approx 1 in every 500,000 people and it effects all of us in different ways.\n\nAntibodies tests can are very important as it shows how long a vaccines stays in our system. \n\nNow here comes the complex part. There are many types of vaccines, you have Live, attenuated, Inactivated/Killed, Toxoid (inactivated toxin), Subunit/conjugate and so on. \n\nEach vaccine works in different ways, there are some we can not take, others are not effective and others offer some protection. \n\nIn regards to covid-19 my Immunologist advised to have the Pfizer Vaccine as so far it has shown to give limited protection to people with CVID where as other covid-19 do not due to the type of vaccines they are.\n\nI would recommending waiting to see an immunologist before taking any other vaccine, in the meanwhile I would recommend that your husband take a little bit more care.\n\nSo for example wearing a mask when indoors with lots of people, public transport etc.. \n\nYou have to be careful as there are people with CVID who do not run a fever when they have an infection which is bad as a fever is way the body protecting itself. Hi! I was diagnosed with CVID about 10 years ago, and I do not get IVIG or SCIG. My numbers are very low, but I am lucky to not have frequent infections or illnesses. When I do get sick, it goes from 0 to 100 quickly and hangs around longer than \u201cnormal.\u201d I always get a fever really early, and I always get on antibiotics right away to help mitigate super serious consequences (for me, a cough will often turn to pneumonia / bronchitis - similar to your husband). So, there may be something valid about your husband\u2019s decision to no longer get IVIG. However, I hope it was a decision made in consultation with a doctor. \n\nMy doctor is a hematologist, as I also have a blood related auto-immune disease. It can be common for those of us with CVID to develop auto-immune diseases. I have felt comfortable with this person treating both issues, but I think we are our own best advocates. If you are not satisfied with your current care, you should seek alternate opinions.\n\nWith vaccines in general, I do not have a strong) or any antibody response - depending on the vaccine. However, my doctor encourages me to get the flu shot, the pneumonia vaccine, and the COVID vaccine (basically, as long as it is not a live virus vaccine, I am good). The thought process is that some response is better than nothing. \n\nIt is my understanding that there is not a valid test that has the ability to determine whether the vaccine was \u201csuccessful\u201d for you, particularly for patients with CVID. The antibody tests available are testing whether someone has had COVID, which (to my understanding) is different. \n\nI wonder if the disconnect is talking to a primary care provider vs a specialist? I think I would wait to speak to the immunologist, particularly as it will only be a few weeks.\n\nWhile I am technically vaccinated, I act as if I am not. I wear my mask in public and practice social distancing. I am very limited on where I will go / what I will do, particularly given the delta variant. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to follow up if you have more questions! Thanks for all this, very interesting! I am not familiar this SCIG so will have to check into that. Lots of good notes here for me to ask dr\u2019s. That is REALLY interesting about Pfizer! Edit: you know, I just remembered , back when all this started, the hematologist did ask my husband if he was getting lots of infections, was not, so he said probably ok to not have infusions, and it seems yu and my husband have similar symptoms and the way things progress. Hmnnn\u2026. Interesting about your not getting the infusions\u2026 maybe I have to give my husband a break!! \ud83d\ude01 my husband has not done too bad with infections really, now that you mention it. Your doctors response was similar to the advice given my husband, why not. I never thought of the live virus issue, that is really cool of you to mention. I will remember that! Thanks for your response! Thanks for the info, that is interesting about Xemify\u2026 also the vitamins and supplements , I will look into those. I take D, C, as well. It is a tricky one when to start Infusions.\n\nI went quite a few years before I started.\n\nFor me its was chest infections. It would start with a small cough that would turn into a persistent cough then would then develop into a LTRI.\n\nThe problem is that these infections start damage your lungs bit by bit.\n\nWhat did it for me is that I went a full year with having constant LTRI and the decision was made to start me on IVIG.\n\nI have not had a chest infection since.\n\nSCIG is where instead of having the infusions in your vain, it is under your skin. This mean you can do it at home.\n\nWhere as IVIG is usually done on a month by month basis SCIG is done on a weekly basis which means you have less ups and downs.\n\nUltimately your immunologist will make a decision regarding treatment on your husband IgG levels. Thanks, good information , especially SCIG! I have CVID, diagnosed 23 years ago. Please make your husband see an immunologist. I spend years in oncology and they could not figure stuff out. My treatment went the right way as soon as I say an immunologist. \nWhat kind of transfusion was he getting? I highly suggest to continue them, how could he tell they were not doing anything for him? Even if it is a normal blood transfusion he could still be getting antibodies and other things his body lacks. \n\nMy doc def. recommends a third dose of the vaccine (will hopefully get mine soon, I had no antibodies after the first two shots). For this an immunologist might the the right one to talk to as well :)\n\nThere definitely can check it your body creates antibodies through the vaccines via blood test. \n\nEDIT: some further info on me, I have been having infections of all kinds, mostly chest, before I started IVIG. They almost completely stopped when on infusion. I switched to sub IVIG which is so much more convenient and has even better results (levels stay same and are not dropping, no side effects of the IVIG). I hope you can figure something out and feel free to message me if you have any questions! thanks so much! I do not think the question is how much stock can we put in the antibody testing... titers are very common and have been reliable for many years. The question is how can we trust the vaccine to do its job on people who has deficient immune systems? Do we really just want to keep getting booster shots until it is shows antibodies and then wait until there are no antibodies and repeat that process... for how long? Man, I always struggle with this as well.. I always feel like shat after my sub q and then question if it is just making me worse.. then I stop and feel terrible and im like okay maybe I do need infusions..

So, I was diagnosed about 7 months ago, at which point here in NZ we were COVID free, so mostly it was positive to be diagnosed because it gave me answers and a way forward. But since then the delta variant has gotten out into the community and will only get worse. We have been in lockdown since August, so I have not had to really confront how terrified of all this i am, because I have only been able to interact with my family bubble, in my comfort zone, and everyone around me is aware, and considerate of my condition. \n\nStarting next Friday, a whole heap of restrictions will drop, and vaccinated people will have a fair degree of freedom in terms of gatherings, no longer having to stick to family bubbles etc. This means everyone will start to gather and stop being so careful, including my family and friends, and there will be more cases in the community with access to more areas. \n\nI am freaking out, what do I do? How do I see people? My poor wife is stuck with whatever my comfort level is, and I feel horrible for being scared to associate with anyone because it isolates her as well, but now I cannot trust that anyone has been taking the level of precaution that I would require as an immunocompromised person. \n\nBecause we were basically COVID free this whole time, and now we have it rampant in the community and are about to start opening up, I feel as though I have been plunged from safety, straight into danger. \n\nWhat are your experiences?

Can you get your vaccines and the flu shot while actively getting IVIG? My immunologist says to get it and I have gotten it with no issues.  Hey, why have an immune system if you are not going to use it. My immunologist has also recommended getting it. I got it last year with no issues and I did not get the flu! As an aside, ask your immunologist if you qualify for the double flu shot and if that is a good idea for you. I have a different take on vaccines. I do not take them at all. Never. I had a severe reaction to rubella shot as a child. Since then no vaccines; they make me sick. I even refused the CVID pneumonia vaccines to complete the diagnosis. I finally did after doc explained that my numbers were so profoundly low, there a no chance I would make protective antibodies. He said my numbers were so low (0s) that it was as if I would never had any contact whatsoever with anyone who ever had pneumonia. That is ridiculous, I spent 25 years working with poor people who are more likely to have untreated infections. So, I had the vaccine and it actually lowered whatever minimal protection I had.\n\nFor flu shots I know two things: the vaccine is only good for last years flu. It will not do anything for whatever flu shows up this year. Second, one of them is a live vaccine. I was advised that anyone blood relative to me should never, ever,have any live vaccines. \n\nJust my experience-hope it is food for thought. . . . I have had all of my vaccines up to this point. I am due for a flu shot, a booster, and I have been strongly encouraged by school and my employer to get the hepatitis B vaccines due to my career path. I am normally not one to get flu shots, normally I get the flu on the flu shot however Its mandatory for school unless otherwise stated by a physician I cannot have it. I do believe in having all my other vaccines. I just have read that it is not safe getting vaccines while receiving IVIG due to the stress on the immune system and the body rejecting the vaccine.  I have yet to ask my physician on this. I, too, am one that my IGG levels where non existent. When we discovered the diagnosis my IGG level was at 0. My sister is currently in hospital due to pneumonia...she is CVID. She knows that typically vaccines are not effective on immune suppressed people since antibodies not generated....but I see you mention a CVID pneumonia vaccine? Quick google did not show results..could you explain? Thanks.\n\nBTW I just posted elsewhere asking whether a CVID patient who is currently on Gamma Globulin would have an effect from a vaccine (generate immunity) due to the boost in immunity it provides. No answers yet. Hi, all\nI hope your sister is doing well. The mention of the pneumonia vaccines was likely a reference to the diagnostic process. For the diagnosis to be accurate, the body is injected with pneumonia vaccines to see if there is any reaction, like a build up of the antibodies, which are polysaccharides and would provide protection against lung infection infections.After I had that vaccine my immunity counts decreased. My immunologist commented that it as if I have never met a person who had pneumonia. Given my work in confined institutions with poor people, I doubt I have never met anyone who ever had it. It is not clear why I am still alive, immunology did not figure it out either\u2014file note: \u201dShe is getting protection from somewhere.\u201d.\nP\nO Thank you. Parallels with my sister. She was rn in pediatric icu and was constantly sick, so they tested her.  Never built up immunity, just infections for 30 years. \n\nHer doc flat out said pneumonia vaccine would not work on her.

My husband has lung damage from CVID and I was wondering if anyone has any therapies or treatments that they have used or know about to regenerate and heal the damaged tissue? I know Stem cell therapy is a thing but is not FDA approved. Interested in your thoughts! Ivig? I also have lung damage from CVID - I have an interstitial lung disease. My doctor has me on a daily dose of imuran, and, when I was first diagnosed, I had one treatment of rituxan in the infusion clinic. I do not think either really helped me get lung function back because of scarring. But, it did clear out some abnormal cell growth, and my lung function has been stable since then (nearly 10 years). I was experiencing frequent pneumonias and bronchiectasis before starting prophylactic azithromycin about 10 years ago.  My lungs have improved since then.  I agree with u/Throwaway071521 to be on the lookout for ILD as it is seen in CVID patients.", "20 antibiotics since April BUT normal (borderline) pneumoVax23 titers?! HELP! \n36/male. \n\nAt the end of 2019, I was sent to a pulmonologist due to a incidental finding during a ct of my spine (they thought I might have cancer in my lungs). No cancer. But the doctor was intrigued. I had much scar tissue and some glass like opacities but my lung function was great. He actually cleared me of asthma too. All my life I thought I had asthma because in the 80s, an emergency room doctor told my mom I did. I only had asthma like issues during infections but the problem was, I would get infections about once every 6 weeks (starting at about age 30). No doctor had ever cared to dig. He told me he would dig until he found out why I was sick so often and eventually came up with something on a immunoglobulin lab. He said it all made sense with the fibrosis and frequent infections. \n\nI was sent to a immunologist. Immunologist administered the pnumovax 23 and measured my response 4 weeks later. He showed me on paper why I was not considered immunodeficient and he told me \u201clet us just watch this for now, no treatment is recommended but maybe get a antibiotic when you start getting sick\u201d.... I was ok with that... at the time... I wish I would have dug because since then, I found that the vax23 titer assessment is not fool proof and it is actually widely rejected by some immunologist. If I would have received immunoglobulin therapy, it really makes me livid thinking that I could have had a better reaction compared to the near death to  agony I endured and my current handicapped status with a host of illnesses that leave me pretty much bed ridden every day. Enough of my rant, sorry. \n\nSo my question to you is, have any of you had this same situation? I have read that the doctor is supposed to take clinical evidence in as a factor (like me having had 20+ antibiotics and a lingering atypical inflammation/infection in my lung since April)I have a telephone appointment with him Monday, any advice on how I can get him to reconsider his stance without sounding like a know it all want to-be-doc that so many doctors these days despise? I could always get a new immunologist but I would be setting myself back about a month or 3 being that theres a pandemic and I have an HMO. I would really like to get the ball rolling on immunoglobulin replacement therapy before the next infection takes my life. Not trying to be dramatic but it is pretty severe as I was just in the hospital for a darn bladder infection that spiraled out of control. I feel like I am walking on eggshells everyday. No one responded to this yet. The pneumovax 23 specifically checks response to bacteria not viruses. That said, it is uncommon for someone with CVID to have a good bacterial response. He could be right and another part of your immune system could be malfunctioning. Have your T cells checked too.", "IVIG with COVID-19 antibodies I have Common Variable Immune Deficiency, complicated by bronchiectasis.  I am high-risk for complications from COVID-19.  I get IVIG every four weeks.  My entire family has been in isolation from society for the pandemic since February 2020 because of me, still with no end in sight.  It has been heart-wrenching.  I have received two doses of the Pfizer and one dose of the Johnson and Johnson, but produced no antibodies.  I found out recently from someone in the IVIG-manufacturing industry that now many of the IVIG / subQ IG products that are being produced contain protective levels of antibodies to COVID-19, but the companies will not release these products to their patients, because they still have a year's worth of inventory that they have to use up first.  Does anybody else know about this?  Is there anything that we as patients can do to require the manufacturers to start supplying us with the IVIG that could possibly save our lives from COVID-19?  I cannot bear to wait another year for antibodies when our country has reopened and my workplace is trying to force me to return in person and my children's schools are trying to force them to return in person.  It is not safe out there for my family, because I have no protection.  I just cannot believe that the companies can sit on their live-saving supply and not give it to their own patients who desperately need it.  Does anybody have any advice on what to do?  I really need some help. I have no answer for you, but I have CVID and when I got covid in January, 80 percent of my symptoms went away within hours of doing SCIG.  We are all different and in no way is my experience is yours, but the IG was still incredibly beneficial even without the antibodies. My story is just like yours, except I infuse weekly. I got the Moderns two vaccine protocol. I wanted to check my antibodies and my Dr. refused to order the test. He was afraid the results, not being perfect, could give me a false sense of security or worry. I imagine, like you that I do not have antibodies. My husband and I were in house for 18 months. I am a teacher and I taught from home for a full year 20-21, and last semester 19-20. My school is ending online school. I have to return to the classroom in 3 weeks. I am SO scared! I am not old enough to retire, and I need the job for all my meds. Oh man sorry about your bronchiectasis. I have CVID, do not do infusions, have not been vaccinated and have been fully living my life this whole time. Just keep infusing, you will be ok. It will not kill you. Live your life. My husband has CVID. He got moderna and did have antibodies when tested at that time (February). He is to get another round of vaccine per his PCP and specialist. I guess we really  are all different ! Based on recent presentations at the Immune Deficiency Foundation event, I believe there will COVID antibodies in our IVIG/SCIG by the end of the year.  Please stay positive and hope for the best. I would also encourage you to look for an Immune Deficiency Foundation Get Connected Group which are meeting monthly (virtual):  (  These are great places to share experiences with others who are going through exactly what you are going through.  I co-moderate one for Houston and we have people join us from other parts of the U.S. Yes, thanks, I do watch the Immune Deficiency Foundation events, and I saw the one that said that our IVIG should have a protective level of immunity by July.  But it is July, and I still have no antibodies.  Then I found out from someone in the IVIG industry that the lots that they are producing now do have a protective level of antibodies, but they are sitting in warehouses while they use up their old stock of IVIG for another year.  I do not know what to do. I found this paper interesting.  It appears to be the most compelling evidence to date on your  specific topic though I cannot find anybody hypothesizing on vendors withholding IGG: (\n\nIf you have the time, the July 15th IDF Update by Kate Sullivan is excellent and covers many of your concerns with the latest news.\n\n(\n\nWoody Yes, the paper was presented at the IDF conference by Dr. Manish Butte on 6/23/21 at 4-5pm EDT: \u201cWhen will IVIG have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in it?  Use of hyper-immune serum or anti-COVID monoclonals to bridge the gap until we have IVIG with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in it.\u201d\n\nI did watch the update from Dr. Sullivan, as well as all of her updates.\n\nBut my problem remains that my entire family is still in isolation under doctor's orders because I have no antibodies and I am high-risk due to bronchiectasis.  My workplace is trying to force me to return, and my kids' schools want them to come in person even though they can bring the virus home to me.  And the one product that could protect me, the IVIG with COVID-19 antibodies, will sit on a shelf for another year while I watch my life fall apart.  Is not there anything that can be done? \\\n\nI love that you keep up with all of this.  It is really rare to find and shows how seriously you take this topic.  Here is the rawest of truths.  These decisions about when to relax your isolation are yours.\n\nHere is my situation and maybe you will find parallels and maybe not. I find great hope from the general evidence that CVID COVID patients are not experiencing worse outcomes than those of similar age with similar conditions.  My children are both at home.  My approach to risk: I will only let vaccinated people into my house. I do meet up routinely with other adults that are vaccinated at their houses.  We do not wear masks and we are around a table talking or playing a board game. I will not eat inside at restaurants.  I play tennis once per week mostly in a cavernous indoor facility with other people some of whom I do not know their vaccination status.  I keep my distance from them. I do virtual exercise classes with human instructors.  I have a once/month session with other CVID patients through the IDF Get Connected program. I work from home. So why am I willing to accept some risk.... 1. CVID is unpredictable even without COVID.  Pre COVID 2019 was the worst health year of my life. Isolation and good doctors helped me recover from that.  We can get really sick from the wimpiest bacteria known to humanity.  I have done ok with viruses.  So, the way I sleep at night and accept my risk level is this... I believe that I will know if I have COVID.  I believe I will get tested.  I believe that if that test is positive I can get access to monoclonal antibodies in short order.  I believe monoclonal antibodies are in fact really key to our recovery.  By the way, you may have seen the FDA today extended support of monoclonal antibodies to people who have verified exposure to someone with COVID.  This is great news.  Second, I do believe that my vaccinated T-Cells and my SCIG provide extra help.  Lastly, I know for a fact that I have amazing doctors who will do anything to help me.  Does this mean I will win if I get COVID.  Not hardly.  I am not taunting COVID and I do not want long COVID.  I just think I have a chance if I can act quickly to get treated.  Finally, finally I do think at some point our IGG supply with help us.\n\nI am not suggesting you adopt my outlook but thought I would tell you what is in my head on this topic. Okay, thanks.  But I cannot break isolation until my immunologist says it is safe.  I have been trying for months to get monoclonal antibodies as a preventive through the FDA expanded access program.  But I have not been successful.  Yes, I did see that the FDA is now allowing close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case to get monoclonal antibodies, and my immunologist believes that she could get me signed up for that right away if it happened.   \n But my goal is never to be in that boat.  The risks are way too high. Why would you give someone that advice? You have no idea what the OP's situation is, although she said her doctor recommends not going out! You think everyone with CVID is the same?? Also, you have CVID and you wont get vaccinated- you are part of the problem with CVID folks- the more people vaccinated, the less risky it is for CVID patients to go out. So, thanks for nothing.", "History Indiana ", "Recent FDA rule changes related to Monoclonal antibodies This is really important for those of us in the CVID community to know.  The FDA has expanded the Emergency Use Authorization for Regeneron monoclonal antibodies.  The change is to allow people to take Regeneron after exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID and does NOT require you to have tested positive yet.  The monoclonal antibodies are most useful early. ( Interesting , thanks for posting ! This is a great community! Very good news!  MY husbands dr just called and is looking into this for him! I hope it works out. Did your husband get it? I am thinking about telling my dad about it Not yet. We have an appointment with his specialist later this month.

One of my immunologists specifically recommended LabCorp 164055 and the Johns Hopkins study (vaccineresponse.org) appears to be using LabCorp 164090.  In addition, I found a Twitter thread that says both of these tests look for the spike protein.   I am not sure how many people here have access to Lab Corp but I thought these might be helpful.

I thought I was okay on Monday until the random nausea started, then on Tuesday the headache and fever started too. By Thursday my fever was hitting 101 F and only dropping after taking Tylenol every 4 hours. I talked to my PCP this morning and she sent me for a Covid test just in case and I will be doing some blood work to check for infection. Typically, I would just chalk it up to side effects but it is very rare that I get a fever because of CVID. I did not even get a fever when I had MRSA. Anyone else? Or any thoughts? TIA!! Nothing after the first shot, but I was VERY sick the day after the second one, so much so that we were not certain that it was from the vaccine. Lasted about 3-4 days. Felt like I had influenza. By the way, I also rarely get fevers, and I had one after the second shot about 100. FYI that I have found over the years that I generally only get a fever with a viral infection; very unlikely to get one with a bacterial infection. I wonder if your experience is the same.

She has vitiligo, which is thought to be an autoimmune issue, which I know can raise her chances of other autoimmune issues. She has PCOS, and was overweight her entire life up until she a few years ago at age 54, when she heard from her doctor that she was prediabetic and drastically lost weight. To lose the weight, she severely underate due to a lack of education and guidance from her doctor, who only told her to eat 150g carbs per day or else, and did not mention anything about filling in calories from other food groups, so my mom pretty much ate 1000ish-1300ish calories per day (she works out 4x a week and was 5'7, 200ish pounds to start) and has been for the past 3 years now and she lost 65 pounds. The doctors were concerned about her bodyfat levels before her immune system began to act up, but I was just wondering, could the weight loss and undereating have triggered CVID? Now, she suffers from leg swelling due to low albumin and loss of gastric folds, ulcers, and stomach discomfort from eating not even a reasonable portion of food. I am sorry about your mom. I hope she is able to find good treatment for her symptoms.\n\nCVID is a primary immune deficiency, which by definition are genetic conditions. So if your mom has CVID, she was born with it.

After being treated with some antibiotics and steroids, I got sick only about every other week last year. Three years ago, I was sick very often but did not really put together how much it was impacting my life. I also get infections on my face easily from unhealed pimples. I get weird fluid running through my neck/nose/ears/sinuses I guess. It feels sometimes like i am suffocating. I of course have looked into allergies, autoimmune diseases, etc. An immunologist seems to be testing me for CVID, according to the receptionist, but he did not tell me so himself. I also seem to be losing hair kind of fast, I did accutane twice and still get acne and rashes, I cannot even use eczema-approved, zinc, baby sunscreen because my skin will not tolerate it--I will break out in a rash. I also have neck and back pain often. The neck pain is the worst. I have considered lyme of course, but the western blot came back negative. I have been told bartonella might be the problem given my past exposure to fleas, but I cannot find a test for that. I also am frequently bitten by bugs, which is why I considered lyme. I guess CVID makes sense if the ear infections thing is real. As a kid, I got ear infections nonstop. Then they decreased as I got older, but they still get plugged when I am sick. Starting at about age 20 I began getting sick nonstop. All sorts of things: year long coughs, throwing up, colds, sinus things, colds, flus, strep, etc. I also have insane muscle weakness. Some of these things sound not CVID related to me, though. Like muscle weakness that is ongoing? Is that really a symptom? Are there ongoing symptoms for when you are not sick? Or am I just lowkey getting sick, and my muscles begin to be weak even before I identify that the most recent sore throat is of course new sickness. Any help is much appreciated. I am at a loss. I am also an athlete trying SO hard to keep doing her sport at a preprofessional level. I do not want to quit, but I am about to. I had the wackiest symptoms that no one could figure out and it turned out to be cvid plus some black mold, which o likely had difficulty with due to a lack of an immune system.  To get tested, you get a vaccine and then come back in a month to do blood work, which will show if you bloody made antibodies or not.  No antibodies, then it is cvid. If you are getting recurrent infections then it is possible. What I have personally found is that there are so many things that can be explained by CVID that you would never know about unless you have a diagnosis. Just ask your doctor to do a blood test for your Immunoglobulin levels, particular IGA, IGG &amp; IGM. If they are all low or undetectable then that is a clear sign. I have undetectable IGA, low IGM and lower still IGG. So I get IVIG monthly. The immunologist had me tested for tetanus, pneumococcal, and diphtheria. I did not produce antibodies or titers or something for the pneumococcal..? So I got the vaccine, waited 8 weeks, and they took a blood sample again two days ago. I am nervous for the results because it would mean so much to me to have an answer and receive some sort of validation for all of my struggles :'( Do you know the likelihood that I have CVID given the scenario I have described? Like if they had to have me get a vaccine and then measure my blood's response, does that sound like I probably have a CVID, or does that sound just normal?\n\nAlso, is treatment effective? Like, would I maybe stop losing my hair and finding red bumps all over my face and getting sick all the time and not being able to participate in my sport (due to muscle weakness)? And does life expectancy look normal? Is treatment for the rest of your life? This is interesting because I looked into mold. How did you figure out you had mold? I wonder if the same thing is happening to me: difficulty with any amount of mold due to a weak immune system. I just got tested after 8 weeks to see if my body made antibodies. I honestly hope I get some answers. Despite the use of the word \"common\" it is a pretty rare condition. Estimated to be somewhere between 1 in 25,000 and 1 in 50,000.\n\nI could not tell you what the likely hood is based on your symptoms and I would not want to as I am not an immunologist, just someone with CVID and my experience is my own. It does not mean that if you have CVID that we would experience the condition in the same way.\n\nI would try and look it in a positive way. For me, it took me years to figure out what was going on and I saw so many different types of specialists, so getting a diagnosis was a great thing for me. It gave me some validation and something to put a label on what serious problems I would been having.\n\nWhile I still get sick far more than the average person, I would call the treatment life-changing. Thanks for your reply. I guess I am not asking if it sounds like CVID based on physical symptoms. I am asking if not producing the antibodies for one of the things they exposed me to signifies the possibility of CVID. The reason I ask is because the receptionist told me this is what they were testing me for, but the immunologist himself has yet to communicate with me about what these tests are really for. It sounds like the process I have been through is how they test for CVID but I am unsure, so I am wondering if it sounds like that is what they are testing me for. I wish the immunologist would talk to me directly so I know whether or not to move on and try a new specialist. I figure they are working on something if they had me go back to the lab after 8 weeks to get another blood sample. I also am thinking I did not produce antibodies to only one of the things to which they exposed me. Come to think of it, though, this might have nothing to do with how many immunoglobulins I am missing or whatever because maybe he was actually testing for tetanus and stuff, not CVID, and that is when my inability to fight off pneumococcal alerted him to the possibility of CVID. I guess none of it matters though because they should be calling me about results in a couple of days. \n\nI guess my symptomatic questions were not too productive because we would experience it differently, if I had it. And I easily could have something else. I was just hoping it would solve many of the independent problems I have to manage every day. Like really low vitamin D, really low Vitamin B12, weird hormones, rashes and acne that are not treat-able and seem to get infected easily but never heal, even with antibiotics, sporadic muscle weakness, on top of always getting sick. I know your symptoms differ from mine. I guess I am just expressing my hope that I have found an answer at last, and that my body will not be so high maintenance any more. It is so bad, it takes me like hours to get ready for bed because of all the medications, vitamins, probiotics, and other pills I have to take, in addition to face ointments, conditioner to keep my hair in the best I can, special toothpaste for my weak enamel etc. I also have OCD, it seems, so perhaps I am  hyper-focussed on these things, but when any of them temporarily resolve themselves, I am extremely content. I do not think it is 100% OCD. Also, my mental health has become very complicated. I know it is easy to blame my complicated mental health for the decline in my physical health, but I swear it is a byproduct of my physical health and I have been targeting the wrong thing. Urine testing from Great Plains lab, as well as blood markers consistent with mold issues, but the mycotoxin testing is a must It was not until I got Shingles on my face at 29 just after I  developed Dermatomyositis  they realized something was very wrong. I was always sick and it is been traced back to my first deployment 10 years ago but it took forever to get there. The Autoimmune Bullshit was diagnosed before the CVID bc it was what tipped them\noff to the CVID. They did not even realize I would had Shingles twice before the time after they took my immunodeficiency into account. One time they went with cellulitis and another an allergic reaction of some sort?\n\n. It is a weird disease and getting the tests done is half the battle but then hopefully treatment will work. Somehow I am allergic to IVIG so we are working on it. The Autoimmune stuff def muddied the waters tho. I hope that you get a diagnosis and if it is a treatable form of CVID you are about to experience a major step up in your quality of life. Personally I was not especially prone to illness but I had a similar experience with my skin (Accutane torture treatment x 2, still have breakouts and scaly scalp but BiD antibiotics and rx-strength ketaconozole have helped). I was not diagnosed until after I nearly died twice and the life-saving operations have made my life since the second one so painful, difficult and traumatic that I would not wish it on anybody but I sure would have been a lot better off if the doctors had correctly diagnosed me the first time I had it. All I can say is if your doctor does not have a diagnosis for you, go further up the ladder until you find someone that does. In my experience young doctors tend to be overly confident and with far less experience to base their confidence upon. I am sympathetic to the difficulty of that situation but increasingly I have learned that it is in the best interest of everyone involved for ambiguity to be pushed into the view of someone that has seen much more and been a long term part of their patient\u2019s life so they can appreciate the implications for better and worse. One of the best things to come from my diagnosis is that my mom, who would been having severe sinus infections and was about to undergo her 4th operation to remove her completely obstructed sinus when it was suggested that she be tested for it and although the genetic link is not well understood it was enough reason for the harmless test and at the age of 62 she was diagnosed and started treatment for CVID too. Her sinus infections resolved completely without any more surgery and for the first time in several decades she regained her sense of smell. Neither of us would have been described as being in poor health but I was dangerously skinny, at 6\u2019 I weighed 113lbs when I was admitted to the hospital and I was unable to gain any emergency reserves until I started doing infusions. Now I am more proportionally thin and not unhealthy looking, my muscles filled in a more masculine form and my health is a very predictable and consistent pattern, I do not want to get into my details here because this is about you but if you want to know more feel free to message me and I can tell you anything and everything that I have experienced in the nearing a decade since then. Get well. Hi there - if it is not too personal, can I ask how you almost died twice? I am writing an answer to your question, but it is a long story even in the most abbreviated form. I really ought to put it online somewhere so that I can just point people to the address rather than retelling it, so I just wanted you to know that I am not ignoring you, and it is not too personal, it is just the story of my life so I guess depending on how you define it is either the most personal thing or not at all but regardless I do not have anything to be ashamed of. I have been extremely lucky in my life but extreme good fortune and extreme bad fortune are omnipresent. I have been embracing the edict that it is better to stand out than to fit in so at least I am not normal.\n\nMore to come...", "CVID and Fatigue Hi all.  I (42M) was diagnosed a year ago, but suspect I have had CVID for at least 7 years.

I empathize with you but the best thing for one may not be applicable to the next as every patient is different. Fatigue at it is least is a common effect with nothing other than rest applicable based on it is severity which can be disabling.  Check out the spoon theory. \n  Advocate with your doctor's as there could be unfound things.  \nStay strong zebra. Have CVID (48M) and fatigue myself . Get your PTH levels checked . I ended up having a tumour on my parathyroid that screwed my hormones . Once removed it was like a new life . Still tired some days , but best I have been in 15 years . Also a male w/CVID diagnosed in early 40s (now late 40s) and also on Hizentra. I experienced what you described for about 2.5-3 years, then emerged from the fatigue+fog. I still get bouts that last 3-5 days every once in a while, but nothing like it was before. Good recommendations here for supplements, tests, etc., and sll worth exploring. I tried them all without any luck. Turns out time is what my body needed. It is probably not too much comfort to read this and think that maybe you have got snother couple years of this, but sharing in case it provides any kind of silver lining. Thank you, it is very helpful to know that it may not be a forever thing.

Seems like it is a pretty promising development.", "3rd Booster- How long to wait until protection? Has anyone had any guidance about how long it takes for the 3rd booster to \"work\". I think with previous shots it was 2 weeks- but havent heard anything now. I spoke to my drs early last week, the said as soon as it is approved get it. Got it Friday evening. I do not know it will work but I got it! Yeah ! I have not seen any guidance for me in California and I have been looking I have heard 2 weeks as well but cannot find a specific source for that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I have a call into my doctor.  But I am wondering why we think this 3rd shot is the charm, if the first two did not do anything. Still, going to get my third shot this week. How do we get on an approved list for this? Will the fact that we were eligible due to health the first time still be on record, and will that be enough to just sign up / show up somewhere like a pharmacy? Also will this really make a difference against delta vs the original shots? Or is it the same unmodified version of the vax from the spring? I got moderna for what it is worth. Thanks!  My husband got moderne originally, he gothic third shit recently. He had a prescription from his doctor, but went local board of health, and they just gave it to him. So, not sure exactly how it is being done nationally. My husband developed some antibodies (so the test said) , so we are hoping this will fill him back up! I heard somewhere that you were not required to show proof of a diagnosis.  I called the local pharmacy (Costco ) where we always get our flu shots to see if they were giving third shots, since I could not get through their tree on the website.  At first they said were not set up for 3rd shots, but she called me right back and said, no, she was wrong and I could get the third shot.  \n\nI went there this morning and I got the third shot right away.  No proof required and I did not even need an appointment.  That seems wild, because when vaccines were first available in our area, you could not find one for love or money.  Every time a friend or family member finally got an appointment, we did a happy dance.\n\nCostco always has you fill out a form with medical problems, so there is a place to state that you are immune compromised. \n\n I also just received a letter from my doctor stating that I was eligible because of a diagnosis of primary immune deficiency.  He stated that I could get either Pfizer or Moderna and that the third dose should be 28 days after the two dose regiment.\n\nSo I suggest you call wherever you are thinking of going to get your vaccine and make sure they have the latest news. I am part of the John\u2019s Hopkins study and I did develop antibodies. They have been measuring me every couple of months. But the IgG was nearly gone 6 months after my second dose. Most vaccines gradually lose effectiveness over time.  Some do not, but for many it is not as simple as one shot and you are finished for the rest of your life.", "So lately I have really been struggling. My symptoms (chronic fatigue, chronic pain, migraines, infections) are flaring and have been for almost two months now. I have started to looses many hours at work and today my boss basically told me I have to be demoted because I cannot make 35 hours a week. I am applying for disability but I have not heard back yet. I also have bipolar disorder which just makes everything so much worse. Does anyone have any kind words, reassurance, or resources on how to deal with this illness. I also just had a port placed for my lifelong IVIG, which is just another thing to accept. I do not know how to think positively right now. I cannot offer reassurance, but I can promise you that you are not alone. There is lots of us all over the world going through flares too right now, all at the same time. Even if we are not reaching out and communicating, we are always sending love to all the other nameless, faceless strangers going through the same thing. And flares are hard, I am recovering from a recent one that did a bit of damage to my heart. The whole thing is scary, and you have every right to be anxious and nervous. Just remember the good things, and maybe you can find something you can do from home that is not so taxing, or is a great creative outlet. I have found that the worst experiences come with the greatest blessings. Last January, I hit black ice and rolled part of the way down the side of a mountain. Luckily, I walked away from that with a minor concussion, the drivers seat was the only intact part of the car. My worst flares have brought new diagnoses and intervention methods, as well as a bigger knowledge of my own body. Fear brought me to this community and others, and I realized how much love and support there is among the CVID community. My point being. Things are absolutely harder and slower moving in life for us, but you are cared about, you are supported, and you are capable. Maybe this is leading into something better for you. Either way, I will keep my fingers crossed for ya! I have a friend who is insurance does not consider his CVID medically necessary as his levels are just a tad too high. He would do anything to be on IVIg- so while being on lifelong therapy seems daunting, you are so incredibly lucky. \n\nI am going to share this with him, he is amazing and insanely knowledgeable. I think you all can help one another. \n\nAs far as your job goes, sounds like they do not deserve you! What state are you in? Have you spoken to an attorney? \n\nYou are so strong for all you are enduring- a mighty warrior! You have got this! You can chat or PM me.  I am  ( buddy that she is talking about. Unfortunately in GA to be considered full time and get benefits you have to work 32 hours or more on average, right now my average hours are around 23 and to make up for that average I would have to work 40 or more hours a week through the rest of the year which is just not physically possible :( Thank you \ud83e\udd7a\u2665\ufe0f Ofc!

From one Anna to another lol", "How often do you get \u201csick\u201d I am wondering how often you get some sort of sick to those with a diagnosis of CVID. Excuse my ignorance, I am hoping to get tested soon. I have had multiple GI and respiratory infections, about no less than 5 a year that knock me on my ass but not severe enough for hospital trips. Just looking for a frame of reference. Thanks for any insight you can provide. I do not and never had GI issues and I am only as sick as the average person with the average cold/flu since beginning the Ig.  Before the Ig, I had sinusitis in every sinus that would not go away.  Fun times. lg? What does that acronym mean? Thanks btw immunoglobulin. It is the treatment for CVID rarely and completely in line with everyone else around me.  No nonstop sinusitis Before IG I felt constantly sick in some way, and had three months of combined bedrest or hospital care, in the year leading up to the diagnosis. Since starting IG about 9 months ago I have been sick twice, and only one of those times required hospitalization. My daughter has been doing subq ig for 4 months now and I have seen a huge improvement in her all around. She still does get sick. Elementary school age child but the duration is a lot shorter and the illness is not as severe. Example: Pre-diagnoses a cough would turn into pneumonia literally within hours. Now with treatment, a cough is just a cough. However, with any fever present, her dr prescribes antibiotics. \nWhen she was diagnose the beginning of January, all of this information was so overwhelming but with the help of subs like this, FB support groups and local support groups, it has made this journey tremendously easier. I hope you get the answers you need and begin to feel a difference.", "I thought I was supposed to feel better. I struggle a lot with the fact that I do not feel better. Since being diagnosed with CVID, it is felt like my life has taken a 360. I understand that if I had not had IVIG for the last year and 8 months that I would have spent so much more time suffering and in the hospital, but the medical trauma I have experienced since being diagnosed and the physical toll this illness has taken on me makes it so hard to see the positives. \n\nI feel exhausted all of the time. I have multiple vitamin deficiencies, am now on b12 injections, and nothing is really working. I am bipolar and it does not help. I have had port surgery, sinus and septum surgery, along with countless other medical procedures and endless doctors appointments. \n\nI just thought things would get better. I feel you.  For myself, it is not so much feeling \"better\" as much as I just am less sick.  I can see when I stop taking my medicine (and I did, insurance issues) after about 9 months I could feel myself just falling apart.  In my mind, the \"sick\" feeling is a slow decline leading to death (pneumonia, infections, etc.) Doing the meds makes me feel better, however I still have fatigue - I still have issues with my eyes - I still have Bronchiectasis which makes my lungs feel awful, however I am not dead!\n\nI wish I could offer more help but at least I can let you know you are not alone, and I offer you internet hugs at least. I stopped my igg and felt better. Still sucks but better than the hell that is iv or sub-q igg. \n\nNot everyone is body can take igg. I feel your pain (and it sounds like we were diagnosed around the same time). Now that doctors know I have this condition, they are on the lookout for issues \u2014 and they keep finding them! Like, I guess it is good they know my liver is enlarged and my platelets are low and whatnot, but they cannot really do anything about it and every finding triggers a battery of tests and appointments. It is annoying as crap and I am sorry. This. This is exactly how I feel, I appreciate you. Knowing I am not really dying gives me a better peace of mind, but this is exhausting and it will never go away. Thank u for hugs \ud83e\udd7a\u2665\ufe0f Getting sick ruined my hormones, triggering massive fatigue, and I did not feel better until I replaced my testosterone. I thought I was the only one...I started it again just recently after years of going off of it, but it never actually seemed to help me and as far as I can tell, it is not helping me now. I still get very sick. And my numbers are very low without it.\n\nI have a bunch of other health problems as well, though, so that does not help. Yea.. I dont know, honestly IVIG made me feel soooo much worse.. and 8 hours in the hospital, screw that.  Im on sub Q now and im literally staring at my treatment as we speak debating whether I want to do it or not cause I know I will feel like crap after.  I know how you feel though this disease sucks so hard, I just try my best to keep goin, its hard bein tired all the time but I drink a lot of caffeine kind of helps.  I have accepted though that life will probably keep getting worse as I get older because of CVID, so I am just going to live how I want to live now while my body can handle it.  I dont want to be an old geezer anyway.", "Probiotic Has anyone found a probiotic that is useful for CVID-induced inflammatory bowel? Currently on inflectra and it is not working great. TIA Do not have that issue. Oxypowder by global world health is what I would try first.  It will loosen your bowels, FYI.  Have you tried rectal ozone? No, never heard of it. I used VSL3 for a while, it is expensive, hard to find and has to be refrigerated but I thought it was helping.  A CVID friend swears by kefir in mass quantities (this same person has had success with the FODMAP diet).  I had no luck with FODMAP diet. Thanks. Someone else recommended VSL3 to me and I was wondering if it was worth the money", "IVIG therapy soreness My mom is 64 and was diagnosed with cvid several weeks ago. She did her first treatment two days ago. This time they put all six syringes in her belly. \n\nOver 48 hours later and she is still VERY tender and sore at the injection sites. Is that normal?  Is there anything you have found helps with the soreness? \n\nOverall not a bad side affect at all. Totally worth it. Just trying to make the process as comfortable for her as possible. Yes, it is tender and will be for a few days.  You are literally filling your fat with many grams of a substance that will take a few days to dissipate.  Its more about the displacement causing the discomfort rather than the substance itself. It is uncomfortable to do exercises that involve running or bouncing for a few days and I stick to riding a bike during that time period.  I have more appreciation for women trying to exercise with implants, because that is what it feels like for me. But it is normal.  I infused on Friday and it is still tender today (mildly) if I press on the site today. After my first few treatments I was pretty sore up until a few days afterwards and then the pain subsided quicker as I did more treatments! I have been doing infusions for half a year and now I am sore only for a day afterwards. For me heat (like a heating pad or warm washcloth) helps with the pain and also helps the medicine dissipate into the body quicker. And of course good old fashioned ibuprofen helps. Overall, you are right it is completely worth it. I hope she feels better soon!! Thanks! Heating pad/wash cloth after the injection? Thanks! I forgot to add that people typically recommend ice for the tenderness.  You could ask for a topical nsaid if it is a significant problem. Yes! I usually wait to see how I feel about an hour or two after and if the site is still tender or I am still sore the next day I find that heat (I use a heating pad) + advil really helps. Good luck! If you have any other qs feel free to PM me it definitely can be overwhelming at first. Yes! I usually wait to see how I feel about an hour or two after and if the site is still tender or I am still sore the next day I find that heat (I use a heating pad) + advil really helps. Good luck! If you have any other qs feel free to PM me it definitely can be overwhelming at first. The first few subcutaneous infusions can leave uncomfortable lumps that last a couple of days. The sites should become acclimated and stop reacting so strongly after a couple of infusions. If she uses new sites, like in the arms, legs or upper buttocks, the new sites could also react until it get acclimated.\n\nAnother thing that causes irritation is if the tubing is primed all the way to the needles. If you insert a needle that has immunoglobulin on it, the skin can become irritated and itchy or painful. It is aggravating, but not harmful. When you prime the tubing, stop a few inches before the needles, air in the tubing is not at all harmful with subcutaneous infusions.   \n\nI hope future infusions are less irritating for your mom. Thank you! That was very helpful.", "Anyone need help or resources? Hello! I am Robyn, a territory care coordinator for an infusion pharmacy specializing in in-home therapy. If anyone needs help, resources or is unhappy with their current provider, I will be happy to assist or give moral support. Stay well friends and reach out to me if you need anything. I have my first appointment for infusion therapy tomorrow, and I was wondering what to expect? I was told to stay well hydrated before the appointment and that I will be given Benadryl and a pain reliever before hand, but not much beyond that. So I was just wondering about the process, if I should take a book to read, etc. Depending on what you are getting, or can take upwards of 4-6. Yours may not be that long.\nDefinitely being a book, some do not allow cell phones because of the light, they like it to be relaxing so people can sleep. All depends on where you go.

How was your infusion?", "T cells suddenly and dramatically dropped below normal I am posting in the faint hope that someone might have gone through something similar and recovered. For background, I am deficient in IgG, IgA, and IgM. I infuse Hizentra weekly and it has helped with my IgG levels.\n\nAnyway, I had a really bad September. My immunologist ordered routine lab work at the end of August, including a lymphocyte panel. She is ordered it in the past and it is always been within normal range. But in early September, she called to tell me that my t-cells (CD3+ and CD8+ for those who know of such things) had gone way down from the last test, in March. One of the few reasons this can happen is lymphoma. She referred me to an oncologist who ran a bunch of blood tests, including a repeat lymphocyte panel. The numbers were worse! Now I had more things below normal range - way below. In fact, my t-cells are so low that I am at risk for an \"opportunistic infection\" -- a particular type of pneumonia, so I am on a long-term antibiotic. The good news is, the other blood work ruled out lymphoma or leukemia. The bad news? No one can figure out what is going on. I am very scared. I have been in a somewhat similar situation.\n\nEvery now and again my lymphocyte count has a dramatic increase even thou I feel fine and nothing untoward has happened.\n\nEach time it is happened it stays at a high level for a few months and then just goes back down of its own accord.\n\nEach time they tested me for cancer amongst many other things and everything always comes back negative.\n\nThey have no idea why this happening, it appears to be something my body does. Much like u/ghostriders, my body freaks out about once every few years and all the cancer bells go off. In the end, it is nothing, everything returns to its normal sub-par self, and no one can figure it out. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Thank you! Sorry to hear about your situation. My white blood cells have been dropping for a while, but in the last year it is gotten much worse. I have had a couple of bone marrow biopsies, so we have been able to rule out cancers, but my neutrophils have been around zero and I have been ending up in the hospital with fevers. At this point all of my blood counts are low to some extent. I have been on G-CSF to bring up my neutrophil count for about 6 weeks now, but it did not do any good until I had remission of my enteropathy and started back my vitamin supplements, about a week and a half ago. Now my neutrophils are 10x the previous low, if still 1/5 of normal.\n\nAll of that to say, if you are having GI issues, it might be worth having your mineral levels checked. B12, folate, copper, and iron can all play a role.\n\nIt could also just be autoimmune, and there is a whole raft of options for that as well. I just know there can be a tendency for specialists to skip over the simple stuff. That is a great point. Honestly, at this point, I think my doctors are willing to entertain just about anything. Sorry to hear about your situation and I hope you are able to heal! This stuff really sucks.", "Infection w/o Fever Hello, I really hope this finds ya\u2019ll well in the midst of all this Bananas Bullshit and does anyone else rarely get fevers in general like even with the more serious or multiple infections?i usually do not but Ive had one for like a month. I think I def have another bladder infection and maybe bronchitis, but its sorta concerning seeing as how I have not had a temp above 99.3 in like three years- not with the Shingles or Pneumonia or Strep or anything else so I am not entirely sure why the heck I have one now. \n\nMy last IVIG was January and I thought maybe the extra immunity meant I had enough for a fever now but it is also been a few months. I dunno, it is not just bc its unusual to be a thing at all but also  the stubbornness and duration.\n\nI really hate going to Civilian Hospitals. It is always a bit uncomfortable even when I bring the relevant medical records theres this nagging in the back of my head they are skeptical. If it is a thing and I should be good I am not going anywhere but also, I seem to be getting worse. \n\nThanks for your help *hugs* Well, fever means your body is battling something. Cannot really tell what is going on without tests.\nMy whole family has CVID/SPAD. One of my kids was making fever all the time. Untill we quit the profylax antibiotics.  Then the months of fever went away. We now think he was fighting against the constant antibiotics given to him. He says he feels much better now (maybe also due to spring). My other kid does not make any fever so we are always extra careful. I sometimes make a fever and sometimes dont. So what the rule of thumb for me is: how do i feel? Do i have energy waking up in the morning? Am I exhausted at 14 of the clock? I learned to listen to my body carefully. Listen and interpret the signals. And in my opinion,  if you think you have an infection in your bladder it should be treated. I once did not recognize this infection on time and got hospitalized because it turned into a kidney infection. When in doubt,  write down the signals and decide to go to the doctor or treat it with the antibiotics you have at home.\nI dont know your IVIG treatment but January the last time is a long time away. Why do not you just call your doctor? I do not always get spectacular fevers for how sick I am. Conversely I developed GPA last year and my temp did not go below 40 for like two months. So I know I can run fevers, it is just not a huge part of having pneumonia or sinusitis or whatever I get a fever of up to 99.9 daily. I was tested for COVID19. Negative. I figure I run a fever daily. I am used to it. I rarely get fevers and have learned from both personal experience and doctors that I should expect that I am more likely to get a fever with viral infection over a bacterial infection. I was also involved in a research study investigating temperature of people with immunodeficiency, so researchers are clearly interested in the correlation.", "I just received a positive COVID-19 test. My immunologist has prescribed ivermectin for me. Has anyone heard of this therapy? The literature sounds promising.  Following. My wife has CVID. She is very worried about catching it.  My wife,  daughter and I have been basically in quarantine since March.  I hope everything goes well! Is your wife under the care of an immunologist? I had great results from ivermectin - I took it for three days, and by the second day of it my symptoms basically stopped progressing and I plateaued for a few days before slowly getting better. It is a scary disease, but I had a much milder course than I expected given my diagnosis. Mind you it was not fun - lots of headaches, shortness of breath, and exhaustion like I have never experienced before. After two weeks my only remaining symptom is fatigue. It never really went into my lungs. I wish you and your family good health and good luck. Thank you! Good to know and I am glad everything went well for you. \n\nI looks like we are going to be forced to move for my job and she is dreading the moving with covid. \n\nShe has an immunologists and does weekly subQ", "Contracting the coronavirus having CVID Like most everyone, I am very concerned about the coronavirus, particularly for those who are immunocompromised. Truthfully though, as someone with CVID, I find myself privately panicked. This is because this virus suddenly and severely attacks the lungs. It is hard for me to not think back over the times I was very sick with lung infections because of CVID. Including a time I almost died. During those lung illnesses, I was helped with antibiotics and high dose steroids. However, this is a virus, and it seems there is nothing that can help us if we contract it. From what I gather, we would struggle to breathe, to the point where in a short period of time, we could die. It is hard to ignore the fact that CVID does not increase the risk for complications to lung infections.These are all enough reasons for us to worry. Personally, I keep thinking about how if something happened to me, it would be traumatic for my family, especially my children...These are my personal thoughts. I would like to know the thoughts of other people within the CVID community. Thank you.  I also have CVID.  I take standard Precautions to keep Safe such as social distancing and washing of hands. I am also taking astragalus and garlic, just supplements that I can throw a little bit more at my immune system for a tiny boost. Obviously the main boost is from the subcutaneous immunoglobulins. But more importantly, you cannot go through life, especially with an illness such as ourselves with fear and trepidation. The excess cortisol does nothing to help our immune system And no matter the outcome, there is no use of burning the wick of our lives with fear and anxiety. I have no idea what the outcome will be for us, but I am going to enjoy my life till the very end, wether next week or three decades from now. Even if it takes my lungs, it is not going to take my brain, my soul, or my spirit. I have also been pretty worried about it, particularly when reading the reports that the CDC expects something like 80% of the population to catch it. \n\nAre you one of the folks who experience lots of bad symptoms even when under treatment? Apparently there are two types of CVID patients, those who are constantly sick and have lots of other issues, and those who are otherwise perfectly healthy but tend to get walking pneumonia/colds a lot when not treated. Luckily I am in the latter group, so I hope that means I will not have a hard time beating this thing if/when I get it. I plan to call my dr on Monday to get more details, find out if low IG levels means I will not be able to easily fight off a nasty lung infection. Unfortunately, I am in the constantly sick group, though IVIG has helped me tremendously! Unfortunately, the antibodies currently in IVIG batches do not include antibodies to the coronavirus. I am not saying that as an expert, it just makes sense to me. This is new to our country, and therefore plasma donors will not have the antibodies yet. Even if so, new IVIG batches have to go through a screening and purifying process. So, I feel good knowing IVIG will hopefully keep my lungs as healthy as possible right now from other causes of infection. Because surely, catching the coronavirus if I am already fighting off anything else is not something I want to imagine... Hopefully you can work from home and isolate yourself for a few months. That is what I am planning to do, with my only outings being the grocery store and target. Hopefully everything will be better 6-12 months from now. I am glad you will hopefully be able to work from home. I will be mostly home, too, and so will my youngest teen. Her school and others in the state are closed. But, she has been around many other kids up until yesterday, and I hate knowing about the silent incubation period. She loves hugs and hanging out close to me (I love that, too!:) \nReally, anyone in my family could be contagious now but not know it. My older two teens work, and so they come into contact with people and then come back home to us. So, it makes me wonder\u2014can parents really ever be isolated from the coronavirus? I can only hope my kids have minimized there contact with others and have used good hygiene but I am not confident. So, yeah, I am worried. That is why I started this post. I do not live my life in worry normally. But with this pandemic now being a national emergency, I wanted to chat with other folks with CVID. When the CDC gave a recent quote of the percentage of deaths as approximately 2%, but THEN quoted that the elderly and immunocompromised have an approximate fatality rate of 15%, I not only worried for myself, but as I said before, for my children. I KNOW they would be very anxious if I start to show symptoms. Or, if one of my children started to become ill, they would worry about passing it to me or that they already had...I think I feel guilty that I am in that approximate 15% group. I know it is not my fault. But I also know what being in that high risk group could potentially mean for my kids. Ahh, that is rough. My son is 17 months, so as long as he is not in daycare we can keep him isolated enough.\n\nFor what it is worth, I think the 15% rate is for people who are SERIOUSLY ill already, folks like my grandma - she is 85 years old, has COPD, lung issues, etc. - those people are almost certain to pass if they get it, so they drive up the numbers. Thank you for saying that. When I think about it, the risks for mortality in our country will become clearer over time. I wish I knew how much the estimate of 15% was based in part on data from other countries. Certainly though, I believe the numbers presented to us now are the best they can give. Great advice for us all! I will try harder to keep calm for all of those very good reasons! I really do believe in the power of the body-mind relationship. I will admit, however, that I would be better at staying calm if I did not live within a family unit who struggles to stay calm. We honestly try to live life as \u201cnormally\u201d as possible. To the extent of seeing therapists at times to help us cope with the stress of multiple medical dramas that both my children and I have had. It is been a lot over the years, but good progress finally happened over the past year. I should not worry that a major setback is possible within my family. That sounds silly to say, but I know it is true. Faith, hope, trust I am worried for my partner who has CVID. We have one of our own and two foster g Co life with that have contact with their parents 3x a week. My partner is also a teacher. Schools are not going to close. I do not know what I would do without him. As someone who was recently diagnosed and feeling very apprehensive about the whole situation, this was encouraging to read. I have also been trying to maintain a level of calm, knowing there is only so much I can do. Thank you. I actually joined to see what opinions were, diagnosed 21 years ago but been sick as long as I can remember, although it is scary I have got to the stage of thinking what germ of the week am I going to get this time, I have basically done most of what people have been told to do for a long time, social distancing if I can keeping things hygienic (I have plenty of hospital grade hand sanitiser that would make me a small fortune on the black market \ud83d\ude05), and try to stock stuff in advance incase I am sick.\nFor me this is my usual week, nothing has changed because of the virus, though the panic buying and restrictions is the hardest hitting especially if you are easily fatigued, thankfully have good friends who got a few things for me (not all hero\u2019s wear capes!)\n\nIf I am honest I think I might of picked it up, had streaming nose sneezing cough and I just had to keep warm let myself sweat out the fever and just hope it did not hit my lungs, though a little bit of chest infection, but other than that I feel on the mend (I have been a lot worse)\n\nSo yeah, do not panic, you were trained for this, obviously if it hits your lungs and worry it might turn to pneumonia then get yourself checked, but you can battle it. Absolutely, the fatigue is awful. Makes the smallest tasks a monumental accomplishment, although there are marginally better days. Those who can help source supplies are a massive help indeed.\n\nGlad to hear you are on the mend, that is very positive. I also have something simmering, not sure if it is covid19 though. Just been isolating myself. However, I am feeling like I might need an antibiotic now for my chest. Not keen on having to go out to the doctor and potentially exposing myself. \n\nThank you for your kind words, I will focus on each day as it comes. All the best to you and everyone else too. Stay safe. I am a 33 F and I was diagnosed with CVID last April and have been doing SCIG ever since. I am scared shitless over COVID 19. I normally just have chronic sinus and GI issues. Only had pneumonia once and have had sports induced asthma when I was a kid. I have been overly cautious with hand washing, isolation, etc and I still feel like I am going to get it. God help us all. Just hope the SCIG does its job and protects me.  Wish I could get some reassurance but so far, none. I am scared too. I have CVID, and lesions in my lungs which has caused my lung function to be quite poor compared to the average person. So basically I feel doomed if I contract the Corona Virus.\nI live with my fianc\u00e9, and I have to make sure he stays safe for not only himself but for me too, because he could easily catch, carry and pass on the virus to me. \nI have had to beg him to not travel into the city for work :-/\nI just want the CV to be controlled so I can get rid of all this anxiety. how can we not share in your anxiety? the medicine we receive that contains pooled antibodies does not contain antibodies to covid-19. but, let us be grateful we are getting treated with an infusion of so many other antibodies, which increases our odds of being healthy during this time. this comforts me some. knowing that without the CVID diagnosis and treatment, i would be at increased risk of being sick with something else during this terrible time. if that were the case, i feel that my body might not survive an infection with covid-19 for sure!\nso, i am right there with you. washing my hands so much, which normally would seem OCD. but not now because things have changed. actually, it is the constant change that is happening, and the fear of the unknown that further fuels anxiety. \ni am glad i started this post. it has been nice to share my thoughts and feelings, as well as to hear the same from others with CVID. i feel sort of alone amongst my family and friends, who are certainly worried right now, but not to the degree i am. because like i said before, i have been very sick before with lung infections, but i was saved by antibiotics. so getting a lung targeting virus that would not be helped by an antibiotic, during a time when hospitals are overflowing,well...it scares me enough to want a support group you think you might have picked up covid-19?!? \ni think you are supposed to call your doctor for your health\u2019s sake, and for the sake of your city and state that have to monitor the numbers of people contagious with the virus in this pandemic, and also to see what kind of quarantine you would need from others\u2014you will be contagious for weeks! \nalso, i was not trained for this, and whether or not i panic will depend on whether it hits hard and fast and i cannot breathe! omg i cannot imagine! being on a ventilator hoping i will make it through...my kids panicking about me...this is truly scary for those that are immunocompromised and have preexisting lung conditions\u2014covid-19 impacts your lungs hard and fast! some people can handle it. but unlike SARS, this virus does not have to turn into pneumonia for it to get really life threatening i am right there with you in how you feel!\ni hope all stays well with you, your family, and ofc i hope this for everyone in this chat group:) I had written a long reply...then got wiped after a phone call..\n\nI do agree with you on everything it is very scary and trying to keep away from people is hard and stressful especially loved ones, I myself have bad lungs from years of infections and feel like I have been running when all I have done is gone up the stairs, so avoiding any social areas such as public transport or even crowds is a constant battle (I think I got Ill from a packed bus when looking after the kids), and although there is a lockdown here (uk) people are still panic buying and ignoring advice. Thankfully I feel a lot better now but I do intend to stay home and not see anyone though I do get my meds next week sent to me, and it is tough to tell people to stay away.\n\nOne thing people forget about cvid is the stress and depression it can cause, I was going to see a psychiatrist over it as I did suffer from panic attacks, and of course that in itself can make you unwell, so why I tried to put a positive post above, my mum had the condition and died when I was a teen (and I am now older than her then when she died, which does put a lot in perspective)\nAll you can do in times like this is stick to what you know and be stubborn and say no to anything that puts you at risk even if it is a hard choice. I agree with everything you said. Thank you for sharing your story. I hope you stay well. Keep us posted. It is nice to have this group chat forum for those that understand. Well. Here is my thinking. We do not have an immune system of our own (or little).\n\nThose of us who are getting immune globulin are getting replacement therapy. That is, we are getting the immune system from the general public. The general public in turn, has about an 80% rate of beating the virus on its own, so it is possible that we would match that 80%.\n\nWith that said, however, there are three types of immune globulins - IGG, IGA and IGM. The replacement products we are getting do not supply all three types, they only supply 2/3. \n\nDoes that specific gap make a difference with CVID? I do not know. I am going to call my immunologist and ask. \n\nIn practical terms I am being extra careful. Washing hands, wearing masks and I have not gone out in many weeks now. hi there! sorry it took awhile to get back to you. i was sick but doing better (i do not want to get u to that rn). two things i want you let you (and others) know. first, IVIG has only IgG. sometimes there are trace amounts of IgA in it, but there are not supposed to be (bc some people get a negative reaction to it). secondly, i think, though i am not completely sure, it takes a while to collect,  purify and screen batches of donated plasma to make IVIG. therefore, what we are getting now would not have covid-19 antibodies in it. third, i know that the government is trying to work on testing and collecting those antibodies for testing/screening purposes, as well as for transfusing them to others. hopefully, all the science involving increased screening, treatment, and coming up with a vaccination will happen soon. though...the vaccination might only help some of us, because vaccines only help if they cause our bodies to create antibodies to the injected virus. lastly, i will add that if a vaccine becomes available and widely used, it would of course be SO great for our country, and hopefully all other countries too! as for us with CVID, our IVIG will contain the antibodies one day, but more doses would the antibodies if/when a vaccination becomes available. ALSO, this is important because some of us cannot get certain vaccines directly (like i get the flying shot), but mostly because we cannot be certain we would make our own antibodies from a vaccine. i am not being clear. basically, a vaccine might not work for all of us directly, but IVIG from vaccinated people would", "Looking for opinions Hi all, I have been reading through many of these posts trying to either calm myself down or validate my experience and would appreciate opinions from people with the diagnosis. I am 30F and have been dealing with chronic sinus infections for about 2 years. In March 2020 when covid hit I thought I possibly had covid with how I was feeling, I quickly realized it was likely a sinus infection (I have had a lot before) and allergies so I did not do anything about it. Fast forward to November and I am still fully congested every day, no smell, no taste, runny nose and just feeling awful. So I finally make an appointment at a sinus doctor, they did a CR scan and said I was \u201cfilled with infection\u201d. He said it was the top 20% worst he is ever seen and that I likely had a sinus infection the whole time. So antibiotics and steroids get prescribed but nothing changes. March is 2021 I am finally approved for sinus surgery, where they did about 5 procedures at once including a septoplasty. Following surgery I immediately began allergy shots and so I have had sinus issues come and go for a few months. In Nov of 2021 I got another sinus infection, which the 3 week course of antibiotics did not kick, and now they are saying it is possible I have an immune deficiency. They also told me I have multiple types of bacteria present as well as a fungal sinus infection, they swabbed my sinuses covid test style for that info. Got blood tests done last week to see if my childhood vaccines still have antibodies. As well as another CT scan showing infection everywhere. I have not had covid, I have had all 3 Pfizer shots with almost zero side effects. I have had asthma, allergies (severe seasonal ones) and eczema my whole life. I also was incorrectly diagnosed with crohns at 19, but they were unable to figure out why I have so many stomach issues. I just keep being told it is anxiety induced IBS but I have issues randomly not related to anxiety all the time. \n\nAm I way off base to ask to be tested for this? I have never been hospitalized or anything so I feel like maybe I am being dramatic? Please help.", "Currently being evaluated I was just recently diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia and based on my current test results and history my immunologist says she is highly confident I have CVID.  \n\nI have had a chronic sinus infection for a few years which led to the referral to an allergist.  As soon as she saw me, she said it was infectious.  \n\nSo much of my history can be explained by CVID.  But I feel isolated.\n\nI have been asked to reduce my exposure as I am clearly immunocompromised, so, I am actually isolated as well.\n\nThere is a lot more that I could say but...  I think I just want to know I am not alone. You are not alone! Hello friend! Recurring chronic sinus infections (despite 2 nasal surgeries) spurred my Allergist/Immunologist to check my immune labs. \n\nI have CVID as well. I am not always on IVIG infusions to help, rather, I only tried this for maybe 4 months out of one year's time when my levels were super low, and I needed some assistance getting on top my immune system to knock out a nagging sinus infection. You can learn about these infusions for CVID with a little internet searching, if you are curious. :)\n\nOtherwise, my Doc prescribes cyclic antibiotics, which I *only* use when I know 100% I have a sinus infection. I take antibiotics maybe once every couple months, if needed. Antibiotic resistance is a problem nowadays, but CVID'ers do not really have a choice sometimes. This route is also cheaper than IVIG, depending on your health insurance.\n\nHave a good sit down with your doc, ask about what your treatment will look like, and make sure your health insurance covers whatever you opt for. \n\nStay safe! :) Hi there! I also have CVID, diagnosed in 2013. I have been on SubQ infusions since then, with the exception of about a year and half when insurance denied me and I had to fight them. I am so thankful I won! My infusions significantly improved my quality of life. I used to take antibiotics 6-10 times a year and this year I have only needed them twice, which is HUGE!! I am not sure if that is due to the big increase we did in my dosage in January or being isolated due to Covid, but I will take it! This illness can feel very isolating, especially during Covid, and a lot of people do not really understand it. Hang in there! I have found some of the most amazing friends because of this illness. I encourage you do learn about this illness as much as you can so you can be an advocate for yourself with your doctors. If you do not like the one you have, find someone else, especially someone who will fight for you. Good luck! You have got this! You are not alone! I was diagnosed with CVID a little over 3 years ago and have been on IVIG ever since and it has drastically changed my quality of life. I never knew how chronically sick I was until all of the sudden I was not. I felt very isolated at first because I felt like I was given a life sentence and it did not seem fair but through the past few years as I have opened up to people close to me I have found that everyone is struggling with or dealing with something and a lot of people also have hidden illnesses. It has definitely been harder going through a pandemic as an immunocompromised person but you will find out who in your life truly cares as they will support you even more once they know you need it. I was diagnosed almost 20 years ago and have been on IVIG ever since. The diagnosis was a blessing, as it began to explain previously unexplained issues since childhood. Like the others who have responded, my quality of life has improved, and, while it is at times isolating, especially during a pandemic, I also find my condition to be empowering. With a few life modifications, CVID will not slow you down. In many cases, it will lift you up. Best wishes to you. I am one of the fortunate few who were diagnosed 10 years ago as an adolescent at age 7, and it is only looking at the community that I have realized how blessed I really am. As you have been someone getting IVIG for an extended time, I am wondering if you have found the symptoms associated with CVID to be as drastic as those without the treatment? I also had issues since childhood, but nobody thought until my 20s to check my immune system.\n\nJust making sure I understand the question--are you asking what kind of symptoms I still have, given that I have been on IVIG for almost 20 years? Or are you asking about side effects of IVIG versus what it was like before I started IVIG?", "Feeling hopeless...not sure what to do with my condition I was diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemia/CVID in September of 2019. I received two 2-day IVIG treatments right away (September/October) and switched to Hizentra, with treatments weekly. I had such horrible IBS develop from the Hizentra that I had to switch medications. I went on Hyqvia in January 2020 and have been on it since then. I have had nothing but trouble with the retail pharmacy (OptumRX) and have been had my immune replacement therapy delayed AGAIN because no one can get ahold of the pharmacy. The struggle comes up every single month and it is exhausting. I feel like I have to be the adult that mediates between the insurance company, Express Scripts and the retail pharmacy and it has become such a huge stressor for me that I absolutely dread every infusion. I do not feel comfortable doing IVIG because of how difficult it is to access my veins, and I know scar tissue would form, veins would start to roll and collapse and I would end up dreading those treatments too.\n\nI  feel trapped and my quality of life has become low due to stress, fatigue, complications getting my medication and the pain/discomfort of frequent treatment. I have received a life sentence I did not ask for and I am resentful at times of my life. I am not sure what I am asking for, maybe some advice, some encourgement. I know no one else who has this condition. I have no one else to talk to about these issues. I use Diplomat Specialty Infusion Group.  They handle all of my IG and I would recommend them to handle the drug.  Have you thought of doing subq.  Super easy and convenient.   I am doing 16 g of cuvitru. Hyqvia is subQ, it is 70g every 4 weeks. It does require an IV pump though. I have never heard of them, but I looked them up and sadly they are becoming part of OptumRX which will mean the quality of customer service will most definitely go downhill. Is Accredo an option for you? I have never had issues with them, they are great. Is Accredo covered by Tricare West? I am not sure if you would know the answer to that but I thought it was worth asking! I am sorry, I do not know. I do know every time I call to refill, they say they are an Express Scripts pharmacy so maybe they play nice? For your sake, I hope they do! I had CVS Caremark\nwhen I first started with infusions and had so many issues, I got fed up and escalated to a manager and never had a problem again. Good luck! I have had insurance companies decline my IVIG. Since I rely on insurance to live, I play nice and am very respectful,  but also direct. It also helps when your doctor will go to bat for you. When I first started with IVIG almost 20 years ago, my doctor--not his nurse or admin--called the insurance company and told them politely but firmly that they would be killing me if they did not approve my treatment. That is powerful coming from a third party, and it was approved in short order.\n\nAfter this many years of IVs, my veins have some wear and tear--it often takes multiple attempts to get a vein (my record is about 9). But they always get it eventually, and while the vein inflammation and scarring is a pain, the alternative of not getting IVIG is far worse. I trust my nurses to do their very best and I keep a positive attitude. I think you already know this based on your comments that nobody but you can find the one thing that motivates you to get through this. While it may feel like a lonely battle, know that you are not alone and that there are people out there cheering for you. I have had the exact same problem with Optum but unfortunately they are currently the only pharmacy in my state covered by my insurance, but it is been a real pain to have to delay my infusions because they have skipped months of my deliveries or simply will not answer the phone. There are other pharmacies out there (like accredo as someone mentioned) but insurance is always up in the air and these places constantly change what they will and wont accept. I wish you lots of luck though and definitely understand the struggle with both the pharmacy and how much hizentra sucks ass. Sending you good vibes and hoping you find a pharmacy that works for you! I cannot get the IVIG at all.  All of the Dr's I see in Alabama say they just cannot get it.  Of course they can find it for famous college football coaches, but poor schmucks like me are out of luck. \n\nI feel your pain though.  I am terrified to go out anywhere from fear of catching something.  Its not just Covid I worry about.  I worry about flu, mycoplasma, stomach bugs, etc.  That is on top of the random infections that pop up without any kind of warning symptoms.  My wife says that I cannot live in a bubble forever, but she does not understand what it is like.  I would say find a hobby that you enjoy and can possibly do over the internet.  I am an IT engineer and play video games with people on the internets, or go outside and walk around someplace open.  I take my knucklehead dogs on long walks like that whenever I can.  It helps alot. Wow! I cannot believe there is not a doctor in Alabama that can get you IVIG! I am sure you have tried this but is there a way for you to get on the subcutaneous version? I am on Hyqvia subcutaneous IG. I have, they just do not have it.  Like I said, if you are important enough you can get it easy.  If you are not then you are just up S\\*\\^&amp; creek.  It is infuriating. OP, I have been there. \n\nFrom hopelessness and Hizentra, vein collapse and IVIG, stress and specialty pharmacy screw ups, SCIG and insurance runarounds, coverage denials and appeals, surprise medication switches, exhaustion, frustration, anger, etc. - the whole gamut and then-some. In fact, I just finished straightening out my latest hiccup for my Cuvitru coverage for the third time in a year today. \n\nYes, you unfortunately have to be the adult that mandates between everyone, and I mean EVERYONE. You are your own best advocate, and you have to be with a PI diagnosis. \n\nAs an IVIG/SCIG veteran:\n1. Build a strong rapport with your doctor. Do not be afraid to tell them your fears (which are 100% completely valid) EVER. Your doctor is in your corner with all of this, from treatment type to dealing with insurance issues when needed. Share the level of stress you are under, the amount of fatigue you are experiencing. Log it all. I kept a notebook when doing IVIG. With SCIG, I have an infusion log and I note everything, whether it is same old same old or something changed, and bring it with me to all appointments (now telehealth only.) \n\n2. Take a deep breath. I KNOW the quality of life/feeling trapped/resentment all too well. And all those things compound and affect your health. Been there. Feel free to hmu any time you need to be lifted up, vent, scream, cry. I am here to listen and I promise I am not a total weirdo or creep. Support systems and self-care is SO important as a PI patient and often overlooked. Treat yourself in any small way that makes you happy that has zero connection or relation to your PI. I have left my house twice in 5 months and have only seen 1 human in the past year - but I started a tiny garden (I am a terrible farmer, but hey, whatev!) attempted to do needlepoint (I am terrible at that too, but hey, whatev!), spent quality time with my dogs, took free online college courses (I was not terrible at either of those.) Sometimes self-care means cocooning in bed all day, eating a forbidden food (IBS be damned, mac n\u2019 cheese is my self care go to) or doing nothing at all. If it brings YOU joy, do the thing, take a moment for you and you alone. Cry if you need to. If I only had nickel for every sobbing breakdown on the bathroom floor, behind closed doors, or in the shower over the years. Perfectly acceptable. \n\n3. Stay well hydrated, no matter what you are on. This might seem like silly or random advice, but I wish someone had told me this years and years ago. Also get good sleep, as best you can. \n\n4. Patient support programs are the bomb, especially Takeda\u2019s (they manufacture HyQvia.) Enroll if you have not. MyIGSource (and OnePath) have been a phenomenal resource, from support, bridge doses, explaining anything and everything, printed material, you name it. And it is free. There were days I would have been completely lost without their guidance and they 100% understand, as many of them are either PI patients themselves or have a family member with PI. I have bawled my eyes out on the phone to my MyIGSource patient advocate. We have laughed together. She cheers me on, guides me, and really has built my confidence at being my own best advocate, in not only dealing with/managing my disease, but all the unexpected screwballs that get thrown from insurance and healthcare in general. They also give out pretty sweet swag. \n\n5. Pharmacy access. Love/hate relationship there. I have CVS/Coram who are both my pharmacy AND my benefit administrator. Left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. Easy breezy or a complete nightmare. Be firm with them. Be clear with them. ELI 5 them. \u201cI HAVE AN IMMUNODEFICIENCY. THAT MEANS MY IMMUNE SYSTEM DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. I HAVE TO RECEIVE THIS LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT EVERY MONTH, NO MATTER WHAT, AND WILL BE FOREVER UNLESS MY PRESCRIPTION CHANGES. Ask \u201cIs there a way we can we can avoid having to go through this EVERY MONTH and make it easier for all involved? Is it possible to do auto-renewal? Is there someone there that can be designated as MY point of contact so I have someone who is familiar with me, my condition, and the importance of timeliness and communication regarding my specialty medication?\u201d Feel free to throw a please in there, or not if you are having a bad day. Same with your insurance. Then make SURE your insurance has that pharmacist\u2019s name on your file to contact at the pharmacy directly. Doing this saved me a lot headache. At every point along the road in the lanes of both pharmacy and insurance, always ask if there is a specific person you can call on directly as a point of contact, and do not afraid to write anyone\u2019s name down and reference that you spoke to them. Empower yourself - you call the shots on this. Do not be afraid to make yourself heard and understood. (side story: I spent 8 hours in one day on the phone with them back in September, and refused to have anyone call me back. I was transferred 47 times. I had not had an infusion in 4 months, in the middle of a pandemic, because someone typed in my ID number wrong and it kept getting denied...no one could figure it out even though I repeated \u201cmy ID number is entered incorrectly in your system, we need to fix that.\u201d I went outside and screamed after that call ended. Be heard, be bold, and do not give up.) \n\n6. YOU CAN DO THIS. I will myself, like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. \u201cOk. Wiggle your big toe. Wiggle. Your. Big. Toe. Hard part\u2019s over. Now let us get these other piggies wiggling.\u201d Sometimes it is to overcome the dread of knowing it is an infusion day and what all I have to do and what I know is coming. Other times, it is has been simply to get dressed or function through fatigue. But no matter what, know that you can do this. \n\n7. Last but not least: nope, you did not sign up for this. You did not ask for this. Those exact words have come out of my mouth so very many times. We have a rare condition. Hell, after my diagnosis day, word got out at my job. Rumor mill started churning. It got back to me that I had AIDS, that I had some infectious disease, that I made my condition up and that is not even a real thing that exists, and so on. People even stopped talking to me out of fear of my PI diagnosis...and I work in healthcare. We fear what we do not understand. We also had \u2018friends\u2019 that distanced themselves from my boyfriend when he needed an ear or someone to lean on...they are not friends anymore. I live 1365 miles away from my closest friends and family. I had only my boyfriend, who is my rock honestly, and that is it. My first interactions with other PI patients, someone told me I was \u201cpast my expiration date\u201d because I am in my 40s - I noped away from that quickly, but it stuck with me and really affected me for a while. I was Lydia Deets levels of utterly alone in this and even my primary care doctor was like \u201cDunno what that is, but good luck with it!\u201d So I wiggled my big toe. I willed myself to change my situation, mainly out of spite, but also I had no other option but to. I threw myself into educating myself. I devoted myself to finding terms and ways that were easily understandable for others around me old and new, to describe and explain this condition to them simply. I got my BFFs from back home involved. I reached out to a friend who has MS and while totally different, we still had a ton to commiserate about. I have photo-documented both IVIG and SCIG process, to show \u201cthis is CVID. This is having a PI. This is what we go through. Here is how it works.\u201d I share all my trials and tribulations. And it was cathartic; when I had no one else to turn to - now, I have people to turn to who get it to some capacity, which to me is better than nothing. Find your comfort zone, learn, share, educate.\n\n8. Most importantly, and the hardest thing, is to laugh. We have a running joke that I am never going to get that feel-good pizza party or raffle fundraiser thrown by the community center for being a brave warrior, gosh darn it, because no one even knows what the heck this is and it is too scary. I have put googly eyes on my pump. I have started off phone calls to my doctor with terrible impressions \u201cI am once again asking for you to...\u201d and \u201cYep, it is me. I bet you are wondering how I got into this situation...\u201d Find the absurd bits and smiles when you can, where you can. Find what works for you on that level. \n\nI am sorry this is so long (and I think this is my first post on this sub, so double sorry to everyone.) I feel you that you are in that dark spot and having a rough time, physically and mentally. I want you to know to hold onto hope. I wish I could fight the battle for you and carry you to the other side of that bridge where you can take a breather and recoup for a while, even though I do not even know you, but since I cannot, maybe something in my arsenal can help you across it. You have earned a break. You are every single one of us and we are you or have been at various times. And I promise I will be here for you, or anyone else, should you need me. 1365 miles is 2196.76 km I have been diagnosed for 8 years. I did a ton of research started walking lost 80lbs. I had my first dose of the vaccine. I cannot wait to see people again!", "I have a rare genetic disorder causing me CVID and I feel devastated by how doctors treat me I have a rare genetic disorder and I feel used for science - what can I do?\n\n\nI have been receding into this slumber for the last couple of days and my mind starts to darken and I feel defeated. When you feel this way, how do you cope??\n\n\nI typically react this way when I am overwhelmed by my surrounding circumstances. I am chronically ill with a rare genetic disorder causing my lymph nodes to not develop properly and also my lymphocytes to not circulate as they should. Leaving me with immunodeficiency and lymphedema. Therefore I have a permanent relation to the hospital. I have a life long tendency of developing sepsis. Ive recently started feeling like the doctors are exploiting me to the advantage of science. They want blood tests outside of the lab and their dream is to publish an article about my rare condition. All of this on the behalf of my mental well being. I feel manipulated and used and I simply do not have the excess energy to part take in such studies. Whenever I try to say how I feel I get reminded by them, that all this potentially could come to my advantage one day and I feel entitled to continue. Latest I got a bone marrow aspiration to see how my bone marrow acts and reacts. They took extra material to send to the USA and all this left me with a hole in my back that would not heal for weeks. I ended up hospitalized to stop the bleeding. \nNext they want to monitor how my immune system reacts to vaccines despite me and them being aware that vaccines may have limited effect for me due to my immunodeficiency. So why the hell give me those vaccines?? \nI feel like they mask their research as this and that being essential for me and I often leave the hospital with a feeling of - was this really necessary? Sometimes I feel like a testing animal and that they manipulate and groom me to get on to their newest science idea with the indication that it is recommended for me and might do me good. I am so tired and I really do not want to contribute any longer. I want to be left alone. My biggest fear is that when I am no longer  an accessible intriguing case, my primary care will not be provided as it should and I am afraid that I will get dumped and that is where my devaluing thoughts starts to get the best of me. When I was first diagnosed in 2019 I remember being incredibly bitter towards the doctors. The worst was when I ended up in the ICU at one point do to a cold, and the doctor started bringing students doing their residency with him when he would come by to check on me. It got to the point where I had to tell him I am not a zoo animal and to stop treating me like one. It took me a while to find my voice and stand up for myself but once I did my quality of care went up overall, and I no longer feel like a lab rat. It just takes time and patience to get there. Once you get everything figured out life becomes much better. Just do not do what I did and go to Disneyland thinking if you are careful you will not get sick... Unfortunately this sub is rarely visited.\n\nI highly recommend you subscribe to the follow facebook group's.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth have provided me with an amazing amount of support and advice. Unfortunately when those of us with rare diseases and abnormalities come along, we become test subjects. You have every right to say no, or limit what you are willing to do, and they have to respect that. You are not a guinea pig, you have feelings and boundaries and they need to respect  that. Before going to any doctor, make a list of what you are willing to do and what you are not. Take a support person or advocate with you to visits. Someone who can back up your plan. Your life is not to serve the medical community. They are here to help you. Set limits. Stick to them. You have got this. I hate Facebook. Those groups are full of people who do not seem to have advice, or solutions. I found them super irritating and had anxiety attacks after visiting them because my situation was so different. Agree. Those users on those Facebook groups are always asking advice from others like they are doctors. They put up pictures and want a diagnosis. I have lived with CVID for my entire life. I take immune replacement IV every week. But I do not know the T cell breakdowns blah blah blah, and I get along fine. Sure, sometimes I feel like crap, but I even teach full time. Those FB groups are full of complainers they are exaggerating their condition. No wonder you have anxiety by reading those posts!! I do not know if they are exaggerating their condition. I also do not know anything about their situations. I have been coping and what made me more anxious about it was that they talk about their death and dying but cvid is not a death sentence. Far from it. And that is what I had anxiety about.", "CVID in your country? Hello, I have had CVID from around the age of 10 and from the UK. To me, it is now just part of life. I have infusions every 3 weeks at home. I am very curious about other people\u2019s experience in their country. I understand the treatment is quite expensive but we have the NHS. I feel very lucky. How does it work where you are from? Im 22 and I live in Florida. I get infusions every 3 weeks too but I get it done at an oncology center. My parents pay for it, mostly because I am a college student and can barely afford rent. We have insurance cover most of it, but my parents were having to pay for it out of pocket at first. The cost of it is basically buying a new car, or so my parents have said. But when ever there is a change to my treatment, if I have to get it more frequent or change the dosage, it has to be approved by my insurance.  There is also a short of the medicine, so sometimes I have to wait an extra week in order to get it. Hope you do not mind me asking, how how does it work for insurance? Like will you have to renew it at some point? Do they have to accept you as they know you need ongoing treatment? Hope you are doing well mate No problem! With insurance, it is covered for a year and then we go back to having to pay for a few months, until we meet our deductible again then the insurance will take over the rest until the following year.\n\nI am doing a lot better than when I first started. I had chronic sinus infections for 4 years, which is what made my doctor look into my immunoglobulins, finding I had CVID. I have not  had a sinus infection in months! Good the head! I have been having treatment for about 20years and it is constantly improving. I find I get as sick as much as the average person, if not even less! That is awesome! With your treatments, do you get injections or through an IV? I have IV. I tried the injections but I did not like it. It was every week so rather just have IV every 3 weeks. I am too scared to try the injections. I am terrified of needles, and it does not help that I have hard veins to stick. I posted on the page earlier about whether anyone had experiences with ports. But everyone is saying it is too risky, so I am stuck getting IVs in bad veins. They like to roll and flatten so I get poked 2-5 times per visit There is something called \u2018sub cut\u2019. Cannot remember the proper name. It is like a big syringe which is connected to 4 small pin things. You squeeze your stomach fat and push them into that. It takes an hour but needs be done every week. Maybe look into that if it is a nightmare finding veins. I would rather have the IV though tbh. How long you been having IV? Do you inject yourself? I think your talking about SubQ, but my understanding was that it was an injection, like insulin that you inject yourself with. I prefer the IV, just hate the difficulty of having to get stuck more than once I am in the US and have had CVID since I was 10. The cost has always been meeting my deductable. A couple of grand a year. I have been on subQ since I was 12 or so. I was always averse to needles but pretty quickly I found out putting a needle into your fat is rather painless. I would not ever consider going back to IV treatment. It would be worth to look into financial aid programs. I started on hyzentra and found out about their aid program. I no longer have to pay out of pocket for my meds it has been pretty nice to no longer have to worry when the start of the new year comes along. Nice one! That sounds good. When you say deductible, is this like the excess you have to pay before the insurance pay out. For example, \u00a3500 you pay and the insurance pay the rest?... I had a couple of months on the SubQ but I prefer the IV every 3 weeks. I find I forget I have CVID until it is infusion day. Sometimes feel rough after but generally ok. Why do not you like the IV?", "Doctor Guilt I have an ear infection. I know this because I have had at least one every two years for my entire life. Every time it happens, I end up getting a Z-pack and maybe some drops. This is the routine and it seems to work. \n\nI had a virtual urgent care appointment this morning. I explained this all to the doctor and she said that she could not diagnose an ear infection over a virtual visit. I totally understand but I started crying out of frustration (and pain). She quickly switched and said that she would fill an RX. She also laid on the guilt trip, saying that she could get in trouble. She said that she was worried I would give her a bad review (I never even considered that).\n\nI feel weird. I got what I wanted but I feel guilty. I do not think I was bullying her. I am just so used to doctors brushing me off and not understanding CVID. I had already given up on getting the antibiotics.\n\nAnybody relate? Was it an actual dr or a nurse practitioner? I am so sorry you had that experience. I understand that there are protocols outside of a doctor\u2019s control but I think she took it out on you with that guilt trip.\n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty about. You are advocating for your health in a sh*tty system. I wish it were easier. It was a PA You did not guilt trip your PA. Obviously there is something else going on with her for her to be worried about a bad review, and if she *really* was not allowed to prescribe over a virtual visit she would not, so she is full of it. I have been to so many doctors and hospitals that I do not really have a filter anymore and I will not compromise my healthcare for anyone's convenience or feelings. You did not do anything wrong! That is definitely a weird response from her. I know doctors are getting more and more restrictive about giving out antibiotics. I feel like I know my body and what it needs, and then tell the doctor what that is (ie Z pack etc). I have found a few docs that get it and will just call in whatever I need, but I am sure a typical urgent care is not used to that. The virtual care thing is tough too. I do not feel comfortable going to doctors offices yet but they are all starting to transition back to in person care. God I practically had a full on panic attack because I had to go in person last week. So to add that on to someone with CVID and active infection is cruel and just not a good idea from an exposure/medical perspective. \n\nI do not think you did anything wrong. I find very few docs even know what CVID is, so you have to be your own advocate for what you need. Do not feel guilty. You did nothing wrong. Some doctors, when they begin practice \"go by the book\" to be correct, then later learn that people like yourself often know what works, with a repeating infection like this, and they develop judgement about it, so they are not indiscriminately prescribing antibiotics to anyone who asks for it. When a patient says that they get an ear infection every year and a Z Pack always works, then they go with that at first, because it is a standard treatment for that. They would also know that it is unlikely you are \"faking it\" (who would fake an ear infection?)\n\nNow, for a PA, it is different. They generally work using certain protocols, and part of the routine would be to examine your ear. They are not wanting them to rely on judgement because they have many fewer years of training etc. (Although, some older PAs and NPs who have worked a long time with a doctor or in a specialty do accumulate a lot of clinical knowledge and are qualified to use their judgement in a case like this.) But new ones are really supposed to \"go by the book\", thus her fear of getting in trouble.", "Question about symptoms Anyone with CVID have issues with body odor?? It is one of my symptoms, docs think it is from SIBO, but I am not so sure.  Just wondering if anyone else deals with it.  Thanks. I am not sure if it has anything to do with my Immune deficiency, but I have always had extra sweats, like clammy hands a lot and always really a warm body, always that boy odor in my bed room, always had to take extra freshen up measures. This will be interesting to find out if this has anything to do with my CVID, now Im curious. Hey thanks for replying.  But yea I am in the same boat, especially when my CVID started manifesting symptoms in my early 30's, I have the same issue with warm body, extra sweating and always a odor in my room.  Interesting.", "Selective IgM Deficiency I am pretty certain that this is not the exact subreddit relating to my deficiency but I was hoping anyone here might be able to help me out! I have always had a problem with frequently getting sick and am often extremely fatigued and had no idea why until recently. I just found out that I have an IgM deficiency but all of my other immunoglobulin levels are normal. I have been trying to do some research on my options for treatment and other people's experience with this deficiency but it seems my problem is fairly rare because I am not finding any good answers online anywhere except for possibly IVIG treatment which does not even contain IgM. If anyone here knows really anything about this in terms of treatment or their own personal experience I would really appreciate any help you have to offer! There is really no treatment for selective IgM deficiency unless there was a known genetic defect that we could target with a drug. IVIG is primarily composed of IgG and probably would not help you. IgM is important, but may not explain why you get sick on its own.", "History Seoul Institute of the Arts ", "Potential Pregnancy with CVID and IVIG I have never gotten the chance to ask my physician if getting pregnant would be safe and okay. There is now a possibility that I could be - I technically cannot take a test for another week. I get IVIG through IV every 4-5 weeks. Has anyone had experience with pregnancy and this or asked a physician? I have not but there are two Facebook groups that have quite a few folks that have discussed this issue. I would definitely go there and absolutely speak with your doctors about it!", "Skipping IVIG treatments? My dad has cvid and has been having IVIG treatments for the  last few years. Given the covid situation, would it be advised to  continue treatment, if continuing treatment meant potentially exposing  yourself to a large amount of people? He is 65 and has other health  issues that go under the 'at risk' categories.\n\ntl;dr: Would it be okay to skip ivig treatments for a couple of months while covid-19 exposure is the most prominent? No.  Just switch to subcutaneous IG.  Not difficult and you are a hell of a lot less likely to die. Appreciate the quick response, thank you! If he skips the IVIG for a couple of months, it will leave him a lot more vulnerable to opportunistic infections. An infusion center will be going to extraordinary lengths to make sure their patients are not accidentally exposed to any infections. If he were to skip the infusions, he risks having to go to a doctor's office, urgent care or emergency room where he is far more likely to come in contact with the coronavirus.  \n\nTell him he needs his IVIG, but like u/jespraq said, he may want to call his doctor and ask about switching to subcutaneous infusions which he can do at home. Understood, thank you very much for the information. i have CVID and also have many other risk factors. since the beginning of the coronavirus scare, i have now gone twice to get IVIG. the hospital workers know how vulnerable we are, just like the cancer patients that are treated in the same unit. they obviously wore masks. i wore one in my own in march, and last week they made it a rule that we would wear masks too. \ni hope that reassures you. but mostly, think about what would happen if your dad got the coronavirus without the heightened immunity from the immunoglobulin treatment! Absolutely! He ended up going a couple weeks ago and so far so good. I am glad that the right people are taking it very seriously. i am so glad your dad got the treatment and that so far he is been ok:) i also agree that it is such a blessing that health professionals are working hard everyday, trying hard to do their best! those that are immunocompromised (and their loved ones like you) have a deep understanding of the importance of this. i hope you, your dad, and your whole family stay well", "CVID and Reoccurring Pneumonia Hi all,\n\nAny tips on how to stop reoccurring pneumonia? I take Gammagard every 30 days, but it seems I still get pneumonia twice a year at least. Anyone have some good remedies? \n\nI am 31, in excellent shape, eat extremely clean and healthy. Very low carbs and sugars. I have very good sleep habits. Overall, a great life. Not sure what I can do better.\n\nThanks for any feedback :) Maybe EWOT or lung resistance exercisers  Great thank you! I will look into it What kind of pneumonia? I kept getting bacterial pneumonia (pneumococcus) which led to my initial diagnosis, and I still occasionally get it. \n\nI am familiar enough with the symptoms, at this point, that I can just call my Dr to get a round of antibiotics to knock it out. I do not think there is much you can really do about it, since it is caused by bacteria in the air. Over the last year both fungal and bacteria. Had valley fever here in Arizona, and bacteria lung pneumonia 6 months ago. Now another pneumonia, not sure which. It showed up in a CT and xray, but blood tests did not indicate which one as it was caught early i was told. But if its in the air I guess there is nothing to do. Just got to keep taking antibiotics at this point. Thanks for the response! I supplement with PQQ it helps a lot with fighting infections. What brand would you recommend? Bonusan. But this is in Europe. Do not know what brands are recommended where you live? I am in the US, but I will check it out. Thank you! Did you also check your vit B12 levels? Of up your meat intake ? It helped me tremendously with getting back on my feet. I eat mostly carnivore, with some leafy greens. No sugars low in carbs (as you also wrote). Since doing so, I have a 'normal' life again. Also, for me getting lung infections means most of the time to low dose in plasma. What are your igg levels? I have not gotten my levels checked,  but will next week. Yea I have been doing mostly carnivor diet these last few months and have been feeling great. Also, some leafy greens. That Is why I am surprised I got pneumonia again. But I will say, these last few months have been very healthy and tons of energy. I will def continue with carnivore and leafy greens, as well as healthy fats. Hmm low plasma, ill look into that as well. \n\nMy levels at the end of the 30 days before I get my infusion are typically 400 to 700. \n\nWhat are your levels? Haha. This is so cool! I have not met anybody who has cvid and is on a carnivore diet also! Wow. Nice to meet/meat you!\nMy levels are high, but I think yours are different measured than mine. I am mostly on the 13,5 range, that is were I feel the best. The ranges for an adult is here (in the Netherlands) recommended between 8 &amp; 15. So I feel a lot better when I am on the high end of the spectrum. Right I was thinking the same thing, very cool! Yea I agree I feel the best for two weeks from my infusion date. Yea im not sure why our numbers are so different, I wonder what they are measuring differently. But that is really cool we have been able to do enough research to truly know what works for us! By that I mean the carnivore diet and what right supplements to give our immune system a fighting chance. \n\nI love the Netherlands btw! I have a friend in Amsterdam. I have been meaning to go back. I had planned this year but covid really stopped that from happening. So maybe next year I will go back :) Change to SUBQ Gammard daily. I have done this for 17 months. Pneumonia stopped.", "How often and severely do you get sick now that you are receiving treatment? And other questions. 1.  How often and severely do you get sick now that you are receiving treatment? \n\n2. Have you had sepsis? Meningitis?\n\n3. What is the most frequent sickness you get?\n\n4. Have you ever had to be hospitalized?\n\n5. Were you sick all your life?\n\n6. How long did it take to get diagnosed once you started showing symptoms? Can we get some more info about why you are asking? This seems like a pretty detailed list of personal questions, with no context for why you are asking. Are they really that personal...?\n\nI am asking because I was recently diagnosed after getting sepsis from meningitis and was wondering what others\u2019 experiences were with this disease. I have not started getting treatment yet, I was just given my diagnosis by the immunologist today and I am still kind of floored.  When will you start treatment?  \n\nI do not understand how I am walking around with no antibodies to anything and have not come down with some other life ending disease.  \n\nI can answer the question that no, I have not had sepsis or meningitis, what I get is severe pneumonia, yes I have had to be hospitalized every time I get pneumonia, 7 times total in my adult life now, it is taken 2 months and 4 specialists since I got out of the hospital last to be diagnosed, and yes, I was sick as a child.  Sorry if they are not in the right order. Sucks!!! I started treatment this week. \n\nWhat happens when you get hospitalized for pneumonia? They put me on a 5 day levaquin drip, this time it was 10, IV steroids twice per day, breathing treatments every four hours, and continuous oxygen as my oxygen never wants to come above 85.  This last hospitalization has been the worse by far.  My oxygen would drop as low as 80 even with oxygen.  They would not discharge me until my scans came back clear and I could walk and keep my oxygen up without continuous.", "Helping to find some advices on how to deal with all those \"sencondary\" problems which comes with cvid So I have been diagnosed with CVID when I was 7 years old. Since then I have been taking montlhy perfusions of iv immunoglubuline, and everything was just fine until now.\n\nSince 2020, after almost 20 years since I got my first perfusion, I have started getting sick every 2/3 months. It is always the same: some bronchitis/ light pneumonia, so I 've to constantly take antibiotics.\n\nThe problem is that I am alergic to ciprofloxaxin (aparently the best one available, at least here in Brazil). It causes me red hives on my arms and chests, and two of them for some reason never disapeared after one year, even in the moments I am not taking any antibiotics.\n\nThose residual hivers are not painfull, neither itchys anyhow. But every singletime I have to take antibiotics it gets uglier, more dark~red.\n\nAlso, I have discovered that my lynphocyts have been cronicaly lower. Since I only made blood tests when I was sick (before 2020), we never noticed it, my doctor always thought to be a symptom of a current infection.\n\nBut now that my immunity seems weaken, we started investigating a little further, recent tests (immunophenotyping) shows me that I have:\n\nCD20\n 0% of CD20 phenotype\n8300/\u0173L leukocits\n847/\u0173L lynphocits\n\nCD3\n779/mm3 (92,).1%) lynphocits\n\nCD4\n380/mm3 (45%) lynphocits\n\nCD8\n392/mm3 (46.4%) lynphocits\n\nAlso have a lower natural killer account which today represents 52 mm3 (6.2%)\n\nSeems like they are cronically low since 2015-2016 at least when comparing with older exams.\n\nWould like to know if there are people in a similar situation here. How can we manage to have a life? How bad can this be?\n\nI confess I am really sad this days, with covid, my shitty gouvernement just let people getting sick \"to achive herd immunity\" and a bucnh of stuff separating me of my sweet life I had until 2019. \n\nIt is been over a year without seeing my friends neither my girlfriend, I do not know how bad the fellings can inpact our immune system. \n\nWould be great hearing a little from you people, and see how are you keeping your lifes, dealing with your jobs and living life at all.\n\nA huge thanks, sorry for my typos and grammar mistakes, english is not my firts language. Have they discussed if you need to increase your dose of IVIG? If your IVIG is no longer working as well at the same dose, that could explain an increase in respiratory infections.  Just know that you are not alone. Many of us go through the same thing, and we often are able to eventually find ways to lessen the issues to the point where we can cope with them. I hope that you find an answer to your symptoms.\n\nLiving life in a pandemic is challenging. Since last March, I have not spent much time outside of my home or car, other than for medical appointments and work. My state here in the U.S. never really closed down for COVID, so I stay in my office with the door closed all day. Nobody is allowed inside, not even to empty the garbage and all of my meetings are via computer and phone. It is lonely living in a bubble, but I make the best of it by finding peace and happiness in the things I can control. I am not sure what is easy to come by in Brazil, but can you get access to Azithromycin?  It has done wonders for my chest infections for a long time (I have taken it 3 days a week for at least 10 years ).  You might also see if you can get nebulized hypertonic saline (if I were to have a lung infection, I would use that).  I am having a hard time comparing your TCell test results to mine but even among those of us with CVID we do have different TCell responses.  I know CVID conspires against us, but keep searching for solutions and advocating for yourself.  Also agree with u/Noonofnite re maybe getting more IVIG. Hey friend, I will give you a list of things that have worked for me. I take every week twice a day for two days (Monday and Tuesday, morning and night) sulfamethoxazole-tmp ds. This helps keep infections to a minimum. Supplements that have been a game changer. NAC, Zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C, elderberry, echinacea. Some strong alternates are black seed oil, Chaga mushroom, (garlic, ginger, bioperine and turmeric- made by medchoice). Another game changer was diet. I switched to a carnivore diet and that has taken away tons of issues! Keep up the good fight! Let me know if you need me to expand on anything. Good ideia, I will suggest Azhitromycin to my doctor on my next appointment, so thanks. Never associated it as a treatment for respiratory infections, curiously people are using it here as an \"earlier terapy for covid\" which comes in a Covid Kit, due some creepy fake news. At least I know for sure it would be easy get access to azhitromycin.\n\nAbout my allergies, seems like I have it for all antibiotics based on quinilone (levofloxaxin also gives me the same allergy response) They are going to increase my dose from 30mg to 38mg (I promiss I will have a look on which units America does use for it and try a conversion on a next post). They have decreased it a little in mid 2020 since I reduced the intervals beteween the infusions from 4 to 3 weeks), I hope this augment in my dose, keeping the intervals shorter, helps on reducing the recurrent infections.\n\nReally good to know you are keeping somehow your job routine. I am trying a similar thing, as I work with robotics in the software team I did manage to keep in home office for most of the time, but every now and then I have to go presencially which is sometimes scary. No luck here with antibiotiques, unfortunantly I also have allergy to sulfonamides medicaments.\n\nI never tried any supplements, now I am really curious about them, would be wonderful if they reduce my recurrent infections.\n\nI remember I have already saw people talking about the carnivore diet in a cvid group years ago, how did you discover that this could be any relpful? \n\nThanks for all the advices! Also my doctor is thinking about to treat me with antibiotics continuously (for now I only take then when I am already sick, coughing and having fever). I was a bit scary of it at first, but I am seeing that a lot of people with cvid also perfomes continuous use of some antibiotiques + IVIG/SCIG. I love the carnivore diet. Look up the book Carnivore Cure by Judy Cho, and Carnivore Code by Paul Saladino. These books changed the way I look at food. I have never felt so good!! Well now. I am not going to talk about Judy; in fact, we are not going to talk about Judy at all, we are going to keep her out of it!\n\n---\n\n- (\n\n^(I am a bot.) Yes. It is the single best thing we have done for my lung and sinus health. Azithromycin is a great choice as it also has anti inflammatory benefits. I have drug reactions to many penicillin based antibiotics. I mostly dislike taking the quinolone antibiotics and will have to really be in a bad way to want those. Some people have better results with getting their infusions every 2 weeks instead of monthly. It creates less highs and lows which is when you are more likely to get sick. Talk to your doc and see if it is an option", "ARTICLE: The reason I qualify for a Covid-19 vaccine has nothing to do with the fact that I am immunocompromised. That needs to change  Young people with compromised immune systems are being overlooked despite their higher risk of severe illness.

Usual low igg and IGm that just so happened to be tested by a doc after going to many, sent to an immunologist and then failed the vaccine challenge. Thanks so much for the response! What is the vaccine challenge if you do not mind me asking? When I try to look it up it gets buried by Covid vaccine articles (of course CVID is almost spelled the same lol) For my daughter, she had Chronic EBV with documented recurrence of Mono 5 times over 4 years and multiple bouts of pneumonia. \n\nDoc finally tested her with the pneumonia vaccine - followed her response for 6 weeks and it was like she was never vaccinated. That got us on the right road for testing and treatment.\n\nWhat kind of doc are you seeing? Thanks very much for the response! That is very interesting. So far I am seeing a rheumatologist (that is very unhelpful), but I have also seen an endocrinologist, hematologist and urologist for a plethora of mystery symptoms.\n\nI am now wondering if I should ask to see an immunologist? What would you suggest? You absolutely need an immunologist.  Get a good one.  Not one that is clinic is built around seasonal allergies. Usually the good ones are in, or associated with, hospitals. I agree completely, immunologist ( that is not just an allergist) and possibly an infectious disease doctor. Some of them really focus on immune issues as well. My main culprit was my sinuses.  It was ENT that discovered it and said \u2018 there something else going on\u2019.    I always suffered with strange infections.  About 15 yrs ago I asked my Dr to test my immune system she said it was but not that low..  I am guessing she did my IGG.  That was when I was referred to immunology.  They did vaccine challenge and my body only responded 3.   Started on IVIG.  Good luck.  You need to be your own advocate. Thank you so much, I will start looking so I can ask for a referral I actually did see an infectious disease doctor but forgot to mention it as he did not find much. I have been a mystery case for quite some time :( will look into seeing an immunologist though!  I was having recurring pneumonia,  but for various reasons was not seeing the same doctor consistently so it went undiagnosed for years.  I also suffered from fatigue, sore muscles,wooziness and random nausea.  Had a blood test that confirmed very low igg levels, then was vaccinated and produced very little response.  Began sub q plasma treatments and do them weekly.  I definitely get sick less and other symptoms reduced, but still there on occasion. Yes, I am interested in this too! My husband saw an infectious disease guy in the process of getting diagnosed. this was more for eliminating what it could be, as far as I understood it!  Had a lot of the common symptoms.. stomach problems, skin problems, recurrent infections, fatigue.  I had my immunoglobulin levels checked constantly with no improvements and had a vaccine test done where I showed no response so that is how I got diagnosed. I am waiting to be diagnosed. IBS-D symptoms since 2012 getting worse and worse. I started getting a lot of fluid in my legs some years ago and it was found out that the culprit is low albumin. Symptoms getting worse and worse over time and a year ago got tested for low IgG and ferritin. Started having severe nausea and vomiting in the last couple of months while on Budesonid, which only made things worse for me. Now also IgA and IgM are low, but CD4 is within normal range which is something I thought should not be happening. I have not had any other issues except a golf elbow and I have flu less often than my wife and kids. But my gastroenterologist is still convinced that it is CVID. I hope the meds will work, we will start with GI meds and should start immunoglobulin IV in a couple of weeks. I hope it works but frankly I am sceptical. I read about this in an article. They test your antibodies before and after a vaccination and if your body fails to produce the antibodies, it is another indicator for CVID.", "Can you have normal globulin levels and low immunoglobulin levels?  Yes. If you are concerned about CVID testing IGG, IGA and IGM are helpful. There is more after that but it is a start.  Not sure you should be concerned yet about having CVID. More that it would be nice to find out if there is a root cause. You are good, dude. Highly doubtful.", "CVID Hello!\n\nNew here...\n\nI was wondering what routine monitoring people have with CVID as well as what symptoms/labs when you do have infections. My sister has CVID and usually will not have a high WBC count or mount a fever when she is having an infection. I find that my WBC count is usually below normal until I get an infection in which case it will jump into the normal range.  A normal WBC is a clue that something is amiss (for me).  Body temperature is another possible clue: fever and chills usually mean something pretty severe for me.  Run of the mill infections, like a sinus or chest infection, might not have much impact on my body temperature. Sepsis will cause high temperatures for me.  The other thing when looking at infection is to figure out the cause.  If I get a meaningful sinus or chest infection I try to get sinus or sputum cultures done so that antibiotics can be targeted.  My biggest problems while on immune globulin treatment have been those cases when my antibiotic treatment was not right for the bacteria causing the infection.  In some cases, stool cultures can be useful to diagnose gut issues whether chronic or acute.  In terms of other routine labs, I get CBC, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CHEM-20) and have various mostly fat soluble vitamins monitored.  These are more to monitor digestive and liver health (ALP, AST, ALT, GGT) oh and finally IGG level.  I hope this helps. Thanks for answering!\n\nWe have also learned that a normal WBCs means infections... currently hospitalized with meningitis/peritonitis with a WBC of 8 and only one temp of 100.7 F. When we can usually pinpoint the symptoms to a source of infection, we try our best to get cultures/sensitivities when we can. However, we are usually turned away due to no fever and normal WBCs despite history of CVID. We have found that CRP is usually the most responsive in regards to actually elevating with infection... I was wondering if anyone has found other markers being responsive in regards to indicating infection. My sister is poor at actually verbalizing symptoms due to cognitive impairment, so we have to rely on VSS and behavioral changes to  indicate that something is going on.\n\nIn regards to antibiotic choices... does your AI specify whether or not that bacteriostatic or bactericidal antibiotics should be used in congruence with sensitivities? This is our second hospitalization with meningitis/peritonitis within 30 days despite a prolonged antibiotic course. I am worried that ID is not looking beyond what the cult/sens show. \n\nShe gets IVIG regularly and has appropriate trough levels when we do check. However, the other routine labs we have not checked regularly... looking online, it seems that PFTs as well as monitoring for lymphoma/other GI cancers may be recommended. Looking at this group, it seems that others are getting other labs in regards T cells and subtypes... any labs in regards to innate immune function?\n\nThanks again! My CRP does not seem to move much in response to infection, not sure why.\n\nMeningitis and peritonitis ughh. I assume someone has done blood cultures.  I do not know anything about bacteriostatic vs bactericidal.  In my experience with one brain abscess and a few sepsis, they all resulted in 4 weeks plus of IV antibiotics delivered through a PIC line.  I am not a medical professional of any sort, but know that for brain infections the blood brain barrier is difficult for antibiotics to cross.  I know with the abscess I had to take Vancomycin for 6 weeks or so.  With the blood infections I had to take IV antibiotics like Ceftriaxone and cefepime for four weeks (including hospital time).  With CVID, longer duration antibiotics are not uncommon.  I am actually on Azithromycin and Xifaxan prophylactically to prevent sinus/chest/gut infections.  I am a big proponent of prophylactic antibiotics when faced with recurrent sinus and chest issues.\n\nI am more concerned that you are getting turned away from treatment if you present with a low fever and normal WBC.  I am sure you are doing this, but keep the routine test results so that you can show the appropriate physician that a normal WBC is not normal for your sister.  The instructions from my doctor to me... unexplained fever, chills, night sweats... get blood culture at hospital or on the way.  The key to this happening and working is that you have Doctors that lead the way whether that is primary care or specialists.  You should accumulate a fleet of doctors who will stress the seriousness of your situation and advocate on your behalf.  I have a primary care physician, immunologist, infectious disease doc, neurologist, pulmonologist, gastro, liver, hematologist. My most powerful advocate and the center of this team is my immunologist.\n\nRegarding your other research, yes PFTs are a standard barometer for monitoring lung health.  I used to get them once per year and would be still if it were not for COVID.  I have my lymphocytes and Tcells and such tested every couple of years.  I get a colonoscopy every 2 years.  I have to get endoscopies every year.  I have annual or semi-annual chest CTs depending on what is going on.  Yes, those with CVID are at a higher risk of cancer but it is not an outrageously higher risk. I have also had full genome and exome testing done.  Anyway, this is an expensive disease at times and I have described an approach that is expensive in time and money.  Things will not always be this bad for your sister, I hope, but when they are it is critical to stay on top of things and advocate as powerfully as possible on her behalf.   I hope some of this babbling helps. I would make sure to get a CBC when well to document her WBC baseline. I have neutropenia, and I can tell you that with documented neutropenia a fairly minor fever will get you right to the top of the list. Our hospitals have been on divert due to Covid, but last time I went to the ER I did not even sit in the waiting room. To be fair, at this point my WBC count is low even with an infection. Anyway, my point is that triage knows nothing about CVID, but if you have documented low WBC counts they are more likely to take that seriously.\n\nIt is also just a good thing to monitor. My WBCs were normal when I was really sick for years before I was diagnosed, and in the past few years have plummeted.\n\nAs far as other types of immune testing, I got the T cell checks on diagnosis and since then only in conjunction with a bone marrow biopsy for cytopenia. I have not had a fever since I was but a wee lass- not even with Shingles, Kidney infections, complicated pneumonia, Mono, or like Strep Throat (my tonsils came out when I was 17 bc it was as frequently bad as it was frequent) My WBC is frequently only high normal, which they think probs contributed  to the difficult and delayed diagnosis, kind of as tho they did not know they were really infections or something.\n\nIt took some time but I learned that mouth sores, and especially the splitting of the very corners of my mouth means something is wrong. Sweating buckets in my sleep is pretty reliable too but my main go to weird symptom is hives. Hives everywhere. \n\nThe Dermatomyositis rashes as well,but since DM is also very rare, they are not entirely sure it is a thing bc limited Data. COVID had been reported to have cause both the onset of Dermatomyositis and its flared so they are slightly more confident the disregulation is connected to the poor activation or some shit. It is complicated tho and no one seems to be super sure about everything so probs keep a keen eye out for the extraordinary. \n\nTwo years ago my Immunologist wrote me a script basically saying CVID! If she says she is sick she probs is. Extensive work up required. Please call with any questions. He also printed all his numbers on the back. \n\nA bit drastic maybe, I guess? but when I met him I would just been discharged from the Hospital (VA, and he is Civilian) a few days prior and they missed a serve form of Pneumonia that probs should have killed me. All of my immunoglobulins were low-low too, which were not checked until it became critical probs for the same reason they admitted me onto the Infectious disease ward for the first few hours. \n\nIt was wild. My WBC\u2019s stay elevated and stays that way for over a decade. I have not run a fever since I had MRSA several years ago. I do not get labs for every suspected infection but I do have every infection cultured to make sure I am on the right antibiotics. I see my immunologist every 3 or 4 months. She orders labs (CBC/CMP) then. I did IVIG for almost 10 years and now do subQ treatment at home.", "Much needed update ", "Scientist vs Anti-Vaxxer.

Im already on a thin ice with this being my life as it is, and these complications just kick my mental health even more. Fyi, already been on hizentra and IV infusions. I can only talk to my immunologist on my appointment, once a year (already have been this year\u2026). Ill be thankful for any advice. Okay. I cannot imagine no nurse/practitioner has told you this.

I am curious about all of your experiences. I am 28 and have gotten sick at least 4x a year my entire life, but it is usually a bad cold / strep throat / whatever is going around. Otherwise I just feel exhausted and like I am constantly in a fog 365 days a year. I learned about CVID from the paper at the link below because I have a history with EBV/mono, and also had really high levels of human TGF-beta, so it seemed to align. I asked my MD to test my immunoglobulin, but maybe my symptoms thus far are not consistent with CVID? \n\nI am also happy to be referred to other internet sources that you all might think will be helpful. Thank you! \n\n Got sick from black mold.  Treated the mold and got better, but never felt well. Continue tremor, wide spread pain, and a laundry list of other physical issues.  Went to a toxicologist, literally because I felt toxic and he tested my IgG, which resulted in a referral to an immunologist and subsequently failed the vaccine challenge. That was around 43 years of age.  Prior to the mold issue at 41, never went to the doc, did not have a primary, and did not even have insurance for most of my adulthood. Thank you so much. It is really interesting that you mention mold because that was why my doctor tested my human transforming growth factor in the first place I was sick my entire life with constant bouts of pneumonia, lung infection, sinus infection, strep throat etc. I finally went into sepsis in my mid 20's and while in a coma they found out what was really wrong. My IGG levels were 16. Now I have been on gammagard for 7 years and have never been happier. Rarely sick and loving life :) Oh mylanta!! What a relief!!! It totally is! I feel like a brand new person. Now I know what its like to be like most healthy people. I had constant infections all my life, including 7 bouts with pneumonia. I had a sinus infection that would not respond to a wide variety of antibiotics over 9 months, and that was the infection that landed me into the hands of an immunologist in my late 20s or early 30s. I recieve IVIG ever since, and my infections have decreased to a number I can manage. As a result, I am generally able to live a fairly normal life and grow my career. Stomach issues led to my diagnosis. It was not even severe, and there were only a few indications of a weakened immune system. I got HFM in high school and my coughs always lasted a bit monger than my friends. The doctor I went to for stomach issues did a full blood work up and it came back very low for immunoglobulins. That led to a visit to the immunologist for further testing. My IGg was 97, IGm was only barely countable and IGa is not present. I was 23 at diagnosis. Thankful for that dr and his request of bloodwork! They would sent my bloodwork and history to UW for Dr. Ochs because of my lack of illness and suck low numbers, but that immunologist has passed away so nothing ever came of it, at least not to me. I have been prone to infections my whole life, and often get much more sick than others with the same thing. Recently I started having a lot of digestive issues and lost weight. My doctor was casting about for answers and ordered a celiac test. I do not have celiac disease, but incidentally she found that I have low/no dectectable IgA. So she tested all immunoglobulins and sent me to an immunologist. My IgG and IgM are low, too. So my immunologist sent me for additional bloodwork--6 big vials, over $2,000 (fortunately I only had to pay $100). In the meantime, I have spent the past week with a low grade fever and exhaustion, again. I hope there is some kind of therapy for me out there! I hope so too. Thank you for sharing your experience with me! Thanks. All the best to you, too. As a kid I had a very thick record with my pediatrician. I had multiple ear infections when I was a baby all the way through elementary school.Inalso had strep throat a lot. Then I started getting sinus infections from middle school until about two years ago. I have had scarlet fever.I had a weird infection once where my nose swelled overnight, drs were baffled. I also had pneumonia once and it kicked my butt. Finally when I was about 30 I was referred to an ENT. I had a hugely deviated septum and very swollen turbinates which could predispose me to sinus infections. Thankfully he tested my immunoglobulins as well as my pneumonia titers and we learned that I had an IGG defeciency and poor response to the pneumonia and Hib vaccine. I had my nose done two years ago and that has helped tremendously. However this year I have had four strep infections as well as UTIs and skin infections so I began ivig treatments this month. Hello! Tired and foggy here, too! I never really felt like I was particularly \"sickly\" but I was Always tired. Like, \"how will I ever make it through this day\" tired. Every day.\n\nMy long story short is, in 2017, I ended up in the ER with jaundice and dark urine. Next morning, spleen ruptured. Eventually found out it was mono/EBV gone bad. Did not get much follow up because I did not have health insurance.\n\nWhen I finally got insurance, I started the slow process of advocating for myself. Like that narcolepsy commercial, I knew i was \"more than just tired.\" Asked my PCP to refer me to an immunologist, got the vaccine tests and immunoglobulin tests, and now I am on Hizentra. Got my official CVID diagnosis on March 11, 2020. Stomach issues, skin issues (dry skin, rashes), and body odor issues. I went to an ENT begging for sinus surgery (to reduce the size of the sinus cavities) because of my recurring sinus problems. While I do not have a full-blown infection more than once a year or so, I have sinus problems CONSTANTLY .. and it really does impact my life. He said sinus cavities are small for a reason and it is very rare that he does sinus surgery. He pulled bloodwork and noticed I was deficient in one IGG group, low across the board, and the majority of my antibodies are of poor quality (they have a way to measure this). He then had me do the vaccine challenge and I failed. Thus, the diagnosis. I have not been approved for immunotherapy by my insurance company but also have not invested much time into turning that around.", "CVID + COVID-19 Hi! I am brand new to Reddit. I was diagnosed with CVID \\~3 years ago. I am 26 years old and currently do weekly infusions subcutaneously. I am curious to see if anyone has been diagnosed with coronavirus and how that experience has been for you? Also pretty new to Reddit, and I actually had the same question, and would love to hear people's experiences, if there have been any. It seems like the vast majority of the accounts I have read for people who have had Covid-19 have been those who ended up in the hospital, and none have been specific to people with CVID or any other kind of PID. \n\nI think there is a strong possibility that I had it, but there is still no way to know for sure. First, just a quick note on my individual case/clinical presentation of CVID: I am 37, was diagnosed with CVID at 24, and have been receiving monthly IVIG through at-home infusions administered by a nurse for the past 5 1/2 years. I never have any constitutional symptoms of CVID that are not caused by something infectious; I do not experience fatigue, malaise, pain, or anything like that. I feel fine unless there is a specific infectious agent that is causing me to be sick. The primary manifestation of the CVID for pretty much my entire life has been upper respiratory infections (with an occasional GI infection), so this is something I am pretty well-versed in, and I know what feels normal for me and what does not. The upper respiratory infections are usually viral, and either go away on their own after a week or two, or develop into acute bacterial bronchitis that I have to take antibiotics for, and that usually knocks it out. I do not generally get fevers from those types of infections, and only occasionally experience fatigue. I have fortunately never had to be hospitalized for anything related to any kind of infection.  \n\nAt the very end of Feburary (maybe 27 or 28), I ended up with another upper respiratory infection, but this one felt very different. It started with the worst sore throat I have ever had: a burning, searing pain when I woke up that did not really get better after drinking water. That lasted for maybe 2 days, and then progressed into a dry cough. At that point, I started experiencing other symptoms as well. First, during the afternoon of the day I started coughing, I remember being on a conference call and feeling like all of the energy in my body was just being suddenly drained out of me. It was a very strange, very sudden feeling, and I had to fight the urge to lay down until the call was over. Then I developed a low-grade fever (~100), and woke up sweating two or three nights in a row. I also had chills and felt cold during the day. After a few more days, the dry cough eventually turned productive, and I just felt completely exhausted. Getting up and doing even menial tasks was draining. I would say that the acute symptoms (cough, fever, sore throat, congestion, shortness of breath) lasted about a week, and then I had another week of residual fatigue and post-nasal drip. This all resolved on its own, though, aside from the feeling of shortness of breath, which still not gone away completely. It is gotten much better since my immunologist put me on a budesonide inhaler, and she said it is probably residual post-viral inflammation. \n\nSo all that said, I still have not gotten tested. I live in northern NJ and work in NYC, and my symptoms appeared when the first cluster was popping up in New Rochelle. I did not think much of it at the time because there were no cases reported yet in the places I frequent, but they are now saying that the virus was already likely established in the Tri-State Area in early February. Also, three of my coworkers were confirmed positive in early March, right around the same time as me, and a close friend of mine (who I hang out with a few times a week) had seemingly the same thing I did, and it even started on the very same day. It took him a lot longer to get over it, and he did not even feel like he was starting to get better until 2 weeks after he started having symptoms. Based on all this evidence, I would say there is a really strong chance we both had it. \n\nI ran all this by my immunologist (who works in a department that specializes specifically in CVID), over a telehealth call, and she said it was quite possible that I did have it. She said that anecdotally, they had been seeing that their CVID patients who had the virus actually were faring better than a lot of the general population, with the caveat that there are still too few documented cases to draw any meaningful conclusions about. I asked her if there was a chance I would make antibodies to it, and thus show a positive result on an antibody test, and she said it is not definite, but theoretically possible. I still just have not bothered to get tested yet in part because so many of the antibody tests still seem unreliable, and also because I would rather not go anywhere near a hospital or medical facility right now since I live right in the epicenter of the worst outbreak on the planet at this point. \n\nI know that is a long-winded post, but I have been scouring the internet all the time for any info on how the virus has affected people with CVID, with very few results, so hopefully this is helpful! Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to write your experience! I am sorry you went through that at the end of February. I too am located in NYC and my immunologist said similarity that people who receive IVIG have been faring better than the general public. \n\nI am hopeful that it will not be too bad, but, I cannot help but find myself fearful for what is to come the next year-two years.... No problem! And I know what you mean, it is really scary to read the projections on how this plays out. I wish I could know for sure if I had it, even if it turns out I did not develop antibodies against it, so that I would at least know that my body is capable of fighting it off if I got it again. That would help put my mind at ease somewhat (at least for myself... still incredibly worried about everyone else). In the meantime, it is just a lot of being extra careful, and also trying to limit my news consumption. Hope you are staying safe and healthy (and sane)! We are definitely in an area where those things are even tougher than usual for people with CVID these days... Hey,\n\nalso new @ Reddit, also Northern NJ, also CVID, and might have had an extremely mild version of the COVID but was not confirmed.\n\nI am 46, diagnosed with CVID 8 years ago and have never had any serious symptoms.   I had ITP (autoimmune platelet disorder) 5 years prior and recovered.   My CVID diagnosis was not due to recurring illness; I presented at an oncologist's office with a number of swollen lymph nodes and after several biopsies and many examinations to eliminate other causes, was referred to an immunologist.   Primarily, I seem to be more likely to suffer from sinusitis, but not much else (yet).\n\nIn mid-March, my wife felt tired and had a fever for about 24 hours.   She had some chest congestion the rest of the week but a Dr. visit over the phone suggested she had only an upper respiratory infection and she was given OTC meds and a mild antibiotic \"just in case\" it was bacterial.   By the end of that week, my nose was mildly stuffy and then I completely lost *all* ability to smell and taste.   My sinuses actually cleared but for the next 7-8 days, I could not taste anything.   Not salt, not sugar, not anything.  Typically, when I would lose my sense of taste, maybe I could exhale through my nose and get a sense of something.   This was almost scary -- like I could accidentally put something in my mouth that could kill me and would never recognize it.     After nearly a week, I also saw the doctor and described my symptoms.    By this point, I was having severe headaches and tenderness within my sinus cavities.   He called it a likely sinus infection and gave me Augmentin Rx to help it resolve.  Within 36 hours of starting the antibiotics, my taste buds were returning and my sinus pressure followed.\n\nThis was just around the time that \"loss of smell and taste\" was getting to the news anecdotally but it was long before it was added to the list of potential symptoms.     Now they list several sinus congestion and symptoms as potentially related.   At the time, i think my doctor saw it as coincidence and maybe power of suggestion.\n\nIn follow up conversations several weeks later, my immunologist thinks I probably had it, but said it would not be worth testing because I likely would not make antibodies for it regardless.   I am fortunate to have Type O blood, as I see that it seems to correlate to fewer infections and impact.  Not sure that plays a part, but I will take what I can get.   \n\nI have read a few things that indicate that CVID itself does not necessarily increase our risk, and I am thankful for that, but this continues to evolve and I remain cautious.   \n\nBe well and safe everybody! Thank you for writing. Saturday i started experiencing chills...no fever-ish feeling or aches...but they were chills no doubt. My nose has been mildly stuffy the last few days, and I have just felt fuzzy and out of it. My stomach has been upset more than usual.   \n\n\nOne thing that stood out to me from your post - sinus pain. I had tenderness and pain within my sinus cavity on Saturday and I thought it was so strange. In the waiting room for the Teledoc now...but it sounds like it is very likely I could have COVID. Though, I will say, it feels very, very mild...for now. I should update - I was tested and the results came back negative! 100% this week. Hopefully, it will stay that way...", "worried I have CVID - blood work Hey guys,\n\nI was hoping to get some knowledge from people here. I suffer from some pretty extreme health anxiety since late 2019 and I have gone through thinking I have had numerous things. As a result I had my immunoglobulin checked in 2020 for something unrelated to CVID and my results were quite low. I was a little worried at the time but kind of dismissed it. Recently though I found out about CVID and thought back to these results and now am kind of freaking. \n\nWould really love thoughts on these. For context I take simvastatin, enalapril, and prozac. I am 31M. At the time of these results I was extremely stressed and getting not much sleep.\n\nIn June 2020:\nMy IgG was 717 mg/dl and the normal range was defined as 700-1600\nMy IgA was 217 mg/dl normal range is 70-400\nMy IgM was low at 34 normal range 40 - 230\n\nFour months later in October my Neurologist wanted a test for other reasons (ruling out Myeloma due to Neuropathy) and my results were *slightly* better. I was still in the throes of anxiety at this time:\nMy IgG was 778\nMy IgA was 243\nMy IgM was 37\n\nThey are posted here in full format: \n\nI had the covid vaccine a month ago and I felt a little under the weather for two days after the second shot (pfizer). Just a little tired and slight aches.\n\nI do not really get sick that often but I also do not go out that much and wash my hands obsessively due to my OCD. Not a doctor. You do not have CVID. Not even close. You may have anxiety issues or hypochondria or something but you do not have CVID. If you did, it would not be 717, 217, and 34. It would be 421, 97, and 3. \n\nBest of luck, friend. Hey man, thanks for the response. I absolutely have anxiety and hypochondria (OCD related). I am trying to work on them. I am not a doctor, but I do not believe you have CVID either. Prior to my diagnosis, extremely low counts for all three were what caused my Hematologist to look into the issue further. My counts have stayed pretty consistent for the past 10 years: with my IgG around 300, IgA around 40, and IgM around 15. I also had to \u201cfail\u201d a titer test in order to be diagnosed. My Hematologist tested my immune response to a number of vaccines I had received in childhood, to which I had none. Then, I was given several vaccines and tested 30 days later, again having no immune response. It was a combination of low immunoglobulin counts plus a failed titer test that resulted in the diagnosis. \n\nAfter I was diagnosed, my sister also had her immunoglobulins tested. Her results were similar to yours in that she was in the normal range for two and slightly low on IgM. Her doctor (and mine) reviewed her results and provided the same feedback - no cause for concern. It is also worth noting that some medicine can impact immunoglobulin levels. I am not familiar with the medicine you listed, but I thought that would be value added to mention. \n\nSpeaking further on CVID, it is important to understand that every patient is different. I am connected with a few different online CVID communities, and I have seen a huge range of situations. There are people who have much higher counts than I do, but they are much sicker than I am. One thing that is usually consistent is that we all have been more sick than the \u201caverage\u201d person, so the diagnosis helps explain that. \n\nI would be happy to answer any questions about CVID, but again, I do not believe you have it based on what you have described in your post. \n\nGood luck! I hope this helps alleviate some of your anxiety! Hey, those numbers are actually pretty good! Unlikely you have CVID. As a comparison, my IgG was only 97 when I started infusions, IgA was not detectable, and IgM was &lt;10. \nA response to the vaccine is actually a great sign. \nI mean this in the most sincere way, have you tried speaking with a therapist regarding the health anxiety? Therapy has been a tremendous help for me over the past year and a half. We have all had a rough go, so remember to give yourself some grace. Hey thanks for the reply. I guess I saw the 700 number was so low across what appears to be such a huge range that I started to worry as I did not have the context. Sorry that you are having to deal with CVID it sounds no fun at all. I definitely need to get into therapy, all the best to you! It really does help alleviate the anxiety, so thank you!\n\nI feel weak and selfish for having posted my concerns here in the first place as I do not want to make a mockery of what you folks deal with but I certainly feel better. I wish you the best and pray for even better treatments down the pipe. Do not feel weak or selfish! I certainly cannot speak for everyone with CVID, but in my experience, I know what it is like to feel like something is wrong with your body and not have the answers. That is not a fun experience, and I hope you get the information you are looking for. \n\nIn a weird way, COVID helped more people become aware of disorders like CVID and other immune system deficiencies. If that helps diagnose more people, or it helps people become more in touch with their own health, that is a good thing that has come from a really bad thing. Like others, I am not a doctor, but, when I was diagnosed my IGG was so low it was considered undetectable. It is been a while, but if I am remembering correctly, I think anything under 30 is considered undetectable. And I think mine was literally like... 8. Just 8. Lol. I had also spent a full month a few months before that fighting off a simple upper respiratory infection that I would picked up from my college dorm (which is what set off the whole diagnostic process). I think you are fine, and I hope this gets rid of some of the anxiety."]
