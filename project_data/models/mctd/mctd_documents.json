["For those of you with organ involvement, how long did it take for your MCTD to reach the organs after diagnosis? Just askin anyone who is open and willing to share out of curiosity, it is been almost 5 years since I was diagnosed and my symptoms (namely my fatigue, pain, and raynauds) have gotten worse each year. So, it made me wonder if that something that might be around the corner too\n\nSo yea I cannot really answer your question, as I was only diagnosed 2 years ago and my organs are okay so far, but I am curious to hear any answers. Good luck op \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I am curious about this too. Recently diagnosed and recently symptomatic. Not everyone gets organ involvement. My mum (late 60s) has had an entire pick and mix of autoimmune diseases for her adult life Inc lupus dominant MCTD (like me) and has almost no major organ issues, apart from occasional fluctuations in kidney function. Saying that, the pain and fatigue and rashes she has are bad enough. But if you are a milder case, perhaps you will avoid the worst of it? Here is hoping! For me, skin involvement came nearly immediately (yes, skin is an organ - in fact, the largest organ of your body via the integumentary system). Urticaria was the most annoying symptom for me, after nearly thirty years of Eczema. \n\nAfter about ten years, with sporadic rheumatologist care, I developed a problem with my kidneys and they had to bring out the DMARD meds, etc. Thankfully, I now have a great rheumatologist who was able to knock the kidney issue into submission, but by then I would already developed primary RA. \n\nFind a good rheumy and stay on your meds, folks. What were the symptoms associated with your kidney issues, if you do not mind me asking? Poor appetite, tiredness, getting up all night (well I am middle aged and in menopause) to pee, insomnia, itchiness all over, etc. Cheers, thanks for letting me know. Kidneys are important and I want to keep mine as long as possible! Sorry you went through all that, it is a fierce disease. I have the lupus butterfly rash on my face still no matter what I do with meds or cortisone. It gets worse occasionally so about once a month I slather cortisone cream on and it fades it a bit. I also have this insane itchy ear I have no idea why. I assume it is eczema, I have had two doctors look at it and neither can figure out what the cause is. I have tried steroid oil in it. Did not work. I just put miracell ear oil in it every few days when it gets bad. It still itches even when I am religious about taking my meds, itches with the oil, itches with cortisone cream, itches with eczema cream. It is gotten worse since being pregnant so at this point I am blaming hormones.\nThose are the only \u201corgans\u201d that have been involved for me. The rest has just been severe joint pain until I was on my meds for a while. I also had a lot of back pain and issues with disks rupturing and inflammation around my sciatic nerve etc. which has eased up on my meds. May I ask what brought you to a diagnosis? This is currently one of the suspected issues (between sle and mctd) and the organs are what brought me to a rheumatologist. Just curious, no need to answer if it feels too private! Question for you about kidney involvement - that is detectable via blood tests or otherwise correct? As in your doctor was able to confirm or catch it happening? Recently went to the doctor because of frequent urination, however no infection and nothing else found in the bloodwork. Symptom seems to correlate with a month long \u201cflare\u201d, but never had this specific symptom before. Doc said all organs look good but feeling like a crazy person at this point. Blood tests, yes. They keep a good eye on mine because I have a common comorbidity of Diabetes Type II (years of steroids will do that, unfortunately, to some). \n\nSometimes we just pee more, especially since Sjogrens is in our component diseases and we need to drink a lot of water. Well. I was diagnosed with mctd 5 years ago and developed organ involvement over the last year. Now I see every specialist on the map\u2014- at first it was just mctd and now I see Rheumatology- Mixed connective tissue disease, rayuand syndrome, lupus/SLE\nNeurology- Chronic Migraines \nNephrology, Kidney Disease- High blood pressure, thickening of heart muscle \nEndocrinology- hypothyroidism \nDermatology-  Seborrheic dermatitis\nGI- Irritable bowel syndrome \nGynecology- pcos \n\nAnd as of last week after being discharged from the hospital after a bad flare\u2014- Hematology/ Oncology- evaluating for possible lymphoma or ALPs( Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome) swollen lymph nodes all over .... sooo case in point.... It took 1 1/2 years to develop all of these diagnoses and the mctd is still uncontrolled. I have tried immunosuppressants, steroids, cellcept, methotrexate, orencia, plaqenil- nothing works so that is that. I am soooo sorry that you are having to go through this. Does anyone have a specialist that is extremely knowledgeable in MCTD at one of the large clinics? Cleveland, Mayo, etc.. and anyone you would recommend? I am in the Houston area so if anyone knows of a great doctor out here I would love a referral. Thank you in advance,", "Helminths Disclaimer, my GP said my numbers were pointing to MCTD and the rheumatologist said it was not a sure thing, and to come back later if I was still experiencing problems. The test that they disagreed on was an ANA test. The GP is very invested in my health and running tests, and the specialists I visit (usually all at the same facility) have consistently told me to take an aspirin, come back later, and refuse to run any tests. So, I did not go back. Anyway\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmore than a year ago I started having pain in my feet upon waking up. (I am a 34 year old woman with no prior history of this kind of pain.) Every morning the pain was severe and walking walk very difficult. Usually the pain would dissipate over the morning. Someone I know wanted me to try helminthic therapy, I was game. For anyone who does not know, helminths are parasites that cannot reproduce in the body. My specific brand of worm was necator americanus. I started with a low does of 5 transferred to a patch and left against my skin for a few hours. I could not see the worms, but I could feel them, and the application was a little itchy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin weeks the pain was lessening. I have since had three more doses, each as the pain was starting to return, each around four months apart. My pain is much better than it was, and I am surprised because I did not expect it to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are up for a different kind of treatment I recommend it. They work by stimulating the immune system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\" Helminths have been proven to be potent immune regulators through secreted/excreted molecules that enable them to evade their hosts defenses and survive by stimulating production of anti-inflammatory immune cells. During our long and constant coevolution with helminths our immune systems have developed to expect their presence and rely upon their immune modulating influence in order to function properly. \" (( As someone with mctd the immune system is already hyper stimulated which is why we become sick. It develops antibodies to our internal organs and attacks them. Our medications suppress our immune system to disable the attack. Taking something to stimulate our immune system like this alternative treatment is not wise for most of us. But I am glad it is working for you if it is. You should definitely get a second opinion if your specialists are ignoring you. It may not be mctd. Unfortunately one component of mctd, lupus, is called the great imitator - the other great imitator being lyme disease. Both of these diseases have so many symptoms that are shared with various other things that the only real way for diagnosis is to rule everything else out. Here is a literature study of helminthic therapy.\n\n I wonder how it works. I suppose it distracts the immune system, rather than increase immunity. Increased immunity makes mctd worse. Looks like it is not that well understood yet", "Have you tried a naturopathic doctor? If so, can you please tell me about your experience?  Hell no! Do not mess with Big Placebo when it comes to your joints, organs and future mobility. I am just curious about other peoples experience. Some have contacted me with things like lupus and fibromyalgia saying they have been in remission since seeing their natropathic dr. Basically just being on a strict diet, taking supplements and what not. \n\nI dont believe I should just stop taking my meds and only take a holistic approach, but I do think mixing the two approach\u2019s is a good way to go about it. I would not discount the importance of diet and supplements  (vitamin d and magnesium for example) but I would say you can find a lot of great advice from people in the lupus and other autoimmune forums (since this one is pretty dead). I do a combo of natural and pharma approaches. I do not see a naturopath as there is too much quackery but I see a concierge MD who believes in both. He is expensive and based in Scottsdale but does telemedicine visits if you are interested. He does not take Insurance so I just see him every few months and get regular meds from a rheumatologist.", "Lupus Headaches  \n\nHello ! I am a Rheumatologist, currently in my 4th year of residency in Romania. I created a YouTube Channel, Flagship Medicine, where I post highly researched medical topics.\n\nI created a video about Lupus Headaches, because my passion is SLE with neuropsychiatric manifestations. I hope it brings value to your knowledge and if this is the case, I am waiting a comment on my YouTube Channel. Thank you very much!\n\n( Thank you.  I have shared this with other support groups Hi ! Thank you very much for your support! \u2764\ufe0f\nWhat did you find most interesting ? That the newest rheumatologists are trying to help.  Our community has many stories of docs who just shake their heads, do blood tests, and prescribe pills, and then set up a six month appointment, instead of trying to help. Also, I have a question.  Does your screening involve considering breast implant illness as a triggering event? Thank you for your kind words ! Yes, I try to investigate deeper and all aspects of patients' concerns - pain, fatigue, social activities etc. So far, almost all the evidence is against this connection. But I would keep an eye on surgeries that involve foreign tissues. The truth is you cannot know for sure. I am only speaking from a friend\u2019s experience.  She suffered for 11 years, was diagnosed with several autoimmune diseases, and when she was put on Arava, she went steeply downhill in three weeks.  Just had her explant last week, and already has normal blood pressure, is off all her heart meds, and can walk stairs again. Thank you for sharing this! I am sorry that your friend went through this! I think any foreign body/implant can trigger some kind of autoimmunity in our bodies. Even a blood transfusion - it is a foreign blood and even if it is phenotyped, it is still foreign and our immune cells can react. \n\nHope she will be better from now on ! Thank you.  She is, too. And now, she is on a mission! Will definitely check it out. It is wonderful that a doctor is actually looking at lupus headaches as a real thing. I get them all the time and it is so frustrating because I have two children and it is so hard telling the older one I cannot play because I have a headache. None of my doctors have seemed to care nor have any prescribed anything for my headaches. I go through entirely too much excedrin. I have tried pretty much everything. Extra caffeine, no caffeine, hot showers, cold showers, ice packs on my forehead/eyes/neck, warm packs on my eyes/cheeks, massage, vibrator massage on my neck and base of skull, chiropractor, benedryl, I mean you name it. Recently I have been exploring cervicogenic headaches to see if this is possibly my issue. My most recent headache I woke up and my left eye was blurry. Within two hours I had a headache that lasted two days. Hi! Thank you for sharing this! \n\nI am sorry you go through this, unfortunately if you are experiencing lupus headaches you have to take Prednisone or else they will not go away. It is pretty clear that if you went to so many treatments with no success, your doctor must thing about lupus headaches. \n\nI hope you will get better soon!\n\nYou know, I always say even to my patients, there are many other doctors out there...For myself I went to many doctors :)) trying to meet someone with a different point of view, a different approach. So I encourage my patients to look for other opinions, maybe I am not well prepared for a certain topic. \n\nIf you liked my video, please leave me a comment on the YouTube video about what you liked most and what you did not liked :D I want to improve myself and it is easier if I have all the comments out there. Thank you very much for your time and support ! If you liked my video, please leave me a comment on the YouTube video about what you liked most and what you did not liked :D I want to improve myself and it is easier if I have all the comments out there. Thank you very much for your time and support ! I just did that.  Thanks for reminding me. Thank you very much! Thanks for sharing the video Thank you for your appreciation ! :D", "How do you all cope with headaches? I was diagnosed with mctd as a teenager, and I mainly only experience Raynaud's so have not circled back with a rheum in a few years.\n\nIn the last month or so I have noticed more frequent and bothersome headaches \u2014 sometimes\u00a0severe migraines, sometimes mild tension headaches, and sometimes cluster headaches. I am not sure if this has anything to do with my mctd, or whether it is triggered by my high screen time with WFH. \n\nHow do you all cope with headaches? What works for you to continue working/reading/etc as needed for work when bogged down with headaches? I have had migraines since I was 5 years old, and I was 13 when I had the first symptoms of MCTD, so I do not think they are related.\n\nI suggest you try to figure out your triggers, since preventing is always better. Mine are cigarette smoke, chocolate and red wine, also change in weather (which I cannot control unfortunately). \n\nOther than that, it depends, really. Regular headaches I just treat with a painkiller and continue. If it is a migraine, I prefer to rest, but my migraines like to last for days, so it is not always an option. I have turned on dark mode on practically all my devices, even if I do not have a migraine or headache, it still feels better on my eyes.\n\nI would also suggest seeing a neurologist as they might be able to treat it better. \n\n(PS; my sister without MCTD has noticed a significant change by wearing \"blue glasses\" when using her computer? I would have to ask her more about it though) It might be worth investigating it with your doctor. When I started getting headaches my rheumatologist was surprised, it ended up due to high blood pressure. The other time it was due to caffiene withdrawals. The only thing that has truly helped my migraines is Botox shots in my head/neck. If you can get approved I would look into it.", "Enlarged lymph nodes  I have MCTD and also have had swollen lymph nodes for extremely long periods of time. When I first got sick, my lymph nodes were the reason I knew something was off. The lymph nodes all over my body (not just in my neck) were swollen for almost a year. The good news is that eventually the extreme swelling and soreness went down \u201con its own\u201d and is pretty much gone now (I can still feel them but they are not painful). However, I cannot tell you exactly what helped me. I can tell you the things that I had tried. My doctor helplessly recommended lots and lots of green smoothies! I thought it was a joke but I was so sick of feeling sick that I gave them a try, along with getting 9 hours of sleep EVERY night at the same time, and informing work that I needed to work no more than 8 hours per day (I eventually adjusted this down to 6 hours per day). Getting into a low stress routine was key for my immune system to calm down. It is not a cure-all by any means but it cannot hurt. I have permanently enlarged lymph nodes on my neck. When I am going through a flare, they feel the size of a marble.\n\nNone of the doctors I have seen have been particularly worried and chalk it up to the fact that my body seems to hate me a lot of the time. It is good to hear what is working for you! My husband does landscape architecture for a living so it is a very physical and demanding job. Things tend to slow down a little in the winter with less daylight hours so hopefully that means less flares and maybe his lymph nodes will settle down. We eat mostly paleo during the week and his doctor has him on a plethora of supplements (fish oil, turmeric, etc). Thanks for sharing! Thank you for your response. It is nice to know that other people experience this problem as well. My husband\u2019s doctor thinks it is strange his lymph nodes are swollen as it is not a \u201ctypical symptom,\u201d but apparently it is pretty common with MCTD.", "Not Dead Yet: Raising Voices, Building Awareness, and Finding Hope Hello all, fairly new to the MCTD club (about 2 years now). Not a club I would have chosen to be a part of but working hard to be grateful for the knowledge and awareness it has given me. I do know that in dark times (which seem to pop up more during flares) having a community of people that understand the trials, heartache and loss that comes along with an \"invisible disease\" makes me feel just a bit less lonely and a bit more sane. That said, I want to call attention to the \"deadness\" of this sub. It is not dead, members are just rare! Fortunately for most and unfortunately for some, MCTD is a rare disease affecting only about 2 in every 100,000 people. There are even fewer of us with MCTD that have the energy to be active online. All of us, though, would likely benefit from the same kind of support. My hope is that this sub is just in the early stages and building traction - as is the research of the illness that brings us all here. MCTD is a rare disease with symptoms that differ from person to person, can be excruciatingly painful and cause mental health ailments that can be just as debilitating as the physical ones. Do not even get me started on the confusion, torture, and expense that is the process of diagnosis and treatment. I completely agree that urging people to use more active subs (like r/autoimmune) when they are looking for answers is helpful (no argument from me here) but I also hope that at the same time we can urge our community members to have an active presence here on r/mctd. This should be a safe space for us to share information, experiences, and lessons learned. It is completely understandable if your activity and contributions to our community are as varying as the flares of MCTD themselves but just know that there is always someone out there who can and wants to help you, and someone who can and wants to be helped by you. Please, bring awareness to our community for the sake of our health. Let us support this community, let us support each other. \n\nMore Voices = More Awareness = More Hope.\n\nI would love to hear thoughts from the community. All of you, the lurkers, the veterans, and the newbies! Comments or DMs - talk soon! Hey!\n\nMCTD diagnosed in January 2020 - CTD since September 2019.\n\nI have made very good experiences with general rheumatoid and autoimmune comnunities.\n\nTake the AI fam and friends-Discord! They started out primarily for SLE, but honestly, many symptoms overlap and they are open for everyone.\nReally is good for specific questions, general venting, supporting each other and sharing stuff to be happy about.\n\nIn Germany, we have a big rheumatoid association where there is support groups. Most are RA or Bechterech but they still understand rheum struggling, pain and all this!\nI even joined (in the capital) an assistant teacher in rheumatology for teaching med students. That gave me \"access\" to a network of several CTD patients to ask questions if needed.\n\nWe could try to pin a post with best support opportunities per country to the top of the sub, what do you think? Wonderful idea! I, myself, would find it extremely helpful to know what organizations, support groups, and information sites exist out there. If anyone has groups/associations/organization in mind that they would like to share I would be more than happy to compile something for the community! Thanks u/rosepetal_devourer for the suggestion, hopefully the community has some ideas! The fb MCTD group is large and very active Diagnosed with MCTD in 2017. It can be debilitating at times. I was in a good place prior to quarantine, but I have slipped into poor eating choices and drinking too much which make the symptoms worse. It would be really nice to have a community here for support. The Facebook groups seem to be overrun with complainers. We all need a place to vent, but I only have so much emotional space to give. I would like to hear more about what treatments are working and what medical advancements are taking place. Thanks for trying to breathe life back into the group! Really appreciate the feedback! Thank YOU for speaking up! I am hoping to drum up some activity and get people talking about the same things. I welcome the occasional rant or vent session but I also would love to see a steady flow of discussion and content for those that return to the sub for support. Hey! Thank you for revitalizing this group!  I have been trying to join the Facebook group for the last week and for some reason they keep declining my request, which has left me pretty much without any sort of support or place to go to ask questions.\n\nI am mid diagnosis right now and awaiting a referral to a rheumatologist but my internal medicine doctor feels that signs point to MCTD and after doing lots of research it was like a wave of relief washing over me because finally for the first time in my life I have a doctor listening to me and I do not think I am crazy. This sub was made because the FB community was filled with whiners and frankly people self diagnosing themselves without ever consulting a doctor . I was one spoon meme away from punching my keyboard lol \n\nI too have slipped into poor eating and drinking choices on and off over the years. Drinking excessively renders your DMARDS null. Beer has purines and histones that can give you gout like symptoms or trigger a flare up , however we are all human . I am so glad you are here then!\n\nIt was not all that long ago that I was going through the diagnosis process and felt like no one was listening or trying to help me understand what was going on. Diagnosis or not, hopefully this community can answer some of your questions and provide some support in a very tough time. It is only just started to pick up in activity but it feels great to have a community that understands what you are going through. Woo, you would even do this?\n\nWhat do you think about starting another poll to fish for suggestions which links to pin to the top? :D\n\nThe AI fam and friends discord mods are okay with us pinning the discord invite link here: (\n\nAnd, well, there is the big facebook group that I am no part of but that has 10.000 members: (\n\nI am not really versed in the US system, but I found a list on this site ( that suggests various closely related associations.\n\nFor Germany, it would be ( .", "How open are you about your illness? Everyone handles things differently. There is no right or wrong answer here.\n\n(", "Long term vaccine side effects I am pro vaccination, just want to throw that out there! And I know how important it is for people with autoimmune conditions to get the vaccine.\n\nThat being said, I think the vaccine caused a flare that has lasted more than 4.5 months. Within a week of getting the shot in May, I became extremely fatigued, cannot breathe, and sore joints. I have been to the doctor 10 times and no one can tell me what is going on. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what has helped? What kind of doctor have you seen? Primary, pulmonologist. Waiting on rheumatologist later this month, booked for months. I also had an EKG and CT scan of my lungs Yes, my first Pfizer vaccine caused a huge flare up and non stop headaches/migraines. It took me 5.5 months to work up the courage to get the 2nd shot mid September. I am still flared up from that one. My rheumatologist, neurologist and the pharmacist all said it is common for the vaccine to cause a flare of of autoimmune disease and migraines. My neurologist gave me a 3 day high dose treatment with dexamethasone (steroid) 10 days after my second shot to try to break the flare up. Unfortunately I do not do well with steroids and it just made me feel a lot worse. I am definitely not looking forward to getting these shots annually. Good ideas.  Also, get appts with neurologist, psychiatrist (so you can tell your other docs you are not suffering a mental illness), and possibly a genetist. Ugh yes thank you!! That is already come up. That it may be neurological or anxiety but it is definitely not. I got my j&amp;j shot March 30. I have been steadily getting worse and worse all year. To the point that my hands and feet are hurting like crazy all times of day. My back has been hurting. My neck has been hurting. I went to a spine dr. Had mri\u2019s done. Did physical therapy. Nothing helped. I have even been doing sublingual cbd thc. I was wondering if my hydroxychloroquine somehow stopped working or what the hell is going on. My rheumy gave me an rx for meloxicam and that does not even touch the pain. (The cbd seems to help however). I never thought it would be side effects this long term from my shot. I have my annual (every 3 month) bloodwork and rheumy appointment soon. I will know if I am in a flare then I guess. Feels like it. Just trying to save the hassle. Helps to be able to say you have got the doc to back you up I tend to have asthma attacks from vaccines in general, so I had everything ready for one after my first shot. It was not too bad in my view though I did make the nurse nervous. Bad headache for a day.\n\nSecond shoot was even less of a reaction. \n\nThird shot was one of the worse reactions I have had to any vaccine. Asthma, vomiting, migraine that lasted a few days.\n\nI am in one of the John Hopkins studies so I have been getting bloodwork at various intervals; after the third shoot I finally had antibodies like a normal person. I am glad I am fully vaccinated. I felt pretty awful for a few days after my second shot but had zero side effects after the 3rd. I do not think I had any flares or anything related to the vaccine. It could be side effects from the vaccine. There is no solid research as to side effects of the vaccine with people who have autoimmune issues. The unknown is what is scary. Usually vaccines have 7-10 years of research before being used. There was no choice with the covid vaccine so it was put out before all research was done. I hope you feel better soon. Are you on other meds for pain? Or just anti-inflammatory? Sending healthy hugs! Only on hydroxychloroquine. My doc wants me on methotrexate but is against prescribing it until my hubby and I have two forms of birth control. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f been taking cbd in the meantime \ud83d\ude15 Yea dangerous for pregnancy. Have you gotten a second opinion?? I have my appointment today but may think about getting a second opinion..especially for the meds. Nah I like my rheumatologist and she pretty much prescribes me stuff when I need it. She just gave me a script for prednisone today to tide me over and reduce my inflammation. Going to do another round of it and see if it helps. I think I am in a flare. I had a nasty cold (not covid) september 19-first week of october and have felt unwell autoimmune wise since:( Sorry you are not feeling well. I definitely know the feeling. I have been sick since 1997 with different issues. Saw the rheumatologist today. Kind of frustrated because i felt like whatever questions I had, I did not get straight answers. I did get on that list and there is a rheumatologist about 4 hours from me. I called and he actually answered the phone. I spoke to him for about 20 min and have an appointment this Saturday. As for now, I am on hydroxychloroquine .. \nare there chances that blood work could produce false positives?? Just curious.. I do not think so but usually when you start seeing a rheumatologist they will run their own testing because it will be way more in depth and with their preferred lab. Lab results do vary. So prepare to become a pin cushion for a bit :) but then it will probably drop down to bloodwork every 3 months as just an ongoing monitoring thing. My first visit she ran 19 different tests but usually these days its about 3. All very informative and what they use to diagnose along with symptoms. I already had all the bloodwork from last week from the first rheumatologist. The second said he does not need anything further. Just bring test results. I will see when I see him. Seems very knowledgeable as he is heavy into research for MCTD. Hopefully you get some answers! I actually went to my rheumatologist that is pro vaccine in general.. he then asked me if I am taking the vaccine and I said no. He asked my reasoning and I went through quite a bit of my \u201cwhy\u201d. He then said you are smart. I said I thought you were pro vaccine? He said not in all cases. He then informed me that he sits on the board for one of the vaccine companies and that there is research that has already been done and not yet out on vaccine and autoimmune issues. He said it is his responsibility to be honest with his patients and that 1 in 6 autoimmune patients have severe or irreversible reaction. He said\u2026 it is like putting 1 bullet in a six chamber round and \u201ctaking a chance\u201d. Being on this board I know there is not much research so I am just relaying information. I am not getting into a pro /anti vaccine debate. Those that are interested, that is what the doctor said.. I thought it was quite interesting and cannot wait to read the research when released!", "Short Answer Sunday: Do you have or have you had pain in your jaw/TMJ from MCTD? Give us the short answer....but feel free to expand in the comments!\n\n*If you comment, consider starting with the answer you selected either  or . But no pressure if you would like your vote to stay anonymous.*\n\n( Not sure how to vote! I was diagnosed with TMJD many years before my MCTD diagnosis. So \u201cmaybe\u201d??? Ha ha. I wear a mouth guard because I clench my jaw at night.", "meds besides plaquenil? hi everyone I have ctd and have been on plaquenil for almost half a year and its basically just changed my symptoms instead of made me feel better and also made me not able to remember anything and has made me confused to the point where it interferes with daily life and I had to stop taking it a while ago and now ofc im doing worse with my body attacking my tissues and w/e. anyway I have a dr appointment in a month and I am going to ask if there is anything else I can try besides plaquenil, idk why I cannot find anything on google so I hope someone here can help me. I would just wait until I can ask her but I dont trust her at all, she does not take my symptoms or pain levels seriously, so here we are.. thanks in advance What kind of doctor do you have...rheumatologist? I know a lot of people in another MCTD group i am in take methotrexate, some take biologics. yes The only thing that keeps my symptoms under control are either high doses of prednisone (which my doc will not let me do) or a combination of methotrexate and hydroxychlorquine I take methotrexate and prednisone. I was misdiagnosed for about 20 years though and almost died twice before they finally did the right blood work. I am old, and old women who complain get ignored a lot. Anyway the damage to my body has been significant and I can barely walk at all without all this stuff. I learned to be an asshole to every doctor to start with, then pleasant as hell when they actually listened. It worked, they respond to this shit and begin listening better every time. It is ridiculous that I should have to play these games to be heard, but there you go. I would prefer to be polite and remained so for a lot of useless years. Good manners are important, but I refuse to die for them. I would suggest you add a neurologist to your team, as well as a pulmonologist, a geneticist, a dermatologist, and a psychiatrist.  Some people cannot tolerate plaquenil, and your rheumatologist should know that.  Perhaps, you need a different rheumy.  Many of us go through several before we find a good one,  and I hope you do not have to tolerate a bad one (like I did, a couple of times).  There are the \u201cbiologicals\u201d as well as  some older meds.  Use sites like Mayo Clinic to find more information, I take plaquenil and Benlysta. The combo has helped me tremendously. I am on etodolac and it really has helped me in the past 4 months I have been on it. Sorry I am a little late to the party but I take inmuran. I was allergic to plaqunil and did not respond to methotrexate as a child. I have been taking it for 8 years now with no issues and it has helped a lot. I take prednisone when I get injured or have a flare(injuries, forgetting to take my meds for a few days, or high stress tend to cause flares). My doctor only like to use it as a short term drug. I take plaquenil methotrexate and sulfasalazine", "My raynaud's is spreading, scleroderma-like symptoms with no diagnosis ", "Plaquenil has turned my hair brassy/reddish - What to do? I have been on Plaquenil \\(generic\\) for a while and now my hair is this weird, brassy\\-reddish\\-coppery color. I kind of hate it. I just started back up at my seasonal job and all of my co\\-workers from last year were asking me what color I had dyed my hair... I had to explain that it is a medicine I am taking that has changed the color and no one has touched my hair in a year and a half...\n\nHas anyone else had any experience with this? Normally my hair is a mousy dark blonde. Are there any shampoos to help change the color to something more normal?\n\nI cannot stop taking the Plaquenil because \\(thankfully!\\) it has almost \"cured\" me and I am so close to being completely pain\\-free I feel amazing physically. I have not had this experience from plaquenil, but I used to dye my hair. I would suggest using one of those purple or blue shampoos. It should tone down the brassy color. That Is crazy! I am in the beginning of plaquenil still, but it seems to have slowed my hair loss, I was losing a LOT. It is not growing back or anything, but it has slowed. I do not know if there was a color change, as I keep my hair dyed purple! But so curious! \nIf you want just a subtle color, maybe buy a dye close to your original color, and dilute it with conditioner and just wash in some color every so often? \nAnd, thanks for giving me some hope about the plaquenil working! :-) ", "Possible diagnosis? Confused! A nurse practitioner reviewed my blood work with me over the phone (due to COVID) and mentioned that my RNP came back at 1.0 and that if I wanted she could refer me to a rheumatologist if I wanted. \n\nI was a bit panicked and said I would implement diet changes first. I have a positive ANA already due to hypothyroidism. \n\nI have some joint stiffness in the morning but it usually resolves itself after a minute. Feeing quite panicked and worried. \n\nI am not sure where to go from here? Is a 1.0 definitely indicative of mctd?\n\nThanks I think you could benefit from seeing rheumatology. I have had mctd for 6 years and I have a positive RNP, ANA and RF.... I am also in the process of a hypothyroidism diagnosis. \n\nI am not a doctor but I believe 1.0 is on the barrier of positive. \n\nYou may need an Anti-RNP\u2014- \n\nAnti-RNP antibody levels are elevated in 100% of patients with MCTD and 38%-44% of patients with SLE. That is why seeing rheumatology is a good idea\u2014 they would know what other labs to order that fit a MCTD diagnosis. \n\nI wish you the best! Hope they can figure it out soon. I know it is scary. Trust me, you are not alone in that feeling. I think it is best to tackle what is in front of you and get the referal to the rheumatologist. If nothing else they may be able to help put your mind at ease. They know more about MCTD than your NP would so it is best to have them check you out. Aside from that, I recommend cutting processed foods and getting 8-9 hours of sleep for a couple weeks while you wait for the rheum appointment. Mctd is a diagnosis of exclusion which means they will rule out more serious illnesses before giving you that diagnosis. MCTD is not a life sentence. There is a pretty good remission rate. I have even noticed my symptoms have gone down since I have started: no processed foods, mostly plant based diet, cannabis, and light but consistent exercise and movement throughout the day - just remember to listen to your body and not over do it.

My dermatologist and rheumatologist have just nodded and said variations of \"hmm, interesting...\" but it is still unsettling. \nI have had a skin biopsy due to polymorphic light eruption and my dermatologist took a sample that included a scar that reactivates but did not get anything conclusive from it. \nUsually it is old scars from bug bites that get angry; they turn purple and itch but settle down again. This time it is an old burn on my finger and it is gone from being fully healed to looking like a fresh burn in the space of a couple of days. \n\nInsect bites are my other issue. I am like catnip to any nasty bloodsucking critters, even if I douse myself in bug repellent, they still get me. Does anyone else find they not only react badly but take a really long time to heal? My legs (for some reason, they always go for my legs even if other bits of skin are more exposed) look like someone is put cigarettes out on them because they scar so badly. \n\nSorry if anyone sees this multiple times but I have cross posted to a couple of subs. I do not have reactivated bite reaction, but I am very very sensitive, to the point that I must stay indoors.  And they take weeks or months to heal. I do not have reactivated scars. I do have an very old deep contusion that will reactivate and really start throbbing from time to time.\n\nI am going to tell you something real strange about the bug bites, though, so bear with me. I used to be pretty attractive to bugs, but it was not until I was diagnosed with MCTD that I would get hyperreactions where I would have to take an antihistamine to make them bearable. I would get huge welts and horrendous itching. Then I got a stool transplant. Now they do not ever bite me. It is crazy. I take that as proof that it the attraction comes down to microbiome. Granted, it is just anecdotal, but it is like night and day. Before the stool transplant, I could not even last 30 seconds outside. Now I do not even notice  them. That is fascinating and I am so glad you found something that worked for you. I may mention that to my rheumatologist because I really struggle with antihistamines. Even the non-drowsy ones knock me out. We had a warm spell in March and I was bitten while working on our pond. I still have unhealed bites from back then! While I am sorry you deal with the same thing, it is comforting to know it is not just me. Have you tried H2 blockers like Tagamet or Zantac? They are sold as heartburn medications, but they are antihistamines that work particularly well for allergic reactions involving the skin. They do not make me tired at all.\n\nThe stool transplant was actually for a C. Diff infection and the insect bite decrease was a happy accident. Stool transplants are not FDA approved yet, but I am convinced they are the future of medicine! You might want to try pro-biotics, though. I have a whole jar of steroid creams. Steroid creams make mine worse. It seems like it is the moisture of a cream that is the issue. As soon as they are exposed to moisture, they get more angry. It used to be miserable when we only had a bath. Switching to a wet room has made my scars heal so much more easily but the water is still an issue. My scars do not reactivate but bug bites, scratches, burns tale forever to heal. Also I have really bad reaction to bites... I hate that I do not even have normal looking skin anymore because it is all covered in bruises and scars from tiniest injuries that just stay there Yes! I am so self conscious about my skin. I refuse to wear skirts or shorts because even with tights, I feel like people are looking at me. My left arm is horrendous because of polymorphic light eruption and I try to wear long sleeves as much as possible. \nI am so sorry you are dealing with this too. I know the feeling.. But let me tell you, you really should wear short sleeves and skirts and anything you want. I really understand the struggle, but our bodies are going through so much, in constant state of battle, they deserve a little love too. Even with all the skin reactions and imperfections, that is your body, the only one you have. I honestly do care about looks and how my body looks, and I am in overdrive with skin care products and shit, which is maybe too much focus, but when it comes to wearing stuff I really wear whatever I want or whatever feels best and I encourage you to try and do the same. I promise you that other people are not judging you as hard as you are judging yourself", "Hello everyone I was so happy to see there is a sub Reddit for MCTD! My goodness it is such a rare disease I had no idea it even existed a year ago! I just wanted to share some of my story\n\nAfter my second pregnancy at 24 when my son turned 9 months, all the sudden my joints became very tender and swollen. So swollen and painful that I had trouble walking, picking him up, everything was a struggle. It did not help that I was also talking care of a 2 year old by myself at home. \n\nIt took forever to get an apt with the rheumatologist because of my stupid HMO insurance. Once the rheumatologist opened the door to the examination table she said \"I was the worst patient she had seen that year and it was def RA\". She told me I had to  immediately stop breastfeeding my son and to start the drug Embrel and methotrexate with 60 mg presnidone. She also prescribed tramadol for the pain. \n\nI hated being on embrel. The shots were painful, it gave me huge bruises, the methotrexate made me sick and made my hair fall out I saw little improvement over the year that that particular Doctor treated me. I had multiple flairs and the emotional pain was almost too much to bare from going from devoted mother to sick person virtually overnight. Not to mention being on that dose  of steroid for that long gave me two ulcers!\n\nLong story short I left that doctor and pursued a naturopath doctor for a few months. She took me off ALL medications and had me on a diet with no soy, no meat, no gluten, no citrus, no caffeine, no sugar, no processed food, no fried food, no fish, no beans, no nuts, no dairy, no bananas no nightshade vegetables. Not a fun way to live. Easy to say I dropped a ridiculous amount of weight and my pain and swelling did not improve. I left her too.\n\nI finally found the right Doctor when I returned to UCLA medical group which is where I went to college- go Bruins! And saw a rheumatologist there and when he did my blood work he discovered that I was wrongly diagnosed and of course embrel would be the wrong choice for me! He said if I could not tolerate the methotrexate then there were other choices. He hooked me up with xeljams ( i think that is how you spell it) and its as if I am back to normal ever since and I feel as if I have never been sick! I swear it is a miracle drug. I suffer from reynauds phenomenon primarily when I get cold otherwise there are no outward signs. I have small flairs every now and then but nothing like when I was on embrel. What are some of your guys experiences with getting diagnosed?", "Severe pain in right shoulder when breathing... anyone else? Ugh with MCTD I never know what to be concerned about. This pain could either be a serious life threatening issue or just a flare up of bursitis or tendinitis that is a serious pain in the...well, neck. I am used to chronic pain but for three days now I have had severe pain in my shoulder that starts shooting when I breathe... which I do relatively frequently. Not to mention I have not been able to get any sleep because the pain is doubled when laying down or even just tilting back past 90 degrees. My rheum once mentioned a condition where chest pain gets worse when lying down but I do not recall what she said about it since i did not have it at the time. Any suggestions or thoughts? I really do not want to show up at the doctor again only for them to tell me that \u201cit is likely due to some inflammation in the area so just keep and eye on it.\u201d As if I had not thought of that lol. My middle name is inflammation at this point! Appreciate any input from this group!! Thanks! I think you need to be seen, and sooner rather than later - like tonight. As you say, it might be a flare-up of some local musculoskeletal inflammation, but pleuritic chest pain (pain when you breathe) radiating to the shoulder absolutely can be a sign of a really serious condition like pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction (heart attack). Please go to an ER.\n\nEdit: Oh, and your doctor might have meant pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around your heart) that is worse when you lie down. I have had a couple of bouts with it - it can also cause pain similar to what you are describing.  Please go and get checked out. I know when you are used to being in pain, it is easy to dismiss things but when it comes to chest pain, you really should get it checked out. \nIs the chest pain central or does it feel like it is in your lungs? If it is central, my first thought is costochondritis (inflammation of the rib cartilage.) \n\nI have had it before and it is unpleasant but when I had it as a result of covid, there was just no way I could lie down to sleep. If I had not experienced it before, I could have seen why people think it is a heart attack! \n\nI hope it is something that can be easily resolved. How are you doing? Were you able to be seen? Hi, it was right before the holidays and with the high demand from Covid no one was doing any lab tests in my area (small town). So I chatted with my doctor from the city and they had me wait it out. If it got worse or if I felt like I needed I should go to ER. I waited and after a few more days my symptoms cleared so I never did go in. However, I do not think it is a symptom I can afford to take lightly (always have had a hunch that my gallbladder or liver was infected or at least inflamed and I think the shoulder pain was a wake up call. The phrenic nerve is located near those organs and spans all the way to your shoulder and if it is pinched from inflammation it can hurt anywhere along the nerve - which is what I believe was happening to me. I will be following up with my doctors and probably getting some scans done. Thanks for all your concern and advice. Sounds like pleurisy to me. I had it every night like clockwork when I was on nifedepine. Stopped the nifedepine, and it never really came back save for a few small flares that were nothing compared to what I was feeling nightly. Only thing that helped me get out of it was a prednisone taper. Also, seems counterintuitive, but lay on the side that it hurts on when and if it happens again. It does not help a ton, but it does help.", "Vaccination related MCTD? Hello all!\n\nI have no offical diagnosis of my condition, but for the last 6 weeks I have been having this sensation like I was wearing a jumpsuit all over my body that has a smaller size than mine. Gets worse at nigth (painsomnia), all my muscles feel sore,  fatigue and my skin got more sensitive too. I also have mild \"fevers\" ( 37-37.2 C\u00b0). My symptoms are directly linked to vaccination. \n\nI would like to know if u recommend FDM (fascia distortion model) or not. I have had a couple of sessions sofar and I am still not sure if it will help on the long term or it just does damage to my CTs :S\n\nFun Fact: I have been taking Xolair injections for the lat 5 years for asthma. In case you are wondering what the hell is a \"Xolair\", simply put it is a synthetic antibody that binds your bodys IgE.\n\nP.S.: here is a recent study I would like to share with you :) There are lots of things other than MCTD that could cause this. I am afraid it needs to have been going on for longer than six weeks before you will get a diagnosis. \nI think your next step needs to be seeing a rheumatologist for blood tests. Your best bet would be to talk to a rheumatologist. I am not familiar with the jumpsuit type pain description but I have had my disease for decades and am vaccinated. I didnt have any vaccine side effects but since you are experiencing something it is a good idea to get tested during this flare. That way they can identify what you are experiencing better. There is no indication of you having MCTD and also I am not sure that you have understood the study you linked and/or how antibodies work. Your therapy acts to bind IgE, essentially lowering their effective concentration. If the correlation they found in study does indeed exist in some people, your asthma med would be helping, not worsening  I am not an immunolgist or an MD myself (economist at best), but I had a break with my therapy for 3 months ( sry I forgot to mention it above)  because... Well... Because I was dumb enough to listen to my GP ( there are no indications or conntraindications... so it was kind of a wild guess from him, but again there is like zero relevant data available) \"My symptoms are directly linked to vaccination.\"\n\nHow can you tell? My symptoms developed a few days after I got vaccinated Just because A occured in time before B, does not mean that A caused B. \nYour statement is just an assumption. There might be a causal relationship, and there might not be. You are correct it is hypothesis indeed, backed by at least 3 different MDs. Yes ...they do not have clear evidence, but experience( not mine again, all the doctors I have meet had vaccinated hunrdreds of ppl during the last couple of months) tells long lasting side effect are not that uncommon official statments suggest. Vaccination ( or any medication in general) triggered autoimmune disease are a thing.\nPls do not get me wrong tho, I am NOT an antivax idiot myself. Vaccines are the most powerful and efficent  tool that modern medicine has given mankind. happy cake day my dude &gt;I am NOT an antivax idiot\n\nWell, that is good to know lol- glad you are not one of those idiots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also just like to mention, whilst I am here, that with any Vaccination I.e.: The Flu Shot, Covid Vaccine etc etc, basically in a nutshell the Vaccines target the Body's Immune System.  So, without reading too much in to your current situation, I feel that it is good to know *how* it affects ones body, etc. I am in the process of being diagnosed. I had blood drawn about a week after my second vaccination. My CRP came back 24 and I had RNA and SSA levels of 380 and 250. They did blood work again 2 weeks after that and my CRP was down to 7 and the other 2 levels were much lower but I cannot remember exactly what they were. Also, I suddenly started gaining weight and swelling about 12 hours after the first shot. It  finally leveled off about 3 months after. I got the second shot about a month after the weight gain stopped and have been steadily climbing again ever since for a total of nearly 20 pounds now since the first shot. I 100% believe it sent my auto immune system into overdrive. \nI am not anti-vax. My whole family is fully vaccinated including our 14 year old. Women are also know to have more side effects from vaccines because of the way they bind to estrogen.", "Recently diagnosed I was wondering if anyone has been diagnosed with connective tissue disease? I had a positive ANA test, confirmed raynauds and confirmed rheumatoid arthritis by blood test. After evaluation the rheumatologist believes it is connective tissue disorder. I have some days where I am really fatigue. My husband thinks it is an excuse and that the doc is a quack. Any advice out there?!?!? Your husband is being extremely insensitive. My MCTD started off as just feeling fatigued. Uncontrolled it got so bad my sister had to help brush my hair and shave my legs for me, with a whole plethora more symptoms. If your doctor is trying to help you, take the help. Dont let it get to the point where you are able to tell your husband \"I told you so\" it wont be worth it. I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been battling this? What  has helped for you? I was prescribed Hydroxychlor... and I am so afraid to take it because it commonly causes blindness. Blindness is not a common side effect. You need to get regular eye exams to make sure it is not doing damage, but it is a safe drug. Lots of us are on it for years with no issues. I have it, and my sister in law was recently diagnosed as well, which came as a shock to us. It started out as Reynauds and joint swelling for me and Reynauds + fatigue for her. \n\nI will be honest, things have not been easy with this condition. There are days (most of this week) where flare ups land me in bed and in need of a lot of help. I took plaquenil (hydroxychloriquine) for 5 months or so before switching to methotrexate and have had better results with that. It is a mangeable condition, but you need support from your doctor and your loved ones. \n\nYour husband needs to be educated - now and thoroughly. This shit is serious and it will impact your life. There were people in my life that did not understand either until I sat them down and gave them material to read on the disease and then explained how it was personally affecting me.\n\nYou will be okay. It is a tough road, but you have got this. Just make sure you find the support you need and advocate for yourself, always. Your post really helped me. Thank you for taking the time to reply. \n\nI have really bad swelling in the hands especially the joints on my pointer finger and middle finger. Both hands feel really stiff in the morning and evening hours. The Reynauds I have had since I was around 12. I have learned to use the hot packs and electric jackets to help retain the heat. Also hunting stores have good thermal protection wear. \n\nI did not know you could get flare ups with connective tissue disease. I was initially afraid of taking the hydroxychloriquine because of the side effects and I am already pretty blind as it is. My vision seems to always be changing and getting blurry so when my husband read that information, he kind of over reacted and freaked out. I currently do not drive at night because my vision is so bad. \n\nIt has been quite the journey, I am a little confused why my rheumatoid arthritis was not picked up on this recent blood draw but the ANA was positive and speckled (1:80 ratio). I am thankful we can support each other and give feedback about our own experiences. This seems pretty rare and kind of disregarded by people when you mention it. Thank you, is there any of advice you can offer? Are we more prone to getting lupus or scleroderma? I do have a family member with scleroderma so it just makes me pretty nervous. I think this is kind of big news to be diagnosed with. It is just hard to explain to other family members. I am honestly not sure about being at higher risk. Have you seen a rheumatologist yet? These are the sort of questions they will be able to answer.\nIt is natural to be nervous. The longer you have your diagnosis, the easier it gets and the less anxious you will feel.\nI recommend not Googling too much because it is so easy to end up making yourself more stressed and stress aggravates autoimmune problems.\n\nThis sub is not very active so you will probably get more support posting on r/Autoimmune or r/autoimmunity Yes, I have seen a Rheumatologist. That is who diagnosed my MCTD and said it seemed to favor lupus but could also be scleroderma. It is too early to tell at this point. I have also been advised that I can request for the anti-RNA polymerase III test... another  market for systemic sclerdomera if you were tested negative for the other diagnostic test the generally run for scleroderma. Maybe this information will help someone else out there searching for answers but the family member I am close to, tested negative for ANA and systemic sclerosis but the Anti-RNA Polymerase III was positive. This person was then diagnosed with scleroderma. My symptoms are mostly lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. My rheumatologist is debating referring me to a lupus specialist, although that does not mean I have lupus (if that makes sense)\n\nI would ask for the additional testing, especially if it would put your mind at ease. Did you test positive for a high anti-RNP antibody? Or do they just not quite have it narrowed down yet? Lupus, MCTD, scleroderma, etc are all connective tissue diseases. MCTD is just a specific one. Not that far yet, I see the Rhuem in 3 months but the Anti-RNA antibody was positive on a family member with scleroderma and negative all other results. This Rhuem said they had their own preliminary testing and that it would not matter. I was told MCTD is an umbrella term... interesting. Ah, ok. The hallmark of MCTD is a high anti-RNP antibody, but they are honestly all treated initially with hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). I hope it brings you relief soon! It honestly gave me quality of life back. I go for field of vision testing once yearly and my rheumatologist said that blindness will not occur if you keep up with your checks. Hey, just so you know hydroxychloroquine does cause eye damage if given in the wrong dose. It should be I believe less than 5mg per kg. I see an eye doctor every 6m to a year to review my eyes to make sure they are not being damaged. So it qont make you blind overnight but it can hurt your eyes. \n\nI have been on aziathoprene, methotrexate, cellcept, hydroxychloroquine, benlysta and rituxan. Currently I am on rituxan and hydroxychloroquine. And it seems to be doing pretty well. \n\nI was first diagnosed new years day 2015. It was really hard learning the diagnosis, and all the uncertainty that goes with it. I have had my share of issues with pulmonary fibrosis and myopericarditis. But I am in a really good place right now. When I was first diagnosed I thought as a single 23 year old my life was over. I thought I would always be a burden and who would ever want to marry me with all my issues, let alone start a family. I think I was def depressed aha.  \n\nIt is been a long road but I am happy to say I am now 28, married with a 3 month old son. The most important thing in my relationship is that my husband is so caring and understanding. He id behind me 100% &amp; doesnt question my illness one bit even though its invisible and on the inside. Its hard enough coping with your issues let alone trying to convince everyone that yes, indeed you are sick. And for that I am sooo grateful.\n\nThere are 2 things I will recommend to you for your journey\n\n1) BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE!\nI cant stress this enough!!!!! Doctors are humans. They mess up and make mistakes, it happens. But  if we dont catch something right away or arent able to suppress symptoms, we are the ones who experience the consequences. Not them. If you have a hunch, trust your gut and pursue it. Even if it means calling your doctors constantly, and being so persistent that you annoy them. It is your life and nobody is going to care about it as much as you do. Follow your own blood tests and try to always be one step ahead of your doctors. It helps prepare you and makes acceptance alot easier. \n\n2) EAT CLEAN!!\nI struggle with this I will have to admit. But the better you eat the better you will feel. If your body is using less of its energy to combat inflammation from the foods you eat, itll have a better time trying to make things right again in your body. Dr brooke goldner is a good resource if you want to get super serious about it. Also the philosophies behind True North Clinic in California has some great principles on how to make your body its healthiest. This includes things like a plant based diet, no refined sugars, lots of raw leafy greens, no gluten, omega 3's to help heal. Its daunting and hard to do,  I will be the first to admit. And I dont follow it all the time. Especially right now with covid. And Doctors will tell you our disease has nothing to do with diet. But I always feel my best when I am following a low inflammation diet. \n\nHope any of this helps, feem free to message me if you ever need someone to talk to 3 Hi again. \n\nI have MCTD, my diagnosis consists mostly of lupus &amp; scleroderma with some myositis. It is possible to have MCTD without RA. I have always had really sore joints in my hand and wrists and it has been caused by lupus inflammation, which is a non erosive inflammation as opposed to RA. If they do xrays or sometimes even a sonogram on your hands they should be able to distinguish the two. MCTD is the overlapping of these connective tissue disorders, meaning you have more than one Thank you so much! I will ask for that. My hands are so sore most the time and I have young children. It really does effect my hand mobility. Benadryl helps a lot at night if the ibuprofen does not kick in... I do not want to sound like a complainer but OMG. Maybe I should be taking this hydrochloric pill... I am still a little afraid... You should consider going on prednisone for a short course in order to get your symptoms under control. There are downsides to taking it, but it works like a hot damn. They dont call them satan's tic tacs for nothing Also hydroxychloroquine needs to build up in your system, so it works best I think on average 3 months after you first start taking it. So prednisone might help you get through it For me I was diagnosed at 9 got rheumatoid arthritis by 11 mostly lupus symptoms with flair ups with treatment of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate along with some other ones along the way. I would always had spots of scleroderma like my ankles, knees and wrists were hard to bend and skin was tighter and harder. At 20-21 the medications were not helping anymore and it became apparent that scleroderma was taking over. I stopped all medication and started mycophenalate. The scleroderma was much worse for me I was basically bedridden. I am managing it much better now but my point is your symptoms can change so it just depends on which disease you have more symptoms of. I am sorry you were diagnosed I wish you all the luck in the world. Just be grateful always because you never know what will happen. I had some hard times and after the last couple years I look back and think I was so stupid for not appreciating the things I was able to do at that time that I cannot do now. The symptoms overlap. It is its own specific disease though, the hallmark being that you MUST have a high anti-RNP antibody to be dx with it. It used to cause problems when given at the old dose of 800mg a day. But these days the common dose is 300 or 400mg a day for the same effect. Some people can even take 200mg once their disease is well managed.\n\n\u201cannual screening is recommended for everyone taking Plaquenil, it is imperative for people who have been taking the medication for more than 10 years, who have a higher incidence of retinal toxicity. Plaquenil-induced toxicity usually will not occur before five years of taking the drug.\u201d\n\n Yes. MCTD typically will develop overlapping diseases over time. To begin with, it is a disease made up from a combination of SLE (lupus), scleroderma, and polymyositis, with raynauds also being a common ailment. Some people like yourself also have RA.\nLater on you may develop other diseases of the autoimmune type. But I hope not! :) Yes. If you have a baseline and they check you yearly they can see quicker when you develop retina toxicity and can change your medication. Most people only stay on plaquenil for 5-10 years I believe. This is not entirely wrong and I do not know why you were downvoted. MCTD IS a combination of symptoms from three autoimmune diseases - SLE, scleroderma, and polymyositis.\n\n\u201cMixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by features commonly seen in three different connective tissue disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Some affected people may also have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.\u201d\n\n It is difficult for people who do not have an autoimmune disease to understand the symptoms, as they have a hard time relating to it. Husbands, mothers, and your kids, are the people who seem to have the hardest time understanding and relating.\n\nIn the beginning, my husband did not understand why I was always so tired. He got grumpy with me and thought I was milking it. After I had an official diagnosis and showed him actual concrete information, he was able to read and discover for himself that I was not faking it. If you already have a diagnosis and he is refusing to learn about a medical diagnosis his wife has then that is on him and he is being insensitive and selfish. Ask him to read about it on actual legit websites like john hopkins or mayo or cleveland clinic. Then ask him to try to be more understanding and accepting of your limitations. Thanks,\n\nMy rheumatologist explained MCTD as a Venn diagram. There being four overlapping circles representing lupus, RA, Scleroderma and myositis. Anyone with the diagnosis can fall anywhere within the diagram but it is very personal and unique to each case where you land. I liked the visuals of this idea and has helped me to understand it more That is a great way to mentally visualize it! :) It is very different for everyone. Ugh, I am having a really hard time with this and I do not want to put this type of stress on people that are close to me. My husband came home from work today and said that his Dad thinks I am just a really snappy and moody individual. I asked him, DID YOU TELL HIM WHAT I WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH? ...\n\nNO...\n \nI take care of our family, and my husband tames care of the finances. I just feel like this will slowly drag me back into a depression and I do not want that! I feel like I am dealing with a very toxic family who is not the least bit concerned! Wow, this a great visualization. Thank you for sharing this information. I think it can help in explaining to other family members. Wow.", "Noob to mctd Hello people of the internet.\n\nSo I have been going through these severe symptoms of extreme hair loss that I am almost balding, my fingers swell up from basically anything. Ranges from being in a cold environment, eating gluten and god forbid have alcohol.\n\nI already do have Hashimoto's but I realised my symptoms were too severe. Then came the inflammation and bone issues and then I was put on arthritis meds.\n\nHonestly, just tired. I am 24 and I have been living like an old person in pains and aches. Just want a virtual hug and be told it will be fine. Suggestions on lifestyle simple changes I can make are more than welcomed as honestly, I am tired of popping pills and waiting for the next side effect to be figured out slowly by me. Probably comes with spending a while being sick that you do not know if it is a side effect or a new symptom.\n\nThanks for letting me vent, feels good to be texting in a vaccum that actually makes me feel supported!", "Why would an unspecified multi-systemic rheumatological condition not fall under MCTD? So obviously everyone here is not a doctor but I know most people with a diagnosis have done a crap ton of research and been through the diagnostic process so maybe somebody can clarify something. \nSo right now I am undiagnosed but I take prednisone and hydroxychloroquine for what my rheum has pretty consistently referred to as \u201ca multi-systemic autoimmune disease\u201d which is not really a diagnosis and super frustrating because we know I have a bunch of autoantibodies and inflammation all over so clearly it is something but nobody seems to be able to tell me what it is. So the other day I go see my cardiologist and we are doing the typical recap of my history and my blood work and checking in on where I am at when he goes \u201cso you have scleroderma...\u201d and I interrupt because I do not have a scleroderma diagnosis or any hallmark symptoms other than the general fatigue etc. and the Scl-70. So he corrects and asks \u201coh so then you have MCTD\u201d and I am like nope my doctors told me I do not have MCTD and then he asks \u201cwhat do you have\u201d and I say \u201cmy rheum has not given me a diagnosis but he says it is something multi-systemic and autoimmune\u201d then my cardiologist says \u201cwell is not that exactly what MCTD is?\u201d And ya know what, is not it? \nI am just a little confused as to why at this point we have done all the tests available and I have blood results that confirm there is indeed a problem but I do not have any type of diagnosis. And MCTD seems to be kind of the catch-all for when you got several somethings but it is not really one or the other just kind of a muddled up mess. \nI just think it would help in my overall treatment if I could say to doctors oh I have MCTD or I have whatever and then they could proceed rather than do the whole explanation and have them just act lost like they do not know what to do with me. I know a diagnosis does not make everything magically better but I do know that they would just look it up rather than look at me like a crazy hypochondriac until my doctor faxes over 2yrs worth of blood work they do not really need to see but request so they can know what they are dealing with. \n\nSorry for the long post it is just, I dont understand. MCTD is now considered its own disease, diagnosable by the evidence of the U1-RNP antibodies and positive ANA (among the other typical symptoms: joint pain, swelling, organ involvement, etc.) If you do not have that antibody present in bloodwork I understand why your rheumatologist is unwilling to say it is MCTD specifically, but that has to be frustrating waiting for a diagnosis but having obvious autoimmune issues. \n\nBest of luck to you. Thanks for clarifying. I guess I should note that I also have the RNP antibodies they just do not stay as consistent as the  other ones. I am sorry to hear that, the volatility of blood work is ridiculous. How high is the RNP antibody titer? I believe it is characterized by a high indication of the antibody, not just some, as well. Mine was over 500 when I was first diagnosed, I want to say.", "I am so frustrated right now! Sorry if this is all over the place, it is more of a vent post.\n\nMy clinic has a training program so they have new doctor's finish their residency there for 1, 2 or 3 years then, most of the time, they go serve somewhere else. I have had about 3 doctor's before my current one (not to mention the many other doctor's outside the clinic I have seen) and I wish they stayed. I was not diagnosed until the end of my former doctor's residency, but they all tried hard to figure it out and help me out the best they could. This doctor, however, is not like that. I have had her for about 3 years now and she is nice and everything, but you can tell she does not know much about autoimmune disorders and she does not have a bedside manner of any kind, just mostly stoic. She likes to downplay my issues as something else and nothing to worry about, which may be true but I do not like to hear that I am \"fine\" when I do not feel \"fine.\" I do not think she does it on purpose, but still.\n\nSomething weird was going on with me a few weeks ago and after a week of symptoms getting worse (heart palpitations for no reason, tight feeling in chest, short breaths, increased fatigue, feeling the need to cough, increased joint pain in my knees, back pain galore, more rashes and a few others) I had an appointment with her via telehealth. I was asked if I had asthma, I said yes induced, she said do you have an inhaler, I said yes, she said maybe try that. I know what my asthma feels like, this is not it. I also have not had anything close to an asthma attack since I was like 13 and even then, it was because of activity or anxiety (which was more of a panic attack). I called a few days later to try to get a lung xray, but based off my symptoms the nurse wanted me to test for Covid, which came back negative. I figured it would cause I literally never leave my house, but I guess you never know.\n\nI feel like I always have to cross my fingers for her to actually say yes to testing. A couple months ago I got a few tests done, thankfully, and all were normal except one which was a little low, but not concerning. I wanted some more tests done because I came across some papers that showed some tests for the kidneys were extremely abnormal, which I never knew about. She said \"I do not think more testing is the answer right now.\" Even though I know I have MCTD (started at 11, diagnosed at 19), I do not know exactly what it is *mixed* with and that is concerning to me, especially since I have been feeling worse. So yes, I want to do anything and everything that might give me an answer. I am not one to complain about my problems so when I say somethings wrong, listen to me. I want a doctor who will tell me something I do not already know and will not brush my symptoms off as \"minor\" without even checking it out. \n\nI also want to see a rheumatologist because they have more experience in this field, but I do not have any insurance so I cannot afford the upfront payment. That is another reason why I am frustrated because I was waiting for my stimulus check so I can go see one just to find out the other day that I am not going to get one. I had made a mistake on my form I sent in and even though I later saw it and corrected it, they said they only accept the original form, not the updated one and that I was already deemed ineligible. I asked him why it let me update it and he said he did not know because the tool is run by a third party. He said there is nothing they can do and that I would have to wait till 2021 to refile. He even mentioned that he is sure there are others dealing with the same thing (if that is the case, should not you have something set up where we can fix it?) I have been waiting since May and I even called them back in August and all they said is to wait until December without even checking my form. Everytime I would sign in to see when it was going to be sent out, it would just say it was processing. If I was already ineligible, why did not it say that. \n\nI am so sick of dealing with people. I just want the world to pause, so I can have a break. I guess I am just tired of being stuck in the same situation I have been in for years. All symptoms, no answers. Sorry, vent over. My Rheum will look at my blood work and if my numbers are low, he says \u201cYou are doing fine!  See you in six months.\u201d  It does not matter my symptoms or pain, all he looks at is my numbers. It is incredibly frustrating. \n\nOh, almost forgot the best part. He tells me to exercise after I tell him that my joint symptoms have worsened...again. Lol I feel like my doctor's that way too, numbers seem fine so you must be fine. I hate when people say to exercise more or to drink more water, like do you think that will solve anything, like I will just be cured. I do not think exercising with more pain is a good idea anyway, lol. Like, I get it if I am sore or just stiff-stretching it out is good. But when it feels like I have got glass in my joints and they are throbbing-no. No I do not want to exercise, FUVM. \n\nMy main issue is the not listening. When I ask about new symptoms or \u201cHey, is it normal for more hair to be in my shower drain than on my head\u201d, do not brush me off like I am silly. This is frustrating, damn it. I have no idea what is going on sometimes and I do not know where it is coming from. Exactly. It is sad, but it is true.", "Knot on neck I am assuming a swollen lymph node, little tender when I touch it. Does this suggest an infection?", "Please Help! Pain management advice needed. My wife is 46 and was diagnosed with MCTD two years ago. She is having constant pain in her shoulder. She is tried going to a chiropractor and she got a month of temporary relief from a cortisone shot. I hate seeing her in pain and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. It is very nice to see a spouse of someone reaching out for help, it shows how much you care and understand! \n\nWhat medication is she on? She may be going through a flare up of disease activity and could benefit from prednisone, or it is time to change her medications. Unfortunately, with this disease it is not uncommon to always have pain to some degree and much of the struggle is learning to deal with it and find ways that help our individual pain. Thank you for taking the time to reply.  I will ask her tomorrow when she wakes up. I use Theraworx for muscle and joint pain its been a life saver. Good luck! Does she take any anti-inflammatory painkillers? It might not take the pain away completely, but it will be manageable. \n\nShe should definitely make an appointment with her doctor if she continues to be in pain. I am not sure I can offer much advice but I did want to share that I too have recently developed flares that come with extreme pain in any one of my joints to the point that I cannot use it. A couple weeks ago my shoulder suddenly started shooting with pain, I assumed it was just arthritis but then a few days later I was stretching it and it popped back into place and the pain stopped. I have not talked to my doctor about this yet so I have no idea if this is even a thing but I am wondering if we are more susceptible to partial dislocations? Look into myofascial release. My shoulders get very painful and oftentimes it is the muscles surrounding the joints that are the cause because they are so tight it is throwing the joint out of whack due to overcompensating. I go weekly and it is a relief. It is in a PT office here. My left shoulder has very limited range of motion, so I am now in the process with my chiropractor to fix it. It is not a fast process. I am very close to having frozen shoulder. Luckily, my insurance covers all of it. I also use a tennis ball against the wall, a vibrating massager and heating pad that goes over the shoulders that I got on Amazon. I cannot speak to meds except Advil or Aleve when needed. I am also on a Candida diet which reduces my yeast, which has been connected to contributing to inflammatory diseases.  I am not a doc, but these are the things that have worked for me. I also see a naturopathic doctor and we have disused my yeast issue and made diet changes. Good luck! I know exactly how she feels! I am 47 and just diagnosed in May, but dealing with symptoms for almost a year. She takes Plaquenil.  She was on Prednisone, but it interferes with some of her other required meds.  She also tried Methotrexate but it made her extremely itchy. That is rough, I am sorry :( She may benefit from massage therapy, alternating hot and cold, stretching, or more cortisol shots, but we cannot be sure ourselves. A bad flare can bring back bursitis issues I have had in the past. Finding an ART Myofascial Release therapist did wonders for my shoulder . It is a shame the guy moved away . As others have said, physiotherapy (and massage) in my case has been wonderful for both immediate respite and ongoing pain management-also shoulder dominant. I treat my lupus/mctd pain like any sporting injury - rest, stretches, and low weight medium rep exercises a few times a day. \n\nIf your wife can manage it, consider some light gym work with dumbells, being careful not to overdo it and cause a flair. I asked my PT for exercises for shoulder rehab and their suggestions were spot on - depending on your wife's symptoms they may also help? The first 10/15 mins can be tough and tight but then it gradually relaxes (sometimes!) . Could she get a referral for physio? I had physio last year for shoulder/elbow issues and it is been life changing. It is not perfect but it is so much better than it used to be and my arm does not lock up like it used to. \n\nMy understanding is that chiropractors really are not the best people to see. A physiotherapist can help establish exactly what is causing the pain and help with exercises to both strengthen the joint/muscles and relieve pain. A good physio should understand that chronic pain/chronic illness can be very limiting and they will work with her to find exercises she can manage. \n\nI find my TENs machine provides good pain relief, although when my skin is really sensitive, I cannot handle having the sticky pads touching me. Some people benefit from heat, others from cold and some alternate between the two. Pain management can be a case of trial and error to figure out what works for each person, or even for each body part in one person. Has her rheumatologist offered her an alternative to methotrexate like humira? Did they try some kind of antihistamine to see if she could stick with methotrexate?\n\nHow long has the shoulder pain been an issue and has she seen her GP/PCP because they may be able to prescribe a short term course of pain relief that is stronger than over the counter medication.\n\nIf she is using an over the counter med, it is really important that she takes it at regular intervals so that it works as well as possible. In all honesty, I have a pain management doctor. I tried acupuncture and everything else. I take Celebrex and Percocet which allows me to function. It is not ideal but I can exercise again which is good. Ditto on the chiropractor warning - connective tissue disease patients are contraindicated for chiropractic care. It can be very dangerous to us, in point of fact. Sounds like she may have a touch of osteoarthritis but before she gets an appointment, please consider getting her a new pillow - when you hear shoulder pain, think pillow issues. \n\nFwiw, I moderate two MCTD communities on FB. We hear this complaint a LOT. \n\nOtherwise, she can choose from hot packs, cold packs, TENS units, Lidocaine patches, Tramadol, etc. for pain as well as Medical Marijuana if available in your area. Yikes, I did not know that! Chiropractors are not as popular in the UK so I had no idea. Thanks for the warning! &gt;She has a newer down pillow.  Is there a specific pillow she should try? Did this new pillow coincide with her shoulder pain? Hot and cold therapy - although one might make it worse. For example, I have reynauds so cold therapy makes it worse for me. Movement and stretching reaaallly helps. Once I started doing yoga and working out again my inflammatory markers and muscle levels have normalized. Massage therapy also helps tremendously but make sure you find someone who is really knows what they are doing. Do not go to those cheapy Thai massage places. Those are not bad necessarily, it just will not really help her - in my opinion. \n\nI am a 500+ hour certified yoga teacher who specializes in restorative yoga. The yoga I teach and practice is designed to help with chronic pain like this. Contact me if you would like more info or maybe I can doo a zoom session with her or something. Ughhh I hate prednisone!! Wow methotrexate?? I am so sorry she is going through this. Like  said, myofascual release is amazing. It is helped me tremendously with my severe back pain.", "Article for the Community: UCTD, MCTD, and Overlap Syndromes in Rheumatology Reciting the symptoms of your illness to all of your doctors while simultaneously experiencing them is hard. Getting a diagnosis and actually understanding it can be even harder. This article covers some specifics on how your doctor can help you reach a diagnosis, the likelihood of developing certain symptoms, and symptom-based prognosis. \n\n\n( Thanks for sharing! Thanks, this is really interesting. I am so glad! You are welcome :) You are welcome!! Thanks for the feedback! It took me several years to get diagnosed because I had such a wide, non-specific collection of symptoms. Yea, I think many of us can relate. Did you have a chance to read this article? I ask because I am curious from your perspective if you think this information would have been helpful during the process of your diagnosis. It probably would not have been helpful in the process of my diagnosis because there were so many random symptoms that nobody could connect. It started out with skin rashes, dermatitis, and an ADHD diagnosis. Then, it proceeded to GI symptoms, Raynaud's phenomenon, significant brain fog, and muscle pain. Then, finally, joint pain and swelling started to be a real problem. This whole process took 10 years, and the first doctor that thought to test me for the anti-RNP antibody got it right.  \n\nHydroxychloroquine, good diet, not eating gluten, good sleep hygiene, and routine moderate intensity aerobic exercise have it pretty well under control. I should say that I am glad to see anyone posting about MCTD because it is probably great for helping other people get diagnosed.  If I had known the disease existed before getting the anti-RNP test, I would have probably been able to better steer my doctors to the right diagnosis.  I got sick of being told I did not have an autoimmune disorder because I am male and constantly learning what diseases I do not have (celiac, Crohn's, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) I appreciate all of the feedback and actually really needed to hear your \u201crecovery\u201d story. I am personally struggling with the \u201cgetting it under control\u201d phase. It is been an exhausting experience trying different things only to watch them fail. But I have hope especially when I hear that at your level of symptoms it is possible to get it relatively under control. Yeah, I thought I was literally going to die 5 years ago.  I could barely use a computer mouse, and I am an engineer.  Now, a month ago, I rode my road bike up the highest paved road in North America.  I was exhausted the next few days, but I was still functional.  Moving out to the Rockies from the desolate, miserable Upper Midwest helped a lot, too.  The sunshine, dry air, and lower pollution are all great.  It is still a huge hassle, but it is workable.", "Newly Diagnosed My fiance was just diagnosed and I am looking for some input from people who have experienced it. Her doctor has not been able to tell her much yet, but I am curious about the prognosis. The only consistent information I can find is that 80% live past 10 years of the diagnosis. But we are young and have a lot of life beyond 10 years. What are the statistics beyond that? Does this always end up being fatal? Sorry if this is not the right kind of thing to ask, I am just panicking at the moment Panic not needed.  That study can be read many ways, and one way is\u2026.it only lasted 10 years, and those people, were still alive when it ended.  MCTD has many faces, and most are not that scary.  I am nearly 73, and have lived with it for 45 years. I was terrified when I was first diagnosed and I read all the studies about the potential manifestations and the mortality rates. But the truth is that it is a disease that affects everyone differently, and I think most people walk around with it and are able to work and have a generally normal life. I was told by my rheumatologist that I should expect a normal or close to normal life expectancy.\n\nI have since been diagnosed with other major health problems that have way more impact on my day-to-day ability to function, and I have had two major surgeries. These have caused more disability and inconvenience than MCTD. Flare-ups are not fun, but at least I know to prepare for them and deal with them when they do. The major factor that affects my daily activities is fatigue, and I have adapted work and other tasks around this. I make sure to have time to nap when I need it, and I take a nap most days. This makes a big difference for me. \n\nI cannot promise you two where on the spectrum of disease she will fall, but the description of the disease you are probably reading is worst-case scenario. For most people, it is not a death sentence, or even something that will keep people from most of the activities they enjoys. The important thing is finding a good rheumatologist and figuring out the right treatment plan. I am only 2 years in, so I remember the panic. It was way scarier before I had the diagnosis. There are established, safe drugs that help with this and can be taken long term. Flare ups suck, but take her vitamin D religiously, sunscreen every time you go outside (there can be a skin component to MCTD) and get 7-8 hours of sleep on as many nights as possible to lessen chances. This is not really a disease that hastens death, it just makes you uncomfortable, and when untreated it hurts. If she has kidney/liver/digestive system involvement that adds complexity, but there are a lot of us that have minor cases. Thank you so much for your response. These real stories of hope are what you do not find online anywhere. Feel free to not answer if it is inappropriate to ask, but do you experience Raynaud's? I know it is pretty common with MCTD and has the possibility to require amputation. She is very worried about this as she has it, but I am not sure how rare the need for amputation really is Thank you for this, we need all the hopeful information we can get right now. Do you experience Raynaud's? We have heard scary things and I am unsure of how likely those extreme cases are Do you know what it looks like when MCTD affects the digestive system? She has some digestive issues but doctors have always said that it is just basic acid reflux and it is been pretty manageable. Now I am wondering if it is related to MCTD Pretty damned rare, and only in cases where there is no care.  I have had it for decades, and find that, in my climate, I can deal. \n1.  Get off the internet, except for sites like Mayo Clinic, and other high rated hospitals\n2.  Find what works for her, like knowing that 75% of your heat is lost through your head, and wear a hat in cold weather.\n3.  I have pocket warmers, gloves, scarves, etc, and do not let my core temp drop (especially in the freezer department of the grocery store)\n\nWhere do you live, and what specialists has your fianc\u00e9 consulted? We live in east Tennessee. Sometimes the winters can get a little cold but it is not usually too bad. Our concern comes from the fact that it never seems to be triggered by cold. She has anywhere between 5 and 10 \"episodes\" a day, even when she is completely warm all the time Does she have a rheumatologist and genetecist and other specialists?  What medicines is she on?  How severe are her episodes? She is been assigned a rheumatologist but her doctor and they are working on figuring out her treatment plan, so no medicine yet. Her episodes last around a minute or two before normal color returns. Sometimes after color returns it will get a little purple for a few seconds. Has she tried wearing a hat or a scarf?  That would give you a baseline for what might help.  I would also suggest that you get on a list for a psychiatrist (to prove to other doctors that it is not in your head), a gastroenterologist, and possible a pulmonologist.  Those takes time, and getting on the list will save time.  \n\nSometimes when I am in the grocery store, people ask me if I have been picking blueberries, because of my fingers.  If they return to normal quickly, it is a good thing. She has not really because it has happened just as regularly when it is 90 degrees outside so she does not think cold is the trigger, bit we will keep it in mind. That is interesting about the psychiatrist, we have not had an issue with any doctor not believing her. They are the ones who did the tests and looked at her symptoms and told her what was wrong That is puzzling.  I hope you can get answers.  And I am glad your doctors believe you both! I do have Raynaud's. I have had it for longer than I have had MCTD. I started having trouble with cold hands/feet when I was still a kid and had no idea what was going on. I ended up realizing I had Raynaud's when I was in school for medical training and learned about it in one of my classes. It was about another 15 years after that before I got diagnosed with MCTD, even though I had the malar rash and joint pain, and I strongly suspected I had lupus or something similar for many years before I was officially diagnosed. So I dealt with Raynaud's for about 30 years before I was diagnosed.\n\nMy Raynaud's is mild-moderate, and I have not had any dangerous episodes. It is mostly just really uncomfortable, and finding good gloves has been a monumental challenge. I usually have to wear gloves to type and work at my computer in the winter. I love to camp, but the Raynaud's does make it less than fun. I would say it is more a challenge than a threat to my health (for example, losing a digit), which I would say is true for most people with Raynaud's. I have had MCTD for 6 years.  A month ago, I climbed Torreys Peak in Colorado during a blizzard and had a blast doing it.  I tend to be achey and tired most of the time, but I manage to get things done, and symptoms have generally not progressed. Amlodipine is pretty safe and helps my raynaud's Intermittent prednisone, eating yogurt, and not eating gluten are the only things I know of that really touch my MCTD-related GI issues, which seem comparable to colitis.  I have had multiple endoscopies from both ends that found nothing wrong.  My latest GI doc says my MCTD is likely the cause of my issues, which include gut pain, intermittent diarrhea, gluten intolerance, nausea, ...  If anyone has figured out anything better, please update! That sounds exactly how she is too. We will look into avoiding gluten. Thank you so much for all of your responses. It is comforting to hear from people who are maintaining a high quality of life", "Trying to add these to my previous post. I do not see an option(?)  So \n\nDid she not run a urine test?\n\nI do not know how she can for sure rule out the edema as being unrelated to autoimmune disease when she has no diagnosis for you yet.\n\nYou look like you tested negative for sjogrens\nBut if you read up on the other positive results they point to SLE, sjogrens, mctd, etc. but it looks like you can rule the sjogrens out.\nNot sure why she is ruling out lupus without urine analysis \ud83e\uddd0 \nDid she say why? \u201cWhen fluid builds in the body it is called edema, which means swelling. Swelling caused by lupus usually appears in the feet, ankles, legs, and eyelids, but may occur across the whole body. Edema can be a sign of a more serious condition, lupus nephritis.\u201d\n\nThis is why I keep returning to the edema\n\nBasically when nephritis occurs there is kidney damage. It is no bueno. I am shocked she is not treating that more seriously Thank you, I agree. Both legs have swelling but the right calf has been up to 4 inches bigger around than the left and the right thigh up to NINE inches bigger. I have been worried about it and thought for sure this stuff would explain it but she said it is not from it\n I am going to schedule with my primary care Dr ASAP too. \nWould the kidney problem show up on bloodwork?\nI noticed my bun creatinine ratio was 23 which is the top number listed as normal range and saw that other labs only go up to 20 before calling it elevated.\nMy Rheum did not do a urine test but i had one about 2 months ago somewhere else and I had ketone level of at 15. They said that only a trace amount and not to worry but it has always bren 0 before. 4 inches is the the same distance as 0.15 replica Bilbo from The Lord of the Rings' Sting Swords. She did not day She just said it is not. That was after the first set of labs on Aug 2. I have talked to her since the results camein on my second set. \nSo, do you think the Sjornes is out since it was so low on the second set of labs even though it was way over the normal limit on the first set of labs?\nThat was confusing me. I have had chronic dry eyes and swollen tender salivary glands under my chin for several years but always dismissed by other doctors as allergies or dry mouth and for the eye dryness, i was told it is chronic dry eye from Lasik Surgery but I wondered if the other doctors just werent putting the bigger picture together since they are all separate.\nI do also wonder about Lupus since it runs on my mom's side of the family but she kept saying she was leaning Spondyloarthritis but still figuring out which one. Also, my fatigue is debilitating almost everyday. I can barely work. I can only work a couple of hours. I sleep SEVERAL hours til it is time to pick my son up from school each day. It is rediculous. I am literally painfully tired. Well I know lupus does have a genetic component and that doctors are always afraid to diagnose lupus until its the last option. Lupus is coined the great imitator and has a ton of weird symptoms. Sometimes they do not fall into any other category. Mctd itself is just an umbrella term that kind of encompasses autoimmune symptoms from multiple diseases. A urine test would be a really good idea though and I am boggled she did not order one. Definitely go see your normal md and maybe even a second opinion somewhere. I am definitely going to see my regular doc and get a second opinion from a Rheumatologist. I will try the Taltz in the meanwhile I guess bcuz I need to halt the joint damage. Looked at that taltz and it looks like it is primarily used for psoriatic arthritis And AS. I am interested in whether it helps you. Can you give me updates periodically? It is a biological so there was some stuff about being able to get infection easier. I do not know how that affects things like catching covid. I think I saw you said you got vaccinated already. I am really interested in how you fare though!!! Yes, I will definitely keep you updated!!\nI know, I was shocked to be put on something so quick so I know she is thinking it is definitely something serious. I just sent an email ti the the office telling them I want answers BEFORE my next appt which is at the end of October. I will let you know what I hear back! \n I am fully vaccinated. Had the whole family done. I had a strong reaction, especially after the second shot. I was miserable for days lol. I am planning to muster up the energy to go get a flu shot before starting the Taltz.\nI hate to be getting on it during a pandemic lol...Especially, because my husband works in a crowded warehouse and my teen son is in school and he cannot wear a mask due to his own personal and medical issues so we will see lol.... Oof no mask during delta.. hopefully all his classmates wear theirs. Good luck \ud83c\udf40 it is so scary right now. Thanks, I know but he is special needs and has a medical exemption. I think he is the only one who does not wear one in the entire school and he does not walk the halls to change classes at regular time to avoid the crowd and he eats lunch alone. I am SO SO thankful that he is even able to attend this year after being stuck on virtual last year since his previous school did not make any exceptions on the masks. \nThank you so much too and take care!", "Muscle weakness So I was diagnosed with MCTD in May after 9 months of symptoms. I am not typical. I did not have years of issues/missed diagnoses, etc., that many have dealt with in their lives. I have muscle soreness, tightness and weakness in my shoulders and back. I cannot lift myself off the floor or shift in my bed because I do not have the strength. For those that have the same or have experienced the same, did you get any of your strength back? And how? I do work out with weights but very light ones because I cannot lift the heavy stuff anymore. I am not on any pharmaceuticals (for now, but would consider them if I could get my strength back.) Thank you! Going gluten free definitely helped all of that.  Here is some other stuff that seems to help me:\n- hydroxychloroquine\n- gradually increasing moderate intensity aerobic exercise (e.g. swimming, biking, hiking, kayaking).  Going long is ok, but high intensity is bad\n- staying inside on bad air quality days\n- turmeric supplements\n- occasionally using cannabis\n- CoQ10 supplements\n- yogurt\n- other fermented foods\n\nBad things:\n- outdoor exercise on bad pollution days\n- intense exercise (e.g. weight lifting)\n- bad sleep habits I am no where near as strong as I was, but I have regained a reasonable amount of strength. Hydroxychloroquine has given me back a decent quality of life; I am not well, but when my rheumatologist tried halving my dose for six months, I felt so unwell and weak, it made me realise how much better I am on the full dose. Glucosamine and naproxen have also helped.\nI use resistance bands because I find I am too wobbly for yoga (I get random bouts of vertigo) so being able to anchor the bands to a door and vary the weights depending on how I am feeling is really helpful.\n\nDo not over exert yourself and build up your exercise levels very, very slowly. I had to start at a minute at a time and was told to wait weeks before building up to five minutes. Take it really slowly and do not progress to longer periods of exercise until you are not finishing a session feeling weak or overly fatigued. It takes time but I was incredibly lucky to see a CFS who really understand pain, weakness and fatigue.\n\nI think you really need to speak to someone about some kind of medication because it really can be life changing. I am getting to that point. I am losing a lot of hair too. I worked out 7 days a week before this and I was up to heavy weights. I want my muscle tone and strength back to at least be able to shift myself with my arms in bed or get up off the floor. \n\nI see my rheumatoid doc in a few weeks. I will be talking to her about it for sure!\n\nThanks for your response! I have done every single elimination diet. No dairy, gluten, no yeast, and nothing seems to help. I am on a ton of supplements as well. I went the naturopathic route first. And I have done everything she is had me do for the past 6 months. And nothing seems to be helping or making any major improvements. \n\nI agree with you, good night sleep is best. I do not always sleep well. And I have noticed my symptoms improve slightly for a week before I ovulate, but not sure there is any correlation. I am just getting frustrated with my lack of progress despite trying to do all the \u201cright\u201d things and not running to pharmaceuticals right away (not that there is anything wrong with that, but it is not my personality to do that) but I am seriously thinking of starting.\n\nThanks for your response! Muscle tone is something I really miss. I sympathise with the hairloss, too. FYI, hydroxychloroquine is a synthetic version of the active ingredient from \n\nMany of the best prescription medications that we have are derivative of or synthetic versions of plant-based medicines. Thanks, that is very true. I have just always prided myself for not needing to take any drugs. For anything. Even child birth. And here I am considering it - it is just an idea I have to get used to and not to mention the side affects. IDK, maybe I have been led to believe (from whatever sources, websites, other people, etc) they are so horrible and worse than the disease. I just think I need a good night sleep tonight! \ud83e\udd23 I second/third what others have said about hydroxychloroquine. It is not as toxic as a lot of the recent media reports would lead you to believe, especially at levels to treat lupus/MCTD. You just have to be really careful about your eyes, so make sure you get regular check-ups. I have also had no luck with elimination diets, and I am struggling to find what triggers my autoimmune/inflammatory response. I have to rely on meds. But HCQ can definitely improve muscle loss. It did for me. Though, I have been struggling again lately and had to go up on my dose. I work out every day and have always been active as well. I have just had a disease day today. Everything has bothered me about my disease today, I am normally very positive but we all have our days. I do appreciate your post though, it is nice (weirdly) knowing others can relate. I think you are  right - recent reports have me scared I guess. And the low dosages, that is true too. \n\nIt is just not my nature to even think that way. But then again, I have not ever been diagnosed with a chronic disease either! I will speak to my docs about it. I can deal with the pain (mostly) because I can move, use heat/ice even the occasional Advil, etc. but the other stuff I cannot do crap about - except pharmaceuticals. \n\nThanks for the reality check! I have been on hydroxychloroquine for five years with zero side effects, and it is cheap. That is really good to know! And I am glad that you are finding relief from it! Thank you!! I hope tomorrow is gentler on you than today. As you said, we all have those days, but it does not make it any less miserable when it all gets on top of you.\nSometimes it just takes too much energy - emotional and physical - to be positive all the time, and that is OK. \nThis seems like a really friendly community so there will be plenty of support if you need to vent. Hey, just wanted to agree with you how frustrating this all is! Your progression almost mimics mine, intense shoulder pain and so on. I was super sporty, dancing, powerlifting.\n\nContrary to what others have said here, I found weightlifting helpful. I started back at a much lower intensity but making progress, just under cooking it all the time. Doing more body building type workouts with dumbbells as opposed to pure strength could maybe help you build up the muscles that are not as sore, whilst avoiding the painful areas, perhaps? Thank you! I know we all have our own journeys and this space is nice because we can all relate to the same things. \n\nI like lifting weights and I do feel it helps me feel better. I do not even need to lift super heavy anymore but I just want to be able to regain \u201csome\u201d of my upper body strength back. I can still do all of my activities (tennis, working out, chores, etc) but can be limited due to my lack of strength. \n\nI see my rheumatoid doc in 10 days. I will be discussing pharmaceuticals with her. \n\nYes! I started with pain in both shoulders. Then the swollen wrists and fingers. I have the sausage fingers sometimes! And this past few months the muscle pain just got very bad. Tightness, very knotty, like I have  worked out for 100 hours. I have mild pain in my knees too but good range of motion. I have problems with putting on a bra or a jacket, anything that I have to reach behind to do. It is just my new normal! \n\nThanks for listening! We are all here for each other! Thank you! I am feeling better, both mentally and physically today! I did sleep better as well. I do not know anyone with MCTD and it is good for me to know of there who can relate. I hope we all stay healthy! Yep, last Sept I was at my physiotherapist twice a week with horrible shoulder pain, thought it was a lifting injury. Then my knees and hips were sore, I had to shower for 20 mins just to be able to move in the morning. But I did not think much of it, I was a a powerlifter, these things happen! Then the reynauds and sausage fingers started. A few strange rashes, terrible neck pain like knots everywhere, heartburn. But again could all be consistent with sporting injures or hard training. After a while I could not close my hands, they were almost frozen. That is when I decided to go to the doc and they were like yes your antibodies are all over the place!\n\nOur symptoms are almost textbook MCTD from what I can gather. Keep moving. Keep exercising. It is a big metal effort sometimes but I know I *always* feel better after lifting, not worse. Its a bit of motivation. Longer warmups and lots of stretching seems to prepare the body well. I probably will never be able to bench press again, overhead press or do anything that I need to reach up or behind but I kind of come to terms with it. It is shit but I think it tends to be a more stable disease than lupus so hopefully symptoms will be more predictable. Keep at it! My doc said I was textbook MCTD too! Which is so crazy because folks suffer for years and years with unexplained symptoms and missed diagnoses with Autoimmune things. I find myself lucky to  NOT have gone through a lifetime of pain and doctors not listening, etc. \n\nI have been reading more about HCQ and how everything I have read say it is side effects are mild and usually go away after awhile. And folks taking it are so happy they did and any side effect far outweighs the dealing with the disease. I have decided to ask the doc for the RX and have it filled. So many people in this thread have brought up great points for taking it. Now I just worry if I can get it, due to the HCQ corona virus (non) relationship. It does not help that our president says he is taking it which creates a rush to get it by folks who believe him, and in my state the governor has allowed doctors to prescribe it for Covid (removing a ban on it placed by medical professionals to allow folks like us to continue to have access to it). Despite having no real concrete proof it helps with Covid. It is all so ironic. I really cannot do a thing but laugh about it \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nThank you! My life is more full knowing I am not alone and others understand! How long has your strength been lost? I have had flare ups where for like a year I had no strength and then out of nowhere, with no warning it just let up. Also, have been on prednisone and methotrexate and that did the same thing in terms of bringing on remission for me. Note that I do not have a diagnosis, or at the time my diagnosis was Scleroderma (later ruled out, then confirmed, then ruled out again, lol, welcome to autoimmune issues). I have had weakness for the past 8 months. I have been diagnosed officially since May, but symptoms for a year. I have Reynauds\u2019s for almost 20 years. \n\nI am leaning towards taking HCQ for weakness, hair loss and general well being. Although my symptoms are very mild, it is frustrating when I cannot do simple tasks around the house because I do not have the strength to do so. I am not asking to be able to lift 200 pounds, just to be able to open a jar without asking for help! \n\nI must be in a flare because I have had no relief for a year.\n\nI am sorry you have had such a hard time getting a diagnosis. I have an excellent rheumatoid doctor and an excellent naturopathic doctor as well. I hope you find some answers soon! I am really glad you are feeling better! Thank you! Usually it is just a day or 1/2 a day then I get through it. I have been sleeping better the past few nights so that helps too!", "Diagnosed months ago- still confused I was diagnosed with a mild case of MCTD- mainly lupus, CREST, and sjorgrens. In addition, I also have celiac disease. I am still confused as to what MCTD is, and how to separate all my symptoms. I am always very tired, I have mild cold/flu-like symptoms, headaches, and I always feel like something is just off about how I feel. I never feel fully well. I have been on plaquenil for a year now, but not much improvement. Any suggestions?  I forgot to add I have a lot of problems with dry mouth and eyes. I am constantly thirsty and cannot seem to drink enough water I read that sugar free chewing gum has shown some help in keeping your mouth from drying out, but other than that, I think your rheumatologist is best equipped to help you out. I do not have any Sjrogen's symptoms at present so I cannot help you much. Sorry! The never fully feeling well could definitely be the MCTD. Joint pain, muscle pain, Raynaud's, etc are all common symptoms of MCTD but symptoms are so widly varied it is hard to determine what is what. I find keeping a daily symptom diary helps me determine what is normal and what is from my MCTD. I was diagnosed almost seven years ago. So far I have not found much for help. The doctors in my area are terrible and we just got a rheumatologist in the area that I can see. I am also allergic to every med they have tried on me so far. The best thing I have found to help my flares come less often had been a vegetarian diet. I have been vegetarian for a little more than a year and it has helped with fatigue and stomach issues I have as well as made my flares come less and become more mild. Try different diets because I know everyone is different, it might help and even a little relief is something! I do not have suggestions, just support.\n\nMy MCTD seems to be lupus and scleroderma, do not know what else yet, if anything. On top of that I have fibro, which has symptoms similar to my lupus symptoms. I can mostly tell them apart because I was diagnosed after being around lots of UV lighting at work, and when I am in the sun too much (or at all really) certain symptoms act up so I figure they are my lupus symptoms, and other times it is all over not well. \n(BTW - Do not subject yourself to the sun, it will make you worse, I am just sharing my experience.) Oh! I have a reply for this. (I have a family member with Sjogrens.) \n\nFor dry mouth she and i both recommend ACT brand mints/lozenges. \n\nThe person I mentioned uses refresh brand eye drops, and (per what she is told me) suggests using the lowest moisturizing ones possible. Hi! I was diagnosed about 9-10 months ago and I am also struggling to find what is normal and what is not so normal. \n\nI have a lot of ra involvement as well as polymyositis systems when the weather gets hot. Tests positive for lupus but personally I do not *feel* any symptoms. Esophageal dysfunction with frozen liquids when consumed too fast (my esophagus closes and it feels like my lungs freeze and I cannot breathe). Raynaud's is my party trick. \n\nWhat I have learned is to listen to your body. Start getting stiff? Stretch. I do not want to say the typical \"do yoga\" but find stretches that slowly help with your stiffest spots. Mine are my hips. I stand on one foot with my arms stretched out and my other leg extended behind me and I slowly stretch down. I look like an airplane landing but honestly all of my joints crack and it feels ~wonderful~\n\nBefore I started showing symptoms I actually completely lost my taste for meat. I did not like it. Not even the smell. Chicken was okay sometimes. But truly, the past few months I have been feeling much better and I have moved to a protein-based diet. \nI love junk food. Especially sugar. Oooh, oreos are one of my favs. \nBut since decreasing my sugar intake, I have had rid of my brain fog and have little to no pain and what I like to think of as \"movement induced flares\" have subsided as long as I maintain my diet. \nWhat I mean by movement induced flares is... just that. If I push myself too far, lift too many heavy things... run around like a nut and not delegate at work, my body would essentially just freak out. I would have flare pains until I stopped what I was doing and sit down and drink about two liters of water. And just breathe. \n\nAnd alcohol... I love it. Okay, I love everything that is bad for a person... booze... cheeseburgers.... fried EVERYTHING. Ugh. \nBut since cutting my alcohol consumption, it is also helped my pain. Probably because my meds work better.. lol. \n\nAny questions let me know!!! ", "A good rheumatologist but has no belief in MCTD as an AI So I had an appt today with my new Rheumatologist.  We must have sat there for an hour talking about my symptoms and he listened to me.  He definitely thinks I have something. It might sjogrens lupus or even scleroderma.  It Is interesting because my previous test with other rheumatologists showed a super high RNP which I thought may have possibly pointed to MCTD.  My next appointment is on the 9th of December. I think I will leave that appointment with an actual diagnosis but I have really no clue what it will be if it is not MCTD.  The doctor was going to prescribe me plaquenil, but we decided to have a couple more tests just to be sure of a diagnosis.\n\nQuestion: Have you ever met a rheumatologist that does not think that MCTD is in actual autoimmune disease and that the symptoms can be categorized to fit a non-overlapping AI? My rheumatologist considers it as more of a place-holding diagnostic code while she is determining the \"actual\" diagnosis, but did say it may always stay at this. \n\nMy bloodwork goes all over the place. Fwiw, whenever I have run into a rheumy like that, they have turned out to be a complete shit of a rheumy. \n\nBest of luck! He thinks I do have something so I feel pretty good about it. Thanks. Luck to you also. I have. The worst thing was that the rheumatology nurse I saw to help manage my fatigue did believe in it, believed me and believed my diagnosis from a different consultant. \nThis rheumatologist did not check my bloods for a year and then dismissed me as having fibro and CFS when I already had a diagnosis of MCTD. \n\nMy current consultant periodically takes time off to do other work and despite not liking him or trusting him at first, I will either wait for him to get back or request a different doctor from the one who told me it was \"just\" fibro. Wow. That sucks. Glad you found someone who takes you seriously. I hope my rheumatologist  follows this rationale if he diagnose anything definitive. Yes, I have had problems with rheumys knowing what is up. Here is my diagnosis story:\n\nMy GP thought I likely had Lupus. Ran bloodwork positive for ANA and something else, and sent me to rheum. He believed (even though my mom had Lupus) I had Sjogrens. Sent me to a Sjogren\u2019s research clinic, which dx me as Partial Sjogrens. Back to rheum, who said I did not necc have Lupus, even though my bloodwork and symptoms and family history made that likely. \n\nWe moved. I found a new GP, who had an interest in rheumatology. She diagnosed me with Unspecified CTD and started me on Plaquenil. I decided to go to the Mayo Clinic to see a real specialist, since the wait for a rheum is so long where I live. After a full week there of testing (and bringing previous results and talking about symptoms), I left with a firm diagnosis of MCTD. \n\nWhen I got into my new and very young rheum here at home, he dismissed the dx and told me he believes I instead have RA (which my father has). I am not too fond of him, but I still see him. Eventually I will find a new doctor. I think it is quite brazen to dismiss the expertise of a Mayo Clinic dr with 35 years experience.  Thanks I will read. I have read some literature that says some rheumatologist do not think it is a permanent  diagnosis. Science does that I guess. I will definitely follow up with what my doctor says on the 9th. My tentative understanding is that MCTD _is_ a distinct, persistent autoimmune disease. Ok", "What has been your biggest struggle since being diagnosed? Whether it would be managing symptoms or managing others\u2019 expectations, what has/have been the thing(s) you have struggled with the most? Actually, getting a rheum that initiates treatment for the underlying cause (my immune system).\n\nI had to realize that if you have a disease that does not give you arthritis and crass organ involvement, you are neither given ressources for pain management nor immunosuppressants.\n\nI do have organ involvement in my lungs (reduced diffusion rate with no visible fibrosis), recognised in April. Meaning, this is a sensitive marker of arteries in the lung thickening from the disease, leading to Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, which is the most dangerous aspect of MCTD, statistically.\nSonography only showed mildly elevated PAH, but that method is not very reliable.\n\nMy first rheum would not even give the right amount of HCQ, the second one totally brushed off my lung involvement (with your mild symptoms, you should totally be fine with sports only!). Only with the third (special clinic), I feel they will finally push for right heart catheter to check for PAH and then, maybe, there might be possibilities to stop my body from continuing to thicken my lung arteries, I hope. Oh Jesus H. Is that why I keep running out of breath? I need to ask about this. I have symptoms that are far more disturbing, I tend to focus on those because they will kill me faster. I was diagnosed so late and I am so sick, I think they have written me off.\n\nTo answer your question, my greatest challenge is pain management. It is absolutely fucking brutal, and I am furious that they will not give me good drugs. Tobecleari do not say \"hey man can I have some good drugs doc\". They are afraid it will cause me to die faster. Here is the thing: FUCK YOU DOC HOW ABOUT WHAT I WANT. I will take one good year over five years of slowly dying in great pain. Why is not the choice mine? It annoys me a LOT. There are many reasons you could be out of breath but with MCTD, a lung check at the pulmonologist is absolutely not out of place. It is also still very relative what you define as \"dangerous\" bc MCTD is still really not that deadly.\n\nMy first rheum took it seriously when I mentioned chronic non-productive cough. I had the usual things first like chest x-ray, a throrax-CT and then, at the pulmonologist, lung capacity measurement and CO diffusion rate measurement.\n\nI am sorry you have many more pain issues and are still not taken seriously :( My most serious issue now is that I am missing a number of layers of skin inside of my mouth. The inside of my cheeks, my gums, even under my tongue have very few places left with any skin in them and in some places it goes deep. I can barely eat and they keep taking me off if prednisone, which is the only thing that seems to help. I get scripts for lidocaine mouthwash, which I have to limit myself on because it seems to affect my heart. I have been on a soft food diet for months now. No one knows why and no one gives a shit but me.  It is damned frustrating. I am so sorry :(\n\nThe only thing I can imagine helping is changing doctors, pushing and hopefully finding one that wants to help... \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Doing that very thing today. I will continue to fight. Being rural and without a car complicates things, but I will get it handled. Luckily there is one other rheumatologist in my general area.\n\nIt is hard not to give up after a while when you feel so unheard. But I was never that good at shutting up anyway, which does help. I can raise my voice one more time indeed. Eventually, I may find who I need I have to try. I am dropping weight fast and it hurts so much. It burns. I also barf a number of times a day (they do not know why, it is been going on for four years now) which does not help. I am not in good shape. There is a lot. I will hush with that. I have a lot wrong and I am only still here because I am stubborn af. Wow, I am so sorry that you have had to live like this for so long. And I am extremely furious with your doctors for not pushing to figure out a solution to at least find you some peace. Out of curiosity, have you been to see a functional doctor? I only ask because I have seen my best friend go through something similar for years and recently found some (not 100%) relief after going to a very good functional doctor who addressed some of the underlying issues not just the symptoms. My friend now takes some very natural supplements (after doing infusions for years and being on and off prednisone etc.). The supplements have made the flares fewer and farther between. Just before COVID I had gone to see one myself and she actually listened to me! There were things I had sensed about my hormone fluctuations that my doctors had always just shrugged off but she seemed to be actually concerned that they could be a huge part of why my body seems off balance. I am still pending results of some hormone and other tests but I have a good feeling about it. I noticed that functional doctors tend to be more concerned with you and how you feel than the average doctor so it might be worth a try. I cannot imagine what you are going through but I am proud of you for fighting for yourself! Hang in there please! Also, not sure if you have the energy to do so but there is a wonderful book (also on audiobook) written by a medical doctor who developed an autoimmune disease. Being a doctor herself gave her a unique perspective of the patient experience. She realizes that Western Medicine has its limitations and starts using her knowledge of the human body to dig deeper and understand her condition from the perspective of functional medicine. Now, she is back at work but has moved into the field of functional medicine. It is very inspiring and it walks you through how she managed to pull herself out of a very disruptive autoimmune disease. The book is called ( I have not been flaring for awhile so my symptoms are mostly nonexistent. When I do flare I never know which symptoms I will have or how long they will last. One thing that is CONSTANTLY a struggle is fatigue. My days with extreme fatigue are more frequent than my normal days when the brain fog lifts. My biggest struggle currently is my friends, partner, coworkers and family all know about my diagnosis but none of them understand that I am so so so tired alllll the time. One task feels like enough for the entire day. I do not call in to work or anything for it and I would like to think I am great at my job but my coworkers do not get why I am always exhausted. You are such a lovely person. I have never heard of functional doctors but I will pursue this indeed. I am grateful for your compassion. I am unable to say how large this feels to me. Just, thank you. \u2764\ufe0f You are very welcome. I truly do hope you can find some relief. We are here for you Definitely check out the book I posted to our sub. Your struggle sounds just like the authors! Might even be a good book for your loved ones to read if they want to understand what you are going through. Thanks! I will look into it. Symptoms are so much better than they used to be I tend to kind of forget about/downplay it... meds have made me so sick I just do not take them anymore but I am always looking for tricks to boost energy. Newly diagnosed (?).  The question mark because my rheumatologist is not 100% sure. But I guess that is pretty typical for those going through blood test after blood test for answers for autoimmune disease.   \nThat is the biggest struggle- not knowing why my body is failing me and feeling that all of my efforts are failing as well (clean eating, solid sleep, meds, supplements, etc...)   \nAdded to this is not knowing what part of me will be less-functional each day.   \nThis morning I woke up and could not put pressure/walk on my right foot/ankle. Yesterday it was fine. I feel like I could use a cane right about now. I have had a hand flare for about 5 months now and migrating flares throughout my body. I just want to know how to deal with the daily changes and levels of ability. I feel like I have no support and am doing this all on my own-- but I do not even know what I am dealing with. Overwhelming at best. None of the above even existed 8 months ago. \n\n  \n\\*Background: I have MS, work a full time job and a part time job, started flaring last year in one finger and then within months all fingers have been in a constant flair.   \nOn daily a low dose of prednisone and 200mg of Hydroxychloriquine daily. Please note that \"functional medicine\" is not in all aspects evidence based.  \nIt encompasses disproven and outdated practices.\n\n(\n\nI mean, no one judges you for turning to it. But you should know that this is no real alternative to evidence based medicine.", "Expanding on Yesterday's Poll: How intense are your average daily symptoms? Brining some more context to yesterday's poll, let us look at how our community rates their daily symptoms. If you were to think of the last 6 months, on average, how have you felt daily?\n\n( Wow! 8-9, whoever you are... what is your secret? Lol I read the poll backwards before I chose. I think we are all used to the pain scale being 1-10 Oh, sorry for the confusion! I can see now why you thought that!! I am an 8-9! I started weight lifting 3 days per week, cardio 2 days, and resting the other 2 days. It is been a real life changer. Do not get me wrong - I am exhausted after the workouts and really had to fight through fatigue for the first month, but I feel so much better now. My joints do not hurt quite as bad anymore (still taking Plaquenil and meloxicam daily). I have even lost 20 lbs since the end of May, which is nearly unheard of for me. 20 lbs is 9.08 kg I think this scale is really confusing bc it is completely opposed to the way pain scales work... \nbut on first glimpse and read-through, it appears to be a pain scale.\n\nSo I accidentally answered according to that.\n\nIdk how you can solve that - maybe delete and redo? But nevermind, it is just a suggestion. Can confirm. Consistent, weekly cardio (spinning or rowing is my preferred) and resistance training has made an enormous impact on my health both physically and mentally. I would even make the argument that it is even more important for us as compared to the general public because exercise stimulates synovial fluid production, among other reasons. You are right! That is my bad. Unfortunately reddit does not all you to change poll posts. I have considered taking it down and redoing it but I would hate to lose it. However, I will repost a new poll to regather more accurate data. Sorry for the confusion. And thanks for the feedback! I will repost the poll and ask people to vote again so we can have a more accurate data set! Thanks for the feedback", "So i spoke to my Dr about plaquenil and how it is making me feel. And he took me off it already. Put me back on leflunomide and dropped the dosage to 10mg instead of 20mg.\n \nLeflunomide was making me feel great and I feel the nausea and dizziness for the next 4-5 weeks was going to be hard", "How do MTCD symptoms differ from lupus? I recently we had what doctors are saying was a lupus flare. It was the first one I had. But it attacked my tendons and not my joints, I have an underlying disease called Arthrogryposis which caused me to be born with very shorts tendons. I had to have tendons lengthened so I could walk or use hands. \n\nBut since m tendons were already so tight that when the attack happened it tore many of them. I tore both Achilles and flexor tendons on both ankles and feet. It also tore tendons in my wrist, so I have been thinking I may have mtcd instead of lupus.   Just curious if anyone has an opinion, I have mctd and my tendons are being attacked right now... I think it is possible with lupus and mctd...\nWhat do you mean by they are torn ? Are they destroyed? Do you get new one ? MCTD has a specific antibody associated with it that indicates MCTD instead of other autoimmune diseases with their own unique antibodies. My pain is felt as stabbing, squeezing and stiffness. I have bits of RA, lupus and polymyositis. Dx with MCTD 3.5 years ago. MCTD is very rare but can be diagnosed with a blood test. To be dx with MCTD, you have to have a high anti-RNP antibody. Well it tore both Achilles but did not rupture them. The surgeon is hoping there is enough tissue left to allow them to heal. If not I will need cadaver tendon graphed in. It also tore my flexor tendons on both feet and hands. But same story they are not ruptured all the way there is some tissue still connected. Hopefully everything will continue to heal.   My worry is another flare of whatever hit me happens again and this time it will rupture them. \n\nMy feet swelled to twice there size along with my knees and hands. I was given different meds nothing worked until I took prednisone. Then it got better. So I have something auto-immune, the dr says lupus but I am thinking it may be MTCD.   Do you have swelling like that with your flares? Yes I know there is the RNP anti-body that is MTCD indicator. I have been bedridden and not able to go for more testing. So far they said I had a one indicator for lupus and another that was negative, I was also negative for RA. But I have been told I have RA for the last 20 years. So I do not know what is happening to me, The one thing I know for sure is I have something. My symptoms were horrific and incredibly severe. My limbs swelled to grotesque portions.  The EMT that helped at first thought it was swelling from a rattle snake bite. Where they have to slice the skin open to to relieve tension or it will tear.   So I am just trying to make sense of all this. \n\nThanks for replying Yes I know there is the RNP anti-body that is MTCD indicator. I have been bedridden and not able to go for more testing.

I get the malar rash associated with SLE but generally do not get it at the same time that I get RA symptoms. I find it harder to differentiate between the lupus like symptoms and the polymyositis like symptoms.\n\nI already had tendon issues well before I started to develop any other symptoms so I honestly do not know what is an old archery injury flaring up or what is a new MCTD symptom when it comes to my tendons. \n\nIt is been a few months since my tendons have really bothered me but when they do, it is a burning pain. It feels like they are being wound tighter and tighter and it is like I can feel them fraying under the strain. \n\nIt is something you really need to speak to your rheumatologist about; being an overlap condition, it seems a bit more variable than some other autoimmune issues.", "Pictures of finger infections I have had These are individual finger infections I have had I thought I would share.\n\nI have Mixed Connective Tissue Disease with Secondary Raynauds.\n\nWarning: kind of gross.\n\n(\n\nDo not let the smiling deceive you, lots of pain. :) I have had horrible skin and nail infections myself where they get black and bloody underneath the nail bed.

I offer you the best advice I have based on having this nearly 20 years - you find the treatments (preventative, Flare support, etc.) that your medical team can provide that works for you and you do your best to comply with them. It will take awhile. I cannot even begin to tell you the special hell that is FINDING the treatments that work in the right combo for you. Sometimes the meds will cause problems - they have meds for that, too. From hair loss to nausea. Remember, your joints and organs are what you are fighting for. \n\nAnd you stick to that treatment once you find it. It will need adjusting over the years. \n\nWhen you have Flares, you manage best you can, with kindness to yourself. If they go on a few days, you call in and get a prescription for Methylprednisolone or shot of Kenalog. If you are getting too many Flares, you go back and find another treatment regiment. \n\nGet clear about your medical goals - mine are vision, mobility, quality of life. \n\nTalk that over with your doctors and get working on what that means for your treatment. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. You are most welcome. Thank you SO much for sharing and taking the time to type this out for me. I would love to keep up with you and stay in touch. I am actually currently looking for a van to spruce up. I am planning on hitting as many national parks as possible. This was great advice and I am glad you found something that works for you. I am always happy to talk van life and spoony life. \n\nDo not get me wrong tho, van life is extremely difficult given my health conditions. Chronic pain, back injury, mental health residue. And I offload a lot of personal growth through acting the symbolism of looking like a free person to those I meet. My life is full of masks and I care more about living my purpose than finding myself and living for me. \n\nI am happy to see if we connect but I will earn you I am in the middle of my van build and until March first I may not be super responsive. \n\nBut reply or pm me and we will see what happens. Ask me anything. \n\n-Luna", "New Here and Waiting on Diagnosis Hi everyone. I recently went to my primary doctor due to having leg pain and I believed I had R.A. My doctor did some blood work and I came back with ana titer 1:16, speckled pattern and 3.0 for RNP (positive). She referred me to a Rheumatologist, thinks it is MCTD and I have my first appointment in March.\n \nHere are my symptoms:\n-Nodules on my knuckles\n-Fatigue\n-Leg pain, hip pain, really pain in my bones and all over\n-Joint pain\n-Trouble swallowing \n-Shortness of breath/heart feels like it is racing. \n\nThat last one I am nervous about. Now that I have been reading about this I read about pulmonary hypertension and have freaked myself out. I made an appointment for tomorrow (was just told last week I may have MCTD so they will think I am crazy) but I need peace of mind. When they did my blood work they did a comprehensive metabolic panel and it all came back normal. \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!", "Poll for the Community: How many hours of sleep do you need per night to feel \u201cnormal\u201d? \n\n( To get 8 hours of actual sleep I need to be in bed at least 9 hours.

I find that if I do not drink enough water, I have a lot more muscle pain and various other problems -- e.g. urinary tract pain.  If I drink water late at night, that is counterproductive because of having to get up to pee, but if I remember to drink it during the day, that is generally when I feel my best.  I feel best if I drink about 80 oz per day of mostly water with some green or herbal tea.", "MCTD and Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome? Happy holidays! I am in the process of exploring more about my health (aka not sweeping it under the rug anymore) and have learned that I have MCTD. I see the rheumatologist next month to dig deeper into that. I am lucky enough to have an amazing PCP who was able to put all my symptoms together and run all the right labs.\n\nHowever, my whole life I have had blood sugar issues. This is the one thing that does not quite fit nicely into the MCTD symptom umbrella like everything else. So I saw an endocrinologist last week. We know I have reactive hypoglycemia. I eat sugar, my blood glucose plummets. I manage by strict diet and everything is usually fine\u2026 until I slip up and have the audacity to have some gummy worms while wrapping Christmas gifts and then kick myself when my glucose is 42 a couple hours later. \n\nSo this new endocrinologist suspects Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome. She ran some labs and will be ordering a mixed meal test to confirm and get more info. She also said that autoimmune diseases can occur together, so it all makes sense. \n\nHas anyone ever heard of IAS and MCTD occurring together? In my case, the IAS would have come first (if it turns out that is the cause of the lifelong reactive hypoglycemia.)", "Newly diagnosed - But is it correct? TLDR: My story and what the Rheumo says  \nI am 44yo WM and I have been having strange symptoms starting at the end of September. \n\nNarrative: It started in late September after a very mentally, physically, and emotionally charged weekend - Obstacle Course Racing World Championships; in a colder climate  than I was ready for. I started having mild flu-like symptoms (fatigue, cold sensitivity, loss of appetite). By mid-October the night sweats started. I also developed red splotches on my trunk and legs that are now only on my legs. My groin nodes are a little swollen, but not very large, and not tender. In the last 2 weeks I have developed pitting edema above my ankles. The edema and the night sweats are the only things really being an issue.\n\nPhysical: 5-10, 157. Resting HR is about 55-60. Since this started I continued doing an obstacle course race once every 2 weeks. I have felt good enough to run about 15 miles a week. I am recovering from a right partial rotator cuff tear. I have lost some muscle mass with the loss of appetite. At the Dr a few days ago, he reported lungs were \"crystal clear,\" and no strange heart noises. - Let me repeat: I run obstacle course races every 2 weeks since this started (successfully) and do training runs and workouts 4 days out of the week in between races. I am very physically active. \n\nMedication: Naltrexone 50mg, that was recently cut to 25mg. When I do not take the med, the symptoms are worse. Supplements I take occasionally: Ginger, turmeric, THC-free CBD gels, potassium, zinc, selenium.\n\nHistory of: sleep apnea (treated with a mouthpiece), high LDL (but my HDL is high, Triglycerides are low, and CHOL/HDL ratio is 4.6). All other blood work (RNP was elevated), thyroid, kidney function show elevated creatinine and benign idiopathic hematuria (per a previous urologist visit), liver function are normal. No HIV,Hep, or other STDs. I already had Covid last December and am not vaxxed.\n\nMy PCP seems to think the elevated RNP may point to a rheumatologic issue. I do not have any other symptoms that point that direction. He is also ruled out lymph issues because my bloodwork (including platelets and leukocytes) have come back normal, and the nodes are not very large though swollen.\n\nThe Rheumotologist based my MCTD diagnosis off of that 1 blood test, not considering most the the physical stress I have been in since late September - even though I asked her if this is just an acute systemic stress response - and a rash on my legs.  She referred me to a nephrologist because of the elevated creatinine and hematuria, and put me on \"hydroxychlor\" and prednisone.  No other tests, no trying less drastic measures. She told me no strenuous activity, when I have got a 10 mile Tough Mudder in 2 days. \n\n  \nI am sorry, but I feel fine and I disagree with the practice of \"Oh you show symptoms and tests. Let us put you on meds for life, instead of fixing the underlying problem.\" I had a similar negative experience with a nephrologist in my 20s. If I had listened to him my life would have been ruined - no kids and no firefighting career. So, yes, I am a bit of a skeptic. Was your ANA also elevated? I was diagnosed based on my symptoms (lupus like) and my bloodwork also but, I had RNP and ANA. Usually they need both for a diagnosis. I take hcq and prednisone and it seems to work. I only take the prednisone for a flare. I seem to tolerate the hcq just fine except for loss of appetite. Do not dismiss the blood work.  Internal changes may be happening (loss of esophageal motility, etc).  Look at this chart, and get a few more tests.  Put together a list of specialists that would evaluate the further tests.  My initial symptoms were dismissed and ignored and I am not sure treatment would have changed anything, since this was before biologicals.  \n\nAlso, this\u2026. \n\nI have had a diagnosis for 35+ years, and have not had to change my lifestyle, but do need to allow some recovery time for stress.\n\nPick up the book \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score \u201c, if it sounds pertinent.  It is eye-opening.\n\nAnd keep posting.  We would like to know how you are doing. High titer RNP is the hallmark of MCTD. Especially if you are already on Naltrexone and are still showing positive RNP. You do not mention what specialist prescribed the Naltrexone or for what diagnosis. \n\nHydroxychloroquine is the first baseline medication for connective tissue autoimmune diseases like MCTD and many of it is component diseases, like RA. It may help with the edema and night sweats, which are pretty common for inflammatory autoimmune diseases like MCTD. \n\nI am a bit concerned at your \"instead of fixing the underlying problem\" remark. Treatment is fixing the underlying problem, fwiw. Medications like Hydroxychloroquine help modulate our misdirected immune systems so they are not mistakenly oriented to attack our own cells. That is the very definition of \"fixing the underlying problem\". \n\nAdditionally, you may be showing auto-antibodies given your Covid. Covid vaccination would go a long way to resetting your immune system against this, so that is always an option here if you are not interested in the HCQ and Prednisone treatment as a first protocol. Yes it was. That showed up first then they decided to draw more blood and found the RNP elevated. Thank you. I am in the process of putting all the labs together I am getting (I also have to have blood work for a work physical and I went to a men's health clinic when this all started and they drew blood).  I am noticing that what is considered \"acceptable range\" for lab values varies within the same lab. One test I am in the safe range, the other test I am 0.1 out of it. The underlying problem, to me, is answering, \"What causes this to set off in the first place? Stress? Naltrexone?  Over-training for races? Imbalanced diet?  Rapid weight loss due to loss of appetite as a side effect of Naltrexone? Previous alcohol abuse?\"    \nThe Nal is a 50mg dose to reduce alcohol cravings.   \n\n\nWithout getting into a debate over the details of the Covid vax, I am pretty sure injecting myself with something that is going to cause an immune response is not what I need right now.  I was over Covid by Dec 27, 2020 (with no residual effects - I ran 2 miles a few days after my symptoms stopped).  This started up 10 months later. I get your hypothesis but I am going to have to take  hard pass on that one. 2 miles is 3.22 km I would think the diagnosis would be correct but, I am not a dr.  That is just my opinion , for what it is worth. Good bot Generally speaking autoimmune diseases are caused by a combination of factors - genetic propensity, gateway infection, ACES trauma score/environmental triggers, etc.\n\nEvery Board of Rheumatology has strongly recommended that AI patients receive the Covid vax, given we have an alarming tendency towards severe Covid requiring hospitalization, vent and ECMO. As I type, I have an AI friend with MCTD who insisted (against medical advice) that her MCTD was too fragile to get vaxed and is now on a vent who is not expected to successfully come off it. The GoFundMe from her family is a literal sadder but wiser HCA in the making. \n\nThe Acquired Immune system is literally built to continuously create antibodies against our environment by causing immune responses. This happens daily, as we interact with our environment. Which is precisely how vaccination works by shortcutting through this process to \"download\" antibodies into our innate immune system. \n\nYou make a very strong point to assure us how very physically active you are, as if to make an argument that protects you against autoimmune diseases or that automatically contraindicates against autoimmune disease. This is not accurate. Professional athletes have been diagnosed with AI disease. So unfortunately, given you currently have an MCTD dx, that is a \"enjoy it while you have it\" scenario. Failure to take steps to protect your health at this stage will rob you of health, functionality and possibly mobility down the line. At present, you are in the mild stages, from the sounds of it. Severe MCTD looks very, very different - it can include ILD, mobility devices, organ failure, and morbidity. \n\nThat said, you may be now seeing the beginning of what is called Post-Covid Syndrome. (\n\nIn any case, you do not appear to be very interested in any information that falls outside of your own viewpoint. And so I will sign off. I point out my health to show that I am active and healthy for a 44yo.  That is all I am saying. Any more is conjecture on the part of the reader.  \n\nAs I get a second opinion and look over more recent lab numbers, it appears that the rheumatologist may be off. \n\n\"In any case, you do not appear to be very interested in any information that falls outside of your own viewpoint.\"   -- So we have something in common then. I am 29 with positive ANA titer. Was seriously active until last two years. Was benching 350 plus two years ago and now cannot even get over tennis elbow. I got Covid and also was not vaccinated due to how healthy I eat I got over it in a days time. That said, my joints from running Marathons and lifting like a mad man have come to a complete halt. I am taking this very serious and going to lots of doctors for a diagnosis. As someone who maybe brought down by my own ego, I would advise you do not do the same. If I would have gotten blood tests years back when I had off/on knee swelling maybe I would have known and would not have pushed myself so hard. I am paying for it. Take the DX serious.", "Seizure like generalized muscle pain? Dear community, I have been diagnosed with MCTD for almost 3 years now. Every once in a while I wake up in the middle of the night with chills and fever, followed by muscle pain the next day in almost every muscle for the following two days. It feels like being sore after a really intense workout and it is accompanied by flu-like symptoms. I wonder if this a common symptom of the condition or something else that needs to be looked into, i.e. myositis - though I\u2018v read these can be one of the many faces of MCTD. Has anyone else affected experienced something similar? Hi there, I had these symptoms before starting treatment and even now I get milder fevers at night that keep me awake - less often with muscle pain these days but with fatigue. Not much else to add other than letting you know that you are not alone. Yes, when it happens the muscle pain is now limited mostly to my legs and shoulders. It is generally a warning sign that I am starting to flare. I have been getting this same exact thing too. It radiates through my legs and arms and sometimes neck and it feels like a tender, striking, numbing pain and the chills are horrible! Fevers up to 104F and Ive had infections and everything else ruled out. Im on gabapentin 300 tid now bc they think it is neuropathic pain- I just started so it is hard to tell if it is working. Gaba is a tough drug. It takes a bit to work and in the meantime makes you stupid tired until you build a tolerance. It also causes sexual side effects including making it insanely difficult to orgasm.. I got off it after a year. Took a while to get back to normal. Have you already talked to your rheum about this?\n\nHopefully, they can try to work on medication/treatment or refer you further.\n\nOtherwise, muscle pain really is no stranger to MCTD - like the other commenters already stated. Yea I have def been more tired and bc I have been more tired less desire for sex or anything else for that matter\ud83d\ude05 have you tried other meds that worked for this type of pain? Also thanks for your input. No. I think they all typically do the same thing side effect wise. I was taking it for sciatica when I had a ruptured disk in my spine. I just got tired of the sexual side effects more than anything. :/ and being tired all the time. Like even with a build up of tolerance I was still tired often. But no longer falling asleep during the day etc. Yes, I have talked to him about it. Did not spark much attention though. Guess it just comes with the package\u2026 Thank you for mentioning this. I have been on gabapentin for neurological and muscle issues and nobody warned me about this. I had no idea where my drive went! I just assumed it was part of the crushing fatigue from either the drug or MCTD itself. I also have trouble cutting it back because I get terrible insomnia without it now. It not only reduces your drive but reduces sensitivity and makes it difficult to orgasm. \n\nYou can try using sleep aids like unisom to wean off if you are having trouble sleeping, but definitely talk to your doctor first and come up with a plan for weaning off it or find out if you can do cold turkey etc. do not just do something you read on reddit :) if you are having side effects that are too much for your quality of life talk to your doctor!! I have a lot of muscle pain and spasms as well. It is not usually accompanied by fever but you are right that myositis absolutely includes these symptoms. I will do that. My husband will appreciate your advice!!! Hahhaa i bet he will ;) mine appreciated me getting off it Lol Update for everyone: Rheum says that is a very common symptom of MCTD. There was also a slightly increased CK in my latest blood work also pointing in the direction of myositis. So that is going to be flagged.", "Success with POTS symptoms? Has anyone had any luck improving their POTS symptoms?", "(Part 1) Poll for the Community: Have you had Covid? The talk of the town: Covid-19. Most of us are on high alert, isolating, wearing masks, and washing our hands... a lot! It is a scary time for everyone but uniquely so for those of us with an autoimmune condition. I would like to hear from the community if anyone has been exposed to Covid or even recovered from it. Knowing how our community has fared through the ongoing pandemic may provide some perspective and put some minds at ease. \n\n\\**Covid-19 discussions can be highly political and emotionally charged, let us remember to keep the conversation supportive and health-focused for our fellow Mixies - thank you! Happy polling!*\n\n( My GP is pretty sure I have had it, unfortunately in late March, only people who needed hospital treatment were being tested.\nMy rheumatologist has ordered an antibody test which I am due to have on Tuesday, so fingers crossed we will know for sure fairly soon.\nI have just been given the go ahead to donate blood again for the first time in years, so I almost hope I have had it so that if I have antibodies, they will be able to help someone who is struggling. I live in Canada, so only about 1% of the population has had COVID according to our mass antibody testing we did in July. I have not been directly exposed, potentially only some cousins who I have not seen since Christmas may have had it in March. Still uncertain.\n\nI do have friends and family in the UK who have been directly impacted though. SIL and her family suspects they had it in March. Friend tested positive for it in May. They are in and around London which expects about 10% of the population was infected.", "What to ask doctors? I do not have a diagnosis, but from my own research, some sort of connective tissue disorder sounds likely.\n\n  \nMy question is, what should I be asking doctors for test wise to get a firm diagnosis? I do not have a GP/Family dr, so I only have access to walk in clinics where you get a 6 minute time slot at most (which is generally shortened).   I need to go in with a plan of \"please send me for Xyz testing\", otherwise nothing will happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy symptoms/existing conditions:  \n\\-psoriasis  \n\\-very inflexible, and always have been.\n\n\\-any sort of injury takes ages to heal, if it ever even does : I hurt my left knee (slipped disc essentially) when I was around 12, got physiotherapy for it, and it has only recently been back to normal most days. I am almost 27.  I over stretched my hamstring 5 years ago, and it has never healed, even with physio/RMT. I have multiple vertebrae that are not herniated, but are very irritated and painful... 5 years for this as well, and no real relief except with a chiropractor, and that does not last.  \n\n\\-soft teeth, prone to cavities.\n\n\\-quite swollen, non-painful lymph nodes behind my left ear at the base of my skull. Years and years now, doctors have brushed it off as temporary and nothing to worry about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would just love to be able to put a name to what is happening... in my gut I feel like something is wrong and not normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else have similar stories? Regarding the swollen lymph nodes, I had them from 14 years old and still have them at 25. I definitely think it is related.\n\nAt any rate, ask for an ANA panel. There are some people with autoimmune diseases that have negative ANA\u2019s which complicates things a lot but if you can get a positive there it is like a foot in the door. From there they can determine what antibodies you have specifically and narrow down the list of diseases you may have.\n\nA normal CBC should also include Rheumatoid Factor and CRP which are typically elevated with this disease(mine are not usually elevated though, so YMMV).\n\nI hope you get answers and best of luck!", "Gut problems and antidepressants For many years now, I have had gut problems that mostly consist of pain, poorly formed stools, mucus and stools, and occasional diarrhea. The pain is really the biggest problem because it keeps me from sleeping, which of course compounds and causes other problems, snowballing out of control. 6 years ago when I got diagnosed with MCTD, I had hoped all this gut stuff would work itself out, but it is recently gotten bad enough that I went in to get a colonoscopy, expecting to have some sort of inflammatory bowel disorder.  Unfortunately, they did not find any thing that suggests a specific diagnosis, but there was inflammation that might be characteristic of having a connective tissue disease. The colonoscopy sure sucks to go through for the lack of information it provided.\n\nAt this point, I am thinking I would like to try an anti-depressant to see if it helps the gut pain.  I have tried citalopram, and it definitely helped anxiety and depression, but it caused sexual dysfunction, severe gut pain, and diarrhea.  Wellbutrin did not help much of anything and caused gut pain. Amitriptyline did not help anything at all, made me irritable, and made me have a lot of trouble concentrating.  The only one that I have not tried that is appealing is mirtazapine.  Any thoughts on this would be welcome. Caffiene was the culprit for me. It also caused arthritis which went away after I stopped Caffiene intake. Like no caffeine at all? Yup. I stopped all caffeine intake. I had to stop gradually to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Caffeine is problematic for me, too. I can have a little when I am feeling well but if I am feeling at all run down,  there is no way I could handle it. \nMembers of the nightshade family are another trigger for me. Have you been checked for gallstones, ulcers or cancer by chance? Pretty sure the colonoscopy would have caught the first two, and I think the pain is not coming from the right place to be gallstones.  Thanks for the ideas, though! I would suggest trying these, I found they were great ", "Symptom/inquiry/test results Back in 2014 I told my military doctor that I had this roving kind of muscle pain. It would start in day my right calf and then move to say my left tricep. He ordered ANA, ESR, RA, and one other I can not recall. \n\nANA - positive (higher than normal)\nSm - negative\nDs dna - &lt;16\nSsa - negative \nSsb - negative\nRNP - positive\n(All others negative)\n\nRA - negative\nESR - 1\n\nSo he referred me to internal medicine and she said a lot of people had high RNP and it does not mean anything. \n\nFast forward to 2015, I wind up in the hospital with community acquired pneumonia and Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura at 27 y/o. I am male by the way. They did every test imaginable it seemed (I can get details if it will help) and my ESR was 43. Once I recovered I never felt 100%. \n\nFast forward to 2016 and I am dealing with joint issues. Arthritis at 28 in my spine. I am told to keep doing physical activity as that is the best for arthritis. Mind you I am still getting weird muscle pain but I just say it is normal and continue on with life. \n\nFast forward to today, I was kicked out of the military for a slew of issues. Disc degenerative disease in cervical and lumbar spine, migraines, C5-6 pushing on spinal cord, sciatica, major depression, anxiety, fatigue, GERD, radiculopathy among a few other things. \n\nI had an initial visit with my new doctor since I got out and brought the high ANA results to his attention and asked for his opinion. He agreed without question and asked if I wanted to see what it was today. So he ordered metabolic panel, CBC, ANA, A1C w/EAG, lipid, and IFA RA Diag. Pnl w/reflex Titer/Pat ( I think this will get me the X:XXX ratio?)\n\nDoes this follow somewhat with MCTD based off your experiences?  I am just looking for ideas or things to think about/opinions. \n\nMy current symptoms are:\nDDD\nArthritis\nMuscle pain\nJoint pain\nFatigue (I can sleep 10-12 hours if I do not set an alarm but usually wake up with a splitting headache. I just figured I was not a morning person. I can take a nap shortly after I wake up but I have been limiting myself to 8 hours and trying not to take a nap. I can also sleep after drinking an energy drink like nothing happened.)\nMigraines\nMemory fog/lack of focus\n\n\nMy mom has an autoimmune issue. No firm diagnosis after 7 years. She has muscle pain, intense headaches, constant canker sores, and high inflammation. One of my aunts has fibromyalgia confirmed through a blood test and IgA deficient. I still have to talk to one aunt. \n\nHow did things pan out for you?  What were your first symptoms?  From what I have read, the only things that point to MCTD is the high RNP which I understand is not conclusive and the other symptoms reflect a number of common ailments, but the high RNP and HSP have me curious. \n\nPlease, feel free to point me in another direction if I am off the mark. If you want more test results I will pull them for you. \n\nThank you all! Wow, I am really sorry about all of that and the fact you have not been taken seriously. \n\nMy first symptoms were also muscle and joint pain, along with Raynaud\u2019s. I had an ANA of 1:1280 and RNP of 1:500 something. It has since changed to a diagnosis of MCTD with SLE, as I had DS-DNA positive titers with the RNP this past year.  That was enough for a diagnosis of MCTD. With your slew of issues and overlap of symptoms, it is quite possible you have MCTD, especially because you have the RNP and physical symptoms.\n\nI really hope those results come back and that doctor gets you in to a specialist quickly. Who knows what kind of damage you may have from the inflammation and you really should be on some sort of disease mitigating medications. I hope so too. I doubt a rheumatologist will take me seriously if the RNP comes back high because I do not have glaring symptoms like raynaud\u2019s or sjogrens, and that is okay. It is not going to change anything. I am still going to be in pain and I can ask for steroids occasionally to get a few good days throughout the year. \n\nI set my expectations low and I hope that I can get some help to just mitigate and manage the symptoms. My story has a lot of similarities. Fatigue, roving muscle pain and DDD. Family history of arthritis. Mental health issues. Low positive ANA with positive RNP, that my rheumatologist said points to MCTD. But after severe lifestyle changes, my ANA is not currently positive. And my symptoms are improving, or at least I can identify most triggers. I guess my diagnosis is more likely fibromyalgia. \n\nIt would be nice to have a definitive diagnosis, but the fact is I have to find a way to live with these symptoms, and the only thing a MCTD diagnosis will get me is maybe some immunosuppressants. Sure I want to monitor my inflammation markers in case anything changes, but in the meantime I am learning how my body works so I can carve out a life between flares. \n\nI started with diet. Celiac runs in my family, so I quit gluten. Things got a little better so I did an elimination diet and cut out dairy and nightshades. Things improved more. \n\nI exercised. I had disc surgery nearly 4 years ago and exercise was hard at first. I could barely walk before the surgery, barely make it around the block shortly after, today I can hike for a couple hours. I do yoga. I lost 70 lbs. \n\nI went to therapy. Change is hard and you need all the support you can get. I still struggle with stress as a trigger, but am working on a meditation practice to hopefully better manage. \n\nThese are all things doctors will tell you to do: lose weight, eat right, get quality sleep/rest. What they do not tell you is HOW and that is the hard part; there are as many different hows as there are people suffering. Intelligent professionals can help guide you, I have found functional/integrative medicine to make the most sense. Good luck on Your journey. I am so sorry to hear that you have been struggling with this and no answers for so long. I know how draining it can be to know that something is wrong but no one else seems to believe you enough to push for answers. \nI cannot say for sure if you have MCTD but it does sound like autoimmune. A few things I would say is try eating intuitively. Clean diet with no processed foods or sugars is a really good start to helping your body not fight itself for no reason. Also, I tried green smoothies every day for a couple months and noticed that it actually helped space out my flares. On top of the smoothie I made sure to get 9 hours of sleep per day. Or 8 and a nap. While waiting for answers maybe give these simple things a shot to see if you cannot cool the inflammation. Good luck! Check back in! The family tried meatless for a week and we all felt better. It was not night and day but I did feel a slight difference. Two days ago I had Taco Bell and let me tell you, I feel like crap!\n\nMy wife has ankylosing spondylitis and had been off her meds due to covid fear since she is medical and I am no where near as swollen as her. In comparison to her, I feel like my aches and pains are a part of daily life but as I sit here the arches in my feet feel like cramping and I was only on my feet to take a shower today. I do not think that is normal. But like you said, food helped, surprisingly. \n\nI do not know what it is, and I do not want it but if it is something I just want to know how I can mitigate it. That is all. Such is life. \n\nThank you for the advise. Hex my kex What do you mean? Hey OP, any update? RA, CCP, ANA all came back negative!\n\nSo, I think I am going to fall back, go see pain management and get the occasional steroid shot for some relief. \n\nThanks for asking. I am sorry you do not have any answers still. I hope you find a pain management regiment that works for you and can give you your life back again. Good luck! Thank you. Good luck to you and everyone else who is going through this.", "MCTD or UCTD Question Hey all, I was recently diagnosed with UCTD but whenever my rheumatologist talks to me she calls it MCTD. My blood tests were indicative of MCTD as well, it is just officially written as UCTD. When I tried to ask about it she was pretty vague about it and just said we were saying UCTD so we can change it if we need to and that we would treat it the same regardless. I have been pretty confused about what I have and was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this? \nHope this is alright, I am pretty new to reddit! Thanks all.", "Those of us taking Plaquinil might be in for good news in these trying times  I have been wondering this! I am low key freaking out about catching the virus haha. Hope everyone is safe! I suggest caution. Even in a best case scenario (whereby Plaquenil works as a preventative treatment for the average person), it is very unclear how the virus would affect someone with an autoimmune condition, even with hydroxychloroquine. Please do not put yourself or others at risk. When doctors and scientists discover an effective treatment, it will spread like wildfire, and it will be confirmed in a clinical trial. As of today, nothing like that exists for Covid19. However, I hope it does, and sooner rather than later. Not good news, this could make it difficult to get your medicine or at least raise prices", "MTX For the last six months, I have been flaring on and off to varying degrees. Because of covid, I have only spoken to my GP over the phone and seen my rheumatologist once. My relationship with my rheumatologist has been fraught at times but my GP has always had my back, so my GP has more of an idea how I am. Last time I spoke to my GP,  he said if I have another flare, I need to phone him and he will prescribe MTX. We cannot even try steroids because I am diabetic and bipolar. Methotrexate scares me more than MCTD and I am terrified to contact him despite my mental and physical health taking a nose dive.\nI could really use some positive experiences of MTX as I have already lost so much hair and have a serious phobia of nausea/vomiting. \nMy cervical lymph nodes feel like big marbles, I have got nasal and scalp sores but I am so frightened of this wretched drug, I cannot bring myself to phone my GP or rheumatologist for help. So, MTX (in combination with hydroxychlorquin) is literally the only thing that has worked to keep me from feeling awful. \n\nI hope what I have to say helps in some way. Honestly, it has been somewhat life saving for me. I had a lot of depression/suicidal ideation that stemmed from being in pain a lot. It does not make me 100% but it does make life way better than it has been. I do get sick on the mornings I take it (the MTX), but my weeks are, generally, way better as far as quality of life is concerned. \n\nI have been losing my hair due to it, but my dr gives me folic acid to help with that and some of the other side effects.\n\nIm not a dr, and I do not know what would be best in your situation, but it has really helped my quality of life. It is scary, it does have some crappy side effects, but it was worth it for me anyways. \n\nI hope you can come to a good decision for yourself. Thank you, I really appreciate your honesty. I know it can be a game changer for a lot of people, but as I am feeling wobbly, hearing positive experiences really helps. I know what I should do, I just need a bit of a push to pick up the phone and say \"I am not ok.\" It just depends on whether I do it tomorrow or wait for my rheumatology appointment next week. \nI am already on folic acid; we do not know if my hair loss is down to MCTD, covid, hydroxychloroquine or a fun filled combination of the three. I hope you can get to a point where you are, at the very least, feeling an improvement in your quality as f life :) Thank you. I am already so much better than I was when I became ill, so I know there is definitely hope for feeling healthier. I am another one that MTX has been a literal life changer. I am able to be active and am even preparing for a new career now. \n\nI take it once a week, in the evening before bed. The next day I either have twice the spoons or just a few less spoons. Either way, everything else feels SO much better. I am being evaluated to see if I am in medical remission next month. \n\nTake the Folic Acid and try Biotin for hair loss, too. Helps tremendously. Thank you so much. My partner takes it to control an eye issue and is the complete opposite of you. He has absolutely no energy the next day. \n\nI am so pleased it is been such a game changer for you! It really helps hearing positive experiences as most of the people I know who take it really struggle with the side effects even though they experience improvements in their symptoms. \n\nGood luck with your new career!", "how do you release tension in your back fascia? I have major problems with my back, leading me to have knots all over and nearly all of my subutaneous layer of fascia is so taught it hjurts to be pushed on or pulled. Yet it feels good to get pulled on too. \n\nMyofascial Trigger Point physical therapists are amazing and help me a lot but pandemic. I normally use a mobilization wedge and a \"bed of nails\" a foam pad covered in plastic discs with pointy triangles all over, but I still feel like I do not have the perfect tool for helping my skin out. \n\nIf you also have major issues with back fascia being tight and sensitive, how do you stretch it, calm it down, or relax it? Buy some lacrosse balls and roll around on them on the floor is there a reason lacrosse balls over some other kind of ball? They are hard in the middle so they stay hard when you lay on them instead of squishing. You can use them to dig into your muscles/fascia that way. ok. thanks for the idea malkie :) You are welcome. Thanks You are welcome! If you Google lacrosse ball massage there is a bunch of articles and videos that will show you where to put the balls. Swimming, kayaking, and/or weed You can try foam rollers I bought a massage gun/fascia blaster", "Dysphagia? I have heard mctd can have a dysphagia component. If this is you, can you detail it? Where does the food get stuck? Can you not commence the swallow or does it get stuck in your throat? Esophagus? Is it a coordination thing? Does different food consistency count? I may have this. I get food stuck in my throat, like past the epiglottis and I throw it up. Usually silently, no one would even notice. Does not happen all the time, but it was a couple times a month. I tend to eat fast, and so I probably wasnt chewing enough. I was in grad school and working so eating quickly was basically the only way I would eat. I graduated and am not hair on fire frantic exhausting all the time. It was not with soup or soft food, usually fast food like a burger or chicken strips. I asked the doctor about it and she said to write down when it happens, but it has not happened in the weeks since my visit so that is why it is not certain. It is something that *can* happen but just because it could happen, does not mean it *will* happen. \n\nI get the anxiety around it. When I was first experiencing symptoms, I was so freaked out that I thought I would lost my ability to swallow - I had not, it turned out that my sister in law just cooked very dry chicken.  I like to think that when my doctor retires and writes his memoirs, the crazy lady who thought she was close to death because of dry chicken will merit at least a paragraph. Fun fact....adults cannot swallow more than five times without a break. That would really scare someone trying to see if they can still swallow!\n\nI have lost the mobility in my esophagus and have been on omeprazole for 30 years.  The only real problem I have is with pills.  I must eat something right after and then drink more.  That and I am the world\u2019s slowest eater. \ud83d\ude06 I think we could probably hold a contest for the world's slowest eater! \nYou have been on omeprazole nearly as long as I have been alive! That gives me hope that it will prevent my naproxen from rotting a hole in my stomach so thank you, I guess lol Hey, there, Sis!  Yes, I am 72, and nearly twice in age the length of time I have been on it.  And I am trying to stay off NSAIDs, but please make sure you get scoped every five years or so. It happens to me. It is like my throat forgets how to make the muscles move to swallow. Or like my throat muscles are frozen. It is way worse if I am laying. It only happens with like spit or liquid. I usually panic and then I keep trying and it does not work and then eventually it works the whole thing like like 10-15 seconds long No one's mentioned that I should get scoped unless I start showing symptoms of gastro problems so thanks for the tip! I am bring it up next time I see my rheumatologist. \n\nI am not overjoyed about being on NSAIDs but I do not seem to metabolise pain killers well so they seemed like the best option because my fingers were horribly swollen at the time and they do not knock me out or leave me semi-conscious and permanently anxious. If you have a good rheumy, I would suggest trying some other disease modifying agents.  My late husband ended up on oral gold, a very old treatment and used rarely, which actually saved his sanity.  This was prior to biologics.  However, I would definitely recommend a baseline scope (it is no big deal), just to make sure there is no Barrett\u2019s or other damage. My relationship with my rheumatologist has been hit and miss. It is been much better since one of the nurses at my GP surgery got so sick of asking how I was doing only to be told nothing had changed and my pain was being ignored. Since she spoke up, he is been brilliant. \nI think I am going to have to explore different options for pain relief because since having covid, I have had to have the amount of naproxen I am on because it seems to irritate my lungs. \n\nThank you, I really appreciate your insight and it is reassuring to hear from someone who is lived with MCTD for so long. I am glad you are going to explore other options. You deserve it Aww, thank you. I was diagnosed with esophageal dysmotility earlier this year. I was having this intermittent right-sided chest discomfort and episodes of coughing right after I lay down, which was suspicious for ascending aspiration (reflux going up from the stomach into the trachea/lungs). Since I have MCTD I brought up the possibility of it being the esophagus with my rheumatologist. I had an video swallow study and an upper endoscopy with manometry (pressure measurements down the length of the esophagus). It turned out I have severe dysmotility in the lower third of the esophagus, where it is made of smooth muscle, which is what the autoantibodies attack in MCTD. The upper esophagus/throat is skeletal muscle and usually unaffected, in my understanding. \n\nInterestingly, I had not had symptoms of heartburn, though had been on omeprazole since a long round of steroids a few years ago so maybe that masked it. During the study I had to swallow marshmallows, which got stuck in my lower esophagus on the video. I could not feel them being stuck, but I did feel like I needed to swallow multiple times in a row even though nothing was in my upper throat. I also have had the globus sensation (feeling of a lump in the throat) before, but since that is common with anxiety, post-nasal drip, and other things, I never got it evaluated. Do not know if that is related or not.\n\nNow that I am aware of it, I can definitely feel things getting stuck. Bread and pasta, especially. It is in my mid-lower chest, and I just drink plenty of liquid to wash the food down. I do not have any problems with choking or initiating the swallow. Oh, and the esophageal dysmotility explained why the enamel on my molars was disintegrating at a rapid pace, even though I do not have a particularly high-acidity diet. If your dentist starts puzzling about that it might be a sign. I have to sleep with the head of my bed elevated now.", "swollen finger, any suggestions i was recently diagnosed with MCTD. i woke up this morning and noticed my finger was a bit more sensitive than normal, like i had a hangnail or something. it has only gotten worse all day and begun to swell more and more. it is throbbing and is extremely painful. its just this one finger and is warm to touch. my doctor warned me about this happening... is this an autoimmune issue or just an infected nail bed? it is just one finger! not all of them but want to check bc this is still new and i am unsure of how this diagnosis affects me or everyday things Is there any spreading redness?  If not, it could be inflammation.  Do you have any Epsom salts you could use for soaking? the redness has not gone past my knuckle &amp; yes i have been soaking it in hot water &amp; epsom salt! this morning it was white near my nail so i think it is just an infection. it was much more painful last night which worried me but it is much more bearable today which is good For finger infections, I use an double antibiotic on a bandage overnight.", "Skin biopsy Has anyone had a skin biopsy? I am due to have one (potentially multiple) on Friday, assuming my local hospital does not get overwhelmed by Covid between now and then. \nI am not so much worried about the actual biopsy, but the aftercare concerns me. I had a huge flare last month which somehow caused old scars to reopen (literally, years old scars started bleeding or looking like fresh scars) so I would really appreciate any tips on healing. \n\nMy forearm is definitely being biopsied because my GP was worried about polymorphic light eruption, but there is a chance my face, neck and scalp will also be biopsied. I do not have much help to offer, as I heal veeery slowly.  1.   Moist wounds do heal better.  2.  Ask for suggestions from your rheumy, and if there is little help there, 3. See a dermatologist.  Those guys do not get the respect they deserve.   Also see if hyperbaric wound healing is available to you. I have had a skin biopsy before. I have also have two incisional biopsies on my neck and armpit and one needle biopsy. I was Also having bad flares during all four of these\u2014 that is why I needed it\u2014- but I always healed great and recovered in a normal amount of time for someone with mctd lol. \n\nThe skin on my neck never fully healed. I still have a nice looking scar on it from 4 years ago. If it is going to be done by a dermatologist\u2014- I would expect it to heal nice and smooth but i had a regular surgeon that did not do well. \n\nThey have costemic surgeons to fix it if it does not heal correctly- which insurances cover. \n\n\nThey will put you to sleep or numb the whole area\u2014 so you should not feel a thing! I wish you the best of luck on the procedure as well as the results- biopsies are scary but if you can deal with mctd\u2014 you can deal with this biopsy with your eyes closed\u2014- pun intended. It is a dermatologist who is going to do it. I am not sure I would trust my rheumatologist with a dermal punch or a scalpel lol \nHyperbaric wound healing definitely is not available on the NHS, or at least not at my relatively small local hospital. Fortunately it is being done by a dermatologist. I have had one appointment with her and she was lovely and the reviews from her private patients have all been good. \n\nThere is a good chance my neck is being biopsied, but to be fair, it is already horribly scarred so I doubt it can end up looking worse! \n\nIt is because of my flares that my GP requested I see a dermatologist as my skin seems to be getting worse. The dermatologist cannot decide if it is MCTD, the lingering effects of covid or a mix, so she thinks doing a biopsy is the best way to know if there is systemic involvement that is going to need something stronger than hydroxychloroquine. \n\nUnfortunately, bring in the UK insurance is not really a thing and cosmetic surgery is only available for patients who have had a terrible outcome with severe scarring in a prominent place.  I am fine with my arms and neck scarring, I am not so fine with my face if she decides that needs a biopsy. \n\nI winced at the thought of having your armpit biopsied. Having had a tattoo very close to my armpit, that must have been sore once the anaesthetic wore off! Yea I had nerve damage afterwards\u2014 do not mean to scare ya\u2014 but I could not move my arm for months and I had to wear a sling until eventually I started rotating it more and more\u2014it was painful but\u2014 I had good drugs to help lol. - glad it is being done by derm. \n\nI also do not care about scars much either \u2014 they are my fighter scars. \u2014 it is one of the only physical signs of my struggle with mctd so it all tells a story. \n\nWishing you luck! ( Thanks but this is not at all relevant. I have noticed you have posted this on a lot of subs, which makes me think you are just searching for \"skin biopsy\" and posting on any thread you think is relevant. \n\nI would suggest you at least read the content of the post before commenting as not everyone needs to read about malignant skin cancer when they are already worried about undergoing an unrelated procedure. \n\nPresumably you are a medic or a medical student: you need to be aware that this is not how you put patients at ease. You are welcome. Sorry, who is welcome for what?", "My story of how I had MCTD and then it went away... please share any insight you may have After a time period of a lot of stress and anxiety I began to experience extreme symptoms after eating anything with even the slightest salt sugar and carbs. I had extreme leg pain in what felt like bones to the point where I could barely walk. My feet would swell, I had headaches and a burning sensations in my head and dark marks on my feet. After taking a plane to Europe (I heard going through mental detectors might aggravate symptoms) for my grad trip things became terrible. Eating ANYTHING even water caused the extreme pain. After my trip I tested my ANA and RN tests came back positive and my doctor diagnosed me with MCTD. After about 2 months of taking plaquenil my tests came back positive. My doctor was confused as he said if I had an autoimmune disease, even in remission my tests should always come back positive. He said I could have possibly had a viral infection. So I guess now I do not have it anymore \n\nHowever I do suffer from brain fog that only started after I took the plaquenil. I thought once I stopped taking it, it would go away. But it never has. The brian fog is extreme and incapacitating and usually happens immediately after I eat. And sometimes I can eat ANYTHING and it will still happen \n\nI rely on a Medaluca vitamins now, but sometimes when I stop taking them my symptoms, like the leg pain will start coming back\n\nSo does anyone have any insight? Has anyone else been diagnosed with MCTD and then it went away? Any else experience extreme brain fog? \n\nStay strong and God bless \ud83d\udc9c Honestly, it sounds more like you had a misdiagnosis of MCTD due to the aforementioned virus.\n\nHave you been evaluated for Fibro? Seen by a gastroenterologist? Had food allergy testing done by your PCP?\n\nI would caution you against correlating your Melaleuca vitamins and your leg pain going away. Tests reveal they too often do not have the amount of vitamins they claim to (i.e. they only test out as having 40% of the Vitamin A they report to have). Maybe you have some kind of metabolic disorder. How can I find this out? What tests would I need? This seems like the most likely answer to me.\nI would definitely go back and talk to your GP about the symptoms you still have and hopefully they will help you figure out what the next step should be. Some of those symptoms are symptoms I experience but unfortunately no, MCTD is incurable as far as science knows currently. We do have periods of flare ups and remission. Autoimmune diseases effect everyone just a little bit differently but you sound more like you may have overlapping issues and not just any one thing. Metabolic panel lab testing. You may already be getting it done by your internal medicine doctor. \n\n ( I am not really sure to be honest with you but I would start with a family doctor or primary care physician. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Autoimmune diseases do not \"go away\"; you either went into remission or never had it in the first place. So if I texted positive once, does that mean I still have it , or he misdiagnosed me?  Your doctor is an idiot lol what tests were done An ANA and RNP I believe and they tested positive For some unknown reason, your ANA can show negative but you are still sick. Mine has come back both positive and negative within a 6 month period and I have always had MCTD. RNP, I am not sure about. I would go for second opinion because the last thing you want is to go without treatment and cause damage. Thank you! I will do that", "Possible MCTD diagnosis Hey guys, my GP thinks I have MCTD, waiting to see a rheumatologist- could I get an opinion on what this means? \n\nANA is Detected, mixed pattern, &gt;=2560 speckled, &gt;=2560 Atypical Speckled \n\nI have no idea what this means, Dr was a bit weird about it, but that might be because I have had symptoms for over 18 months now, and he just kept saying it was a virus. Sm and RNP were detected, Rheumatoid factor was 58\n\nThanks for any help with this, feeling a bit overwhelmed and definitely sick of being in pain everyday! Hi there, \n\nSorry you have had such a long road of feeling bad! It sounds like you probably have an autoimmune disease of some kind. That is a strongly positive ANA, so if you also are having symptoms it seems likely you will receive a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease. \n\nThe specific diagnosis will depend on your symptoms and the pattern of your autoantibodies. It seems possible they will say it is MCTD, which is strongly associated with the RNP antibody, but it is possible you will hear lupus or RA discussed as well. It is also possible that you will not get a specific diagnosis yet if it is not clear exactly which fits best. If this is the case, try to be patient! Sometimes things are not totally clear at the outset, but over time become more so. It does seem like you have something, though, so if they dismiss you altogether and/or do not start treatment for your symptoms I would seek another opinion. \n\nWhat symptoms have you been experiencing? Thank you for the thoughtful reply!\n\nStarted nearly 2 years ago, came home from work one day with significant joint point pain over whole body, was exhausted and pretty much slept for 3 days. Developed a rash all over my body, then my hands stiffened up and that lasted for over 6 months - could barely move my hands in the mornings and they slowly got better over the morning. Pretty much hands are always swollen. Could not dress myself, could not open bottles etc. Loss of appetite \n\nI have damage to my tendons and pulleys etc in all of my fingers, fingers lock up. Terrible pains in my wrists, elbows and shoulders, almost like rubber bands are snapping. Had to stop lifting weights as my hands would just let go of the weight bar without warning\n\nLymph node under ear swells up real big, feels like it is crushing my jaw - I have had trouble with my jaw for years too, which now I see might be related to this. I have hearing loss in one ear with ringing \n\nI have a base level of pain that I live with now, it is not like it was when it all started, but that was a flare up I guess. The fatigue comes and goes but I feel ok now First of all...do not google.   It will not help.  Go to Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, or any reputable site.\n\nSecond, I am 72, and have been living with it for 35+ years.  After my initial flare, things settled down to three main symptoms.\n\nThird, if your doctor cannot or does not want to be helpful, get thee to a major medical center.  What continent are you on? Thanks for the reply :) I am in Australia, and was thinking that it was time to get a second opinion That it is.  You are lucky you had a blood test run, and perhaps your doc can make a recommendation.  Keep us updated.  We are here for you.", "Laser eye procedure Has anyone with MCTD had laser eye correction after diagnosis?  And if so, did everything work ok?  Any negative results? My dad is an ophthalmologist with a patent in refractive surgery. He does NOT recommend laser surgery for people with autoimmune conditions. IF you decide to have it DO NOT get Lasik because they cut the cornea. Epithelial cells can grow into the cornea and cause problems. Worst case scenario is that some people need a corneal transplant. LASIK also causes the eyes to become dryer which is bad if you end up with Sjogrens. (I have MCTD too). You can consider PRK because it is only laser on the surface of the cornea. That said for people like us, it is not the best idea.", "Poll for the Community: How often do you see your doctor? And what is the most common reason you visit them? Not sure about everyone else here but since I have been diagnosed I have continued to see my doctors so frequently that I have actually built really good relationships with them. I usually go in for some new symptom that popped up ( I get new or worse symptoms on a monthly cadence it seems. To be honest, I am not really sure why I go so much - nothing really comes out of them other than the usual, \u201ckeep getting good sleep, exercise, and eat clean foods.\u201d However, I do feel comforted by the fact that my \u201cmedical team\u201d is aware of the progression of my disease.

I have been experiencing changes in my cognitive abilities and I was wondering if anyone knew If it is possibly linked to mctd . I was diagnosed with mctd at the age of 10 when my chest began to rapidly cave in because of pectus excavatum.My mind has constantly been fuzzy , I can never concentrate , and I always have migraines . I have been a straight A student my whole life , but this year I have struggled to get by with B\u2019s and C\u2019s .This started happening about a year ago out of the blue and it is been worsening since . I was scheduled to see my specialised doctor soon but because of the corona pandemic my appointment was cancelled and I will have to wait a while . I think it could be. I think it is more to do with autoimmune disease in general and the taxation on your body, rather than MCTD in particular.\n\nI get brain fuzzies a lot; I have MCTD but I do not know how much of my cognitive problems are caused by that versus other stuff. But it has gotten better with careful vitamin supplements. I was tested for the MTHFR mutations and came up positive for both so I need to take a high dose of methylated folate because folic acid and regular folate are basically waste floating around my body unused. I would been taking a high-ish dose of B12 and switched to the methylated version of that too even though the support for that is weaker (but it is very difficult to take too much B12 so why not really). I know my gut biome is all kinds of messed up, possibly from MCTD possibly from too many antibiotics as a kid, and gut health has a strong but poorly understood relationship with mental health. Your late teens and early twenties tend to also be a time for autoimmune flare-ups because of the stress, so there is that. For this sort of thing, my doctor's office is still seeing patients via telemed, to ask questions and formulate plans and determine how much worry an issue is worth. Maybe you can schedule if not with your specialist at least with your PCP?\n\ntl;dr strong possibility, but also could be something else or tangentially related and it is possible you can find things that help, if not fix the issue. Try telemed. Brain fog is linked to a lot of autoimmune issues so it makes sense that MCTD would be the same.\n\nI definitely struggle with things that I never used to. Simple tasks take so much longer, my short term memory is awful, I cannot read as much as I used to and I forget words. It is much worse when I am tired or in pain. Sounds like brain fog. Try healing your gut, maybe something you are eating is off setting the fog. I know my brain fog is correlated with what I eat My wife gets brain fog intermittently, but if it is something that has been going on constantly it could be something else. Are you taking any medication? It could be a side-effect. There was one med she was on (I do not remember which) a while ago that gave her worsening brain fog the more she took it to the point where she would not even drive. \n\nSo, echoing others - if it is intermittent, it is to be expected with MCTD. If it does not go away, though, go see your doc. Especially if it seems like it is getting worse.\n\nHope that helps. Be well. It is absolutely a thing with MCTD, unfortunately. The way my neuropsychiatrist explained it to me, is that cognitive issues with fluctuate depending on the amount of inflammation you have going on. I do not take any medication for MCTD as of now but I do take concerta for adhd and lamotrigine for bipolar depression but I have been experiencing this since before I started taking them .", "Help with with my dad. Some background to start. My dad  was diagnosed almost 20 years ago. A few times a year he has really awful flairs. They are getting more frequent and worst of all they are effecting his mental health. In 06 there was a problem with a medication he was on and we had to have him committed. \nHis doctor just weaned him off Lexapro and put him on Prozac. It is definitely made things worse (in my opinion) the doctor is aware of this and he has a appointment tomorrow. When he is like this he takes everything out on my mom and or sister, they are \u201cno good\u201d and treat him like a \u201cchild\u201d. The only person he will remotely talk to reasonably is me. I am trying so hard to help him to understand that yes, we do not truly understand the pain he is in because we cannot feel it. We do not have to feel it because we see it. I am at a loss as to where to go from here, if anyone has any advice I appreciate it. Thanks for letting me vent here. Will you be going to the appointment with him? No, my mom is. They like to keep me for lack of a better term out of it. So that he does not blame me for whatever decisions are made. That way he will at least talk to me. Sounds shitty but it works. Can you go over a list of questions for her to ask the doctor, so she has a plan? A lot of people do well on either one or the other but not both - lexapro is a newer form and people do alright on it but do not usually do well on prozac and vice versa. There are many different mental health medications they can try though. Prozac is very old school. It actually made my mom become abusive but she did well on some other drugs. \n\nHaving mctd can be really frustrating because everybody has different symptoms and handles medications differently. But it sounds like his medications are not keeping the flares in check. Keeping in mind that flares can come on because of stress, illness (colds, flus, etc) and sometimes having mctd is not the only thing we get. Usually if you have one autoimmune disease you develop others or are at risk of it. Not all autoimmune drugs do the same things. What works for one does not work for another. There are dmards and biologics and immune suppressives and things that do not suppress and steroids and nonsteroidals and the list goes on. If his doctor is not helping him well enough, do not be afraid to go elsewhere. I do not know if anyone can truly help you without knowing you all.\n\nBur to be honest, it sounds like your dad really needs to find help outside his family and rheum - something like conversation therapy or - at least! - support groups.\n\nI hope he is not too stubborn and you can nudge him in that direction.\n\nOtherwise, he needs to keep up with his rheum. If you have the capacity, you can always ask for a second opinion.\n\nI am sorry you are all suffering like that. And I hope your dad gets (at least) better soon.", "MCTD? Last year I had a shoulder injury after throwing logs over handed continuously for a week. And ever since then I have had to go to the chiropractor, during the middle of the year I got mono which was a pretty severe case. And after about four months of having that I started to feel very unwell and just really tired all the time and extra shoulder pain on top of that. So I had blood test done and my ANA levels were elevated, and from what I have gathered i know that mono can sometimes be linked to SLE. I am still trying to find a rheumatologist. With that being said, at the beginning of December I had to go have an x-ray done on my shoulder, and the orthopedic surgeon put my condition as musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder? He did not explain anything, i actually seen it through my health insurance app on my conditions lost. I have the photos of my x-ray but of course I am no expert so I do not have any idea on how to read what I am even looking at. I have an MRI scheduled for next week, but the reason I am making this post is that I was just curious if anyone had any idea why the surgeon would put that as my condition from seeing my x-ray. He was not even the one that did that blood test and unless he seen it in my files that I had elevated ANA levels I am curious on why he would put that as my condition. If anyone has any sort of input I would really appreciate any and all of it. I know none of us are doctors but I would just like some opinions. Thank you so much.", "Women: Did you get your period back after treatment? Hello, I had a question for the women who lost or had irregular periods / PCOS before treatment.\n\nI have had high cortisol in addition to my positive ENA, and my period has been MIA since I went off birth control 7 months ago.\nI have inflammation/ lean PCOS, but my doctors seem to think it might resolve to some degree with treatment. I just started Plaquenil. \n\nAnyone who was missing their period when they got sick, did it return after treatment or medication?", "How is your week going? Hi everyone! Just wanted to check in and see how everyone is week is going. Thanks for checking in! \nI have felt very lethargic and low energy this week. I stayed in bed all day yesterday. Havnt had one of those kind of days in a while. Over all I feel okay though. Just super exhausted and depleted of energy. My sister is bringing her dog over today and I am sure that will make me feel better. I hear you, r/jellydwell3r! I have been having a rough go this week. Lot\u2019s going on in our lives right now that is stressful and draining. I am trying to do my best to keep up with it all but with the brain fog it is been emotionally and physically exhausting! It is been rough, started seeing new doctors and I keep getting information I do not want to hear, just my mctd not doing well and fairing up. But I am trying to keep my spirits up and now I am on reddit to see what is going on with everyone else. I would rather look at all the good stuff here vs wallowing and being sad about what is going on with my health. Doing okay but pretty fatigued. Went to my GP and asked for a bunch of tests based on suggestions I got from this community (thanks guys!) so maybe I am a step closer to getting some answers as I still have no auto-immune diagnosis. Also had a phone appointment with a pain clinic which was a reminder of how useless and disinterested they are. I would be annoyed if I did not write them off a long time ago. \n\nHow are you doing?", "Has anyone else had this? Doctor is dismissing it but I think it is a concern. In the early days of my symptoms I started to have pain in my hips (this was before I ever developed arthritis and now that I do have arthritis I know that it was not arthritis pain). The best I have concluded is that it is essentially bursitis. Rather than my joint being in pain I believe it is actually the fluid sacks called bursa on the outside of my hip just under the surface that are actually hurting. I used to enjoy running in the mornings but once the sensitivity in my hip developed, if I tried to run, within 5 minutes I would be in so much pain that I had to stop and for the next 2 weeks or so I would have a limp in my walk from the now-exaggerated pain. I am concerned now because I think it is starting to spread. I noticed that I have relatively large lumps on both sides of my back where my back dimples are. These lumps tend to swell larger and get sore when I am flaring - similar time those in my hips. Does anyone else have experience with bursitis due to MCTD? After a few ultrasounds and imaging tests that came back clean, my doctor has just dismissed this issue but I still feel like it is important. Especially now that it is spreading. Any thoughts or even speculation are welcome! Thank you \u263a\ufe0f The MCTD sub is really dead here.  The ones on facebook have hundreds of active members.  you might get a meaningful response here, but probably not.  If you join the facebook groups for MCTD you will get a lot of response.  Good luck! ... just also dropping that you are able to and should get a second opinion any time you do not feel taken seriously.\n\nIdk, your question is probably too specific and no one can help you here.\n\nI hope you get answers! For many years I was dismissed it was not unlit my legs gave out on me at work last fall that I was able to test done", "Need a moral boost! Positive experiences with Plaquenil? Need a moral boost! Positive experiences with Plaquenil?\n\nI am supposed to go on 300mg of Plaquenil for MCTD. \n\nI have been avoiding the medication due to my fear of the renal toxicity. I know it is rare, I have been told. I also am set up to see an optometrist every 2 years. \n\nHowever I make my living as an artist and the idea of losing vision is terrifying. Terrifying. Especially since it gets more likely over time :/ I feel like I will never feel safe!\n\nCurrently my only big symptoms is painful hair loss. Which is incredibly hard on me and my self esteem and has greatly affected my life. But I keep thinking I am gambling my precious eyesight for hair. \n\nWould anyone have any positive stories to help me make this transition? I just cannot get over it. Here is some positive news from a retired optometric technician, and former plaquenil user.  Vision side effects start with very small changes in your blue vision range, and can be monitored with a D-14 screening.  Visual field effects come later, if at all, and both stop if meds stop.\n\nDoes that help? I have been on it for about 4 months. Feeling a bit better. Not noticing too many bad symptoms. \n\nI am worried about retinal toxicity too, but when you think about how bad the progression of mctd can get\u2026 it is a worthwhile trade. They will catch the eye changes well before it begins affecting either of us. But if I let the mctd progress? Well I could lose my fingers or toes, die from organ failure, the list goes on. You are not just gambling for hair, you are gambling disease progression \n\nThis is clearly the better choice. I can offer you a couple of things from my experience. I have been on plaquenil for 6 years. Only 400 mg. The average dose worked up to if needed is 600 mg  so 800 is pretty high. I did the same thing as you it sat on my shelf for a couple of months while I stared at it. I had a lot of trepidation about the side effects.\n My doctor eased me onto the dose starting at 200 mg for a couple of weeks. This minimized the lesser side effect of nausea . I also take it at night to avoid stomach issues.\n I go to a retina specialist every 6 months and they scan my eyes and they can catch any degeneration early. There is also something called an amsler grid you can pull it up on your phone. When you look at the grid if the lines begin to get to get wavy you immediately stop your medication and contact your doctor. It is a simple thing that for some reason a lot of doctors forget to recommend.\n I also suffered hair loss before I started my meds and for about 6 months after. I also take  Is methotrexate. This medication has been instrumental also in controlling my disease process. Taking folic acid and a good b-comlex really helps with these meds as they can deplete them from your body.  Also taking a biotin supplement and switching to a shampoo and conditioner that contains biotin was amazingly helpful in stopping the hair loss And even in returning my hair to the way it was before I got sick. It is hard enough having a rare disease and it is just insult to injury to to  suffer hair loss. There is a vitamin company called wonder labs that has a really good biotin shampoo and conditioner it costs about $14 for both and if you order on Friday's the shipping is free.\n I hope this helps. And I wish you the best. My plaquenil has been sitting on my bathroom counter for 2 months. I had my baseline ophthalmologist testing. The Dr had to be in his 70s. He said he does the screens for plaquenil eye damage all the time and has yet to run across it in a patient. \n\nI have been freaking myself out over the rare mental side effects like psychosis \ud83d\ude31 or more commonly anxiety. Also muscle weakness, mine are so bad now if they were any worse I could not walk. My muscle weakness went away after starting Plaquenil According to my rheumy, Plaquenil is one of the safest drugs out there and just got a bad wrap during that whole covid treatment debate. It has also been a miracle for me. It has helped with fatigue, muscle spasms, joint pain. The only symptom that it has not really touched is my dry eyes and facial rash. It has been truly amazing That for sure helps me.  Why did you stop using plaquenil? Sun sensitivity Are you actively taking any prescriptions now? I am having to take about 5 5-mg doses of prednisone per month to manage muscle pain and gi symptoms in addition to plaquenil.  Do you have a feel about whether that is a worrisome amount of prednisone? The only disease modifying med is Pilocarpine, for my dry mouth and eyes.  If that low amount of steroids is of help, it sounds reasonable.  Has your doc offered an alternative? No alternative.  I assume methotrexate would be the next step, but I am hesitant to get on that due to all the crazy side effects and the fact that my flare ups are episodic. If you Google it, it seems that 5mg is pretty low and standard for flares.", "I was on prednisone for 5 years...was that normal? I recently joined the rheumatoid arthritis sub and I saw comments saying prednisone is supposed to be a short term solution. I was put on it when I was first diagnosed and then I moved cities and my new rheumy kept me on it for 3 years. I moved again, this time to an area where I could only see a traveling rheumy once a year, and he kept me on it for another year until he retired and I got another new person. She helped taper me off and put me on sulfasalazine (I am also on hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate). I still keep prednisone for flare ups, but otherwise I have been off of it for one year. Was I supposed to be on it for that long? How long have you guys been on pred? For some, daily maintenance is required long term. I was on 80mg a day for 9 months, then 60mg/d for another 16 months until the oncologist they sent me to freaked out and demanded I taper off immediately. \n\nI had much success until the last 5 weeks before I came off of it. I did not want to admit it then, but after all of that time without, I was starting to feel kind of strange when I took it. My life became so dependent on it that I cried for several days at first. Tapered and now only use it when flaring. \n\nYour doctors can recommend your dosage to be adjusted, but there are some conditions that benefit from the maintenance. Do you have your labs done regularly for glucose and adrenal function?\n\nEdit Sorry. I MISSED the part where you switched meds. 80mg/day that sounds rough! I am sorry, tapering off sounds like it was really difficult. I hope you are doing well.\n\nI get lab work done regularly but tbh im not entirely sure what every test is for. I will ask my family doctor when I see her (I finally got a family doctor a few months ago!). Good luck to you! I hope the newer scripts work well and you can say goodbye to the prednisone for good. I need 5 MG of prednisone a day to not feel like I am actively dying. I just want my doctor to let me have it and stop trying to taper me. I am old, let me have some reasonably okay days even if they are fewer this way. It sounds like we at the same exact story. I had to keep canceling appointments because I was moving around so they kept me on my 90mg dose until I was able to come in-- 2 years pasted before I was tapered off. I had gained 96 pounds in 3 months. I then started methotrexate and hydroxy shortly after. I definitely should not have been on steroids that long\u2014 they are short term solution for immediate treatment and flares. That depends on your dose. 5 to 10 mg daily, in refractory cases, is not uncommon.\n\nHigher than that opens up the door to significant complications.", "Has anyone experienced premature grey hair because of their disease? Hello! Was wondering if anyone has experienced early hair greying because of MCTD. From what I read, there is no definitive answer, just wondering if anyone\u2019s had experience with this.... I am nearly 50 and barely have a few grey hairs, so not I. Thanks for responding....Yea, it seems it might be more genetic or stress related since I found a lot of people in the lupus subreddit have not gone grey early. Fwiw, I moderate two MCTD communities on FB and have not seen this as folks post a lot of pics and use their own as their profile. I started going white in my 30\u2019s, but it is the way in which my hair is turning white that my Rheumatologist told me could be attributed to the MCTD. I have random patches of it-I have the Rouge patch in the front of my hair (that one is pretty cool) but then I have another weird one smack on the side of my head that is about 2\u201dx 2\u201d. A literal white square. \n\nMy bigger issue is that I am losing hair like crazy and it just looks awful. I keep it short but have not been able to get it cut in about a year. I got my first gray hair at 24 so I would say yes I went grey at 16 from a particularly nasty case of systemic histoplasmosis. I do not think I would have gone grey so early if I had not gotten sick, but I definitely think my immune system had something to do with it.", "Has Anyone Tried Infrared Sauna? Has anyone tried using an infrared sauna to alleviate pain and other symptoms?  I have heard some people talk about using infrared saunas to help with autoimmune disease and was wondering if anyone here had experience with it? I actually built one in my home because it has helped me over the years with pain. Some respond better to cold, some to heat. I cannot tolerate cold but love the heat. Is also allows me to stretch out and get muscles and joints more mobile. I love it. Heat is lovely but it can cause more inflammation so you have to be careful. Cold therapy reduces inflammation but can trigger raynauds. I do more of a body part gets one or the other. My back gets cold, my hands and feet get heat. An entire full body sauna thing would be bad for me personally.", "Elevated RNP antibodies but no obvious symptoms ", "How long did it take take hydroxychloroquine to help you? Or did it at all?  I want to know this as well. I have kept putting off taking it and am now mostly bed bound from fatigue, joint pain and muscle weakness. I am sorry. I am on week 5. I am still struggling to get out of bed from the same things. I am so sorry to hear that. I was struggling but semi functional. I went to physical therapy last Friday and Monday for TOS and snapping scapula and it flared me up so badly. My muscles are sore and trembling and it hurts to breathe. It is amazing how reactive our bodies can be. It is awful It really, truly is. I am so sorry for your suffering. I went from working full time less than 2 years ago, doing lots of household things, driving two teen/preteen daughters around to barely functioning and not working at all. It totally misses with me mentally, I have so much guilt.. I am not suicidal but am totally at peace with dying right now because living is so hard. It was gradual.  I did not notice it until I noticed it, if that makes any sense.\n\nI must add I also take other meds with it, so plaquenil cannot take all the credit for improvements. It took me a while to feel the effects - probably somewhere around 4-6 months but once it kicked in, it changed my life. I am so sorry. I relate to what you said \n\nI used to work full time, run the house, have hobbies, go on hikes, all of that, and it came to a halt 4 years ago. I was so depressed. I felt like my life had been stolen from me. I was not adjusting to my new life as a disabled person. \n\nI went thru a long grieving process of my old life and accepting my new one. For years I kept dreaming of a treatment that would cure me and give me my old life back. I have come to terms that my old life and self is gone. I have mourned and depending on the day continue to mourn that loss. My diagnosises came one at a time over a few years. First they found rare spine disorders. Then they added fibro. Finally after continuing to complain they pushed me to a rheumatologist who ran bloodwork and listened to me and gave me my MCTD and sjogrens diagnosis.  I KNEW I had an autoimmune disease. I suspected lupus myself. I am pretty sure MCTD is the worst of all of my diagnosis. \n\nI do not know about you but I felt and sometimes feel useles. Like a burden with no value. I would push myself on my \"good days\" and then be in so much pain I wanted to die.Therapy helped me understand why it is important I do not push myself and how to be more gentle on myself.

This is a club no one wants to be part of!! Feel free to DM me if you ever want to chat. It took between 2 to 3 months Is for me to really start to see a positive effect from it. Now I can tell the difference if I even skip a couple doses. It really as helped with some of the joint pain and discomfort  not to mention  protecting you from your white blood cells attacking your internal organs. Wow.. that long? Was hoping it would be sooner! I am also on week 5\u2026 If you are in bad shape, short term prednisone is fast, but use sparingly. I have not noticed anything yet. Have you? It took about 3 months for me but it is been a life changer. Not yet.. my doctor mentioned at LEAST 3 months .. up to 6 for noticeable change.. not sure what that means but hope it is something good!! It is been a difficult road.. I hope you feel better soon. If you are feeling that bad (as I was.. could not sit up in bed), request short term steroids and see if that will decrease the inflammation enough for few weeks to pull you out of this.. It took about 3 months for me to notice a difference and and almost 6 months to get the full effect and benefit. 3-4 months but it is been amazing and really helped me. 6 months Hugs to you.

Things I have learned over the last year that you can take or leave. The mental toll is hard, I have a therapist now. I completely over hauled my diet. I am doing full Autoimmune protocol diet at my neurologists suggestion. It helped reduce my joint pain and increased my energy. Stress well and truly does a number on us, reduce the best you can. Look at supplements/vitamins you take. I was taking both garlic oil (trying to boost my immune system to avoid covid and flu) and ashwagandha...both are bad for Autoimmune. My neurologist has me taking vitamin D and B complex. Be very careful with exercise/body work. A massage therapist literally dislocated my jaw by massaging too hard over the joint. I am having chronic jaw issues now and likely need surgery.  I started PT 4 weeks ago. The Dr was not familiar with Connective Tissue Disease and hypermobility and messed me up BADLY. Basically my connective tissues are trash. Exercise is important but we injure so much easier than before. Heat, ice, anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxers and the occasional xanax or tramadol are my friends. Trying to find something to be grateful for everyday...some days are harder than others. Find a friend who gets it (even if they are only online), healthy people get annoyed with chronic illness. Finally find a medical team you trust. I am still working on this one. Thank you for the advice. I also just started ashwaganda to help me sleep and had no idea.  Thank you for the warning.  Thank you for everything you said. Fortunately I was already in counseling for stress/childhood issues. And she is helped me as this stuff has come along. I take L-theanine, tart cherry and magnesium complex to help with sleep. The xanax is for those few really bad nights when I really need sleep but just cannot.

Again, I did not know this at the time, but if I eat gluten now, I will end up with loose stools, headaches, and bloating. I have tested negative for Celiacs. I still take mtx weekly and some other meds to control my flares, but I am certain cutting out gluten has significantly improved my quality of life. I highly recommend that all people with autoimmune conditions at least try it out for a month and see how you feel, because you never know until you try, and there is no downside. Tested negative for Celiac's, and I love carbs. If a doctor had anything conclusive about my not eating gluten, I would stop. But until then... \ud83d\ude03 I thought I was reacting to the additives in commercial bread.  I stopped those breads, and started baking my own sourdough, which is fermented, instead of using commercial yeast.  My stomach ism much happier. I felt like it helped a little, but it wasnt night and day or anything. I read that if you try it, and wanted to see how effective it is you can try to eat some gluten again after like two or three months off. I gave that a shot and ate some pasta, and was soooo sore and stiff the next day, so I do overall think it helps. I will still have a little here and there, if theres something really tempting around, but Ive reduced my gluten by like 85% and I think Im better off. I think its worth trying, and was not nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be! Technically no, but sort of? I did a very strict autoimmune diet and felt immensely better within a week. I kept it up for 7 months or so and was basically pain free and lost a ton of weight, I only stopped when I became pregnant and everything I ate made me sick. \n\nI cut out ALL THE THINGS. Caffeine, alcohol, nightshades, beef, processed meat, gluten, dairy.... yeah all the things. Occasionally I would eat something on the \u201cbad\u201d list on purpose to see how I reacted. Once I ate a sandwich and within 20 minutes my hips started to ache. I have had numerous doctors recommend going gluten free. I did for a while, and it was certainly not any kind of \"cure\". When I reintroduced gluten, I did notice some more inflammation, but not significant. While the research is far from conclusive, I am increasingly unconvinced that gluten is itself the issue for non-celiacs. \n\nI have found that avoiding processed foods--enriched wheat flour in particular (which is a major source of gluten, of course)--has more of an effect than removing gluten altogether. I believe it is far better to eat sprouted wheat (like Ezekiel bread), that is high in fiber, than eating rice flour or something that is gluten-free but still high in simple carbs. As a general rule, I avoid most canned soups (which tend to have added gluten), anything \"white\" (bread, pasta), processed sugars, and processed meats. I wish I could report that it is changed my life, but unfortunately my autoimmune and other inflammatory conditions continue to get worse anyway. But when I slip up and eat a lot of it, my pain definitely gets worse. \n\nI am still planning to get to a nutritionist once it is safer to do so. I am still convinced diet is a huge factor for the continued progression of my diseases, but gluten is definitely not my major problem. I definitely do not have celiacs (excluded by gastroscopy).\n\nI am still unsure to try to turn around my diet so much.\nE.g. I also have high uric acid values, so I should adher to a vegetarian diet without much nuts and legumes. But then, I am appalled by cheese (had milk allergy as kid) and soy milk allergy.\nAnd, theoretically, vegan should be the ecological thing to strive for...\n\nI am also largely cross-allergic to any raw fruits and many nuts  *shrugs*\n\nSo, well, I guess I could try that but probably only - bc of the many many restraints - with help of a dietician. I cut out all processed foods, gluten, and animal products and felt a lot better. After a while I started to become more relaxed about my diet not feeling the best now. I should try to get back on track. I have the cross allergy to raw fruit and some nuts too, as well as some raw vegetables (especially carrots). I read an interesting article about allergies with certain fruits resulting from what trees were pollinating in the area at the time. Wheatgrass almost killed me!   \nFrustrating that when I am trying to live the healthiest I can, some of my efforts are thwarted a bit because of the things I cannot consume.   \nI can have things steamed or cooked, but lose a bit of the nutritional perks in doing so.", "Dealing with fatigue Hi everyone, I am 25 years old and have mctd, secondary sj\u00f6grens, hashimotos and coeliac disease. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice for handling fatigue? I am really struggling to keep doing everything that I need to do. I am afraid if i take a break to recover, I am not going to be able to pick myself back up. It is one of my major struggles. At the end of the day you are going to need rest regardless of how much you get done. Give yourself permission to say no to things that are not as important to you or will rob you of the energy you would like to spend on the most important things to you. I am 29, exhausted and my house is a mess but I am trying to take it a room at a time and design my living space for more functionality so on really low energy days I do not have to clean and there is healthy food in the freezer for me to eat. If you can afford a monthly or twice a month house cleaning you will love it.\n\nAsk for help from family.\n\nI drink a lot of caffeine\u2026 :(\n\nI ask my 7 year old to help me pick up after himself.\n\nI use a dishwasher.\n\nOtherwise my house looks a disaster and I just try not to care. I have two kids including a 6 month old and I am way too busy to stress.. it will sort itself out later. \n\nI get a boost of energy from exercise too. I have found that Plaquenil has helped me greatly with fatigue, although I also do a lot of caffeine unfortunately! Other things that seem to help are taking vitamin D and iron (because I had anemia which is common in lupus/MCTD), and avoiding stress. I had no idea how bad stress was for me until I had a huge work issue last week, and my symptoms flared up immediately. The next day I was exhausted. It must be a lot to deal with all of those issues at such a young age. I hope that you can find some ways to rest up and prioritize just the most important things you need to do.", "Feeling discouraged Hi everyone, I have been dealing with autoimmune issues for 6 years now and was only diagnosed with MCTD last year. It felt good to have an actual diagnosis but I also have a variety of other autoimmune issues so it can get pretty overwhelming. I recently just started college and this past year I have been hit with a number of unexpected health issues and have been dealing with constant flares for the past few months which has led me to quit my part-time job and has been making school and socializing very difficult. I also struggle with pretty severe depression and anxiety so all these issues with the lack of a support system has been making me feel very discouraged about my life and my condition. Every time my symptoms improve and I feel like I am making progress, there is always just another problem that pops up whether it is physically or mentally. I am very tired and was wondering if anyone had any tips to get through these periods where you feel very alone and sick? Hi there, I would like to recommend a book that pulled me through a rough time. \u201cBrave New Medicine\u201d by MD Cynthia Li. I\u2019be never been a reader but I have all but healed my symptoms through the books full of information that I have found. I have found that autoimmune for me has been very rooted in mental wellness. I quit my job and started to pursue things I love - not what was expected of me.  You must get psychiatry on your team, and adequately treat the anxiety.  Once that is well-treated you will have a more energy  and ability to handle the flares.  Please, from experience, take my advice. Did you get an accommodation at school? \n\nCan you switch to part-time student until you feel better? \n\nIt is going to be okay. You will get through it. I got through college even when I was sick as a dog. I take a lot of caffeine, I also have a script for adderall. That helps with the brain fog and concentration issues. \n\nYou can do this. Do not compare yourself to other people. They are not held back by a serious disease. Like we are. \n\nAt my worst I had to retake the same class three times. 3 quarters of hardship withdrawal. I tried to commit suicide. It was a huge mess. \n\nBut. I got through it and now I make 6 figures with my humanities degree. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk! Not what you asked for, but when I was still able to work I found the supplement d-ribose to be helpful when I needed to be alert and have a little more energy. It may not work for everyone, and was by no means a panacea\u2014I still had to stop working because of the crippling fatigue and brain fog. Thank you for the advice, I am definitely looking for a psychiatrist since my last one did not work out and am planning to make an appointment soon! I thought I would be okay without any accommodations because my symptoms slightly improved right before I started, but now I am rethinking that. I have always been hesitant of getting accommodations or reaching out to my teachers because I struggle a lot with imposter syndrome and downplaying my disease but I am starting to realize more I need to accept the help sometimes. I do not think I need to switch to part-time right now because I can thankfully do most of my classes and work online due to COVID. \n\nThank you so much for the encouragement and understanding, it is really hard not to compare sometimes because everyone around me is very abled but hearing about your experiences has definitely made me feel better that I can get through this even if it is difficult sometimes!! I will definitely look into that, thank you so much for the suggestion! Do not compare yourself to everyone else. Especially during college. \n\nLike I said, I had a tough time and took accommodations. It literally affected me in zero ways when I got into the workforce. What will matter is your degree and any experience you can get. I hope you find one sooner rather than later.  You are wasting SO much energy fighting this anxiety.  Read \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score\u201d if you can find a copy. I am so sorry you are dealing with this at such a young age. You definitely need some support from people going through similar struggles. While I have a wonderful husband I hate complaining to him all the time and I know it often gets to be a bit much. He just wants to fix me but cannot. I really wish this community was more active and while I am a bit older than you, message me anytime if you just want to vent or chat or anything. Thank you so much for the support!! Sorry for the late reply but I definitely might take you up on that :)", "UCTD vs MCTD? Hi everyone! I posted on here recently and got a lot of wonderful responses. I wanted to ask some questions/give an update. I just had my first appointment with a super nice rheumatologist. I have a positive ANA and a positive RNP, but all other antibodies were negative. She diagnosed me with UCTD, and did not really mention MCTD. Is there a difference between the two of these? I have read UCTD is relatively mild, but I thought the positive RNP pointed towards MCTD. Should I seek another opinion? She gave me some medicine for my Reynaud\u2019s and told me to come back in three months. She said we will keep an eye on it. I should also note that while I do sometimes experience joint and muscle pain, my condition is relatively mild. Biggest issues are reynaud\u2019s and fatigue. Thanks! Although I am not sure about the exact technicalities between UCTD vs. MCTD I do have this one advice. Do not read much into it as no matter which CTD it is the medicines / therapy / approach of rheumatologist is all more or less the same and the end target being that you either get clinical remission or your quality of life does not deteriorate.\n\nAs it is these things are tricky to diagnose and I am glad that atleast you have got some for of diagnosis, from here on forward it will be about knowing your limits, understanding what things cause flare-up and most important of all keeping a close eye on your organs.\n\nSo I would suggest that if you think what your doc is doing is working for you and is helping in tackling your symptoms and listening to you just stick with it.\n\nI was diagnosed with MCTD a month back, but atleast so far it seems it is is only my joints that are affected. My doc has put me on 400 mg of hydroxycloroquin and I am currently tapering off predisone 4 mg a day right now. Overall I would say my quality of life has improved massively, my fatigue is completely gone, pain is almost gone but hydroxycloroquin takes atleast 2 to 3 months to show any effect my doc says so let us see.\n\nOther than that, just lots of tests and screening are going on to make sure it is just my joints that are affected. Just do not read too much into it, but yeah easier said than done it is still difficult for me also to comprehend this deaseas. Honestly I think most rheumatological diagnoses are garbage, (if you even get one!) because like someone else said, they use many of the same drugs across many types of disease and there is so much crossover in symptoms or even antibodies. Just take it with a grain of salt. I agree with the other posts - most autoimmune rheumatological diseases are treated the same. After \"You have got an autoimmune disease,\" diagnosis is just a quick way of summarizing symptoms in this world.\n\nThat said, I do have experience with both diseases. I have the same lab results you are describing, first seen like 5 years ago (although my symptoms began many years before that). Because this plus this equals that, I was diagnosed with MCTD. The profile for MCTD is inflammation of connective tissues (obvs), specifically musculoskeletal (MSK) and the sacs surrounding your heart and lungs. My rheumatologist and I spent some time observing my symptoms, and I went to a neurologist because everything was pain and no numbing (unlike you and most people with autoimmune diseases I never had Reynaud's; dunno why). And then I had scans done of my heart, which was fine. No pulmonary symptoms either. I did not respond to the first few medications he prescribed. After a while, he told me that he was going to change my diagnosis and the only thing doing so could affect was possibly insurance in the future (for the better) to UCTD because, while I belonged in the MCTD category for my blood tests and *some* presentation of CTD, it was not fitting the profile of MCTD. While my bodily pains are a daily, grueling experience and I occasionally worry about losing the use of parts of my limbs, I am grateful that my condition is not affecting my heart, not life-threatening. \n\nReynaud's is a symptom of pretty much every autoimmune disease that affects connective tissues. Fatigue is a symptom, I have heard, of every autoimmune disease. \n\ntl;dr in my experience UCTD is when you have an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in MSK tissues, but not in the sacs surrounding heart and lungs as is often seen in MCTD, although the lab test presentation is the same. you have MCTD.    Here is how MCTD is diagnosed. Did they do heart and lung testing? If not you should have that too. ( UTCD is ICD-10-CM Code M35.9 - Systemic involvement of connective tissue, unspecified\n\nMCTD is ICD-10-CM Code M35.1 - Other overlap syndromes\n\nI have UCTD as a diagnosis and it seems like it still affects the insurance. Is UCTD and HCC, a diagnosis that increases patient risk profile? Or is just MCTD, because of the overlap syndromes Bruh, I dunno. I think that my doctor felt like UCTD was the less severe disease and therefore could potentially lead to less cost as a pre-existing condition for future insurances, particularly in our volatile system which is subject to frequent change (I am not sure that it is M35.9, it could be M35.8 or also contained within M35.1). What is HCC? I was just wondering. I am either completely naive, or just trying to figure out how my doctors view these diseases as they relate to insurance. HCC is for Hierarchical Condition Categories. I have it in parentheses next to UCTD on my online chart. Iiiiinteresting. Your doctor is explaining things completely differently than mine, it sounds like. If you ever figure out what it means practically/for insurance, I would love to know. I believe it means that the treating physician earns more from the insurer. There is a whole industry of trying to leverage them. Each HCC has a specific RAF score. RAF scores and base rate determine the Monthly capitation rate, which goes to the physician income. This is different for different plans. The RAF score for MCTD is probably a bit higher than for UCTD. It combines with other things you are diagnosed with. But how much it actually matters, I am not sure. I wish there were rheumatologists on this forum.", "Have you tried weed for pain management? Comments are encouraged\n\n( Yes, it works great and I continue to use it. (Wow, the choices were biased!) In what way were they biased? I was trying to avoid that. Where is the \"Yes and it works great\" option, then???\n\nI am not \"always high\". I take it at night to sleep (painsomnia).

Actmera I need help deciding which drug to choose. \n\nDx 2016, MCTD. Run the gamut on drugs. Finally settled on plaquenil and lefluomide with a third drug needed. \n\nThird drugs tried are humira and orencia (I liked orencia, but still had some issues)\n\nTerrible fatigue rn. Sleeping all weekend and every single evening after work. I think my doc is sick of hearing it but I need SOME energy. \n\nIn Feb she put me on olumiant. I have been on it 3 ish weeks now. It is not working. But idk how realistic the \"it takes 7 days to work\" claim is and I dont want to eliminate it before it has a chance to work. \n\nSo my doc gave me the option of staying on olumiant or moving to actmera. \n\nWhat do you all think? What are your experiences? Does olumiant work in just 7 days realistically? \n\nAlso actmera is it like mtx? Bc I abhorred mtx. \n\n\nThank you Hi there, quite congruent situation here, let us talk. Hi, I am in quite a similar situation even though my most prominent symptoms are joint pains and raynaud's, also at room temperature.\n\nNeither MTX (it is honestly poisoning yourself once a week), MTX+Leflunomide nor Leflunomide (all combined with 5-6 mg Prednisolone constantly) by itself have done the trick to get me pain free because of which i am starting Olumiant as well now. I am hopeful for that to finally work out.\n\nFor Raynaud's I am taking 3x20 mg Nifedipine per day and I get Ilomedine i.v. three times a year for 5 days in a row with moderate results.\n\nActemra was discussed as well but dismissed due to quite severe possible side effects.\n\nThe lack of energy I had experienced as well - but that was clearly connected to the MTX. Yeah I hated mtx. Hated it. Lefluomide isnt bad for me. I have an appt with my doc in a week and she mentioned actmera or rituximab. Idk know that I am bad enough for rituximab but I am damn sick of always being tired and also prednisone. Leflunomide worked for me but wasnt strong enough. I had to up my prednisolone to 6mg a day to sustain whereas the idea had been to get completely rid of it over time.\n\nSo now I am hopeful Olumiant will help enough to achieve that. Let us see... Addition after 4 weeks of Olumiant: It is amazing. Morning stiffness almost gone, joint pains significantly decreased, up to a point where I sometimes forget about them. Feel a lot less inflamed overall. Tapering pred, down to 5mg already. Thx.

Newly diagnosed Hi All,\n\nI am so glad I found this group on Reddit.\n\nLong story short, after years of symptoms that I did not put together or ever tell me Doctor since people just told me my grip issues and muscle pains are in my head/ do not go to gym.\n\nI was also diagnosed (after multiple years of misdiagnoses) with scalp psoriasis in November I went to see another doctor thinking my muscle pains might be psoriatic arthritis. However my doctor had a long chat with me and after my cheek redness , abysmal grip tested like 15 things 2 of them were rnp antibody, and ana complex.\n\nMy rnp is wayyy too high (4.9), and ana is abnormal..the appt with rheumatologist is 4 months out but PCP said it is mostly MCTD. The internet says it is a rare disease.\n\nWanted to know how were people here tested. How are you all living with it My symptoms pretty much always fit, but I went through a few different diagnoses until the standard blood test was changed and saw a new doctor who ordered that test. Physical therapy has been a godsend, I have found ways of exercising that do not cause me further injury and I strengthen some parts to help the other parts more affected by my disease. Fatigue and some less-treatable pains are the most unbearable parts, but I am still optimistic that I can find some sort of treatment. It helps that I have a good team of providers and a good support system. I am grateful that it is not a much more debilitating condition. It is not a curable disease, so it just is what it is. It is not curable \u201enow\u201c. Do not forget that. You were not born with this shit and I think it possibly can be cleared again. I believe that, because for me it does not cause permanent damage. Some days I do not feel any pain and my mrt pictures do not show any bone or joint abnormalities.\n\nWhat helped me: change your diet. There is a lot of experimenting but what clearly helps: cut out sugar and dairy. If you want you can try stuff like aip diet or keto. Maybe it helps you. \n\nFor fatigue: you can try to get low dose naltrexone by your gp. Helped me very much. \nDo yoga, meditate etc. \n\nEvery person with mctd is different but I think it is possible to live a quite normal life My GP initially thought I had dermamotomyositis or polymyositis, but said that he would leave a conclusive diagnosis up to a rheumatologist.

I was diagnosed fairly young, at 12 (so almost 17 years ago). Basically we were at a point where my doctor was hoping that once I started menses it would turn into one of the many disorders I was showing symptoms of (lupus, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoraic arthritis) but in the end it stayed the same. Blood test confirmed. I was in remission for 6 years but my condition has started deteriorating again sadly so I am currently trying to get into physiotherapy, plus maintaining my medicines. I need to be better on top of visiting my doctor, she is far too lax and I need structure of bi annual checkups or something with a laundry list of tests etc every time, instead of the go in with a pain, go for a test, come back for results dance we do right now (I do not have the time to visit her multiple times a month).", "Any views or opinions?

There are 2 close ups of the nail fold with capillaries showing in the original post. Aha, not there. Sorry new to this. For me I have noticed that the area before the nail fold will sometimes become irritated and see red streaks beneath the skin (my doctor uses a light and magnifier so they can be tiny) from enlarged capillaries from cold or autoimmune stuff and capillaries will expand and sometimes I end up with that afterwards.", "Second Opinions Hi everyone!\n\nToday I had an appointment with my Rheumatologist \u2014 it is been three months since my last, which was when I received my diagnosis and put on Plaquenil.\n\nI was certain that the Plaquenil had not taken effect because I am still feeling like rubbish but she assured me with the results of my most recent blood work that my levels have lowered and was unsure as to why I am still feeling such intense joint and muscle pain. She began briefly talking about Fibromyalgia, and it could be a possibility that I have that too.\n\nWe began talking about my anxiety, as here in Australia I am in lockdown and have not been working, so my Rheumatologist flip-flopped and thinks that my intense migraines, shoulder, neck and lower back pain is stemming from my Anxiety not Fibromyalgia. \n\nI was beginning to get frustrated. Even though I can hide my anxiety, and that it can show it is ugly head in mysterious ways I am finding it hard to understand how it could be taking this kind of a toll on my body. She prescribed Orphenadrine for the pain but if I am being honest, I still feel like I did before my MCTD diagnosis.\n\nAm I wrong to think that maybe I have been misdiagnosed? Have any of you? Or have you felt the need to get a second opinion? You need to consult a psychiatrist about the anxiety, and stop trying to hide it.  From experience, I know it can exacerbate pain.  As each problem surfaces, find a specialist to treat it\u2026neurology, dermatology, etc.  But first, get that anxiety under control so you can think straight. I was diagnosed with mctd but ultimately ended up realizing that most of my issues were due to hypermobility which is a common comordlbidity with mctd. Definitely look into it - many of your random aches and pains could be attributed to musculoskeletal issues and the body not being aligned properly. It took me forever to get a proper diagnosis because most doctors are really unknowledgeable about it or do not take the time to figure out what is going on. Good luck! This! \n\nI have hyper mobility in my shoulders as well! The joint issues exacerbate muscle and nerve pain. It is awful - I was convinced for so long that something was seriously wrong with me and my rheumatologists kept dismissing me and saying mctd should not be causing this much pain but they did absolutely nothing to figure out what was wrong. So frustrating!! First off, it can take several months to get an effect out of Plaquenil. Most of its proven effect is just statistical (slowing progression down) - so not immediately noticable.\n\nIt might subtly - I do think that it helped with my joint pain or at least made flares less frequent.\n\nYour doctor is right in that mysterious muscle pains can indeed be nerve misfiring (fibromyalgia) or psychosomatic. That does not mean you cannot have the initial diagnosis of MCTD on top. It also does not mean you are crazy or just imagining things. It also does not mean you should not get support for the pain - I noticed for myself that I have to get vocal myself to get real therapy recommendations. My doctors just assume I will pop some non-prescription pain killers once the pain is impairing me. There is little else between Plaquenil and giving pred in really bad inflammatory situations (except several long-term medication you will likely need longer monitoring for). Could you ask your rheum for physiotherapy?\n\nIf you get the feeling she is dismissing everything now as \"anxiety\", try talking to her about it. Especially once you are in treatment for anxiety. If it does not work, you always have the option to change rheum. It is absolutely possible that she has assigned you a category in her head.\n\nAnd rest assured that what you described sounds disappointing and sadly pretty common. I hope you can sort it out or find a new rheum soon.\n\nOn top of that, though, do not dismiss that you should get anxiety in check if you know you have it and already got diagnosed. A psych that takes you seriously is a good place to go.", "Test results, worried what it means My primary care doctor called and stated that my ANA direct was positive and my RNP antibodies are 1.8 and that I should see a specialist because it can mean that I have multiple connective tissue disease. \n\nI checked lab work from 2018 and I noticed that my RNP antibodies were 2.2 and my primary care doctor did not send me to a specialist (different doctor). \n\nHow worried should I be? Is there anyway experiences someone can share?\n\nThanks in advance. My first advice is..DO NOT GOOGLE the disease.  There is too much really bad, or old, information out there.

Look for people like that from whom to listen.  And, here is a great piece:   From your experience, what do you think of the results especially since in 2018 it was higher and my primary care did not tell me to go to a specialist. I would not worry too much.    It is early days yet.  How old are you, where do you live, and how soon can you see the specialist? I am 32 living in NJ and planning on calling the specialist tomorrow. As you navigate this condition, you will need a strong, compassionate, caring, knowledgeable team to help, including neurology, rheumatology, possibly dermatology (depending on the way it manifests) and a really good therapist to work it all out.  If you are near a major medical center, this may help.  But, being your own advocate is important.  There are also a couple of good Facebook groups (as well as a couple of pity parties). Could it be that they meant \"you could have any one of many CT diseases\" rather than \"you have mixed connective tissue disease?\nTry not to worry until you have seen a rheumatologist. MCTD is rare and it is something that should only be diagnosed by a specialist, not a GP.\n\nI saw that you have already been down the Google rabbit hole. Stop now and try to remember that you tend to hear worst case scenarios because the people who go through life with few symptoms are not remarkable enough to write about.\nLots of people live normal lives or lives where they have to make very few changes and can still do what they love. There are people who experience periods of remission. It really is not as terrifying as Google makes it seem.\nI am not saying it cannot be serious, but until a rheumatologist tells you this is what you are up against, try not to stress too much because stress is only going to exacerbate the symptoms you already have that resulted in you having bloods done in the first place. Thanks for this! I do wonder if it is normal that it is now lower? From 2.2 to 1.8? It can fluctuate. I waited nine months to see a rheumatologist and it got to the point where my GP had to run quite a few of my bloods twice just to make sure there was not an error. I could not tell you the figures, but I know he found it weird. Any idea what causes the differences for you? Nope, apparently I am just weird lol How did your visit go? I have my first appointment this Friday. Will provide an update afterwards. Thanks for checking in! For sure! I have had a similar experience. Found out by accident and was told it can take years for it to manifest or it may not progress at all. One Rheumy even told me she has had an increase in young women with these RNP antibodies come in that have not yet developed the disease. Oh that is interesting! Really curious to see what the specialist will say. They ran the blood work on me because of completely non related issues that I was having but wanted to do a complete blood work. My appointment on Fri will be one of three specialists that I need to see.. sigh. I had my specialist appointment today. She does not seem very concerned as I do not really show any symptoms; however, she does want to better understand my positive ANA result and has ordered a number of additional blood work. Unfortunately due to Covid the only time the lab can take me in for the blood work is in three weeks.. so more waiting. Based on the lab work she has so far, she suspects that all I need to do for now is do blood work every couple of months to a year; however, will only know for sure after these labs are run.", "Spasms? Twitching? So about a year ago I was at work going through a client list with a co-worker and was reading the list aloud. Several times there was like this... Stutter? I sort of spasmed over my words.\n\nThen I started twitching other places, and it is large movements like an entire arm or leg jolting suddenly. It happens several times a day and it is beginning to freak me out, especially when it happens at work and I cannot explain why I suddenly stopped talking or why I jolted suddenly. \n\nI am not sure if this might be a deficiency or mctd? \nI see a Dr in a week but wanted to ask. It is possible MCTD could affect you neurologically. Do not wait. This could be serious and you do not want any potential damage to be permanent. Be seen ASAP. I second this. It could be completely unrelated or it may be something that is really easily fixed, but you should never mess about with neurological symptoms. Please get yourself checked out - I really hope you are OK. I have had this too. Several years ago before I was diagnosed. At the time they called it \u201cstress\u201d and sent me home untreated.\nI still get the spasms occasionally but not nearly as often.", "This has helped me explain MCTD to my family, hope it helps you guys too. ", "Discussion Topic: What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed? We have all been there (or are there currently) - the blood tests, the army of doctors, the 100th 2nd opinion, the unlimited process of elimination, the random new symptoms, the unsolicited advice from family and friends who want to get it but just do not, the treatment decisions, and on top of it all the extreme lack of energy to get out of bed. My diagnosis process (still not even 100% conclusive) has definitely been one of the most challenging times in my life and I wish I had found this community sooner. I would love to get a discussion going about the best advice you received, would give someone, or just some encouraging words. I would say to trust your instincts and know that you know your body better than anyone. I had a doctor for a year and a half that would not give me a full series of tests, was a horrendous listener, and rushed me out of the office every day, diagnosing me w preclinical scleroderma\n\nA few weeks ago I saw a new rheumatologist at the same place, and he found my positive RNP and I was diagnosed w MCTD after just one visit\n\nmy old doctor would brush off symptoms like my constant pain, stomach issues, and immobility as part of depression, since preclinical scleroderma is not very pronounced, but the whole time I knew something deeper was up. And just like that, I saw something deeper was definitely up, and I was validated in that my symptoms are real and not in my head\n\nTrust yourself. You know your body and yourself better than anyone. Do not let anyone invalidate your experience, because you are probably right My advice: \u201cYou are not crazy!\u201d           \nTo second u/crispiercupid...I also was dismissed by several doctors and started to think I had developed some sort of mental health problem like hypochondria or something. Turns out, even though I had very little experience with health issues prior to MCTD, I just could tell something was physically off. I badgered my doctors, found new ones, and sure enough I was diagnosed. It was so painful physically and emotionally. I felt so alone. And I started to think I was losing my mind... and my body. It is one of those moments where you think you would be sad to get a degenerative illness diagnosis (my friends and family definitely were ready to be my shoulder to cry on) but it turns out it was a huge relief to have some kind of answer. I am so glad I did not give up.            \nListen to your body, it is probably telling you something. The best advice is to advocate for yourself. I walked into a clinic and asked for an ANA panel. They had no idea what tests to even order, but because I explained my family history of autoimmune disease, my symptoms, and I knew what tests I wanted, they did the tests I asked for. My ANA was speckled, 1:1280.\n\nFrom there I was referred to a rheumatologist who spent 45 minutes with me going over everything. He did another in depth panel. I had the RNP antibodies. There was my diagnosis. This took about a month total. \n\nI honestly think because I asked for the tests and was confident that something was wrong they took me seriously and I was able to get answers. I am also pretty lucky that I found doctors who just listened to me, but I know they are out there, you just have to keep searching! Best advice is to look out for yourself. Meaning, take time for yourself, find ways to accommodate. It is okay to be sad, overwhelmed and cry from time to time.\nAccomodating may also mean finding more accessible forms of sports than before and maybe having to change hobbies or gratification routines.\n\nSecond, find doctors that listen to you and take you seriously. I honestly felt worst when my GP would not follow my asking for a rheumatologist referral before diagnosis and when my second rheum I tried, even after diagnosis, completely dismissed me (HCQ? Quit that, just do sports!) and brushed off the lung involvement.\n\nThird, get into support communities, e.g. online or local rheumatoid associations etc. They also help you with validating you when your doctor is brushing you off or stalling and give you strength to keep pushing. Oh yes, I have also been there. I was treated for depression at the time of sudden joint pain onset, so I totally questioned myself as well.\nThe diagnosis was when I was already much better from other accommodations, but boy, what a relief, right xD ?\n\nBad thing was, that self-doubting came back full force when my second rheum I tried totally treated me like shit. So please take care that you have a supportive environment. I did not have a solid diagnosis for about 2 years while dealing with major flares (the most dangerous issues being pericarditis and pleuritis). MCTD is very difficult to diagnose and to treat because of it being an overlap syndrome, presenting symptoms from a few other CTDs, symptoms which can be somewhat unique to each individual. Even if you do get a MCTD/UCTD diagnosis, it is still a bit confusing because there are no actual treatment guidelines for these distinct conditions since no clinical studies have been done. It is not uncommon to feel as though you are sort of figuring things out as you go along, and this can be extremely frustrating, to say the least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, there is definitely hope, should you get this diagnosis. It may take you a long time to figure it out, but you can get there. For the most part, I am in flare remission at this point. I still have some lingering issues from previous flares (scar tissue), along with some daily issues like stiffness, tendonitis, etc., but nothing like the flares I had before we started to discover the correct treatment. Here are some of the things that really helped me out, and while they may sound simple, they have made an enormous difference collectively over time:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Cut out gluten completely (fixed my GI issues)  -Started lifting and exercising regularly (this helped a TON with the arthritis, as well as mental health)  -Eat healthy, especially less sugar (fish, greens, clean foods, etc)  -Get at least 8 hours of sleep every night  -Stop drinking alcohol (I find that this is pretty much like rocket fuel for inflammation). These were radical changes for me at the time, albeit simple ones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd my biggest piece of advice is to not fall into the trap of letting your condition define you. Accept the hand you have been dealt, believe you can feel better, and do everything in your power to improve your health. Hopefully everything works out for you! This is wonderful advice! Thank you for taking the time to write it all down! You mention several natural ways to keep your body flare free (which I absolutely love) but did you take any medication to help you get there or was it mostly diet and exercise? Read medical journal abstracts on   Look up definitions for technical jargon.  Read about every medication you are prescribed.  Put effort into being informed. There are no silver bullets, but there are many things that may help you incrementally. I seem to do ok with wine and cider in moderation, but liquor is no good, and beer is right out due to the gluten. Weed seems to help if used only intermittently and not smoked Sure thing. Yes, I take meds as well. I am on injectable methotrexate weekly, colchicine daily (to keep the pericarditis at bay), and omeprazole for GERD. I also have a flare protocol of prednisone should I need it. I tried plaquenil first for about a year or so, but that did not help. There was a lot of trial and error with meds (and flares) before we found something that seems to keep my flares in remission (without steroids). And to be clear, this is not a recommendation for you or anyone what, but simply an explanation of what works for me specifically. For me, switching to MTX and the daily colchicine was critical. Normally, colchicine is only recommended for 3-6 months, but I found that I would flare as soon as my treatment period ended. So, my cardiologist and rheumatologist agreed with my suggestion that it would be fine to try a daily dose, despite the lack of evidence. It is working. I definitely agree with what others have said - listen to your body closely, because it will sometimes hint at what it needs.\n\nWith that being said, the other things I mentioned have also had a huge positive impact cumulatively as well. Maybe one day I will try to get off MTX, but for now, the combination seems to be working. Honestly, sometimes I really consider my condition a blessing in disguise because I feel healthier and more in control than I ever have been. It woke me up and said, \"Hey, you really need to treat your body as your temple. Do not take your health for granted.\" Also, be aware that you can have no ANA and still have anti-RNP What exactly do you mean by intermittently? I have been testing CBD and THC strains but curious what has worked for you It seems like continuously using either THC or CBD is not effective.  Using THC long term seems to screw up my cognitive abilities, too. It may not be the same for everyone.", "Poll for the Community: Do you have children? Hello all, curious how many of us are parents, when you became parents, or if your illness has stopped you. *Please understand that this subject may be a trigger for some folks so let us keep comments supportive and thoughtful.*\n\n( I am a month post vasectomy with no children.  I have never felt like I have the energy for parenting.  I am doing ok generally, but a bad night's sleep or other mild (for normies) stressor will throw me off for days. I am \"one and done\". We always wanted two children, but after having our daughter I feel like my body cannot handle another pregnancy, birth and months of waking every 2-3 hours. I would rather be here for the one we have than risk anything happening if we had a second child. Lack of sleep destroys me as well (less than 7 hours bare minimum and it feels like part of my soul has been drained from my body) I had one child post diagnosis. I had complications with pregnancy towards the end, but had no trouble with fertility. If Plaquenil works to keep disease activity low I would like to try for one more but I am also coming to terms with being one and done since it is EXHAUSTING raising a kid with this condition.\n\nWe have a few years before we meet our goals of being ready for a second but I think if I am not ready for another pregnancy we may adopt an older child instead.", "Anyone get a random rash when they started MTX? (pics attached for reference) ", "back pain? I am 18 and have been having symptoms a little over a year and was diagnosed in february. When I was 15 I started to have these really bad back aches while sleeping. I only get them at night but the pain is so awful. It is not in one spot, it is my ENTIRE back. The skin, muscles and spine. It is such an awful pain because it is not sharp it is just a dull very severe pain. I cannot get comfortable and will just sit and cry because even after waking up and moving around it plagues me. I have started using cbd and thc tinctures before going to bed and have noticed a slight difference when it occurs. It does not occur every night. Maybe 3-4 times a month but when it does. It could drive me insane. Does anyone have the same or similar issues? Have you been screened for autoimmune diseases? yes I have mctd I have back/hip pain that flares up only when sitting, not lying down. But mine can be all over like you say. The only thing that helps is muscle relaxers and lying on one of those giant heating pads. I think mine is caused by muscle spasms because I get them all over. Have you tried muscle relaxers? I have not but maybe I will try them. I notice I get muscle spasms in random spots throughout the day pretty consistently so that makes sense. Thank you! I will let you know if I use them and if they help. Oh those little spasms are the worst. I have tried lots of meds to try and help but nothing seems to make them go away completely. But the muscle relaxers do give me some relief in my lower back. Back pain is so debilitating. I hope this works for you too!! Have you tried a muscle relaxer at night?", "Plaquenil is kicking in! I think my Plaquenil  is starting to kick in! I got diagnosed with UCTD in late November and have been taking Plaquenil for a little over two months. I do not know what happened once I hit the two month mark, but this week has been really good. My fatigue is my worst symptom, and I have actually had a decent amount of energy so far! The days have been up and down, though; some days I feel like crap and others I feel great. I am assuming that is just part of the process? If you also take Plaquenil, did that happen to you when it first started to kick in? Even if my weeks are split between good days and bad days for the rest of my life, I would consider it a victory. I have not woken up feeling well-rested in seven and a half years. It is great! I hope you are all doing well, and I am sending spoons! It took about 9 months to kick in for me. Slowly but surely I noticed my fingers looking less swollen and my leg muscles being less tired. \nI have been on it for almost four years and I still have good days and bad days, the majority are meh days but that is still a huge improvement on life before plaquenil. \nTwo months is still really early into taking it, so hopefully it will help more the longer you are on it. Wow\u2014 that is amazing that plaquenil worked. I never got the chance to see if it works. The side effects were to overbearing for me after like three months. Nausea became my alarm clock and the stomach pains stopped me from doing anything. What other treatments are you on? Is it just the plaqunil. I am on immunosuppressants and I have been on methotrexate, steroids, cell Cept and nothing has worked for me. I still feel the same- of course worse and better days. I have MCTD and also felt like it started working around the 2-month mark. My worst symptom was joint pain, and it is been amazing to not be constantly aching. I definitely still have flare-up days where I am super drained, but like you, I still consider the overall benefit a win. I have been on it for about 5 months now, and it does seem to continue to get better. I think it can be difficult to gauge since it is these tiny incremental changes over time. I heard 5-6 months to really kick in. That is great if it is. Are you on steroids as well?", "A long whiney rant... I have been encouraged by my therapist to seek out support forums so here goes nothing...\n\nWarning: Depressing stuff, suicide, mental health stuff... probably curse words...

If you are in a bad place mentally and do not want to wallow in it or feel worse, you probably should not read this.\n\nSomewhat recently diagnosed. Symptoms came on very quickly. Was lucky enough to have a primary care that ran the tests when I suggested autoimmune disease. Was in denial about the seriousness of it for a long time. Now after a ton of tests to determine the extent of my organ damage, I feel as if I am unable to see anything good or encouraging anymore.\n\nI feel very alone. I want to wrestle \"a why\" for me having this disease out of the universe and there is no why. It takes so much from you, and in the spiral down I get into a mindset that it is just a matter of time before it takes everything. And even then, for me, the time it takes from your life and your abilities to do things are the most precious things... So what is left besides a world that keeps on turning without regard to your imminent expedited end date.

It will not be in vain.  \nSecond, what diagnosis do you have specifically....or \u201cMCTD\u201d only\nThird, how much have you googled to bring you down to this level?\n\nI am 72, I have had flares, and I have lived (and am living) a full active life, after being diagnosed with MCTD in my 30\u2019s., back when it was first called Sharp\u2019s Syndrome.  \n\nWhat extent of organ damage do you have?  I have lost most motility in my esophagus, skin changes to my lower legs, with some discoloration, Sjogrens with dryness of mouth and eyes, and some joint pains, as well as fatigue. I am 33. I have diffuse scleroderma, SLE, and RA overlap.\n\nI have googled a lot of journal articles... No one tells you what to expect because it is so different for so many people. My most recent rheumatologist visit is what brought me down, actually...\n\nThe biggest issue I have is pulmonary hypertension with interstitial lung disease. I also have esophageal and digestive dysmotility, Reynauds, Sjogrens, continuous digital ulcers, and my recent tests indicate that I may now have the beginnings of kidney involvement. One of the worst articles about MCTD leaves people feeling that they only 5-10 years from diagnosis to death or disability. This is misleading, and untrue. \n\nOne of the first things that Dr. Sharp told me is that when you have MCTD, there is a good chance you will have less active disease.  I took that comment to bed with me for several years.  It has served as my mantra.\n\nI had no idea I had any esophageal involvement until after it happened. I have been on omeprazole since the 90\u2019s.  Your ulcers will heal, you will deal with the motility issues with trial and error. Your major organ involvement has been found, and will be addressed.  I am very impressed that you have a therapist already, and that is a great ally. \n\nIf you have a background of any trauma, this would be a good time to address those issues, too, because they can cause flares.  Ask your therapist about the book \u201cThe Body Keeps the Score \u201c.  \n\nAlso, Google the \u201cspoon theory\u201d for MCTD patients.   It will be a big help. \n\nWhat is your rheumy\u2019s treatment recommendation? I did some more thinking about your digital ulcers.  If you did not know you had Reynaud\u2019s, you might not have known what to do about them.  Is you rheumy working on those, too?  Do you live in a cold climate? Yeah, lung involvement is scary and most articles you find on that are very pessimistic.\n\nI would say it is okay to cry and be scared. But please trust your doctors and follow the therapy regimes.\nImmunosuppressants can slow the lung progression and only if it gets really bad, there are transplants, too.\nDid your doctor have an honest talk about life expectancy with you? I would really recommend asking them about it, pinning them on it (it is a serious topic for you!) and not to rely on the scary, scary Google results out there!\n\nEven if you feel like not doing anything any more, know that random strangers on the internet still care and tell you that you matter and you are worth it!\nIf you are looking for a support group, the AI Fam and Friends Discord might be a good pick for you ( or maybe even local support groups?\n\nIf you want to have therapy, a therapist specialized in chronic illness might be a better pick (there are a lot of therapists out there that see every isssue as psychological, which they clearly not all are for you). \nAntidepressants and autoimmune disease are usually not mutually exclusive and they can give you an upstart. Ask your psychiatrist about it if you want to try.\n\nAlso, it sounds stupid, but getting things done and having positive outlooks gets easier by doing things actively... there are more than enough online activities that are low threshold. I personally love regular board game and RPG groups.\nAnd physical activity can always start by gradually doing more and more with small incentives - e.g. go walk past a shop you really like.\n\nFeel hugged. This is hard but I trust you you can pull through, you sound very reflected. Thank you. Do you have any idea if the OP ever checked out any support groups? Sadly, they have not joined the Discord - or at least not posted anything there (there is an introduction thread).\n\nFrom the post, she is in therapy and that is a big first step!\n\nI hope OP will get better but with her deleting the account, we cannot contact her any more... :( Thank you.

This is my first post here so I am quite a newbie. I would really appreciate any help or advice :) I have already been diagnosed with celiac autoimmune disease just for background.\n\nMy symptoms have only been chronic fatigue, hair and eyebrow pain and hair loss, as well as a mild facial rash on my cheeks. My main symptoms is just that hair and scalp burning! I also have irregular periods and mid-cycle spotting. \n\nI DO NOT have any signs of joint inflammation or body pain and my CRP and ESR always come back in the low normal range.

One thing I noticed in there though is that sun avoidance is a HUGE thing for lupies and that it triggers most people to have a flare. Is this also true for MCTD? I am noticing that my heliotrope rash seems to get a little better when I avoid the sun, and that my skin thickening seems a bit better too. But it makes me sad to skip my hiking and kayaking even when I am feeling pretty good. What have you guys found? Are you sun sensitive? Yes\n\nIf I go into the sun for more than a few minutes my malar rash gets worse and I eventually feel cruddy\n\nI stick to the shade and wear sunglasses (I have blue eyes that are sensitive to the sun) \n\nYou can try sunscreen but I do not like it so I just avoid the sun if I can. Thanks for letting me know. I hate sunscreen too! It is so greasy and no matter what the bottle says it gets all over my clothes and my car. I feel you on that. I am happy that my symptoms are getting better but I have to be honest I was hoping it was mainly the plaquenil not the sun avoidance. But I notice that when I do both I am like 90% well so I am guessing that I should just suck it up and stay indoors for a bit. If you are on plaquenil you should avoid the sun anyway \ud83d\ude43 but talk to your doctor about vitamin D if you skip the sun  Holy cow! My doctor did not even tell me this. He just mentioned getting the eyes tested. Thanks for passing this along. I love the sun and still go hiking, camping, swimming, etc. I have been intermittently sun-sensitive in the past. I once got full-body hives, but more often get just a strange, cold/tingly feeling in my skin if I do not wear sunscreen. There is also always the concern that sun exposure will trigger more disease activity. I do not know whether that is been the case for me - I am not aware of a direct trigger effect in my own body, but it is possible I would have less disease activity overall if I completely avoided it. \n\nThat said, for me it is too important to my quality of life - my mental health and my physical well-being both - for me to be willing to avoid the sun completely. I have gotten much better about wearing sunscreen when I go out. It is true for me..  I have been sun-sensitive since birth, really prone to sun poisoning. But the onset of MCTD brought hives from sun exposure, and just 15-20 minutes could trigger a flare up of inflammation. Being on Plaquenil and Benlysta - made me even extra sensitive. FUN. I also LOVE nature. I love to hike and bird watch, and all the things. \n\nI do wear (and reapply) SPF 100+ every day (that I go outside, even for a little bit), I wear the UPF protectant clothing when I am out for longer (like camping, cookouts, etc), and hats, sunglasses, etc. I actually wear a long sleeve &amp; long pant UPF swimsuit when swimming. Where do you get that type of swimsuit?  I am newly diagnosed and have horrible heat intolerance and rashes all of the sudden but loved to swim laps at the pool. I got mine (a swimsuit, swim capris, a sundress, and a long sleeve top) all from this website (  They are expensive. I waited for sales and found a coupon and bought pieces one at a time, but so far - each one has been totally worth it. The bathing suit, especially.  I got this one (  and I wear the black swim leggings with it. I felt silly the first couple times (I am overweight, so I felt like I had a real Shamu look going on) But its really just like a wetsuit, and I have gotten many compliments! Thank you!!! This is helpful!  I might check that suit out. I am with you on this! I feel like I have to get out a little. One thing I am trying--since some folks mentioned I should avoid the sun given I am taking plaquenil--is getting out early in the am when the UV rays are not so bad. Just in case that helpful to you. I LOVE to be outdoors as well. Hiking is my jam. And now the medication is helping with my fatigue and muscle pain, I really do want to get back to exploring waterfalls and kayaking! Hey--I know this post is older but I do not come online that often. I have stopped around and found what I think are good uv clothing &amp; hat options (Athleta, REI in addition to stores listed by other commenters). I also picked up some UV sensitive bracelets online just to gain a relative awareness of sun on an overcast day vs a bright one, shade, and even different indoor/shaded environments after I experienced face redness on a road trip. I try to schedule my excursions towards morning &amp; evening sun, when I can.\n\nOne trick I have not seen on this and similar subs is window tinting. It is a relatively inexpensive way to limit uv exposure, and I think it helps my symptoms. Best of luck to you, OP! I love the outdoors, too! I just tinted my windows and it is such a great idea! Now my car is one less place I have to hide from the sun. I am definitely checking out protective clothing and bought an spf umbrella too!", "Covid vaccine advice  Just got my first shot today!

Hope it makes you feel better and do not forget those eye check ups! Interesting that you mention that! I went to my ophthalmologist to get pre-authorization for the prescription because of my existing eye issues, and he did a huge eye roll and said it is never been seen before being on it for over 10 years. \nI mean I will still get my regular checks, but he did not want to see me before a year.\n\nEdit: he is also a grouchy old man, who I probably will not go see again. I totally get that, but at the same time every eye doctor I have seen in the past 6 years that I have taken it has been, \u201cbetter safe than sorry!\u201d I honestly do not go every year on the dot, but I would for sure be looking for a new doctor! My vision is like the only thing that works properly at this point, I are not messing around \ud83d\ude02 Haha! Right....?!? Minus having to wear glasses, for me at least.\nI actually got a bad scratch on my cornea last year (enter ophthalmologist) and already have an issue with my iris pigment dispersing into my eye. Shocker that I have a connective tissue issue in my eyes. NOT! \ud83d\ude05 Ahhhh shit, I forgot about that. Yeah, my eyes have been terrible vision wise since I was about 10, but my whole family is like that so I figure it was just luck of the draw. I did not even know you could have a connective tissue issue in your eye, but it totally makes sense. Damn. Nothing is safe \ud83d\ude02 Love Dr. Darien! Great educator on IG. He really is! This live with Phillip was great! He even got emotional talking about how the pandemic anniversary we just had hit him differently than the rest of us. \n\nSomeone else on the original lupus post commented that there is no data to back this info up. But Dr Darien is so much a facts guy! Even in this live Phillip was like \u201ctook you a while to answer that, make it quicker!\u201d And Dr D responded something like \u201cit is science, there is no making it quicker when explaining it\u201d. I think the new protocol is once a year for those appointments. I have also heard rumors that the dosing recommendations have changed so the toxicity/vision stuff is at a much lower risk due to the lower doses I believe you are correct! But I think they typically want you to see them 6 months after starting, then yearly after that. Ya. They want to get a baseline before or soon after you start then just follow up yearly or something Got mine (J&amp;J). No problems. Yeah, I am going to list all the names of people who have died.\n\nEdit:  collecting these now. Names are not available, obviously", "Do not know where to start Hello! I was just recently diagnosed with MCTD. After doing some online research (never doing that again,lol) I grew worried reading a statistic that the survival rate for MCTD goes down after 10 years. Can you tell me how long you have been dealing with MCTD symptoms? Well, I have been diagnosed for 5 years so far. I think those statistics online are quite a bit out of date and I was also told so by my rheumatologist, too. Most things you read on the internet is the worst case scenario. Many with this disease have a mild or moderate form and little to no organ involvement. \n\nI was so worried when I was first diagnosed, too. Once time passes you will have a better idea how aggressive this condition is for you. Medicine is the best it has been for us, so many live fulfilling and long lives! Hi there!\nFirstly, there are all different ways to measure survival. I will not go into them all now but I will give a brief overview as to why you should not be too worried.\n\nSurvival rates are usually given as the %age of people alive after a certain length of time after diagnosis or treatment. So a ten year survival rate of 90% means that 90% of people with the condition will be alive after ten years. A 80-90% 10 year survival rate (which is where I think MCTD is) is pretty good. The disease is chronic and life limiting but not particularly lethal like cancer. \n\n\nIt is also worth remembering that the 'survival' of the general population goes down as people either get older and die, or die because of other conditions or events. In five or ten years time, some percentage of people alive now will be dead. That is going to vary geographically. \n\nPretend, for example, after receiving a diagnosis, you could say that eg 80% of people are alive 10 years later. That 20% decrease looks scary but if you also know what percentage of the general population are alive in 10 years you can better appreciate the risk. In this pretend example, if we find that 85% of the general population are alive in 10 years time (compared to 80% of people with the condition) it does not seem as startling. These numbers are not based on fact BTW just a toy example.\n\nHope this helps! Also, since the study ended after 10 years, we have no idea how long the rest of them lived!  I am 71, and I have been diagnosed for 35+ years.  I have had it longer, and the damage was done early.  Your best bet is Mayo Clinic for online info, and the MCTD site. The biggest concern for survival when it comes to MCTD is the effect the disease has on your pericardium sac and whatever the one around your lungs is called. In reality, many people with MCTD have little to no symptoms there. And the sooner you are diagnosed, the better your chances are of survival, especially as time goes on and more treatments are found.\n\nI have been diagnosed for almost 5 years (at age 23), but according to my doctors and tests and so forth, my life expectancy is unaffected by the MCTD. The stress of life with an autoimmune disorder is a different matter. However, given family history, even factoring in stress and other things, I fully expect to live until my 70s and I am ok with that. I became ill in 2016 and was diagnosed a year later. Looking back, I have had symptoms since my teens (I am now 34). Thanks to all! It is nice to get some information and experiences from others with this. This is all new to me and I am a little overwhelmed, but I love the support in this group. diagnosed since i was 11 - 20 now! so far i would say i am pretty alive", "Short Answer Sunday: Do you have RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) symptoms? Give us the short answer....but feel free to expand in the comments!\n\n\\**If you comment, consider starting with the answer you selected either \\ or \\. But no pressure if you would like your vote to stay anonymous.*\n\n( I have primary RA, fwiw. Have joint pain, but lacking the necessary markers for diagnosis. So I am part of the MCTD fam. RA symptoms are my most prominent My main symptoms are SLE related but RA is a close second. Joint pain, stiffness and redness, especially in my hands.  I struggle with RA daily! It was not my first symptom but I remember the day it started. First it was just some faint swelling in my right hand and then my left. From there it spread to each set of my major joints in the same pattern - first my right (shoulder/jaw/hip/insert joint here) then my left. I am still on that journey too since this month it started to hit my lower extremity joints (knee/foot), which I secretly held out hope that it would not happen - shame on me. It is definitely a constant reminder that I am not the healthy young adult I once was and I once took for granted. I will likely try Plaquenil soon to see if that helps. No, thankfully. I do have joint pain, but no RA markers in my bloodwork. My rheumatologist thinks my joint pain is primarily from hypermobility, which is unrelated to my MCTD but an added \u201cbonus\u201d.", "Poll for the Community: How frequent are your flares? When I was first diagnosed I did a lot of research (still do) on what to expect with MCTD. One common misinterpretation I stumbled into is that MCTD, like many other autoimmune illnesses, is characterized by flares of symptoms. In the early days I noticed myself having flares seasonally. However, as my illness progresses I notice that the flares seemed to wash out into the daily chronic pain I experienced. Of course I still had good and bad days but I felt like I was almost having \u201cflares\u201d of good days and the bad days were the new normal. I now know that flares are extremely different from person to person in length, severity, and symptoms. I am curious, what your flares are like? Specifically, how often they occur if not daily? If daily, how often are your \u201cgood-day flares\u201d?\n\n*Forgive me, this one was a bit tricky to capture in only a few poll choices. As always, choose the best answer and feel free to expand in the comments!*\n\n( Short answer: both. I used to get flares about every three months for the first three years or so. The reason I went to the doctor initially was for my first flare, although it took a year or so to determine that is actually what it was. For me, flares consist of pleuritis and pericarditis as my main symptoms. After we found the correct meds, I am effectively in flare remission. I did have one pop up last year due to stress, but prednisone and self care effectively prevented it from spiraling into permanent damage. With that being said, I also have daily symptoms. Those being general stiffness, GERD, occasional mild arthritis/tendinitis, and mild pain during deep breathing from scar tissue (from my worst flare). I do not want to jinx it, but right now, things are going well and I believe this is my baseline. I am grateful, all things considered. That is very good to hear. Im glad your daily symptoms are manageable and allow you to live your life. It takes time to find the \u201cnew normal\u201d and be accepting of it but it sounds like you have found yours :) I went with other because there are times I just cannot tell. Sometimes my flares are mild enough to be mistaken for having a cold or they could be chalked up to ibs.\nMy bad flares are miserable. I initially mistook having covid for having a flare.\nAt times, I feel like I am stuck in a flare for so long that it ceases to be a flare and becomes my new normal.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed, I downloaded an app that enabled me to mark flare days but it just became depressing and confusing. I still track my symptoms but I have switched to an app that does not leave me feeling depressed because of the number of days that are marked with a flare. Instead it gives me information that helps me and my doctors look at patterns and triggers.\nI have stopped focusing on when I am flaring and instead try to hang on to the days that are good where I feel semi normal. This is great advice! I would love to know the app you are now using. I just downloaded one myself the other day since I used to keep a symptom journal but that got depressing too. I use Bearable, it is free but there is a premium option. They have a subreddit so you can check them out and ask questions r/BearableApp. My symptoms are much more RA oriented than anything else and I am very lucky to have caught everything early so for me a flare is comparatively pretty mild. \n\nGenerally once a month or so I will have a 3-5day stretch where I am absolutely useless from fatigue, brain fog, and general inflammation in my joints and GI tract. And if I happen to go to the doctor during this time he likes to get some tests and it is so cool to me (well not cool I wish I did not have to deal with this but as cool as it can be)  to see how during these times my results are lit up like a Christmas tree, my doctor's also marvel at how insanely reactive my results are.\n\nFrom day to day though, I have my mornings where it takes a little extra to stand up or wiggle my fingers. Days where I start off using my cane and end the day complete fine or vice versa. But for the most part I am so lucky to live an albeit less comfortable but overall average life. I like to tell my friends to treat me like a mostly healthy 72yr old haha. Thanks for the recommendation! I am using bearable now. Soooo much better than the one I had originally downloaded! I am really glad you have found it helpful.", "My Rheum said I may have mctd what confirmed your diagnosis? I have:\n\npositive ds-dna\nArthritis presenting as RA\nRaynauds and hand swelling\nThyroid antibodies \nTested negative for lupus \n31F\n\nWhat confirmed your diagnosis? They said my other organs are fine and everything is perfect otherwise. I think the snRNP is conclusive for MCTD. Do you mean you would need that to be positive to confirm it? I think so. I believe (and I could be wrong) the snRNP differentiates between Mixed Connective Tissue Disease and Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease Lupus is a huge part of MCTD, but to be diagnosed I believe you have to have at least two of the 3 big ones - Lupus, Scleroderma, and Polymyositis. \n\nThis is from the nih.gov website:\n\u201cMixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare autoimmune disease diagnosed when a specific antibody known as anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein is present, and there are features of at least two connective tissue diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis. \u201c\n\n I do not have the tests in front of me, but there was an ANA test with a \u201cspeckled pattern\u201d that was the final deciding factor on mine. I have no organ involvement, primary is hand swelling. No one here can diagnose you. Please reach out to your rheum and let them explain the diagnosis or hypothesis to you.  \n\n\nLaughorcryliveordie is right in that U1 RNP antibodies usually have to be present to diagnose MCTD.  \n\n\nHowever, snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) antibodies consist of two different testable fractions: U1 RNP and Smith (Sm) antibodies.  \n\n\nYou can either test those two together in a test or run them separately.  \n\n\nU1 RNP is present in the majority of MCTD patients but can also frequently occur in SLE and scleroderma.  \n\n\nAnti Sm antibodies, however, are pretty much only occuring in SLE, so that is rather a reason not to diagnose MCTD - same with dsDNA antibodies. My rheum reclassified me from MCTD to SLE bc I had some borderline positive Sm antibodies.  \n\n\nOf course, being classified SLE also has perks bc there are more therapies available and connective tissue diseases, especially SLE and MCTD have huge overlaps in symptoms and treatments, all the more if you do not have organ involvement yet. I have seen my rheum every single week for the past month, he said it takes a long time to officially diagnose I am asking for what is happened to other people in similar situations with similar bloodwork/symptoms not a diagnosis, I do not expect one from rheums rn let alone Reddit Tested negative for everything except the U1-RNP antibody and had symptoms. From the research I have done, if you do not have this antibody, it pretty much rules out mctd. My symptoms are fatigue, acid reflux, muscle pain and joint pain. From research I am done, some people with UCTD can test positive the RNP antibody (or any of the other ENA antibodies) and if they still do not meet the symptom criteria, they will still be diagnosed with UCTD. I did watch a doctor on YouTube who said many people with UCTD do evolve into MCTD tho. Ty Interesting. Thank you. I just got diagnosed today but I am skeptical because they only did the ANA test. I have all the same symptoms as you though. They for sure cannot diagnose anything without further testing. ANA testing is soooo unspecific and many healthy people have it. I am pretty sure the ds-dna test is specific for lupus so I am not sure why you have been diagnosed with MCTD without a positive RNP antibody. My rheum said 99-100% of people with MCTD test positive for it so a negative RNP pretty much rules out MCTD. My guess is maybe you do not meet the criteria for lupus so they are trying to diagnose you with an \u2018unknown unspecific\u2019 autoimmune disease. I read online that some rheumatologists use MCTD and UCTD (undifferentiated connective tissue disease) interchangeably but they should not actually do that since MCTD has a specific antibody and UCTD does not. They both just happen to have similar symptoms. That seems to be what I am reading in various articles too, I am definitely going to get a referral to specialist. I am not loving how my doc handled this, his receptionist called me and dropped that bomb on me and then could not explain anything. Really terrible way to start my day\u2026 Yeah that is really unprofessional of them! I would definitely recommend getting a referral to a specialist, and I hope they take you more seriously and do extensive tests. There may be rare cases of U1 negative MCTD patients but it is sooo unlikely. At the end of the day, a ton of autoimmune diseases have overlapping symptoms and a lot of the treatments are the same so in many cases, having a specific diagnosis is not the most important thing. In my opinion, the most important thing a doctor can do is take your symptoms seriously and recognizes that you have some form of autoimmunity going on, regardless of a diagnosis.", "Am I in the right place? I am 34. Symptoms:joint pain,fatigue, and been getting sick with various things for 1.5yrs(have had shingles 2x in that time)  Hi! You are blood results look similar to mine except my lymphocytes were high and my neutrophils were low normal. I am still in the process of getting diagnosed but I am currently on 20 mg of prednisone a day for a week and then tapering off the next week! \n\nMy rheumatologist wants to see how I react to the medication and so far it has helped tons! I feel like old self. \n\nMy RNP is 1.7 but I have been told that is not high enough for a diagnosis of MCTD. Have you been to a rheumatologist yet? No I am still waiting on a referral to see a rheumatologist. But while I am waiting I am trying to learn more about it, treatment, what to expect etc. do you by chance have the butterfly face rash? I have read it is usually accompanied by the rash which I do not have. I do not have any skin problems or Raynaud's syndrome. Just wondering where I fit in lol Also do you have any throat issues? For years I feel like there is pressure like mildly being choked Esophagus issues (dysmotility) are common with mctd.\n\nMctd is comprised of Systemic Lupus, Scleroderma, and polymyositis. It can also have some overlap with other autoimmune diseases, because it is technically an umbrella term that is used for people with specific symptoms.\n\nRaynauds is not a guaranteed ailment. It is common though and can develop at any time. Cold temperatures (or holding an ice cube or a cold drink or a pint of ice cream for instance) as well as stress can cause a Raynauds episode. I usually get it during winter if I go outside (Minnesota) so I wear thick fuzzy mittens and wool socks. It can affect any extremity- including ears, nose, and nipples. It sucks.\n\nThe rash or butterfly rash is a common symptom of Lupus. Your results appear to not have much Lupus involvement from what I see which could explain why you have no rash, but I am not a doctor. I have had the butterfly \u201crash\u201d for years even while on medication and after treating it with hydrocortisone cream (doctors suggestion). It is less of a rash for me and more of just redness across my cheeks and nose that comes and goes. If I go in the sun the redness comes immediately. People with Lupus can be sensitive to the sun, and medication we are put on can make that worse. Undifferentiated Mctd here. Your results are similar to mine, although my abs neutrophils and WBC get much higher. I also had shingles in my first 2 year long flare at about 35 years old. My first dx was Myasthenia, but specific antibody tests for that came back negative. After multiple sub-specialists for MG, I was diagnosed with mctd. Your rheumatologist will order more specific tests. All of mine for lupus, scleroderma,  leukemia, etc came back neg, but with symptoms, mctd was kind of the catch-all in my case. I hope you find some answers and something to relieve the symptoms. \n\nMost prominent symptoms were severe joint pain, dysphagia, and dysphonia. I could not speak or swallow due to weakness for almost 6 months. My sed rate and inflammation markers are normal but my RNP is 7.9 and my dsDNA is also highly positive. I do not have the butterfly rash. Pretty sure I did for a few months about 6 years ago but we chalked it up to rosasea. I have joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, muscle weakness and fatigue, swallowing issues and my voice goes out easily. I am fairly newly diagnosed and my rheumatologist is still ordering tests before starting me on Plaquenil. I actually do not have a butterfly rash but I get other type of rashes! My other symptoms are -Light sensitivity \n-Joint pain in kneecaps, wrists, elbows and ankles\n-Frequent urination\n-When it is cold I get itchy in my inner thighs when I walk and get hives.

The results for an anti-rnp test (positive) disappeared from my record. These records were suppose to go to my pcm and I was going to use these results for future  rheumatologists office visits. I am pretty annoyed by this. I do not  want to start all over. What the hell? I would certainly call and ask but no, that is straight up bullshit. That does not sound right. Seems odd that they would delete patient files unless it had been a long time since you would seen them. Do you have any correspondence regarding the blood results? Your insurance paid the lab. So if the MD deletes the results, that could be considered fraud which could result in massive fines/prison etc. You can call the MD and demand them. If they do not make them available, you can contact the insurance company. They should be able to get that information. If you get nowhere, tell the MD you will contact the State board of medicine. That would likely result in a rapid response. If you know the laboratory and the date you took the test they can potentially email you the results. WHAT. That must be illegal....come on wth. I am so sorry I hope I am mistaken.  I will  send a message today to have so I have a personal copy of contact and call them. Yeah. I had the appt right before moving so it feels like a mess to me. I will call them and message  them about it. I have never experienced records disappearing. I hope I am mistaken. Thanks I will do that too! Thank you everyone.

I have had this several times over the past 6 years. It is most prominent after I pee in the middle of the night, by the time I am back in bed I am in agony. Last night was the worst it has ever been. It is like a hot ember is placed in my right side and it just burns. I was diagnosed with MCTD about a year ago but I have had a variety of symptoms for years. I am wondering if is related to my MCTD. Honestly, that could be so many things - from costochondritis to kidney issues. Please see your GP as soon as you can. Sounds like what happened to me when I had kidney stones.  Definitely tell a doc. I have this. It feels like my ribs are broken some days the pain is so bad.. I have had several tests that did not reveal anything that it could be. I have not been able to find a link or a trigger for it. I just made some dietary changes so I will see if that has an impact. Very painful for sure! Thanks for your response I had an ultrasound and did not reveal stones but this has crossed my mind that maybe very small stone(s) are being passed. Thanks for your response and I will speak with my doctor about the possibility Yea I am not sure what it is. Do not understand it! But I definitely feel it!!! Let me know if you end up finding anything\u2026 is interesting", "15 years old, doctor believes i have mctd but i dont want anymore testing I am 15 and my rheumatologist believes i have MCTD. I had mono back in early November 2019 and it has never fully gone away. I am always tired and in pain. I was tested for Lupus, MS, and some other things. All came back negative. However it turns out my RNP markers came back positive on one test. But it was negative on a less sensitive test. My rheumatologist wants to run more tests to see if its positive again, but I do not want anymore testing. I am scared but I will probably just wait until any symptoms get worse. Is this a bad idea?  Yes, a bad idea.  Get the blood tests.  Knowledge is power and fear is emotionally draining.  I am 71, and I wish I had known earlier. Ok, thank you so much. I will talk to my doctor :) Yes it is a bad idea to wait. It took my doctor's and I years to figure out my diagnosis and treatment. During that time, I resisted taking prednisone during a particularly bad flare because I was naive and thought I could push through it (and was \"afraid\" of the side effects). I was wrong, and now I have permanent scarring on my pleura which gives me a slight pain every time I take a deep breath. It is a reminder to me that doctors, by and large, weigh the risk versus benefit and try their best to give you the right answers. It is your responsibility to decide whether or not to listen. Oh thank you so much! I did not even think about the long-term effects this could cause if it is MCTD. I will definitely get the blood test then :). Thanks again! Hang in there. I know the testing can be draining  and it is a lot to deal with emotionally at 15. What do your parents say? Before I was diagnosed I also had mono which seemed to last for months. After months of clean diet and plenty of sleep I started to feel better and thought I had kicked the mono. However, after one month of feeling healthy again (and back to my usual diet and partying), my MCTD symptoms started. I believe the mono was the last straw that set off my MCTD - it is been thought to trigger autoimmunes from what I have read. I wish I had known, maybe I would not have taken my health-spurt days for granted. It is best to know. You are young which ultimately gives you power! Changing your diet and routine early could maybe change the course of your illness if you do have an autoimmune. I have MCTD too. The medications can make a huge difference in your pain and energy levels. They can also prevent organ damage. Please take care of yourself. That Is exactly how I felt! I had the worse case of mono and once I had finally gotten better, it felt like I had relapsed. As for my parents, they seem pretty overwhelmed as well. My mom definitely wants me to do the blood test as it has been months of nonstop testing and we just now figured out what it could be. I guess I am just scared that it may come back negative and I am going to have to go through more months of testing. However, after reading some the comments\u2019 stories, I would rather like to get the test and save myself from any irreversible damage. I also did not even think about how a healthier diet could improve my symptoms as well. I will definitely have to research and try it out. Thank you so much :) You are so welcome! If you do have MCTD it is not the end of the world - though it is completely normal to feel like it is. It does sound like you are going through something similar to my initial symptoms. If you have MCTD, you are lucky to have found this group so early since there is a lot to learn about how your body works. Diet is a huge part, as is your mental state and environment (you will see once you start researching). It is a lot, especially at 15 but it can also be very interesting. I am light years ahead of any of my friends when it comes to knowledge about how to be healthy, appreciate life even when bad things happen, etc. I feel for your mom too, she is in a difficult situation as she wants to protect you but likely feels helpless to do so. A diagnosis puts everyone is mind at ease. Maybe your mom should hop on reddit \ud83d\ude05 The possibility of organ damage definitely is scary. I would rather just take a small blood test and get the medication than wait it out. Thank you so much! :) Life is teaching you early how to stand up for yourself. It can be a blessing in disguise As someone who was 14 when going through this process I FEEL YOU! I was so tired of all the testing, docs visits, and anxiety seeping from my parents. It is stressful but get the tests\u2014Knowing will help, meds will help, being hooked into a provider who deals specifically with your illness will help. Waiting until the symptoms are worse may mean long-term damage. You need your organs for another 60-70 years do not gamble with them! The name of the game is to prevent any damage. Please look into the Facebook mctd group too. They have great resources. If you have MCTD (and at this point it is still a big if) you need to get on top of it early. The sooner you know, the sooner your doctor can start figuring out how to help you feel as well as possible.\n\nI do not want to scare you and I understand that doctors appointments and testing are not pleasant, but if you let it get worse, you could be setting yourself up for long term problems that could potentially be avoided.\n\nI hope it turns out not to be MCTD and if it is, I hope it is mild enough that with treatment, it does not bother you at all.

No , is fibromyalgia a real thing ? I heard it just something doctors say when they do not want to do further investigation It is real. That is very old info. There are many possibilities besides lupus, that oudont be my first guess tbh. A rheumatologist is what you need. Good.  A good diagnosis depends on a good health team, which would include a rheumatologist who listens, as well as a neurologist, a psychiatrist or psychologist, a pulmonologist, dermatologist, and perhaps internal medicine specialist, who all discuss the case with each other.  If your rheumatologist is not sympatico, keep searching. I am sorry if I have missed something but how do you know you have lupus if your blood results are normal? \n\nYou do not look crazy - you are experiencing something common and frustrating that lots of people go through while trying to get a diagnosis. \nI highly recommend talking to your doctor about fibromyalgia which would fit with your symptoms and would not show up on blood work. \nIt is tiring and frustrating but hang in there and eventually you will get answers. ( ( ( Because I heard that lupus takes years to show up on a blood test In some cases Ok, that makes sense.

Because I do not have a summer rn due to what is happening to me There are many inflammatory illnesses that are not autoimmune you should definitely look into. Are all your autoimmune markers normal also? It is definitely real.. there are also some other neurological illnesses that are not autoimmune but may describe your symptoms also.", "Do you have any hobbies that keep you going? I am a performing artist who plays with fire. I have just started aerial silks too. Nothing as exciting as you! Cross stitch and gardening. Beat saber in VR has been great for me. It takes the boredom out of exercise and it is fun and addictive. I am usually so into it that I do not even notice any symptoms Love that!!! That is how I feel when I am flowing too. I also love beat savor Love gardening as well! What are your favorite plants? I have always wanted to try cross stitching but never got around to it. I am a goddamn lot into TTRPGs since I moved to the big city.\n\nPlayed in two weekly D&amp;D campaigns until last Sunday (now still one and looking to join a VtM short campaign) and run another weekly D&amp;D campaign.\n\nIt is great bc it also works with flares (as long as it is not brain fog). Cross stitching is one of those great activities for high pain days because you can sit there and zone out while you are doing it. \nI love succulents. Actually, I love all plants but succs are by far my favourites. How about you? Oh I bet it is great for those kinds of days. I have got to give it a try. I too, love succulents. One of my favorite plants is my calla Lilly. Her name is Cali, and she is got a sister named Lilith. Unlike her sister she is giant with spotted leaves. I cannot keep callas alive! They are beautiful, they just hate me lol I am glad I am not the only one who names their plants! I somehow got lucky. I actually need to replant her since she is growing so fast Lol all of my plants are named. I have a a milkweed for butterfly\u2019s, and her name is butters. Hahaha my aloe is Veronica. I have a fern named Franny. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Niiiice!!! I never got into D&amp;D but have been interested. It is seems to have a cool community too.", "How often do your hands and feet change color? Mine do 2-4 times a day. It is not unusual for my fingers to turn purple and it stays this way from anywhere between 5min to an hour. \n\nI am trying to figure out whatnormal raynauds looks like. Is 2-4 times a day excessive? If I do not take my meds, my hands will cycle through their color changes basically all day if I am anywhere below about 72 degrees F. I take sildenafil (aka viagra), which works for about 3-4 hours usually if I am indoors. I take it up to three times a day, so I often still have multiple episodes of color change (or just stuck on purple) when it starts to wear off. I see people noticing it - sometimes they comment and sometimes they just stare/look away. It is by far the most visible sign of my illness. \n\nWhat you describe sounds pretty severe for the general population of people with Raynaud\u2019s without a co-existing autoimmune disease. I think those folks often have just one finger affected and only when it is really cold. But based on my understanding of MCTD it seems like Raynaud\u2019s is often pretty prominent, so your experience is maybe more typical for someone with our diagnosis. I have to keep my house at 74F or else I lose color in my toes almost guaranteed. If it happens I stop what I am doing and warm them up so it only lasts maximum 30 min. But happens in the morning, afternoon, and evening without bias. Only recently have my toes started to turn blue during my episodes. It is definitely a daily if not hourly problem for me. My fingertips stay purple and spend too much time dead white. When the corpse finger thing happens to me it can last for hours. My fingertips are rapidly defleshing and nothing seems to slow it down. Typing and anything involving water have become difficult. I am guessing mine is severe. This sounds really terrible! If your fingers are staying white for long periods without at least turning purple then they are not getting any blood flow or oxygen at all. I worry you will have really bad damage from this. \n\nAre you on any meds? My meds have not gotten rid of it, but it is a lot better than before. I also find electric hand warmers help. And based on your username I wonder if you drink a lot of coffee/soda? Caffeine is one of my worst triggers. If you do use it, i wonder if it would be worth cutting back. \n\nSorry you are dealing with this. Mine also hurts a lot after my fingers have been in corpse pose for a while, but I actually hate the numbness the most. Trying to get my credit card out at the grocery store after I have been through the freezer section is like trying to pick up a needle with two dead fish! It varies. Generally the colour returns pretty quickly and they do not often go purple, just white then red. \nI am so used to it happening that I do not think I could tell you how many times a day it happens. There are days, especially when I am tired and stressed, where they just stay white and red regardless of what I do. My finger nails also turn mauve. I am on meds for many things including this, and they are very damaged as it is. If they cannot reverse it, I will end up struggling with infections and partial amputations. But so far, nothing seems to help. And I LOVE coffee but I keep it to 2 cups a day and no espresso at all. I used to drink so much, but it is been years now, my stomach would not allow it now lol. Thank you so much for your concern, you are very kind! I hate when they are dead numb, but for me the pain is worse. Parts of the bone begin to ache because it is starved for blood too. Ugh. Today is not too bad. Is there any chance OT visiting a wound healing clinic for some hyperbaric oxygen treatment? If they get bad enough, maybe. I am in a rural place and there is not a lot in the way of health care. I drive 45 minutes to see a rheumatologist, distance driving not city driving. So I am not sure they would bother. But I will ask. I am not thrilled that they shrug their shoulders and say, and least they are not infected, when I show them the latest damage. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you Has your rheumatologist ever suggest meds for the Reynaud\u2019s?  And keeping your core warm and your head covered?  And your hands hydrated? Yes, and yes, and definitely yes. But thank you so much! I eat very carefully with health in mind and drink lots of water too. I exercise a few times a week, which is not enough but it is better than nothing. I am determined to do my best to fight whst may be inevitable as much as I can. It gives me peace. Wow, you are doing everything you can.  Good for you. I will say I am 72, and after menopause, it did seem to get better.  Also, I \u201cfixed\u201d some of the trauma of my past, and that also made a difference, either in the disease, or in the way my body responded to it.  I hope you have years and years of peace. I do love mauve, but not when it is the body! Lol! Thank you for sharing!!! Thank you for sharing. It is by far my most visible symptom as well and people definitely notice it. Sucks! Seems like the severity of mine does not seem too unusual for MCTD, you are right. Same!! My heater is always on! And I live in freggin SoCal! I wear gloves out kuz I have too and people look at me sooo funny. \ud83d\ude44 I am so sorry to hear that. I have had a digital ulcer on my middle finger all year. It sucks!!!! I really hope the drs can find something to help you. I would also suggest massage therapy! Helps a lot with blood flow and circulation. I know we cannot really do that right now because of covid but look into it once it is all over. Thank you for sharing this!", "Left Rheumatologist tentative diagnosis So I just left a rheumatology appointment with a tentative diagnosis. He was big on calling it a SLE-like disease. I asked him to elaborate so I can say what it is to others namely relatives who do not even know I have some health issues. He said that right now I have UCTD. He is using UCTD a placeholder until a more specific AI shows up which I hope never happens. He will be treating me with plaquenil. I did have high RNP antibodies (7.4) but I am okay with the UCTD diagnosis as he will actually be giving me treatment. I have an appt in late Jan to see if the plaquenil is tolerable. Does anyone else have this diagnosis? My understanding -- and I posted peer-reviewed journal articles that support this earlier in this subreddit but am too lazy to go back and look them up -- is that lupus-like symptoms and a high anti-RNP are definitely indicative of mixed connective tissue disease.  Medical practitioners, who are often not fully up to speed on the literature for this disease because it is rare, seem to be hung up on not diagnosing it for some reason. However, I would not be too worried about putting a label on it if the doctor is providing plaquenil. Yeah........ I saw your article. I am getting treatment for an autoimmune disease so I am not bothered whether it is called UCTD instead of MCTD. I would just like whatever it is to not progress to Lupus or Systemic Sclerosis. I have (tentatively) MCTD, thankfully I do not have the lung or skin involvement, but that is the diagnosis we have to work with. I am on plaquenil, meloxicam, imuran and vit D. My main complaint are my wrists, but that is almost back to a normal. I was diagnosed a year ago, but I feel so much better now. My goal is remission. I share your understanding that high anti-RNP antibodies is pretty specific for MCTD, and have also had the experience where rheumatologists do not seem to think the specific diagnosis matters too much. That is problematic, though, because the complication risks are different for the different diseases. For instance, people with MCTD are much less likely to develop kidney disease than someone with SLE, whereas people with MCTD are at higher risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. So different surveillance labs and imaging are indicated depending on which diagnosis you have. My rheumatologist did not consider ordering screening echocardiograms (for PAH) or imaging for interstitial lung disease until I pressed her on it, because I still carry the SLE diagnosis even though my high anti-RNP and symptoms are very consistent with MCTD. Does the treatment / therapy plan change depending on MCTD / UCTD or SLE. Asking cause as far as what I understand the drugs involved are all the same. But I guess the severity of the deaseas and what organs it affects makes the difference. So more tests / scans / monitoring it is MCTD or SLE ? So many rheumatic diseases have the same features. Until the doc can pin down a certain number of criteria to fit a disease, you will be classified as undifferentiated. I have systemic lupus and many, many of aspects of connective tissue illnesses I think it depends on symptoms and progression,  but plaquenil seems to be the go to drug at first diagnosis. I have the same diagnosis and am on plaquenil also. My Doctor says it could turn into Lupus, Sjogrens or rheumatoid arthritis or it could go away or it could stay UCTD forever - so we are just monitoring it. Between my diet/lifestyle changes and the plaquenil - I feel like a brand new person. It is wild. Medicine takes a while to work but it is worth it when it does. Thanks for sharing. Your story makes me hopeful. Did you have a positive ANA with RNP antibodies? Did you have a positive ANA with RNP antibodies? Positive ANA but negative for RNP antibodies right now. Good point.  \n\nMy lung function was checked a few years back and was actually really good, probably thanks to competitive cycling in college.  Since having it checked, I moved from the miserable upper midwest out to the Rockies.  All the sunshine has made a huge improvement in my overall well being, and I regularly hike, bike, or ski at high altitude with no problem.  I think outdoor exercise does wonders for health. I have had stable MCTD for 5 years now. Yes, I had to check my notes, I literally had this on a post-it versus in my e-file because my family doc ran these. \n\n* b12+vit D deficient\n\n* anemic\n\n* NA Positive (speckled pattern)\n\n* Sm/rnp positive\n\n* Lupus negative\n\n* RNP positive\n\n* Chromatin positive That is awesome! I agree, something about nature and excerise! I just got diagnosed with UCTD about a month and a half ago, so you are not alone! I have been taking Plaquenil for a month now, and I am hoping to see some positive changes soon, but it can take a few months for it to kick in. With your high RNP, I am kind of surprised that your rheumatologist did not diagnose you with MCTD, since that is a marker for it. I tested negative for the RNP antibodies, thus my UCTD diagnosis. The difference between MCTD and UCTD is not that big anyway, and they are treated with the same medications. The good thing about UCTD, to my understanding, is that it does not often progress into a defined connective tissue disease (although it can), and that severe organ damage is rare. So it is a much better diagnosis than something like lupus. Hopefully your UCTD does not devolve into something else! Sending you spoons!! My rheumatologist thinks that having RNP is an autoimmune issue but does not think that it points to MCTD but to maybe developing a RA, Lupus, Sjogren's or Scleroderma. In my case when I think about it, I kind of agree with him. I am happy to have the plaquenil as a preventive measure. I have been going for rheumatology appt monthly so I am hopeful that we may catch some progression and get added treatment if necessary. Thank you for the well wishes! I was diagnosed with uctd. My ana is always positive along with anti ssa. Only symptom is joint pain and hives. All other tests are negative.", "Re-Poll: On a scale of 1-10, how intense are your average daily symptoms? Hello all! There was some confusion with the last poll of this nature. The majority of folks are used to the all-to-familiar pain scale - 10 being the worst, not the best as I had it. I would like to recount your vote in order to have a more accurate data set. **PLEASE NOTE: I have updated the scale options to be more in-line with the well known pain scale so please reconsider your answer**. I will not be deleting the original poll as we have collected some great info in the comments but if you would like your vote to be counted in a more accurate data set, please vote again below! Thanks everyone for understanding! *\\*Also, I am considering making this a recurring check-in poll so you may continue to see it pop up!*\n\n(", "Need an opinion because as of now I think docs are useless Rant warning:  I was diagnosed with MCTD in 2012.  When I moved to Cincinnati in 2020, the rheumy said \"labs normal- you are fine\"  He did not even bother looking at the 8 years of previous rheumy's notes.  I saw 2 more docs, who now say I have fibro (eye roll).  My last labs came back with a positive ANA and a sed rate 3x the max.  She says \"low on vitamins\"  WTF?!?  I sent her labs from the past showing a continuous high sed rate and C-reactive &amp; she sent my case to my PCP.\n\nWhat the hell is going on?  I am not asking for opioids- just Humira (and I am pretty sure the market for Humira is non-existent)   \n\nFor almost 2 years, my life has been wasted as I am exhausted &amp; have constant pain so I cannot even do hobbies much less work. Useless doc.  Hope you can find another. Unfortunately, that is rather par for the course when getting a dx and treatment plan for AI disease. \n\nKeep trying for a better rheumy. This makes me furious and grateful that I have a doc that does not depend on lab markers alone since he is been doing this for decades. My advice as someone who works with a lot of docs is avoid younger ones who only know how to make \u201cdata driven\u201d decisions or practice \u201cevidence based medicine\u201d which is a big trend right now in health care. I am sorry you are dealing with this and it is absolute bullshit. Find a doc that will listen and support you! You know your body best! Do not let anyone tell you different! Be patient while looking for doc, but find the right one and do not settle!! I am so sorry you are experiencing this.\n\n If you have been on medication to help manage your mctd then it might be worth mentioning that, it is possible medications that work have helped your bloodwork even out? I mean that is the point of these drugs. \n\nUnfortunately I think you are going to have to keep advocating for yourself and get a doctor that will review your medical history properly. \n\nThe first rheumatologist I saw did not give me the time of day either. Just told me \"fibro\" and sent me on my way. But I knew it was more than just fibro. \n\nI had mctd symptoms before my blood work ever seemed to confirm it too. Or they did not think it was \"enough\" to be experiencing the pain and complete destruction of my life. \n\nAll I know for sure is that doctors LOVE to gaslight their patients. I think there is value to evidence-based medicine in general (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), but for folks with really rare diseases like us, there is not much evidence to go on so listening to the patient matters a lot. tldr: My (now former) rheumy did not listen to me at all  \nWhen I first found out I had elevated RNP I was sent to a rheumy who had mixed reviews.  She walked in and did more talking than listening. She saw the elevated lab, some swelling on my ankles and threw prescriptions at me. She did not listen to me or my concerns. I had other factors going into that could have cause all of that.  Later I messaged her about the fact my lab numbers returned to normal (on a followup draw), and asked her about supplements (turmeric,ginger) or anti-inflammatory foods that may help.  Her snarky answer was bascially ordering me to take what she prescribed.", "Sick Every Morning I am going through some kind of flare or something right now in which I wake up every morning feeling absolutely miserable. It takes about three hours for me to shake it off and get going. I had an infection in May and the rheumatologist says that he thinks I have some kind of post infection syndrome and he prescribed me prednisone and voltaren, but I feel no improvement yet. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? I am taking my plaquenill and etc, but this the worst I have felt in as long as I can remember. Flares are the worst. I have only been on prednisone once, but it definitely helped. Keep doing what you can and be gentle with yourself, know your limits. Try to do something you enjoy, whether it is coloring or watching TV, just something to boost your mood a little. I am extra stiff in the morning, but nothing like a daily flare.\n\nWhat I can say is that plaquenil did nothing for me (tried for over a year) and prednisone was my only solace. However, methotrexate put me into flare remission once I tried that. Everyone is different, but consider mentioning it to your rheumatologist. If you have been on plaquenil for less than 6 months though, you will probably have to gut it out and see if plaquenil works. He has way more information to work with than anyone on the internet. Good luck. I have been on the plaquenill for three years. It definitely improved my symptoms initially. I am just going through whatever this is right now and it is been since the beginning of June. It is awful. Hmm. Yeah I dunno. I got pneumonia once (before mtx) and this resulted in a huge pericarditis and plueritis response flare. Worst I ever had. I was really messed up for 6 months. I still have permanent scare tissue around my heart that gives me pain to this day when breathing. Suffice to say, it was bad, but I recovered. I honestly feel that when I got sick, my immune system would go into overdrive, then I would flare afterwards. Again, I am (fingers crossed) in flare remission now, but maybe that is what you are dealing with? Prednisone, diet, sleep, exercise, and hope is what got me through it. I went through something similar about 8 months ago where I randomly got severe chest pain and struggled to breathe or even lie down, that on top of the stiffness was a nightmare. Nothing really helped except the steroids and when my rheumatologist suggested I take the painkiller Vimovo (Naproxen and Esomeprazole). The Vimovo allowed me to get back to normal and I was able to sleep again which was amazing. If you are going through a bad flare just make sure you do not push yourself too hard and do whatever you can to get enough sleep.", "Does anyone know what these lab results might mean? Hello! Just wondering if anyone's had similar labs. My next Rheum appt is not til late October and it is driving me crazy LOL.\nBackground....had various little issues with a toe, foot Dr sent me for an MRI of the tie. MRI report said possibly early Psoriatic Arthritis so foot Dr sent me to a Rheum.\nYou can see on my labs and looking at some of my joints that something is going on. My Rheum said that until she has all the labs back she is calling it Spondyloarthropathy. I also saw inflammatory arthropathy on my chart. \nThe first labs showed high SSA and high RNP. Then she ordered another round of bloodwork 2 weeks after the first round and the test was called something a little different and the way the numbers/levels are reported are very different. \nI keep seeing the RNPs are MCTD but I was wondering if it could be Psoriatic Arthritis. I want answers but they will not go over lab results by phone lol. \nI was also wondering about Sjornes since ibid such a high SSA the first time but them on the second round of labs it looks low but like I said, it is a different type of test and the numbers are reported so differently. \nI also have a Positive HLA B27 and Negative ANA.\nI will try to post my labs here. The dates are on them. Well, I cannot figure out how to post screenshots of my labs lol. \nFirst round was ANA Elisa 11(?)\nRNP/SM 253, SSA 380, CRP 27, Sed Rate 9, Vit D 30,\nCBC normal,  tsh 1.09, negative for any hepatitis or TB.\nThere was 3 RFs on the Rheumatoid Factor test. Two were low...a 1 and a 4. The other was RF Igg and it was 17 and the top of the normal range for that one was 20.\n\nSecond Round was called an ANA Comprehensive Plus Profile. It broke stuff down more(?) \nCRP 7, Sed Rate 29\nRNP 0.7 - normal range was o-0.9\nSSA and I think everything else was &lt;0.2. Yeah a RNP level that low is within normal limits (I believe). Mine is currently at 5.2\n\nAlso I am a bit confused - your doctor first sent you for draw for RNP without a positive ANA? How is that possible? Perhaps I misread.\n\nHere is a (maybe) relevant article from the Mayo Clinic about RNP &amp; MCTD diagnostic criteria.  Hi, thanks for answering. I will definitely read that.\nYes, she ordered a TON of labs on my first appt.\n I think they took about 7 tubes of blood LOL\nSo, the first set of labs included the ANA and she ordered it to do everything whether or not my ANA was positive. As soon as she looked at my toe and one of my fingers she knew something was going on. I have had swollen and painful since right before Covid hit our area so it is been going on a while and looks pretty bad.\nMy first RNP on the \"ANA Elisa 11\" was 253 and the normal range is listed as 0-83. That one is  an RNP/SM. \nThen 2 weeks later she ordered a different set of labs called \"ANA Comprehensive Plus\" It broke them down into separate readings for RNP and SM and several orher things. On that one the normal level for RNA is 0-0.9 and my RNA was 0.7. Everything else was low, even the SSA which was 0.2 the second time with a normal range of 0-0.2 which confused me bcuz  my SSA on my first set of labs was 384 and the normal range says 0-91.  \nMy Rheum started me on Meloxicam after seeing the high inflammation my first lab results. I think she mightve anyway after seeing my toe and the pain in my right hand and left elbow though. I kind of jumped out of my chair when she pressed on them lol.\nShe went ahead and explained that she wants me ti start on Taltz and to continue Meloxicam(Mobic) while waiting on insurance approval. I was HLA B27 Positive so I think she is thinking I am early into something and just trying to figure out exactly what. The lab results dont tell the whole story. First off we do not know what that labs numbers actually mean without seeing their range. Secondly, it is never only about just the labs. :) \nOne thing I wanted to mention I noticed is you have a normal looking vitamin D - assuming the range is like my usual test. And the majority of people with mctd have low vitamin D. Sorry about that. I did not realize I cut off the reference ranges. I would try adding pics again but I cannot figure out how to without starting a new post. \nI have low Vitamin D. \nThe reference range started at 32 and goes up to the three hundreds.\nMine was 30.7 at the time these were done. I know that is not too bad but i's been lower at times over the years. \nI always wondered why. I was surprised the first time I found out it was low a few years ago. I made a point to put more in my diet plus take Vit D daily after that but here I am still not even hitting the lowest number in the range.\nI see now, I thought I would attached screenshots of my labs but apparently not lol. Ok that makes more sense then! :) \nYour rheumy may put you on prescription vit d. They are usually once a week for 6-8 weeks and something like 50,000iu or 100,000iu. It is a super blast of vit d and gets your numbers up quick. Most mctd meds say not to go in the sun, and many people are reactive to it anyway (lupus rashes etc occur)\n\nSo only option are the heavy vit d pills. Then after that youll be tested again and probably put on maintenance levels, like 2000-5000iu a day.\n\nVit d is super important to our bodies.\n\nAnyway see if youre able to post the ranges.. should be an option when posting for image Thanks, I am trying lol. I will do a new post if I cannot figure it out. She told me to take 2000 units daily. Though, I agree with you and I think that the higher doses would help me get to feeling better quicker. \nI do not have any problems going in the sun so far. She did not mention the meds causing sun sensitivity. I work outdoors so I will have to check on that. Depends on what meds you are taking. \n\nArthritis.org says \u201cArthritis medications that can cause photosensitivity include prescription disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate (Trexall), azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), leflunomide (Arava), and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), as well as the over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen (Aleve). (Tetracycline, a common antibiotic, also causes sun-sensitivity.) \n\nPrecautions are even more important if you have lupus, which can cause photosensitivity. On the flip side, people with psoriatic arthritis may find limited UV exposure improves psoriasis, but caution is still needed to avoid sunburn.  \u201c\n\nSkincancer.org says \u201cHydroxychloroquine, for example, is one medication that can cause significant sun sensitivity in the eyes. This drug is used primarily to prevent or treat malaria but has also gained traction as a treatment for unresponsive cases of certain autoimmune diseases.\u201d\n\n\nI personally get a malar rash flare across my face and my eyes are SUPER SUPER sensitive to sunlight and I get massive headaches after driving on sunny days and I do not go outside without prescription sunglasses.\n\nEdit: forgot to say I take hydroxychloroquine My eyes are sensitive too and I get the headaches as well. I do not tolerate heat well. My ANA was only 1 and I asked and she said it is not Lupus. Though, it does run in my family. The last time I saw her I only had the first set of results back. At that time she said she is ordering more bloodwork and that she was considering Sjornes plus a Spondyloarthritos based on my swollen finger and toe and a few other areas of pain. She just said there is 5 diff to kinds of those types of arthritis and the next round of blood work would sort it out more. Yea that initial bloodwork is to see what is going on and establish a baseline. They usually like to test every 3 months or so to keep an eye on what is going on since your body can turn against itself pretty quickly. You might not realize that you have kidney failure until it is already occurring unless you have regular testing etc.\nDid she put you on anything for the pain ? Ugh lol....I was hoping to be done with the bloodwork for a while. She is already got about 12 tubes outta me lol. \nYes, she gave me Mobic to take until my insurance approval cor Taltz goes through. The Taltz has me worried too with the pain at injection site, side effects etc... I am struggling with my weight more than ever and my legs are swelling for unknown reasons so if it causes either one of those to get worse I am done with it lol. The bloodwork gets easier over time once they narrow down a diagnosis they know specifically what to test. It was likw that for me in the beginning too! Now it is just 1-2 vials every 3 months plus peeing in a cup to test my kidneys.\n\nIf you have edema you should tell your dr. It can be a sign of kidneys struggling, something is out of whack. Drink some extra water and prop your feet up, it can help. You might need a dieuretic like lasix to get it down but she should be informed for sure I told her but she saud it has nothing to do with the auto immune stuff. I went a few times to a clinic where they wrap your legs with foam and bandages and it went down almost immediately. My legs shrunk so much that the bandages were falling off but I do not have the time or energy to get there 3 times a week so now they are swollen again. Mostly my right leg. \nI tried switching from the app to the website but I still cannot find an option to add pics of my labs so I just made a new thread. I will see if I can find it :)", "Discussion Topic: How much has your life changed since having MCTD? Are you living life similar to how you were? Did you have to change your career?

Feel free to contribute as little or as much as you would like. *Please remember to be supportive of other folk\u2019s shares.* I was planning on an active career and being able to do so much before I was diagnosed. Once I was diagnosed my rheumatologist told me that I likely would not be able to work full time due to stamina issues and needing to avoid stress.\n\nSo I gave up on my career that had not even started yet and decided I would stay at home and be a mom (lol like that is not stressful....) but it allows one of us to be with our kid at all times so we can avoid daycares during COVID, which is nice.\n\nI hope I can get a combo of medications that replenishes my stamina so I can get into work but I do not see it happening anytime soon. My labs are \u201cgood\u201d and my pain is minimal so they are hesitant to switch things up.\n\nIf you were to ask me before I was diagnosed if my life plan was to be a stay at home parent, I would have said \u201cNo\u201d without another thought. But it is my life now. I am glad I can be here with my baby. Wow! Thank you so much for sharing. That is an amazingly inspiring story. It might not feel all that glamorous to you but I feel like you took what life dealt you and made something beautiful out of it! Thank you :) it does not feel very glamorous at times but I am trying to make the most out of the current situation. I realize I am lucky to be able to be comfortable and stay home, so I do my best! I got diagnosed two years ago. It has been a bumpy road but I managed to keep working full time. It was tough. I needed to stop going to the gym for a year and a half I also did not go snowboarding or rock climbing during that time too, which never happened for a single season in my life before. I probably will not be able to do that again either. It was very depressing. But I decided to adjust, and it turns out it is just what I needed to do: I am going hiking instead of climbing, nordic skiing instead of snowboarding and I am taking yoga classes instead of weight lifting. Also i started working from home at least two days a week.\n\nMy point is: No, life will not be the same as before with MCTD. But it can be just as active, healthy and productive. The important thing is to accept that in order to achieve this, things need to change and be different. Once one jumps over that hurdle in the head, it gets a lot easier. I was diagnosed about a year ago, and then also diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease shortly after. Both have changed my life pretty significantly but I try my best not to allow that to impact my attitude. \n\nI have tried a few different combinations of medications and am about to start a new one by infusion this week. I have a feeding tube and lost about 40lbs in the last year between both diseases. The joint pain is my biggest complaint day to day, but my boyfriend keeps me active, and we go for walks daily and kayak on the weekends. I had to switch careers and work part time now, but I also recently got a service dog who I am madly in love with, he is changed everything. \n\nLife has changed a lot, but I never want my attitude to change. I can always adapt, and learn to live with the challenges. I had some sort of career path but did not have health insurance or paid time off as a consultant . Gaps in treatment plus stress was terrible for my health . \n\nMy current job is easy going and has a good environment , which gives me time to focus on myself. It might not pay as well or have any upward mobility but it is the right choice at this time .", "OFF TOPIC: What is your hobby? How do you like to spend your free time (when you have energy)? It is great to have a supportive community that can relate to your illness struggles but it is even better if you can also relate to them on another level! Let us find out a little something about our fellow \"mixies\"... I am an active artist. Drawing and painting are my 'go-to's' but since my hands are not able to hold pencils, ink and paintbrushes atm I have adapted to other forms of art. Digital collage and illustration. I have been attempting to plant things and not kill them as well. :) I love this! I too am an artist and recently have struggled a with arthritis in my hands making it difficult but its so inspiring to hear how people adapt. Plants have also given me something to care for that is not so demanding. They are sturdy enough that if i need to neglect them for a day because i have no energy, then its okay. Thanks for sharing! I have so many things that I love! I am an artist and work with all mediums: painting, pouring, charcoal, jewelry making, poetry, and writing. I also am extremely passionate about psychology. I used to dislike my \"jack-of-all-trades\" tendency because it meant that i was never exceptionally good at anything but now i am realizing just how wonderful it is to be so diverse! When my hands are too sore to do intricate drawings or bead work, I can do simple acrylic pouring or research/read up on psychology events. It has helped me a lot to have so many different interests and has kept me hopeful that my future will be bright. 3D printing. I let the printer do most of the work, then wait for a good day to do the snipping and sanding. I am in a terribly long process of getting diagnosed, and the only things keeping me going are my hobbies. Although sometimes my wrists and arms are too sore, knitting and crocheting are huge stress relievers. I draw and paint, slowly. I am also very into gardening. I think these things where there is slow, long-term progress really appeal to me. The plants, like someone else said, can be left (depending what stage they are in) for one or two days at a time, and are not worse for the wear. I have found I have to rest a whole lot, recently, but I grow my own tomatoes, okra, peppers, herbs and flowers without too much stress. It is more of a microfarm than a garden\u2014we also have chickens, and have not had to buy eggs from the store in over a year. On very painful or symptom-filled days (like today, tbh), throwing half a chilled cantaloupe to ten chickens just really makes me keep going. Putting together rare lego sets, 3D printing, and restoring pinball and arcade machines.  Depending on how bad things are, I move from one to another. Its hard because some of it is very precise work. Tennis, reading and Hulu-ing. Those last 2 are not fun with MCTD but I get up a lot \ud83d\ude02 Pilates! Quilting, gardening, embroidery, reading but my hands have not been letting me do much lately. Board games and Pen and Paper RPGs (mostly Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition).\nI also picked up walking/swimming with podcasts.\n\nI am so in awe that you are all so artistic! I like to draw but am way too impatient for bigger projects...\n\nBefore I moved to a big city and before MCTD onset, I was more into club activities like drama clubs, a student bar and party venue, choires etc.\nI want to return to the active club life once I get back to South Germany, but I know I will not be able to carry heavy stuff and I might have to take more breaks... Maybe not even run the bar for a whole evening. Still looking forward to it :) I am really into embroidery right now since I have had a good break from symptoms. But normally I love to decorate my apartment and help friends decorate as well it is not hard on the body and it is so rewarding Same here! I love interior design. Only as a side hobby though That is sound cool ^^", "Spinal lesions? 2-3 yr ago, I had ridiculous joint pain and felt winded. Blood screen from GP suggested MCTD. It took weeeeeeeks to see rheumy, by which time I was asymptomatic and bloodwork was largely clear. He told me no way its lupus or MTCD, as the bloodwork would not clear up like that.\n\nFast forward to this summer, and I have got numbness in my hand and arm. L'hermitte's sign as well. MRI shows a spinal lesion, which neurologist says is Transverse Myelitis, and future lesions would likely return diagnosis of MS.\n\nSo, I have symptoms of these two diseases and no diagnosis. \n\n10yr ago, I had similar undiagnosed numbness and tingling.\n\nJust curious if anybody here had a similar story or any insights. Thanks. I strongly suggest you join the MCTD and AI facebook groups.  This subreddit is a ghost town and there are tons of people posting and answering questions on Facebook.  Not likely to get much in the way of answers here. I believe it is a ghost town because MCTD is a lot more rare than lupus or even more rare than sclerosis(scleroderma) affecting only 2 in 100,000 people on average.\n\nThis is a tiny subreddit because it affects a tiny population. Which on one side of the coin, is probably a good thing! :) Anyone will tell you the issue with diagnosing autoimmune diseases is that they all have overlapping symptoms and you can not base a diagnosis on symptom alone. It is a multipart process that can take time and many blood tests over a large period of time. Sometimes bloodwork will point to something specific right away and your doctor can determine what it is. For many of us it takes a long time. It took 6 years for my diagnosis and it was bounced around between lyme, lupus, and sclerosis, before my doctor finally decided it was MCTD due to my test results. The GOOD thing is that any rheumy will likely put you on antimalarials right away because they are almost always used across the board to treat most of the disorders. Most common and least side effect being plaquenil. The downside is that this medication takes 3-7 months to take full effect and it does not work for everyone, but it is the starting point. Yes however the MCTD facebook groups have hundreds, possibly thousands of people in them.  I have learned more about MCTD from those groups than any other source, including my doctors.  MCTD is rare, but this reddit sub is a desert compared to the FB groups. That is a shame, I greatly dislike facebook. I also would rather listen to my doctor or places like the mayo clinic rather than random internet people giving their anecdotal advice that is so common these days \ud83d\ude41 Everyone is an \u201cexpert\u201d \ud83d\ude02 Yeah...I am not saying to ignore your doctors.  I am saying I am learning from people who have MCTD and have been living with it for decades.  If you do not see any value in speaking with people who are more experienced then by all means do not.  I did not want to join facebook groups either as I also detest Facebook, but someone told me the MCTD groups are active there so I joined.  It was a great decision for me.

Probably more than a couple of months. I have brushed it off as just a callous, but it is recently gotten worse. It started of with no pain, then it started hurting when touching things, and now although my reynauds seems to be better over all this middle finger tends to be purple often and for an extended period of time. On top of that, now it hurts all the time. The pain feels very sharp, almost like a bruised paper cut. It is also moving under my fingernail. It feels like something got jammed under my nail with a throbbing feeling. I have had this before, many times. I usually take anti-inflammatories and put hot compresses on it until it goes away. Not trying to give medical advice, but that is what I do. Amlodopine helps a lot for Raynaud's.  I am fairly certain taken CoQ10 supplements helps, too, for me at least. Thank you. I cannot take anti inflammatories, sadly. I am on amlodaprine. I will look into those supplements, thank you. CoQ10 _seems_ to help my muscle pain, too. please also talk to your doctor about that.\n\nAt least, in Germany, there is stronger medicine for Raynaud's if you actually have open ulcers on your fingers.

Seems to be it is not worth the risk.", "Dry Mouth/Dry Eyes Does anyone here suffer with extreme dryness in mucous membranes (nose/mouth/eyes) and skin? I know that people with lupus often have sjogren's too, which causes this, but I am wondering if a lot of folks here with MCTD also have these symptoms.  I am not sure it is worth getting tested, which can involve a lip biopsy, but it might be nice to know if this is just part of the MCTD or something else. I do not think it is from my medications, because it has been going on before I was getting treated.", "Neurological Issues- Thalamic Lesions? Hi everyone!\n\nI literally just got diagnosed and it is definitely a strange feeling. It feels good that I finally know what is wrong and that it can be treated but on the other hand, it is also scary. \n\nMy main question to everyone is does anyone have neurological issues with MCTD? \n\nI was found to have Thalamic lesions on an MRI and my neurologist says he believes they are caused from whatever autoimmune disease I have (was not diagnosed at this point). I also have peripheral neuropathy. \n\nIf so, what have you been diagnosed with along with MCTD and what are your symptoms and prognosis?\n\nThank you very much! My only neurological symptoms are vertigo and brain fog, so I think I am pretty lucky. I was just diagnosed with chronic migraines, silent migraines with auras. This includes nausea, blurry vision, seeing circles, speech lapses, ear pain, dizziness, loss of coordination and weakness.  Also, most of the time the auras are way worse than the headache. \n\nThis all just started happening 3 weeks ago. I went into the ED with a fever of 104 and these neuro symptoms and no infection or other reason for this so it was declared a bad mctd flare but every since that day three weeks ago I experience this migraines. It is not covid either..... Now I am curious? Did you or anyone experienced random fevers with neuro symptoms or flares? \n\nThey also saw some fluid/blood in between my scalp and skull\u2014-after and Mri and they could not find a cause so of course\u2014\u2014- they blamed it on mctd and the swelling should just go down on its own.", "Tips, Pointers, Therapies, Supplements, Diets, etc that help with MCTD? Hi everyone, recently diagnosed with this, symptoms are pretty bad. Can anyone recommend diets (intermittent fasting, low carbs, no sugar etc) foods, supplements (magnesium, vitamin c) therapies (acupuncture, cyro therapy, etc) that keep their flare down?\n \nThanks! The best diet for MCTD (or any AI disease) is the one your medical team agrees is best for you (likely with a bit of food allergy testing), that works for you and that YOU can stay on. Same with supplements (they will do lab tests to find deficiencies), therapies, etc. \n\nFlares mitigation is generally done with medications like DMARDs, etc. and working to stay out of the sun, get plenty of rest, avoid stress, drink lots of water, etc. To second this, ALLERGY AND INTOLERANCE TESTING IS SO IMPORTANT!!!! I found out that some goods i are regularly were contributing to my symptoms because I have an intolerance to them and without those foods I have felt TONS better! \n\nI was diagnosed with MCTD in February of 2016 and I only just knew to do intolerance testing and it came back for egg whites which explains SO. MUCH. Also yes ask your dr which diet is best for you, they will know and will have handouts for you Discuss the Autoimmune Protocol Diet with your doctor. It is hard-I have never gone full AIP but it does help. Night shades really affect me. Hi there! My husband has mctd and is not currently on any medications, but takes quite a few supplements to help combat inflammation and pain. They are:\nFish oil (high dose), multivitamin, vitamin d, vitamin c, NAC, boswellia serrata, b complex, glucosamine-chondroitin-msm, probiotic, alpha lipoic acid, ubiquinone, and magnesium. Thanks for the feedback! I am a nutritionist.. low sugar, lowers inflammation. No gluten will lower inflammation as well.. and increase omega 3 fatty acids through a good supplement or natural foods (more difficult), but will also lower inflammation. Be careful with brand and type of supplements. If on shelf, will lose potency.. also be careful of additives, and preservatives. You can Pm Me if you would like and I can give you further advice..", "How does MCTD affect you? Hi everyone! First of all, I am very happy that this sub exists! I have never met someone that also has MCTD, and even though I have been a lurker for a while, the fact that I know that other people have it gives me a little bit of hope. Also, I am a medical student, and all of my sources say very different things about this disease, so I would like to know from other people who have it. \n\nSo, after a myriad of symptoms, I was diagnosed almost a year ago. I have experienced arthritis, esophageal symptoms, dermatological symptoms and extreme fatigue. Fortunately, my symptoms seem to have a relapse-remission pattern for now (except for the arthritis that seems to be more persistent), but when I get them, oh boy. Still, my inflammation markers and anti-RNP1 levels are high at baseline, and rise even more when I am experiencing these. \n\nI would like to know if someone has a similar experience to mine, or if you experience totally different symptoms. Also, stay safe during this weird time and hope you are feeling fine! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nPS: English is not my first language, so excuse me if some lines read a little weird! Hi! I got sick at 13, just extreme fatigue, blue fingers and toes and joint pain. My first diagnosis was Scleroderma, which later changed to SLE at 17 when I had a terrible flare up that had me in the hospital for 10 days. After that I officially had the diagnosis of MCTD. I have arthritis, my oesophagus does not quite function the way it should (which means eating can hurt because my food gets stuck...). I do not take any medication except painkillers, but I have not had any massive flare ups in a while now. \n\nAll in all, I find it quite manageable to live with at the moment. I realize I am lucky in that aspect, and things might change over time, but for now, it is just a matter of not going over my limits.   \n\n\nFeel free to shoot me a message if you want, this sub is not as active as I wish it was. Hi. I was dx\u2019d at 49 after 10 years\u2019 of progressive loss of function. This subreddit is not as active as some of the Facebook groups. Good luck! Hey...got sick about 7 years ago in my 30s. Huge family history with autoimmune diseases. Brother and mom have it too. All presented differently. I had a real bad flare that put me in the hospital for a week. Felt like death, could not move, rashes, lungs filled with fluid, kidneys affected. Got under control with plaquenil, steroids. No just use plaquenil. It is basically in remission I guess. I have experienced quite the same symptoms. First, the raynaud showed which got me quite scared. Over the course of about the following 6 months joint pains and morning stiffness started to develop up to a point where i could not really live my everyday life. With it came a quite bad fatigue. Additionally I developed diffuse pains in my throat which complicated swallowing. Basically the connective tissue in a lot of places started to become inflamed (weirdly for example pm my skull). Luckily i live close to a specialized university hospital clinic where i got diagnosed fairly quickly and put on steroids and MTX, which I did not tolerate well at all. So Leflunomide followed, which did not do enough. Now it is Baricitinib which helps tremendously. The joint symptoms and diffuse inflammations are now in remission. Raynaud stays and frankly speaking is a real bitch - It gets better with Ilomedine iv.s 3-4 times a year, but u guess I will have to sustain that for the rest of my life. Occupational and physical therapy continuously.", "What is the point of testing RNP if a positive result and a lab value of 4 which is considered a high titer means nothing to my rheumatologist ? Positive ANA and isolated high titer RNP. Symptoms out the wazoo. Lots of neuropathic pain, swelling in hands, feet, and dysautonomia. I even have pain where I have no joints which is confusing. Bilateral carpal tunnel. Am I missing something here? I am in a similar situation. Loads of symptoms, bloodwork shows positive ANA among other things, but because the rheumatoid factor came back negative my rheumatologist was like \"Well loads of people have positive ANA without an autoimmune condition so it does not mean anything\" - like... okay? But should not that be confirmation of something when all my other symptoms are considered?\n\nI do not get it either. Obviously you and I are not doctors but it is still so confusing to know there is something wrong with you and then have a doc look at one of the factors that is used to diagnose you and just go \"Eh, it does not actually mean anything\" without further explanation. I hope you get your answers soon, might have to find another rheumatologist in order for that to happen though unfortunately. Same here. Consistently positive ANA and anti-smith/RNP. Tons of symptoms. Doctor always dismissive. I mean i get that my organs are not failing and I am not entirely bed bound like I am sure a lot of their patients but dag. I am trying to get in with someone else for second opinion. Get a second opinion. Your doctor should not be dismissive of you or your symptoms. I went through 4 doctors in 5 years before I was given a diagnosis. Good luck! The positive ANA is mostly just confirmation that there is inflammation in your system. The actual number does not particularly matter that much. It really comes down to symptoms PLUS the positive ANA PLUS positive other tests for them to really nail down any sort of .. well, anything. And even then, all they can really do is try various medications on you to see what works, and unfortunately they all take many months to really work. There is not a whole lot they can really do except symptom management and medication to try to reduce the inflammation and suppress the immune system. They are dismissive because symptoms mean different things to different people and really just a barrage of testing is all that will truly tell them what is going on inside of you. In the same boat 5.9. 1:640 ANA and anti RNP 6.1AI. Rheum says no to autoimmune because I do not have Reynaud's in my hands or rashes and red swelling joints (although I do have swollen fingers). I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and ME/CFS based on my other symptoms.\n\nI personally wonder if I am in the very early stages of an autoimmune disease and symptoms may show up in a few months/years. Until I get the symptoms the rheum \"likes\" then I am just flying with these other diagnoses.", "Permanent lip procedure Im 22 F , i have mctd with Scleroderma (diffuse systemic i think) rheumatoid arthritis Sjogrens myositis and all that good stuff. Im looking for anybody with similar diagnoses that has any experience treating thin lips from scleroderma and like illnesses ... also called like \u201cdisappearing lips\u201d. If you have any info about correcting the lips with fillers cosmetic or plastic surgery pleaseee comment how that went for you. Permanent or temporary? Im getting my lips done so any success stories would be amazing thx . I have MCTD and I noticed my lips getting thinner and thinner. I figured it was connected to my disease but no one ever mentioned it as a \"thing\", so it is nice to see I am not alone! I have tried botox to soften my lip lines and \"lift\" the lips, and that worked a little bit. Recently I tried filler and it doesnt make your lips look exactly like they used to, but it definitely helped a lot. I felt I looked more like myself and was less self conscious about my mouth. It is not a permanent solution though, it is only supposed last a few months. Also! You might develop bumps under your lips from the filler (which can then be dissolved by the clinic). It has to do with our immune system reacting strangely to the filler. I developed slight bumps (only noticeable to me) after 2 months but they faded away after a week. Thx for replying. I have heard a lot of different reviews with fillers but mostly just that it is expensive to keep up because it is temporary. Im trying to do something permanent like a lip repositioning surgery because its like the fullness of my lips have turned interior. So they appear very thin and i want to see if a doctor can correct this for me and if i felt like it was not enough maybe fillers or fat transfer. It is unfortunate we have to deal with these type of problems.", "What would you like to get out of this community? What type of support are you looking for from this sub? (ie. Q/A, relatable stories, book and article suggestions, discussion topics, polls to understand commonalities, treatment options, etc.) I would like a roadmap to help people to get properly diagnosed . Being that there is activity in this sub I would like to compile a list of blood tests and their corresponding codes with major providers ( LabCorp , Quest, etc ) . \n\nRheumatologists vary widely . Some consider MCTD a precursor to another autoimmune disease . Some will re-classify you as the disease you have the most antibodies for in your overlap . Some only consider the presence of anti-RNP antibodies to be MCTD . \n\nWhen dealing with this it is extremely important to be your own advocate . Demand the testing , switching drugs ,the bloodwork . Compile and keep track of your own health data . The truth about MCTD is , it is rare , there is no cure , and it can come back even after remission . This is probably doable as we get more people active on this sub. I was just reading an article that discusses the need for a standard of care for MCTD patients and clinicians. Unfortunately it did not answer any of the questions I had but called to action the need for guidelines around diagnosis, treatment, and care.\n\nI also noticed that doctors tend to be hesitant in giving out a diagnosis since there is so much uncertainty. I have had to demand testing many times and even when results came back abnormal I have had to demand that the doctors consider them significant results (a lot of the time they shrug them off as inconclusive even though I feel that they are most definitely indicative). I have even turned to tracking my flare ups and stress to see if I can draw any conclusions. Personally, I am a bit selfish - I find that supporting others helps me. I have several friends with an array of autoimmune illnesses and we tend to gain a lot from talking to each other, sharing clean eating recipes, drug interactions, how it effects our relationships, and more. Ultimately, it can be difficult for those in our lives to understand exactly what it feels like to be in a flare and sometimes having others to talk to about it can make it much less lonely. I also think this could be a really great place for folks supporting their loved ones with MCTD. Loved ones need a place where they can get advice too!\n\nOn a separate note, I am a bit of a health and wellness research nerd. Gathering data points is a hobby of mine. We have a lot of \"rare\" people on this sub, let us make it count! I have been enjoying the daily polls. I think polls, discussion topics, news on medical breakthroughs, or even stories would be welcome. A weekly check-in, a daily poll/discussion, a monthly AID news thread may be fun?\n\nI also agree with a roadmap to being diagnosed. Maybe we could make a thread and have it stickied for anyone looking to be diagnosed or starting their journey with everyone commenting in a specific format. For example:\n\nBeginning Symptoms:\nBlood Tests (and results that proved diagnosis):\nMedications:\n\nJust to start?", "Tongue/throat issues Hey everyone! I am still waiting on my follow up exam with my rheumy, but our visit she did not seem to think I have MCTD. I have a 1:160 specked ANA and 3.0 RNP\n\nI had been having issues swallowing but after eating slower and fully chewing, issues are better. \n\nNow what is happening is that it feels like the back right of my mouth there is something or like top of my throat. It essentially feels like something is stuck and it will come and go and sometimes stay for days. It drives me crazy because it is annoying and I am constantly swallowing now. Has anyone experienced this?", "My first rheumatologist appointment! Yesterday was my first appointment with a rheumatologist. It went really well! She really listened to me and agreed that there is something wrong, and my tests and symptoms indicate that it might be an autoimmune issue. She said that it is most likely lupus or MCTD, which confirmed my own thinking. I got a whole lot more blood work done; she is re-testing my ANA and ELA panel, as well as looking at C3 and C4, and some other things. If my blood work comes back abnormal, she said she will prescribe Plaquenil, and whether or not that helps my symptoms will be the final diagnostic tool. Interestingly, she disagreed with the diagnosis of scleroderma that was given by the dermatologist I saw a few weeks ago. She said that the patch on my back is definitely a scar left by morphea, but she did not think the patch on my hairline was scleroderma. She did not see any other symptoms of scleroderma in her examination (skin tightening, etc), either. Overall, the appointment went really well and I am really hoping I get answers soon! Just wanted to give you guys an update. I hope you are all doing well! That is really positive! It sounds like you have a good doctor. Make sure she checked anti-RNP This is wonderful.  What state are you in? she did! she mentioned that she was concerned that my original anti-RNP test was a false positive, so she wants to make sure that I actually have those antibodies. Tennessee! I am actually about to move to Kentucky, but I am thinking I will commute to see her every few months just so I do not have to go through the trouble of finding another rheumatologist. Plaquenil is a lifesaver for those of us that it works in. It will take you many months of consistent medication taking for it to really work and you will likely need a few months of prednisone to get you to that point. My doctor said it would start working by 3-4 months but it actually took me until 7 months before I started feeling better but now I feel fantastic and it really gave me my life back to at least a bearable normal level.

Maybe more geographically location based. As in even in the United States it is very different (east coast, west coast, midwest, south) I see why you would say that and I really appreciate the feedback. I actually have asked a similar geographic question before. For this poll I was more so trying to keep cultural differences and nationality out of it, although I always welcome folks to expand in the comments :). I was trying to capture more of the broad environmental factors. Cities tend to have higher air pollution and even noise pollution (which is stress inducing even if we do not realize it). Bodies of moving water, such as the ocean, are bountiful with negative ions which reduce free radicals and revitalize cell metabolism. Small towns tend to be more spread out meaning there is much less noise pollution and more fresh air than in a city. Mountains and forests (nature in general) can also collect negative ions and have cleaner air. I thought it would be interesting to see where most folks are/were located.

I still have microspic blood in my urine frequently, inability to sleep.\n\nmy hand pain has gotten so bad that driving a car for more than 20 minutes or so is a daunting task cause holding the wheel is painful. \n\n\nmy PCP suspects Mctd due to a positive ANA and positive RNP antibody(ANA and RNP were the only antibodies I popped positive for on my antidbody test) c reactive protein and sedimentation rate were within normal ranges.\n\nI have my first rheumatologist appointment coming up and have no idea what to expect. I have a hard time differentiating what could be my stomach issues and what is unrelated. My appointment is December 13th, and my deductible is about to reset at the end of the year. Should I expect a ton of testing/imaging at this first appointment that would be better to wait until January finance wise?\n\n\nany advice would be very appreciated as I nervously prepare for this visit.", "Discussion Topic: What is your single most favorite MCTD-friendly (ie. AIP, Gluten-free, Paleo, etc.) meal or dish? Personally, I am hoping we have some foodies out there who really want to share! Okay, mine might be pretty obvious but... Salmon is my go to dish for keeping my diet, what I call, AIF (anti-inflammatory-friendly). I never was a huge fish-fan. When I was younger I had a hard time getting over the smell. Then, as an adult, I learned about the health benefits from salmon and my brain adapted to loving it. Now, I do a homemade turmeric and olive oil seasoning on my salmon and have it with a side of Greek yogurt. It is so simple to make and so surprisingly yummy. We just made these kebabs the other day and even my picky ones loved it! Serve with riced cauliflower and/or salad. Thanks for your reply!! What did you use in your kebabs? Oops the link did not post. \ud83d\ude48 I used it as shown but you could sub chicken if you are sensitive to red meat. \n\n That is fantastic thank you!! You are welcome. \u2764 I have been on AIP (basically paleo+ now with re-intros) for about two years. I have gotten used to it and really love it now. Tonight I grilled tuna with rice, cucumber and red onion salad (with vinegar, salt and pepper) grilled zucchini and baked asparagus. It sounds like a lot but it came together in about 35 minutes and my non-AIP family members loved it so that is a win. \n\nIf you have Instagram I recommend following unboundwellness, iheartumami (their beef and broccoli is perfection!), and whatgreatgrandmaate   They all have websites as well, I just like the visual aspect of their food on Instagram.

(", "Diagnosis and disability insurance Hi everyone - \n\nI have been on short term disability due my leg swelling. After rounds of testing / ruling out clot, I tested positive for ANA / RNP. This made sense bc of symptoms I was having in addition to leg swelling (major fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, joint pain, etc). Well, it took a while to get to a rheumatologist - and I still do not have diagnosis. This has led to my disability insurance being denied. I am at a loss re: what to do. I was hoping to be well when returning to work but still feel awful and am now past time for ST disability &amp; since I was not approved, cannot take long term. If you thought you had MCTD but do not get a diagnosis, where do you go next? What other conditions/doctors should you try? I think anti-RNP is pretty specific to MCTD so I would keep pushing for getting that diagnosis. It took me about 10 years from symptom onset until I got diagnosed and treated properly, but once I got in to see the right kind of doctor -- a rheumatologist -- it all happened pretty quickly. I have no answers, but please know I will look into this. Although there are many similarities between your story versus mine, I have fortunately have finally found a rheumatologist, and he is rather confident my blood work will yield results of something and my pcp has already prepared me for the possibility I do not receive an affirmative result, but he will treat me as such, if necessary. Also, I am able to go ahead and retire by the skin of my teeth.  So I will ask my dr next week. I will put his response here. Ask about dermatomyositis, scleroderma, and vascular disease. That is some of what I am being tested for. I am in almost the exact same scenario as you - years of symptoms, positive for ANA/RNP, but no official diagnosis yet.  I am self-employed but was working with my financial planner to set up disability insurance.  I told him there is some \"autoimmune stuff\" that we are trying to sort out, and he connected me directly with the underwriter who would assess an application for disability insurance.  We had a long chat and I even sent him some blood work - he said that it is almost guaranteed I would be denied because it is so hard to define what my disease can cause, therefore they cannot calculate the risk or exclude something that they deem to be too risky for them to cover.  I understand it (as I used to be in insurance myself) but it is incredibly frustrating.  We closed the conversation by agreeing to circle back when a diagnosis got resolved.  To be fair, I am not sure how this would differ if you had some about of disability insurance provided to you through a company/group benefits.\n\nSorry you are going through this, and hopefully you have some better luck than I!", "Trouble swallowing/lump in throat I am having some trouble with my throat--I guess it may be my esophagus--where I am having difficulty swallowing and constantly feel like there is a lump in my throat. I have to drink a lot of water with anything dry and avoid anything spicy or acidic, which makes it worse.  (Those also happen to be my two favorite types of foods, which is depressing!) I assumed at first this was just GERD but I am seeing some posts here about esophageal problems and just wondering how common this is? Has anyone had this issue and was it GERD or something more serious? (Sometimes I am wondering if I am just attributing a random thing going on with me to my immune system.)\n\nI am also wondering whether I should return to the rheumatologist about this or if he will think I should be seeing my PCP instead, which would mean two visits instead of one and I am so over the doctor thing. I feel like it can be really difficult to identify which symptoms are truly related to MCTD since there are so many. But this one is really impacting my life--my eating, even at times making it feel like it is hard to breathe at night. I think my upper digestive track is very irritated.  Any guidance would be appreciated, especially if you were able to manage this on your own without having to get scoped or something major like that. I have had this same issue for years but do not notice that it gets worse with any certain type of food. I actually have it so bad at time I vomit trying to swallow. Breathing is also a huge symptom related to acid reflux. If I were you I would try to get on a daily medication that calms that. Dexilant is a great one! Wish you luck. You can PM Me if you want more info. Yes, this sounds very similar to my symptoms. I was diagnosed with esophageal dysmotility, which is a known complication of MCTD. In order to diagnose it, I had an upper endoscopy with manometry and a video fluoroscopic swallow study. The manometry measures the pressure in your esophagus when it squeezes the food down - mine was really weak. The swallow study actually showed the food getting stuck in my lower esophagus - which corresponded to that feeling of needing to swallow multiple times. There is not really any treatment to correct the swallowing, unfortunately, but I take omeprazole and raised the head of my bed which helped with reflux I did not even know I had, and am more aware of the foods that give me problems. I imagine either your PCP or your rheumatologist could refer you to GI for evaluation. My rheumatologist referred me. Thank you for sharing. This process does not sound fun at all. And if the only way to treat it is with acid reflux meds and diet (which I am doing now) , do you think getting an \"official\" diagnosis was worth it? I will look into that! I have not heard of Dexilant. I am a bit of a baby but hoping to avoid having to deal with any diagnostic procedures if I can. It can be worth it.  There are further treatments for more severe cases, as well.  Years ago, this symptom was called \u201cglobus hystericus\u201d (meaning it was in your head, mainly) but rheumatologist have gotten smarter.  Yes, get the tests, they do not suck too bad, so try the treatments.\n\nOther treatments can be muscle relaxers and stretching the esophagus.  Find out now, before it gets worse.  I lost my esophageal motility and did not even know it, and I wish I had responded earlier.  \n\nAdd a gastroenterologist to your team, and get some answers. Thank you for the advice! Interestingly I was on muscle relaxers for my back for a few weeks right before this, then stopped taking them right before it started.  I wonder if I could be getting a bit of a rebound effect from that too. That sound very possible! Yes, I guess I should clarify. There are multiple problems that can happen in the esophagus. Mine is just weak and loose, so there is not much else to do right now. But some people can develop strictures, which are rings of scar tissue that cause food to get stuck. Those can be treated with dilating procedures. There are other potential issues as well, such as Barrett\u2019s esophagus from reflux. If you know what the underlying issues are you will have a better idea of what may help. This is really helpful. Thank you for such a thoughtful reply! You can request to try it. It is one of the best meds for this. Same here. It is very mild so all the diagnostics came back negative (did all the works - endoscopy, scintigraphy). It seems to be part of the deal in varying intensities. Nothing can be done in my case, but I found it comforting to know that everything else was ruled out. Thanks for letting me know! Do you watch your diet? Does that seem to help or maybe OTC acid reducers? I also have swallowing problems. I went through several tests with my gastrointerologist including a monometry test. They diagnosed me with motility issues and said that 80% of people with this disease have some sort of swallowing problem. I was also told they have not figured out the connection yet and why this is true. They said usually the problems level out and do not continue to progress. It is been 4 years it is been and my swallowing problems have not gotten worse.  I eat slow and drink a lot of liquid with my food. Take care I am so glad to hear that it is not getting worse for you. That scares me quite a bit to think that I might not be able to eat easily. I will definitely try to drink more liquid and slow down-frankly I eat way too fast. I was also using nicotine gum which I am sure did not help, since some of it drips down your throat and probably irritates it. 80% is a huge number though. I noticed that I have a lot of muscle spasms throughout my body so I initially suspected that since your GI track is basically muscle, that these muscle issues might be related. But just a theory! It seems like with MCTD the immune system is attacking a lot of soft tissue all over. G.I. issues are very common as well, although they really do not know why. If you Google mix connective tissue disease you can find some decent resources with information information. Is like the national organization rare diseases. I hope you feel better.", "MCTD Journey &amp; Plaquenil Experiences Hi everyone! Apologies in advance if this has been spoken about in a previous post. I have recently been diagnosed with MCTD two months ago, and prescribed Plaquenil and Nupentin. \n\nA close friend of mine who is a nurse explained that Plaquenil can take upto 6 months before you begin to see results, so I am trying to remain positive but finding the side effects of it dreadful. Experiencing additional things as the weeks progress \u2014 Anxiousness, quite intense lower back pain, migraines, loss of appetite, nausea, shakes, weakness and dizziness. A few of these being my original MCTD symptoms.\n\nHave read that these are side effects of Plaquenil but would love to hear your experience with it or Nupentin. Did it work for you, or if not? \u2014 and how long before you began to see results?\n\nI was also sent for a bone density scan, as I may have Osteopenia. I have not seen my Rheumatologist since it was done but from what I could gage on the results, and a significantly low T-score result \u2014 it does not look too good.\n\nMy next appointment with my Rheumatologist is not until the end of September, and it is my first follow up with her since my diagnosis \u2014 where I was really just handed a couple of pamphlets and sent on my way, so as you can imagine I have a list of questions ready but just feeling a bit lost at the moment and interested in understanding a bit more about others journey with it. Hi!   \nYour friend is absolutely right in how long it takes to fully feel the effects of Plaquenil. Most people I know actually lose most of the side-effects and have an improvement in their condition.\n\nI am a separate case however, Plaquenil did not work for me, and so far I have been unmedicated for the last couple of years (in agreement with my doctor. I have regular blood work done, appointments with my rheumy every 6 months to see if I should not start something back up, so far I am stable)\n\nI am sorry you are suffering right now, but I want you to know that the first few years of living with MCTD are the worst, and then it sort of stabilizes (for me it did, at least). \n\nMost important bit of advice I can give you; listen to your body. If it tells you to rest, rest. Even if you are in the middle of doing dishes, take a 15-30 minute break, watch an episode of something, and then you will be able to continue what you are doing without straining your body as much. Without wanting to scare you, for me it took 9 months to feel any benefit. Apparently I am in the minority, but it can take time to work. \nNow that I have been on it since 2017 and it is doing its job, I would not be without it. \n\nDo not take it on an empty stomach, even a glass of milk is better than nothing. Are you taking it once or twice a day? I had to halve my initial dose at first, wait a month or so and then add in the second half. Take it at night so you sleep through the worst of it. \nStick to a bland diet until you have built up a tolerance to it. \n\nIt is a great drug in the long term but it is not fun at first but I will not lie and say I am a fan of the retinal scans or the photosensitivity that come with it.  \n\nOnce you have made it through the first month, the side effects should not be as much of an issue. Firstly, I love your username! \n\n&gt; I want you to know that the first few years of living with MCTD are the worst, and then it sort of stabilizes (for me it did, at least). \n\nThis is true. It takes some getting used to, but you can do it. My condition worsened a bit in the last 18 months but even then, it was not as bad as the first couple of years. Eventually you know your body, your disease, your triggers and hopefully your rheumatologist and it becomes something you adapt to quickly. \n\nIt is not fun but it is definitely not as scary as it seems when it is all new. I moderate several MCTD communities on FB, fwiw. I would say the average person on HCQ from what we have seen starts seeing results within 6 weeks, with increasing efficacy as time continues. \n\nThe thing about side effects is two fold - they differ from very rare to common, and often are similar to what are experienced by those on placebo, so verify against those experienced by the control group. I experienced a bit of nausea at first, so my rheumy prescribed Zofran, but after 6 weeks that was no long an issue. That is VERY common with HCQ - many side effects fade with time. \n\nMCTD symptoms unfortunately tend to get worse without treatment, from joint to organ damage. And the component diseases often worsen to become primary and secondary, for example, I now have Primary RA and Secondary Sjogren's. So I am on additional meds like Gabapentin, Mobic and Methotrexate. Thank you for you response and sharing your knowledge. Can I ask how often you were seeing your Rheumy in the beginning?\n\nI probably sound so naive \u2014 I think what I am finding the hardest is that my last appointment was when I was given my diagnosis and I could not have been happier, to finally have some answers but then of course you learn that MCTD is in fact an umbrella and that the journey has only really just begun. What were your conversations like when you were first diagnosed, were they able to define your component diseases from the get go or is it something you discovered later on? \n\nWith how foreign this all is to me, what questions do you think are the most important questions I should be asking my Rheumatologist? Thank you for sharing your experience with it! I cannot imagine how you would have been feeling in those 9 months, was it hard to remain positive? \n\nI am taking it once a day, Plaequnil of a morning and Nupentin at night. It is interesting though that you mention you take your HCQ at night \u2014 it would definitely help the way it is making me feel if I could swap, maybe that is something I can ask my Rheumy.\n\nShe has not explained anything about retinal scans, or the photosensitivity that was just something I have read about since seeing her \u2014 will definitely have to change my mentality, having quite an olive complexion I have not really ever worried myself if I have applied sunscreen or not. Thank you for your response!\n\nCan I ask, do you know why it did not work for you? I am glad to hear you are stable. Have you experienced flare ups since being unmedicated \u2014 and if you do, how do you cope? \n\nIt is a continuous push and pull of trying to remain positive and then feeling sorry for myself. At the moment here in Australia we are in lockdown, and so I have not been working \u2014 my job is quite physical and my flare ups have been so much more consistent since not working, so as horrible as it is to say but I am almost grateful this lockdown happened when it did so my body has been able to rest but I am beginning to think not being as active is more of a hindrance than a help.\n\nAre there things you find help moderate how often you experience a flare up like exercise and diet? Unfortunately I am not on FB, but do you mind listing the groups \u2014 I might ask my partner to join so that I can access. We recently found out that I may have another auto-immune disease, so I think it may have something to do with that. I still have to go through a bunch of tests to confirm whether or not I have it (I hope it was just a fluke, and they will tell me they cannot find whatever it is they found last time). But I was getting sick all the time, someone sneezes and I end up with sinusitis and antibiotics (slight exaggeration, but I was sick all the time). \n\nThe few flare-ups that I do have, are usually triggered. My main triggers are the sun, stress and lack of sleep. I am a programming student and a mother of a three-year old, so I cannot really avoid any of those, haha. But 9/10 times it is my wrist that swells up insanely, I have a brace that I wear on those days and my doctor prescribed me Diclofenac (NSAID) and Paracetamol to take as needed. \n\nI have started doing yoga to stretch my muscles, and it helps tremendously with my back pain, one 20 minute session, and I am *almost* completely painfree for a couple of days. But I also listen to my body, if I cannot hold the pose, or if I cannot do it at all, I will wait for the next one.   \nDiet-wise I do not think I do anything special, we have mainly homecooked meals (but that is the culture in my country), I do not eat bread, my oesophagus does not function completely so I always have to drink after every bite or it feels like I am choking. I did notice I started feeling better since cutting out grease. We traded in our deepfryer for an airfryer over 2 years ago, and that helped a lot of gut-issues. \n\nI have similar feelings about the lockdown, I was able to do online classes, which also made my schedule a lot easier to work with (instead of waking my toddler up at 6, getting her to school by 7.15 and me on my train by 7.30, I got to wake her up between 7 &amp; 7.30 and make sure I was back by 8.30 to start my classes). I cannot do physical jobs, which is why I decided to go to college for a programming degree. I do not know if there is an option for you to have a job that is less physically demanding? I generally see mine every 3 months. \n\nHonestly, at first the conversations were very awkward and stilted - I did not much care for her (in all fairness, she was running an hour late due to front office issues) and we were not really communicating well. But we somehow smoothed it all out as we continued in the first year of seeing each other. She managed to figure out the primary dx (RA) and secondary (Sjogrens) and decided on a course of action (HCQ), then we added (MTX). \n\nThe main things we talked about (I am nearly 50) was our short term &amp; long term goals for treatment. I NEED to be mobile, so we are working hard on protecting my joints. I did not want a conservative treatment modality, I wanted one that was going to keep me MOVING and independent, so she agreed that was best for me at my stage of life. \n\nWhen I had problems with side effects that were making it difficult to take HCQ, she added Zofran. She also gave me meds to handle my Flares, so I can get back to my LIFE quicker without prednisone (Pilocarpine, etc). \n\nThe main issue I had was being honest about the struggles I was having and being direct. She was frustrated at my hesitance in reporting them. She is VERY no-nonsense. One we sorted that out, we now have appointments where we laugh and enjoy each other. Plaquenil has truly been a miracle for me. It took about 10 weeks for it to help with my fatigue and muscle pain. I still have a bit of a rash on my face, on my cheeks and around my eyes, but it also seems to be getting better. Whether that is me avoiding the sun or taking the meds I am not sure. I am sorry you are having so many side effects--I have heard that these do get better with time for some people. My only side effect has been stomach issues but in my case it is well worth dealing with a bit of tummy trouble to get my life back. I also take vitamin D and gabapentin for some nervous system issues I have, plus magnesium and potassium per my neurologist. I hope you can hang in there and see if it works for you. I am so thankful for this medication. Plaquenil gave me a lot of my life and sanity back, it is a miracle when it starts to kick in and one day you just realize \u201cwow hey I am doing better\u201d. It has to build up. Some people say they feel better in 4 months. For me it took 7. I took prednisone on a low dose until 8 months in. I became pregnant and had to stop the prednisone. I did go back on it shortly twice after and felt so much better on it but my dr wont let me stay on it long term. Sorry it is taken me so long to reply, I have had a few big flare ups \u2014 have not really felt myself. \n\nHow did you go with your tests to determine another autoimmune? \n\nI would love to get into yoga or Pilates again. I have not done it for years but did think it might help, so glad to hear you get some relief from it.\n\nI definitely have to think about a new career path. We are still in lockdown here in Aus, so I have not been working or moving as much as I usually would be and I am terrified to go back because my body will be a wreck! No problem, I hope you are feeling better!\n\nSo I have had night sweats for as long as I can remember (at least since my teenage years), and about 3 years ago they noticed I had enlarged lymph nodes. I have had 3 PET-scans, the \"we are 99% sure you have lymphoma\" talk twice, and 2 biopsies since then. My hematologist now believes I have what is called Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS), which means my white blood cells do not go away after they have served their use, but they like to \"retire\" in my nodes, which CAN lead to lymphoma down the line. I am still getting worked up, since it is a genetic disease, and it takes about 6 months to get results. \n\nI hope you can transition easily back into work, would starting half days work or is that not possible in Australia?", "So much anxiety, could use some help! Hi everyone, I am 27f. My whole life I have had some digestive issues ibs-d that increase when I am stressed or on my period. My dr said that since all my regular test results came back positive she could do some for for autoimmune things. My wbc, rbc, kidney function, c3, c4, and everything came back normal. All my antibodies came back as negative except for RNP which was positive at 4.7. ANA at 1:640. Does this mean I MCTD? I literally do not have any symptoms. I sometimes feel fatigued if I am stressed out and maybe take a power nap once or twice a week. I do not have any joint pain that im aware of. No low grade fevers. I really do not get sick often and when I do I recover really quickly. I had Covid and recovered within 2 days of it. Just really nervous about this. My GP said she could refer me to a rheumatologist and sometimes they just confirm that everything is fine. I guess I am nervous to go and find out I have something serious. Diagnosis cannot be made on blood tests alone my rheumatologist said. I would not worry. Ask what symptoms to watch for and follow up with any symptoms you think may be related when they are happening. Thank you \u2764\ufe0fI appreciate it I would be very surprised if you had MCTD with no symptoms. I think lots of people go through periods of lots of symptoms but inconclusive blood tests, not the other way round. \nI really hope you do not have it and I urge you not to Google your test results and let your doctors tell you what they think. Googling can lead to so much unnecessary anxiety. I did way too much googling lol that was my first problem. So I think banning myself from googling would be good and just following up with my dr if I do get symptoms. I also had an online dr tell me that sometimes there can just be rogue results that do not mean much of anything My MCTD started with IBS-D then progressed.  After some years on hydroxychloroquine (a very safe, well understood medication), I am back to just ibs-d and mild to moderate fatigue and muscle achiness.  It is a pain in the ass, but it is manageable.  I get a lot of outdoor exercise, which helps. Also, occasional weed, turmeric, mirtazapine, and not eating gluten help. Thank you for your comment! How long did you have ibs-d for previous? I have had mine for at least idk maybe 12 years now? I had IBS-D several years before the other symptoms developed so you could be on the same path.  Going gluten free helped everything, and eating fermented foods (yogurt, small amounts of kefir, small amounts of sauerkraut) helps some, too. Eat lots of leafy vegetables, either raw or cooked. I am 26F, just diagnosed today, and here to help ease your anxiety! I was also diagnosed with IBS-D in 2014 with symptoms starting over a decade ago, but then also fibromyalgia, and PCOS, and other issues. I have had unexplained pain for most of my life. My hands have been swollen and stiff for the past 5 months, which is what prompted my doctor to do blood tests and then refer me to the rheumatologist that officially diagnosed me. I have not had normal energy levels since I was in middle school. I need 8-9 hours of sleep a night to function and not be miserable, and like 3 days a week I still nap 2-3 hours in the middle of the day. I was sick back in December with what the ER said might have just been a cold (tested negative for covid twice), and I had a fever of 102.5 for a week straight, passed out once, and had a heart rate of 130. It took me two months to fully recover. \n\nI hope it ends up being nothing serious in your case!", "Do these symptoms sounds like MCTD? I was asked to get blood work done bc I have severe TMJ and my doctor was concerned about arthritis/autoimmune/connective tissue stuff. I tested positive for ANA and I know false positives are possible but I am really scared. Here are my symptoms:\nTMJ and associated symptoms (ear ringing, clicking, locking, headaches, tight neck and shoulders)\nAchey hips and ankles in the winter (sometimes it keeps me awake)\nMy knees and wrists just started to ache \nFrequent charley horses \nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon (had it since I was a kid)\nHeartburn (lol idk if that is related to anything)\n\nI think it is possible I have hEDS because I have a lot of the physical features. I am trying my best to research because I want relief and answers, but I do not know very much. My jaw pain is debilitating, it is what sent me looking for treatment/answers. The rest of the stuff is just subsidiary, and I am so freaked out right now that I do not trust my own perception of what my body is doing lol. \n\nI have been lurking on this sub and really love how supportive everyone is. I know you can live a good life with this disorder, but I am trans and a runner. I may have to go off hormones and I may have to stop doing what I love. I do not know if I could handle that. Is there anyone here who is still athletic? EDS is considered rare by doctors and hard for them to diagnose, but more common than MCTD, which is pretty rare. I have those symptoms but probably at least 20 major others. It sounds like it is more TMJ and RA. Definitely not trying to downplay your symptoms though. It does not sound like you quite fit the description. Hopefully the tests are helpful It sounds very possible to me. My fatigue is what is disabling, personally. It is what limits my activities. MCTD varies a lot in presentation though. Are you on E or T? Definitely could be connective tissue. I have UCTD and probable EDS (no one will diagnose without genetics and no one will do genetics bc I am not a kid anymore in my city?! Who knows...) anyway, it sounds a lot like me. I am on Plaquenil and that helps a lot although it gave me hair loss for awhile and my ears ring MCTD can screw with the entire GI tract, causing motility issues and heartburn, among other things.  I just make sure not to eat gluten (a trigger for me), not to eat too much at once, and to eat healthy (lots of fruits, veggies, and yogurt or other fermented foods.\n\nI bike about 50 miles per week and regularly go on 10 mile hikes in the Rockies.  You can stay active.  Just keep the activity level fairly steady. 50 miles is 80.47 km Get tested for anti-RNP.  It is THE test for MCTD. I am on T. That makes sense. I am getting bad sleep lately bc of TMJ so I have been a little tired but nothing crazy. Thank you for responding! No, thank you! That makes sense to me. Ive heard that suppression of estrogen can cause arthritis, and I am on testosterone. I hope so too. Thanks! Ok good to know. I am seeing a rheumatologist some time soon, do u think it would be good to ask about EDS? This is so good to hear. Exercise was my main concern. Thank you so much! I am vegan and a super healthy eater. I will try to cut out gluten and see if that helps. They tested for that as well and my results were &lt;0.2. Is that a good or bad sign? (I just went to student health so they did not really go over it much) Sure. Worth a shot. No problem! I am also trans. Getting some other health problems sorted before I get on T. According to everything I have read, and my rheumatologist, T can actually be a good thing because E can make our disorder worse. I do not know your situation and I am not a physician but I think your hrt situation sounds hopeful. Ok that is really good to know! Good luck getting on T :) Thanks! I have only ever had positive (as opposed to negative), but results that are reported like yours (i.e. &lt;0.2) usually indicate an undetectable amount and thus are effectively negative. Make sure you get B12.  Apparently, fermented foods have it even if they are vegan (e.g. miso, sauerkraut, kimchi, maybe wine). What about 10 miles? If that is THE test for MCTD, is it very unlikely that I have it then? (Sorry I have such little medical knowledge lol) I am not sure of the sensitivity of that test ( likelihood of a false negative) so maybe not unlikely. I think you should continue doing what you love. That is what makes you happy. Go to the right docs and find the right treatments from a doc that understands your situation. I wish you luck and wish I could help but not familiar with the symptoms and if they are related.", "Ticking a marathon off a bucket list Is anyone here a runner? I have been trying to complete a marathon for nearly 5 years now, with no luck. I either get injured or ill; either causes flair ups and months of recovery. I am starting to give up\u2026 If it is your goal, take us along!   \n\nI wanted to be a runner, but had nightmares of not having the right stride.  I did, finally, do a 5K on a treadmill in my late 60\u2019s.  I was pretty proud.\n\nLet us be your cheer squad That is so amazing!! Way to go! That gives me so much hope that my marathon is a very achievable goal :) Time to start planning! Get yourself some training, and do not forget to keep us updated.  I want to hear more! 2x marathoner here with mctd. I used an online training program over about 30 weeks to train. I was 50 when I ran the one last. It can be done but listen to your body and take it slow at first. Best to you! It all starts with a single step forward. Will do :) Did you have a good base to start from for the 30 weeks? Could pretty easily run 7 or 8 miles before the training, definitely needed the slow, progressive build up to 26 with the training plan. You can find many versions online. I think that could be a good plan - train up to those sort of distances first, and then start a marathon training plan. Thanks!! I know this post is a month old.... But yes I am.  My 2nd RNP just came back at 5.5.  My symptoms have actually decreased since I started taking an antibiotic (we thought I might have Lyme as the symptoms are similar - but now I am wondering if an infection is the cause of the AI issue).    \n\n\nI ran the OCR world championships in late September, and then started having fatigue and mild flu-like symptoms (covid negative).  I continued my training, by mid October I had night sweats, a trunk rash (itchless), and fatigue. 1st blood draw and first +RNP.   But I went and did a Spartan Beast (13mi) with no problems. The next week the CRP/Sed numbers were back to normal.  I ran a Tough Mudder in 40\\* weather, including 1 ice bath obstacle, with no problems.  I ran a 10 mile training run, and a 15 mile training run 2 weeks ago. The only soreness was the usual soreness from a 44yo running on a trail.  Then I started the doxycycline. Ran a 25k trail race 2 days ago - no problem.   \n\n\nRight now I feel fortunate and thankful I can do this stuff. My wife and I are about to go on a total plant-based diet and I am going to make some other changes so I can be as active as possible for as long as possible.", "I am in need of some guidance... Hello!\n\nI am really glad to have found this subreddit!\n\nI am not even sure where to begin... I have so many persistent symptoms I am not sure I could list them all but these are the ones that have been most bothersome lately:\n\nMy tongue is always swollen. There are times it is worse and it becomes very uncomfortable while sleeping and I will need a prednisone taper to make it go away. It is been at least a few months since my tongue has felt \u201cnormal\u201d. Even right now, I feel like it is just too big for my mouth. \n\nMy hair is just coming out all over the place. When I wash it, it is just so much that comes out, as gross as it is, I have to run my fingers through the ends to try and get the majority of it so it does not clog the shower. Then when I comb my hair, it just keeps coming out. It is also breaking off very short around my hairline. \n\nFatigue is just overwhelming. No matter how much I sleep, it is not enough. \n\nIt is been years for most of my symptoms but the tongue swelling and hair loss started after I gave birth to my first baby 9 months ago. Since I gave birth, I have felt absolutely horrible. All of my body pains are very intensified and I get the worst migraines. \n\nNeurologist ordered an ANA and it came back positive with RNP at 1.6. \nIt does not give me titter or pattern information (LapCorp... anyone know how to get this information?)\n\nI had a check in with my PCP who would not really elaborate on the blood work results because they did not order them, the neurologist did. They mentioned it could point towards MCTD. \n\nI have a follow up appointment with neurologist next month, but in the meantime, I would like to know how people were diagnosed and if my recent symptoms of tongue swelling and hair loss could be associated? Is the elevated RNP a diagnostic measure for MCTD?\n\nThank you for all of your time! Usually diagnosed by a rheumatologist but other specialists can interpret. I would guess your neuro will tell you to see a rheumatologist. hard to say. You clearly have something going on but the doctors will be the best to get real help. Typically meds are what really helps eliminate some (not all) of the fatigue and can reduce the other symptoms or prevent the flares from being so often or so long. \n\nIf you are really miserable maybe you can move your neuro followup up? or request a telehealth with them sooner? \n\nits really tough in the time before you get answers and starting treatment. especially raising kids with fatigue. I sympathize. Because you did not mention a rheumatologist - do you already have one?\n\nYou should definitely get one ASAP, they are the autoimmune specialist and will likely be the one to diagnose you.\n\nJust bc you have positive ANA and positive RNP antibodies, it does not have to be MCTD - that is where the rheumatologist checks your other symptoms and lab values.\nYou will likely also get more specialist visits for heart and/or lung checks.\n\nIf that rheum dismisses you, do not feel bad about asking about a second opinion!\n\nGood luck and congrats to your baby! I do have neurological symptoms as well but very light (my right hand and side feels number and I do not really feel pressure, just tingling) but that does not show up on MRT.\nThe same with people with Lupus I know that have one-sided or peripheral pins and needles - all invisible on MRT.\n\nSo if the neurologist does not find anything on MRT, that does not mean it is not there. It can be a symptom of an autoimmune disease, for instance.\n\nThat is why it is important you get referred to a specialist for autoimmune issues, a rheum :) Hello! Thank you so much for your reply! I do not have a rheumatologist yet. The neurologist did call me today and tell me he was referring me to rheumatology because of the blood work results. \n\nWhat is the MRT? I am unfamiliar with that abbreviation. \n\nMan... figuring out what is going on with us is more than a full time job... add in never feeling well enough to be your own advocate, a healthcare system that does not put the patient first, and then the difficult time of diagnosis!\n\nI hope you get some answers and get to feeling better soon! Hello! Thank you for your reply \ud83d\ude0a \nI just got a phone call from the neurologist today and he is referring me to rheumatology! Hopefully this could be one step closer to an answer and treatment! Yey, you got the referral ^.^ !\n\nSorry, I am from Germany, the English abbreviation is MRI - magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nI am mostly okay bc my MCTD symptoms are relatively mild and treatment with HCQ/Plaquenil, knowing that I AM sick and it is not just in my head, new routines and coping as well as support groups are a real boon.\nI can really recommend looking for a support group :) ! Especially if you have some doctor trouble (dismissive, stalling) - that can really weigh one down.\nAnd you can vent there about the time it takes to get diagnosed and then treated^^\n\nBut it looks like you have a caring PCP and I am glad for you! Hello!\nYes, I feel like maybe I am one step closer to diagnosis and treatment! It is a weird feeling... I know I actually have something wrong and hopefully can be treated!\nI have had an MRI of my brain (bad migraines and ringing in my ears so PCP ordered one). \nNeurologist found 2 lesions in my thalamus that he did not know the cause of (yet and was doing more research) and after seeing the blood work results, said whatever autoimmune disease I have, has attacked my brain!\nThat has made me not feel so good knowing it is already attacked my brain! I hope so for your sake. The rheumatologist will be able to start looking at different parts of your bloodwork but also do a physical exam looking at your joints and may order x-rays. All very helpful in getting answers. I had minor symptoms before my son, but my symptoms got worse as he weaned. I have read a lot about women auto immune issues + hormones &amp; it is not great. I recommend a good rheumatologist - do your research &amp; do not settle. It took me three to be taken seriously &amp; get some kind of answer", "MCTD since childhood?? I wrote a huge post earlier and then lost it. The gist of it is this: I am 41 and I just got a positive ANA test with positive RNP Plus high sed rate, CRP, and eta protein.\n\nNow looking at the list of symptoms I recognize signs I have had my whole life. \n\nEvery year or two it was a new round of symptoms I could not ignore (unlike the headaches, joint pain, and fatigue I just chalked up to aging and obesity.)\n\nSome doctors seemed to listen. They would order a CBC, glucose and lipid panel, maybe thyroid if I was really lucky. One even ordered cortisol and histamine because I asked.\n\n I would wait, then get a call. \"Everything is normal, but your cholesterol is a bit high. Eat healthy, exercise, and lose some weight.\" \n\nA few months later the weird symptom would go away and I am left going, \"What was that?\"\n\nThe only reason I got tested this time is because I have skin thickening on my fingers. \n\nSo has anyone else lived decades with this disease, undiagnosed? My symptoms started five years ago when I was thirty, but looking back, I think I have had some issues since childhood that I just dismissed or was told that it was growing pains. \nLike you, I would go through periods of being fine and then it would flare up again. Mostly things like random but severe muscle pain, joint problems and tendinitis. I am incredibly photosensitive now, but when I was younger, it was just dismissed as having fair skin. I had a bad illness when I was 6. They thought it was meningitis and did a spinal tap. Before that I was a very active child, but I slowed down and started havinf stomach pains brought on my stress. \n\nRaynaud's in my feet when I was a teen until my early 20s. I have had a red face since my early 20s when my acne mostly cleared up.\n\nThe stomach issues and Raynauds were replaced by migraines, aura, and vertigo in my mid 20s. Also had swollen glands at one point with a terrible salty taste. That lasted a few weeks.\n\n I was diagnosed with PCOS. My CRP was elevated but my big toe had been bothering me, so they dismissed it as a fluke and did not test further.\n\nThe back and joint pains really started after I had my first child. The pregnancy was wonderful. My skin cleared up, no pain, no itching, so much energy. I actually lost weight with both my kids. The only time I have ever lost weight. \n\nBut after he was born everything came back. I also started having weird nerve misfiring and psiatica. Tingling in my feet. I was tested and retested for diabetes, but my blood sugars are ok.\n\nMy son came out with a weird rash on his eyelids. Now I know that is connected. He is also on the spectrum. I had two miscarriages along the way, too.\n\nI was excited to be pregnant with my daughter, but the autoimmune stuff did not clear up with her. That sucked. I figured I was 35, pregnant, with an autistic preschooler. No wonder I was so exhausted.\n\nThree years ago I finally went on an antidepressant to deal with the stress. That is the other thing the doctors always say: avoid stress. Ha ha. I am a teacher. I avoid it as much as I can.\n\nI had an episode where I woke up unable to exhale. It only lasted a minute or two. The doctor said probably asthma. Now I am thinking laryngospasm. I also have pain in my back when I breath deeply.\n\nSince Covid I have been teaching remotely (I teach K-6 computers).  I put on 20 more pounds.  My hands and feet started swelling. I felt like my whole body was swollen and I was wearing an inner tube around my waist. My knees and hips were especially bothering me and I was out of breath just walking a short distance. I started exercising every day on a recumbent bike and I feel better as far as the swelling and being winded. But my joints still hurt.\n\nI decided to discuss bariatric surgery with my doctor but I wanted some tests first. Well, I got them and now here I am.\n\nAnyway, I am sure I could think of a couple more things, but I have to put my kids to bed. Same here. Possibly caused by severe bacterial infection during birth.\n\nTook many, many years and constant insistence on my part to continue to do blood work and go through labs. Finally got a diagnosis in 2019 just before covid hit. Verified by going to two different rheumatologists.\n\nI am 32 now, looking back it all makes sense. It is so frustrating for me to hear from doctors they do not know what is related to my disease and what is not.  But I deal with constant waves of unusual symptoms. My Reynauds has been around since my teens. I recall at age 12 suffering with achy painful legs this continued throughout my teen years. Then in my early 20\u2019s I had my first bout of panniculitis (erythema nodosum) and have had it 4 times as well as one bout of the erythema induratum. I have had high cholesterol since my early 20\u2019s and a ton of new symptoms until getting a diagnosis last year at 52. A lot of this is my life, crazy. Even down to the autistic firstborn and having diagnosed pcos, second baby, teaching etc.  Get out of my life! :) Lol - do you have a malformation in your shoulder causing impingement?\n\nI woke up last Monday with a weak arm. Finally went to urgent care on Wednesday because I could not lift it and got my first prednisone shot. So. Much. Relief. \n\nI felt marvelous!\n\nBut two weeks, 50 classes, and a Back to School Night later my crotchety old body is back with a vengeance. No but my husband does and just got a steroid shot!! lol", "MCTD or not? Just got blood work results, Negative ANA, but ENA showed up as positive because anti-RNA was 1.2, when the normal range was &lt;1.0. \nThe doctor said this is \u2018most consistent with MCTD\u2019, but is it possible for it not to be MCTD when it is not much higher than the range it is supposed to be in?\nHave not seen any other doctor or rheumatologist yet, waiting to get in. Blood test is only part of diagnosis and is not diagnostic. Once you see the rheumatologist you will have more of a clear answer. You would have to talk with a rheumatologist to know. It is all about a mixture of bloodwork + symptoms. I have a low positive RNP (1.6) but very clear features so I got a diagnosis. Someone can have very high positive numbers and if they do not have any symptoms, they most likely will not get a diagnosis. A rheumatologist would most likely just keep an eye on you to see if you end up getting symptoms. I have a working diagnosis of MCTD. Have not started medication yet, but my RNP is 1.4-1.6 Can I ask what a \u201cworking diagnosis\u201d means? Was it a rheumatologist who said it was most consistent with MCTD? It literally says on the blood work in brackets, under the RNP results \u201cthis pattern of results, positive anti-RNP in the absence of other autoantibodies, would be most consistent with a diagnosis of MCTD\u201d.\n\nIt was an allergy doctor who referred him for this test and she basically reiterated the quote I just posted above. His regular family doctor has seen the blood work but never said anything which makes me think she does not find it all that concerning? It means we cannot be 100% sure what my definitive  diagnosis is because my symptoms are mostly hair and skin issues and less \u201con the nose\u201d for MCTD. With the positive RNP test, low complements, along with my history of celiac, its a good indicator of MCTD, but until I try Plaquinil and see if it helps my symptoms, I cannot know for sure (as I have several other conditions). MCTD is rare so it is something that family doctors are not necessarily aware of. It certainly does not mean it is concerning as MCTD can be very mild, is manageable with medication and some people achieve long periods of remission. \nI would still recommend speaking to a rheumatologist as MCTD is something they are best placed to deal with.", "Need help- Positive ANA, FNP, and High Lymphocytes. I am a 24 Yr Old Female about to turn 25. For the past year, I have been to doctor after doctor telling me nothing is wrong with me. They would say I am too young to have any problems. Finally, I changed my old doctor to a new one that actually believed me. \n\nSymptoms:\n-Light sensitivity \n-Joint pain in kneecaps, wrists, elbows and ankles\n-Frequent urination\n-When it is cold I get itchy in my inner thighs when I walk and get hives.

I do not know if that means anything. \n\nThis was done when I was having medium pain but I feel like my pain has gotten worse. I have to wait till see the Rheumatologist at my next appointment to go over my results. I wanted to see if anyone else can share some stories that might give me some insight to what is going on? I cannot comment on the test results, but I can tell you that you are at the beginning of a long road, and being a strong advocate for yourself will make it better.  What country are you in, how far do you live from your Rheumy, and how far from a major medical center.  If this turns out to be MCTD, or a variant, you will need to keep good records, (start a notebook and keep ALL test results and reports in it).  You will need a good team, including a neurologist, a dermatologist, an internal med doc, your gynecologist, a good psychiatrist, and if your rheumatologist does not take you seriously, a new rheumatologist.\n\nSometimes people get lucky, and get a quick diagnosis.  Sometimes it takes years.  I am going to put some links here for you.  Do NOT search MCTD or autoimmune disease and be sucked into a bad mood.\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nGet back to us after you have read these i hope you like your doctor and feel like they support you and want to help you figure out what is going on. i had a positive ANA test for years and was not diagnosed until i was in my mid twenties. i have been using plaquenil and i can workout many days a week now without joint pain. ^agree that you have to be your own advocate! I had the exact same medical profile as you when I was 24 years old. My rheumatologist put off my symptoms as a thyroid issue which I had. Changing my rheumatologist to one in hopkins probably changed the course of my life. \n\nIF you are diagnosed with mctd then have them conduct a baseline test for all your organs. This will help you keep your organs stable with the right dosage and medications. Most of them who are diagnosed early live a normal life with the right medications. Do not google much about any conditions before you are diagnosed, the web is unnecessarily scary place.", "Thumb gloves I have had a couple of glasses of wine so I apologise for the title. \n\nI have been struggling with my thumbs for a few months; initially it was just the right one which periodically jammed in one position. Recently the other thumb decided to join in and start making its presence felt when doing basic things like using cutlery. \nMy partner surprised me with these today and so far,  I cannot recommend them highly enough. They do not do much for the first joint but the feeling of relief at my MCP joints was instantaneous.\n\n  Interesting! Thank you! I will check them out. I get trigger finger and carpal tunnel all the time. Still trying to figure out how to strengthen the tendons so they do not need to work so hard Before my fingers got too stiff, I found a Power Ball really helped strengthen my tendons and ligaments. It did not get rid of my tendinitis but it made it much easier to live with. It is basically a weighted ball, you pull a cord and it starts spinning in your hand and you use the momentum/resistance to strengthen your connective tissues. Nice! I have some hypermobility in my joints and I think these might work well for me too. ", "Hey fellow mctd peeps. I am new to this and was diagnosed a week ago. I have lupus and RA. So far I am on prednisone, and I hate it with a passion. The hunger and anger is crazy. Still have questions and concerns so if anybody has any advice let me know. ", "My wife got diagnosed with MCTD and she is flared up So a couple of months ago, my wife (who previously got diagnosed with Lupus) suffered from MCTD. At the first control, her anti-dsDNA is 715 with RF 64 IU/ML. Then the doctor gave her Cellcept, Intidrol, Oscal, and Plaquenil (all of them are 1x1 a day). Her anti-dsDNA-NCX went down to 461 with her RF is 64 IU/ML (positive) and then rise again to 502 and then 498.\n\nShe likes to take a walk into a mall or grocery store, and after several days of doing that, her anti-dsDNA going up again to 548. She does not like to read about MCTD so I try to learn myself and help her just in case something bad happened during her medication.\n\nNow, her dose is increased into 2x1 a day for Cellcept, 2x1 a day for Intidrol, 1x1 a day for Oscal, 1x1 for Plaquenil, Calcimag (Blackmores) 1x1 a day.\n\nAnd now, she tries to follow her diet' doctor who advises her to follow the following meal plan:\n\n1. avoid rice, flour, and sugar\n2. eat 2 a day and do intermittent fasting 16 hours (I think her eating schedules are 1 PM and 7 PM)\n3. The menu of the meals are Vegetables and meat (chicken, gizzard, etc.)\n\nI am not sure if the meal plan is good, or will affect her condition right now. So, I am asking here about:  \n1. does the anti-dsDNA really worst? What is the worst case for her that I should anticipate?\n\n2. Is it because of her habit that she flared up? Because the doctor says that she cannot be tired at all?\n\n3. I read the AIP diet, but I am not sure if it is also good for her?\n\n4. Sometimes she is mentally down, and I tried to entertain her. Based on her doctor, she cannot be stressed. But how can she avoid that? I mean stress is not something that can be detected.\n\nI do not know what to do right now, other than entertaining her and try to make her not stress. Diet wise the Mediterranean diet is very healthy and full of foods that have anti inflammatory properties. Try looking into it. It is very balanced and is extremely good for pretty much anybody.\n\nAnyone with MCTD can be tired. I do not really understand what you mean by this. I am as close to \u201cremission\u201d as I can be right now and I still get tired. It is just a part of the disease.\n\nAvoiding rice, flour and sugar is a good rule to follow for anyone really. These foods do not add a whole lot of benefit to us and can cause other issues. Basically she would do well just going low carb which is part of the Mediterranean diet anyway. Carbs can cause inflammation.\n\nStress is a natural part of life. Keeping stress levels low is good to try to control the flares. But you are correct - sometimes it cannot be avoided. We are surrounded by stress. Physical, emotional, we are in the middle of a pandemic, I cannot imagine there is a single adult in the world not experiencing some level of stress right now. But it is helpful to keep localized stress at a minimum- help her by keeping the house clean so she does not have to clean (this is huge, bending and activity of cleaning is painful on joints, having a clean house reduces stress for everyone who lives there) try to make sure she does not have to stress about things like mowing the lawn or snow shoveling, help out with the pets, make a shower or bath area that she enjoys spending time in (hot water helps our joint pain) make the bedroom nice and peaceful and airy and clean so she gets restful sleep etc.\nPeople do not think about their living areas as being stressful but they most certainly are (especially if you have kids)\n\nAs far as her numbers, these will eventually go down with medication but may take some experimenting guided by her doctor to find the right dose and types of medications. I am a big fan of low dose prednisone for flares as you feel immediate relief of some of the worse symptoms (like pain) until the medications have had a chance to really build up in her system and kick in. However, many people on this subreddit are anti prednisone and will try to say that it has worse side effects and it is a horrible drug and not to take it etc. but I will say that prednisone saved me from spiraling down a deep well of depression due to my symptoms and a low dose is low enough that the side effects are minimal. As long as the dose is really low dose (I am talking 5-10mg here a day, short term not more than a couple months) and you taper off correctly, it can be a beneficial drug in your arsenal of medications. If her doctor said she cannot be tired, get a new doctor.  She should not be eating organ meat (gizzard, etc).  Intermittent fasting is a good idea, but use 5/2 instead...it is easier on the system.  Google \u201cspoon theory MCTD\u201d, and let her read that.  Let her decide what to use her \u201cspoons\u201d for, and if she wants to walk, do that.  She needs to feel some control right now.  Rest is her best medicine during a flare, and then gentle stretches to preserve range of motion.  For reducing stress, try to clean out the living areas of any clutter, use bright lights during the day, and soft light at night.  Clutter induces stress.  Soft music in the background.  Occasionally blast some loud music she likes, if she can enjoy moving to it.  It clears the head.  Listen to her.  That is what she needs the most.  And keep posting here to let us know, tell her we are wanting to hear from her. Thank you very much for your answer. For the anti-dsDNA is it possible to go below 100 in her current condition?\n\nAnd what is 5/2? Sorry I do not understand about IF. Is it the same as 5:2? Hi, Thank you for your explanation. I will definitely look into the Mediterranean diet. As for \"tired\", well here is what the doctor said:\n\n1. Since my wife likes to go to the mall, the doctor said she should be on bed rest until the anti-dsDNA down to normal. That is I think the part when she is become stress.\n2. She cannot be outside the house at certain time when the Sun is high (she need to avoid direct contact with the Sun)\n\nI hope it clears some confusion. The responses given by previous posters was very thorough. I just wanted to say that you are an amazing, supportive spouse! Often times, this is EXACTLY what we need when not well. I hope you both find some simple solutions to lessen the symptoms. Good luck! Yes. The medication interacts with the sunlight and sunlight in general can cause flares in some people. I cannot speak to the numbers on the ANA.  By 5(2, I mean 5 days you eat normal, 2 days you eat only 500 cal. Thank you for your responses. \n\nDoes my wife need to do a low-carb diet? or just IF? I am not sure if IF or low carb has an impact on my wife's condition tbh. Thank you for your kind response I see, noted on that. I remember there is one day when she gets contacted to the sunlight, and I am not sure if it is one of the causes that her ANA increased. Neither am I!   The  only diet I have seen that may impact  the disease is the AIP diet that some people use.", "Poll for the Community: On a scale of 1-10, how intense are your average daily symptoms? Hey all, let us do a community check in and see how everyone is rating their average daily symptoms these days and how it compares to the poll we did almost 2 months ago. If you were to think of the last 6 months, on average, how have you felt?\n\n( I realized as I was giving my answer, just how much my \u201cpain tolerance\u201d has gone up. Most \u201cnormal\u201d people would think the pain I live with on a day to day basis is severe to intolerable but for me, it is just another day. Sure there is pain and it is a hell of a nuisance but if I have the energy and ability to get a couple things done, I consider it a good day! I guess it is all about perspective... has anyone else noticed a change in their pain scale tolerance? Can some of you name your symptoms? I currently have lots of fatigue and right arm arm pain. I wake up very stiff in my entire body and with a lot of pain in my hands (arthritic tendinitis). After some heat and ice therapy on my hands and some movement for my body I generally feel pretty good with less pain throughout my body. Fatigue for me sets in in the afternoon and lasts until I go to bed. In the late evening my stiffness and pain sets back in. My main symptoms are fatigue (flu like especially in fall/winter), rheumatoid arthritis most annoyingly in my hands and jaw but throughout most of my joints now. I occasionally get non-joint related arm pain but my hunch is that a nerve is being pinched by the arthritis inflammation. *Disclaimer: I am not on any medication for my illness.* My fatigue has been getting worse in the fall too. My doctor wants me to try hydroxychloroquine but then said that a SE is fatigue... I too have been prescribed hydroxychloroquine. I think it is pretty hit or miss whether or not the side effects are disruptive or not but it sounds like after a couple months the side effects might let up a bit and ultimately it could help... but then again I have not started it since I am reluctant too. Maybe other folks on here have some thought about it... I do know that my symptoms have only progressed over time and if you/I wait too long to try the meds then we could ( I already have) trade fatigue for much more pain. It is so tricky and from my research everyone responds different so do not feel rushed to make a decision and look for support! I wld say 6-7.  Often difft areas/issues from day to day.  I must say tho- I also have times with zero pain prob 3/4 the time. I feel like I am at a 3-4, but then I will hit a wall and jump to like an 8 because I overdid it. I have got like a 4 hour window and when I have spent my 4 hours, sh*t goes down real quick. Currently on both methotrexate and hydroxycholoroquine. I have felt pretty okay all things considered for the last 6 months but that is because I do not work anymore and can take my day at my own pace. But even when I do things \"perfectly\" I will still have 1-2 days a week where I am pretty useless and cannot do more than get out of bed and take care of personal hygiene. Emotional stress and cold/damp fronts can knock me on my ass as well. Sounds just like me. I am not on meds yet but I too am relatively functional between 10-3pm and then I start to flare, pretty consistently day to day, to the point that I hate the idea of getting out of bed for anything. It is tough. I also tend to get my worst symptoms in fall which I have noticed for the last 3 years... I am starting to miss summer already I do not think people realize just how much Raynaud's can impact you. Fall/winter are so awful because of it. Like I cannot even get stuff out of the freezer without gloves, so when I am out in cold damp weather it is like my whole body folds in on itself. But truly, meds saved my life. I started on just hydroxychloroquine which helped a lot with the joint aches, stiffness, and pain. As well as little things like rashes, mouth sores, and swollen lymph nodes. But then the methotrexate has helped my muscle tenderness and fatigue and got my blood levels back on track. But it is all a daily thing. Some days I almost feel like a 28 year old should, some days my 60 year old mother out paces me on a walk haha, and some days I cannot even wash my own face or change my clothes without help. Just a roll of the dice :/ I 100% relate to what you are describing, I take each day in strides now and just do what I can. Thanks for sharing your experience!", "Not Dead Yet: A Month In Rewind Hello everyone! I just wanted to say thank you and to let you know how excited I am to see some consistent activity on our sub! Over the last 30 days or so our community of \"rarities\" has grown by more than 60 new members. That means that no matter how small of a population we are, there are always people out there looking for the same thing that brought *you* here - a place to be understood, get tips, and make sense of it all. Thank you all for your interaction with the daily posts. We have had some interesting and helpful feedback from the polls this month. To recap some of the feedback from our active community:\n\n* \\***Our community is roughly 3:1 (Female:Male)**\\*\n* \\*44% of us have full-time jobs (although, changing that seems to be a common desire for many).\\*\n* \\*Most of us need at least 7 hours of sleep per night to feel \"normal\"; **55% of that group require 9 or**   \n**more**\\*\n* \\*36% of us live in large cities, a close second to the 46% who live in suburban towns. None of those who answered live in the mountains.\\*\n* \\*The majority of our community developed their symptoms early in life. 53% were between 20-40\\*\n* \\*We are a fairly well-rounded community when it comes to having children\\*\n* \\*55% of us have tried gluten-free diets to help with symptoms; the results were split 50/50. Almost 20% of us are against ever trying gluten-free (it is in almost everything)\\*\n* \\*We have at least one person in this community who is here supporting a loved one with MCTD!\\*\n* \\*We have a community that seems more than willing to be open and honest about their experience with MCTD in order to help others struggling with the same fate.\\*\n\nTo our new members, welcome and thank you for helping us build an interactive and empathetic space for our community to learn, grow, and support one another. I hope you all can find some comfort in knowing that you are not alone. Please feel free to reach out to me directly with any concerns or recommendations for our sub. Otherwise, I will continue what I have been doing and do my best to keep the discussions/polls interesting and informative. ***Thanks again for keeping the discussion lively; we are not dead yet!*** &gt;\\*We have at least one person in this community who is here supporting a loved one with MCTD!\\*\n\nYou sure do! :)  My wife was diagnosed recently and I am trying to figure out how best to be supportive. This small community has been very helpful and I am glad I found it. \n\nThank you all so much for all the helpful tips! Thank you for supporting your wife! She is extremely lucky to have you and our community benefits from having input from your perspective! This community has been very helpful. It makes it all a lot less scary to deal with. She is been helped quite a bit by tips from this collection of strangers :)\n\nEven just knowing that there are others with this condition is helpful. I am all too happy to help when I can, whether that is to offer the perspective of a loved one or to tell someone something that helped my lady. I have really enjoyed the polls and how active it has made the community. We need more people like you in the world :) Thanks for your feedback! It can be tricky for me to know if I am helping or just being annoying so as long as it is helping at least one person, I am happy! Could do with a few more like her too ;) This is such a lovely post Thank you! The polls are great! And the info that comes from them so interesting! Especially the gluten free fact above. I am gluten free but found it does not really do much. I have gone dairy free and no help. I am on a \u201cflexible\u201d Candida diet, mostly no refined sugars and it is been a month and not seeing much difference. Yet. My naturopath said we are giving it 1-2 months but it is so hard not to be discouraged. Thanks for the group. It helps knowing I am not alone. Lovely feedback, thank you. Hang in there - I know some diets can take months to have an effect. Some things my husband does to be supportive of me:\n\nIf I need something from another floor of the house, he will get up and go get it for me rather than make me climb the stairs.\n\nHe will give me massages when I need them. He will put lidocaine on me when I need it.\n\nHe will go to the grocery store or pharmacy etc. to keep me away from the general public so I do not get sick.\n\nHe is involved in my doctor visits to make sure I do not forget anything when talking to my doctor.\n\nHe will tell me to go lay down and take a break if I am tired.\n\nHe will do household chores like cook dinner or do the dishes if I am not feeling up to it. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. It is really difficult and isolating at first diagnosis so it is nice there are others out there. I actually have been dealing with severe health issues since 1997 and have been all over the world for treatment of another \u201crare\u201d disease. Now this.. can I catch a break?? I am trying to remain positive and not give up on everything I still want to accomplish in life. I appreciate your post more than you know!", "Anyone want to mod this sub ?

But for the past few months I have gotten small hives on right hand that will come and go. They returned this week and are worse than they usually are. There does not seem to be any specific trigger. Has anybody else gotten hives after being on plaquenil? Or do you think I am just randomly allergic to something? Hiya! I got the exact same thing, my first year on plaquenil. I did not really make the association, I guess I just thought it was from the disease, not the meds! I would get them randomly, come and go, and I could not place a trigger to them. So, it probably was the plaquenil! I stopped getting them after some time, though! I had things that match this description once before &amp; once after starting plaquenil.

I have lost a lot of tissue. I had the same experience last summer (!). A cycle of Iloprost worked wonders...", "Wound healing Does anyone else have issues with wound healing? I posted a week and a bit ago about my impending skin biopsy. That happened, it was a walk in the park and I thought it healed beautifully...until the stitches came out. The nurse barely finished saying \"that looks good, you will not have much of a scar...\" before the damn thing did some kind of slow motion horror movie reopening on us. \nIt is not healing, despite steri strips and in a few hours, I am due to see my rheumatologist who I have a fractious relationship with. \nI am scared he is going to blame me for my biopsy site being a disaster; due to covid I cannot take anyone with me and currently I want to cry.\n\nIt is not just the biopsy site, it is old scars that I have had for years. A couple of scars that are nearly ten years old reopened on my leg and I do not know if this is an MCTD thing or an I have screwed up somehow thing. 1.  It is not your fault.\n2.  If the doc says it is, stand up, pick up you things, and turn around, walk out of the room to the front desk. Tell them you want to sign a record release form, and you want yours printed out now.\n3.  Practice this move at home.  Practice the script at home.\n4.   Tell the office you will not pay for the visit, and your insurance company will not either.  Then go home and call your insurance company to alert them. \n5.  Find a dermatologist to talk to about enhanced wound healing.\n6.  Find another rheumatologist.  Call the clinic admin and ask for a referral or the medical association or contact MCTD organization near you.\n\nIf the rheumy does not blame you, tell the doc you want a referral for a wound clinic. Have you tried using Vaseline on the wounds? I ask because I am getting a hard cyst removed off my shin next month and the dermatologist said I would have a few stitches but also somewhat of an open wound and would have to keep Vaseline on it to heal. I am also not supposed to take prednisone at that time as that can keep it from healing. But I am also scared of it not healing. My wounds tend to get worse when I use vaseline. My dermatologist told me to keep the wound as dry as possible. \nThat is interesting; I have refused Prednisone because the idea of mixing bipolar, diabetes and steroids terrifies me. If it was just bipolar or just diabetes I would not mind as much. I have to use steristrips, not stitches. They are the only things that keep me from having keloid scarring. It is on my forearm. The aftercare sheet mentioned legs and torsos as being prone to damage, but not arms.  \nFortunately it is looking a bit better today but I will get in touch with my dermatologist. Thanks for the suggestion. I ended up with steristrips in the end.  I scar badly but I am so glad I do not have to deal with keloid scarring. Having had one on the back of an ear piercing, I would happily never deal with another one! Mine was a cartilage piercing - I would have been seriously pissed off if even my earlobes hated me lol Not a doctor, and just diagnosed with MCTD today.... Are you also hypermobile? Maybe look into another connective tissue disorder called Ehlers Danlos. It involves skin issues that include poor wound healing. I actually went to Rheum seeking that diagnosis, and we also find MCTD while trying to rule out rheumatological disorders. No, fortunately I do not have EDS. It seems like a really tough condition to live with.  Thanks for the suggestion, though.", "Please help. High probability for an autoimmune disorder Let me start out by saying that my family has a long history of autoimmune disorders and weird medical conditions. \n\nMy mom has antiphospholipid syndrome, hashimotos, some other AI disorder that I do not know the name of where her lips basically blister, scab over, and then peel off anytime she has a lip injury like if she cuts/bites her lip or they get too chapped and crack, and likely some other AI disorders that she has not been diagnosed with yet or has not told me about because I worry. She has harlequin syndrome likely resulting from one of the several TIAs she is had as a result of her blood clotting disorder. She also has been diagnosed with prolonged QT syndrome, a MTHFR gene mutation leading to chronic folate/b12 deficiency, and also has a history of multiple gynecolic/reproductive issues. \n\nMy maternal great grandmother died of scleroderma, my maternal grandmother and paternal aunt both have reynaud's, and my maternal great grandfather died of a blood clot at a very young age back before Antiphospholipid Syndrome was well known, so it is suspected that he had that too. \n\nAs for me (27F), I have an abundance of chronic abnormal symptoms that align with some type of connective tissue disorder. I had an ANA taken 4 years ago that came back negative, and some time prior to that also tested negative for thyroid antibodies. While I realize I cannot get a real diagnosis online and plan to eventually get in to see a rheumatologist for a full work up, I was hoping for some insight from anyone willing to share. While I have done considerable research, there is always the possibility that my issues align with something I have never heard of. \n\nAs for my symptoms... I apologize for the extensive list in advance \n\n-I definitely suffer from Reynaud's phenomenon that results in severe chilblains. My fingers become extremely swollen, red, painful, and I get sores, firm nodules, and the capillaries break and cause bleeding under the skin. \n-I have also been diagnosed with Prolonged QT syndrome and have had 2 episodes of a hypertensive crisis with dangerously high blood pressure for no known reason\n-Joint pain\n-My knee dislocated randomly a year or so ago when I was sitting in a chair and crossed my legs\n-Chronic fatigue\n-Headaches\n-Progressively worsening vision\n-Conjunctival erosion \n-Chronic dry skin/ peeling lips\n-A scaly rash around my mouth\n-Diffuse itching\n-Random painful scalp bumps\n-Terrible indigestion, frequent heartburn, and am prone to constipation\n-Treatment Resistant depression/anxiety and other mental health issues\n-Brain fog\n-Insomnia/hypersomnia\n-Heat intolerance\n-Concave chest (pectus excavatum) that developed in my early 20s\n-Ear pressure/tinnitus with random bouts of a loud whooshing sound followed by vertigo \n-Extremely sensitive skin to lotions, products, fragrances, etc\n-Occasional swollen lymph nodes in my armpits\n-Nail spooning, dry peeling nails, ridges \n\nThank you to anyone who has actually read this far. Again, any insight or opinions are greatly appreciated I highly recommend reading \u201cBrave New medicine\u201d talks about autoimmune from a doctors first hand perspective as well as how family genetics can play a role and even how to stop them from playing a role. Pretty cool", "Have any of you Had covid? If so, would you mind sharing your experience? My wife has MCTD and Lupus and had it, she had minor fatigue and a bit of a cough. Not too hard on her at all. Really?? That is good! I am glad it was not too bad! I had it last March. Initially I thought it was just a flare (joint pain, fatigue etc) ... then the cough started. While my case was mild, I never want to experience that awful barking cough again. It did not sound human and my lungs felt like they were being scoured with hot sand. It took me until the end of May to fully get over it, although my lungs still are not OK. \nI have had to cut back on the amount of Naproxen I take because it makes me wheeze. \n\nPeople compare it to having the flu, but I disagree. I have never felt as sick as I did when I had flu; for me, covid did not come close to that but it is relentless. It lasts so much longer and that is what makes it so horrible. I am sorry you went through that. I hope your lungs get better soon. Thank you for sharing. I have mctd and lupus and had covid april/March of 2020. It was the worst infection of my life. I knew that I was not going to die but I felt like I was dying. I had 105 F fevers and I was having hallucinations/ delusions. For a week straight I did not move out the bed\u2014 only to pee. I was very red and flushed. I puked up everything for the first few days and those were the worst but once I started eating again \u2014 the fevers slowly got lower and the rest of my Covid symptoms subsided. The doctors were cluesless. They put me on three different antibiotics and high dose steroids. The only thing that saved me was the lack of respiratory symptoms. I was short of breath and my sats were off but no cough or restrictions and that is what pretty much saved me. From a rhematologic standpoint- it took about two months to get better. My joints were really stiff and I was sooo weak. I was having really bad muscle spasms. \n\nI am very lucky to be alive and although it was bad\u2014 I made it through. I have MCTD and asthma and I had it end of December. I honestly thought I was having a really bad flare up and a random chest infection, but then the cough just got worse so I got tested. The worst was trying to sleep at night. Breathing was not easy and nothing felt comfortable. Somehow though I did not get a fever or really anything else. A little nauseous but I could not really tell if it was normal autoimmune nausea or from covid. I mostly slept for about a week, drank a lot of Liquid IV/Gatorade, and took a lot of Tylenol. And I do not think it is been long enough for me to really know about any long term effects, so we will see. I was really lucky, all things considered. Hope you are able to avoid it! So incredibly glad you are alive. Thank you so much for sharing. Thank you. I am glad you made it through all of that. I remember when I had a pulmonary embolism. Laying down was not an option. That hurt way too much. Anyway, so so glad you are okay. I will say, regardless of where your health is at, it can still be minor/severe because the virus is so unpredictable. We are at a bit more risk, but it is not set in stone how our body would react to it\n\nMy girlfriends uncle is 92, has a laundry list of chronic conditions, lives in a retirement home, and STILL only had a low fever for like 2 days. My mom, who is 50 but in good health, eats healthy, would work out every day, no chronic conditions, was extremely sick for the whole two weeks and almost had to go to the hospital", "Diagnosed with Psoriatic arthritis but I fit the description for MCTD. (31M)For 4 years now I have been dealing with joint pain, two years with reflux and 2 years with lower back pain around the SI joints, plus nerve pain issues in my legs. The issue is, I have been to so many different specialists and nobody considers the connections. I feel like its all connected because I was fine 4 years ago. I was able to hike, kayak, play golf, work out, and dance. \n\nSince then, the joint issues and tendon pain have worsened and spread. Originally the pain, swelling and redness started in my knees. Over the course of these last few years I have developed pain in my ankles, wrists, fingers, shoulders, lower back and neck. Other than my knees, I typically do not have much swelling, just a small about in my hands and ankles at times. \n\nI also have neuropathic pain all over my legs and in my feet. I have muscle spasms, and muscle twitching all over my body as well. I also seems to have a lot of muscle pain now as well. My heart rate has been increased for weeks now, along with feeling shaky and fatigued. I develop severe insomnia since I have had the elrvated heart rate. Rheumatologist says it is not related to PsA and to see a neurologist. \nNeurologist already ruled out MS. Only thing I have is a bulging disc at L5-S1 but it is not compressing any nerves according to the radiology report.\n\nI have also suffered from bouts of severe heartburn and indigestion. Sometimes it is so bad that it does not respond to Nexium. I had an upper endoscopy and was told I had mild, chronic gastritis. I have taken sulfasalazine and very briefly took methotrexate, but not long enough to make a difference. I always respond to steroids, always. I have never taken a maintenance dose, only taper packs and injections.\n\n I am HLA-B27 negative. All of my bloodwork comes back normal. The tests i know he ran are Sed rate, RF ,and ANA. Not sure if he has specifically tested for MCTD. Doctor is 50/50 that I have a spondyloarthropathy but still trying me on Humira. I am very worried that I do not have PsA and that I have MCTD. /u/Appropriate_Power216, I have found an error in your post:\n\n &gt; \u201cfeel like ~~its~~  all connected\u201d\n\nI declare the post of you, Appropriate_Power216, unsuitable; it should say \u201cfeel like ~~its~~  all connected\u201d instead. \u2018Its\u2019 is possessive; \u2018it is\u2019 means \u2018it is\u2019 or \u2018it has\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!)  \n\nThis is how my raynauds looks when I get cold and it is definitely diagnosed raynauds\n\nNot all symptoms have to be related and people with one autoimmune disease have a higher risknof overlapping disease (more than one autoimmune disease)\n\nSome things you have may not be autoimmune at all but something else entirely\n\nHave you had bloodwork done? What were those results if so? Mine definitely do not get that white. \n\nBut yes, I have had lots of bloodwork done. Everything has been normal except my liver enzymes have been elevated a few times and my billirubin has been elevated. I have had negative ANA and I am HLA-B27 negative. I do not think I have been tested for the one specific antigen found in MCTD. \n\nPart of me thinks the neurological stuff may be unrelated. One thing I could not find much literature on is whether MCTD causes enthesitis. I seem to get enthesitis like most people with spondyloarthropathies but I also have wrist and ankle involvement that fits more with RA.\n\nPlus I have the upper GI issues that seem common with MCTD. If you respond to the Humira, it might be a moot point.  There is so much overlap that sometimes getting a diagnosis is no help.  I would definitely get a more specific work up, if you can manage it.  Where are you located?  Near any major teaching hospital? I agree with you there. I suppose I am just nervous to try Humira without knowing exactly what is going in. \n\nI would say the closest and best one might be University of Kentucky or Ohio State. My BFF was having joint and skin problems.  I took her to my rheumatologist, who I swore would get her diagnosed with PsA.  He blew her off.\n\nIt took me months to get her into a dermatologist, who put her on Humira, and her life quality improved 100%.  I am hoping the same for you.  I would certainly do some research on which major teaching centers specialize near you.  I go to Mayo for my MCTD.  With connective tissue diseases, getting a definite name to use as diagnosis is difficult It took me nearly two years of seeing this rheumatologist for him to request the Humira. I still have to find out if its going to be covered. He said he was diagnosing me with PsA because I did not quite fir the criteria for AS. I do not even have psoriasis! I definitely seem to have inflammatory back pain though. I just get a lot of other strange tendon pains that are not really typical of spondyloarthropathies, plus muscle pain in my arms and legs as well.\n\nI am glad your friend found some relief! I have heard great things about Humira and some of the other biologics. \n\nI guess I never realized how difficult it is to diagnose this stuff sometimes. Its been tough, as you know, having all these issues but getting no answers. The only relief I get is from steroids and occasionally an NSAID. The good news is because there is so much overlap with autoimmune diseases, many of them respond well to the same medications, for example I have mctd but its comprised of a little of part A (lupus) a little of part B (scleroderma) and the medication is the same for all 3 (typically plaquenil or the generic hydroxychloroquin) with the occasional prednisone steroid for flare ups. So you may not get an exact perfect diagnosis but the medications may still help. Thanks! Plaquenil is one of the only DMARDs I have not tried actually. Steroids help but I feel like I need them like once per month. Hopefully I respond well to Humira. Once you are on a drug for a period of time and your immune system is suppressed and everything calms down, you should not need the monthly steroids or any maintenance prednisone etc. typically the primary medication is enough to keep things at bay. It took me 7 months before I felt what I consider good, for some people it takes 3 months to see a difference. But looking back it is like night and day, I used to cry walking up and down stairs. Simple things like sitting on a toilet/standing up from one or from a chair, getting into a car, sitting in a straight chair, walking on inclines etc. all just destroyed me. I also kept having disk ruptures and pain in my spine joints (S1/L5 primarily) and was taking two aleve a day just to get by - now even my back has calmed down and does not hurt. The drugs for me personally were a miracle, but they definitely took time to work. Be patient and keep hope!", "Anti Smith AG Ribonuclear Protein question in comment  Anybody know what this test is supposed to mean or relate to? I know there is a lot of other factors that go into a diagnosis. But what is this test and why is it included in standard ENA panel??? Old rheumie was terrible btw. Really hard to talk to. Seeing new one soon and I will ask but curious if anyone here knows. I cannot find anything online about this measure. I do not know if maybe it has alternate names or something?", "What is your worst/most annoying symptom? Mine is definitely the Raynaud's. It was the second symptom to ever appear and has gradually gotten worse and worse and cannot be managed with medication.", "Anyone have trouble with joint mobility? All of my joints have some limited mobility, it is especially worse in my wrists (they cannot bend backward for things like push ups or holding a tray). Does anyone else experience this? Was there anything you did to help it? I would not say I have limited mobility in the sense that I can still move the way I could but I definitely struggle with my joint pain doing push-ups or yoga poses, carrying things etc. YES and it is awful. Easily the most frustrating part of this so far. I have done two tapers of prednisone and it gets much better at 40mg, but quickly returns afterward. I recently went sugar and carb free for a week and was amazed at the improvement. Going to try that for a longer stint and see if it is consistent. Best of luck to you! Yes, I definitely had issues before I started Plaquenil. I am finally able to do push ups again thanks to the meds! But before I had so much trouble and just avoided anything with my wrists and fingers. Yeah, I have got that. Honestly just doing basic stretches helps, just as you would increase mobility in any normal joint. I think of it as just a reduced baseline mobility Yeah, with the wrists definitely. They have been hurting when I bend them far backwards for a year now, so I learned to avoid the movement (car seat belts, backpack straps etc)\n\nMCTD with anthralgia only, no arthritis. Before my DMARD treatment, I was unable to stretch out my elbows fully before they got blocked accompanied by a searing jolt of pain. That fortunately stopped under therapy! My wrist and elbow\u2019s would be frozen at times before DMARDS  .  If you are not on corticosteroids, ask your doctor for a 2 week taper of prednisone or equivalent( do not rely on these long term they are god awful for your body ) .", "Plaquenil Hey you all, almost three years since being diagnosed and I have had to resign to starting plaquenil today, just hoping for some idea of what to expect. I delayed this long because the potential side effects sound awful, but real life, what do you all most commonly experience? Thanks in advance for sharing! I hear also of horrible side effects of plaquenil but I have been on it 10 years and have had almost no side effects. The most I get is an occasional (perhaps once a month) momentary ringing in the ears. Other than that-none! Hey! I am recently diagnosed so cannot speak for long term effects but hydrochloroquine made massive improvements to my fatigue and pain. I would probably have to quit my job without it. I would recommend anyone in our situation to give it a fair go. I have had no/minimal side effects, but of course it is highly individualistic. The positive impact can take a few weeks to become apparent so do not be disheartened if you start and there is no change for a bit. If it does not work there are plenty of other meds to try, but this one is pretty safe and commonly prescribed so it is worth trialling it IMO. Well, I already have some of that so here is hoping it does not increase, haha. That is good to hear, thank you! I have always been aware it would end up here, I just wanted to delay the inevitable as long as possible due to the vision side effects and my already dismal eye sight, and historically I do not react \u201cnormally\u201d to medications (metabolize pain meds very quickly and experienced the gamut of insanity that is topamax when I started that) so its going to be an anxious few weeks. I 110% feel you on the job front. I have gone to a less physically demanding role already and it sucks. I delayed for a while. Then went on it and felt so great 6 months later I asked to come off of it cause I wanted to be sure it was that and not something else I had done (got IUD and got my iron level fixed) and now 6 months after quitting I regret that decision. I say give it a try. I have been on Plaquenil for about three years so far and have not had any negative side effects. Get my eyes checked every six months to be sure there is no changes. For me, at least, it definitely changed my life for the better. Good luck! I have been on it 3.5 years, and have no side effects. I get my eyes checked regularly. Initially, it made a huge difference in my joint pain, inflammation, and fatigue. Lately, not so much...so it is probably time for me to increase the dose. But I do not hesitate to. Of course, your experience could be different, but it has been so worth it to me to be able to function somewhat normally. Great question! I too have been putting off taking my prescribed Plaquenil. Partially for side effects but mainly because I have held out hope that I could do something more natural (balance hormone levels, kill any virus that might be hiding in my system) but my doctors (and myself) have become less patient and my symptoms grow worse since I alone have not been able to stabilize anything. I have the pill bottle on my counter as I am thinking I may start it as well just to give my body and mind a break from all the pain. Then I will go back to working through all the natural triggers for autoimmune. Thanks for posting, I think it is going to help me over the hump of taking the medication. Yeah I have tried to control progression with diet and exercise this whole time and it is a struggle to put it mildly. It is exhausting. Best of luck to us! I was just diagnosed with UCTD and prescribed Plaquenil, I have been taking it for about a week. No side effects so far! Honestly, for me, I would be willing to bear with some of the minor side effects (nausea, dizziness) if it meant I no longer had to deal with the intense fatigue I have every day. Any other side effects are very rare, from what I understand. But I would definitely recommend giving it a shot! If you have side effects and they are too much to handle, you can try something else. But at least you would know! And maybe Plaquenil will make you feel heaps better! I have had zero side effects on the name brand. I had quality of life back around the 3 month mark, and was doing pretty well around the six month mark. \n\nLast fall, my pharmacy switched me to the generic and I got SO, SO sick. Worst flare I have ever had. I thought I was going to need a handicap placard. I also had a miscarriage. Pharmacy noticed and switched me back to name brand and I was fine again. Some people cannot metabolize the generics is what I learned. It was like going off of it cold turkey for me. Just stumbled on to your post. I have been on HCQ (not sure if it is brand or not - too lazy to check the bottle.) Ha ha. I will be on it for 3 months on December 29. So far, I have had little to no side effects, some minor gastro issues early and mild ones here and there. I have read it can take 3 up to 6 months to really work. As far as it helping, I have to say as of now, no significant life altering improvements. I have noticed that after I wake up it is bad, but that my stiffness and joint and muscle pain improve quicker and there are many days after a few hours after waking that I almost feel normal. I did have days like that pre-HCQ but I feel like they are happening more on it. I also have noticed my muscle soreness is not as bad as well. I have not noticed a difference in my muscle weakness though. I wish I could get that back - I may someday. Or not. I see my rheumatoid doc mid January. I think I will see if she lets me go another 3 months on it before we try methotrexate. Which in a pandemic, not the path I will choose to walk just yet :) \n\nI did agonize for months about taking it due to hearing all the side effects, but for me, it was much ado about nothing (so far)! Good luck!\n\nEdited to add: my issues are mainly my shoulders, with joint pain and muscle soreness, weakness, etc. my wrists, hands and fingers are swollen and my knees are slightly swollen as well. My shoulders are the main issue. Other than that nothing too crazy. I am in PT for my shoulders because I have very limited range of motion, think difficulties with putting on a bra or a jacket. Anything reaching behind me I struggle with. PT has helped. I think I can pin point that my rotator cuffs are very swollen. I still play tennis twice a week and exercise daily. Not letting this slow me down!", "\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b I fucked up!!!! \n\nI had no self control over the last week and have eaten like shit. I have had an excess of sugars, carbs, and fatty foods. \n\nNow I have rashes all over my body and my acid reflux is off the charts. \n\nI also skipped out on my physical activities and now I am super fatigued and it hurts to walk upstairs. Like my muscles are just vibrating. \n\nI feel like such an idiot. I knew better and I did it anyway. My raynauds have also been extremely bad. My hands and feet were purple for a period of 30min to an hour on and off all day. I feel like as soon as my extremities get circulation again they go right back to being purple. UGH wtf is wrong with me. \n\nDoes anyone else slip up like this? Yes, we do.  Pro tip...try wearing a neck scarf.  It helps to keep the core warm, and your hands and feet will thank you. No way?? Thank you so much!!!! I actually have a ton of really cute scarfs. \n\nDo you guys ever worry about what others will think? I know it is dumb to care, I know it is and I do things like wear gloves in the summer anyway... but I just hate the weird looks I get and then people ask questions and it is draining. I used to worry.  But, now I get compliments on my fashion.  I wore a derby with a face shield and mask (with a cute dress) into the hair salon,  and the stylist said \u201cI wondered who that was out there with so much style!\u201d  And a scarf works as a cute mask in a pinch It happens to all of us. Everyone has days where they slip up and then pay for it, it is all part of the learning curve of living with a chronic illness and it is just human nature.\nDo not beat yourself up, take some time to do things that will help make you more comfortable and rest as much as possible. \ud83e\udd7a thank you \ud83d\ude4f Back when I was still working in an office I was always a bit self conscious. I lived in a city so I took public transit to work. I bundled up big time even in 65 degree weather (gloves, scarves, jacket, beanie, the whole shebang) and would get comments from coworkers that I looked like I traveled from Antarctica. They were not aware yet that my health was drastically declining and bundling up was a way for me to combat symptoms ( most normal people do not have to consider stuff like that). They did not do it intentionally and eventually when they heard of my illness, they get terrible for having poked fun. But now I have learned that I need to accept myself and not worry what other people say. Sometimes I will show them my white fingers and crack a joke or something. It is easier said than done to not feel silly but it is ultimately for your health and very freeing to not care what assumptions others make. It takes practice but you will get there Thank you! I am getting there.. I was somewhat recently diagnosed and am still learning how to manage all of this. You guys help a lot, thank you!!", "Help with labs please?!?! Hi,\nI am new to the thread!

Try using an app or a journal so you can provide your doctors with a detailed picture of what is going on. I use Bearable (r/BearableApp) but there are loads of apps to choose from. Thank you- keeping a journal is a great idea! I will def try out a few. Good luck, I hope it helps. FWIW, Bearable, Fibro Mapp and Pixel are the best I found. Bearable is by far the best, but the others are good. Wow - Bearable is awesome! I just downloaded and got started. Thanks again for the recommendation! You are very welcome.

Sending strength this week to my fellow mixies \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb  I love this!", "THC for MCTD? I have been struggling with MCTD symptoms (and other things that overlap with it) for over a year now and have been diagnosed &amp; actively treating it for the past 6 months. I was on prednisone and plaquenil for my extreme inflammation flare ups but am starting to taper down the prednisone as it is not good for the body long term. \n\nI have read several posts here that plaquenil still helps keep MCTD in check. Along with MCTD (and other things like Raynauds, arthritis, tachycardia etc), I also deal with severe anxiety. \n\nI have tried to use THC in the past for my anxiety but noticed that it also helped with my flare ups and inflammation. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had more input on this? If you have tried THC for inflammation/other symptoms and it has helped? If it is worth using THC medically for this purpose? This sub is dead, unfortunately. I loathe the fact that I have to say this, but find the mctd Facebook group. It is active daily. Only incapacitating doses of edibles keep my inflammation in check . Anything less than that does not help much and ramps up my anxiety . Take advantage and stretch when high to keep yourself flexible , it feels great .  I had success making my own CBD tincture from cannatonic and BaOX strains . Commercial CBD products have not done anything for me . You might want to try posting this on r/autoimmunity which is more active.\nPlaquenil is really helping to keep my MCTD under control. My rheumatologist dropped my dose in November and it proved to me just how much I need it. I went up to the full dose again in March and I am just starting to feel a bit more human now.\nI have no experience of THC because it is illegal in the UK. If you can access it, I guess it is worth a try. I think I would talk to your doctor about what your best options are and how you can keep your anxiety under control. I found Propranolol really helpful for both palpitations and anxiety, but had to switch to a different drug because it seemed to be aggravating my Raynaud's and it was not doing enough to control my blood pressure during a flare.\nI have found Naproxen and Glucosamine helpful for coping with inflammation. I still have pain and swelling, but the combination of those two drugs and Plaquenil really make a noticeable difference. I also take glucosamine, I think it really makes a difference. In addition to a turmeric/bromelin combo, vitamin d and magnesium... on top of Plaquenil but that is kind of a given on this sub. Never tried thc either but I do wonder about cbd. I do wish it was more active in here. Did not know about the fb group - thanks! I have a medical marijuana card and I have found THC does wonders for my inflammation. The coconut oil infused with THC is my favorite. I rub it on the joints that are in pain (usually my wrists and fingers) and the pain stops within a few minutes. It is like magic.", "Headache and low grade fever as the only symptoms? I have been sick for over a year since I got some kind of virus (I think) and never got better. With countless visits to different specialists, they could not find anything wrong except for positive ANA (160:1 speckled), strongly positive anti-ro52 (one of the SSA antibodies, SSA is negative), and slightly elevated thyroid antibodies. I had quite a few other symptoms when I first got sick but the only thing that continued is a neverending tension headache 24/7 and a low grade fever every day since then. The second test showed lower ANA 100:1 speckled and also strongly positive anti-ro52. All other tested antibodies are negative. My reumathologist did not tell me much but I saw she wrote MCTD as a diagnosis on my papers. She also prescribed Hydroxychloroquine but I did not start taking it yet. I am first trying to switch my diet and see if that helps.\n\nFrom what I see, people with MCTD usually have very different symtoms than me so I am not even sure MCTD is my problem. Anyone else having a persistent headache and a low grade fever as their symtoms? My first symptom was a low grade fever.  I was not diagnosed for several years.  Here are some articles for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n Thank you for the links. I have much to learn. Was that your only symptom in the beginning, or were there others too? It was my only symptom, and at the time they just said, \u201cmaybe Valley Fever\u201d, or no idea.  It was actually called FUO...fever of unknown origin.  The next year, my husband was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and he had BAD pain for years.  A few years after that, I got my diagnosis of MCTD, because I had a little joint pain, and decided to visit his rheumatologist, since he already had the relationship.  That probably cut years off my diagnosis.  I did not have significant symptoms during my first flares, but at the time, was losing my esophageal motility, which was not found for about a decade.  That is why I suggested other doctors.  I forgot to add gastro doc to the list. I have found, unfortunately, that most rheumatologists are concerned about the kidneys (nephrology) instead of the whole system.  That is why I recommend a visit to a major medical center, where you can have several specialist coordinate your treatment Thank you. I have had an ultrasound of my stomach and everything is fine there. Luckly I do not have any other painful symptoms for now other than a headache. I hope it stays that way. The headache alone is too much. I cannot imagine having other pains too. &gt;From what I see, people with MCTD usually have very different symtoms than me so I am not even sure MCTD is my problem.\n\nIt could be that your doctor has not decided this is definitely what you have so it is in your notes because it is what she suspects at the moment. Diagnosis can take a long time with autoimmune disorders. \nTry not to compare yourself to other people too much; it is a rare condition and we are all different. Thank you :) If you are having headaches and stomach problems, check out abdominal migraines.  And the esophageal test is different from the stomach ultrasound. No stomach issues, only headache.

I have had the worst reaction to the vaccine, and I should state I am a big pro-vaccination person and would not discourage anyone to not get it. All of my friends and family have had theirs with zero reaction. \n\n2 hours after I got my first Pfizer shot I started to get hives and welts all over my body. I have never itched so badly. The welts were huge and covered 80% of my body. My hands and feet swelled up and my joints were all red and very swollen. My temp hit 101.9 at it is highest. \n\nI have been to 3 different docs and the ER and no one really knows what to do. It is really really bad and I am so uncomfortable. They have started me on prednisone and allergy meds. Today I woke up with less hives but still so itchy all over (like itch you cannot stop itching) and a very sore and tight throat. My vision is blurry and I am seeing trails. \n\nI have been in remission for 13 years. \n\nI do not want to discourage anyone to not get the vaccine but I am curious if anyone else has had a similar reaction. I had the first pfizer vaccine 4 days ago, and it is been rough. I have been achey all over (like normal but much worse) and very lethargic.  Almost certainly worth it, of course. I had the weirdest response ever. I actually felt a lot better after my first shot. For several days I felt amazing in terms of my MCTD symptoms. The second shot was neither good nor bad for me. I heard a tip that you should helicopter your arm that you received the shot  immediately after receiving it, and I tried that. I am not sure if it helped or what, but I did not even have the arm pain people talk about. Same here! I had the j&amp;j shot. I have no idea how protected I am at this point, shot was done march 30. I got very fatigued, feverish, achy all over for a day or two. Felt like my arm took a punch, about like tdap shots and flu shots do. I had both shots. Felt fine after the first, and exhausted for a couple days after the second one, but this seemed to be common among my friends without mctd as well!

This is going to be a lengthy post so before I go too far into detail I would like to provide some context on my situation so maybe I do not waste everyone is time If most of you cant relate. I have POTS (more like general dysautonomia as I deal with way more issues than a rising heart rate) and recently In July and last month I tested positive for MCTD. I had a positive ANA and RNP Antibodies. I am a 27 year old male who began having issues on July 16th, 2018. I was a very high functioning and high achieving adult. Worked as a Correctional Officer in a max security federal prison as well as power lifted in my spare time. Always walked 20k steps per day, my power lifting numbers were really great and then on July 16th, 2018 everything just stopped on a dime. Previous to that day, I had dealt with some aches and pains, heartburn, some migraines but nothing really out of the ordinary. But on July 16th, I had an episode of lightheadedness and some burning in my face and arm and ended up in the ER. That tipped off what has been a 40 month goose chase on what in the world is going on with me. I was shortly diagnosed with POTS but I knew that was not the whole picture, blood pressure fluctuation, Bradycardia, tachycardia, My right hip hurt me for 14 months straight, my chest was so sore that I could not lie on my stomach or press on my chest, My ears will randomly get blood red and firey hot every now and then, I have so many stomach issues now, I have trouble swallowing, and now my \"Pots\" has gotten so bad that I cant stand for longer than 10-20 minutes.. Cant drive, Cannot shower and I was medically retired from my job. X-rays, MRI's, CT's, Blood work... it was all normal. Until this July I finally tested positive on an ANA and RNP antibodies. I really felt that this was autoimmune all along.. I have no idea why it took 3 years to become positive but it did.. My family has a history of Raynaud's and lupus. I feel that MCTD or Autoimmunity in general is to blame for my dysautonomia. I am scheduled to see a rheumatologist next month but in the mean time the cardiologist I was working with has scheduled me for a pacemaker next week. I feel like I finally know what is going on with me and now I am second guessing the pacemaker. I really want to try some steroid treatment and IVIG if possible to see if my dysautonomia symptoms get better. This may be a shot in the dark but is there anyone here that has had success with IVIG? or anyone that has had POTS from MCTD? I am just trying to make an educated decision before I bring all this up to my cardiologist. Thank you in advance for any suggestions or information. I have ehlers danlos and POTS as well. These often happen as a cluster with autoimmune disorders and I have seen some studies about a genetic link. I have not tried IVIG but my symptoms include dysautonomia, joint pain and neuropathy too.I am taking plaquenil right now and while it took a while it did start helping with some symptoms like fatigue. Your as old as a family member of mine who had a heart attack. Out almost a half hour before they got a beat back. You can have more than 1 issue and MCTD can effect the heart.

Any suggestions on supplements? My suggestion for supplements is whatever your medical team advises you to take based on your lab results (for malabsorption issues showing deficiencies) and their experiences with autoimmune patients. It is not a good idea to take vitamins, supplements and minerals without their counsel, as they can interfere with your other medications and even cause organ damage. \n\nAs far as pain in the same spot, I still have right thumb arthritis due to primary RA. Lost my medical team when I lost my job 7 months ago but thanks for your input Have you tried an AI diet? Never heard of it. But I will  do some research  thank you At least take glucosamine and Coq-10, magnesium, vitamin d, Coq-10 has numerous drug interactions, especially for those of us on Mobic or other blood thinners and MOST especially for those on Diabetes meds. \n\nThere is no \"at least\" - you REALLY have to talk to your medical team to see what supplements are safe for you to take. Supplements can interfere with your medications and cause organ damage. Vit D is pretty integral, most of the population is severely deficient. It is a fat soluble vitamin and the max dose recommend is 4000iu unless otherwise prescribed by a doctor (if you are very low they will prescribe these giant horsepills of like 50,000iu)\n\nVit D can influence how tired you feel and cause muscle pain and weakness as well as bone issues and hair loss. Thank you when I work 3rd shift my vitamin d is always low I have had to take the prescription vitamin d several times I heard being in sunlight help so even when it is cold outside if the sun's out I go sit in my car heck I will try anything thank you so much Lots of autoimmune patients are vitamin d deficient so I would definitely recommend that. Even on prescription vitamin d, it is a struggle to keep mine at normal levels.  \n\nGlucosamine has definitely made a difference to my joints. It does not stop the pain, but it does make moving easier. \n\nI have just started taking folic acid to see if that helps with the hair I have lost. Oh no I am so sorry so far mine has not been effected. I take glucosamine with D but honestly I cannot tell a difference 7 months ago my job I could I was up and down up and down over 15 30 minutes so that worked but now I just shuffle around the house and to the deck to the flowers  any chore but have to take lots of breaks. I really honestly want to go back to work I just cannot find anything that I can stand up or sit down because I can only do each for 15 minutes maybe sitting 30 if I am lucky but I have to stand up because of the stiffness and the joint pains.

White blood cells being high generally means fighting an infection or high stress.\n\n\u201cThe low levels of circulating red blood cells (anemia) and a reduction in the white blood cell count (leukopenia) occur in 30 to 40 percent of cases.\u201d (Rarediseases.org)\n\nHigh platelets also point to infection.\n\n High red cells, high white cells, and high platelets are important symptoms of cancer (specifically kidney issues). Please talk to your doctor about your results asap. I have had kidney issues for a few years. But last 4 years all of a sudden I have had some horrible symptoms. Seems like I am sick every 2 months with low grade fever, and horrible flu like fatigue. He just did the bloodwork and it came back with these autoimmune markers. Maybe 2 separate issues?? It could be two separate issues but it could also be completely related. Part of mctd is systemic lupus and systemic lupus loves to screw with kidneys. Are you on any medication yet? First I would like to say I really appreciate the help and support right now. I just got the diagnosis and my appointment is tomorrow to discuss treatment options. As of now I am only on prednisone 10 mg daily for this issue. I will update tomorrow as to what he wants to do. Any first thoughts on treatment? I know different things work for different people.. \nIF it is the same issue, why would most people have low levels vs. High levels of RBC\u2019s, WBC\u2019s, etc. I guess if people have no kidney involvement? I am trying to answer my own questions.. lol. Anyhow, all help is appreciated! Correct! :) different treatment response for different organ involvement. I have no kidney issues and most of my symptoms are related to joints/tendons/muscle and a butterfly rash on my face. I am only on hydroxychloroquine since October 2019. I did several rounds of prednisone (and love it) but its not a good medicine for long term use and effects your immune system as well as your adrenal glands so when they tell you to taper off make sure you follow instruction:) I have no taper. He just gave me 20 days of 10 mg I would do a taper even if it is just dropping down to 5mg for a few days before stopping. 20 days is long enough that you should probably taper, though 10mg is low enough that the taper does not need to be that long. Otherwise without a taper your body might not like stopping abruptly and you may feel shitty again. Basically when you take prednisone your body will sort of shut off your adrenal glands and then when you stop taking it quickly your body kind of freaks out because everything is shut down and it was not prepared. Some people have accidentally given themselves Addison\u2019s disease that way. You could call the dr and double check if there is supposed to be a taper period. I accidentally gave myself the beginnings of an addisonian crisis once lol now I always taper! You might also need to be on it longer than 20 days too and will not know until you get to the end of your script. It took me 7 months to get off it when I started treatment because of my symptoms and it took a long time for my hydroxychloroquine to really kick in. Even still, I have had to go back on it several times.\n\n\u201cSecondary adrenal insufficiency is most commonly caused by medications, such as prednisone, intra-articular injections with steroids, or steroid creams. In this situation, the adrenal glands may take days to months to recover function and restore proper cortisol production.Apr 23, 2019\n \u203a ...\nMayo Clinic Q and A: Understanding adrenal insufficiency\u201d Thanks for the advice. I have a doc appointment for second opinion Saturday so I will discuss steroids at that time. I appreciate it Im on day 3 of my prednisone and I feel fabulous. Haha. God I missed them. Sigh \ud83d\ude14 they are the only thing that make me feel human again. I am still on prednisone.. no difference in symptoms.. \ud83e\udd28 It affects everyone differently but it could be you need a higher dose to feel better? I am taking 20mg for a week then 15 then 10 then 5. I am sure by the time I am down to 5 my internal voice is going to be panicking and my pain will be creeping back lol. After that she is putting me on something called sulfasalazine to try since the meloxicam did not do jack diddly for me. I was marveling last night how amazing it was that I could get out of my chair, go up stairs and nothing hurt, I even shaved my legs in the shower \ud83e\udd2a Gettin all crazy up in here! That is amazing! Glad something worked for you! I hope it works long term! That would be great! I am actually on lots of different meds for pain! Problem is they work very little. I have gone through trying about 150 over the 20 years I have been sick. It is great if you find something that works!", "My fatigue has been getting worse lately So for the last 5 years I have been on Hydroxycloroquine. But now my fatigue has become life hindering again. I barely have energy to even do my office job. So I was thinking of asking my rheumatologist to up my dose. But I am scared. \nHow high are your doses? And how often? \n\nI take 200mg twice a day I am sorry your fatigue has been getting worse, that shit can impede life so quick. I take about half the dose of hydroxychloroquine you do, but I also take mycophenylate as well. Mycophenylate has a bit more possible side effects, but I personally have not had many. Maybe it is time to up your dosage of hydroxy, or maybe add another med. I understand being scared, but your rheumatologist will help you balance out the side effects. Good luck! The dosage depends on your size. I am 5'5\" and 130# and I am on 300mg a day. I bumped up this summer when I was struggling with severe fatigue. I got better, but I was having more side effects. So I am seeing how I do back at 200mg. I am now fairly convinced it was not a progression of my MCTD.\n\nJust out of curiosity, have you had COVID or any other infection? COVID long-haul syndrome is a thing, and most people complain of severe fatigue. I am still not convinced I did not have COVID long-haulers over the spring and summer. I am back to my \"normal\", which is more episodic fatigue instead of daily, non-stop, do not have the energy to make breakfast or do much of anything else kind of fatigue. Other viral and bacterial infections can cause a similar syndrome. Especially Lyme disease. \n\nAlso, have you had your vitamin D3 or B12 levels checked lately? They might also offer some insight, because you will feel awful if those are low. I am sure they checked a CBC, but anemia is also something common we deal with. \n\nAlso, though it seems counter-intuitive, exercise can really help, if you are not already doing it regularly. Especially since you are doing office work. Getting up and moving around for 5-10 minutes throughout the day might go a long way to ward off the fatigue that comes just from sitting.\n\nI would recommend ruling out other causes before going higher on HCQ, unless you are pretty big already. The effects on the eyes are real, and my ophthalmologist is adamant about keeping the dose as low as possible. And I would not get on something stronger unless you know it is progression of the MCTD. Wow thank you! That was very helpful. Definitely scared to go higher. I just didnt know what else it could be. I havent gone to see a doctor for anything in a couple of months so maybe it is my vitamins out of whack. \n\nAlso no covid, my job makes us get tested pretty regularly so I know I am negative \n\nAnd I am 5'4 136lbs.... is 400mg way too much? I never questioned my doctor on it, but should I have? I was just glad to get my daily symptoms like arthritis and massice amounts of hairloss under control Since you are about my size, I would say your dose is too high. I was told by my ophthalmologist that 300 is as high as I can safely go. You might double-check with yours to make sure. He had a special formula that he used to get my highest dosage. I would been on 400mg when I was first diagnosed and he took me down at that time because it was too high.\n\nI would see about getting more blood work done then to check for all your levels to see if you can find something out. Another thought is to check thyroid function. Hashimoto's is common in lupus/MCTD, so if you have not been checked lately, that is another option.", "Nervous about taking Plaquinil I have been diagnosed with mild mixed connective tissue disease. My only symptoms are hair/eyebrow loss and burning, as well as fatigue. \n\nWBC - low\nC4 - low\nENA - slight positive 1.6 (&lt;1) RNP antibodies \n\nMy rheum wants to try 300mg of plaquinil per day. \n\nIm VERY nervous about this, as I know hair loss and eye issues can be side effects. I can not take anymore hair loss and I am an artist and make my living with my eyes.\n\nCan anyone share their experiences? What am I in for and how big of a deal are immunosuppressants? 1.  I was also nervous about starting.  I was on it for years\u2026no side effects except sun sensitivity. \n2.  I am off it now,  because my flares are gone \n3.  Plaquenil has a long, safe history \n4.  For burning, see your optometrist.  If your eyes are dry, there are several simple treatments. Thank you, this made me feel a lot better. Congrats on being able to get off meds! I did not know that could happen! Do people often go into remission and discontinue meds? \n\nUnfortunately I am already on another medication that causes sun sensitivity lol, so I am a bit worried about that. \n\nOne clarification: When you say if there is burning to  see optometrist, do you mean eye burning? Or the scalp and eyebrow burning I mentioned? (I have already seen a dermatologist) So sorry, I did not read that part very well! I meant eyelid burning (demodex follicularum caused), and dry eye (from Sjogrens), for which I use Pilocarpine. Over the years I have seen it go both ways.  I cling to the original thought behind what used to be called \u201cSharp\u2019s Syndrome\u201d\u2026.that  MCTD alone is not as bad as many of the individual autoimmune diseases.  \n\nYes, stay out of the sun.  I gave up kayaking and canoeing. Thank you for posting this. My rheumatologist prescribed plaquenil and it is been sitting on my bathroom counter for over a month. I battle daily headaches, fatigue, joint pain and anxiety from dealing with those things. I have read that plaquenil commonly causes headaches and worsens anxiety and that scares the bejeebers out of me. I have been on plaquinil for about 7 years with no side effects. I had a little nausea the 1st couple months I was on it so I would take it at night. As for the hair loss from the disease as well as the medications I started using  a biotin shampoo and conditioner and that really helped. I cannot speak for the hair loss - but for the eye issues, you will likely get regular/yearly check ups.\n\nTalk to your rheum/eye doctor about your worries. Maybe you can get automatically arranged eye doctor appointments?\n\nHowever, afaik (consult other sources on this), the retina issues are fortunately very rare. The more common cornea issues are reversible.\n\nPlaquenil is only an immunomodulant. Immunosuppressors typically have more side effects. But you will be monitored when you start both! Ask your rheum to explain.\n\nIt gets easier to take meds once you have started and accepted it is now your daily ritual... (sounds bad but it was like that when I had to start taking L-thyroxin for Hashimoto's) It is been a godsend for me. No side effects at all, just improvements in every area. That is so awesome, congrats and thank you for sharing :) I have also had no side effects from plaquenil at all.", "Poll for the community: What is your gender? MCTD studies have shown that there is about a 10:1 (F:M) ratio among those diagnosed in all ethnic groups. Let us see what our r/MCTD gender ratio is...\n\n( So far 5:1 female! Interesting. I am too late for the poll, but I am male.", "Current meds and their effectiveness on your overall condition Trying to get an idea of which meds are currently being prescribed, for which symptom and their impact on your overall condition.\n\nThis is the ones I take:\n\nPlaquenil - stopped it once for a couple of weeks as a test(do NOT do this), my body froze all functions lol. I am able to laugh in life because of plaquenil, God bless the one who invented it.\n\nOmeprazole - to stop my stomach try to throw acid on my face. Have stocked a years supply from costco.\n\nCellcept - to stop my immune cells from drawing a honeycomb graffiti inside my lungs using a sharpie\n\nThyroid meds - it was for a gentle autoimmune cousin gifted alongside mctd.

Plaquenil to suppress my immune system and stop the joint pain\nPrednisone for flare ups \nVitamin D \n\nHave been diagnosed for 14 months \n\nVery important you never stop your plaquenil unless the side effects are too much at which point you immediately tell your rheumatologist and try something else. There was a man a while back in the Lupus reddit who stopped his when he felt better and his body attacked his kidneys. Within 3 months he went from okay to stage 4 renal failure and needed a transplant.\nJust because you feel better does not mean it is okay to stop. If you stop, you will cause a flare and be screwed and not know until possibly too late, or have to go through the long haul of taking your meds again while waiting on them to build and kick in. Pilocarpine which gives me saliva and tears, and overall moisture.  \n\nOmeprazole...I have been on it since the 90\u2019s.\n\nLexapro, to calm my anxieties and let my body heal Orencia- every 3x infusion at the hospital\u2014 works amazing\u2014 I also get a tiny dose of steroids with that as a pre med. \n\namlodipine- mctd is attacking my kidneys causing heart problems so this regulates bp \n\nZofran/promethazine- omg-- anti-nausea LIFESAVERS.

I was diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria in 08/19 and was eventually referred to see a rheumatologist in 2020. Prior to my appointment, my hives resolved and levels decreased but I went ahead with my rheumatologist appointment.\n\nI had labs done that show I had a 1:80 positive ANA, anti sm-Rnp of 3.0 and RNP of 1.1, which is connected to MCTD.\n\nI met with my rheumatologist who said since I have no symptoms as of now the best thing to do is monitor me every few months.

My doctor has told me it most likely has something to do with my MCTD and that I am prone to it happening again in other joints. \n\nApparently Kienbock\u2019s is a rare disease but since it is connected to my MCTD, is there anyone else that is had this or something similar?", "Has anyone had pulmonary hypertension or high blood pressure since diagnosed? I was diagnosed with mctd in July and was prescribed Plaquenil. Was on it from the end of July till mid September. At first I did not notice any side affects but mid August/Sept I kept chest pains. I went to multiple doctor appointments and blood pressure was high (140/90ish and 150/90ish). Again was taken off Plaquenil but still having chest pains. Have not had my blood pressure taken since stopping medication. I go to my rheumatologist tomorrow. After looking at articles online I see pulmonary hypertension being linked to mctd. Has anyone experienced this? Any advice going to the doctor tomorrow since I am just recently diagnosed. Thanks. I have not experienced it but I have heard that it is a common complication with covid patients who have been given plaquenil.\nI think you need to ask your rheumatologist to investigate whether this is a direct result of taking plaquenil or if you have an underlying condition that is causing high blood pressure.\n\nHave you had a history of high blood pressure or is this a new issue? I have had a history of it. I am overweight. 5 or so years ago I did take blood pressure medication but I lost 60 pounds and got it under control and it is been fine since. But then either taking the Plaquenil or the mctd has raised it again. Get a blood pressure monitoring machine of Amazon they are not that expensive. Take measurements twice a day morning after you wake up and night before you sleep. Many factors can cause a spike in BP stress, anxiety, even pain can.\n\nPoint being maintain a journal and see if your readings are consistently high, cause usually just one of two high readings do not mean much as we do not know the factors influencing your BP. But if constantly your BP is high even in a relaxed state of mind then surely there is an underlying cause.\n\nEither way tell your doc about it, the doc might know what scans could be done to eliminate any serious cause. Yes I have had my thyroid checked and the tests always come back fine even though my mother had thyroid cancer so there is issues there. And yes I am going to order a bp monitor today. Thanks. This stuff (e.g. pulmonary hypertension) tends to be caused by MCTD itself, independent of medication.  Do a search for \"mixed connective tissue disease pulmonary hypertension\" on scholar.google.com. Amlodipine lowered my blood pressure effectively Okay thank you.", "advice for getting tested for mctd Hey everyone, I just wanted to reach out and see if you guys had any opinions on if I should bring up this discussion to my doctor at my next visit. My mom has mctd so we have talked about it a lot because her and I have some of the same issues. \n\nI am 27 and the last few years especially I have been dealing with pretty bad joint pain (some days worse than others and some days I have none at all) that seems like RA but I have not noticed any visible swelling or redness. I also have periods where my fingers and especially my toes are FRIGID but there is no obvious color change like there is with Raynaud\u2019s, where my mom\u2019s is pretty prominent. I feel like I am tired all the time. Idk just random stuff like that but I am worried that because I am an RN that works 12 hour shifts in the hospital it will be brushed off due to my job and being on my feet so much. I understand some pain is expected w the job but I get it on my days off too and even when I am working it seems like it should not be this bad for my age .. on bad days I have come home and cried because I am in so much pain. \n\nI guess I am just looking to see if anyone else had these  kind of in-between, semi-symptoms and had issues with their doctors following up on their concerns and taking them seriously or not. \n\nThanks in advance! Yes. Yes and yes. Get the tests.  You, as a nurse, probably have an idea of who is a trust rheumy in your area. My primary care doc is pretty young but I have only seen him once so far and it was just for a brief physical for work or something (my normal guy just retired) so I hope he would be open to it. As far as rheumatologists go, my mom loves hers so I would probably look into going there as well if needed. I was diagnosed in my late 30\u2019s, but the damage happened earlier.  I would recommend getting on this ASAP. I am not due to see him until June but with covid I probably will not be able to get in sooner, but your case sounds similar to my mom\u2019s.. she was diagnosed later on when it still was not really a fully understood condition and fought for years to figure out what was happening so I am trying to avoid that if possible. I will definitely pick his brain about it when I see him though. Thanks! Happy to help.  I am 72, and am doing pretty well, but I would love to help when I can n Ask for the tests! Keep a symptom journal so your doctor can see what you are going through on a day to day basis. I use Bearable (r/BearableApp) but there are lots of different apps to choose from or you could just keep written notes in a notebook. oh good idea! i will check it out for sure and then maybe i will do that until my appointment since it is not until june That should provide them with a really detailed view of how you are doing. Fingers crossed it helps!", "Going to see a specialist to rule out if I have mctd. Anything I should ask or bring up during the appointment? I am going to be telling them my symptoms and how long I have been experiencing xyz for. Besides that, \nI want to make the most out of my appointment. Is there anything else I should ask or say? Make sure any prior tests or other exam records are sent over for the Dr to review ahead of time. I.e. have you seen  gastroenterology, cardiology, pain management, notes from your GP, lab tests. The more information the Dr has the better. Also write down your symptoms so you have it. It is easy to forget something at the appointment. Good luck! One thing to add, if something is affecting your ability to work- mention it. For example my hands hurt so much it affected my typing (and I code, which is not great with voice to type). Sometimes I feel like they do not take action unless they hear that level of impact. I had mentioned it before, but they just told me to use OTC meds. And find out if there are connective tissue diseases or autoimmune diseases in your family history Same! My hands, especially my right, is so painful and swells up, and I type for work which makes it that much more difficult. Be sure they are doing the right tests. Check for specific antibodies like RNP &amp; ANA. That seems like it should be obvious, but drs will try all other tests before that one.  So to save yourself another trip and more tests be sure they are looking for that. I have similar problems with my hands as well. I do plan on bringing that up. It is frustrating. The amount of things I can I do with my hands changes each day. Sometimes I can do a lot, other times not so much. Higher priority tasks take up most of it. It sucks because some of my hobbies require my hands and I have not been able to do much of it", "Update - Got blood tests, not found much, what now? A few weeks ago I asked you guys and gals for some advice on what tests to get done and got a lot of good advice.\n\nBrief recap, I have been on the waiting list to see a rheumatologist for over a year, unlikely to see them anytime soon as I am not deemed particularly urgent so was getting tests done through my GP in the meantime. My symptoms include abnormal vascular system including numerous veins not functioning, gastroparesis and reflux, chronic pain and fatigue, migraines, heat sensitivity, swollen hands and feet, hair loss on lower legs and a few other weird things.\n\nMy results came back recently and taking a look, nothing really stands out.\n\nANA, ENA, ds-DNA, RH, CCP etc all came back showing nothing notable. Only thing that did stand out was mild lymphocytosis which I am not overly surprised by given I think I had a viral infection not that long before the blood tests.\n\nSo, any advice on what I could try next or other avenues to look at? I plan on following up with my GP soon but would like to go in with a plan. I know something is wrong with me, but I worry the doctor will give up looking if I do not keep pushing. I think your best bet is trying to push for a rheumatology appointment. Phone the hospital or clinic and tell them you would be willing to take any cancelled appointments they have at short notice if it  means you are more likely to be seen.\n\nIt may be worth asking for a referral to a chronic fatigue team, if you have one in your area. They cannot diagnose you but they will help you manage the fatigue side of things which should improve your quality of life. Thanks for the kind response :) That does sound like the most sensible approach if I am going to get to the bottom of it. Oddly I never knew there was such a thing as a chronic fatigue team but I will do some research about what is in my area. What is \u201can abnormal vascular system\u201d? I have never heard someone list veins not functioning as a symptom and I am just super curious what you mean by that! Sorry if it is not clear or a bit hard to explain. I will do my best but I do not fully understand it myself.  I went in for surgery as I was having issues with varicose veins and a varicocele, this despite at the time being a relatively fit guy in his 30s. While performing that surgery they discovered my Inferior Vena Cava did not work at all, likely never did. Some of my other veins such as those around my kidneys seem to not work either. \n\nWith some of these main roads shut down, my blood has had to get around on backroads, but it looks like it is been a bit too much for them and as a result many of my veins are very tortuous and bit of a mess from having excess pressure places on them. I also think I have some level of vascular inflammation as a lot of the pain in my veins I was experiencing does seem to be improved to a degree by an elimination diet. My blood vessels tend to burst very easily at times too, carrying even a very light backpack will leave me with stripes of red visible blood vessels on my shoulders where the straps were which does not seem to happen to anyone else I know. Is there a diagnosis code for something like this? If your doctor did not note it in your chart, then maybe go back to them (if they are a vein specialist) and see if they recommend any scans to check on that vein. Did you check c3 and c4? If that is also good i think you should search for causes that are not autoimmune", "Need help determining these thyroid function test Hey, trying to figure out these results.

Quick question, is it normal for your Ana to come back negative from using Hydroxychloroquine and Prednisone? Would it mean the medicine is working despite me still feeling a bit in pain? Some of my symptoms went away but some are still here. Have included test from June and August!  Background info: I have been diagnosed with UCTD with symptoms leaning towards Lupus and RA.  Ana can fluctuate with testing labs and for unknown reasons throughout your life. It does not really mean much in terms of disease progression or treatment. After the 1st positive, they usually rely on other test results. Ana is kind of just a gateway for docs to justify further testing. Mixed connective tissue diseases are tricky anyhow, as it is more about the symptoms than test results. As long as your current treatments are helping, that is what matters. Good luck to you. I mean false negatives can and do happen, just like false positives! But definitely a conversation to have with your rheum! My rheumatologist told me ANA is not a very reliable test as labs use different methods. He said if he drew my blood and sent it to 5 labs the results would all be different. He said if he drew more blood a week later and sent it to the same 5 labs it would be different than the previous week. He said the other rheumatology tests and symptoms are more reliable. It could be. My ANA started coming back negative after I started immunosuppressants. If you were borderline to begin with maybe it is just that the medications are causing those markers to be undetectable now.\n\nHowever, ANA is not a good indicator of ongoing disease or inflammation. Most doctors care more about stuff like CRP or complement levels. If those are showing less inflammation that would be a better thing to focus on. It can fluctuate. Mine goes up and down. It can be normal despite the fact I feel like death warmed up. I have Lupus and RA and my ANA goes back and forth. I can be really ill and it will be negative and not in a flare and it will be positive again.  I think the medications have something to do with it.", "Poll for the Community: Has anyone looked into or had tested, their hormone levels?

I am curious if anyone here has had their hormones checked, if they have had imbalances, and/or they have attempted to stabilize their levels.\n\n( Just to clarify: You are speaking of sexual hormones, right?\n\nThere are a whole lot of other hormones (like thyroid hormones) that can be super relevant but you really mean stuff like estrogens and gestagens? Is this a thing that both men and women should do?  \n\nRelatedly, I think men, because they often present differently (especially in terms of mental health symptoms), are probably under diagnosed for this and other autoimmune disorders. Other: thyroid hormones were off when I was 18, but have been in check the last 16 years. Well actually, I believe balancing all hormones is necessary. Hormones like cortisol and serotonin are extremely important, not only to balance our fight or flight responses but also an imbalance there can lead to imbalances in other hormones (which is why stress can exacerbate a lot of illnesses). Sex hormones are also very important and a good place to start when checking for imbalances. Sex hormones play a much larger role in our body than the very complicated role they are known for (gender, pregnancy, etc.). Sex hormones (as well as others) are closely linked to your immune system and based on my research they say that an imbalance in hormones can trigger dormant autoimmune illnesses. People who are predisposed to (have family history of) autoimmune illness should definitely keep an eye on them... Years ago when I was taking risperidone having being given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. It screwed up my hormone levels massively and put into an early menopause at 21.\nA few years later, another doctor told me that my diagnosis was cyclothymia (think of it as being at the bottom end of the bipolar spectrum) and that I never should have been put on that medication. Not that I am bitter at all... \n\nI currently take Cerazette so I have no idea what my hormone levels are like, but I know that dealing with a flare without being on birth control would make it even more miserable. I get my thyroid tested every 6 months (since I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 8 or 9 years ago, it is usually fine), and for the past 3 years I have been getting my sex hormones tested with that because of unexplained menstrual irregularities that I have been having most of my life and new symptoms of possible dysfunction, but the tests come back normal every time. That is super interesting. I am sorry to hear that you were misdiagnosed and that it caused so much pain. Out of curiosity, have your doctors ever looked into PANDAS as a potential cause for your mood disorder? I am currently looking into it for not only my MCTD symptoms but also for my anxiety disorder that I developed at 10 years old. Curious if you have looked into it. This is what I keep running into. Irregularities with normal results. However, I looked into my results and what my doctor said was \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d might be a real issue. Still looking though Absolutely agree. And yes! Hormones dictate the seamless inner works of men just as much as women. Women do have major fluctuations that occur during their life time that may be why more women have autoimmune than men but men, as we know, go through a major hormone fluctuation during puberty and again in their twenties which may be a factor in autoimmune setting in. I am not an expert but there is a lot of information on pubmed about the role of hormones in autoimmune for both men and women. I am not saying this is the cause of everyone is illness but it may certainly hold our bodies back from figuring out how to correct themselves. A couple of doctors thought I had PCOS. I did the ultrasound to look for cysts and had none, but like 1/3 of PCOS patients do not have any??? Anyway, I was treated for it nonetheless by being prescribed metformin, and for a reason I cannot remember a later doctor increased my dose, but then I started having major hypoglycemic episodes because metformin is primarily a diabetes medication. Point is, no PCOS. I would also been given birth control since my period started getting irregular without doctors really trying to figure out why. Just \"lol it be like that sometimes.\" True, it may just be like that sometimes, but with everything else going on I suspect it is trying to tell me something. I am off BC for the first time in years now so we will just see what fun symptoms start up.\n\nMystery illnesses are some BS. I have learned over time that doctors tend to treat symptoms not underlying illness. That is why I have found it a nice balance to continue care with my doctors but also have them work with my functional medicine doctor who is more concerned with why your body is not performing properly in the first place. Thank you. At the time it was a horrible experience but I have learned a lot from it and it is made me more sympathetic and understanding of other people's mental health, so maybe, in some weird way, I benefitted from it. \nNo, to the best of my knowledge, no one has looked into PANDAS. I do not think PANDAS fits me, whereas my current diagnosis or cyclothymia does. There is a history of bipolar and major depressive disorder in my family, so I think it is more likely to be that. My understanding is that PANDAS comes out of the blue and is generally pediatric.\nI have had strep but I think I was around 30 when it happened and while I do have OCD, I do not have the tics.\nGood luck looking into it, it sounds like a horrible thing to live with so while it may give you answers, I will keep my fingers crossed that you do not have it. Thank you, and thanks for sharing your experience. You are probably right that in your case it does not fit. Especially if you have a strong family history of your symptoms. And to your point, I think that all the struggles we face are meant to teach us something. It sounds like you have a positive outlook so I am glad to have your input. I could not agree more, I am a firm believer in our struggles teaching us something. I do not know whether it is meant to be, but I believe we have to make the best out of a crappy situation.\nMaking the decision to do that was a real turning point for me. I hate having CFS/fibro in my medical history because doctors are so dismissive of those conditions, but I would not have this kind of outlook without my fabulous CFS nurse. Quick reminder that that \"functional medicine\" is no legitimate evidence based branch of medicine.\n\nIt is okay, though, like with everything non-evidence based, to view it like an addition on top of everything - like you describe it. It is someone who takes time and tries to help you.\n\nNothing - not even functional medicine - can really 100 % tell what is wrong with us. It is hard to accept, but with rare and autoimmune diseases, research and diagnostics are just not there yet.", "How long does plaquenil take to kick in? I been on leflunomide and recently taken off it and they started me with plaquenil.\nI have been getting a headache and my joint pain came back. I feel like leflunomide helped me almost immediately but now took a step back with plaquenil any tips?", "Carpal tunnel? I actually have uctd which is suspected to be lupus and I have recently gotten a new symptom and it took me a long time to be able to put into words and through searching I found that it is a carpel tunnel symptom known as twanging and it is described here  like this:\n\n\u201cTwanging\n\nA surprising number of patients use this word to describe a sensation experienced in the hand for which there seems to be no entirely satisfactory technical medical term. It is a sudden, unpleasant, shock-like sensation in the palm and or fingers, or occasionally spreading into the forearm, usually precipitated by some movement of the hand. The analogy which patients seem to be making is that of plucking a tight string or suddenly releasing a rubber band. This symptom is described both by untreated and treated patients but seems to be especially noticeable after carpal tunnel surgery. It is relationship to carpal tunnel syndrome and exact cause are uncertain.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what I am experiencing and I was wondering if anyone else here has experienced this too? I do not know if it is carpal tunnel or my disease doing something to create a symptom of carpal tunnel or maybe the disease is causing carpal tunnel idk it is a very very strange feeling that makes me think \u2018oh no\u2019 every time it happens it just feels like something is wrong. If anyone can give me any insight into what might be happening I would appreciate it and it will help me when I talk to my dr about it, thank you It sounds like a pinched nerve.  Try wearing a wrist brace or splint at night.  If it helps, this will help your doctor with the diagnosis", "Meds What medications are you taking and why? \nI am just curious. \n\nI am on,\nhydroxychloroquine for over all wellness and inflammation. \nXeralto so I will not get blood clots. \nNifedipine for my raynauds. \nAzathioprine for overall well being and inflammation. \nFamotadine for acid reflux. \nThose are the ones I take daily. I also have pain killers and muscle relaxer to use in an as need basis. I also must give myself a b12 shot every month because my body cannot absorb that vitamin gastrointestinaly. \n\nI still struggle with accepting the fact that I need these meds to survive everyday. I was diagnosed in January of 2018 after a pulmonary embolism I had in December of 2017. A month after my 21st birthday. Lol happy birthday to me \ud83e\udd73. Over the last few years I have gotten better about accepting all of this but it is still hard for me. How do you deal? \n\nI wish you all a safe and happy holiday season! I am glad I have you guys to go to for support. Thank you all! I am on a really similar regimen, though the meds are slightly different:\n- Azathioprine\n- Hydroxychloroquine, \n- Sildenafil (Raynaud\u2019s),\n- Omeprazole (GERD),\n- Aspirin (clot prevention),\n- I also take oral B-12 due to recent mild deficiency\n\nI have had a lupus diagnosis for a long time ~13 years, though the first time a doctor brought it up was about 20 years ago (when I was about your age!) The MCTD diagnosis is more recent. I have had the luxury to gradually accept my diagnosis, because I had relatively mild symptoms for a long time, so even though I had the disease it did not affect my day-to-day life all that much. \n\nA couple of years ago I had a really bad flare of myositis where I could barely lift up my arms or walk. Since then, I have had to come to terms with the possibility that my life may be limited in ways I do not expect in the future, so I have taken it as an opportunity to focus on living the way I want to now. I quit a stressful leadership role in my job because it was not worth the anxiety. I spend as much time with my kids as possible. Basically I have Marie Kondo\u2019d my life - getting rid of anything that doesnt bring me joy. \n\nThese kinds of illnesses lay bare a fact that is true for everyone, even though it is easier for healthy people to ignore: nothing is guaranteed in life, and being a healthy, able-bodied, independent person is ALWAYS a temporary state. For some it lasts longer than others, but we should take whatever health we have and use it to the max, because you never know what tomorrow will bring. Thank you for sharing. I wish I could upvote this twice! \n\nI have only had a couple bad flares. And it was mostly joint pain and rashes. My dr said that there might come a day that I will not be able to get out of bed, and I am dreading that day. \nI try really hard not to live in fear of my health in the future but it is hard. I have made a few friends through forums like these with women who are twice my age and they have all told me that it is not always bad but at some point I will experience a horrible flare up. I also do not want to end up hospitalized ever again(I mean I am so no one wants that but it scared the fuck out of me! And I have already been through that twice). Hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day\n\nPrednisone for flare ups (not currently taking)\n\n81mg baby aspirin (anti clot)\n\nIron 65mg\n\nVitamin D 2000iu\n\nPrenate Mini Prenatals\n\nOral Lidocaine on my spine/joints if they are acting up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 33 weeks pregnant, was diagnosed with mctd october 2019. Started hydroxy and prednisone and in April got oopsie pregnant because the hydroxy and pred suppressed my immune system enough so my body stopped attacking any fertilized eggies. Woopsie. At the moment, I am only on hydroxychloroquine and naproxen (with omeprazole to prevent damage from the naproxen) for MCTD and a few other things for unrelated stuff. I also take glucosamine with added vitamin d for my joints. \n\nSo far, both my rheumatologist and my dermatologist have suggested steroids but I have refused because the idea of steroids as a diabetic with bipolar does not fill me with joy. \nMy rheumatologist is currently holding off prescribing anything for Raynaud's because I already have pretty crappy episodes of vertigo and he is worried that it will get worse. \n\nI speak to him again at the start of January and see my dermatologist for a skin biopsy in February, so things may well change then as I think I am at the point where I am going to have to cave in on the steroids. Hmmm you guys seem to be taking a less serious clot med than me. Wonder if I can get that changed. Also, how is pregnancy?? I was told that I should avoid pregnancy till I am in complete remission. I hate steroids!!! So much. I do not blame you. I have low blood pressure as it is and it took me quite a while to adjust to the meds. If I do t take them properly I will feel faint all day. It does help with the raynauds though. I have found that keeping my core temperature warm helps a lot. Hi! I am on hydroxychloroquine as well, half dose now since my retinas were showing freaky stuff. I am on a weekly self injection of Benlysta, which seems to have done a great job on my inflammation! \nI take prednisone when having a flare up. \nOther than that, I just take some vitamins - b12 cause I am vegan, d3, calcium, and iron. Is b12 deficiency a thing I should look into? I have moderate GI symptoms.  My heartburn all but disappeared after I stopped eating gluten and started eating high quality yogurt regularly. I have been trying to keep my core temperature warm, but I seem to have lost the inability to regulate my body temperature so I suddenly end up really hot, remove layers and end up back at square one.  It sounds like your entry into this diagnosis with a PE was pretty intense and scary. I do not know if you had any idea it was coming, but especially if it was a total surprise I can really understand having anxiety about the unknown. It is very unnerving to suddenly learn something is extremely wrong with your body, especially if you have always been healthy. I know I was really thrown when I discovered I had essentially no function anymore in my lower esophagus. I had no idea my body was attacking itself that way, so it made me wonder what else it was doing that I did not know about. Pulmonary hypertension? Interstitial lung disease. Those things can be subtle at first...and then they can kill you. Scary! \n\nLiving with uncertainty is one of the hardest things about life in general, and that is especially true if you have a wacky disease like this. There is a lot of wisdom out there in various spiritual disciplines as well as in mainstream psychology/psychotherapy. Also things like yoga and mindfulness to practice focusing your attention on the present, rather than a future we cannot control. If I were you I feel like I might have some PTSD from the PE experience, and would consider finding a therapist to talk about that experience and how it affected me. You are young enough that most of your peers probably have not had to deal with anything like this, which can feel super-isolating. Do not know if any of that resonates for you, but I have used combinations of all those things and have found them all helpful in their way. \n\nI know if can be hard to feel gratitude for this illness, but I have found that it has given me a lot of perspective over the years. Also many lessons about compassion, humility, and acceptance. In many ways it has made me a better person than I might have been otherwise. I wonder if it is because you have already had a blood clot? I have multiple risk factors, but have never actually had a clot, which is why my hematologist chose aspirin over one of the stronger anticoagulants. Hmmm havnt heard of benlysta. Thanks for sharing! I hate acid reflux. I cannot seem to find the perfect diet. The only thing I know for sure fucks me up is spicey, and acidic. But sometimes I will eat great for days and still get acid reflux. I feel like there is no rhyme or reason to it sometimes. Whoa... that is how I feel sometimes. Is that a thing?? Our bodies just stop regulating temperature properly? Every single thing you said resonates with me on the deepest level. You are absolutely correct about all of that. I had no idea what was coming at all. I feel extremely isolated, and none of my friends understand. All of my friends are hippies too, so they frown upon me taking meds and western medicine :/. I definitely have some ptsd from it. There is actual a spot in/on my back that physically holds trauma from it. My massage therapist and I were trying to work on it before covid hit. It is a lot of inner work too that is really difficult to do. I practice all of that stuff! I am actually a yoga teacher. And similarly to you, I have found a silver lining in this. I have started to teach restorative yoga to those who have similar illnesses like fibromyalgia. I figured if yoga helps me get through this it is got to help other too, right? \n\nThank you SO much for responding to this post. You have made me feel heard and seen. I appreciate that so much. Ahh ya! That is probably it!! you will be fine though. the people with no medical care paying for pseudo treatments such as yoga are really in danger &lt;3 \n\nHonestly, the fact that you resonate with my experience makes me feel heard and seen, too, so thank you. It is rare for me to meet someone with lupus, and I have never met anyone with MCTD in real life, so even just from your med list I feel a connection. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut also, I resonate with the isolation from peers you probably feel. I also happened to go through premature menopause in my mid-20s. (Unclear if autoimmune related.) It was well before my friends started thinking about having babies. It was so difficult to try to convey the sense of loss I felt for something that had not yet existed - and to people who had not yet thought about their fertility in any real sense. I was sitting there invisible through the hot-flash jokes my menopausal coworkers made around me, and also really isolated during so many casual menstruation conversations with my friends - and eventually, during their pregnancies and babies and various fertility struggles, too. So I know how jarring and difficult it is to be out of sync with your peers, and how important it is to find people who can help process these important and meaningful experiences. Bummer that you are dealing with all that!\n\nJust out of curiosity, were you on birth control at the time of your PE? Did they test you for antiphospholipid syndrome? Do you also have autoimmune gastrititis, is this why you have absorption issues?\n\nThere is a lot of acceptance that comes with all this. I am on too many meds to write down, but I have other things going on as well. MCTD is actually actually mild in comparison, and I only take HCQ daily for that with a back-up of steroids for flares. It is still gotten worse over time, and I may have to advance to something stronger eventually. I have antiphospholipid antibodies, along with Hashimoto's, that is often tied to lupus/MCTD. So I do take thyroid medication. I also deal with Chiari malformation, dysautonomia, cluster headaches, degenerative spine issues, and endometriosis. \n\nHopefully you will not develop other disorders, though autoimmunity often seems more like a cascade of issues than a single disease. You are still young enough that you might have hope for better options than we have now, and hopefully something that will at least stop the progression. If you follow COVID long-hauler syndrome at all, you will see a lot of similarities between disorders like MCTD and what many long-haulers are dealing with. If there is one bright spot about COVID, it is that it might help shed a lot on how the immune system gets out of whack and help motivate the research community to find a way to treat problems of the immune system better. A rheumatology nurse I saw said that it could be a kind of autonomic dysfunction. Apparently our bodies can get so overwhelmed by dealing with prolonged periods of pain/inflammation that it can cause weird quirks like that to happen. Wow. The body is a crazy thing. I will have to talk to my rhumi about that. Yes, that is what they initially thought it was, birth control. After many more tests we realized it was autoimmune. Yes, I have gastritis as well. \n\nWow! Thank you for sharing. You sound like a warrior. \n\nThat is exactly what I am hoping for too. \nThere is got to be some sort silver lining, right? \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\n\nI have never met anyone else in person with MCTD either. Have not even met someone with lupus. It is crazy because I am apart of the online community and it seems like it would be more common but it is really not. Thank goodness we live in the future and can use social media as a place to connect. \n\nPremature menopause?? Jeez.. I could only imagine. Drs tell me I should absolutely avoid pregnancy till I hit remission. That it can be extremely dangerous for the child and myself. Spooky. I am sorry you have gone through that. Again, thank you for sharing. \n\nIt is important we stick together!! I could not imagine doing this without this online community. One rheumatologist shrugged it off, the other one thinks it makes sense. My GP thinks it sounds plausible and cannot think of a better reason for my internal thermostat being broken. \nI would be interested what your rheumatologist thinks. I will ask her next month when I go in! If gluten is the culprit, it can take a few weeks to fully go away, and you have to cut most soy sauce, which usually has wheat as the third ingredient, and other random things.  There is probably no guarantee that it will work, but going gluten free is a reasonable thing to try. Could be. Eliminating food is so difficult to do. I have got to get more self discipline to do it. It is been hard enough staying away from spicey, citrus, and acidic stuff. Once I stopped eating gluten, my spice and acid tolerance went way up!  I make and eat about a pint of fresh salsa per week. There is a test they can do to tell if you have clotting issues. My rheumy tested me after I became pregnant to make sure I would not have issues with the baby. I want to say it had to do with testing my ss-a/ro antibodies but it was probably some associated test she took around the same time. Fortunately my numbers came back good enough that everything has been going well. I have stayed on my meds and did all the testing my rheumy wanted to do. The big scare was her and the maternal fetal group were talking about heart block in the babybso they did two verrrrry in depth fetal anatomy scans at 20 and 24 weeks to see. There was none and so far everything has somehow gone well. I am 35 weeks on Thursday so we are down to the last month here. The obgyn wants to pull baby at 39 weeks on recommendation from maternal fetal group, so I have a csection planned for jan 28. What I am most worried about is the potential flare up coming after surgery due to the surgical inflammation AND there is a high chance of flare after a pregnancy. But the good news is I have been medicated long enough now that I may not have the flare. Here is hoping. And yes, I was also told not to get pregnant, and went on nuvaring for a month but it made me sick and I took it out. My husband forgot his TRT medication so he was no longer sterile, but did not tell me because he forgot! So it was a pretty big oops. But not unwanted. Just scarier :) Oh, yeah, I remember taking one of those. That is definitely it.", "Please Help! My wife has MCTD and she is having trouble sleeping without tossing and turning at night due to pain in both shoulders. Are there any mattresses that might help ease her pain and let her get some halfway decent sleep at night?  Has she tried a muscle relaxer?  (Cheaper than a mattress).  Pain used to keep me awake.  I use either marijuana or xanax. This is probably going to be very unique to her personal preference. I used to sell mattresses and had extensive training, so I can do my best to help with a few tips.\n\nTypically, the lighter she is, the softer the mattress should be (within reason.) If she is super thin and does not weigh much, she will just rest on top of the mattress if it is too firm, which often results in tossing, turning, and unrefreshing sleep. The inverse is also true, meaning if she weighs a little more for her size it is better to get a slightly firmer mattress. \n\nThe recommended method for selecting a mattress is to go to the mattress store, identify a few that you are interested in, and lie on them for 10 minutes each in the position you will be sleeping in normally. Do not let the salesperson distract you, just let them know you will get back with them once you have tried several mattresses. \n\nSpring mattresses are better for people who get hot easily and need more airflow, but they can sometimes start to break down and develop uncomfortable spots where the spring pokes you. In my personal opinion, these are best avoided for people with chronic illness. Some spring mattresses are great or they can be tolerated with a high quality mattress topper, but in my experience with many mattress brands, it is kind of a roll of the dice whether it will develop painful spots. \n\nMemory foam is a material that holds a lot of heat and retains it, keeping the sleeper warmer. This can be good if you are always cold when you sleep, but bad for those that \u201csleep hot\u201d to start with. Less airflow due to the nature of the very dense material. The other thing about memory foam is that it molds to your body. Some people like this because of the \u201csink-in-ability\u201d but it can also keep you sort of locked in one position all night long, which for some can exacerbate chronic pain or other symptoms. \n\nNatural latex foam is a cooler material because it is manufactured with holes in the surface and it is naturally a more breathable material. This has a good amount of \u201cbounce\u201d and can be softer or firmer depending on how it is manufactured. I personally find this type of mattress to be best for me, but YMMV. Repositioning at night is easy and I find it does not exacerbate my chronic pain. These are also available as mattress toppers if the price of a natural latex mattress is prohibitive for your budget, as natural latex is quite pricey compared to other materials.\n\nThen there is artificial foam mattresses, I would rate these above memory foam or spring mattresses in terms of comfort for those with chronic pain, but they are going to retain more heat than the natural latex variety.\n\nThe last one that I actually do not know much about is the newer gel foam mattresses. These are typically brightly colored and they will show you a cutaway so you can see what is inside. I will leave it to other experts to tell you the benefits and drawbacks of this material, but in my honest opinion it seems like the latest fad or gimmick. \n\nHighly recommend going with a company that allows free returns if you decide it is not for you. There are lots of companies that are doing this now. Very very often, you need a couple of weeks to a full month of sleeping on the mattress to know if it is the right fit. Your body will naturally adjust to the new mattress, and you will very likely both get some aches and pains as your body gets used to it. This is normal, but if you are still uncomfortable/waking up extra sore after 3-6 weeks it is probably time to return it. \n\nMy favorite site for mattress reviews is ( They are not affiliated with any manufacturer or retailer, so the reviews are unbiased (at least as far as I can tell.) \n\nHope you all find a great mattress for you both. Best of luck! Wow!  Thank you so much for taking the time to compose that thoughtful and length response.  I had been researching Talalay Latex mattress toppers but was not sure that would be the best option.  But it sounds like I am headed in the right direction.  Unfortunately, the sleeplikethedead website only has one review for latex toppers.  I have posted to r/mattress for shopping/buying advice.  Thank you again for your helpful response.  We wish you the best! For sure, hope you guys have some good success from posting over there. Sometimes I forget there are so many amazingly specialized subreddits here. Pretty cool what Reddit has to offer :) Would it be worth looking into an orthopedic pillow? I am in the same position as your wife and having had success with a knee pillow, I think I am going to see if I can find a pillow that will protect my neck and shoulders before trying a new mattress. U-shaped pillow, usually purchased for pregnancy. It offers much better full body support for neck, back, shoulders, legs than the usual setup of flat pillows and mattress I have been using a big wedge pillow. Keeps my shoulders flat and propped up. I have been a life long tummy sleeper myself. And training myself to sleep on my back has been an undertaking, but is working, and my shoulders, wrists, and hands are much better. Good luck to her, missing sleep is truly it is own kind of hell! I use a layla mattress. it has a firm side and a soft side. The soft side is better for me but sometimes I like the firmer side. Plus a pillow that makes side sleeping easier like a U shaped pillow or two pillows on either side. Marijuana, especially a strain with cbd and thc, helps me some. I struggled with tossing and turning due to hip pain until getting the purple mattress! Worth a shot. I love my Purple mattress. It has truly helped me have the best sleep ever! My husband swears by the pillow too! I am so glad the mattress helps you as well. I have the Purple Harmony pillow and love it!", "What position(s) do you hold to support yourself and others if you do? Do you have a job that you love and doubles as a hobby?

I cannot tell you how much I love this post. It is so refreshing and uplifting to hear some positivity on this subreddit and I am so happy for you. And I want puppy pictures!!! My own pup is a little ray of sunshine and often helps me get moving and ignore my pain for a while.\n\nAs for me, I have been waiting this month for my own 2 bedroom to be ready to move into (next week, finally!) with my fiance. In the meanwhile I created and got printed physical Symptom Tracking Journal books and got a few sent out to people to try the prototype before I make a marketable version. It is really nice to put my illness towards something productive. That is so wonderful and thank you for your kind words. It is so important to share the good along with the bad. I too use my illness and hardships to propel me into positive actions. It is not always easy but creating things and helping others has been a guiding light. I am so excited that you have put your knowledge towards helping people and are reaching a major goal! Thank you for all you do! Also, 2 bedrooms is amazing!! Congrats haha Brilliant! I am genuinely so pleased for you. I think I speak for everyone when I say we are going to need to see puppy photos when you bring her home. I am most proud that I actually cleaned and scrubbed my shower this month. Love this!! Accomplishments like this remind us how it feels to be \u201cfunctional\u201d, they are not always easy but it is important to appreciate ourselves for having accomplished them anyway! Thanks for sharing!! I went on a 5 Mile hike on the Appalachian trail this weekend. I feel like death now but it was so worth it to do something I grew up doing even to a lesser extent than I used to. That is incredible! Glad you were able to get that experience. You might have a longer recovery period than you used to but it was probably well worth it! I hiked 15 miles in 3 days, including 4,500' of cumulative elevation gain. I ran one shots of D&amp;D 5e pen and paper roleplaying game on an online platform for two groups and both gave positive feedback.\n\nI am now seriously considering to run a pre-written campaign as story teller/game master online now also for people who apply and I do not know.", "I cannot remember not in pain  This is a bit of a desperate rant, I do not need replies or condolences just need to vent.\n\nMy neck, shoulders and upper arms are in bits, it is usually muscle pain and weakness and general lack of mobility but it now feels like nerve pain on top of that. It stops me sleeping and wakes me up early. Heat helps a little but then it kicks of nausea. I used to lift super heavy weights, pole dance, gymnastics, swim.... Today I went to the gym and could not do a lat pull-down. Bench presses are off limits. I had just started competitive lifting and today I struggled to lift an 8kg kettlebell. My lovely partner had to help me put my clothes on and off. \n\nI was at the start of my career, looking forward to developing skills and moving up but I think stress would destroy me now. I am lucky to have a low impact desk job with a great organisation who made lots of adjustments for me but now I worry that more stress or responsibility would be too physically challenging. I barely got any work done today with the pain and fatigue and would not be able to function in a high pressure environment. \n\nI know it will be different, things will get better but I am so angry at loosing my freedom and physical strength.  I am well medicated and looked after but dammit, this is relentless. Also any tips for the shoulder pain and muscle tightness are welcome! I hear you and I understand. Sometimes it is just too hard to bear for a minute. I do not have any advice, I am sorry. But I hear you. I hear you and I sympathise. Hang in there. \n\nHave you had physio for your arms and shoulders? Last year my arm would get stuck if I lifted it for too long or my muscles would turn to jelly. Physio hurt like hell at first but it made a huge difference and it was so satisfying to see the progress I made. \n\nAre you newly diagnosed because while you are well medicated, it can take a frustrating amount of time for the medication to help. \n\nFinally, I have found my TENs machine is really good for  pain relief. Same. My body always hurts especially my neck and shoulders. A few years ago my doctor prescribed me the generic brand of flexeril it is a muscle relaxer that does not make me feel sleepy and helps. Also for me, my neck sometimes feels like it cannot even hold my head up like there is so much pressure on my neck and my head feels like it weighs a hundred pounds. A Chiropracter told me to lay down on a bed and hang your neck off the bed to take the pressure off your neck. It feels great sometimes. I do it often when I cannot get comfortable in bed at night because of the neck pain. I do not know if you feel this same pain, but I thought I would comment to see if it might help. It can be frustrating for the first year or so after diagnosis. It does get easier for most people after they have been on proper medication for 8+ months. Some medications do not work for everyone. If plaquenil does not work for you, then you move on to the next medication (usually methotrexate) Have you read the story of the spoons?  That will be helpful.  Also, it is common for us to think we know our bodies well, until something like this happens.  I would suggest you turn to the experts....find a trainer who specializes in athletics, and ask for help. Thank you, sometimes when I talk to friend they want to fix it, which is understandable but I think only a new immune system could fix it :) Physio is excellent, I used to get it but with covid out close contact services are shut. Booking in is the first things I will do when it is open. It is mad how many of us are plagued with shoulder pain. Newly diagnosed and still finding my way with meds which is why I am hopeful for progress. I know I am not a really bad case either. Thank you I just went on a big Google spree for flexergil. It sounds perfect. I was reading that neck and shoulder issues are particularly present with mctd. I get the neck pain \ud83d\udcaf and sleeping is always such a hassle. I will try your tip. Thank you You are right about turning to experts - once covid is gone and our close contact services reopen I will be all over that. I have had periods in the past that have been almost pain free so I know what to aim for. Thanks for your advice, you reminded me to keep at it :) It does not matter whether or not you are a bad case, you are still suffering and it is taken a toll on your quality of life. That is all that matters. If you want the \u201cspoons\u201d article, I will post it Please do :) Thank you. Everyone seems to allude to the first year being the worst. I started the hydrochloroquine and methotrexate and looking to bump up the dose of the latter. ", "How did you get your MCTD diagnosis? I have a positive speckled/homogenous ANA of 1:320, positive Scl 70, severe Raynaud's, positive thyroid antibodies, rashes, muscle weakness, consistent low level fever, and I feel generally terrible, but cannot get a Rheumatologist or Endocrinologist to take me seriously. I am to the point that during flare ups I have so much muscle weakness, shaking, and cold sweats, I cannot get out of bed or lift things, but no one will diagnose me with anything because I have a mix of symptoms not just one category of symptoms. Is this MCTD and should I push for a diagnosis? None of us can make an MCTD diagnosis over the internet. Only a rheumatologist can do that IRL. Unfortunately it can take 5 to 10 years for autoimmune patients to get diagnosed, it certainly took me two rheumatologists before I was. \n\nAs to your question - My husband was still in the US Navy, so the Naval Hospital ran every single test they had available. My rheumatologist said he would never seen a workup like it. Seriously, syphilis, HIV, you name it, they ran it. I would already had a tentative Lupus SLE dx from a GP, so he refined it to MCTD. Roughly 10 years later, another Rheumy refined it again (disease process and all) to primary RA, secondary Sjogren's. \n\nSounds like you need a new rheumy, frankly. Like things keep coming up positive and they are like, \"yup, you do not have it\" and then do not explain when I am like, \"that does not make sense, should not that lead to more testing?\" Hi like, \"that does not make sense, should not that lead to more testing?\", I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 \"If you are not able to make a diagnosis, I will find someone able to help me\". Then do that. We are not doctors (at least I do not think any of us are) so we are not qualified to diagnose you.\n\nIt *could* be MCTD, but equally, it could be a lot of other autoimmune conditions or it may not be autoimmune at all.\n\nAutoimmune diseases are not quick or easy to diagnose, lots of people wait months or years for answers. When you say that no one will take you seriously, can you elaborate? Are they saying nothing is wrong and you do not need a follow up or is it more that they are saying \"we will see you in six months...\" Either way, it is really frustrating, I am just trying to get a better idea of what is going on.\n\nAre you keeping a symptom journal so you can show them what your day to day life is like? That can really help give doctors a better idea of what you are dealing with.\n\nWhen you ask if you should push for a diagnosis, do you mean MCTD specifically or any diagnosis? There is nothing wrong with telling your doctor that you are tired, scared and frustrated and that it would really help you to know what it is that you have, but you have to prepare yourself for the fact that right now, they just do not know. I pushed for a diagnosis myself. Not sure why but it gave me a sense of control. It also made me feel like the doctors cared and like I was not just another number. I am not sure where you are in the world but it does sound like you have the symptoms of MCTD. Are you male or female? How old? I found that having your symptoms (random and all over the place but indicative of autoimmune) can actually benefit you in finding a thorough doctor if you look in the right place. Are there any teaching hospitals near you or clinics officiated with a university? I ask because out here in California we not only have UCSF but also UCD which are widely known schools for their medical research and competence. My doctor took a shot and referred me to one and the doctors were intrigued by my symptoms so I got in really quickly. I have since gotten the best care of my life with them. The doctors are young and freshly out of med school (something you do not want for brain surgery but perfect for a disease that is strange and relatively new) so they have the latest research fresh in their minds. It is worth looking into. Other than that, keep trying Rheums. You have all the symptoms and should not live like this. May I ask which doctor you were referred to and how you like them? I am in So Cal and have just begun looking for a specialist. I found a few that look promising at UCLA, but I have not made an appointment yet. It sounds like it and yes, you need to advocate for yourself. Maybe see a neurologist or immunologist. I have a doctor at UCSF. Definitely try a Rheum at UCLA! That is a great place to start Thank you! Oh and... if you find a good doctor there, lmk since I may be moving to LA in the near future :)", "Planning for pregancy Hi  I was given Emgra tablet after IUI.. is it safe to use and can u plz help to understand the usage after IUI .. please advise as I found it is not safe for poeple planning for pregancy ", "Lupus or MCTD? ", "Mctd and joint pain Hey People,\n\nI got really bad joint pain in my knees and hips but on mrts there is no damage being observed. They are not swollen nor red, maybe sometimes a bit warm but that is it. \n\nWhat did you help with joint pain? Im on aza (100mg/d) and quensyl (300mg/d). \nDid anybody try out some other meds ? Did anything help? I am in the same position. I am taking hydroxychloroquine which does seem to reduce the inflammation to the point where nothing is visibly red or swollen and then naproxen for pain relief. It takes the edge off and I add cocodamol when it gets really bad.\nI also take glucosamine because it helps prevent connective tissue damage. Thanks for replying! \nGlucosamine sounds quite nice! But I do not want to use any pain killers, because I think on the long run they make you worse (destroy gut lining etc..). \nWhat I do not understand is that my blood works are completely normal. Except of the Ana there is no sign of inflammation or abnormality. How can my immune system  attack my joints if mctd seems to be in remission and there is no permanent damage done.. so confusing CBD oil for joint pain and inflammation.  Also you should join the facebook MCTD groups.  They are orders or magnitude more helpful and active than this sub here on reddit.  These FB groups have been the single greatest resource for helping me deal with MCTD yet. I know, it really is confusing. I do not understand how it is possible but apparently it is!\n\nI am not a fan of painkillers, either, but I reached the point where I just could not function without them. Omeprazole can minimise the risk of stomach issues, which makes me feel slightly better but in an ideal world, I would prefer not to be taking them.\nGlucosamine has the added benefit of potentially reducing damage to the heart, so I do recommend it. CBD oil has helped me for joint pain. I take some every night. Can you recommend a product available in Europe :D? I have never really had visibly swollen joints but I have had the pain. I lived in a country where I could not take hydroxychloroquine for MCTD, only SLE, so I was stuck with prednisolone and pain killers. Before I got pregnant, I was on a mixture of tylenol and tramadol for pain and nothing for inflammation. Since I got pregnant I have been on prednisolone and tylenol for pain. NSAIDS have not done anything to help me. I used CBD topical rubs, Tumeric and tart cherry juice.\n\nI also would recommend talking to your doctor about Cymbalta. I started it for anxiety, but also learned that it is used for fibro pain as well. I have recently stopped taking it for other reasons, but I noticed a difference in my knee, ankle and hip pain (also just overall joint and muscle pain) almost instantly. I did not realize how much it helped my pain until I stopped taking it and I will definitely go back on it in the future. So you Are a mctd Patient? And you took cymbalta for depression etc or fibro? \nBest I started Cymbalta for my anxiety, at the time I was not diagnosed with MCTD, but my doctor said it might also help with my \"mysterious\" joint pain. \nFast forward about 6 months, still taking Cymbalta, started with a new doctor who diagnosed me with MCTD. I decided to stop taking Cymbalta as my husband and I want to start a family (not pregnancy safe)...my doctor of course said sure and helped me ween off but did mention that Cymbalta is also prescribed to help MCTD patients and patients with Firbo to help with their joint pain.\nNow being diagnosed with MCTD and having stopped taking Cymbalta, I have noticed that it tremendously helped with my joint pain, and in my case, also my anxiety. I plan to take it again in the future.\nHope this makes sense!!", "Poll for the Community: Has anyone experienced any strange phenomenon where your partners or close friends/family have developed similar symptoms as you? This is a bit of a strange one. My question stems from concern for my significant other. Is it possible that being exposed to my illness and the stress of committing their life to me with a degenerative illness is causing them to get similar symptoms? I am wondering if it is sympathy pains from our close attachment (co-dependency) or if I should encourage them to get their ANA levels checked. Anyone else experience something crazy like that? Maybe I am just traumatized from my own experience and paranoid about protecting my family. Looking for sincere opinions so please be kind.\n\n( My wife also has an autoimmune disorder so it is pretty clear why we have some overlap My mother and sister both have autoimmune diseases. My husband is a disabled veteran and has his own challenges, which interestingly enough means we are on some of the same medications. Did you develop them before meeting or did one of you get it after the other? We probably both had them before we got married but were not diagnosed until after and not at the same time. Well, there are phenomenons like \"folie \u00e0 deux\" where someone actually mimics a psychosis from a close person and suddenly gets better when separate from them.\n\nFrom non-mental illnesses, I never heard of that - but huge disclaimer that I am no expert!\n\nBut what our disease and open discussion about it might bring, is that people are more perceptive of their own body and might look out for similar symptoms more. Since MCTD has many very basic symptoms that can be caused by a lot of other stuff (joint pain, nausea, malaise, cold feet, skin problems whatev), there can naturally be a lot of overlap, I reckon. Thanks for your reply! It makes a lot of sense. You are probably right that I am hyper focusing on common symptoms of any ailment. My mother and brother have other autoimmune diseases. I would not say being around them caused me to get it; I would just blame it on genes, environment, and bad luck.", "Poll for the Community: Do you like your Rheum?

I have suspect connective tissue symptoms, and I will be seeing a rheumatologist in early January. \nI recently had a surgery where a cyst was removed. It ended up being a super rare kind of cyst, but through reading all the scientific journal articles present (literally starting in 1920-- there are very few). Most articles state that because of the rarity etiology is unknown, but one or two mention a possible link to connective tissue disorder(and/or SLE).\n\nSo... This is a long shot, but I had a multilocular peritoneal inclusion cyst on my mesentery (a rare location, too)-- this also seems to be known as Benign cystic peritoneal mesothelioma.\nHas ANYONE had anything similar? Be it mesenteric cyst or BCPM-- I am curious if there really is a link between CTD and this, as it would be helpful to bring the info to the rheum. \nI get this is a long shot with less than 150 cases of BCPM described in literature since 1979 and with mesenteric cysts occurring in 1/200000-1/350000 persons (at least in regards to adults)\n\nThanks in advance", "MCTD research opportunity ", "Newly diagnosed Hello everyone!\n\nI was just diagnosed with MCTD just this week after feeling well most of my life (I just turned 50).\nI guess my GP got tired of me showing up in her office every few months complaining so she FINALLY sent me off to see an internal medicine specialist. After a multitude of blood work it showed that I tested positive for ANA (twice) and also tested positive for anti RNP. I am currently waiting to see a rheumatologist to see what this all means.\n\nI have been reading a little bit on google (trying to avoid the scary stuff) but I do not seem to have a lot of the symptoms most people have. I do have pain in one hip (diagnosed with osteoarthritis) and currently having some digestive issues. \n\nI just went through what I think was possibly a flare? Out of nowhere, I became ill in late December. I had severe weakness (could not stand for more than 5 minutes) and was having some strange digestive issues. I missed weeks of work because I felt so miserable. I ended up have major anxiety, which is something I have never had before. Thankfully, I seem to be turning the corner as the weakness has gone but the digestive issues persist. I am currently awaiting an endoscopy and ultrasound on my abdomen.\n\nI am scared to dive too far in to google as I am not yet ready to hear the possible bad stuff due to my high anxiety levels. I just wanted to say thanks for allowing me to join your community :) First off, I am 72, and have lived, quite well, with it for 30+ years.  Do not trust any site except large medical centers like John\u2019s Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, or their Canadian equivalent.  There are lots of things to rule out, from breast implant illness, to separate gastrointestinal conditions, to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.  If you have a competent rheumy, you will have lots of tests.  If you do not, change rheumies.  Get ready to assemble a health care team you can trust, from neurology to psychiatry, because the anxiety from mis-diagnoses can lead to panic attacks, or worse.  Make sure you keep records of ALL of your tests and doctor visit.  Make a notebook, maybe with plastic sleeves to hold test records, with a master sheet of everything by date.  Take it to all appointments.  Be your own strong advocate. Come here for questions and support. Thank you so very much for your reply and advice! I will definitely do everything you have suggested. Thank you! Remember, we are here. Definitely avoid Google. I freaked myself out to the point that I needed sleeping pills for a month.  There is a lot of scary/worst case scenario info out there but in reality, it is possible to live well and even achieve remission.", "Poll for the Community: Do you still struggle or attempt to understand your illness? Whether you have had MCTD for months or years it is not an easy thing to wrap your head around. Perhaps this month you acquired a new symptom to add to your collection or maybe you were doing really well but were suddenly hit with a flare up and not sure what caused it. I find that in these times I tend to research the cause and effects and how the fluctuations play into my illness. I am wondering if other folks have the same tendency and/or interest in understanding exactly what is happening and why.\n\n( I find it is easiest for me to understand it by understanding the component diseases that are most active in me: primary RA, secondary Sjogrens. I focus on researching ways to improve my conditions / alleviate symptoms - as well as research about MCTD in general I had so many doctors misdiagnose me along the way that I never blindly trust anything a doctor says.  I will check medical journal abstracts on Google scholar to verify.", "Mctd? I have had anti rnp levels since I was 19 at around 8. Is this diagnostic of mctd? Only other symptoms I have are joint pain all over and fatigue. I am 26 now. Good luck getting a definitive diagnosis. I have been trying for years. Hey... remember, we are no doctors here and you are giving just very little info.\n\nWhy was your anti RNP tested? What kind of test system was it (e.g. Smith/U1 RNP in combination or just U1 RNP)? What is 8 for a unit? Titre? Units per mL? Does the report state if this is higher than normal?\n\nDid you get a \"general\" ANA test? Was it positive as well? Did you get a high titre?\n\nDo you get cold (and numb) feet and fingers? Do your fingers or parts of them turn white, then blue (might only catch this phase when feeling numbness/pins and needles)?  Afterwards, they might appear a bit more reddish. This is called Raynauds' phenomenon (in short Raynaud).\n\nSadly, joint pain and fatigue are damn unspecific and can have many causes. Thus, many GPs do not really want to have a closer look on it if there are no further alarming symptoms. So it is important you have the overview of your medical history - which examinations you already had what your bloodwork results are.\n\nIn theory, yes, U1 RNP antibodies are prevalent in almost every MCTD patient and thus pretty much mandatory for a positive diagnosis. But they can also occur in other connective tissue dieases, such as Lupus/SLE. So if you have positive antibodies, it does not mean that it has to be MCTD. Raynaud is pretty similar in that aspect. There are other illnesses that cause it but almost all MCTD patients have Raynauds.\n\nIn any case, you should probably go get a referral to a rheumatologist (if you are not already seeing one). They will run many blood tests to figure out what it might be.\n\nIn any case good luck! I am not sure what the units were, I do not have the papers with me right now, but the max normal number was .9 I think. \nI went to rheumatologist today and he said lots of people have false positives on the anti-rnp. I do not have any other ANA positives besides that one. He told me I have fibromyalgia and to exercise. He drew more labs to test inflammation in my muscles. Will update later. I also have elevated RNP levels, 1.5 with a range of &lt; 1 and a positive ANA 1:640.  Do not have Raynauds, but get random muscle aches and pains for what appears to be no reason. Same about the muscle aches and pain. I will update what the rest of my tests say when they come back. You have any other symptoms? I do not have Raynauds. It is mostly random aches and pains that are clearly not caused by an injury or overuse. Also get random really thirsty spells and a feeling of lightheaded/dizzy/irritated around 5:00pm I do not have raynauds. I have aches and joint pain in my hands, feet, neck, and upper back. Muscle shaking in legs when walking down stairs. Muscle weakness in face when I try to smile. I feel foggy and lightheaded alot. The doctor said I am a little high strung which he got from my reflexes when he hit below my knee with a mallet. So I think he just thought every thing caused by stress My reflexes are a 3+ but it is consistent all over. I have spoken to a few professionals about this and so far what I gather is that you can have all the immune markers, but if you do not have the \u201ckey\u201d symptoms then you are in the clear. \n\nWhat is odd though is that the pain is still there and it is inconsistent. It can be a painful jaw/neck for a few hours and then end up in my leg or back. \n\nI know my cortisol levels are also high. I have my rheumatoid visit on Thursday.\n\nYou notice if anything helps? Or does it help to avoid anything in particular? It is been constant for me for years. I pretty much gave up and accepted it is my normal. I did not feel this way when I was younger though. Low stress days, I do not feel as foggy but my muscles still are sore.", "Tips on supporting friend with MCTD Hi all, a friend of mine was recently diagnosed with MCTD. I would never heard of it until I started reading. Now I am scared and worried because she is older at 65+. Good news is that the doctor does not think any organs are affected at this point and put her on prednisone and hydroxychloroquine. \n\nWhat can do as her friend to support her during this illness? For those who suffer, what do people around you do that makes YOU feel supported? Thanks ahead of time. Listening. Let her complain to you. It is so hard to have to suck it up all the time, you need somekne you can be real with.

Getting up from sitting or  walking we need breaks  I am so excited to actually see somebody ask! me personally and I know there is a few other of us because I have read we just feel like people look at us like we are Big o hypochondriac babies the truth is it controls every aspect of our lives I wish you was my friend \ud83d\ude22 I have interstitials cystitis and mctd.

Stress is a huge factor in my ability to function.

I am not a hugger but I would love to give you a big old hug and say thank you hang in there Moderate intensity aerobic exercise, especially swimming, is a great idea.  Help your friend keep moving!", "Clarification about Test Resilts I have a positive ANA Direct and a positive RNP (1.2 Al), but negative Sjorens markers. Is it possible to have a positive RNP, but not have mctd or any disease? Yes, it is possible. But I do not have any Sjrogen\u2019s markers (? I would like to hear more about this!) and was still diagnosed MCTD based on Positive ANA, RNP and clinical symptoms (joint pain, fatigue.) Do you remember your RNP value? I want to say it was in the 500\u2019s? I cannot be sure, but it was high ish.\n\nHere is a textbook that discusses what tests are needed for MCTD diagnosis, however I think the full copy needs to be purchased to see numerical values of test results. I am on my phone so I cannot double check right now.\n\n\n Okay thank you! I assume you mean Sjogren's? Were they testing you for Sjogren's, and you were positive for RNP Antibodies instead? \n\nTypically, positive ANA with positive RNP points toward MCTD, but can also mean lupus (SLE). But a diagnosis should depend at least as much on symptoms. If you are not having any of the symptoms of SLE or MCTD, they would probably say your diseases is not active at this time, and it may never be. 1.2AI is not very high, so it could be you do not have enough to have triggered disease. On the other hand, it is possible to get a diagnosis based on symptoms without the supporting antibody tests. \n\nAre you having symptoms more consistent with Sjogren's (dry eyes, mouth, etc.)? There are separate antibodies for Sjogren's but they are not always positive.\n\nIn my case, I have the positive ANA and positive RNP antibodies, but my symptoms and associated issues are pretty much those you see in lupus, so my rheumatologist often refers to my disease as lupus instead of MCTD. Since Sjogren's is not considered one of the overlap syndromes within MCTD, I have actually been told I have Sjogren's on top of the lupus/MCTD, because I have the symptoms. (But not the antibodies specifically for Sjogren's.) Personally, I think that is a failing of the definition of MCTD, as it is a related disorder, and I do not see a good reason why it is not considered along with the others as being a part of MCTD.\n\nIt is all very confusing and changes often. And not even all rheumatologists agree on definitions and diagnosis. I have had non-rheumatologists put rheumatoid arthritis as one of my diagnoses instead of either lupus or MCTD, because they really do not understand the difference between these disorders very well. It is something that needs a lot more research, but it does not get much funding or interest among researchers. Thank you for this detailed response. So you are saying it is possible to have Sjogren\u2019s symptoms but not any antibodies? That is interesting. This has all been very confusing for me, my symptoms are joint pain in my hands/fingers, Raynaud\u2019s (really bad on my feet), and I do have dry eyes/mouth but I am on several medications that might be the cause. I think the answer you get will depend on the expert/rheumatologist you ask, but I would say yes. I have been told by more than one doctor I have it, and yet I do not have the antibodies. I think once you have any kind of autoimmune disorder, you are more likely to have other autoimmune disorders, even if you do not have each individual antibody identified. And I really believe that Sjogren's symptoms are associated with other autoimmune disorders, like Lupus and MCTD. So whether it is truly a separate diagnosis or really just another manifestation of the Lupus/MCTD is really more of an issue of debate than absolute science. Are there any tests to determine if you have besides RNP antibodies ?", "What should I expect at my first appointment? Last Sunday i got the results of my bloodwork back from my primary doctor. They emailed me saying 'The blood test is suggesting there may be a link to mixed connective tissue disorder.' Its not a diagnosis, but perhaps a start to helping. They scheduled an appointment Monday with a Rheumatologist for me. \n\n**What was your first appointments like? I am not sure what to expect.** Wow, that is impressively speedy!\n\nThey may want to take your bloods again to confirm the results, it may depend on whether or not the first tests were with or without (\n\nThey will go through your medical history, family history and ask you about your symptoms. If you can, it might help to write down everything you have been experiencing and when it started so that they get the best possible idea of what is going on with you.\n\nFor future appointments, it can really help if you use an app like Bearable (r/BearableApp) to track your symptoms and pain level so you can spot patterns and triggers. If you are given medication, it can help you see whether or not the drugs are working. \n\nThey may do a physical exam, looking at your whole body, especially your joints to see if there are visible signs of disease.\n\nI do not know about anyone else, but I was prescribed medication at my first appointment. I have no idea whether or not that is normal.\n\nGood luck, I hope your appointment goes well.", "Finger sausages Anyone else experience edema / water retention?  Any advice on how to deal with it?  I have MCTD &amp; Sjogren\u2019s and sometimes it is like they are at war. I am dry &amp; bloated. Need some tips to deal with this crazy. Are you in the states? I have mctd and cutting out gluten GREATLY decreased my hand pain and swelling. I do not think it is necessarily the gluten but the glyphosate sprayed on all the wheat in the U.S. I still get sausage fingers sometimes but not nearly as bad and I hardly ever have pain now. It is probably not a permanent fix, but I am hoping it could keep worse symptoms at bay for a few years I also have MCTD along with Sjogren\u2019s and always have varying water retention. I can second this comment in that I have noticed less if I avoid gluten (or carbs in general). May be worth a try. I have tried gluten free and grain free over the years  (for years at a time) and it does seem to help at first and then the bloating returns. I sometimes do think it is more just a general carb reaction - but then  I will eat a lot of carbs and nothing happens. Frustrating. \n\nRight now I am trying an over consumption of water. About 100 oz a day. That has helped clear up my constipation and belly pain issue I was having. And it seemed to help with the bloating at first. Yesterday, when I told this to my rheumatologist she warned me to make sure I get enough salt. Just a pinch in each glass. I tried that and bloating receded. Fingers crossed this sticks and the bloating does not return again. \n\nI have read about glyphosate as well. Weird and disturbing stuff. After reading this article on ( it occurred to me that I no longer sweat and that that may be contributing to my sausage like tendencies.", "I found the Wim Hof Method to be helpful The Wim Hof Method is a set of exercises designed to boost endorphins in the brain, thereby not killing pain, but crowding it out making it less noticeable. Also it aparently makes the blood less acidic and more alcaline, and therefore helping with inflamation. I found that it works for my MCTD, but I would like some more guinea pigs. Anyway to start go to ( , hit E-Learning and choose the 3-Part MiniClass. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThis helps me, but I want to find out if it is physiological, or phsycological.

I will read over the mini course and check it out again ", "Does anyone else get more flare ups in the colder months? Hi all! So I know this sub is not super active but I was wondering if anyone else noticed that they have worsening symptoms in fall/winter? I was first diagnosed this time of year in 2017 and it was pretty terrible at the time. I actually do not remember how I was this time last year - at that time I was only a few months out from finishing chemo for a co-occurring non-hodgkins, which I still get maintenance infusions for every two months. Currently having a pretty bad autoimmune flare up right now and I am not sure why. Could it be the weather? My joints were doing so well for so long :( I am trying to remain as active (and positive) but obviously it is difficult. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nThanks for your time. Hope everyone is feeling ok  :) I do! Mostly when the weather changes (rain/snow) or the weather dramatically changes hotter or colder. Heating pads are my go to. Oh wow what a relief. I mean I am sorry you go through it too of course but this definitely takes some of the mystery factor out of it. How long after the weather change until you usually end up adjusting? Yep. My wife is going through a big flare up at the moment. Drugs were reduced over the summer because she was feeling better but that is changed now and the dose is going up again , Immuran &amp; prednisolone.  An Iloprost infusion was a big help last year Usually 3-4 days. I am on plaquenil. Sometimes it stays for a while because the weather is constantly changing. Cold is my biggest trigger. I forgot when I moved to the UK because I barely got flares there but then when I moved back to Canada I was reminded once again how much pain and other symptoms I get during the winter.\nIt really, really sucks. Rapid weather change is a huge trigger for me but also eating certain foods like red meat and sugar. Usually when it gets cold I get bad flare ups and bed ridden for days. Just happened actually but have been slowly getting my energy back and able to do things normally. Really appreciate this thoughtful and helpful answer. Thanks @ u/ramenpussy lol (love your username btw). \n\nI try to be really careful with my diet too. I think I am finally adjusting to the weather as well. Glad you are starting to get your energy back a bit  :) Haha thanks! I was trying to change my username because I thought it was a bit too vulgar but glad you like it :) best of luck with your condition! I am back in bed now boooo Ohh nooo!  :( Yeah it started raining again out my way as well, hopefully my body does not protest too badly. Hope you have a quick turnaround", "Poll for the Community: Do you struggle with mental health issues on top of your MCTD? Whether you have been diagnosed or not, let us be real - life can bring on some serious stress.  Especially on top of chronic pain, fatigue, and other symptoms, too much stress can be detrimental to our mental and physical well-being. Addressing the fact that you might also be struggling on an emotional or mental level can be very enlightening. Often it can even give you insights about how to help your body and mind recover. Let us understand just how many folks in this community struggle with anxiety, depression, or other difficult and typically misunderstood illnesses. Please, please, if you are comfortable, consider elaborating in the comments as your story might just resonate with and help someone else. \n\n*As always, these are sensitive subjects so keep all comments positive and respectful!*\n\n( Being in pain all the time sucks.  I have also noticed my overall well being is strongly inversely tied to Air Quality Index. My mental health was an issue long before I became physically ill. I have had a diagnosis of cyclothymia since my teens and have been on antidepressants my entire adult life.", "Elevated RNP antibodies but no obvious MCTD symptoms Hey everyone! I am new to this subreddit, but not new to the autoimmune world. I was diagnosed with celiac disease and hashimotos in 2019. I feel fairly knowledgeable about the symptoms of both and how to manage them. \n\n\nHowever, in 2019, I was also diagnosed with MCTD by my rheumatologist. This was due to a positive ANA at 1:320 with a speckled pattern. The only antibody that was elevated on my ANA titer was RNP at 2.10 AI. My ESR was elevated at 25 mm/hr. My lupus screen was negative and there is no evidence of major organ involvement. I do have elevated antibodies for my thyroid and I did have the celiac antibodies elevated until I went gluten free.\n\n\nI feel mostly fine on the day to day. The only complaints I really have are fatigue. I could lay in bed all day every day with zero complaints. Although I am not sure that I feel tired, mostly just low energy. I also have mild eczema that is mostly around my eyes and neck.\n\n\nSo I guess my questions are... What does MCTD look like for you? Is the bloodwork an absolute diagnosis? What sneaky symptoms do you have that I may be overlooking? (For context, I had no idea I had celiac until I went GF and realized how bad I had felt. So I worry that I may have symptoms of MCTD that I have written off as normal). I am trying to increase my knowledge of MCTD as I plan to follow up with a rheumatologist in the coming weeks. Hi I am with you! I have few symptoms and have been dx for 10 years, I originally had only RNP positive and now have merged into more of a Lupus outlook (dsDNA now abnormal). I think this is pretty normal. My rheumatologist said that it was actually pretty normal to have milder symptoms as MCTD than if you had any of the singular diseases themselves. Your lab results should have a normal range with results as this range will be highly variable lab by lab. \n\nBy definition MCTD is abnormal RNP without other sub ANA abnormalities.\n\n\nLastly prognosis for MCTD is highly variable based on symptoms so if you have mild symptoms that likely means you will have greta prognosis and vice versa. I think people have a concept that autoimmune disorders have to be horrendously debilitating and sometimes it is, but often times it is not\u2014feel grateful for that! Hey! Thank you for sharing your experience with MCTD! To clarify, does your rheumatologist now suspect that you have lupus as opposed to MCTD? Or that your MCTD  \"evolved\" into lupus? Also, were you prescribed any medications for your MCTD even with few symptoms? No pressure to answer any of these questions if you are not comfortable doing so!\n\nI guess the MCTD diagnosis has just been hard for me to accept in a lot of ways since I cannot relate to a lot of the symptoms or experiences that people seem to have with MCTD. It is helpful to hear that I am not alone in that regard!\n\nThank you again :) In MCTD and UCTD it is common for you to begin to skew towards one of your \u201cmixed diseases\u201d over time. Not the majority but for some people that is the course. For me it was Lupus. A lot of rheumatological diseases are a bit subjective to the doctor, so I think having strict disease markers can be a trap. For example: plenty of people with lupus have never had a malar rash\u2014something that is \u201challmark\u201d for Lupus. Also a lot of the treatments are similar across diseases, so to this point\u2014it might not matter which disease I have if I take the same med for both. I was prescribed Hydroxychloroquine and has worked very well for me. I totally resonate with the \u201cI do not belong here,\u201d feeling when you have mild symptoms. I feel this often. To this end you might be: lucky, have your disease caught early so symptoms are milder, caught early so you have yet to develop symptoms of MCTD and might down the line. I completely agree. It is tempting to want to view medicine as a black and white thing. However, there is a lot of subjectivity and grey area in all areas of medicine. Anyway, I appreciate hearing some insight from someone who has had a diagnosis for a considerable stretch of time. My doctor had also prescribed me hydroxychloroquine for MCTD back when I was initially diagnosed, but I never got around to starting it. Something to discuss with my new rheumatologist. Thank you again. :)\n\nAlso, I have thought a lot about that. Reading some of the experiences has me paranoid that one day I will be immensely ill and that my MCTD was simply caught early. However, I could also be lucky and mildly affected. Regardless, I am lucky to have a diagnosis (seemingly the hardest thing to get with autoimmune disease) so that no matter what comes my way, I will be better able to advocate for my health &amp; well-being. Yes! Glad this helps. I am an adult now but I was diagnosed as a preteen and the first thing my mom told me is \u201cdo not research it, you will just get freaked out.\u201d Now that I am an adult and *have* researched it\u2014great advice. Rheumatology diseases can be scary because there is no cure, it is highly variable, and sometimes we do not know the pathophysiology so there is not great reasons for what is happening. I think just seeing the worst does not help and only harms your mental health. Also there is a good possibility it might never be that way so it is a lot of unnecessary worry/anxiety.  I would focus on what you have control over and find a good provider. \n\nI have had little/if any side effects with hydroxychloroquine and it is one of the mildest/safest drugs for autoimmune\u2014so if you are open to it I would say go for it! I imagine that was hard to avoid as a preteen since most of us who grew up in the 2000s had easy access to the internet. I am glad you listened to your mom because oof, the first thing I did when I was diagnosed was research it. I definitely cried a lot at the time, thinking I had a terminal illness that was going to kill me in a few years. I think I went through all the stages of grief before finally ending up in a persistent state of denial with the mindset of  \"I do not feel THAT bad, therefore my doctor made a mistake in my diagnosis\". So, I am glad to have found this subreddit because hearing actual experiences of people with MCTD (as opposed to lists of symptoms or statistics) puts things into perspective. I can have MCTD and still not be as sick or symptomatic as I was with my other autoimmune conditions.\n\nGood to know, thank you! I think at the time I was terrified of visual changes. However, reading about it now, it seems like it is quite rare to have serious side effects and that it could help quite a bit with the symptoms I do have. This is so on the nose for me, so I am very interested in responses. I have been losing my hair, having menstrual irregularities, and extreme fatigue since 2016. I was searching for years for answers. The hair loss turned to hair and eyebrow PAIN and hair loss (like a burning) in early 2020\u2026that is when I started panicking. \n\nMy bloodwork all came back normal except low C3 / C4 complements and positive ENA (specifically RNP @ 1.6). My rheumatologist at the time said that can happen with some normal people and that I am probably fine (eye roll). I then went to see a second opinion, who looked at the notes from the previous rheum, shrugged and agreed with him.\n\nFast forward to March of this year, I was diagnosed with celiac via bloodwork and endoscopy. I expect I have had it my whole life. So I assumed that was the causes of my symptoms. However, in the months since then, they maybe lessened a bit, but not really. I went back to see a new third rheumatologist and my ANA, dsDNA, and everything was normal again, even my inflammatory markers were in lower normal ranges, but my ENA - specifically RNP came back anywhere from 1.4-1.6 again depending on the round of bloodwork. She believes the scalp burning and extreme fatigue are MCTD. I am starting Plaquinil soon to see if it helps, but I have not started it yet so I cannot speak to its effects.\n\nI will say, I have no significant body pain, joint pain etc. I also found it a bit odd and unnerving to be diagnosed without the major symptoms outside of scalp, energy, and menstrual irregularities. Though I do sometimes get some joint stiffness if I lay a certain way, but I think that is pretty normal. If I was not losing all my hair w/ a burning scalp I would just think I was an excessively tired normal person.\n\nI guess I cannot say 100% that I am confident in this diagnosis, but so far it makes the most sense, and it seems to come in milder forms for people like us. I guess we should feel lucky, but the prospect of it developing into something worse is nerve wracking. I get bummed out sometimes that doctors allowed my celiac to go undiagnosed for so long that I likely developed this secondary issue afterward. It still gets me down many days, because I was banging down doors telling people I was sick and no one believed me. I think they wanted to write me off as someone with PCOS even though I was underweight from celiac. \n\nI am also a bit confused as to what warrants a strong positive vs a low positive RNP, as info online is not helpful. Mine has come back at 1.4 and 1.6, so 2 is pretty close to me, so perhaps we are in the milder disease side of things.\n\nI hope you find answers and feel free to connect with me via message if you have any questions or want medication updates, as we seem to have a similar path (or you have developments you can share!). I know we all just want to feel \u201cnormal\u201d again! &gt;Lastly prognosis for MCTD is highly variable based on symptoms so if you have mild symptoms that likely means you will have greta prognosis and vice versa. I think people have a concept that autoimmune disorders have to be horrendously debilitating and sometimes it is, but often times it is not\u2014feel grateful for that!\n\nSo glad to hear something positive about this. Thank you.", "diclofenac Does this help anyone? I was just given this for pain 75mg morning and 75mg night. I have not noticed anything yet so I am wondering does it need to build up taking it a week or so before I get pain relief? It is a NSAID so you should notice it right away if it are to help. It is not a terribly strong med but it also just may not work for you. May need something else. Good luck! the gel version is wonderful. it works right away. if you try a different anti inflammatory it might be worth it to try the gel too. its especially good for small joints like in your hands. good luck, hope you feel better soon! Did not do much for me\u2026 It works great for me right away when my joints are hurting bad.\n\nIf it does not help, ask for another pain med or please only up the dose when agreed on with your doctor.\n\nDichlofenac (like any med) has side effects and safe ranges, so stay safe. Please do not take it with another NSAIDs either.", "Do you experience guilt for being \u201ctoo exhausted\u201d for things? In the early days of my illness I was super positive about helping my body. I started cooking and eating clean, exercising, and resting more. Then I hit a rut (more than likely a Covid-induces rut). I have not consistently worked out (yoga, Qigong, mild workouts) or meditated. I have managed to keep up with a relatively clean diet but my sleep schedule has run off the rails. I feel sick almost every morning so I decide to not do yoga, I feel so exhausted some days that I just choose to sleep right through to the afternoon. I am struggling to find the line between \u201cI am sick and need rest\u201d and \u201cI am being lazy and letting my illness define me\u201d. Anyone else been there? Any advice, thoughts, etc? I know what you mean, but not respecting your body's limitations only makes it worse. \n\nWhat helps for me is doing short bursts of things, like pick up toys and then take a break. Vacuum, break. Mop, break. Sure, I could do it all in one go, but I will pay for it the next day when just moving hurts. \n\nThe most important thing is to listen to your body, if you feel like you cannot do a full yoga routine, try doing a shorter one, or one focused on stretching and relaxing your muscles (I do not know anything about Yoga though, so feel free to dismiss this. I have read about something called Yin Yoga that supposedly helps with connective tissue?) Wow, thank you so much for your reply. I feel like I really needed to just be understood! I like the idea of just doing things and taking breaks as needed so I will try to focus on what I have accomplished and not what I have not. It is just so easy to get wrapped up in feeling depressed that I cannot just power through anymore. Powering through used to be a huge part of my identity. I am still new to this though so I appreciate the advice and I will give it a try :) And maybe a little fine tuning of the description...instead of saying you feel guilty, try saying you feel sad.  Sad that you are not able to do what you want, or sad that your motivation declined.  Sad gives you a reason to try.  Guilty says you did something wrong. (You did not, by the way...you just took a break) Just my perspective -\nI would never have thought to ever advertise walking around your neighbourhood - but it really helps me to do something active when I really do not feel like I can manage anything else.\nFor me, podcasts or reddit on phone are also welcome additions. I love looking at things from different perspectives. Thanks, I will try this :)  It is so true... just getting up and walking around outdoors makes things feel a bit less worrisome. Once our air quality gets back up into the healthy zone (smoke in the air due to wildfires), I will do my best to at least get outside every day. All the time and I cry bc I miss having the energy to spend fun time with my kids. You are welcome.   \nI believe I have mentioned it before on here, but I fell sick when I was 13, and I will be 28 in a few months, so I have had a while to figure things out. \n\nI know the powering through part, there are days where I will need to, but after I have pushed myself I need to relax in order to not suffer too much. It is again knowing your limits, and in extension knowing how far you can cross them with minimal consequences (I have landed myself in the hospital a few times as a teen). Now, this could also just be me, since my bloodwork/mctd is pretty calm at the moment (Rheumatologist's words) Same Us too. I am in So Cal and the air quality is horrible.

Is anyone living with MCTD without medication? I have been off medication for a few years, only started some when I was pregnant but now im slowly getting back off them. \n\nDiagnosed in 2012 med free from 2014-2020 Do you take any supplements? No, honestly it depends on how severe your condition is. \nI have been blessed to not have many flare ups I mostly get bothered with joint pains and my hands are difficult sometimes. \n I definitely recommend Theraworks, it is amazing with joint and inflammation \n\nAre you thinking of going off meds? Definitely speak about it with your primary, I only stopped because of the long term side effects and because I noticed that being on meds or off did not really make a too much of a noticeable difference. Is it even possible to live with MCTD and not taking meds?? My doctor told me recently, that the average life expectancy with this condition is about 45 years if your medication is not well-controlled ... Diagnosed at 35, now 72 and on omeprazol, pilocarpine, and Lexapro only Me. There are only 2 options where I live, and both make me feel worse than I do without medication. I see my specialist every 6 months, I manage pain with ibuprofen and/or paracetamol.   \nBut my lab work shows hardly any activity, as my specialist says, \"my blood is calm\", so I might be an exception. I have been surviving for the past 7months.its no cake walk that is for sure. I lost my job during covid and trying to get back on my feet. Trying to find something that I can do that I am not either standing  the whole time or sitting the whole time is not working out so far. I am just caught in a vicious cycle That is fantastic. How is your stress level? My 17 year old granddaughter was recently diagnosed with bipolar it is a bad situation she was my world I still love her more than anything but she just woke up one day a total different person her mother has had it since she was 16 and she lives with me so my stress level is through the roof. I have been out of work for almost 8 months now my goal is to go back by May the 1st but good days are bad days. Bad days are horrible so I am just out here lost in this vicious cycle of pain. I really did not have any choice I lost my job during the covid and I am like you I really cannot tell a difference plus the side effects were bad the only difference was when I was working I just pushed myself and now I am trying to go back to work mostly for my mental well-being. I will check into theraworks. Thank you so much I am so sorry to hear what you have been going through lately, I truly hope things will start looking up for you soon.   \nI have a three-year old, and I am back in college (online due to covid) to study programming, so the combination is very stressful. I find it helps to take a moment a day just for myself, that can be something mindful as yoga or it can just be drinking a cup of coffee while it is quiet in the house.   \n\n\nHow long have you had MCTD? In my experience, the disease was so much worse at the beginning (15 years ago) than it is now. Stress still triggers it, but I have not been anywhere near as bad as back then. My actual diagnosis was 5 years ago but I know I have had it for at least 10. For people have died in the past 10 years that I was very close to my mother my rock my best friend died of cancer my son was killed my  ex father-in-law I dearly loved the only one on that side of the family that I could tolerate died a week after my son was killed and my grandmother died right before my mother now I am dealing with a bipolar 35-year-old daughter 17 year old bipolar granddaughter and what she is done to herself her life hurts more than well almost more than losing my son who  was also bipolar so I am just one big ball of tears. I put myself in time out daily my 4-year-old granddaughter said Nana you  like time out do not you? I said honey when you get as old as Nana you will understand timeout is a good thing. I stumbled across Jordan Peterson so I like to listen to him when I need encouragement.Thank you for sharing good luck with your studies best wishes I agree that it was much worse at the beginning. Almost 20 yrs later, I only take Tylenol or ibuprofen as needed. (I have actually never taken anything else for it.) Massage, chiropractic, and talk therapy have also helped me over the years. I know I am lucky to only have to think about my diagnosis when it hits hard. Hey there. I do not have MCTD but my wife does, so I lurk on this sub trying to learn as much as I can to help however I can.\n\nIn response to your question, I was going to say \"define medication,\" but I read over some of your replies here and see that you lost your job during Covid and you are considering supplements vs. actual \"medication.\"\n\nMy wife does not take any medication (it all made her horribly sick) but she takes a few different supplements. The thing that actually helps her the most, though, is CBD/CBG. She grinds up ( and puts it in her coffee in the morning, and without that she could not function nearly as well. I can tell when she is run out before she tells me. \n\nShe takes other stuff too. The most helpful stuff she takes is ( and vitamin D in liquid form that she gets from one of the local health food stores. She puts those in her coffee too.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nSorry you lost your job, by the way :/ Thank you so much!!!! I was using cbd for anxiety/ stress once I got through a rough month I backed off . It is very expensive high grade guess you know that. Really never thought about it helping with pain duh mctd has really messed with my memory. Your wife is very fortunate to have you. I am trying to support my bipolar daughter and it is VERY STRESSFUL  which is very hard on my MCTD. I live in a vicious circle. Thanks again bless you and your family Depending on where you are, you may be able to get cheap/free treatment for the bipolar. Those are the kinds of meds you definitely do not want to go off. Bipolar meds especially - suddenly stopping those can mess up your liver. I fell on hard times a few years back and found a local sorta-free psych clinic. They determine your ability to pay and then the cost of the visit is on a sliding scale based on that. It was like five bucks a visit for me since I had no job and all.\n\nApparently these facilities are pretty common in the US. I know they are in at least four states. I got their info just by calling the local psych hospital and asking for it. \n\nAs far as the CBD/CBG thing, the good thing about putting it in your coffee (I am told) is that you do not need much of it at all to see a recognizable benefit. My wife's still in the relatively early stages of MCTD, but between all the supplements and CBD/CBG and everything, it is roughly 30 bucks a month. Definitely manageable, and definitely worth it. She still has good days and bad of course, but that at least takes some of the edge off. It is good for depression too, though I cannot speak to how well it would work for mania. Probably pretty well? \n\nSince you mentioned it, she likes the Jack Frost brand I linked to above specifically because it did not mess with her memory/cognition :)  .. That is why she orders that specific kind online instead of just buying some from a store. YMMV, of course, but it took her a while to find that specific type. \n\nI can only go by what I observe and what she tells me on the MCTD front, but I can speak firsthand about the anxiety/depression, and one thing that applies to all of the above is to go easy on yourself. If you need to take it easy one day, do it. With chronic conditions like that, it is important to listen to yourself. I used to feel bad about taking off work when I was having a Bad Day but that only makes things worse. Be kind to yourself. It is tough out there.\n\nThis community is pretty supportive (I normally only lurk unless I think I can help somebody), but there are a few larger Facebook groups that can help. That is where she found out about NAC, and a bunch of other stuff too. For instance, it turns out cinnamon actually helps with joint inflammation, so her coffee does not taste terrible in the morning after adding all that stuff to her coffee, lol\n\nWish you the best :) My daughter is the one dealing with the bipolar issues and she has the insurance but she also knows everything so cannot tell her nothing cannot suggest nothing mental health Care sucks in Northeast Tennessee. What is NAC? I have went on the bipolar Facebook pages and so far the support pages have people popping up that are bipolar and they get really nasty really quick and I most definitely do not need that in my life I live with it everyday. Do not know if you have ever heard of kratom but that helps me tremendously in the mornings it is nasty but that is about the only way I can get moving in the mornings. The only thing about kratomy is you can build a tolerance very I have someone on here in the credit sub that is really helping me understand it more.It is like CBD it is either a godsend or the devil I do not think there is any people straddling the fence on it but I think it is fantastic four mood pain anxiety it is my environment I need to work on but how do you put your child out on the streets? Thank you so much you really helped It sounds like you are having a hard go of it :/ I am sorry to hear that.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the mental health communities on the internet can get nasty. I was actually suggesting you check out the MCTD group on Facebook. that is where my wife heard about a lot of the things she takes, including NAC. \n\nI do not really know what NAC is, lol . . . I linked to it in my first post. It is a supplement. She opens the capsules and pours it in her coffee in the morning. It helps her with some of her joint stiffness and stuff. \n\nKratom helps you with your pain? Interesting.  . . I definitely would not suggest putting that in coffee though. That stuff is really nasty! :)  That was actually why we did not get any more experience with it. How do you take it? I have heard some people put it in orange juice but that was just about the worst thing I would ever tasted when I tried it. I take a  normal size prescription bottle put hot tap water in it 3 G of red 3 G of green. Put a little water in first add powder more hot water but leave enough room at the top so when you put the lid on it and screw the lid on do not do the safety the child safety thing it leaks shake it shake it shake it shake it I just toss it back Chase it with 20 oz of water then a cup of coffee my daughter likes it when she takes it with orange juice but where I have interstitial cystitis too much orange juice causes irritation. The kratom people on the kratom sub is way too smart and scientific for me but there is people that swears by actually making a tea and keeping it in the refrigerator but the way I do it you really cannot taste it if you just swallow that bottle full of mud LOL and then immediately Chug water the coffee. I tried making it in  adding it to a cup of stress relief hot tea anxiety relief  last night and chasing it with a small amount of orange juice and I do not think I will do that again it was not too bad it is just the prescription bottle water coffee method works best for me. Lots of people have some crazy methods that I would never try or have the time and patience to concoct it but it is most definitely worth giving it a try there are vendors that will send you free samples just go to different websites and straight up ask do you do free samples I have got them from three different vendors and only had to pay shipping which was $3.99 I think on one and the other two were totally free but do not ever  get it from the gas station or smoke shop. I just ordered me some Jack Frost so we will see how that goes the only thing about that is my daughter did get some from a smoke shop and and it showed up positive on drug test. I have got to go back to work soon so I will cross that path when I get to it.\nKratom is very unique it is very individualized product reds work best for pain with me greens help with  mood white is supposed to be stimulating but the one time I took it I had to leave a store and come home and take a nap but it is never ever ever happened to me again if she does go that route you must stay hydrated there is this stuff you can get it Walgreens or on Amazon called liquid IV it is like a flavor packet to add to water  taste pretty good but it helps with your electrolytes and stuff and also kratom can cause constipation which I had trouble with all my life until my son was killed for about 6 months then the constipation came back so now I take magnesium at night and it works great might be TMI but being constipated is a serious issue lol I will have to give that a shot. I love the idea of just going in and straight-out asking for a free sample, lol ... I am going to try that at the car dealership! :) \n\nWifey's been taking Jack Frost every day for a few years. She passed a drug test no problem. But, again, YMMV. Good luck :) YMMV? That is great the stuff she got come from a gas station The stuff she got came from a gas station. Your Mileage May Vary :)", "IgM deficiency Anyone else got IgM deficiency?  I am curious if that is common. Good question! I may have my doctor test for this because I was researching IgM and IgG recently for other reasons. Based on symptoms I have, I was expecting high IgG, which now that you say it... does cause IgM to decrease so that is kind of interesting \ud83e\uddd0 IgM is my only out of range immunoglobulin I have it", "Would like to hear about throat / esophagus problems with MCTD Hi there.  I was diagnosed this year with MCTD.  I seem to have a lot of lupus symptoms, photo sensitivity, rashes, episcleritis, dishydrosis, joint pain and stiffness, some hardening skin, cold and tired.  I had been living with all of these symptoms for years but it was esophagus problems that started me down the road of seeing specialists until the MCTD was diagnosed.  Unfortunately almost two years later and I am still having the same esophagus problems and I am wondering if anyone here can share their experiences, treatments and diagnosis for esophagus complications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy problem is that my throat is swollen and uvula so large that it just sits on my tongue and gags me.  The first 10 months or so got really bad as I had NO idea what was going on.  After 10 months or so I figured out that eating wheat / gluten causes my throat to feel swollen which lasts for three weeks to a month.  Benedryl liquid helps with the feeling in about 60 seconds...wish I had known about that back in the beginning to save me from literal months of feeling like I am being strangled.  Once I discovered the wheat / gluten I stopped eating it in every possible form.  75% improvement to throat / choking / gagging feeling.  I now only eat food I prepare myself, and I am trying to stay on a whole foods diet.  But I have read so many conflicting things.  Among things I have heard not to eat are: wheat / gluten, tomatoes, potatoes, kale, red meat, alcohol, garlic, alfalfa, nuts other than almonds, peppers, eggplant, sugar, all dairy...do all of you avoid these / have flare ups from some of these foods?  What about coffee.  I love coffee but it makes my throat feel so tight (I think it is the coffee...still learning).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust looking for a little support.  I am seeing so many doctors and yet I get 5 minutes with each to explain 30 years worth of medical problems including some very distressing current symptoms like feeling like I can hardly breathe.  I had to sleep sitting up for almost 10 months :(  I am hoping other experiences might help me to learn about mine.  Most unique symptom is that I do not have trouble swallowing food.  The ONLY time my throat does not bother me is when I am actively swallowing food.  As soon as the food is down, my throat feels like it is closed again.  Food never gets stuck in my throat nor do I feel like it is going to.  Weird.  Please share any / all anecdotes and experiences you have.  Thank you for reading. sounds quite similar to me. I have gained a considerable amount of weight due to swallowing food making it feel like things are not stuck in my throat. I know for me, once I started take medicine to treat my mctd, things got somewhat better. I still have issues with my throat, but I am able to swallow food now and it not bother me too much later on. I still cannot eat within 8-10 hours of going to the gym, or else food will start to come back up. It was to the point where I had the same problems with breathing. Even going to the ED at my local hospital due to it once or twice before.\n\nI also have issues drinking anything (only coffee and water). They never seem to stay in my stomach and/or will feel like my stomach cannot contain the liquid, thus it leaks out into my esphogus if I try to lay or anything after drinking. I am a student who is very busy, and due to my insurance, I cannot see doctors that are literally a couple blocks from where I go to school (the school has a school of medicine). So i am unable to see a gastro. dr to get this taken care of. When I was seeing the gastro. dr. I was told there are things that can be done to help remdy this. One of the biggest things they did was put me on an anti acid so acid is not coming back up with food.\n\nIf I were you, I would keep trying to visit dr. if you have the means to do so. Be persistant! It is nice if you have a esophagal specialist you can go to. I did not notice you mention anything about any treatments you are on. I am taking plaquenil (spelling???) and it is starting to lose affectiveness on controlling my symtoms in general. If you are not on anything, maybe talk to the dr you see your mctd for and consider plaquenil as it made things somewhat better, as i mentioned before. \n\nGood luck! hmu if you want to bs or w/e\n\n Hey, worldostrich333, just a quick heads-up:  \n**persistant** is actually spelled **persistent**.

Pretty annoying that your post got hijacked by bots lol\n\nI get joint flare ups with white flour. I already do not eat meat or dairy but I hear they often contribute to flare-ups. \n\nI have had esophagus problems for a while too. At first I thought it was from co-occurring non-hodgkins lymphoma. A bunch of the lymph nodes in my esophagus and spleen had been enlarged and were causing constant endless nausea. Now that I am in remission and it is still there, and I have found out about the mctd, I wonder if that is the cause? Does anything help yours? 100% zero wheat or gluten.  I do not even eat out any more due to cross contamination.  This reduces my symptoms after about a month.  I am now on he AIP diet trying to find other things that are perhaps triggering my symptoms.\n I was looking into the AIP diet a bit last year before I found out about the cancer and did a modified version of it. Once chemo I just ate whatever I could stomach. It is probably time to cut gluten though, especially now that I have found gf oats I like - there is really no excuse haha. \n\nHow is aip treating you? It is very hard to be strict with.  Almost all oats are contaminated with gluten.  Unless yours say gluten free you can count on cross contamination in them.  For me, anything like that would be enough to give me 30 days of flare up Yeah they are bob\u2019s red mill and they are specifically gf  :)", "Poll for the Community: Do you have MCTD?

First time happening to me. Could it be from my medication (Prednisone)?  I am not sure I am seeing what you are concerned about. Can you describe more what you are experiencing? It is little red patches, I have been getting them on my knuckles and fingers but this was the first time happening on the inside of my palm. It is kind of a stinging sensation. Hm, I do not know what it might be. It does not seem like it would be related to prednisone, though. I get weird stinging itching skin things that come and go mysteriously, and I do not know why. I take it as just another weird thing. But my body usually has enough things going on at any moment that I do not focus on any one for too long. Sounds related to your circulation. If it is a new symptom and new medication they might be related. Tell your rheumatologist if it is bothering you. It could also be related to dermatitis caused by some kind of chemical or soap. Maybe it is inflammation? When my inflammation flares up, my palms will have a red spectacled pattern kind of like that, and they will sometimes sting/throb/feel itchy This happens to me as well during high stress situation(today actually, on an exam) or during an intense run. Does not sting tho in my case. Also on prednisone, among others (\n\n(Do not let the main pic scare you) My hands have permanent redness in my knuckles and fingers.  It was probably my first symptom but I attributed it to working in a cold environment back then.  Once I got diagnosed and researched MCTD, I read that red and swollen hands or finger joints are a pretty common symptom. I sometimes get red spots like that on my hands and feet. They itch and sting. Sometimes my skin peels afterwards. That is exactly what my hands look like every day since last winter. The pads of my finger tips are always red, sometimes it is more pronounced. I do not have any stinging sensations or pain with it. I am on 400 plaquenil . We are you able to get feedback from your doctor?", "Does anyone get chest pain in waves? I think my husband has MCTD and Really his only symptom so far is chest pain on and off.

I have Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (tested and was told it is not autoimmune) and had an ANA panel done in September. I tested positive for SM/RNP and had a 1:80 speckled titer.

I was a bit confused on how she said she wants to wait and see if I develop symptoms but then offfered me the prescription.....", "How long did it take to get diagnosed &amp; what were your blood tests like? Hi all :)\nI will try to keep this brief otherwise you will be reading for days lol.\n\nBackstory:\n\n15 yrs ago I got \"sick\" all of a sudden (for lack of a better word) &amp; I was just so exhausted, like falling asleep while counting money at my desk at work tired. Just feeling \"off\" n unwell.\n\nAbout 5-6 months after this started I got viral meningitis, we thought \"bingo! This is why I was feeling so yuk\" the docs did not agree so that ruled out that idea!\nAnyhow afterwards I was getting bad, almost daily, headaches, was so far beyond exhausted I was so tired, n just felt generally unwell 24/7. After 2 yrs n copious amounts of docs n specialists I was dx with fibromyalgia.\n\nAbout 4 yrs ago my symptoms just changed overnight. It was like my fibro took a backseat, the aching stopped etc n I felt different. I know my body so well after being sick for so long that I knew this was different. This was new.\n\nI went to a few docs n a neurologist who would had a former patient with mctd said he believed that is what I had n passed me along to a rheumy.\nThe rheumy was a dickhead. Got his lackeys to ask a thousand questions, n even tho I  had really bad memory issues (that is improved quite a bit), would not even let my mum talk to help with symptoms, timelines etc - important stuff that I had forgotten. He spend all of MAYBE 10 mins with me, told me that the blood tests I would had were false positives n it was fibro.\n\nThe strange thing about the false positives is the same tests were done 12 mos apart n BOTH showed  positive ANA, homogeneous pattern with a 1:360 titre, plus a positive ANCA test (P-anca was my pattern). My GP was furious, said they were wrong n in his opinion, they would been too quick to just blame the fibro, n I 100% had mctd or lupus (my mum had SLE). He started treating me for mctd using the typical plaquenil n immunosuppressants. Took a wee while but finally worked out that the only drug that helped was Azathioprine (or decent daily doses of steroids) but my liver could not take it.\n\nNow bcoz he does not know what else to do/drugs to try n is concerned about giving me something (with my now a bit buggered liver from all the meds), he wants me to go back to a rheumy n try to get it sorted. I had the appointment via phone (NZ in lockdown) n he gave me n my mum the impression that it is nothing. We are SO worried as I KNOW there is something wrong n it is 100% NOT fibro, we feel as tho I am guna be swept under the rug again, so to speak.\n\n\nSo after all that backstory, my questions are:\n* What are your symptoms?\n* How long from getting sick to diagnosis?\n* how did your blood tests look? What was positive (ANA, ESR, CRP etc) n the titre?\n\nMy ESR n CRP have always been elevated for years n years, my ANA is homogeneous (dsDNA etc always negative) with 1:320 titre, P-ANCA postive. My GP said there is no way these are false positives when it is been 12 mos between tests.\n\nMain symptoms are:\n* Swelling, painful n stiff hands/joints, sometimes its hard to hold a pen and or write.\n* Bad hand tremors (it is not Parkinson's or MS)\n* I am getting the odd bout of Raynaud's type purple fingers\n* Ridged fingernails (down the nail) plus sometime horizontal (across nail)  ridging/beau lines\n* Being out in the sun (if it is too hot but worse in direct sun) makes me really sick, like all day in bed vomiting etc (not fun when camping in a NZ summer at Xmas time!)\n* No energy\n* Lots of ulcers on tongue, in mouth n scabs up nose\n* I get chest infections/pnumonia a LOT (it does not start as a cold etc, just straight to pnumonia) n have had pleurisy a few times (had chest x-ray 2 else ago n is clear)\n* Bad headaches, daily, just severity that changes\n* Bad skin, esp in typical butterfly rash area n gets really bad if I do not wear sunscreen but even if I do, direct sun on my face sets it off, it is kind of like wee sores\n* Dry eyes, VERY dry mouth. Similar to dry horrors/cotton mouth when hungover (I do not drink, have not for years) n no amount of fluid seems to make it go away\n* Periods stopped approx 12ish years ago, docs/gyno do not know why\n* Sore feet, like every joint (esp on top of foot) feels like every tiny bone  is sprained\n* Nausea/queasiness\n* Extremely tired 24/7 but no matter how much or how long I am asleep I never feel rested\n* Sensory overload, noise mainly but not as bad recently\n* Memory issues\n* I have zero drive to do anything, even the thought of doing the washing etc is mentally exhausting\n\nI think that is the main ones, lots of other small things but I cannot think properly atm, I will add any if I remember I have missed anything important.\n\nSorry it is so long, so I appreciate it if you have made it this far!\nAny n all help will be HUGELY appreciated :) I honestly could not tell you what my bloods have been like, because I have never really looked into it. My GP and rheumatologist both explained but it went over my head. In know my ESR and CRP are always elevated, but I could not tell you the rest. \n\nI am incredibly lucky, it took just over a year from the time I became ill to get a diagnosis and start treatment.\n\n&gt;Main symptoms are: * Swelling, painful n stiff hands/joints, sometimes its hard to hold a pen and or write. * Bad hand tremors (it is not Parkinson's or MS) * I am getting the odd bout of Raynaud's type purple fingers * Ridged fingernails (down the nail) plus sometime horizontal (across nail) ridging/beau lines * Being out in the sun (if it is too hot but worse in direct sun) makes me really sick, like all day in bed vomiting etc (not fun when camping in a NZ summer at Xmas time!) * No energy * Lots of ulcers on tongue, in mouth n scabs up nose * I get chest infections/pnumonia a LOT (it does not start as a cold etc, just straight to pnumonia) n have had pleurisy a few times (had chest x-ray 2 else ago n is clear) * Bad headaches, daily, just severity that changes * Bad skin, esp in typical butterfly rash area n gets really bad if I do not wear sunscreen but even if I do, direct sun on my face sets it off, it is kind of like wee sores * Dry eyes, VERY dry mouth.

I will re post it now, thank you :) When I was 12 got rushed to the hospital could not breath my oxygen levels where low that is when it started for me I did not get a diagnosis till 16 at children\u2019s hospital in Pittsburgh. I am 39 years old it is been a long long journey. It took a year and one misdiagnosis. I was fairly lucky since I am up by the Cleveland clinic and my mom was used to doctors. I mainly presented with reynauds, arthritis and fatigue. Oh, and the butterfly rash. \n\nBlood tests had elevated levels of what they tested for- high enough there was a methotrexate treatment. \n\nIt has been fifteen years and I was a young teenager so I dont remember really clearly. Is this guy a DO rheumy? Those initials matter. Like it sounds beautiful and holistic but sometimes they can be pretty dismissive in my experience. Not sure what a DO rheumy is, but he is one of the top rheumys in the public hospital where I went (NZ public healthcare is free) Hi there, I have been diagnosed with MCTD. For me, my symptoms started to be noticeable only about 2 years ago. For the last 2 years I have been through many ups and downs, have had some of the most amazing doctors on my case, and am lucky because not only do I have a real interest in biology but I have been on disability for about 6 months which has allowed me time to really research my thousands of blood results. Now, to be clear upfront, I am still struggling with my illness and do not have a cure for you and I cannot imagine having dealt with symptoms as long as you have but I do still have some hope that I figure it cannot hurt to share. Much of my life has been spent studying psychology. It is fascinating just how intertwined our mind and body truly are. When I started to get sick, though, is when I started to learn just how much of an impact that had on our health. Our genes are like light switches and certain traits can be switched on and off throughout our life depending on the situations we find ourselves in. I strongly believe that our bodies communicate to us, first through things like anxiety and fear, then exhaustion and depression, and eventually physically by attacking itself (autoimmune). Similar to a bad hangover or food poisoning - it is unpleasant but it is how our body communicates to us that something is wrong and needs to be fixed. Often times Western Medicine misses the mark by treating (covering up) the symptoms (or signals our body is trying to give us) but because we patients are not medical professionals we doubt our own instincts. I have many people in my life with a vast array of autoimmune disorders and majority of them have struggled with mental health issues or even just too much stress. Unlike viral infections or parasites with outside invaders, autoimmune diseases are your body taking things into its own hands. If you are interested in learning more about this holistic type of approach there is a very beautifully written book about one Western Medical Doctor\u2019s journey through her own experience with an autoimmune disease. The book is called \u201cBrave New Medicine\u201d by Cynthia Li, MD. Highly recommend for some inspiration and also to just not feel alone in this. I am no expert yet (plan to be a doctor myself someday) so please take this with a grain of salt and a lot of your own research. Medication can sometimes be the only way out for some people but if struggling for years, holistic methods and intuitively listening to your body brings hope back into the equation.   Happy to discuss more if you are interested!", "Managing GI symptoms I get a lot of gut pain, sporadic diarrhea, blood in stool (rarely), and loss of appetite.  To manage this, the best things I have found are gluten free diet, light alcohol consumption, edible cannabis with CBD and THC, Pepto, adequate hydration, eating small frequent meals, high quality yogurt, Schiff digestive advantage, occasional low dose prednisone, and frequent aerobic exercise.  I have had a two camera shoot (endoscopy + colonoscopy), and my gi doc says this seems to be MCTD and nothing GI specific.  \n\nI am curious to know how GI stuff goes for other fellow MCTD folks.", "Extended Flare-Up or New Normal? Hello! I am 24F and have been experiencing symptoms for the last 4 years, and have been diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease for about 2 years. \n\nFor the most part, my symptoms are inconvenient yet manageable. However, this past January, I had a persistent fever of 101-104F for 7 days and was then hospitalized for an additional 5 days (12 days total). I knew that this fever was more serious than previous flare-ups when I was unable to go more than 20 minutes without vomiting. Unfortunately, with COVID being such a problem at the time, I was terrified to go to the hospital knowing that I would be exposed to the virus. As a result, I unintentionally let my flare up cause so much inflammation that I was completely immobile and forced to be hospitalized. \n\nWhen I was admitted to the hospital, I was unable to walk, sit up, use my hands, or even lift my arms. I was additionally diagnosed with polyarthritis as most (if not all) my joints were visibly swollen. My CRP level was 124 (normal is below 3). I was given IV steroids while in the hospital, and was prescribed prednisone post-hospital. The doctors told me that it was unlikely a flare-up, but that my body was likely responding to a cold and went into hyperdrive.\n\nI was in physiotherapy to begin walking again (I had significant fluid in my knees), but even with this support and my medication, I was unable to walk independently for almost a month after I was discharged. \n\nSince then, I have experienced a significant increase in my pain levels and a decrease in my threshold for activity. I used to be an avid runner (5-10km/run), whereas now if I am active for more than 20 minutes I become feverish and fatigued for several days. \n\nMy question is: has anyone else had a similar experience? Additionally, is this a prolonged flare-up or my new normal? I am soo sorry you are experiencing this, sending you warm fussies and virtual hugs\ud83d\udc9e It may just be a temporary normal. What does your rheumatologist say? What meds are you taking? Has your rheum added any new meds since the hospital? Were you tested for covid when you were hospitalized? Were you vaccinated? thank you! :) I was tested for COVID 4 times while at the hospital, negative results each time. Vaccines were not available for my age group (in Canada) so I was not vaccinated but have received both shots since then. \n\nMy rheumatologist has stated that my knees did not heal quite properly, that my knee cap shifted as the swelling went down, causing patellar tracking disorder. This seems to be the root of a lot of my knee pain which affects my ability to walk and stand up. They did not seem too concerned with the rest of my symptoms.\n\nI was prescribed prednisone while at the hospital and was slowly weened off it over the course of 4 months (stopped mid-April). I have been taking 1.5 tablets of hydroxychloronique since February, and while I have noticed it helps my Raynauds I have not noticed a huge shift in my other symptoms. \n\nThank you for your response! If your rheumy is not helping you reduce symptoms even though you have clearly stated what they are and that you need assistance making them better, it may be time to go for a second opinion someplace. It sounds like you had a hell of a flare up though. Something that might help you keep track is a symptom log, something where you can write down your symptoms every single day, how you are feeling, and a pain score on a scale of 1-10 (you can find hospital quality pain scores online, usually 1 is happy and no pain, 7 is a bee sting, 9-10 are like childbirth or kidney stone) and then you can take that to your rheumatologist and also it will help you determine if you are getting better, worse, staying the same, if this is your new normal, if you are on the mend just very slowly, which btw people with mctd and SLe tend to heal slower.. just really try to narrow everything down. And try to take up some forms of relaxation and easy exercise like stretching, meditation, and yoga. Also write in your log what pain relievers you took that day (tylenol, ibuprofen, aleve, meloxicam, whatever) and see if one helps more than another.", "Positive RNP test and doctor wants to see me, have to wait three days for what I am assuming will be a diagnosis of MCTD. So I have not been diagnosed with anything yet but I had some blood work done that flagged positive RNP antibodies. I am worried to death and I am not sure how I am going to survive the next three days until I meet with the doctor. He did not want to talk about it over the phone which worries even *more* so I am ultra freaked out right now. I am assuming he wants to tell me in person that I have MCTD? I just wish I did not have to wait until Friday. That is really all I have. Sorry, guys. Try not to freak out, it would take a significant number of symptoms in addition to the positive rnp result to warrant a diagnosis. Google diagnostic criteria for MCTD and you will see what I mean. \n\nLast year around this time I had a terrible flare up that involved rashes, splinter hemhorages, joint pain so bad I could not walk and it would take me 20 minutes to get out of bed, blood work with inflammation markers through the roof, positive rnp, fatigue and probably other symptoms I do not recall and I still do not have an official diagnosis. I had to do a bunch of tests to rule out endocarditis, then I had to have a skin biopsy and do a pulmonary function test. The flare lasted about 7 weeks, my rheumatologist monitors me now twice yearly but will not commit to a diagnosis yet, he is calling it Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease because I do not have enough of the symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of MCTD. \n\nSince the random flare/attack last year I have been almost completely normal and most days feel pretty great so even a diagnosis of UCTD has not really been life changing. \n\nI cannot see a doctor calling you in and just handing you a diagnosis, there is so much you would probably need to be tested for and if your body is not currently attacking itself and causing permanent damage to your organs, chances are he is not going to do much for you. Hope this helps. I am still new to MCTD as of this year, so I cannot tell you much. Just know that it is rare, and take some comfort in that. Google will do nothing but send you into a tailspin so avoid it if you can. Symptoms can vary from person to person and it can take some time for a doctor to hand down a solid diagnosis. The condition overlaps so many things so it takes them some time to really nail down what they believe is going on.\n\nIt can be scary, but try to keep yourself from overthinking. I made myself worse by panicking. When you do talk to your doctor, just have whatever questions prepared that you want to ask and take it from there. Thanks for this. I think I fit more of the symptoms for UCTD than MCTD but I just wish I did not have to wait until Friday. My guess is that he is going to refer me to a rheumatologist and possibly order some chest X-rays and then maybe run some more tests. I am still freaking out though. Of course my brain is going to worst case scenario. I just wish the lab results did not specifically point to MCTD on the website. It literally said this beneath the interpretation of the results \n\n&gt; \nRNP antibody is found in patients with mixed connective \ntissue disease in high titer. This antibody may also \nbe seen in systemic lupus erythematosus and other \nconnective tissue diseases. A positive result at this \nstage of testing stops further testing, and does not \npreclude additional positive antibodies. Clinical \ncorrelation is required to assess the need for testing \nadditional analytes \n\nBut I am not sure if it is high titer or low? Or what that even means apart from what it means for like vaccination status. i.e. like when they check your titer for rubella and stuff when you are pregnant to make sure you are still immune. Well what was your number? Not sure how your blood test works but with mine the ena test lists the 6 different things and anything less than 1.0 is considered normal, for all of them my numbers showed 0.2 or less except the rnp which has been either 1.6 or 1.7 each time I have done it. \n\nUnder the results mine says \u201cthis pattern of results (positive anti-RNP in the absence of other autoantibodies) would be most consistent with a diagnosis of Mixed Connective Tissue Disease\u201d \n\nI freaked out initially too when I read that before my follow up appt but just because you have the marker for it does not necessarily mean you have it. I read somewhere on another thread that someone is doctor described it as \u2018you are walking through a bad neighbourhood but you have not been mugged yet\u2019 Thanks for responding. I am trying so hard not to panic but I cannot help but google every freaking thing under the sun. I dunno, I just hope maybe I can have another blood panel done in a few months and see if anything's changed, if the markers have gone up/down, whatever. Ugh. Friday seriously cannot come soon enough. Thanks for your response. This is interesting, and I hope that is the case for me. I guess that is the best case scenario right now bc I have no idea what my numbers are. The lab just gives a &lt;1.0 (negative) or a 1.0 (positive). It did not give me the exact result/titer. I am not sure if the doctor has something different but yeah, they did not elaborate on that one like they did the rest of my lab work. Mine also said beneath it that it can be indicative of other connective tissue diseases which are obviously more common than MCTD. However the first thing mentioned is MCTD so yeah I am freaking out. Hopefully I will get a referral to a rheumatologist I do not have to wait a million months to see. Well best of luck to you and in the meantime just focus more on how you feel and try not to overthink it. Easier said than done lol, I actually experienced one or two panic attacks from over-researching and I literally felt like I was going to die. Never had a panic attack other then during that time when I was so stressed about it. My blood work two weeks ago still shows the 1.6 rnp but all my other stuff is mostly normal and I feel great so I am choosing to focus on that.\n\nI actually see my rheumatologist tomorrow lol, I am hoping he will tell me he does not need to monitor me anymore unless I develop more symptoms. Please update after Friday! I get it! Trust me, I do. I just got back from my 2nd of 3 doctor appointments this week. I have got lab results popping up in my inbox every few hours, some of them making sense and some not. More tests scheduled, etc. It is insane, and it is stressful. \n\nMy best advice would be to focus the present. Just take it day by day; the answers will come in time. Worry will not speed things up. Things will work out. Find something to distract yourself and again, definitely stay off of google! Nothing good comes from there. Good luck, my friend. Things will work out. Thank you again! I will update after Friday! As others have mentioned, your diagnosis is not that important at this point - be patient and avoid assuming the worst. Your doctors will want to treat the symptoms at hand first, whatever they may be. I did not have a solid diagnosis for about 2 years while dealing with major flares (the most dangerous issues being pericarditis and pleuritis). MCTD is very difficult to diagnose and to treat because of it being an overlap syndrome, presenting symptoms from a few other CTDs, symptoms which can be somewhat unique to each individual. Even if you do get a MCTD/UCTD diagnosis, it is still a bit confusing because there are no actual treatment guidelines for these distinct conditions since no studies have been done. It is not uncommon to feel as though you are sort of figuring things out as you go along, and this can be frustrating, to say the least.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, there is definitely hope, should you get this diagnosis. It may take you a long time to figure it out, but you can get there. For the most part, I am in flare remission at this point. I still have some lingering issues from previous flares (scar tissue), along with some daily issues like stiffness, tendonitis, etc., but nothing like the flares I had before we started to discover the correct treatment. Here are some of the things that really helped me out, and while they may sound simple, they have made an enormous difference collectively over time:    \n\n \n\n\\&amp;nbsp; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Cut out gluten completely  -Started lifting and exercising regularly (this helped a TON with the arthritis, as well as mental health)  -Eat healthy, especially less sugar (fish, greens, clean foods, etc)  -Get at least 8 hours of sleep every night  -Stop drinking alcohol (I find that this is pretty much like rocket fuel for inflammation)    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\&amp;nbsp;     \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd my biggest piece of advice is to not fall into the trap of letting your condition define you. Accept the hand you have been dealt, believe you can feel better, and do everything in your power to improve your health. Hopefully everything works out for you! Ok I saw my GP and then today I saw a rheumatologist and my GP did not see anything of concern, even though my ANC was borderline low, which made me immediately think autoimmune. He did say that something could have *started* and by cutting gluten out I sort of slowed it down bc when I cut gluten out of my diet my...stomach issues....got WAY better. However I was still having some issues so I decided to cut out dairy too since I was allergic to it as a kid. He said that pregnancy very well could have kickstarted these autoimmune responses since my symptoms only began in the past few years after I had a kid.\n\nAnyway, rheumatologist was not concerned in the least bit but he also said it does not necessarily mean the lbs were wrong, that 1) nothing could ever come of the RNP or 2) I could develop MCTD somewhere down the line. He basically said there is no way at all to tell unless/until I develop more symptoms or my symptoms worsen. Until then, tendinitis here and there is not anything to worry about as it is common as you age so long as it is fleeting.\n\nHe also felt around in my joints for inflammation and did not feel any, my heart and lungs sounded fine so no worries about that yet. I have never had Raynaud\u2019s which he said I would basically have to develop to get the MCTD diagnosis and I did not show any signs of lupus. Again, that is not to say none of this will happen, so I need to be weary of inflammation and careful with my diet. I may go back to my allergist to be retested for the food allergens too.\n\nHowever, I sort of want a second opinion. Like I want another rheum to say the same thing this one did, that I do not have anything to worry about right now. I also found this study if you are interested as I know we are both in similar situations! \n\n\n\nPlease shoot me any updates you get as well! Glad to hear everything seems to be okay for now. I have not altered anything lately because I have not experienced any symptoms so for now I am just business as usual. \n\nI went to my rheumatologist and my blood work looked great but because my previous lung function test showed a decrease in DLCO he wants me to go do another one to make sure it has not dropped further. And another echocardiogram but he did not explain what he would be looking for specifically. \n\nThe most important thing is I feel good so I basically just go by that and try not to worry about it.", "I was just given an official MCTD diagnosis I was diagnosed with lupus 8 1/2 years ago. Last week my nephrologist diagnosed me with Peripheral Autonomic Dysfunction due to Mixed Connective Tissue Disease. He has been suspecting mctd for the last 10 months (since I started to see him), but as far as I know this is the first time he is put it in my chart. Any advice for a new MCTD patient? I have lupus, also I have scleroderma symptoms, mostly in my hands, and I have some myositis symptoms as well. Hi and welcome! I think the biggest problem with MCTD is that everyone is symptoms vary so wildly and whatever treatment works for one person does not work for another, so you may always have to be adjusting your treatments and keeping yourself on your toes.\n\nThe best thing to do is just take care of yourself as best as possible, I have found. If I am feeling fatigued, I make sure to take a break for a day or two. If my joint pain is acting up, I take a hot shower or bath and soak for a bit and do stretches. If my Raynaud's is bad, I always make sure to have instant heating pads in my purse to warm up my extremities. \n\nI wish I could help you more, though. What are your specific symptoms? Unfortunately I find this subreddit is not very active, so I tend to frequent the other specific subreddits for ideas to improve my lifestyle. So r/lupus and r/rheumatoid are my current go to. Good luck with everything. Thank you so much for the information.\n\nMy lupus is my joints, skin, neuro (including raynauds), and fevers. \n\nMy scleroderma is in my hands, but the symptoms are not constant - as far as stiffness. There are some skin changes going on too.\n\nI am not sure if the muscle stuff is myositis or fibro. I am wondering if I even have fibro, since the lupus/mctd cover everything but the tender points. Also thank you for the luck wishes! You are welcome! I wish I could be of more help. How do you find your lupus symptoms?\n\nI have some myositis symptoms myself, mostly when I am sleeping but I have not found a fix for that yet. The pain wakes me up and I have to massage my upper arms until the pain goes away. I find that if I am on enough anti-inflammatory medications that it helps but it is not full proof. Admittedly, I have a milder case of MCTD, though.\n\nI also have the stiffness in the hands, stretches help but are kind of painful to get going, I think. I still cannot lay my fingers flat on a table or bend my hands backward but I can make a fist now, at least. A lot of my symptoms disappear with the right combination of medication as well, so above all I would work with your doctor to find the best combination of everything. He sounds pretty thorough, so that is good! I also keep a daily symptom diary and wrote down my pain levels everyday to show my rheumatologist when I have my appointments and it helps him determine if the current treatment is working or not. I would recommend that too# it helps to be able to look back and see how the pain levels fluctuate over time. Oh my lupus. I am not even sure where to start... my bad days are awful of course. Generally they are bad enough that I am stuck on the couch or in bed.\nI cannot use anti-inflammatory meds anymore due to (non lupus-related) chronic kidney disease. \nUnfortunately I do not have a rheum right now, and my primary is uncomfortable treating me beyond plaquenil and occasional pred tapers. My nephrologist is doing what he can to treat me, as he specializes in lupus. I really need to get better at keeping a health diary again. So glad to have found this reddit. I was diagnosed about two years ago and it has been hell trying to get it manageable. The bulk of my symptoms fall under RA and Lupus but I also have symptoms from Polymyositis, Fibromyalgia, Reynaud's Phenomenon, Sjogren's Syndrome and CREST Syndrome.  I also have Siderblastic Anemia which they cannot decide if it is related to Lupus or stand alone and Allodynia which can be part of Fibromyalgia or stand alone.\n\nNow, I realize that that is a huge and daunting looking list but my reason for listing everything is to show that becoming as educated about your condition is extremely important. Many Rheumatologists primarily focus on RA and/or Lupus and neglect the lessor know conditions unless the symptoms are just off the chart. The problem with that way of thinking/treatment style is that often times treatment for the symptoms of one condition can exacerbate the symptoms of another condition (even if the symptoms overlap). For instance, muscle pain caused by Lupus can have differing causes than muscle pain caused by Sjogren's Syndrome or Fibromyalgia. So if you are only treating the Lupus pain you can miss the other causes and still be in pain.\n\nThe key to combating this is self education, self advocacy, and finding a health practitioner willing and able to work with you on all levels. When they want to put you on any medication, research it thoroughly, including talking with your pharmacist, looking at the data sheet that comes in the originating container (ask your pharmacist for it) and looking for anecdotal statements from people who have taken the medication themselves. (That last one is really important because the medical community only knows what the pharmaceutical companies want them to know. If the Dr. says only worries are stomach upset but 90% of anecdotal statements report fatigue and mood problems then I would really consider that before taking the new medication.)\n\nSpeaking of anecdotal statements, the most common thread that I have seen in them is that people with MCTD who change to a vegetarian or vegan diet see a huge reduction in symptoms. Now, I have not been able to completely jump on that bandwagon (can you say BACON?) but I have modified my diet so that I am eating vegetarian 4 days a week, 2 days are fish, and one day is other meats. I only allow myself one day a month for red or cured meats. Since having done that I have noticed a significant reduction in my pain and fatigue so for me that anecdotal information has helped. You will have to make your own opinions and decisions.\n\nI hope that my \"dissertation\" helps you some and that you find relief of symptoms by any means you decide to follow. \n\nOh, and one quick note, I have found that trying to explain MCTD to non-sufferers is easiest if I start out by describing it thusly: \"Take every Connective Tissue Autoimmune disease, throw them in a bag, shake vigorously, then draw out random symptoms.\" It provides a useful visual that everyone can relate to.   :) Ok, so you can have fibro with all of this then? I was not sure since the only thing not explained by this diagnosis is the trigger points.\n\nI have my own daunting list, both physical and mental.  It is good to know to watch out for the lesser known ones getting ignored, thank you. I have noticed a bit of that, but it may be because prednisone sends me manic and/or suicidal so we cannot treat everything well... we only do short tapers. I am considering trying a low dose of prednisone all the time again, but I am scared to do so, between the mental effects and the weight gain that it caused last time that upped my pain.\n\nI do a lot of research (as does my husband), and try to talk to other patients with the same conditions whenever I can. My husband and I both advocate for me, with my brain fog I find it difficult to keep track of everything, so he helps quite a lot. I do try to ask about meds from more than just the pharmacist and doctor, especially after MTX landed me in the hospital with C. Diff that tried to kill me last year.\n\nI have seen that thread in autoimmune conditions in general... meat, especially red meat, has been shown to have inflammatory agents. (I cannot think of the word I am looking for, hopefully you understand.) I need to cut back on sugar too, as it is inflammatory and I am bad about it. \n\nIt has helped, thank you. :)\n\nOh, I like that explanation! I think you are lucky you have a nephrologist in your corner at least. Do you have any plans to get yourself to a rheumatologist? I would not accept just any rheum either, a bad rheumatologist could be worse than none at all, so make sure to find one who will listen to you.\n\nHaving someone I can trust when I tell them about my symptoms really helps me deal with the mental stress that comes with this disease. Advocating for yourself, like the other poster said, is so important since symptoms can vary so widely. If you have a rheumatologist you can trust it makes it so much easier to advocate for yourself.\n\n\n My nephrologist does not have the best bedside manner, but he knows what he is talking about and I am so thankful he is there. I am still trying to get in with a rheumatologist, right now the ones in our area are not taking patients... well... as of the last time referrals were sent out, I need to ask to be referred again.\n\nI miss the last rheumatologist I had, he was amazing, but he retired at around the time we moved out of state. Sounds like a nightmare. I take it you are in the USA? If there is one thing I am happy about is that I started having symptoms after I moved to a country with universal healthcare. I cannot imagine handling this in the US, though many are able to. Good luck with getting into seeing a rheumatologist! I hope you do not have to wait long. Do u mean your \"neurologist\" diagnosed u? I do not believe I have heard of a nephrologist; and there is nephology, ...but it is the study of clouds\u2601\ufe0f. No, I mean my NEPHrologist, who studies kidneys. \n\nA nephrologist is a medical doctor who specializes in kidney care and treating diseases of the kidneys. The term nephrologist comes from the Greek word \u201cnephros\u201d, which means kidney or renal and \u201cologist\u201d refers to someone who studies.   ", "So I had to ask my GP to stop shouting ... So, I have been waiting for a long time to see a rheumatologist. My gastroenterologist referred me originally given my gastroparesis and various other symptoms seems suspicious. After waiting a long time, I called the rheumatologist and was advised by their office that I was considered so low importance that they will not be seeing me anytime soon but if I needed help I could ask my GP for a letter telling them my situation has worsened and they could reevaluate the urgency.\n\nGiven how long I would been waiting, I got my GP to run the autoimmune array of blood tests hoping something obvious would pop up that could speed things along. Sadly, it came back with nothing much because of course it did. No easy answers for me.\n\nSo today I tried to get my GP to write that letter and she became very difficult. She said because my blood tests did not show anything it would make her look stupid. Bitch already looks stupid.\n\nEvery time I tried to explain my reasons and how the various different symptoms I have had for many years point to something underlying, she would talk over me louder and louder. Every question she asked me, she would cut me off before I would given a full answer until I had to ask her to stop shouting. It was very hard not to lose my temper, I rarely do but damn did I get close.\n\nSo yeah, feeling very frustrated right now. You can pick basically any auto-immune disease you want, I have half the symptoms of it and no doctor has ever been able to explain to me why. I just want to know what is wrong with me.\n\nI got the referral letter but I need a new GP. It is frustrating enough to feel so randomly crappy and ineffective, but then we have to deal w the demoralizing responses from lab-driven docs.  I finally got my DNA tested and it shows elevated DS-DNA and RNP (still neg ANA) x3 labs over last 10mos.  Two separate diagnoses since.  A meriad of seemingly disconnected health issues/hospitalizations over 10y+.  Hang in there and know you are not crazy.

Any tips really would be great thanks Have you been given medication? That is the best way to get the condition under control long term. \n\nStress can be a huge trigger so trying to keep that under control is always good. Just generally trying to keep yourself as healthy as possible if probably the best thing to do. I was diagnosed 6 years ago. Everyone progression is different but diet, exercise(sometimes  I waddle around so slow it is hard to detect my movement with the naked eye)and sticking to your medication schedule really does help. I know this because I have done the opposite of this and felt very bad! Try not to worry too much. \u2665\ufe0f The hardest part is going to be worrying too much.i try to keep a tight schedule but with chances of pneumothorax. \nI can only do super light weight when lifting.  I might have to pick up cycling It is really hard to adjust to the new normal. I found it really difficult to learn to pace myself. I walk every day. Some days a few miles and some I just shuffle around. Take it slow. We cannot control what is going to happen, all we can do is try to take things as they come.", "Discussion: What is your most common symptom and how have you been managing it? Finding pain and symptom management can be tricky especially when there are several symptoms to address. What is your most annoying, constant, or dominant symptom and how do you manage it? My muscle pain is the absolute worst thing and I feel like the past 2-3 weeks have been one really long, really intense flare. I am on methotrexate but I am guessing it is not really something that can have a big impact on flares. Luckily I have a doc appointment soon so we can talk about other things to do because man, it is been hellish. I know what you mean, hang in there! For me it is a toss up between photosensitivity and muscle pain/weakness. The photosensitivity is managed with high SPF sunscreen, wearing ridiculous layers of clothing and wrap around sun glasses (although it is mostly easier to be nocturnal at this point.)\nThe muscle inflammation is manageable thanks to hydroxychloroquine, naproxen, glucosamine and pacing exercises. I was referred to a CFS specialist nurse who had previously worked with one of my rheumatologists so she helped me build up enough stamina to manage basic exercises. Keeping my muscles moving really helps. I had physio on my rotator cuff last year and I was lucky enough to have a recently graduated physio who was really into the chronic pain elements of her training. She explained the importance of stretching your muscles because it improves blood flow to the muscles and helps them regenerate. For me it is horrendous shoulder pain every day - there are other things of course but this is the most persistent and painful. It was my first symptom, along with reynauds and hand swelling etc. In the mornings I cannot move my arms or hands without a long hot shower. My partner has to help dress me. I generally cannot put any weight through my arms so getting down onto the ground and up again is an ordeal, as is carrying things!\n\nI find that exercise along with the usual meds help (methotrexate, hydrochloroquine, celebrex). I keep lifting weights (after a long warm up) and stretching which gives some respite. Physio is amazing. I essentially treat the shoulder pain like a permanent injury. PSA: I have not gotten an official MCTD diagnosis yet (seeing an rheumatologist next month, let us hope I get answers), but I tested positive for ANA and RNP antibodies so I am assuming this is what it is, or maybe lupus. \nFor me, it is the overwhelming and debilitating fatigue. Without my medication, I cannot function properly at all. I will be asleep for 18+ hours of the day. I have ADHD and I am prescribed adderall for it, but at this point it is purely to treat my sleepiness. Even with my meds, I have to sleep at least 10 hours a night to feel relatively okay. It is so overwhelming that before I got referred to a rheumatologist and started looking into autoimmune diseases, I never even noticed the other things that were wrong- minor joint and muscle pain, constant low grade fever, tremors. The fatigue is all-consuming. That fatigue sounds awful. It steals your life. Many people report that hydrochloroquine helps a lot with fatigue so hopefully you get diagnosed soon and get prescribed the meds you need :( Mine is the fatigue. When I first got sick and was doing the whole psychosomatic run around my psychiatrist was  convinced I had narcolepsy because I would fall asleep in the waiting room even if I was only there 5 minutes and tell her how I had to pull over my car on the highway all the time cuz I would just feel myself passing out. I really could not stay awake in my classes and I would have to just lay down on a bench on campus all the time. Even before things got bad I did not even realize I had changed my life around my excessive sleep. I got into banking because I knew I would be home around 4pm which is when I typically crash for the day. I sleep like 9-10hrs a night and still cannot function in the mornings. Thank you!! \u2665 Oh man, the photosensitivity is rough for sure. I always feel like a fool going out with long sleeves and pants in the summer (on those rare times that I do go outside at all, lol). \n\nDo you have a CFS diagnosis as well or was that just the nurse's specialty? Either way it seems like she is a great addition to your care team, I am glad you have her! I also have ADHD and was on Adderall for a very long time before being diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease. I have to say that one of the most important things I have done for my fatigue has actually been to get off the Adderall. I was having a very similar experience to yours, and it turns out the Adderall was just keeping me overactivated, even though I felt no good effects from the Adderall anymore. It was exactly like you said: a bare minimum way to keep away the all-encompassing fatigue. I have been off the Adderall for three months, and started taking Plaquenil one month ago. Every body is so different, but I have to say, I think the Plaquenil has already helped so much with the fatigue. I hope you get relief soon!!! I am glad your fatigue is better, that is great! It is so nice hearing from people who actually understand what that kind of fatigue feels like. I would love to be off of Adderall one day. I am really hoping I can get diagnosed soon and then get medication to treat whatever it is that I have, and then hopefully I will not need Adderall anymore. As a full-time college student, though, I do not think I would be able to stop taking it until I get another medication to help me, because I would be asleep all day, every day, and I would fall behind on all my work. But yeah, getting off of Adderall is a huge goal of mine. Especially since I really want kids one day, and you cannot take it while pregnant or breastfeeding. And in general I would like to not be taking a legal dose of meth every day for the rest of my life, lol. All of that makes so much sense. I have actually had to take a medical leave of absence, since I am a grad student, because of these issues. That is awful, I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to get back on your feet soon! When I was referred to the CFS team, my GP decided to send me to them, neurology and endocrinology as well as rheumatology. I think I got lucky that the nurse had worked with one of my rheumatologists and she found me interesting lol\nWhether or not I have CFS depends on which doctor you ask. My GP says yes, one rheumatologist says probably and the other one says that it comes under the umbrella of MCTD.\n\nI prefer to think of it as I suffer with fatigue as part of my chronic illness, I do not suffer from Chronic Fatigue. \nIt is something I really wish was not in my medical history because there is such a stigma attached to it, so I think I perform some interesting mental gymnastics to distance myself from it.", "What are your symptoms.... And how have they changed over time? I will start! I had a bout of mycoplasma pneumonia that affected both lungs when I was 21. A few months after that the Reynaud\u2019s started, then about 4 months after that, joint pain. I have been receiving treatment for GERD since I was a teenager.\n\nI am lucky that I was diagnosed within a month of the joint pain settling in. It is been 5 years since then and my symptoms have remained more or less the same, with the addition of osteopenia and an SLE diagnosis on top of that. Every so often I get an incidence of pericarditis but I have had it maybe twice in the past three years. I have got a great doctor that listens to my concerns and does not make me feel like a hypochondriac. All in all I feel pretty lucky even if fatigue means I am less active than I would like to be. I have had weird little joint problems since I was young. Bad knees and TMJ in middle school that have been fine since. My hips flared up a bunch for a couple of years when I was 18-20. Sometimes I got reynaud\u2019s symptoms but not always. Once I randomly went in the sun for 3 minutes and got HORRIBLE sunburn all over my body. I had constant dull hand pain for several years that sometimes flared so bad I could not turn door knobs with one hand... that is when they did a buncha tests, had a positive ANA and hesitantly diagnosed me with MCTD. I would always get a malar rash a couple of days before my hands got crazy bad. The pain stopped almost entirely when I went strictly gluten free although I am not celiac. Then I start carefully lifting weights and my collar bones both pop \u201cout\u201d it is called AC joint separation. Went to a personal trainer and he helped me fix this and protect the joints and I love lifting so much. Found out last year I flare super bad when I have plant lights on in my house! I am 32 and am pretty much fine now but I catch every bug that ever goes around and I get fatigue flares pretty frequently. I definitely get worse when I decide to eat bread for awhile I think maybe it is the chemicals they spray on wheat in the US. Sorry this is very long but there is just so much weird crap about this mysterious condition! Take care of yourself and good luck Bad joint issues all my life, hypermobility in my knees causing them both to dislocate at times.\n\nOver developed calf muscles likely due to this and tight hamstrings and clawing of the toes.\n\nI have always just ached all over, I assumed it was normal.\n\nWhen I hit 33? out of nowhere I developed Raynauds (beforehand I used to be the sort of person who would be able to make a snowman barehanded and never get cold)\n\nWithin the next year... The skin on my hands and fingers started to harden and split all over causing extreme pain with mechanics hands.\n\nI had a heart attack caused by inflammation of the heart and the surrounding tissue, echo, x-rays, MRI, ECG, bloods and angiogram all proved that I have no heart issue, bad cholesterol or anything like that.\n\nMy hands started to lose range of movement, become a strange mix of incredibly painful and numb a lot of the time which would vary. Sometimes visibly swollen joints and wrists with intense nerve pain or totally dead. Currently they think a mixture between carpal tunnel and arthritic pain. I cannot do many of things I used to be able to do anymore.\n\nI have bouts of extreme foggy mindedness or extreme tiredness.\n\nAt one point I developed out of nowhere an extreme fever, became delirious and began to vomit blood. \n\nThey have found inflammation scarring down my oesophagus and throughout my stomach.\n\nI think there is probably a few things I have missed out too...\n\nDue to random blood tests and results that have been a bit all over the place but negative for a few specific things they have settled on MCTD at the moment.\n\nCurrently taking Hydroxychloroquine, I have not really noticed any help with it... But maybe it is subtle and my hands would be worse without it? I was meant to start on Methotrexate a few months ago but that was delayed due to Covid.\n\nPrednisolone has been very helpful in the past when I had super severe flare-ups which caused 24/7 extreme pain and loss of all movement in my hands.  In my first year I had:\n Irregular menses and very painful. \n Mono-like symptoms. \n Acne. \n Migraines. \n Aches. \n Exhaustion. \n Hip bursitis. \n Salivary gland pain. \n Raynaud\u2019s. \n\nIn the second year I had some of the same plus:\n Raynaud\u2019s. \n Salivary gland pain. \n Hair loss. \n Panic attacks and depression. \n Cloudy mind. \n Hip bursitis. \n Chest pain (bursitis?). \n Lower back pain (bursitis?). \n TMJ. \n Migraines. \n Toothaches. \n Exhaustion. \n Arthritis in hands/jaw/shoulders. \n Skin rashes. \n Sensitive to sun. \n Random swelling on eyes and lips sometimes. \n Probably some others I forgot. \n\nAll in all, I was trying to be positive over the last year about eating well and taking care of myself in order to feel better but now considering Plaquenil since day to day can be tough. Especially not knowing how I will feel when I wake up in the morning. *Hope this was not a downer but I wanted to provide the details in case it helps anyone. I also have a lot of amazing and positive things going on in my life too! It is not all bad :)* At the moment poly-arthritis and swollen fingers only in the AM. I am fortunate that aggressive treatment a year or so ago put me in a good spot . My ANA Titer went from 1:1280 in 2017  to 1:40 last month . \n\nI used to have reynauds , GERD, brain fog / fatigue and constant swelling / popping on tendons . Can I ask what you did to improve so much? 2 Rituximab infusions + mycophenolate was the game changer for me . I am having some symptoms creep up so going back on rituximab in the next few months. You only had two do two infusions to see a difference? I am in Japan and they are very conservative with their treatments so I do not know how bad I would have to be before they offered that to me. My Dr. had to convince my insurance to allow it by diagnosing me with RA and letting them know MTX and Arava raised my liver enzymes . The infusion also involved a high dose IV dexamethasone. The combo of that and Mycophenolate has me in a good spot thankfully. I am US based in the NYC area . Wow, seems like a very diverse group!\n\nOne very unspecific neurological symptom started 2015, when two fingers on the right side would feel oddly numb and tingly. At the neurologist in 2016, it showed that the whole side was somehow a bit less sensitive to pressure. But they could not find what caused it.\n\nIBS (self-diagnosis) since end of 2016, has only improved after a coloscopy in September 2019 (all hail the laxative cleanse ;P )\n\nStrange stuff started in 2017 with random bouts of half-weeks of weakness and strong fatigue. I have had fatigue issues with untreated Hashimoto's before but at that time, I was taking care I would stay perfectly euthyroid. I would also get random tendonitis.\n\nIn summer 2019, I started getting joint pain in my fingers, wrists, ankles and knees but no redness and no visible swelling. I also had puffy fingers but was mostly ignoring that. I started having to burp frequently, especially when lying down, later to be diagnosed as silent reflux. My ribcage would make strange rubbing noises - but I do not have an answer to that one yet. I did notice to have cold hands and feet before, but the first instance of me actually seeing my fingers turn white and blue was in September 2019. Muscle aches also started getting more frequent around there.\n\nI was also noticing to be short of breath, but only in April 2020, I was confirmed to have a diminished diffusion capacity in my lungs (66 %). Around then, hip and back pain joined in with the other pain types.\n\nSo basically, I did lose a lot of my energy and cannot strain myself much physically. Basically, everyday, I am in pain and aware of it, but only rarely is it so bad that I have to take pain meds to not be way too distracted to do mild physical and mental work (working part-time on my PhD). I am still mobile and can do most stuff - if sometimes a bit more slowly. I am still worried if I could be able to keep up with a stressful full-time job, though. And I am still wary of the lung stuff - I already pushed for that and it is getting looked into. I feel like I closely related to your story. A lot of symptom similarities but over a shorter time span I think. I also am worried about going back to a full time job. I am currently on disability but do not think I will be able to get Long term disability and I know I will not be able to return to the career I once had. I had planned on going back to school within the next year to get my PhD but when Covid hit that changed things. How are you balancing school and your health? What is your PhD in, if you do not mind me asking? Yeah, I can also super relate to your description.\nDepression also hit me around 2018. But after accommodations (a whole month off, my boss caring more, making me decide what to do now; psyhotherapy and SSRIs to be able to go into work without the anxiety from the depression) were already making me feel much better in summer/fall 2019, I am not too sure how closely it is tied to MCTD.\n\nI am in analytical chemistry. Because I am only employed for 5 hours a day and I am not able to do teaching on the side (sooo sad for that ;____; I am not at Uni), it comes down to around 6 hours work a day of lab and office work. I can work longer but usually, my legs start hurting like an alarm after too much office work :D .\n\nI found it nice to start the day with a cup of a hot drink at work in the morning. In the lab, I sit down when I can and have breaks as needed. When I hurt too much for the lab, I do office work instead. But like I said, I am pretty free in my workplace. And no one there knows of my disease.\nOther chemists frequently speak of rules like \"you do not get to leave earlier than your boss\". But the most important thing: Do something you love in your PhD. Seriously. Do not settle for something you know will not tease you and keep you interested for at least 3 years. I cannot eat wheat. I am not sure if it is gluten or something else (e.g. amylase-trypsin inhibitors). I know it is not FODMAPs because I can eat beans without too much trouble.  Wheat does not instantly make me sick, but it has more of a cumulative effect that is very significant over time.  I will not knowingly eat wheat, and even regular oats seem to cause trouble.  Gluten-free oats treat me fine.", "Does anyone else\u2019s bug bites get extremely swollen now? Ever since my illness got bad now it is like my immune system will take any opportunity to overreact. My tiny bug bites become extremely inflamed. Curious if anyone else has had something similar. It is not too bothersome but super weird. Yeah...I notice it especially with mosquito bites; they get about dime-sized, turn purple and are raised/swollen. It looks atrocious if I have the misfortune of having more than one in the same general area. I used to, but it stopped when I got on Plaquenil. It was so weird! I used to get gigantic welts. Yes!!! Ughhhh and they stay on my body for weeks. Yes! Quarter-size welts from mosquitoes. I had a bee sting a few years ago, and the welt took up half of my forearm. Same. I used to get huge welts, the size of a half dollar, and they took weeks to heal. Also on Plaquenil now.", "Can someone tell me what RNP level has to be to be considered positive for MCTD? I tested + for ANA (1:320; speckled) but am negative on all other antibodies except RNP. I have tested + twice at 1.7 &amp; 1.9 but my Rheumatologist said it is not MCTD bc RNP has to be higher (8 or above). I cannot find any literature that says what MCTD diagnosis guidelines are w/ specifics re: test levels. Can anyone help? It probably depends on the specific test used and that test\u2019s threshold for a positive. \n\nThe one that the Cleveland Clinic used, positive is anything over 1. Mine was \u201cvery high\u201d at 6.8. I had higher than 8 but lab tests are not diagnostic. Only confirmation based off clinical symptoms. My RNP is 1.6 and I was diagnosed bc I have symptoms. From what my rheumatologist explained, most people with MCTD have higher than 8 on their blood work, but having lower does not mean you do not have it. It all depends on if you are showing symptoms. Did your rheumatologist give you any sort of diagnosis at all? I was also just looking for this info. Mine is 1.6 and 1.4. I was turned away by 2 rheumatologists as \u201cnormal\u201d. I do not have many symptoms, but I did have scalp burning and hair loss that started, and was diagnosed with celiac. So I went to see a new rheum and she diagnosed me with MCTD and gave me plaquinil to try.  I have not started it yet, but I have seen a few others in this thread that are in the same position. It could just be that we caught it early or only have mild disease, but it is hard to tell because it is a diagnosis of occlusion. Sorry I do not have a straight forward answer for you. Be persistent if you feel something is wrong!\n\nEdit: my labs say anything over 1 is high just fyi, but I understand we are both on the cusp of that. my lab's range said 1-20 was normal/negative and my results have gone over 300 before. if your lab says an 8 or above is positive only, then that is what your rheum says, every lab is different, and asking other ppls labs ranges is not going to help or change your results. it is about how they do their own measurements.\n\nETA my RNP was measured differently i think but still my point stands lol I was tested twice for RNP antibodies. The lab that ran my tests consider a positive result as anything over 25. My results were 29 and 127. I was told since my ANA was normal and my RNP results were inconsistent, that my RNP results were no good and dismissed. I have had progressive weakness, twitching, tingling, numbness, joint pain, fatigue, etc. for over 2 years. I also have hashimotos and small fiber neuropathy. I am not sure if every rheumatologist uses the same qualifications to diagnose MCTD but the lab should provide the a results scale with your lab report to help you distinguish negative from positive results. I do not think there is a specific threshold. My highest RNP ever was 2.3 but usually it was much lower and I still got a diagnosis because of my symptoms. However, that was from my 5th rheumatologist. The previous 4 told me there was nothing wrong with me. No. Mine was 1.7 &amp; I am having symptoms (originally thought I had lupus but that test was negative). They will not give me any diagnosis but said they could prescribe hydroxychloroquine. Thank you!! Yes, sounds like we are in exact same situation! Thank you. Crazy how just getting a diagnosis is such a process. Thank you Mine was 1.5, with only a rash on my legs. I have a whole post about my dx ( She did a follow-up blood draw, but no RNP was assessed. Not sure why she would not want to see a trend? I feel so disheartened. I just got out of a rheum visit today and she said she would not consider my elevated RNP and Smith antibodies and Speckled ANA to be anything but a false positive from a medication I might be taking. I am hoping a new rheum might have other thoughts. Ugh that is so annoying. I do not know why it is so controversial so diagnose someone with something they have the symptoms of and tests that confirm it. Do not take it personally and do not doubt yourself. Can I ask though, what is the end result you are trying to get? A diagnosis or just to feel better? I went to a naturopath who has helped me far more than any rheumatologist and I was able to stop taking all of the horrible drugs I had been prescribed for MCTD. Would  definitely recommend seeing someone with a more holistic big picture approach. Just to feel better. I even asked about life style changes, dietary changes, or suggestions and she just told me to try an academic center or another rheumatology clinic that there was nothing she could do for me. I am so sorry :( I had one tell me that diet had no impact on my symptoms. I see a naturopath now and went gluten and dairy free and my symptoms massively improved!", "Celebrating my CBC improvement! Only abs lymphocytes are out of range  I got my latest results, decided to chart my cbc results and I feel like they are better! My CMP, C reactive protein were also all normal. I graduated from grad school in May, so I have had better sleep since. I think that is helping me get better. Congrats on finishing grad school!", "Positive ANA and high A/G levels Hi, I am experiencing hairless which just made me go through a slew of tests. I tested positive ANA Screen by IFA, and 1:320 Tier ANA Homogenous. I am afraid that I have lupus or MCTD. Autoimmune disorders run in my family (mother has rheumatoid arthritis, my father had antiphospholipid syndrome and died due to complications). I also was flagged for a high A/G ratio (meaning that I am having kidney or liver issues).\n\nI am only 28 and a mom.\n\nI am really scared you guys. I do not know the life expectancy for this.Is it possible for kidneys to improve? And do I have a chance at a normal life? I had a couple of blood tests that showed issues with my liver and kidneys. My blood work has been fine for around 18 months now. \nI know it is scary, especially given your family history but it is not a death sentence. There are lots of medications that can control your symptoms and keep your disease activity low. Some people manage periods of remission. I cannot think of their name, but there is one user on this sub who has lived with MCTD for decades. \n\nDo not lose hope, especially when you do not have an official diagnosis yet. Thank you. I appreciate you. Hi, I am new to this sub, are you ok? Did you find out any news? I went to a rheumatologist and everything is looking normal besides my ANA tests. He said it could be the beginning of lupus or it could be nothing. We just have to wait and see", "Hi guys. Room for one more?  Inability to get any life insurance due to MCTD while concurrently unable to get SSDI because MCTD is not \"life threatening\" or \"immediate\".", "New to the diagnosis Got diagnosed last fall (I am 28f) and was pretty relieved honestly to put a name to all these symptoms. I am waiting on specialist appointments at the moment but I am very dizzy, off balance, short of breath and my joints are pretty much screaming 24/7 since mid January. I was on hydroxychloroquin for a month starting in December but it made me dizzy and nauseous so I stopped. What are some self care things I can do while I wait for my appointments? \n\nI am already resting a lot, taking vitamin b complex, c, omega3, magnesium and turmeric with black pepper. and sleeping 10+ hours a day. My anemia is actually under control right now between b-12 shots and iron infusions. I have medical marijuana for pain but I do not want to take it while I am working cause it can really make me non functioning. Is there a particular strain you have found that is enough to cut through the pain but not so strong that you cannot do computer work from home? Try Wim hof method (YouTube: Peterson Wim hof). Helped me definitely For Tiredness ldn. I just read this today...instead of saying \u201cwhy am I so tired?\u201d Say, \u201cwhy does my body need rest?\u201d  MCTD patients need to conserve energy for what is necessary. That is why the story about \u201cspoons\u201d is important.  Saving spoons means saving your energy.   Before you say yes to anything, ask yourself if it is necessary, or should you save energy. That is my main tip What dose of hydroxychloroquine did you start on? I had to halve my dose until I built up a tolerance to it (nausea, dizziness, hypoglycemia etc) which took around a month. \n\nThere are exercises you can do to help with the dizziness. My sister in law saw a physio who had her balance on a cushion with her eyes shut. I am sure if you search for them, they will show up on Google. \n\nGlucosamine has helped with my joints. You could try adding in vitamin d, too. \n\nKeeping track of your symptoms can help you and your doctor spot patterns and triggers, so it may be worth doing that.  I use Bearable (r/BearableApp) but there are other apps available. I love this. Thanks! I like this one better than my other pain tracker app. I will talk to my doctor about the hydroxy and doing half dose. For sure take vitamin d.  There is decent evidence that it helps, and its harmful dosage per therapeutic dosage is high so you can take it without much concern about side effects. I stopped eating gluten and drastically reduced dizziness, vertigo, and other craptastic symptoms. I do not claim this would work for anyone, but it sure helped me.", "Raynauds experiences Hi everyone. I have been dealing with some mysterious issues for a couple years now. Latest bloodwork has shown a positive ANA and high RNP, so naturally I googled and ended up with my own self diagnosis. Rheum has not gotten back to me yet about my results to officially diagnose me. \n\nI did wonder if everyone is raynauds is what the pictures look like on the internet. Full purple or white digits with hard lines separating them. I was not sure if those images are just an extreme of what raynauds looked like. \n\nI was getting little round spots that seemed like blood blisters on my toes. Doctors thought blood clots but have been pretty perplexed. Was not sure if others have had same or similar circumstances with their raynauds. Research purpura vs petechia.  Also look into chilblains; they can sometimes cause raised spots that resemble blood blisters a little. I get chilblains with my reynauds, and a lot of swelling in my right hand. I do sometimes get a white finger that does appear just as you have seen it in photos, but other times my attacks \"merely\" turn my fingers blue or purplish and numb for a while. ( I have finger infections too. Mine go quickly from red to blue to white and the pictures online are pretty accurate from my point of view. It is pretty dramatic and you know if you have it. It can be painful too, especially when the blood starts flowing back in as you warm your fingers and toes.", "Am I going to die? I am a 21 year old female, recently diagnosed with MCTD and myositis. Very bad joint pain in hands and feet... only muscle weakness is in my thighs but everywhere else feels okay.\n\nDoctor started me on methotrexate and folic acid. No relief so far, but I have only been on it 3 weeks. No side effects either that others complain about (at least so far).\n\nAm I going to die from this? How long do I have left? I come onto this sub and the first post I see is titled \u201cnot dead yet\u201d and that made me very scared. My biggest symptom is joint pain and chest pain (but only with deep breaths and this comes and goes). And yes, I know people on Reddit cannot actually tell me how long I have left, but what I am saying is that I am wondering if I only have a few years left? No, you are not, not from MCTD.  I am 71, and I are not dead yet.  Read some of my other posts in this community.  It sounds like you have got a good doc. I am really sorry you are feeling so awful. I know 3 weeks is still a long time to to feel so much pain, and of course, the suffering you have done before that. But in the grand scheme of medication and treatments... it is not very long. You WILL feel better. Hopefully from the regimen you are on now, but maybe it will take some tweaking. \nI felt like I was absolutely doomed to invalidity, pain, and death too, but I have been finding treatments that work for me, and I am doing so much better. There may be no cure, but there is hope, and there will better times! The key things to have looked at are your lungs, heart/pulmonary arteries. Interstitial lung disease is the most significant cause of mortality in MCTD patients. Good news though! We are treatable. I am on Cellcept after trying methotrexate. I am doing a lot better. There is no expiration date on us. There is a fabulous MCTD group on FB. We can live a long time. Just make sure to manage your disease. It is very unlikely to die of MCTD, MCTD gets dangerous in approximately 1/3 of cases with organ involvement - generally heart, lung or kidney. \n\nObviously it is very important to keep up on your medical appointments, exams, treatments, etc. as you get older (fwiw, I am 49 and have been on this journey about 20 years). \n\nStay active as long as you can, even if it is things like walks, aqua aerobics, etc. No, you are not. There is no reason that you will not live as long as anyone who does not have MCTD. \n\nYou have started treatment, you are young and you have everything going for you. \n\nIt is scary, I know. I was so terrified that my GP had to prescribe me sleeping pills because I was convinced I was going to die. Your life may not go exactly how you would planned, but there is no reason you cannot achieve amazing things and be happy. \n\nPlease hang on to the fact that there are people with MCTD who manage to go into remission. \n\nPlease think about accessing mental health support to help you adjust. Once you have made peace with having an autoimmune disease, you will be amazed by how much better you can feel purely because you are not full of anxiety. I was diagnosed less than 2 years ago- so I remember having the same worry, and the pain. Like the others have said it is treatable and you are not likely to die because of it. Right now you are in the suckiest part, when they find the right meds to help you. I think the \u201cnot dead yet\u201d post was a little tongue in cheek- humor is how many of us dead with pain in general. \n\nIt is scary, but it is treatable. My goal is remission and I feel like I am close. At it is worse I could not open bottles, get up unassisted off of the floor because my joints felt like glass. I used to run and do slack lining and trapeze- so this was a big shift for me. I am back to walking my 5k course, my hands are fine 90% of the time and I am working my way back to the fun stuff.\n\nThe best tip I was told is \u201cif pain/discomfort is affecting your ability to work, tell the doctor\u201d. Like I had to stop typing and take breaks during the day because my hands HURT, but I would just tell the doc about my hands hurting and went through a few wasted visits like that. Once I mentioned it affecting work, that made them pay attention and try new meds. What is the name of the Facebook group? I would love to join. Yes what is the name of the group please", "Hydroxychloroquine side effects? Sorry for the question my anxiety is always looking at the side effects and i get worried.\n\nThey are getting me off leflunomide due to a rise in my liver enzymes. I am also on methylprednisolone 4 mg twice a day.\n\nI feel like leflunomide helped a lot what is everyone is experience with hydroxychloroquine I have been on Plaquenil for 6 years. I was concerned about the side effects and let it sit in my cabinet for a while before I started it. After a while I decided the benefits were worth the risk of complications. It takes a few months to take effect I would say I started to notice a difference in 2 to 3 months. It did make me nauseous at 1st so I took it at night. I get my retina scanned every 6 months. It is benefited me greatly with no side effects. You can look at something on your phone called an amsler grid, if the lines become wavy you stop taking it and call your doctor.  The benefits have definitely outweighed outweighed the risk for the rare side effects. I am a little surprised your doctor did not look at the Methyl prednisone  as being the cause for your elevated liver enzymes.  It helps a lot but can be really rough on your body when it comes to long term use. I hope this helps. I wish you the best. I had really good results with hydroxychloroquine for a few years but after they discovered damage occurring to my eyes, I had to stop. Truthfully, I do not regret taking it. The benefits for those years was worth the very minimal damage. Of course if I had stayed on it, my eyes would have gotten a lot worse. Do not skip the eye exams and lab work I had read it causes heart issues , but i guess it is more inclined to retina issues That is what I thought that the methylprednisolone was the one going to get cut off but they dropped it to once a day I have been on hydroxychloroquine for many years with zero noticeable side effects Thank you, that should keep me more at ease how often do you take it? 200 mg twice a day Same for me", "Adjusting to MCTD First post here, hello, sorry if I am scatter brained. My brain does not work anymore. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI am trying so hard to stop smoking cigarettes, but it is SOOO HARD and I know it makes all of the connective tissue disease shit so much worse. I am 26 y/o female who is had type 1 diabetes since I was 5, and the last two years my pain problems have left me unemployed due to the severity. We went from thinking it was stress, to thinking it was endometriosis, to thinking it was pelvic floor dysfunction, to thinking it was interstitial cystitis, to realizing oh okay this is definitely rheumatic. I have tested positive for ANA twice, positive for RNP once. My Lupus AVISE test came back negative. I am negative for all the other connective tissue markers too - except I tested insanely high positive for the pr3 ANCA (which is apparently really bad) \n\nI have never posted here as I know the activity seems pretty scarce and the community is small compared to others. But can anyone offer me any lifestyle advice? I am taking a shit ton of supplements and idk what I actually need, it is just what I assumed I needed. I see my rheumatologist again on the 25th for hopefully an official diagnosis (all of my other doctors have unofficially diagnosed it) \n\nWhat supplements do you guys take aside from prescription meds? Has anyone\u2019s esophagus been affected? Am I going to fucking die from this anytime soon? I am terrified and my rheumatologist office never calls me back or answers the phone...and I am just scared of being alive. Please offer any help or advice you can. Hello, thank you for sharing! I used to smoke as well, and it was very tough to stop. I had a pulmonary embolism and HAD to stop. You just have remember that if you want your body to feel good then you have to give up smoking. Start gradually. If you have 8 cigarettes a day, cut down to 7 for 3 days, then to 6 for the next 3 days and so on. I was diagnosed right after my 21st birthday. Hahaha happy birthday to me. I thought it was the end of the world. I was convinced that I was going to die soon. Not true. Once you find which meds work for you and how to manage pain it is really not that bad. Sounds like you need a better dr though. From here on out you will be making drs visits more often than you used to. One of my biggest pieces of advice is to find drs that you feel truly care. Easier said than done but trust me it makes a huge difference. Also, I have gnarly GERD. Was actually hospitalized because I had a tear in my esophagus. Best advice I can give about that is pay attention to which foods make it worse. For me it is spicey and citrus... which I have, and I shit you not, cried over many times. Giving up spicey foods is the hardest fucking thing. But I have now gotten to the point where the pain is just not worth the yummy bite anymore. Smoking also makes this worse. So find which foods wrk for you and stick with it. Again, easier said than done. \n\nIf you would like to stay in Touch then DM here or on insta  I would love to be pen pals. \n\nJust know that you are not alone. As much as it feels like it you are not. Know that there will be days that you just cannot and that is okay. It is okay to be scared, it is okay to have questions, it is okay to not be 100% everyday. Just take it day by day. Each day is different. \n\nMuch love and best of luck to you. Please do not hesitate to reach out. I will look into getting some glucosamine! I see my rheum next week, and I am going to show him all the supplements I have started taking - and see which I actually need and what I do not need. I have been taking vitamin D3everyday for almost two years since I had my thyroid removed. I have also started taking vitamin b12 a month ago because I read it is good for vasculitis, which is another thing I have got. \n\nMy PCP has suggested yoga, but I have got a lot more than the MCTD issues going on - so exercise is not something I can manage at this time. Hopefully when the Plaquenil kicks in, or whatever other prescription medication I am given next week (if any) works, I can start to add that to a routine. I have not got much of a routine right now :( Thank you for this. I have done a lot of research since I developed raynauds in September. Thankfully I do have a great endocrinologist (I have had type one diabetes since I was 5) and her staff is amazing. I have got a great physical therapist, a great primary doctor, and a great nephrologist. My urologist is good. I cannot tell if my rheum is great yet since I have only seen him once so far, but next week I assume he will be referring me to cardiologist and pulmonologist as well. \n\nI have been taking nexium which has significantly helped my GERD symptoms, and I have significantly cut back on smoking. I am trying to taper off since the times I have tried to quit cold turkey have not worked. \n\nI need to find some sort of local counseling or therapy, since my insurance does not cover mental health..but I definitely do have PTSD from a traumatic event that happened several years ago that I know I need to resolve. \n\nI am active on the book of faces! I am just so scared to reach out - not just for this, but for anything - I have been isolated in my apartment and have not socialized much at all since my health got worse in May of 2019. It took weeks for me to get strength to post here. :( one day though, I will take you up on that offer. \n\nMy sister in law deals with a lot of rheumatic things and told me about the spoon theory in 2013. Unfortunately now I can relate to her using it. I try to tell my fianc\u00e9 about it, but he tends to think that \u201cgetting up, eating, exercising, and turning on all the lights\u201d is what I need when I am laying in bed writhing in pain. He does not quite get it yet, but I hope he will soon. I will most definitely look into that - I have been taking something called Dr. Tobias lung health capsules I got from Amazon. I just found out I tested positive for something called ureaplasma which ruins your urinsrh system and respiratory system, and I also have tested positive for the cANCA pr3 which goes for the respiratory system and kidneys. So much fun. \n\nMy aunt had esophageal cancer and ended up having hers removed and had to have her stomach stretched to make a new one. She can hardly eat anything and cannot lie flat anymore. She chokes easily. It is scary and sad so I am sorry you deal with that. It took me months to figure out my severe chest pain was due to my esophagus, and Nexium in the morning with a Pepcid pill before dinner has helped significantly so far. \n\nI have been on 2.5mg Amlodipine for raynauds and it has not done a thing - so I am going to bring it up at my rheumatologist visit next Thursday. \n\n\nQuitting smoking is hard. I am a very high stressed person by nature, and have been since I became cognizant. You can imagine how much worse it is gotten since I noticed my skin changing colors before my eyes. I have been in pelvic floor physical therapy for almost a year now (I have had chronic pelvic pain) and my PT is the one who said \u201cI really think you have something autoimmune going on, you need a panel done\u201d and boom, ANA came back high as hell. It is taken two years to get to that point. It is just a mess. I hope your liver issues stay in remission, I am so so sorry you had to deal with that I have definitely cut back. Sometimes now I will only smoke half of one. Ugh it is just the worst lol all of the things I enjoy that made me feel somewhat good - coffee, Zevia (the \u201chealthier\u201d diet soda, I always drink diet because of my type one diabetes, spicy food, cigarettes, alcohol occasionally. All of those are bad bad bad and giving them all up at once is like UGGGHHHHHH  \n\nI will say I barely drink soda, maybe once every few weeks. So yay? Lol I am slowly trying to be better. It is just crap. I was diagnosed around Christmas when I was 5 with type one diabetes, and this Christmas it was \u201cmerry Christmas you have lupus or MCTD\u201d so I feel that hard. \n\nI have had frequent doctor visits all my life. Frequent blood draws, frequent monitoring. But only for one thing - not 19284738284 things :(\n\nI am also anorexic - which makes eating anything hard, but when I do eat it is usually a frozen meal because cooking hurts my body too much. Ya girl needs therapy lol. But I am hoping things will look up for me. I have only gotten bad thing after bad thing CONSTANTLY for years involving my health, and I am ready to hear positive things. I know my endocrinologists have made my life with diabetes so much easier. I never thought autoimmune diseases were this bad...I guess because I was diagnosed with t1d so young, and it is second nature now. I am hoping, with the teeny baby silver spoon of hope I have left, that all of this becomes second nature to me too.  \n\nI will add you on Instagram! \nI am bad at reaching out and replying. Obviously why it took me a week to do so. \ud83d\ude02 but I always forget or am too much in my head. I am bad at keeping in touch. It is awful. Thank you for replying to me. You guys have all made me feel a little bit better. Good for you!  I LOVE my pelvic floor therapist.  She got me off pads, and I am forever grateful.  \n\nEsophageal cancer in your aunt might have been secondary to a familial autoimmune condition, so it is good you are on the omeprazole now.\n\nAbout the book of faces, they are closed groups, and you do not have to post anything.  Just join one, and lurk (read comments without posting anything).  You will either \"click\" with one or not.\n\nIf you have access to Amazon, get a used copy of \"The Body Keeps the Score\" and read it cover to cover.  Therapy will help you SO much, and EMDR is a great way to start.\n\nReynauds can be a bitch.  Are you keeping your head covered?  Most of our heat is lost through the head, so wear a hat when you can, and keep your body core warm. That helps more than trying to warm up your extremities.\n\nThen, print off the spoon story for your SO.  There is no excuse for him not understanding.  Can he go with you to your next appointment?\n\nAnd, keep on thinking of yourself as an \"ex-smoker\" rather than a failed quitter.  That is the way I did it.\n\nI would not be taking any supplements off Amazon unless I read a peer reviewed study that recommended them.  What part of the country are you in?  Are you close to any research centers?\n\nFor mental health, check into some of the online options.  Also, the Affordable Care Act just opened their enrollment window again, so go on the government website, put in  your info, and see if you qualify.  Does not cost anything, and  you do not have to sign up. Oh I still struggle with controlling what I eat. Like I said, I have cried many times about it lol. It is definitely not easy, but I do feel so much better. It will take time. Do not beat yourself and keep trying. Just keep swimming swimming swimming. And when you slip, just acknowledge it, forgive yourself, and try again. I still smoke spliffs every now and then. \n\nLol I was in the hospital a week before Xmas with that pulmonary embolism, a month after I turned 21. Merry Xmas and happy bday to me! Hahahaha trust me, I get. This shit sucks! But you have the power to make it better, believe me you really do. Therapy is probably a good idea, there are even apps for that where you can access a therapist at any time of the day and it is actually fairly priced. Or even just talking about it here. Again you can reach out to me whenever. I also battled anorexia and dysmorphia. I still struggle with dysmorphia. My relationship with food has always been rough. Also cooking can definitely take a toll. I like making crock pot meals. Easy prep, press a button and forget about it till later. Usually it will last me the week. \n\nI try to be good with reply\u2019s but suck at it sometimes so I totally get it. Life gets in the way. Do not worry about it. But really do not hesitate to reach out. I take turmeric, vitamin b complex, iron, vitamin c, sometimes a multi If I remember. and vitamin d.  I quit smoking in October and while I know it is better for my health I did not see my symptoms drastically improve... I was just joking the other day with my friend that everyone lied to me about quitting smoking and feeling better.  Do not beat yourself up about it lol!  I had ascu-laser treatment.  My friend and myself smoked for about 10 years; it worked for me but not for her.  No matter what you choose to do to quit you really have to be ready.  I went gluten free about 6 months ago, and also recently started more plant based options.  Feel like it is helping.", "Poll for the Community: How much does stress impact your symptoms? Stress is inevitable in today\u2019s world. Whether it is the endless responsibilities, work to be done, people to care for and think about, or our own health and happiness - they can all cause some amount of stress. And some amount of stress is actually healthy but our bodies are not designed to handle the amount of stress that the modern world seems to place on us. Almost all chronic autoimmune illnesses can be traced back to stress aggravation in one form or another. Some of us may even be able to witness just how much stress exacerbates our symptoms. How much does stress impact you?\n\n(  For me, my symptoms will likely flare up every month regardless of stress, but when I get into a very stressful situation or argument, my Raynaud\u2019s will actually flare up so much (even more than if I were out in the cold) that I get chilblains. After that, I tend to get very exhausted and cloudy minded. Typically the morning after a stressful situation occurs or starts, I will get really really achey and stiff. Recently had some very stressful stuff happen and now I have reached a point where I cannot even open my hand even after trying to warm it up. I have never experienced tendinitis due to RA but it is excruciating when I forget and accidentally try to pick something up with that hand.\n\nOn the other hand (no pun intended), I noticed a HUGE downshift in my exhaustion after quitting my very stressful job. Exhaustion (not the kind from lack of sleep) used to be my worst enemy and symptom back when I was working but now it is amazing that I barely feel that type of exhaustion unless I have gone through something very stressful. A lot. My back tenses up to the point moving hurts, I cannot move my head, and my wrists and ankles swell up. \n\nRaynaud's; my fingers turn really dark blue, I am physically cold and I need to cover up.\n\nSjogrens; my mouth gets really dry and it is physically impossible to eat. I have trouble swallowing and food just gets stuck, which feels like I am choking. I need to drink about half a glass of water for every bite I take (which is why I either skip meals or have some soup when I am stressed)\n\n(Edit for format) I am not entirely sure because most of the fatigue flares are monthly, no matter what.\n\nI have the impression that bad stress (like, really bad with intensive worrying and maybe overworking) leads to more pain for a while (\"pain flare\"). But I did not prove it empirically yet, so do not want to guess on the poll.", "Swollen tongue and inside lips? Has anyone here had a swollen tongue and inner lips? Could this possibly be related to mctd? I keep getting bounced around to different doctors and no one can tell me what it is. It is been ongoing for about 1.5 years now and GP just says I may never get a good answer. Ugh that cannot be right?! It is usually manageable but sometimes when it is really bad I start to panic that I cannot breathe and I sometimes have trouble chewing food without my teeth hitting the sides of the tongue. Thanks for any thoughts (side note: long story for another time on my autoimmune situation - seeing a new rheumie soon hopefully will have more definitive answer) If you can get to the Mayo Clinic, I would recommend My tongue occasionally swells slightly so that it rubs against my molars and my bottom lip definitely looks puffier when I have a mouth sore. \nIt can be linked to MCTD, but it could also be the result of lots of other autoimmune conditions. \n\nYour GP is right, although I think they could have phrased it more tactfully. It is not that you will never get answers, but it can take a really long time. \nYou will see from people's experiences here that it can take years of symptoms building up or multiple blood tests over a long period of time before your rheumatologist gets a clear enough picture of what is going on to give you a solid diagnosis. I definitely get random swelling. Sometimes it will be over my eye, my lip (as if I have a fat lip), and yes my tongue. My tongue now always has scalloped edges (indents from your teeth usually due to swelling in your tongue). I have not had breathing troubles though it does make it a bit uncomfortable usually in the morning. Before I realized my tongue was swollen I (my boyfriend actually) noticed that I would push out my lower jaw in the morning. I realized that I think it helps me breathe when I have a swollen tongue lol. Unfortunately, the act of doing so worsened my TMJ. Anyway, I feel you and it is likely due to your MCTD but good to keep an eye on. My rheum did not seem too concerned.", "The face rash. Hey there first time posting and I was just diagnosed this aug but I have been dealing with it for a long time currently having a flare up. The meds I am on manage the pain but not the rash any tips or suggestions? Have you started treatment? Given time, some people find hydroxychloroquine can make it less prominent.\nYour doctor can prescribe creams or refer you to a dermatologist if it is a real problem.\nStaying out of the sun is really important.\n\n( from Lupus UK is helpful. I have not started any treatment yet, and I know most face creams likly wont help, and I have tried finding creams online to ask for from my dr( his a lazy dr I have to do all the leg work) but I will take a look into 5that thank  thank tou very much! If your doctor is not helpful, push for a referral to dermatology. I have been waiting for my appointment for months but both my rheumatologist and GP say they would prefer a specialist handles my skin.\nYou could try a hydrocortisone cream which can either be prescribed by your GP or you can buy it at a pharmacy. It does not do much for my face but it helps my arms. I found a part of a hospital that specializes in what we have and I am going to see if my dr can get me in there only issue is it is in another city and I dont drive but I am hoping if i get an appointment i will be able to find a ride. I will differently ask about the dermatologist and hoping there is one in my city  ! I love the lavender facial spray by Mario Badescu. I have found it at Ulta, but it is available lots of places. There is a small travel size one that is good if you just want to try it. I think I have \\*just\\* started showing this as a symptom (after dealing with mild MCTD symptoms for years), and if this is possible... I think it may have been brought on by eating too many eggs. :\\\\ Have you changed your diet/medications at all lately?  \n\n\\*\\*This is just my hypothesis right now, if anyone more knowledgable would like to chime in and completely negate my theory, please feel free. I have, I went dirty keto, not only did iy help with the weight loss, it helped me realize that gluten is terrble for my tummy, which could have been causing the rash from my research.  Its hard as fuck to go keto and it may not work for everyone. I would recommend doing hard core research and talk to your doctor first too. Hope it helps, my face has not been that bad since and I am thankful for it   best of luck. I would ask your doctor to test your blood, ill see if I can find the name of the test, I live in Canada so blood work is free for me. But inbox me if you would like can I can share my thoughts with you", "Vaccine Update I just finished my latest Rheumy visit, and wanted to report my vaccine info.

CRP 23.8, sed rate 43 I have had both of mine too and no adverse reactions For your booster, did you stick with the same vaccine you got for your first two doses? Same\u2026Pfizer Thank you. I also had the Pfizer for the first two doses and I have been debating on taking the Moderna booster, but I think I will stick with Pfizer since I want to have the flu shot at the same time. I am hoping it goes smoothly for you.", "Concerned about Misdiagnosis Hello everyone! This is my first post here so I am quite a newbie. I would really appreciate any help or advice :) I have already been diagnosed with celiac autoimmune disease just for background.\n\nMy symptoms have only been chronic fatigue, hair and eyebrow pain and hair loss, as well as a mild facial rash on my cheeks. My main symptoms is just that hair and scalp burning! I also have irregular periods and mid-cycle spotting. \n\nI DO NOT have any signs of joint inflammation or body pain and my CRP and ESR always come back in the low normal range. ANA negative, dsDNA came back negative as well. \n\nHowever, WBC &amp; C4 are always low and my ENA is positive with RNP at 1.6 (range &lt;1)\n\nDoes this sound consistent with MCTD? \n\nI am a bit insecure with the diagnosis because no one believed anything was wrong for a long time, then I got my celiac diagnosis and thought that was the smoking gun, only to have these few symptoms persist. I clearly have unresolved hormonal issues I am still sorting through as well. But the scalp and eyebrow pain sucks.\n\nI have went to 3 rheumatologists over the past 2 years and 2 said I was probably normal and the positive ENA can be found in normal people (essentially blew me off). \n\nThe third said it is likely MCTD and offered immunosuppressants.\n\nWith the unresolved symptoms and the lack of any physical inflammation or inflammatory blood markers, I am just a bit nervous about going on immunosuppressants and \u201ccalling it\u201d on a definitive diagnosis. \n\nDoes anyone relate or am I on the wrong track? There is nothing wrong with holding off on the medications until until you start to see issues with your lab work. I know a couple people who have done this. You have to do what you are comfortable with for yourself and your body. I take the medications because when I am off them m my CRP and sed rate are off the charts. Maybe talk to your general practitioner just to get another opinion . I hope you find the answers you are looking for. That does sound like it could be MCTD and you just have a mild case but it is not uncommon to take medications to control symptoms even when test results are borderline. Keep in mind, these tests are somewhat subjective so it is kind of up to you if you want to go the medication route. Before trying plaquenil or immunosuppressants, consider looking into the AIP diet or see a naturopath who may be able to help you regulate some of your hormonal issues. Glad to see someone else thinks this.  I had a RNP of 1.5 with only a lower leg rash as a symptom. The Rheumo wanted me to do daily prednisone and hydroxyq right away.  I was like \"pump the brakes.\"  I am going to get a 2nd opinion from a naturopath.", "Got diagnosed today Hello! So I did the ANA blood tests last week at my family care doctor, all they did was call and say I had MCTD so I asked what that meant and they said I have 1:80 speckled pattern and I felt kind of shocked so I did not ask any questions\u2026I scheduled a follow up for a month from now because he wants me to start taking cymbalta to see if that helps my pain. \n\nI do not want to get on cymbalta and after reading more about ANA test and MCTD I feel like I need a second opinion. My symptoms line up perfect with fibromyalgia but not so much with MCTD. I have muscle and joint pain at specific points usually, sleep problems, mainly insomnia and fatigue. I also have GERD and PCOS which I think are unrelated. \n\nFrom what I have read my titre level of 1:80 is low and might not indicate an autoimmune and some people with fibromyalgia also have positive ANA tests. I am just confused about how he could diagnose me so quickly with only one test? \n\nWhat questions and tests do I need to ask for? I am going to definitely ask for a referral to a specialist. \n\nAny advice is welcome, thank you! Start with a rheumatologist and a neurologist. Thank you, I fully plan on getting referrals to both. I refuse to just accept this diagnosis based on one test. Not to mention I am not taking medication unless I absolutely need it. In the last two weeks I started taking turmeric and I have noticed a big improvement in my pain levels so I am happy with that at least. PCOS has a lot to do with inflammation too. Im just skeptical in a big way. I have pretty much all your symptoms (including the PCOS) and was diagnosed with MCTD. GERD is extremely common in MCTD patients so if you actually do have MCTD, that is most likely the cause. What other tests did they run? Did they do an ENA panel or just an ANA panel, because without an ENA panel being run, they should not have diagnosed you will anything. The only test they did was the ANA test and the person who gave me my results just read it off a paper because she did not sound like she knew what it meant either. How old are you if you do not mind me asking? And when did you get diagnosed? I am 32, just wondering if this is normal for my age? They may suspect mctd and would like you to see a rheumatologist for further testing. An ana with any pattern alone can not be used to diagnose, but it gets the right tests to follow. There will be many tests and specialists along the way, try to ask questions as much as possible. Best wishes for some symptom relief soon. That is the thing though, he just wants me to take cymbalta and come back in a month to see if it helps my pain. I am not really down for that, I am going to make an appointment for next week and ask for a referral. I am sure you like your doctor and this is an outside observation. He does not seem competent I am 23 and I was diagnosed this year! MCTD is most commonly diagnosed in women in their 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s so even tho it is a rare disease, our age group is the most likely to have it. You definitely need more tests done tho because MCTD is not diagnosed without having a positive U1 RNP antibody. Is there a chance they tested for that antibody and did not say anything and that is why they gave you the diagnosis? Have you looked at the bloodwork that they had done? Well, that is what I am thinking, I lost a lot of confidence with him today. He is great when you have got a cold or for regular check ups but I am not going to leave this in his hands. Interesting, I mean from what I have read so things line up but I do not think they did any other tests. I did not see the work up though. \n\nAccording to this peer-reviewed journal article and many similar articles, you really need to have a test for anti-RNP antibody, and it is pretty much present in everyone with mixed connective tissue disease so if you do not have it, then MCTD is probably not the correct diagnosis.  Also, standard treatment pretty much involves hydroxychloroquine and/or prednisone.  Cymbalta would not treat the actual inflammation and thus not help in the long term prognosis.  Do not be too shy about taking hydroxychloroquine as it is really safe and cheap.  Just be sure to get an annual eye exam since it can cause retina damage that can be kept minimal if caught early. I have both fibro and MCTD (unless MCTD explains my previously diagnosed fibro symptoms? Idk yet) and there was a difference between my fibro pain and my MCTD pain! It is always different for everyone but I got a ton of general body aches in my muscles with fibro, and something like wearing a hair tie on my wrist would make my whole arm hurt. \n\nFibro pain is usually soothed with heat, for me. With MCTD it is specific joint pain that feels very hot and a cold compress relieves the feeling of inflammation and warm pain. Again, very different for everyone I am sure. \n\nCymbalta is also used to treat fibro! It helps my friend a lot but did not help me, and the process of going off of it was absolutely hellish, I never want to feel that way again. Interesting, yes I am very concerned about the effects of cymbalta, I do not want to mess with my brain chemistry at all. I had a very bad experience with klonopin because my previous doctor did not understand it and told me it was completely safe which is not true at all as I found out after two years of hellish withdrawal symptoms. Never again! Mctd is not just based off ANA. The speckled pattern is however, telling, and probably what your dr hs basing off. That being said, gerd CAN be related to mctd, and pcos CAN be related. \n\nPeople with mctd can have esophageal problems. It literally can affect your entire body! Most people do not really quite grasp that. It is systemic.\n\n\u201cPositive diagnosis of certainty requires the presence of Antibodies Anti-U1-RNP .\n\nBesides the classic manifestations, almost any organ can be impaired: the vascular system, skin, gastrointestinal tract, musculoskeletal system, cardiopulmonary system, hematologic system, kidneys, and the central nervous system .\n\nAmongst the gastrointestinal manifestations of the MCTD, the esophageal symptoms were the most common, being found in about 85% of the cases. These disorders appeared both in the upper third of the striated muscles and the lower \u2154, containing smooth muscle .\u201d\n\n\nNow as far as pcos is concerned, there is newer research that is pointing towards pcos being an autoimmune disorder. Basically once you have one autoimmune disease the chance of you having multiple goes up by like, a lot. I was diagnosed with pcos when I was 16, and again at 29, verified again at 38. All different doctors. Somehow, I managed to have two kids! The first one took 7 years and the second one took another 4 to conceive- the second one happened 6 months after I started hydroxychloroquine. So my body may have been attacking things without my knowledge.\n\nThe cymbalta is for nerve pain and muscle pain and is used for fibromyalgia- so if your doctor wants to try it, why resist? You yourself suspect fibromyalgia, and you know your body best. The side effects do not seem like they are that bad - in fact one would argue they are better than most autoimmune medications\u2026\n\nCymbalta -\nNausea, dry mouth, constipation, loss of appetite, tiredness, drowsiness, or increased sweating may occur. \n\nHydroxychloroquine-\n\nheadache, dizziness, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting, rash, cardiomyopathy, vision loss, tinnitus- and like A shit load of other awful things BUT they have to list every awful thing that happens to everyone AND at the end of the day the medication gave me my life back.\n\nMy recommendation is go see a rheumatologist.\n\n:) Where I am you have to see a rheumatologist to get a diagnosis for both MCTD and/or Fibro. I have been diagnosed with both myself. You do not have to start any medication you do not want to. \n\nI once had a neurologists tell me she had to prescribe a specific med first for insurance purposes but more or less told me I did not even have to try it. It was just a mandatory step before she could give me what would really help. PCOS can also be autoimmune.  Do not pass up a chance to fight the long term effects of MCTD.  Check RNP levels. That is most indicative of MCTD. Was that done? Or C4, C5? Or CRP levels? There are other tests. Sounds like a second opinion is a great idea. Check around for a good rheumatologist. Where do you live?", "Prednisone effectivity? Hi,\n\nI have not been formally diagnosed with MCTD, but it is what all my blood tests come back positive for and it is what me and my rheumatologist are trying to prevent from developing further.\n\nI have had a couple painful, swollen, sausage fingers (and a toe!) for several months now, as well as intermittent lower back pain and stiffness. I was on a relatively high dose of ibuprofen for a couple months, but while it helped with the pain, my digits remained inflamed. \n\nI have just been put on hydroxychloroquine and prednisone (which I am to ween off of over 20 days) to tide me over until the former starts working. However, I have been taking 20mg for 5 days now and I have not noticed much of an improvement. \n\nNormally I would not be too concerned, but my doctor made it sound like I should expect a huge improvement within a couple days, and that this should give us a goal to work toward with other treatments. However, I am still here with hot swollen fingers and moderate pain. Is this okay? Is it possible for the prednisone to still make a drastic change in my symptoms within the next 15 days? Could a different steroid be more helpful? Is this the best I am going to ever feel with medications??\n\nI am just new to all of this and feeling pretty overwhelmed and bummed out. I just want to be able to use my hands again. :/ Some just do not get the relief others do on prednisone. I know with me I did not feel ANY different. My body is kind of strange as far as meds go\u2026 but as far as the Hydroxy\u2026 I was just put on 3 weeks ago.. my dose is 400 mg and the doc expects 3-6 months to notice a difference. I am just waiting to see.. \nI will say it is very important that you like the rheumatologist and that you can discuss your concerns. If you do not find another\u2026 if you do, just give it some time and discuss things with the rheumatologist. I wish you the best of luck with everything!! You may need a higher dose, tell your doctor.\n\nI am on day 4 of this round for a flare and feel amazing. Everyone responds differently\u2026\n\nIt took me 7 months to feel better on hydroxychloroquine. Did they consider an infection for the fingers? Steroids would not help infection, and infected fingers are common. I have had to have an infected finger drained and I also took antibiotics before it would heal. Viruses and fungi can also cause these symptoms, in addition to bacteria. \n\nCould also be chilblains, especially if you have Raynaud's as well. I would expect steroids should help that, unless blood vessels remain abnormal. Then you might see about additional medication to treat that. They can prescribe blood pressure medicine that may help.", "ANCA Anyone have high ANCA levels with MCTD? Or is it only specific to vascular diseases? Thanks in advance!", "Tapering Prednisolone - one more try Hey all, I have been told by my rheum to start tapering my prednisolone dose again, very slowly. I have had two unsuccessful attempts in the past. Today is my third day on the reduced dose: The symptoms are creeping up on me again. :/ Does the body need to adjust to the new dose? I am wondering if I sold just hang in there for a few days and see what happens or abort the mission one more. Has anyone had similar experiences? I have had a very little experience.  What dose have you been on, and  how are you reducing? Started with 10 mg two years ago, only ever got down to 6. Reducing by 0.5 mg bi-weekly. Current goal is 5... That does sound pretty good.  When I weaned my hubby off his SSRI, I took out one half pill per week, so it took several months, and he had no side effects.  (1/14th).

I used it for pain and sleep but I did not see enough benefit to add it to my regimen regularly, given I already take numerous meds. Maybe it is because a lot of my pain is from neuropathy. \n\nI have never heard about using CBD for raynauds and I am not sure that it would address the core issues around blood flow. But  if you have seen any studies about it or heard from your doctor I would be interested in learning more. I use a CBD lotion for my hands. It does help, but it does not handle all the symptoms. Our club has three members using CBD oil for Neuropathy with some success, if that is any help.  Hope you find some relief.  philip I use it for athletic recovery and inflammation from that - I run and do obstacle course races. I think it helps recovery better. I take gels and use balm.", "Heliotrope rash on face I have suspected MDCT or lupus and have a rash that includes redness around my cheeks and nose (like a malar or butterfly rash) but also blue lines under my eyelids and broken blood vessels on my upper eyelids. These broken vessels create a very faint blue/purple like color on my skin. My neurologist referred to it as a \"heliotrope\" rash but my rheumatologist just called it the malar rash. Does anyone have anything similar going on with their eyes? I am just having trouble figuring out whether what I am dealing with is more MCTD or lupus. Other symptoms include neurological issues like muscle twitching, raynauds, dry mouth/eyes and skin thickening, especially on my feet (I think it is called \"hikers feet in Dermatomyositis). All things that seem to fit more with MCTD. My rheumatologist also said that \"people do not' really get diagnosed with MCTD any longer--it is an old term and now we just say early lupus\" which I do not think is correct. Because it seems distinct from lupus in a lot of ways. Well, fuck him and the horse he road in on.  I would find a new rheumy, and get some treatment done those conditions. Both rheumatologists and the dermatologist I have seen are confident MCTD is a valid diagnosis. \nA malar rash, to the best of my knowledge, only covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose; it seems really off to me that he is dismissively calling it a malar rash. \nIf you can, I think you really need a second opinion.

Yes it can definitely affect lab results..  have you tried using anything on the rash itself ? I have a malar rash on my face and when it starts getting too red I put hydrocortisone cream on it.

I become stiff all over and I am an in a decent amount of pain (I have a high level of pain tolerance). I start to lose my balance and will start list to the side until a family member catches me or a I can steady myself again. But it gets to a point where my body just stops. I cannot move any further and the pain is so intense. I am diagnosed with MCTD, Chiari Malformation, Intracranial Hypertension, hEDS, and a slew of other things. Any insight or help is greatly appreciated!! Have a beautiful day! It does not sound like anything that would be from MCTD specifically, I have never heard or experienced anything like this before. It may be one of your other issues that you have. Unfortunately though the things that make up MCTD (specifically lupus) is known as the great imitator, giving symptoms that are present in other illnesses. Are you on medication for it? I have had this happen a few times, with no good explanation. I was sent to a neurologist for some testing, but they found nothing. This mostly happened to me before my MCTD diagnosis in Feb 2017. So I think the Plaquenil I am on may help. \n\nI am sorry I do not have any answers to share, but you are not the only one this has happened to. Thank you! It helps to know that at least I am not the only one out there that this has/is happening to. But I am very sorry you have had to experience this. I am glad to know that medication is helping you! I am not on any medication for MCTD. I recently switched rheumatologists because I could feel my old one getting frustrated with me. I am a medical anomaly. My neurologist feels I need to be on medication for joint and inflammation but I have only met with my new rheumy 2x and once was virtual due to Covid. I am constantly on medrol packs to bring my inflammation down so I would think the logical thing would be to put me on a biologic or something! Thank you for your insight!! I am surprised that you were not prescribed with hydroxychloroquine when you were diagnosed with MCTD. That seems to be the go to treatment that people are started on - I was given it before my diagnosis was confirmed. \n\nHow long were you seeing your previous rheumatologist for? It seems crazy that you have a diagnosis but have not been offered anything given the importance of controlling levels of disease activity. \n\nWith all your comorbidities, I assume you are seeing multiple consultants from different fields. Have any of them been able to offer any insight or treatment suggestions? \n\nI have not experienced anything as severe as what you are describing but my muscles used to seize up as a result of deconditioning after I first became ill. It took physio and very, very gentle increases in exercise to overcome it. I am not at my pre-diagnosis level of fitness, but after a lot of work, I do not experience the same degree of pain and loss of function. \n\nIf you have not seen a physio who understands chronic pain, it might be worth asking for a referral. You may be able to get help with both physio and medication through a pain management team. It is definitely worth exploring. My gait goes sideways often. I run into walls and cannot stay in a steady straight line in grocery aisles, but it more of a weakness than a tightness or pain. Do you get any nerve sensations or tingles when this happens? Your neurologist may have some answers or suggestions that you Rheumatologist may not. I have heard of things like this happening to a lot of people with mctd and EDS. Something similar happens to me as well Lol I do that too and have chalked it up to both a combination of MCTD and EDS (classical). It is like I am fine and then I cross some invisible line and my body says nope. I think for me it is something to do with the compression in my cervical spine throwing everything off and maybe a mixture of cold weather. I have noticed the cold can cause my body to almost immediately fold up and inward. Both my rheumy and my neuro have asked I stay out of the cold", "Anti-anxiety/depression meds Has anyone had any luck with these?\n\nFor me:\nRitalin/Adderall/Wellbutrin caused an initial benefit, but I kept needing more to get the same effect. After some time, anxiety and gut pain got bad\n\nAmitriptyline caused no benefit and grogginess, irritability, and brain fog immediately and these problems persisted\n\nCitalopram helped sleep and depression but caused gut pain, diarrhea, and anorgasmia.\n\nWeed helped at first but then jacked up anxiety and gut pain.\n\nCurrently having decent success with mirtazapine at 15 mg/day but doubling to 30 mg/day to reduce grogginess.   Apparently low dose is very sedating but higher is not.", "Anyone have experience with a Gastric Emptying Scan? Hey guys, I just had an appointment w my GI doctor and they are scheduling me for a gastric emptying scan, has anyone had one and what should I expect? I have read a little bit on it already and it sounds miserable It is really not all that bad. I have done a couple. You do not eat the night before, then you go in and eat a bowl of scrambled eggs and a piece of toast, plus drink a cup of water. You have got about ten minutes to eat it all and then depending on the length of the study they ordered they have you do scans about 30 minutes after. You just have to keep it down or the test is a failure. If it is a really bad day and you are struggling with the nausea, try to keep yourself distracted. I would recommend brining your phone or a good book anyway. It is a lengthy test. How lengthy? About a few hours? Thanks for the comment though, it is reassuring that it is not as bad as it sounds. I am nervous since it is my first more invasive procedure since I first got sick 4 years ago, after this is an endoscopy. Have you had to get one of those as well? Yeah, mine was about four hours. I have had an endoscopy as well. They put you out for that, so no worries there. It is just like taking a nap. Worst part is maybe not eating or having a sore throat when you wake up if you even get that. It is all not as scary as it sounds!", "Absolutely freaking overwhelmed I was diagnosed about 2 months ago, after 20 years of being told I had fibromyalgia and gradually becoming more and more certain that something far more serious was happening. I am missing most of the skin in my mouth on my cheeks and gums, eating is so painful. I can barely use my hands even to type this. My arms and hands are in considerable pain all the time. I would gladly take narcotics for pain, but they do not want me to. They do not have to feel it, either.\n\nI have been in hydroxychloroquine for several months now, and I will be starting methotrexate followed by an infused biologic whose name I have forgotten. My rheumatologist assures me that these drugs will help my pain greatly, but after all these years of bullshit and lectures and lies by doctors who usually meant well but did not help, I have no faith at all. I feel I have to brace for the possibility that this is as good as its going to get, likely followed by far worse. And I am not young. I went into septic shock earlier this year, almost died. This amount of physical pain is eroding my will to go on. I am still here because of my son and because I was raised catholic and I am conflicted about choosing how my life ends as opposed to letting nature take its course. I want to have a good attitude about this and I am trying to focus on what I CAN do and not what I cannot. But inside of me, I am still reeling. I do not know how I am going to bear up. I am not accustomed to thinking of myself as a weak person: but this is kicking my ass. Any advice or words of encouragement would be welcome. And if I have said something I should not, I apologize and please delete this. Thank you guys so much. I appreciate just having a place to say this. Do not give up! It will get better! Plaquenil generally takes up to a year for full benefit, hopefully the others will make you feel better quickly. I too wanted to give up and die probably a year or so ago, but I am living a fairly normal life now. Thank you so much for the ray of hope. I just do not want to feel so small and whiny  I want to leapfrog over the shock and sorrow straight into some kind of zen level of acceptance and patience. I know life does not work that way. I just want to feel like a honorable person, and when I am feeling so sad and overwhelmed, and my thoughts stray into the darkness, I do not feel honorable at all. That is not how I want to be remembered. Anyway, thank you for your kind words. I will try to hope. Plaquenil is not a miracle drug but it is helpful to some. Pay attention to your side effects and your regular symptoms. Keep a journal if you like. A quick daily symptom journal, same time each day. Or a weekly \u201cthis is how I have been feeling this week\u201d. Gradually you should notice less and less symptoms but it takes time. Ask your doctor if taking prednisone in the interim would work for you specifically. It helps get you through the waiting. I am on month 7 of plaquenil and prednisone. I feel better than I did last year but I have a long way to go. I am currently trying to wean off my prednisone. From 10mg to 7.5 I was okay. I stumbled at the drop from 7.5mg to 5 and had to lengthen the time at 7.5 by a week. Then at 5 my first week was tough. By week two I was better. Tried to follow dr instructions to drop after week 2 down to 2.5; failed miserably. Had to go back to 5.0 for another week. Tried again to drop to 2.5, failure again. All my joints were in agony. So I am back at 5 again. I will try again next week. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fTake each day as it comes and realize that we cannot compare ourselves to healthy people. We have limitations. We need rest breaks, some days more than others. Things like stairs can be daunting to us because we know it is going to hurt. \nJust try to look ahead to a year from now and think how much better you will feel vs today. Dont give up! I felt like this at one point, it is a journey to get better but it is worth it and can happen! I am proof. Be your own advocate &amp; listen to your body! I am also chiming in to tell you that medications have helped me SO much. Before, and during the first 6 months of my diagnosis I felt very defeated. I assumed I was destined to live my life in so much pain and sometimes immobile. \nI did not know about flare ups or that things can get better. I have been on plaquenil for 2 years and been on Benlysta now for 1. My symptoms are so much less than they were and my quality of life is exponentially better. \nI know that different medications work for us differently, but I just want you to have hope that something WILL help you. You are on the right path to finding out what that is. Just hang in there. And We are all here for you!! I understand your frustration, as well as I am able. I struggled for 2 years to get my flares under control; struck like a mack truck by an incurable disease out off thin air. The two main symptoms were pleuritis and pericarditis - very serious and debilitating. I tried plaquenil first for about a year or so and it was not effective. Eventually, after a very large flare, we switched up the meds and flare protocols and  i started to achieve near - remission. Right now I am on injectable methotrexate once a week, as well as colchicine daily. It is possible to beat this disease into submission. On top of meds, I made a lot of other lifestyle changes as well that have helped immensely - regular cardio and resistance training, healthy diet, sleep, no alcohol, no gluten etc. These seem basic, but if you actually make seemingly small changes, they add up in the long run. That is my story, and it does not mean you should go and tell your doctor how to treat you, but I say this to give you hope. If you do not truly believe you can get better, it will never happen. You can get there.\n\nAnd to your point about the doctors: there are no clinical trials that have been done for MCTD, which means there is no official treatment. There is also debate within the medical community whether it is even it is own unique condition. On top of that, it is an overlap syndrome, so it affects everyone uniquely. The point I am making here is that it can be incredibly hard to treat. It took me a lot of trial and error with multiple rheumatologists. Again though, you can win this battle, as frustrating as it may be. I wish I could tell you that it get easier and better, but it is always an unknown with this disease. 87% of people do very well or well enough with treatment to avoid organ damage and/or failure and death. All the demographics are a toss up too, the only common denominator seems to be our gender (women) in most cases. I am 33 and in the unfortunate 13% of us that cannot seem to get ahead of this thing. No rhyme or reason, it is just...idk biology I guess. The best things you can do are to become an expert on your disease, not MCTD, YOUR MCTD, so you can advocate for yourself, (because I know you have experienced the incompetency of doctors), lean on the people that love you and ones that understand you (FB has a few good support groups), and accept that sometimes all you can be is okay and that is okay. Keep your chin up, you will find comfort and support in places you never knew \ud83d\udc96", "Anyone have Negative AMA and U1 RNP? Hey everyone! I hope everyone is doing well!\n\nI have honestly been going through a miserable time the past 12 months. Especially the past 6 months. Mainly due to facial and neck pain.\n\nI have other symptoms too and i was tested back in March 2020 by a Rheum and ANA and U1 RNP were both negative. However symptoms have gotten much worse since. Especially since July and have been basically constant pain since then. \n\nSo I am wondering\u2026 \n\n1.) did anyone here test negative at first then months or years later test positive? Or anyone diagnosed without RNP positive? Or have you heard of it?\n\nI saw a medical professional say there was a small percent with MCTP with out positive RNP. That Is what i interrupted from the video here  at time stamp 3:20\n\n2.) Also has anyone had positive U1 RNP without swollen hands / feet, with OUT high blood pressure, and without any rash? I do not have any of those. But have some other related things.\n\nIf anyone wanted to know my current and past symptoms, they are\u2026\n\r\n\u2022\tDull pain right submandibular region (under jaw line, under tongue, original symptom Nov 2020)\r\n\u2022\tTightness / Stiff feeling right side of throat. Especially when swallowing. (Original symptom, but has become constant now)\r\n\u2022\tTightness / Stiffness right side base of tongue (original symptom, but has become constant now)\r\n\u2022\tPain back of neck on right side of spine. Gently Pressing that area radiates pain and pins and needles to right eye socket and right cheek area. (Signature symptom of occipital neuralgia)\r\n\u2022\tAll pain areas listed above are tender to press on. Best way to describe it is kind of like pressing a bruise.\r\n\u2022\tPins and needles numbness spot mid back right side of spine (non-painful)\r\n\u2022\tOccasional Twitches in right foot arch &amp; Painful foot Cramp causing toe to contort in abnormal position (on going for 4+ years, but made better with vitamin D supplements)\r\n\u2022\tRight foot toe beside pinky toe seems to have hammer toe and has dull ache pain\r\n\u2022\tDiagnosed with Raynaud\u2019s late March 2020 (tip of 1 toe turned blue from constantly going barefoot in my cold house). Has mostly been fine as long as wearing socks and house slippers most the time. \r\n\u2022\tRight nostril /sinus always inflamed. (On going for 4+ years) recently has become correlated with neck pain. When neck pain is bad, right nostril extra inflamed.\r\n\u2022\tHad a history 11 years ago of a 2-3 week period of really bad costochondritis. It was so bad even just vibrations from walking sent pins and needles through my ribs. Never came back since then.\r\n\u2022\tSeveral year history of ears occasionally getting red and warm\r\n\u2022\tMother has Rhuemtoid Arthritis diagnosed in her late 40s but likely had it longer\r\n\u2022\tSister has Chrons diagnosed in her late 20s but likely had it longer\r\n\u2022\tNo history if skin rashes, no history of blood pressure issues, no swollen hands or feet, never any fever, so I am missing a lot of common MCTD symptoms it seems, but seems something autoimmune related maybe is going on?\r\n\nJust tying to get relief from my pain some how and just was wondering about MCTD. My biggest fear of all my symptoms is I lose ability to swallow since I have had constant right throat tightness when swallowing for months now.\n\nAlso randomly there was a week and a half in early October where my symptoms were like 90% gone when I was on vacation. It was right after seeing a cervical chiro but revisting since then did not relieve symptoms so maybe it was just coincidence. Totally random but otherwise the pain has been constant.\n\nThanks! My doctor believes that you can have autoimmune disease with a negative ANA, albeit very rare, but I think a lot of doctors dismiss this. Have you been checked for fibromyalgia by any chance? A lot of your symptoms seem related to your muscles and nervous system, and honestly I believe that fibro/CFS are also autoimmune too but they just have not figured out the connection because it does not fit within the whole ANA model. Fibro tends to be diagnosed frequently alongside  lupus in many people so I think there is a connection.\n\nI initially did have a negative ANA, but I was on prednisone for something else, so that is likely why. My doctor put me on plaquenil for three months as a \"test\" and based on how I responded (and this drug was like a miracle for me) I was diagnosed. However, I had the heliotrope rash which is quite distinctive, too. Thanks for the response! I did not mention cause the post was already too long, but The 1 Rhuem i did see suggested I might have fibromyalgia after i tested negative for everything. However it does not seem to match. Fibromyalgia comes and goes from people I talked to in fibro group. My pain is basically constant and only located in those areas listed. \n\nSo I have Never had pain on the other side of my face or any other place I did not list. But thanks for the suggestion. I am probably going to get retested for ANA and RNP and other markers this month or next month just to make sure. I had pretty constant pain but I really do not know when the MCTD really began since there is a lot of overlap. For the under tongue pain, my parotid gland gets really swollen sometimes. You might want to look up parotid massage plus use heat in case this helps! (Especially with dry mouth since many of us have symptoms of sjogrens as part of MCTD as well). Thanks!! \n\nActually i did have an ultrasound that did show both my submandibular salivary gland and 1 lymph node were swollen back in December. That was a month after my symptoms started. However they were only mildly swollen. No lump on my neck and 2 ENTs said they could not feel anything abnormal.\n\nMy neurologist said the neuralgia can cause inflammation, so that is why she thinks they were mildly swollen. But i think you are right that could be at least part of the reason i have a soreness in that area. But still does not explain the full root cause of my pain from back of my neck, right face, and right throat.\n\nThanks again for the reply! I have never had positive ANA, but I have positive anti-RNP every time they test.  I have or have had many classic symptoms: raynaud's, sausage fingers, GI trouble, muscle pain, ...\nThese days, I am incredibly active in outdoor sports, but I have to make time for rest and eat healthy.  I also cannot eat large meals without pain so I do small frequent snacks. Thanks for sharing your experience! Glad you are active and seem to be doing well overall. I Hope you continue to do well and go into remission more!", "Pet Poll: Do you have pets? Pets can be a lot of work and very draining especially for folks who have a hard enough time caring for themselves. But pets can also add a lot more happiness, security, and love to your life. Not to mention, I always find that my symptoms tend to be less when I have to focus on caring for someone/something else rather than dwelling on my own healthcare.\n\n( My cat was sitting beside me as I answered this! :) My cats are my best medicine \ud83d\ude3b I have two feline overlords. For whatever reason, the poll will not let me select more than one option. We have three dogs (a HUGE GSD, a mini schnauzer and a mini doxie) and a not quite 5 month old red kitten. \n\nThey entertain me to no end. Two very large Akitas! Go check my profile\u2019s post history. They are cuties. \ud83d\ude0f I am pretty allergic to cats They really are very cute. They look like they would give the best cuddles. Good luck, I hope you find the perfect pup soon!", "I am beginning to wonder if I am legit going crazy I do not even know how to ask this and I am going to cry while I am writing it too which is so annoying. I do not understand what is wrong with me. I used to be occasionally rational anyway and now I am always on the sge of tears, so fucking emotional. This is worse than the hormone tidal wave of menopause ffs. I FEEL LIKE I AM GOING CRAZY. The pandemic has not really changed my oedaobal life at all. I have pretty much been a shut in for a few years now, just sick af with no real diagnosis doing my best to keep going, like we all do at times. So I do not understand why in this past mknth I am suddenly so broken inside, so fucking fragile, so full of sorrow and fear. I do not know how to feel good things very easily anymore. Music helps. But it mostly soothes me. I seem incapable of positive responses. And I cannot bug my rheumatologist again. I have had a weekly televisit since my mouth came apart inside. Finally beginning to heal, soon I can move past soft food and eat again. So I cannot drive her nuts with this.\n\nSorry for my distracted meanderings, and I hope this does not sound like self pity. I know something is very different in me, and I do not know what it is, how to fix it, or how to even say what is wrong. So thank you for even reading this of you made it this far. You are not bugging your rheumatologist, she is paid to provide a service. Reach out to her, I am sure she is used to seeing her patients struggle. If she cannot help, she may be able to refer you to someone who can.\n\nThe inside of your mouth came apart? I am slightly scared to ask... That sounds horrendous and probably very traumatic. \n\nIt is OK to not be OK and to need help. You do not even need a real reason to be struggling, sometimes that is just how life is. It did not come apart literally but I had almost no skin left inside my cheeks or on my gums to the point that a soft diet had become impossible and I was not going to ve able to keep speaking for long from the pain when it moved. They pulled me off methotrexate and added prednisone and it is finally effing responding. That was straight hell and the thing is I know people here go through much worse but JESUS, man. My desire to keep going is, let us say, not robust. I can eat soft foods and speak easily now, and even smile a little on kne side which is so nice. Some of the damage is layers and layers deep. It is been pretty shite. Menopause wreaks havoc on your mental health and general well being (Hi, I am there, too!) - you are not going crazy, your hormones are driving the bus. Add to that the very real struggles of MCTD, social isolation and the smorgasbord of symptoms, it is no wonder anxiety and depression are wreaking havoc. Are you on HRT?\n\nYou do have a very real diagnosis of MCTD. Take a moment to let that sink in. It is a VERY real disease. And whatever else is going on (menopause, etc.), THAT is going on, underneath it all. \n\nPlease give your PMC/PCP a call and explain what is going on. You need more support right now, including teletherapy. I have been afraid of HRT due to a strong family history of hormone dependent breast cancer, but I am not real concerned about it anymore. I am past menopause now, but I do need a lot more help than I have known how to ask for. Thank you. I will ask today what I need to do to qualify for teletherapy.\n\nI lost my PCP. I overdosed in my pain meds 4 months ago and they cut me off completely, and my PCP of over 10 years had her staff call the next day telling me to never call again. It was followed by legal notifications. I have a rheumatologist and that is it. I am mostly in my own. I have not even found a new doctor. I do not know how to stand all the pain. It is just all messed up. But I will call. Thanks again. Ask your rheumatologist to refer you to a PCM and pain management clinic that can work with you. Particularly after an OD, you should be in therapy, hon. I am shocked your PCP abandoned you (which is illegal in many jurisdictions) without referring you to proper specialists. \n\nTake care of yourself, and let us know how it goes. I got a new doctor finally so I can keep getting my bp and thyroid meds etc. And I made a appt for therapy. I am a little less overwhelmed today. Thank you so much for your kindness and for taking the time to answer me. Your kindness meant more than I will ever have words to say: I am half blind with tears of gratitude as I type this. People like you are very precious in this world. I still do not know how long I will decide to stand this level of pain. When I od'ed, all my pain meds were obviously taken away and I am left with nothing. I just gave up for those months. When I ran out of bp meds I just met it climb. Passive suicide. But after you wrote to me, I got my refills and got a doctor and I do not want to but I will go to therapy. And if it is ever open again they will refer me for pain management but that is a long way away if at all. My attitude is better, but my problem remains the same. I am being essentially punished for being depressed and having a bad bad moment. The sentence is a life in hell, or street drugs, or suicide. I do not want street drugs. I have been clean for over a decade and I will choose all the pain over that. I am trying for a fourth option although I do not see it yet. I will keep trying anyway. Thank you again. And if my so knew about this, he would thank you with all his heart. He is grown and gone but he still wants his mommy to be okay. I hope you have a day filled with moments of beauty and grace. I am glad you were able to get refills and a few things working in a direction forward for you. \n\n*zen hugs* Yep you are crazy because you went unhinged over a teen mom message board. Whack job \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "MCTD with pregancy Hi Friends, \nI am 33 years and diagnosed with MCTD  1.5 year back and married since 6 years .. We are trying for a baby but no luck.. My cycles are regular and my husband's results are also good . We have done 3 IUI cycles but failed. Gyno confirmed no issues but we do not know how to proceed with MCTD. Any one can guide about any treatment or process you follow to succeed.your thoughts will be really helpful to me \nThanks Thirty five years ago, but had a phone consult with Dr. Sharp, the doctor whose name was originally attached to MCTD (Sharp\u2019s Syndrome).  He told us there were no contraindications to pregnancy, and we went ahead, after six months of androgen therapy for endometriosis.  I assume you have been worked up for that? I have had 2 miscarriages before I got pregnant with my daughter (almost 4 years old now). After the second one, my rheumatologist suggested I try baby aspirin just to thin my blood a little, I do not know if it is a coincidence but after starting it up we now have a little one. \nI do have endometriosis and a family history of blood clots, so that might be why my rheumie had me try the baby aspirin. \n\nHave you brought your concerns to your specialist yet? I have MCTD, 34 y/o and I am 9 months pregnant. I used  Ovulation Test Strips and I think they were really helpful to understand my body better. My period was never very normal, but I was shocked to learn that I was not ovulating normally. A few others things that I did that I think contributed to making my body feel relaxed and healthy, acupuncture, yoga, and massage. Keeping your stress level low is important. Congratulations on your pregnancy! Wishing you and your little one an easy and safe labour. I am not a parent and have no desire to be one, but one thing I have learned from friends who do want kids is that it can take time. \nTry not to feel like this is on you or the fact you have MCTD. Even couples with no health issues can take time to conceive. \nWishing you lots of luck and hoping you do not have to wait long to welcome a new addition to your family. I have MCTD and I was having trouble getting pregnant too. We tried for 4 years. Finally I was diagnosed with MCTD and put on hydroxychloroquine. 6 months later I realized my period was like a month late. Now I have a 6 month old boy. I told my rheumatologist and she said a lot of women go on it and wind up pregnant and now some infertility people are using it. Not sure how true it is. All we can figure is it suppressed my immune system enough to let me get and stay pregnant. Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a Thanks for your reply .. I have not tried androgen therapy yet.will check with my gyncogolgist..Thanks again Sure Thanks for your reply and congratulations.. Take care \ud83e\udd70 Yeah I am in continuous medications with gyncogolgist and taking aspirin for last 3 months along with steriods, HCQS and AZR..But Thanks for sharing your experience Yeah that is true , Hoping for the best and will wait .. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f Really that is nice , I am taking HCQS for 1.5 years and started IUI 4 months back .. I think we have to wait and see then .Thanks for sharing \u2764\ufe0f I am not diagnosed with MCTD yet, but my test results and symptoms point to it.\n\nI had no trouble conceiving (despite really long cycles which I tracked with a BB Thermomenter). But I had trouble supporting the pregnancy.\n\nI had two successful pregnancies and two miscarriages. With my two living children, I was on Metformin when I conceived them - due to a PCOS diagnosis and insulin resistance. \n\nMy first miscarriage was a blighted ovum - the baby never developed. But my second loss came after we heard a strong heartrate and I was told it was due to clots.\n\nWhen I read up on it recently, I found that Metformin can work to prevent clots. So I think that is one reason it helped. Sure Thanks for sharing the info ..Really appreciate  Oh that is so good to know!! I was diagnosed a week after I found out I was pregnant and could not get a straight answer from my obgyn about the saftey of hydroxychloroquine. I am so glad I read this. Thank you for sharing. It is safe but you will probably want to have some extra maternal fetal care for ultrasounds. They will want to check the anatomy very well to make sure there is no heartblock. Thank you. My rheumatologist told me babies of mothers with MCTD are more likely to have heart issues and that hydroxychloroquine would help protect the heart, but I got scared after the obgyn would only say, \"if benefits to mother continuing outweighs risk of drugs to baby she should continue\"... I told them I had even started yet the med yet so there was no benefits as of yet, but they would just repeat the same phrase over and over again. It was really frustrating. My first ultrasound last week was good, but I finally get to see the actual doctor in a few days, so now that I know all this I am going to really press her.  I am only 12 weeks so maybe there is still time to start the med and protect the heart more. Thank you so much for sharing this info. By 20 weeks is when they are going to want to check the heart, they could not see my babies heart well enough so I had to go back at 24 weeks for another one. As long as your body is not treating the baby as a foreign invader you will be okay - your body will actually suppress your immune system a bit while pregnant so if you notice a reduction in symptoms right now that is why.\nIt is sadly temporary and most women will have a flare after giving birth so definitely take your meds! :) I had one about one month after having my baby in january and had to do a month of prednisone to get it under control and that is with my hydrox. I have been on meds almost 2 years. Thank you so much for all this information!!  Hi All, finally my pregancy is postive.. now I am in 7 th week .. but I need all your comments please, I tried to hold my neighbour 2 year kid as she tried to fell down from stairs.. I pulled her with little force and fir a moment I got shocked.. will it affect the womb ? Please share your thoughts..I am lil afraid", "Anyone else hypoglycemic? I recently got blood work done, and even after eating a bowl of steel-cut oatmeal with peanut butter, honey,  coconut, and dark chocolate powder and a banana on the side, my glucose was only 61 mg/dL.   I was generally feeling crappy, and I generally feel better when I do not skimp on sugar -- try to get it mostly from fruits, veggies, and ice cream.  Should I be doing anything differently? Anyone else have this problem? The problem with hypoglycemia is the \u201cspike and drop\u201d syndrome.  I can tell from one day to the next if I have worked out in the past 24 hours, and needed more complex carbs.  Eating small amounts, in more frequent meals, can control that spike and drop.\n\nSo, you should make sure that if you eat fruit or other simple sugars, you do not follow it with a fast.  And do not eat a lot of simple sugars and expect to feel better.  Next time, try some protein (an egg or can of tuna) for an easier way to level out the blood sugar. Test often so you can be sure about your warning signs for the spike &amp; drop as u/littleoldlady71 put it.  Keep a log for the doctor.  Keep something with you to eat for emergencies that is more protein based, small packets of nut-butter work well or not sugary protein drinks, things that do not need refrigeration. \n\nFormerly hypoglycemic till my 50's, then took a turn towards Type II. Good advice!\n\nI eat lots of peanuts, nuts, cheese, and healthy meats like sardines as snacks throughout the day so I think I am fine on the protein. Upvote is for advice, not turn to Type II.  That part sucks.", "Tests for auto-immune/connective tissue disorder? I suspect I have an auto-immune/connective tissue disorder. In fact, I am about 95% positive I do and so would like to get it diagnosed so I know what I am dealing with. I was referred to see a rheumatologist over a year ago but this looks like it is not going to happen anytime soon as I was triaged as not being urgent and they told me (After a year of waiting) that they simply are not seeing people like me at this time.\n\nSo I was wondering if I could get my GP to order some tests as this might speed things up in figuring out what is wrong with me. Does anyone know of any specific tests that can help in diagnosing issues like this? Check for inflammation markers, and Sm/RNP (U1 RNP) is an ENA associated with MCTD. Anti-Sm/RNP antibodies are a hallmark of MCTD and are found in the majority of patients with the disease.\n\nThose two and a pulmonary embolism is what got me diagnosed Thanks, good advice. I really appreciate that. Hope you are doing better now? pulmonary embolism is no joke.\n\nThen the question is, should I take the tests when I am feeling physically inflamed or does it not matter so much? I ask because I usually eat carnivore and my inflammation/pain comes down significantly but is still there to a degree. But if I eat a cupcake or some pasta I feel like I have been hit by a truck. Thank you, I am actually finally starting to manage this. That embolism was the most painful thing I have ever experienced. \n\nThat is tough.. I am not really sure. I mean, the antibody are in your dna, right? So those should always be there, but the inflammation markers may be normal if you are not experiencing a lot of it. Although, as of two weeks ago my inflammation markers have leveled out, but my hands and skin are still inflamed. So... I am really not sure about that one. Sorry, wish I could give you more. Good luck with everything, and keep us posted on here. Happy to hear you are on the up! Yeah cannot imagine how bad an embolism must feel and do not want to find out! Have you done anything differently which saw your inflammation markers level out?\n\nYeah, I doubt there is a good answer about whether I should take the test super sore or not but I will figure it out. Yeah, thank you!! \nSo, I have gotten more strict on my diet(no spices things((I come from an Asian family and LOVE Spivey foods so this really sucked. Lololol I think I actually cried about it)), no citrus, low acidic foods((so no more coffee)), red meat only about twice a month, and lots of veggies. Just clean eating. Although, I have noticed that diet is different for everyone. So find out what works for you. It will be one hell of a journey. I have also started to do pilates 2-3 times a week, and restorative yoga often(I am a Pilates teacher and yoga teacher). \nBut I think most importantly, I have managed my stress levels. Stress will immediately send me in a flare. In fact my body will tell me I am stressed before I even know it. It is nuts. \nAlso, I finally found a good system for taking and staying on top of my meds. Hopefully I will be able to get off some of them soon. That is awesome, sounds like you are managing very well and have found what works for you. Even though I do not know what specifically is wrong with me, I will agree with the importance of reducing stress and the benefits of yoga. Both have helped me out even if the yoga I do is in my living room on my own. I also got into Wim Hof method which I found pretty helpful. Think getting the diet right matters too and am really curious why different people do well on such different diets. I know someone else who is doing well on a similar diet to yours right down to the red meat twice a month (is that from a book or something?) think for me I mostly need to keep sugar, grains and oxalates to a minimum. Cruel irony is I can still handle spicy food without too much trouble! Wish I could donate that ability to you as I hardly use it! ANA is non-specific for a lot of autoimmune disorders\n\nRNP is fairly specific just for MCTD\n\nRF is non-specific for rheumatic diseases When you are feeling inflamed, I think the most important ones to get are sed-rate and CRP, because they are checking for inflammation, rather than just the antibodies. The antibodies can be high even while you feel fine or sometimes not high while you have symptoms, but CRP and sed rate follow the inflammation more closely (or they have with me, in the past) Thanks for this and your other comment. Both very helpful info and much appreciated. (Speaking for Germany)\n\nWhat your GP can test routinely and might give a hint is:\n\n\\- Blood Sedimentation Rate (BSR) - non-specific inflammation marker.\n\n\\- C-reactive protein (CRP) - non-specific inflammation marker.\n\n(Does not exclude you having something if it is in normal range, though.)\n\nWhat they should definitely test to help you figure this out is at least:\n\n\\- Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) - positive at some point in almost all connective tissue diseases.\n\nFor any further antibody panels, they might rightfully say it is not their job but the rheumatologist's - but with positive ANA, you might be able to get referred sooner.\n\nSorry you have to wait! Try to accomodate in the meantime. And be assured that you are not alone :) ! There does not seem to be a direct correlation between antibody titers and symptom intensity.\n\nIIRC, only Lupus patients can have a correlation between dsDNA titers and flares.\n\nIt is more of a symptom that you can test and quantify than the explanation of the illness. What country are you in?  That might make a difference, The tricky thing with rheumatology and autoimmune diseases is that everyone can present differently and the absence of blood markers does not exclude you from having a disease. I have had rheumatoid factor appear and disappear depending on disease activity that did not correlate with the severity of my symptoms at the time. I have only had elevated ESR and CRP tests a few times, but I have had a ( test show moderate-severe disease activity when my ESR and CRP are normal. My MCTD symptoms tend to lean more towards RA, but I also have lupus and scleroderma features. If you can, get an ANA, ESR, CRP, anti-Sm, anti-nRNP and/or anti-s-RNP (anti-RNP) SSA/SSB, Vitamin D, and a typical CBC and chem panel. 20% of patients do not have any autoantibody specificity, so it is not unusual for all of that blood work to be normal. Best of luck - I hope you can get a GP and eventually a rheumatologist who are capable of thinking outside the box because rheumatology is almost never one-sized fits all.\n\nSource: am an RN who worked with a rheumatologist before I had any autoimmune diseases which is one of the great ironies of my life... Lol yeah I am getting there. I am sure it will change again at some point too. You do t necessarily need a teacher or go into a studio for yoga. It can be better but doing it in your own in your space is also soo good. But if you ever want tips do not hesitate to contact me. Stress kills, for sure. Managing that alone with help tremendously. Obviously easier said than done lol. The diet I have chosen at Started out as the AIP diet, then through a process of trial and error I started to add things back into it. I forgot to mention that I cut down on sugar a lot too! Sugar is a drug, man, and I am addicted lol. Cutting out sugar was/is hard but helps tremendously.  But ya, just find what works for you. \n\nMay I ask what symptoms exactly you are experiencing? I am in Australia. Thanks, very detailed! This gives me a lot to go on. You are not wrong about sugar! I am about two years clean if you do not count the rare peer-pressured relapse that I almost instantly regret! Ah yeah, AIP diet makes sense and I guess what I was doing initially was similar (except with diary but a lot less plants). Was already put on a no-dairy diet as a kid for a while to see if it helped my eczema and if anything I got worse! I think I am on the extreme end of lactose tolerant, I may even be part bovine myself by now.\n\nAs for symptoms, well please excuse the long list or anything that seems irrelevant. I am also sure I am missing something.\n\nGrew up with allergies/eczema. Nothing life threatening though thankfully. Was also more often just sick as a kid, stomach issues, colds and flus hit me more often and harder than other people but apart from that I was very energetic and athletic as a kid and teen.\n\nI have a very abnormal vascular system, was born with a heart murmur and it was much later discovered (like after all my issues got bad) that several of my veins appear not to be working at all so my blood is having to travel around on some backstreets since some of my highways are closed and I have issues with varicose veins and blood pressure can vary wildly. A few other people in my family have similar but far less severe issues.\n\nGastroparesis/reflux/hiatal hernia - Used to be so bad I did not eat solids for 2-3 months and had a period where I threw up undigested food every day for about 6 months. Symptoms of which have been damn near cured by changing my diet which is nice so finally off the meds after 15 years. It was actually my gastroenterologist who referred me to see a rheumatologist.\n\nChronic pain and fatigue - Been worsening over time, became a huge issue a few years back during a period of extreme stress and when I had to go in for surgery. Some of the pain resulting from surgery just did not go away. Some other pain like in my back, neck, hands and feet comes on without injury. It got to the point where sitting at a desk for a workday, even with breaks and stretches was just impossible as my back and neck would just go and I was seeing physios every day to try to ease it. It does improve with changing diet though but I still struggle to stay in one position very long and when my neck is out I get the worst headaches.\n\nTendinitis-like issues and trigger finger - this is becoming more of a problem over the last 2 years.\n\nHair loss on lower legs.\n\nI am not sure what it is called, but a hard, dark build up of scar tissue on the skin of my ankle unrelated to any injury. Came on by itself many years ago and never went away. Looks like I got another one trying to form on my knee.\n\nSwollen hands and feet, especially in the morning.\n\nSleep apnoea - Not so bad and again, improved with diet.\n\nIncreased sensitivity in the skin and nerves feeling very worked up. For example there are certain fabrics that I cannot touch without feeling very uncomfortable and I have had periods of sensitivity when my feet would feel very uncomfortable if I walked on my carpet. Had something similar for a time between my fingers which was kind of like restless leg syndrome (get that too) where I could not keep my hands still. Hard to fully describe all this. It seems to come in bouts that last weeks or months then go away. Read that potassium citrate helps with restless leg so been using that whenever any of my bodyparts get super restless or nervy and seems to help after a week or two ... or maybe that is just going away on its own? Who knows.\n\nMigraines/sometime full sometimes just ocular. Weirdly with me the headache is not always as severe as in other people but the nausea, dizziness and visual disturbances have been pretty extreme. When the head is bad, usually the other symptoms are less severe. Ocular migraines on their own only seem to happen in summer, I tend to be pretty heat sensitive in general even for a white guy in Australia.\n\nI am not hyper mobile or anything or have super elastic skin like the classics ED type, but I am above average in flexibility and have different skin to anyone else I know. Kind of a rubberface, been compared to Jim Carrey a lot when I was younger. Haha is that a symptom???\n\nI have also recently realised that I think I experience some sensations quite differently to the majority of other people so think this might be a factor in maybe not being fully understood by doctors in the past.\n\nAnyway, sorry for how rambling this is and I appreciate your interest. I am having a bad day today in terms of pain and my thinking is a bit off I am afraid. I just had to have the BBQ sauce on my pork last night did not I!? That is awesome, thanks for that. Do doctor's in Germany often say things are not there job? I have finally managed to establish the type of relationship with my GP where I call the shots thankfully. The only reason I am still with her is her cooperation makes up for her lack of intelligence. No need to be sorry!!! I would not have asked if I did not want to know. \n\nSounds very similar to my story. \nWhen I was younger I had really bad eczema, and tummy problems. They ran a bunch of tests on me but did not find anything. Thought it was just a stomach flu or something \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44Then a year before my diagnosis I had swollen and painful hands. My acid reflux was off the charts and still is sometimes. Then I had that embolism and was diagnosed. Hah... took a blood clot to get diagnosed, AND they wanted to blame it on my birth control first. But one dr wanted to check my anti body\u2019s and after finding that they decided on MCTD. Some drs suck and some are great. I hope you find the great ones. If you live in Southern California, United States, then I can refer you to the drs I see. \n\nThis really does sound like an autoimmune problem. I mean, I am no dr but it really sounds like it. \n\nUnfortunately with autoimmune cases you reaallly have to be your own advocate and push the drs. Make it known that you do not feel okay and it is not normal. Otherwise, they will just keep brushing you off. \n\nIn the meantime keep doing what your doing with diet, and try to find things that ease the pain - that are not pain killers. Pain pills are a slippery slope. I take them but only when I cannot bare the pain. At one point I almost got addicted and many people do. \n\nPersonally, I love epsom salt baths and CBD. Although, CBD is not super available in all places. If you are in a place where you cannot get it easily then I am happy to mail you some. \nAnd like we said, stress!!! Keep the stress low as best as possible!! And movement!! Even if it is just smol movements. 5 minutes a day, or a short walk, or some simple stretching. \n\nThanks for sharing by the way. :) I have no experience with healthcare in Australia.  I am hoping someone else will respond.  However, if you can get your GP to run the tests, that would be a good way to start. It depends, but GPs generally refer people for out of the line stuff. Each doctor specialization gets a certain amount of money per patient and quarter year from the public insurance. Once that is used up, it becomes a losing business for the doctor to further treat that patient. Virtually any other specialist has more budget than the GP.\n\nThat is messed up in a way - bc of the financial restraints, many GPs in the big city here do not take new patients in public insurance. And my GP, for instance, tends to just dish out referrals to deal with his patients (others also wrote that in reviews). However, he would not refer me to a rheum bc \"my joints are not red swollen, they would mock the GP for referring\". But I got referred to orthopedist (anthralgia) and a blood vessel specialist  (Raynaud's). When I had finally begged and succeeded to ask him for ANA (he did not want to bc \"then I might want to have many more expensive tests\"), he phoned me extra to refer me to a rheum with urgency. No apology but I do not get doubted any more, which feels weird ^^'.\n\nI am sorry you have this strange relationship with your GP... Sounds like you have had a challenging and frustrating time getting the treatment you need but glad you finally got some action taken.\n\nYeah, my relationship with my GP is not ideal but I prefer to at least be listened to. Thanks for listening and all the good advice. It is nice to know I am not alone in all this and that I am not crazy for suspecting auto-immune. People do not always like those who try to diagnose themselves but sadly in my case nobody else is really doing it.\n\nLooking into auto-immune issues I am seeing a lot of similar stories to yours where getting diagnosed is a pretty big hurdle. Unfortunately I have gotten kind of used to having to advocate for myself more than I used to be comfortable with but it really is the only way I think.\n\nYeah, I try to avoid painkillers as much as possible. Most of the time I can get by without but do like epsom salt baths, icebaths, shakti mat has been somewhat useful in sort of scrambling the pain signals sometimes. I am a bit sad at the moment as some new pains have popped up that are interfering with my usual exercise routine which was sort of keeping me sane and keeping things under control but just have to keep adapting. It might sound a bit weird, but I am trying to avoid taking things as much as possible in order to sort of observe myself and to reprogram how I experience pain and things. Going to try to get some tests this week I think. Hopefully I will find out something useful.", "Dr recommendation in Los Angeles? This might be a long shot, but can anyone recommend a good specialist in the Los Angeles, CA area? Either LA or Ventura county preferably. \n\nThank you so much!!!", "I wish this was more active. I would love to be able to speak with others, even on a weekly or monthly basis, about anything. Symptoms, medical news, tips, general life.\n\n\nAnyone else? I see how active the Lupus and Rheumatoid subreddits are and am a little envious of the communities! I am in a few groups on facebook that are very active! Maybe try those? The lack of anonymity stinks but most of them are private groups (so your friends cannot see your posts unless they are also in the group) I am in a general autoimmune group on Facebook, but I had trouble finding one specifically for MCTD. Maybe I will look again.\nThanks! I would love to do this. Sorry, I am not good at being active on public places. We all have a lot going on, it is difficult! ", "(Part 2) Discussion: What impact has the Covid-19 pandemic had on your physical health, mental health, and overall life? Covid is one of the strangest things that has happened in my life-time and I do not think I am the only one. MCTD is difficult enough without having an unprecedented pandemic affecting our global, economic, and personal security. It is likely that this looming threat will not be leaving us anytime soon so addressing how it has affected us and how it may affect our future can give us the tools we need to cope. I would like to invite you all to share your story (or a short sentence) on how the Covid pandemic has impacted you. Maybe your mental health has declined or your physical health has been impacted (positively or negatively). Perhaps you have taken this time to reconsider certain parts of your life or you have found new ways to deal with the stress and anxiety. Or maybe, it is all the same to you. No matter what your story is, I would love to hear it. And again... I do not think I am the only one.\n\n*\\*Please remember, Covid-19 discussions can be highly political and emotionally charged, let us keep the conversation supportive and health-focused for our fellow Mixies - thank you!* Frankly, the constant anxiety of not knowing if our income sources are going to be shut down again (partner has been laid off twice for shut down orders since March) is affecting my mental well being. I am flaring more and harder. I am having a really hard time being motivated to do things for my health (like exercising, cutting alcohol). The only reason I feel sane is because we have been doing home improvement projects to get the house ready to sell of our jobs fall apart completely. Back in March, when all the healthy folks were first complaining about having to quarantine, I felt sort of vindicated, because finally someone was acknowledging that it sucks to be stuck in your house due to things outside of your control.\n\nBut now that we are in September, I am watching my neighbors have massive parties in their backyards, and hearing about how my one local friend is going to have to send her child to school every day because that school is not offering distance learning, it seems like everyone is just going back to their normal lives without having LEARNED anything (like... empathy toward the elderly and disabled...). Even though the threat is far from over, seeing people in my area stop wearing masks to the grocery store (for those rare times I am able to make the trip)... idk it is gone beyond \"disappointing\" into \"downright depressing\" territory. And I have already got depression so that sure is not helping, lol.\n\nMy treatment for MCTD has mostly come to a standstill, too, because my doc does not want to risk having me come to his office during the pandemic, but needs to see me in-person in order to move things forward. Everything sucks, basically :P\n\nSorry for the long complaint but whew I needed to get that out. In our state every school district is mandated to offer a distance learning option for parents even if the school is doing in-person learning. I wish I knew how to cut back my drinking. It is the main contributing factor to my weight gain. That, and being stuck inside the house since March. I thought ours had something like that too, but apparently the schools in my town in particular think \"distance learning\" = sending the kids home two hours earlier than usual, to finish the day out online. No rotating rosters or anything, all the kids are still in the same room together every day, just for two hours less. It is the weirdest thing.", "Acid reflux-what has helped you? Hey everyone! 23F here with mctd. For the most part my symptoms are pretty mild, but the one symptom that bothers me the most is chronic acid reflux. For anyone who suffers with this, what has helped you the most? I am overweight and do not have the best diet, has losing weight and/or changing your diet helped at all? I have not noticed any particular foods that trigger it. Thanks! You should talk to your doctor. Also try to have nothing to eat for about two hours before bed time. I am going to next time I see him but it is not until December. I will definitely try out the not eating before bed, though! Tums do tend to help but I have had slightly high calcium levels in the past and I know that they can make your calcium even higher so I try to avoid taking them too much. I know a medication but you need a prescription. It is called:\"  Domperidone\". I have been on omeprazole since the 80\u2019s, and I also have two Tums before bed (on an empty stomach). The not eating at least 3 hours before bed is important. My doctor prescribed prescription strength Pepcid, but you can get the over the counter stuff at the store, it is just not as strong, and gaviscon before bed. (I had an allergic reaction to it because I cannot do sea stuff, so I am on a calcium based antacid but gaviscon might be a better option for you.) I had to work very strange hours because of being in a different time zone than my work this past year, and not eating for 3-5 hours before I go to bed has literally wiped out my acid reflux. If I get hungry, I opt for super light things like some yogurt or herbal tea. Before that I was suffering from it very regularly, but this was very effective for me. Omeprazole really helps me. Figuring out food intolerances helped me. Turns out eating eggs (random) gave me terrible heartburn. Now I avoid them and I am fine. I will say it took me 10 years to identify that certain foods were causing it and I just thought I had heartburn. Try a food diary. Diet will definitely help because certain foods promote more inflammation. There are a couple really good meds for acid reflux you can speak with the doctor about.. Dexilant is one of them.. that is a maintenance med so it happens much less. Sucralfate and pantoprazole will help also. Sucralfate coats stomach so you have less symptoms so you take that one before meals. Pantoprazole you take once a day. Ask about those.. they are really great ones", "MY PEOPLE OMG I was not expecting to find a sub for other mixies! \n\nI am coming up on my 5th year since being dx'd. Steady disease progression in the last year and a half. Hi!! Yay someone is on!! Hey girl! How are you I am ok! Thanks. I am going on my second year of diagnosis now... really wish this sub was more active! \nHow are YOU? I know I saw it is dead but I am just glad I found it! I am doing ok, exhausted as always lol Do they have you overloaded on meds too? Not too bad! I am on Plaquenil, and Benlysta. \nThey seem to do the trick. I was diagnosed after one long bad flare up... so I honestly do not have any way to tell if I simply have not had another flare, or if the meds are working. You know? \nNot complaining, either way I am pretty stable. \nTruly dreading the forthcoming winter though. Reynauds is nasty! That is great! Plaquinel is always good to be on, no idea what Benlysta is but it sounds familiar. It is hard to tell what hurts because of what and does not hurt because of what lol Winter is not fun. I used to live in New England many moons ago but live in the south so ours are not bad but it gets cold and damp for months \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b Hey there, welcome! This place is pretty dead but I am usually around. Been with mctd for 4 years I want to say. Hi! I was diagnosed in 2017. Ah yah, I am in Massachusetts, so, winters suck! \nBenlysta is a weekly injectable, it is an immunosuppressant. Higher risk of getting sick sucks, but honestly I prefer that hermit life anyway. Lol. Shut up. I am from Connecticut! \n\nOhhh ok. I have been on immunosuppressants for 2 1/2 yrs. First Immuran, then Methotrexate, and now Cellcept which I have been on for a year and a half. I hate being on chemo, especially for this long, it is fucked up so many things. Ugh Hi!!! How are you feeling? Hi!! How are you feeling? So, my first Rheum said - we do plaquenil first, and prednisone (ew), but I was able to wean off the prednisone. He said next step was Methotrexate, but I was not prescribed it.\nThen, I had to switch doctors. New doctor said - Benlysta has had great results and was more \"well tolerated\" than Methotrexate. So, we skipped Methotrexate and went straight to Benlysta. Its been really good so far. \nIt can be taken as a monthly infusion (at a center), or a weekly self-injectable. I tried for the infusion, but its too hard to get a vein on me, so we gave up and went to the injectables. \nI am NOT in the habit of ever recommending or promoting medications to peeps, but you should maybe ask your doctor about it. The first 3 Rheums I saw never mentioned it. Seemed like they had not even heard of it. It is pretty new (2011, I think it started). So, maybe the long term tests are not available yet. I dunno. Anyway, something to consider! I cannot take it because I only have MCTD as opposed to say having Lupus and MCTD. The next step for me is Cytoxan which is my biggest fear Ah. I only have MCTD, as well. \nI mean, I also have EDS, but that is not autoimmune. \nBut I do not get how any of this stuff works :-/ \n\nI am going to go google Cytoxan now, and I am scared! Noooo do not do that LOL. I have friends with MCTD that have never been on an immunosuppressant and they have had 30+ years post diagnosis. Do not be scared and do not think about worst case scenario. I am in the advanced stages for unknown reasons but most people are not and will not be. I am sorry if I freaked you out, I know how scary it is, especially in the beginning. Pretty good most things considered! How are you? Adjusting to med changes, again \ud83d\ude2b LOL I was diagnosed in March 2018. I had numbness in the right side of my face and Raynauds and was seeing a neurologist who referred me to a rheum. My rheum thought I had systemic sclerosis based on my symptoms, but I wound up testing positive for MCTD. (Thank goodness.) I am on plaquenil and I lead a pretty normal lifestyle, I even still participate in triathlons because my symptoms are at bay when I exercise for the most part. Also, most of the numbness in my face has gone away. The Raynauds is still terrible, though. I have been told to just stay warm and take good care of my hands. Oh wow! That is fantastic! \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42 WHOA. I just stumbled on this sub (and this thread, lol) and I realize it is two months later and you might not see this, but I am from CT too!

I have recently come across people in my town and surrounding cities that have UCTD or MCTD. I found this surprising since MCTD is considered a rare disease...I have read some people have had this for decades before being diagnosed. Do you think this disease is more common than noted? I think this is probably true of a lot of rare diseases. I think the availability of information both for patients and doctors increases the likelihood of getting a diagnosis that previously may have gone undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed.\nI would imagine that like patients, doctors must utilise tools like the internet to discuss difficult cases and find out about conditions that are not well known. I think the more that happens, we will see a rise in the diagnosis of connective tissue diseases.", "Would these tests be used to diagnose MCTD?

Anti-RNP is a specific test that I do not see here. The tests here are broadly to look for autoimmune disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc). Often times if the ANA, IFA Panel is positive there is an auto/reflex panel that is run for the group of autoantibodies associated with the various rheumatic diseases ", "Newly diagnosed &amp; need some guidance Hi everyone I was recently diagnosed with mctd and lupus and I was just wondering a couple things because my doctor has not explained anything and is on vacation- first I am currently in a horrible flare it seems like my fever has not been under 99.5 for 6 weeks and has gone up to 101 3 times this week and tmi but I have missed 2 periods because of this flare and I am in pain a lot and it is never been this bad before. I started plaquenil a few days ago and I know it takes a long time to work but should I be scared? I have prednisone should I be taking that? My bloodwork from a week ago has not come back yet and my doctors are only going off of what the last bloodwork told them which is basically that something is wrong but I am not dying and apparently it indicated I do not have the disease active in my organs but I really feel so sick and it is been so long I am starting to get very scared so basically is this normal? My brain is really affected and it is made it really hard for me to write this up so I am really sorry if it does not make sense or is disorganized or something Hello, and I wish I could help more.  I have had MCTD for 30+ years, and was on plaquenil for a few years, but stopped years ago.  I have had flares, and that was not when the organ damage happened.  If mostly you are worried about the flare and you have been doing research that scares you, please know that this condition will change a lot during your long life.  It is not life ending, except in extreme cases, and the only place you should get your info are rarediseases.org, or Mayo Clinic, or any other reputable research hospital.  \n\nNext point, what were the steroids for?  Have you used them before, and for how long, and did they help? Thanks for the good sources! I know it is really easy to see scary things, I am mostly concerned about my test results reflecting my condition (condition like shape/working order not what disease I have) accurately, and because this flare has been going on so long and is so intense.. I am expected to work like this and I can barely eat and shower.. the prednisone was for the flares to see if it would help before I start plaquenil and it did but I think it got worse when I stopped because I have never felt so bad before for so long and I have been doing a lot of suffering for the past few years so yea it is just scary idk I forgot what my original reason for posting here was and I know I am making no sense I am sorry Welcome to the MCTD club. DO take the prednisone. It will calm your pissed off body down. You might even feel like a rockstar again. MCTD presents differently in all of us. Unfortunately there is no standard of care or protocol for treating MCTD. Generally, your rheumatologist will start you on Plaquenil first and that works beautifully for many people. It gave me vertigo so I had to stop. The second drug to try is often Methotrexate orally. It makes some people nauseous but I had few side effects. Then I started having breathing issues so they switched me to Cellcept. I am feeling pretty good! MCTD (like lupus) is dangerous when it attacks organs. Lung involvement tends to be the most serious concern so DO get a baseline pulmonary function test AND a CT scan with contrast for a baseline. The heart can be involved so an echocardiogram is important for a baseline. Finally kidney involvement is the third ranked complication of concern. Pain management is a big deal. I have a pain management doctor to help with that. But we can live long lives. Be gentle with yourself. You may find that if you overdo it when you are hurting and exhausted, your body will make you pay. So rest, take naps, light exercise if you can. Some people find incredible relief on the Autoimmune Protocol Diet. I have not been brave enough to try that out. Good luck! I imagine the main reason you posted is because you are worried, and you wanted some support.  Sometimes knowing that you are not alone in these worries, can help.  Are you on any Facebook support groups?  There are a couple that are very helpful.\n\nAlso, steroids are known for having some bad ups and downs.\n\nThere is a very important blog topic about \u201cspoons\u201d that you could get a copy of and read, about saving your energy for what matters. \u201cThe Spoon Theory by Christine Miserandino\u201d. Hello, first stop being scared and do not google too much about mctd or lupus. Rely on your doctors and people who are going through the same for guidance.\n\nYour first step would be to get the correct diagnosis. MCTD and lupus are two different breeds. Anti-U1RNP antibody is one of the specific marker for mctd. \nNext get the baseline tests for your lungs, heart and kidney functions. This is very important. My incompetent rheumatologist brushed off my breathlessness and fatigue as symptoms of hypothyroidism(which I had) inspite of having mctd diagnosis too. I lost some lung capacity points before the lung scan detected fibrosis a year later(i had difficulty climbing stairs at this point).\n\nThey will probably keep you on plaquenil, it worked on my arthritis. In case of lung/other organ involvement they might include cellcept which has helped greatly. \n\nThere is nothing to be alarmed about. Currently there are a lot of treatment options that can manage the disease well, you just need to make sure you have good rheumatologist helping you. Take care. Thank you so much for all of this information it is so helpful. I will take the prednisone. My doctor said the lupus is not attacking my organs but I am pretty sure mctd is affecting my lungs and maybe my heart I just hope she believes me when I tell her that.. it is really depressing because I feel like she should ask me about my lungs but somehow I am nervous to ask her about them idk I just wish my doctors cared about me.   I am really trying to be easy on myself but the people around me are demanding and do not understand my diagnosis so it is very hard. They do not understand when I say I need to be careful they do not help me out much and they do not understand that it is serious and real and I am too tired to explain it to them so it is a mess. But I am trying very hard and learning to take myself seriously even when nobody else does.. thanks for all this information and all the encouraging kind words it means a lot to me just to have someone understand Yes that is true I am scared and no one around me understands what I am going through or even tries to. I do not have any support groups but i should try and look for some. I am shy and it took a lot for me to start posting here even though.. thanks for that recommendation I will definitely try and find it and read it that sounds like a lesson I need to learn. Thanks so much Where are you located?  I am guessing UK?  If you need more recommends, let me know.  How about those steroids?  How much were you given, and how were you told to take them? I am in New England USA. tbh im scared of the steroids!! because when I stopped it this happened... she gave me 5mg tabs and said take 3 a day for 3 days then go down, it was an experiment. I only have a few left so I could take 2 for a few days but I do not want to do something wrong and feel worse afterwards because I will lose my job if this does not calm down Yes, an abrupt decrease in steroids can lead to lots of problems.  What you could do instead is try a schedule of 5mg one day, 4mg the next, 3 the next then 2mg, then 1.  By then, you could get a call back (if you left a message for your doc).  I know the tabs are 5mg, but you could cut them.  What the first round told you was only that this is steroid sensitive, not that it would be a good course.  If you are in a lot of pain from the flare, a low dose would tell you whether or not it helps. I have learned to tell them what I believe needs to be done. You are the patient with the disease. So you are effectively in the driver\u2019s seat. Let me find a pub med article for you to reference. Baseline studies are a must and they cannot say it is not affecting your lungs if the PFT and lung CT scan has not been done. To say you are all clear on organ damage is an unfounded opinion which the are making based on no medical evidence. Questions to ask your rheumatologist \n1) how many MCTD patients do you treat?\n2) what are your primary goals for my treatment \n3) what are the primary concerns in MCTD patients \n4) what is your methodology in treating MCTD\n5) what organs have you seen involved \n6) do you think think a baseline is required? If they say no, tell them you want a referral to a pulmonologist and cardiologist as well as a urologist to assemble your team. \nThis way you are not questioning their expertise as an MD. Here is the article which might help you. \n\n I want to do that but I am scared I will mess up weaning off it again and I will get sick again \ud83d\ude25 I should ask for 1mg tablets maybe that will be ok.. I am scared of asking anything like I know anything because my primary doctor just opposes whatever I say just so she can say I am wrong. My rheumatologist seems better but I am worried she will say everything is fine and I do not need any organs checked because she said my c3 and c4 is not low so the disease \u2018is not active in those areas of the immune system\u2019 whatever that means... thanks for these questions and the article I will definitely need it I will probably just say \u2018what do you think of this?\u2019 so it does not seem like I am trying to be smart \ud83d\ude23 Where do you live? I can assist if you are in the US. U you ou can file a complaint with the state licensure. If it is a one party consent state record her. Tell her I want these tests please put a referral in. If she refuses, then it is clear she does not know what she is talking about. My rheumatologist was kind of mad when I told him I got a pulmonary referral. He wanted to know why. \ud83d\ude02 because I cannot breathe. If you are in the US I can help a bit. I do understand.  I hope that you can manage this without steroids, as soon as you get it under control.", "Advise I have had autoimmune symptoms since I was thirteen, you know, the standard high ANA (tittering from 150 all the way to over 600), nausea, constant low-grade fevers, swelling, digestion issues and muscle twitches.\n\n I have learned to deal with them for years now, but I started recently having issues with them again, and I have no idea how to deal with them. There is small calcium deposits forming on my fingers, all the other symptoms, swelling to the point I cannot walk, a lot of pain, muscle weakness (to the extent that I was tested for ALS by my neurologist), issues talking, autonomic problems and my fingers are becoming more and more curved. \n\nIn the past, when my blood was tested, (YEARS ago) I tested positive for some scleroderma anti-bodies (anti-centermore B), my ANA had a speckled pattern, my A/G levels were off and so was my hemogoblin and the specialist I saw at that time said that my tests were too inconclusive and that I was too young anyhow to be diagnosed with anything. \n\nRecently, we went to see another doctor for a second opinion, and he said I should be re-tested for sclerodema and also I should be tested for mctd. He also said because of the nature of my issues I should go to Mayo clinic. The problem is that it is not an affordable option at the moment, so I am just curious if anyone here knows of tests I can ask my family doctor to preform? Also, any tips for managing autoimmune issues of this nature? At this point, I have no idea of what kind of life style I should be living apart from drinking a lot of water and cutting out certain foods. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I have some advice for you.  First, reddit is dead for this subject.  Go to facebook and join some of the MCTD or AI support groups.  They are very busy with lots of informed people there.  You will get nothing of value here.  I waited a while too, but I should not have.  Join there and you will learn more than from your doctors most likely.  I know I did.  In terms of actual helpful advice, first are you in control of your diet?  You should be trying an AIP diet to see if you have a reduction in symptoms when you go at least a month without a ton of stuff you probably eat every day now.  Next, you need to have you r ENA tests - it is the one that test Anti RNP for MCTD as well as stuff for rheumatoid arthritis and a few others.  You should also be aware that there are other factors like sun, heat, cold, stress, pushing yourself too hard etc that can cause your immune system to flare into higher states of activity.  Are you on meds currently?  The number 1 first line for most of us is plaquenil (hydroxylchlorinquine) which is an antimalarial and is supposed to help manage the progression of the disease.  It is hard on the eyes, literally, and takes at least 3 to 6 months to really start working.  Also, your vitamin D is probably too low like the rest of us.  Testing for it is expensive, but you are probably low and need to be supplementing.  Feel free to hit me up with questions, but really the FB groups are where it is as.  Good luck to you. No, I am not on meds, my doctor is concerned about putting me on meds because of my neurological symptoms and my age... And lifestyle wise I take D3, C and B12 and on the SCD diet. It is been really hard to push for testing in general (because my doc has been hung up on nervous system testing ,despite the fact my ana keeps coming back high, I do not have ms and I do have a family history of autoimmune disorders). ", "New MCTD Diagnoses (24F) Hello everyone,  so Im 24 years old, I started developing Raynaud's symptoms last year around September. As any 23 year old I ignored it in hopes of it going away. It did not. It anything it progressed, I had extreme body aches for no reason to where I could not bend my knees,my arms or use my hands because of the pain. I went to Texas for Thanksgiving week and when I came back to LA I was feeling a super sharp pain in my index finger and pain in both my knees like never before, it was so bad I could not sleep. The next day I went to work and noticed two fingers in each hand were purple, I left work and went to the ER cause I got freaked out, they literally just looked at it said \" Oh you have Raynaud's \" gave me a heat pack and sent me on my way. I felt like I was dismissed without any real testing being done so I called my doctor and asked for blood work. I got sent to a rheumatologist and she said I have MCTD, as naive as I am I just said ok and was pretty relieved that something was found and can be taken care of or at least managed. Im not 100% sure exactly what MCTD is and I have seen a lot of posts regarding secondary or something like that. I have only had 2 in person visits and the rest have been over the phone. I get really nervous and cant seem to come up with questions i want to ask or I simply just forget.\n Im here for two things really. \n1. What kind of questions should I be asking? I will be getting blood drawn in a few weeks and then have another over the phone apt on ctober 6th so I would like to write a few questions down and ask them. \n2. I feel good 90% of the time, I got prescribed 4 types of medications and recently they added  Vitamin D and Iron supplements so that makes 6. Im really just wondering if I feel good do I really need to take medication every day? ( excluding vitamins, theyre once a week)  I only feel pain when I do rough projects at work which is rare to be honest. Im fairly young and dont want to ruin my liver or anything in the long run.  Like I said Im very new to this and no one in my family understands,  they just think Im milking it or faking when I have pain so theres no one I can really ask questions to. Thank you for any advice you can give. It is bizarre your rheumatologist diagnosed without blood tests. Anyways if the blood tests do confirm it your rheumatologist would take baseline tests of all internal organs and check against it every 1-2 years. \n\nMCTD is manageable with right medications so do not worry too much about it. \n\nYou DO need the medications you are prescribed. Absence of pain does not mean your immune system is not attacking your organs. Do NOT stop your medication, ever, unless your doctor tells you that you have gone into remission and can try reducing medication. If you stop taking your medication you will return to that painful state you were in. Unfortunately there is no cure for mctd. It is lifelong once you acquire it. But it can diminish in severity in time with proper treatment. People who have stopped taking meds \u201cbecause they felt better\u201d ended up with kidney failure and need transplants. It depends what organs your body is attacking, but nephritis is a bad thing to have. You do not want nephritis. Listen to your doctor and do what they tell you to do. If their treatment plan does not do enough to help you in a few months, let them know. It does take time for the meds to work as they must build up in the body, you will likely need bloodwork done every few months forever now. Welcome to being a pin cushion \ud83d\ude01 it does get better. You need to take your meds even if you are feeling good. They will keep you feeling as well as possible for as long as possible and make bouncing back after a flare much easier. \n\nDo not Google MCTD because you will end up scaring yourself unnecessarily. \nMCTD is an overlap condition. It means you have symptoms of multiple conditions (lupus, arthritis, polymyositis, sj\u00f6grens etc) without actually having the full blown condition. Blood tests will allow your doctor to monitor your overall health and to see if one condition becomes more dominant. \nSome people say MCTD is a condition in its own right, others say it is like pre-lupus. \n\nYou are not faking it: your pain is real and valid. Unfortunately, you are suffering from a largely invisible  illness so people are not as understanding as they would be if they could see you had a broken leg or if you would lost your hair from chemo. \nI recommend Googling \"how to explain invisible illness\" and spoon theory. I am not a fan of spoonie culture and spoon theory is not perfect, but it is a good way of explaining to someone who has no idea. \n\nAsk your rheumatologist for resources to show your family. Ask them about what they are testing for and why and ask them about whether you need meds long term. \n\nDo not worry about your liver too much. You should be monitored regularly which will catch any abnormalities. \n\nI recommend an app like r/BearableApp so you can spot triggers, give your doctor a clear idea of what is going on and allow you to see your progress (ie how a new medication or supplement is giving you more symptom free days) Sorry I probably worded it wrong. I meant to say when I went to the ER they did not do anything,  they just looked at my hands and said \" oh you have this\" and sent me on my way. I felt dismissed too easily so that is when I called my doctor and requested I have blood work done and that is what lead to me seeing a rheumatologist. Thank you so much for all the information. I did get freaked out when I heard Lupus in the mix since I lost an aunt to that. But yeah I come from a Hispanic family and for us its like if you look somewhat normal and are laughing then you are faking it lol. It is what it is but I do have a few work friends and my boyfriend who understand. Thanks again.", "Achy legs Dose anyone have issues with your legs aching it is not restless leg syndrome it is just like from my knees down like the bone or beside the bones ache and it is so depressing to Google and read all the information medications. I personally am dealing with my MCTD with supplements only thanks bless all you soldiers I get achy legs all the time, especially when I am tired, like my lower legs, below my knees, almost like my bones are tired.\n\nI am only recently diagnosed, and have not gone on any meds yet, I feel like I have lots of weird little pains and ailments and do not know if they are my MCTD or not. For example, the gland in my neck below my ears gets swollen all the time etc\n\nGood luck with your management, I am kind of scared to go on meds, but I have been in pain every day for 18 months now, so might be worth it I guess? I get that feeling, like an ache deep in your shin bones. My thighs do not get the bony ache but I do get pretty intense muscle pains. \nMy lower legs are much worse when I am cold and I have found keeping my feet warm really helps. \n\nTaking glucosamine has helped a bit, but I also use hydroxychloroquine and naproxen. I have been diagnosed for 5 years but looking back I have had it for 10 doctors kept saying fibromyalgia and I kept saying no tried lots of different meds lost my job lost my insurance now I am just going with herbal supplements basically for stress and anxiety and using muscle vibrator thingy CBD lotion for pain CBD oil for anxiety I found that if I keep my anxiety stress down as much as possible it helps tremendously and take lots and lots of little rest do not push yourself I have named mine his name is Merv and when Merv says time to take a break take a break good luck honey do not be scared it is what it is we just have to manage it day by day. And yes all the strange aches and pains here and there that is part of it sometimes even my toes hurt and if you research or go on the Facebook page is it is very very scary I personally had to stop reading them because it will get you down best wishes hang in there thanks for your reply Yes! It is like the deep ache of menstrual cramps in one\u2019s lower back but in my legs. I get that ache in my lower legs, feet, and my forearms and hands.  Hands and arm pain came first, part of why I started seeing drs.  After thee years and multiple \u201cnormal\u201d blood tests, I was finally referred to a rheumatologist who did the test that finally indicated MCTD. You sound just like me. I have had pain for about 18 months now and just was diagnosed MCTD 2 months ago. I started Plaquenil at that time. I also made some big diet changes and started on some regular supplements. I do not know what else to do, my doctor's do not seem very concerned.  I hope you find relief and answers! Mine affects my tendons and ligaments causing weakness but arthritis was ruled out but this whole mctd thing it is kind of like let us spin the wheel see where we are going to hurt today I do feel much better not taking all the prescription medications and just using natural supplements good luck to you Yes that is exactly the way I feel it just feels like it is the bone even though I know it is ligaments and tendons. Also live with interstitial cystitis and that was strangely one of my first signs when I was getting ready to have a flare up but think the heavens that it is not interstitial cystitis I guess it is just part of the old mctd it is amazing and sad but this condition can control every aspect of life best wishes to you My Dr\u2019s are the same, do not seem to care at all What diet changes did you make - just out of interest Wow! What is up with that?! I am over here worried every day what the rest of my life will be like. Sure.  I started the AIP diet: no grains/added sugar/ gluten/ dairy/ nightshades/nuts. Pretty much meats, fruits, and veggies.  It was not as hard as I thought.  I started following a few Instagram accounts for recipe ideas.  I am thinking of adding almonds back in to bake with.  I honestly do not feel any better (about 6wks of the diet) but I know it is what is best for my body long term so I will keep with it for now. I get painful leg aches (side of calf) usually once a year and it lasts for about three weeks straight. I cannot tell you how many times I have gone to the ER over the years thinking it was blood clots. I was recently diagnosed with MCTD so perhaps that is what is causing mine. I have been undiagnosed for 30 years and to finally (and possibly) have an explanation for those legs aches is so validating. I use to think that also but never went to the ER. Like others said it seems like it is no big deal to some Dr. Best wishes", "Turns out I do not have MCTD after all Here is a full update to my misdiagnosis on my OP from 1 month ago. \n\n(", "Do you work full time? Hi everyone,\n\nI recently tested the waters and added more work on my plate to see if I could handle a full-time schedule. I actually ended up with a flare so I am back to part-time and my doctor said it is likely I will not be able to handle a full-time job, I just do not have the stamina for it.\n\nI am curious what each of you does for work. Do you work full-time? Part-time? Work from home?\n\nI am lucky to have my husband supporting us so I can take it easy but I used to have big dreams of a career and it does not seem likely to happen. My symptoms are not even terrible but I just do not have the energy to keep up most days. It is frustrating but I am trying to turn this into a positive thing. Maybe no full time job means I can make my own business, work from home, have more time for kids (when they happen). Thanks for reading! I am in my 50's and was diagnosed about 11 years ago. I used to work full time but had too many symptoms so had to quit. What mainly did me in was the crushing fatigue. My husband is well so I have him for support but I am on disability. \n\nFirst off I am sorry you are having to deal with this when you are young. But I applaud your attitude about it, I try to live my life the same way. In the large scheme of things I am blessed, I have a husband who loves me, two great kids, and whenever something new pops up, and people ask how I am, I reply \"I am still alive\" :-) and that is what I choose to focus on! \n\nSince you can work part time then just do that, I think it is great that you can. But just do what you can and become a master of listening to your own body whether it says \"great day let us go!\" or \"nope not today.\" \n\nWhat do I do? I am setting up a home biz with my grown daughter. I cook when I am up to it and do light housework. I go shopping with the family on days I feel OK. I have extra time for my young son to play Minecraft and Xbox with him and now we are doing summer school work. I have decided it would be good for his motor skills and attention span and legibility(!) if we worked on his cursive. Lo and behold, he is loving it! I let him use my fountain pen and we are having fun with it. In short I have the gift of time, I just have to use it differently from how other people use it. \n\nTakes care of yourself! I wish you the best. :-) Thank you for your detailed reply!\n\nI do sometimes feel like I am too young to be dealing with all of this, but I am trying to be positive. My husband is very supportive and is telling me to do whatever I want. If I want to work part time I can, if I want to try to open an at-home business, I can. I feel like, in a way, there are many more opportunities for me that I never would have thought of before being diagnosed.\n\nYour personal experiences give me hope too. It is good to know that fatigue is a big issue for many of us and that I am not alone. It is also nice to know what this may look like a decade down the road. It seems like by just being open to new experiences and thinking outside the box, you are able to live just as fully! Thank you so much for sharing. Im disabled, between the mctd and the bipolar.\n\nI have added more diagnoses since my disability was approved.", "Kidney ultrasound\u2026 Anyone know anything about the results of a kidney ultrasound? I had an ultrasound done and my doctor had it done urgently (stat) and told me he would call as soon as he got results to discuss but have heard nothing. I have the report and it has been weeks. Anybody that knows anything willing to message me privately to discuss? I would really appreciate it even if it is general guidelines on things to look for. Thank you very much in advance\u2026 I just got a kidney ultrasound and my Doctor did not call either, but he said he would not call if I did not need to do anything different. But if you were expecting a call from your Doctor, they probably should have got back to you by now. I would call and tell them you still need an explanation of your ultrasound. It is possible your file got set in the wrong pile or something.\n\nAlso, if you have a place where you see your test results, like My Chart, they do have some information in the test results that is pretty easy to understand. There should be some kind of red marker pointing to any tests that came back abnormal. Each test tells you what the normal range is and what your test result was. So you can tell if your value was either too high or too low, and then Google it (for instance, what does high Creatinine mean?). That could at least give you some idea what is going on. Good luck with everything! It is not like that all!! There is no \u201cnormal or abnormal\u201d. It is written in paragraph form which looks as though some abnormalities exist. He also said he would call immediately when he got the results. I did email his nurse and she told him to call. Very frustrating because I know something is not looking right but would like it explained. If anyone knows anything about ultrasound please private message me! Thank you", "Best gloves? For reynauds. \nPreferably form fitting and easy to do things with. (  compression fingerless gloves. They have them with and without grippies on the palms. Grippies are nice for everyday stuff but be aware you do not want grippies if you are going to be writing or drawing.

I do not have a favorite pair of gloves but over the holidays last year someone gifted me these ( \nThey are rechargeable, fit right inside your pocket, and get really nice and warm. I would not have survived the winter without these. Unfortunately, gloves do not cut it for me since my circulation is so bad that there is nothing to warm up the gloves in the first place.

I recently tore (well, tbd - awaiting MRI results but it seems likely) my hamstring seemingly out of nowhere. I am very active, but have kept things low-impact after my diagnosis earlier this year (indoor cycling, weightlifting, hiking, yoga). My hamstring popped and collapsed while I was getting ready to start a yoga class (was basically in tabletop pose).  \n\nTo add to this, my legs give out regularly. There is no associated pain, but it is pretty frequent if I am walking for any stretch of time (ex: walked to the grocery store and it happened about 5 times over the course of 20 min). \n\nI just had an EMG and any neuro issues were ruled out. \n\nCould these two issues: \n\n1) be related to one another and \n2) be due to MCTD? In my experience, moderate exercise is great if it is the right type.  Aerobic exercise with lots of movement -- road cycling, swimming, hiking, cross country skiing -- helps me a lot, but I have learned to stay away from anything not involving lots of motion, like weight lifting or yoga.  I recover better from exercise with sustained motion.", "Poll for the Community: Do you use Plaquenil? Inspired by another post as well as my own curiosity... Wondering how people have responded to using Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine). In the comments, feel free to expand. Would you recommend? How were the first few months? Have you ever stopped use?\n\n( I have been on it since June 2018. Have not noticed any physical difference or changes (positive or negative) in bloodwork since being on it. I have been on it since 2017. My rheumatologist tried halving it and I got much worse. My bloods are slightly improved and stable and while I do not feel good, I feel much better than I used to. \nWhile it does seem to be helping, there is talk of adding steroids or MTX which I am not overjoyed about. yes, i just started it! i have been on it for about a week, and i am really looking forward to some results! I was diagnosed and prescribed Plaquenil in July. I was on it until September. I had to stop taking it due to the medication raising my blood pressure and giving me bad chest pains. Now that I have been off of it for two months my blood pressure is back to normal. Would I recommend trying it? Yes, WITH the caveat that each person's body will react differently to any medication. Remember, you are not a statistic, nor are you the same as anybody else. Personal accounts from other people are helpful, and so are reputable studies, but you need to use your own body and your comfort level as a guide for what works for you and what does not. If you decide to try it, give it a good shot (take it for 6 months to 1 year, or whatever your doc recommends) but if you do not notice any improvement, do not assume you are somehow a failure. Also, if you have side effects that are affecting your life, even if they are \"uncommon\" or \"atypical,\" do not ignore them. As a very helpful (but now retired) rheumatologist told me, \"Any drug can have any side effect. Even a vitamin. It really just depends on the person.\"\n\nHow were my first few months? They were fine as long as I always took my pills with food and made sure I was hydrated. For many people, it can cause immediate GI discomfort if taken on an empty stomach. That was my experience, so I made sure to always take with food. I did not experience any noticeable relief from pain, fatigue, or any other symptoms in the first few months of use. I did notice improvements to my energy level after the three month mark, however, I feel it is important to say that I could not directly attribute it to the Plaquenil, as there were other medications and lifestyle changes I began around the same time. \n\nHave I ever stopped use? Yes. My doc and I were unable to tell if it was helping (I continued to have flares despite being on it for a year). I just came off it - per my doctor's advice - and the plan is to go three months without it and carefully document my symptoms/flares. It does take a while to fully leave the body, so only time will tell, but I am looking forward to having one less pill to take for a while. And if my disease suddenly gets worse, then I may have my answer, in which case I would happily go back to taking it. \n\nTL;DR: Do not be afraid to try it, but respect your body if it says \"no\" to Plaquenil after giving it your best effort.\n\nHope that helps. I have been on hydroxychloroquine for around a year or so? If it has given any benefit it is been subtle. \n\nMy hands when they were at their very worst were pure agony, limited movement, limited feeling and losing control, there were days I could not do up my shirt and I long gave up opening bottles and various other normal every day tasks you would never think of.\n\nI had a few steroid injections which helped dramatically changing my hands from a 1-2/10 to a 7/10 and I think? Maybe the hydroxychloroquine helped slow the degradation but they were still getting worse every day, just slower than before.\n\nSince then I have been put on methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine, they gave me a steroid booster before I started to help bridge the gap in time before the MTX would start working but I would say my hands are sat at around a 6-7/10 now for months.\n\nI was told by my doctor's hydroxychloroquine is rarely enough of an answer by itself but can be effective when used in conjunction with other treatments.\n\nThe MTX dosage has been increasing every few weeks  and even though I am injecting it rather than having tablets (due to stomach issues) the nausea and some of the other side effects in the the following couple of days can be rough. Even so I would take the MTX side effects in having right now in a heartbeat over the 24/7 agony my hands gave me and the fact I had not slept through a night in 18 months. I have been on Plaquenil for about 15 years. For the first 10 years it was my only med and I did not have too many symptoms, just recurrent pericarditis every few years. Whether or not that was due to the Plaquenil is hard to say.\n\nThen about 5 years ago my disease became much more active and I had to start immune suppression in addition to the plaquenil. \n\nPlaquenil is a disease modifying agent, so it may have pushed off the more active disease later or made it less severe than it would have been otherwise, but it does not seem like it has any effect day-to-day. I feel no different when I take it compared to days I do not, while i can really feel the difference if I miss the azathioprine (or prednisone, when I was on that).", "People with connective tissue disease have low vitamin D and hyper calcification.....but vitamin d can cause hyper calcification??? I do not know what to do? Should I take large dose of vitamin D or not? I was going to try 10,000-15,000 per day and was also planning on taking K2 with it..... to help prevent the hyper calcification.... Ask your Dr :/ I do not think anyone here can tell you what to do. Why would anyone tell anyone what to do? This is just a forum for discussion. Hope you have a good day. Apologies, your post sounds like you are asking for medical advice and I doubt anyone here is qualified to review your medical files and tell you whether to take vitamin d or not... Vitamin D deficiency  can be implicated in many conditions, but I would never take large quantities.  I would ask my very qualified doctor. thanks for sharing your views with me. have a good day. Your dr can run blood tests to determine the levels of vit d. You may not need or you may just need maintenance. Really it is dependent on lots of things, from diet to how much sun you get. But only your doc will know :) oh yes my doctor is not just \"very\" qualified. He is \"super doopie doo\" qualified. yes i am aware doctors run blood tests. thank you. Have you had a blood test to see how low your vitamin d levels are at the moment? At times I have needed 40,000 iu which is only safe to take for short periods, at other times, I am fine on a maintenance dose of between 4-8000 iu. Anything above 8000 iu should be guided by blood tests. \n\nTLDR; do not take anything over 8000iu without having blood work done by a doctor There is a few things to look at when these sorts of things pop up:\n\n1) The science linking VitD to hyper calcification appears to be linked to excess levels of vitamin D, or vitamin D toxicity (aka hypervitaminosis D). Appropriate supplementation and frequent lab testing should stave off this danger. \n\n2) The scenario above (in point 1) also seems particularly linked to patients with CKD. \n\n3) Medical science is still uncertain as to the role or function by which excess Vit D leads to hyper calcification (aka HC). Part of the problem stems from the research currently being limited to rodent (as well as goats &amp; pigs) and in vitro testing. \n\n4) Too less and too much of a certain item causing the same effect, fwiw, is known as biphasic response. Thus is the case with VitD and hyper calcification. Hence why the studies go further to look at other attributing factors such as: nicotine (a 10x to 40x increase in hyper calcification, generally specific to the aorta), over-supplementation of 500,000 IU/kg/day in rodents appears to cause HC in just 7 days after 3 consecutive days of supplementation, there may well be different reactions from various precursors to Ds (D2, D3). \n\n5) Overall, the VitD deficiency appears to cause more problems, quicker than regular prescribed VitD dosages ever could. More studies are underway with regards to comorbidities contributing to HC. \n\n6) The mechanism of the above is still lacking a complete understanding. \n\n\\*Also, as a reference point - 400\u2013800 IU (10\u201320 mcg) per day is the standard suggested non-prescription dosage. Well under toxicity concerns. AI patients are regularly prescribed 5,000 to 10,000 IU per day, also well under toxic levels. \n\n\\*As with all supplementation, it is generally NOT recommended that you add anything to your treatment regiment that is not prescribed by your medical team as they can affect other medications, as well as comorbidities. Thankyou so much for this, it is helped a lot.\n\nYeah currently it is difficult for me because I am trying to eat only sweet potato for maybe 5-7 days (started yesterday).  Sweet potato has a decent amount of calcium so I was worried about that potentially contributing to the hyper calcification (I read online do not take vitamin D with calcium for this reason).   \n\nSo yesterday I bought a D3 and K2 spray. And took 8000ui and 405 micrograms of K2 (K2 supposedly prevents the calcification in arteries/muscles)    also took a zinc tablet.\n\nToday I am planning on taking today I am planning on taking 10,000 ui with the K2, and an extra 5000 ui with no K2.  From the sounds of things I think the benefits outweighs the risks atm. I am taking this during a meal of 1,000g boiled sweet potato. \n\nThank you. My \"views\" are that you should stop posting shitty medical advice in various autoimmune groups on Reddit. Nobody can live off of sweet potatoes or should take mass quantities of Vitamin D without discussing adding it as a supplement with a doctor. I have reported your posts as spreading misinformation and violating group rules just FYI.  I have had my fair share of doctors appointments where I was dismissed, gaslit and lied to so I understand the mistrust of doctors. But you are just making things up and are not just saying what works for you. You are actively suggesting people go on unbalanced diets that have no proven benefit for autoimmune disease, and taking high levels of vitamins without medical monitoring. Nobody here is a child, and you are free to do whatever you want, but you asked for medical advice here and people responded by saying you should talk to your doctor and you are just being rude about getting those responses.    You are certainly welcome, but I am concerned about some of the efficacy of your reliance on the numbers above.\n\nIt is important to note that botanical sources of food give AVERAGES of nutritional values given a tiny sampling (14 specimens, to be exact), but they vary greatly due to the variety, growing conditions, weather, timing of harvest, and storage conditions, not to mention natural variation. So honestly, we can really only estimate how much of a given vitamin, mineral, etc are in each item. \n\nThere is obviously very little to be known about how much your body will then ABSORB from your eating habits. Some vitamins, minerals and so forth are rendered less absorbable from cooking - others more so. Lycopene from tomato is the infamous textbook answer for more absorbable. High calcium meals render the calcium LESS absorbable. Low calcium meals render the calcium MORE absorbable. \n\nFor those of us without a scientific background and struggling with AI issues, we are in rough guess territory. AI patients are infamous for our absorption issues, sadly. \n\nAnd to continue on the sad note, the same uncertainly as to the amount of a given vitamin/mineral, etc. often goes for commercially available supplementation. \n\nAnd all this is rendered moot, in so many ways, if you have not a VitD deficiency - the body will generally secrete it to expensive pee to the best of it is ability to do so.", "Poll for the community: How old were you when you first started to notice your MCTD symptoms? Hi all, trying to gage just what our community demographic look like. How similar or different are our experiences after all?\n\n( They started in my late teens, but I did not recognize that they were indicative of a real problem until I was about 20-21. I had previously thought I just had ridiculous back pain from slouching all the time, lol. How wrong I was... 10 or 11, I missed a lot of school when I was 12 and 13 while trying to get diagnosed. Basically they were waiting for me to start menses to see if I would go in a particular direction (mostly lupus) before they confirmed MCTD. It did not. Thanks for sharing! I hear you! For years I thought I was tired from depression, looking back I was depressed from being tired! Was not until other symptoms started to develop in my mid-twenties that I realized my exhaustion was far from normal. I was always warm growing up, but when I hit 15 or so I was suddenly cold all the time and forcing myself to keep up with others energy-wise. Everyone thought it was just anemia. The intense pain started to show up around 22, and I was diagnosed at 23. I also was fairly warm all the time up until a couple years before my symptoms started. Had not thought about that as a warning sign but definitely something I will be researching. Wonder, had. anyone else with MCTD noticed pre-symptom signs like shift in body temp/low desire for social interaction/etc.? Forgot to mention I also has Raynaud's, which is why I am usually cold, so I am not sure if temperature would affect those without it. Same here! Definitely noticed this too, I used to walk short sleeved back from school (in the UK) and was always hot. Around the time I got my diagnosis 2 years ago I would always be cold, colder than anyone else in the room. Not long after I developed reynauds syndrome symptoms. I am only 14 rn tho so do with that information what you will. Thanks for chiming in! It is a very interesting trend I would like to keep an eye on with other folks I got diagnosed in my early 30s, but I am pretty sure symptoms started in my childhood. I think I was just so active during childhood that it kept things under control. Getting to desk work is an adult seemed to really mess things up.", "Just diagnosed, what tests do I need? Hey fellow sufferers, I was just diagnosed with MCTD (and Sjogren\u2019s) a couple of weeks ago after suspected just RA. I am not sure where I will have the most involvement, but I have struggled with GI issues (diagnosed as IBS without testing), asthma/wheezing, and a fast heart rate before. Should I ask for those things to be checked out? I was already dealing with chronic illness before this so I am second guessing other diagnoses. \n\nI am a little bit at a loss. I would never even heard of MCTD before and literally my very first Google search about just what it meant lead to the scary prognosis number. I would love to live a long and happy life and just make sure my organs are not trying to self destruct. \n\nI currently only have a rheumatologist. Do I need more specialists? \n\nThank you in advance \ud83d\ude2d *Do not Google!* All you will do is leave yourself freaked out and feeling worse because of all the stress. \nMake a list of all your concerns and discuss them with your rheumatologist. They will refer you to other specialists if they think you need them and they may well be able to help you manage a lot of what is going on. \n\nYou are going to be OK; it is not fun but it is nowhere near as awful as Google leads you to believe. Also recently diagnosed and really needed to hear that. I am glad it helped. This sub is quiet but it is a brilliant resource. People answer honestly but in a way that is not scary. \nDefinitely reach out if you need support. Your rheumatologist will/should do a thorough testing of you via blood and vitals, and then will typically choose a medication for you to start and follow up with you every 3 months or so on average. Bloodwork labs will paint a much more clear picture for you if you have not already been tested. Ask your rheum - they will refer you to further tests or other specialists.\n\nPulmonologist and cardiologist are a common two once you get referred to them - so no need to stress out before your referral.\n\nOne thing you really have to keep in mind is that many prognosis numbers are not up to date and likely, people back then got diagnosed late into their disease. You already had medical attention due to RA. MCTD is so rare that most pharmaceutical approaches come from Lupus or RA. The aim of both is to slow down your body from distroying itself - so you will get there! The rheum will try just to do what you want there.\n\nLots of people with rheumatoid diseases get old. Stop googling life expectancy or lung involvement and, if you feel it works, adress your concerns with your rheum.\n\nSelf-help groups are also a big plus to see how people are coping.\n\nI wish you the best! What everyone else said! Your rheum should hopefully order you all the tests you need for baselines. Following my diagnosis, they had me get a DEXA scan, lung X-rays, ekg, and set me up with a nephrologist  who did some further blood and urine tests. I have not had those tests redone since (been 2 years), but I do see the rheumatologist and nephrologist every six months for check ins. \n\nWelcome to the club, I am sorry you are here, but we are here for you! I second this. While MCTD is a mix of different autoimmune conditions, a lot of the symptoms are milder than those in people with the specific disease. Googling it will only give you anxiety and for many people it is very manageable. I am doing quite well on medication. I agree that this sub is great! I would love to see it pick up a bit and I appreciate your thoughtful responses.", "258 members here with MCTD? Should do something with those numbers! Holy cow, if it is really 258 people with the actual disease, that is a lot of people with our rare disease in one place.\n\nI am really wondering if it made sense to do some semi-scientific statistics - something like onset age, time that passed until diagnosis, sex, home region, family history, therapy drugs, how your working status is (disability, part-time) and co-morbidity etc.\n\nWould need some external poll, would not it?\n\nI mean, data on MCTD is really sparse anyway. There is not even etiology data except the one study from norway (3.8 in 100,000 - derived from those numbers that would mean we practically represent all mctd patients of about 6.7 million people).\n\nAnother possibilty could be some storytime threads or something? But I do not know if that is way to personal for an anonymous place like reddit. I would love to participate in a poll and be able to look at all our demographics. I think it is be interesting.\n\nUnfortunately I think this sub is dead and most MCTD users frequent the Lupus and RA subs more often than this one. I would love it if this one gained more traction and participation. hello! i am here too, on behalf of my mother and i I would not mind doing my piece, especially since I felt very alone in it all (fell sick at 13, MCTD diagnosis at almost 18), if my story could help someone else going through it, why not?  \nBut the sub does seem dead, so...I am not sure how much response you would get. Here for my wife Here and ready to participate I am here too. Would love to participate too I am here! I would participate. You know, it is odd, I live in a rural county in Ohio and I have met two other people with MCTD just randomly. woah, that is amazing :O you basically won a prize in the lottery multiple times in a way XD\n\nIt is amazing how much motivation is there :) ! I wrote this in a bit of an overmotivation - there is a lot of privacy stuff to think of when you do a poll with sensitive personal info - at least in Europe, where I live. So I do not feel confident to pull it off in a way that is sufficient enough (unambigous answer options etc.).\n\nBut I definitively will check with the rheumatoid association of my country :) . Maybe they do have interest in starting an official mctd poll that can be posted. I know that they recently initiated a questionaire on patient-doctor-interaction, so there must be some kind of infrastructure (especially experienced staff) for that stuff. I am here tooo love to Participate I am sitting here waiting at the rheumatologist right now with all the fear and anxiety like usual smh lol"]
