["ETV Alternative to a shunt I was just curious to see if anyone has had an ETV. I had one done last summer and feel like I am still having the same symptoms I was before and have not seen much improvement. \n\nMy neurosurgeon said that most people after having an ETV feel immediately better and I was just curious to see if anyone on here may have had that experience.\n\nI have seen a lot of posts about shunts so I was just curious to see if there were any/many people here who had an ETV for treatment instead. ", "VP Shunt and Overdrainage Hello all,\n\nI am a 30 year old male that was diagnosed with a chiari malformation in 2015. I had surgery to correct that, but ended up developing hydracephalus post op and had to have a VP shunt put in. I got lucky the first 4 years, and did not have anymore symptoms. Then toward the end of 2018 I started getting headaches towards the end of the day. My neurosurgeon said that my symptoms seemed to be stemming from my shunt over draining the CSF. Fortunately, my shunt is the adjustable kind and they were able to adjust to the next setting. This did not seem to help my headaches so I had a revision in July of 2019. After my revision, the headaches seemed to go away for awhile, but returned about 2 months post op. My shunt was adjusted to the highest (most closed) pressure setting that it is capable of but I am still having headaches. The last time I had my shunt adjusted my doctor said it was possible that my hydracephalus had corrected itself and that it maybe necessary to have an operation to close off the valve completely. \n\nI am just curious if anyone out there has gone through this scenario, and if they had, what advice or thoughts you have regarding closing off a shunt completely. Dealing with this for the past couple of years has caused me to develop extreme anxiety and I am worried there might be another underlying cause for these headaches that has not been identified yet. Sounds like an interesting scenario. I got hydrocephalus in a similar way, post op for a cavernous malformation.  I wish I had some feedback or insight but just wanted to say I hope you get some answers and relief. I do not know of many people who have gotten hydrocephalus this way!\n\nEdit: guess I would ask, have you seen a neurologist?  Headaches could be unrelated. Typically surgeons want to do surgery.  I would check with a neurologist to see if you can rule out migraines or something else. I have not seen a neurologist yet but that has been discussed with my surgeon. Most likely my next step. Thank you for the well wishes. I hope your situation is going well! Highly likely it is drainage issues. Nearly everyone with a shunt will have drainage issues. I would skip the neurologist, they will do trial and error with meds. Based on your prior history it is your shunt. \n\nI have come across plenty of people who overdrain at the level you are at. There are one two types of valves they could use. Over drainage will lead to big issues down the line-Slit vents etc. \n\nWhat I do for my son is keep a headache journal. Time, weather etc.\n\nDo you get relief from certain positions? Is the headache long or brief? I have also heard about the trial and error method with meds and am not really wanting to go down that road. \n\nThe headaches usually start towards the end of the day and are gone when I wake up in the morning, which has led my surgeon to the conclusion that it is overdrainage. And since my shunt at the highest possible setting right now the next option they have given me is to have a minor operation to close the valve off completely.", "Medicaid qualifications Missouri? Hey everyone, Did anyone have a hard time qualifying for Medicaid in Missouri? I only recieve $7,200 a year before taxes so I cannot afford all my treatments, Not that I am ever really taken seriously because I am overweight. (Sorry off topic )If you later qualified how did you do it? I am so desperate to figure this out. I am over 3,000 in debt and its wreaking havoc on my credit score... I am willing to go   a bit further  into debt if that meant that I will finally have proper care.  (Sorry, some of that was a bit of a personal ran.)  ANYTHING will help!  Thanks everyone.", "Adult Hydrocephalus ETV Surgeons in Georgia/Tennessee/Alabama Long shot here, having bad headaches, agitation, all of that jazz, my GP has tried to get me into Vanderbilt with no avail, next try is Emory...seems like I am either an anomaly that no dr wants to take on liability wise or there just are not ETV doctors in the south (I am from NJ and my Neurologist put in my ETV 10 years ago at 23) \n\nIf anyone has any leads or knows someone who knows someone that would be great! Hello, I am sorry I do not have any advice for you, but I am curious. When you say you cannot get in with Vanderbilt, what do you mean? Do they look at your medical records and just say, no, I am sorry, we will not give you an appointment? I have a child with hydro, and I have heard horror stories about adult care, so I am curious about what to expect. They look at my medical records and they have not matched me with any neurologist. They have my records and a recent MRI. Apparently the wait to see a neurologist at Vandy is months and months out. Could you call a large hospital such as the University of Michigan? I would suggest you calling large well known hospitals to see if the Neurosurgery Dept would possibly look over your medical records for the ETV and possibly either suggest something for your Primary to do, OR they might as you to be seen at the U of M (in Ann Arbor, MI) or other well known neurosurgeons, possibly John Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, etc.\n\nYears ago (with different symptoms) I had to endure YEARS of going to doctors because they FLAT OUT refused to help me, as they continued to tell me that my symptoms were ALL in my head, that my constant anxiety over my DH having seizures that were VERY difficult to control was most LIKELY the reason for my medical issues!!! \n\nBy chance, I took my DD to our Primary where he noticed that I was not looking so hot. (BTW this is the SAME doctor who told me several times it was \"All in my head\".....which to put a \"spin' on this, it Actually WAS all in my head. I was diagnosed within HOURS after taking my DD to the Primary because she had Strep Throat.\n\n5 days after the Hydrocephalus diagnosis, I was shunted. The N/S that did my surgery said that my ventricles were HUGE....and had I not be shunted I probably would have  went to sleep 6-8 months later and would have died in my sleep due to the increased pressure within my brain.\n\nSo, keep trying....it is frustrating, timely, costly......but sooner or later, SOMEONE is going to take the time to LISTEN to you.\n\nI would start making notes as to what goes on every day for the next 30 days.....chart the food you eat, how many headaches you have had (per day, week etc) and what relief you were able to achieve, if any. \n\nAgain, I am sorry this has happened to you, but there are a lot of Drs. out there that sadly treat patients like this. It is not right nor is IT FAIR....but it happens! I suggest a nurosurgon not neurologist", "6 weeks post ETV\u2026 have some questions I had an ETV 6 weeks ago. I am booked for a follow up MRI in 4 weeks. I am still feeling very dizzy and really not myself. I am even feeling worse now than I did 2 weeks ago. I am so worried that the ETV failed and it was not worth it. Is this normal? Does this feeling ever go away? \n\nThank you in advance for any advice and for sharing your experiences. Hi I had an ETV 5 months ago\n\nI felt good immediately after the surgery, just like you. But after that I started feeling really dizzy and weak (for me I had trouble walking and sitting up it was so bad)\n\nFor me it took a few months to go away. It will go away gradually as your body adjusts so I would not expect to wake up feeling completely normal magically, it will be a transition. I still have my moments now but it is generally coming around. I would just say be patient. Think about what is going on up there, theirs the shock of surgery, the fact that your swollen brain/ventricles is now going down (even 6 weeks out there may still be some of that going on), and the fact that your brain has to get used to the lower pressure and the new flow of fluid. It is a little discombobulated right now but it will figure things out, you just need to give it time. \n\nHave you had headaches? My neurosurgeon told me that as long as I do not have a headache that gets progressively worse over several days I have no cause for concern. The same might also be the case for you Thank you so much for responding! \n\nI have not had any headaches. It takes some time! I just passed a year post my etv and at first I felt really off (could not focus, dizzy, overall just felt kind of weird) but now I can say I feel great, no more symptoms \nI think it can just take the body sometime to adjust, especially when you have had that pressure for a while\nI hope your journey goes well and you start to feel more normal soon :) Thank you for sharing I really appreciate it. I obviously need to be patient. ", "Anyone here with hydrocephalus in the radio broadcasting industry? How to break into radio if you have a disability\n\nI am 22 almost 23. Living in A rural small town in Massachusetts attending community college. I live at home with my parents. My parents knew that I might go to college and not finish because of two disabilities I have had practically since utero including a brain injury. I barely got through high school. I was in special education my whole school \u201ccareer\u201d. I am not dumb... I just have a lot of challenges. Anyways my school has certain rules set by the state of what classes I have to take for an associates degree. This includes 3 pre-college level math and science classes which I cannot pass for the life of me even after attending lots of tutoring up to 5 days a week.  Also I have only been taking 2 classes a semester and I have been going almost 3 years. I am about 40 credits in of the 65-70 I need. \n\n\nMy dream career is a radio dj. This used to be a profession that you could complete without a degree but I have been told that corporately owned Stations prefer a degree. They also have very limited internship possibilities. I got one small one when I was 16 through a vocational rehab program for people with disabilities but I aged out at 18. While I am still attending school I am going to apply for summer internships in the media and communications fields but who knows if I can get any. I am just not sure how I can accomplish this without college. I know I do not NEED college but In all the circles I have been in they said it is highly recommended. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nNow of course, we are in the middle of a pandemic. My school says they do not think they will open back up in person for at least two semesters. So I am stuck with what I can do. \nSo my parents and I think I will have to drop out or not return. My credits are good for up to 10 years. I would like to finish...I am just not sure it is possible.  I have Chiari and Hydro since age 2. 6 brain surgeries to fix shunt failures. \n\nI am in IT now fixing computers. I SWEAR one of those surgeries knicked a nerve and gave me that skill of computing, because I do not have a degree in it!! Lol\n\nI was always good at math, but I cannot write grammatically correct sentences for the life of me. Do what you can and you will get there! Grab some books at Barnes and nobles, watch YouTube videos on math/science courses. If YOU want to be a DJ, and have the passion to succeed, you will get there! \n\nThere is no rush in life, you can do it! Another avenue to think about - are there any community colleges near you that offer a broadcasting degree?  \n\nI know where I live the college radio station near me is pretty big and alot of students get into it that way. Unfortunately not. I am looking into an online certificate for broadcasting from any accredited institution My mom is a radio DJ as a side gig, she is been doing it since the 90\u2019s.\n\nHonestly, if your going into terrestrial radio, it is less important, but if you want to work for like a SirusXM station, networking is key, probably more than degree. Many jobs in that industry are obtained because a guy knows a guy kind of thing. Connections with industry people online will definitely help you out. Share your story, sometimes your drive alone can inspire a producer to give you a chance Thank you. That is really cool. I did apply for Sirius XM internships this summer. I also am planning to talk to a local DJ.", "Hydrocephalus and bipolar? Bare in mind, English is not my first language. \n\nMy mother got diagnosed with Hydrocephalus about 3 years ago, and since then, everything went downhill. I was 19 years old, living alone with her in our former apartment. One morning i woke up to loud noises coming from the living room. I stepped outside, and saw my mother walking around confused and crying her eyes out. I asked her what was wrong, but she could not explain and just kept crying. At that moment she barely knew where she was and none of her sentences made sense. It was just a big mixture of worries, that suddenly came to her mind. I had never seen this irrational behavior from her before.\n\nAll the windows in our apartment where open, and she had thrown some of our stuff out on the streets. I could not get through to her, and did not knew what to do, so i called 911. When the paramedic arrived, they checked her, and said it looked like an anxiety attack. She was still unresponsive to what was wrong, so they took her in the ambulance and drove off to the hospital. Since we did not own a car, i called my grand parents who i drove to the hospital with.\n\nAfter several hours at the hospital, she finally relaxed, and was able to talk with. She got diagnosed with 'excess water on the brain'; Hydrocephalus. She may have been born with it, but came to show now. The following weeks, she dealt with anxiety, which she got anti-depressive medicine prescribed for, which she still takes, but is not anxious anymore though. After a while, we went to the hospital to get her pressure checked. I could not be there, but i was told they ran some basic cognitive tests, and measured the pressure to conclude, that there was no need for a so-called shunt or drainage. It would cause more damage than helping her, i was told.\n\nThis happened in the first months, after the diagnosis. Afterwards and ever since she start developing, what i would call, bipolar symptoms. I do not know anyone that is bipolar, but her mood and mind runs in cycles. Usually weeks or months at a time. She is either really 'down' or really 'up'. Depressive or manic. You are not in doubt on which 'cycle' she is in, and you easily notice when she changes. The contrast in her moods are so strong, to the point where she cannot live a normal life anymore. Her doctor is just treating this as a brain damage, and there is nothing more to do. I have mentioned the bipolar symptoms, but she says there is nothing to it, ''it is just a brain damage and there is nothing to do''. The only medicine she takes, is the anti-depressive, which is a low dose. Sometimes, her doctor regulates the dose. I cannot see why, cause it does not changes anything. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this? Heavy mood swings like the symptoms of bipolar disorder, linked to Hydrocephalus? Could a shunt or mood stabilizing medicine help her? If anyone knows what to do to help and ease these symptoms, please write.\n", "Does the weather ever affect how you feel? ", "VP shunts and flying Hey what is up everybody, I recently got a VP shunt in November and had a revision in February, this is going to be my first time on a plane since then.  I am nervous about the change in pressure and altitude, a few months ago I went to Smokey Mountains and the change in altitude during the drive up made me nauseous and lightheaded.  I know that I cannot go through magnetic scanners but any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance Based on my limited research, the aircrafts cabin is pressurized to a level that equates to being at 8,000 ft. The highest altitude of the Smokey Mountains is a little over 6,600 feet. I would speak to your neurologist or neurosurgeon about any way to relieve the symptoms that you experience with the change in elevation. Thanks, I spoke with them yesterday, they assured me I was good to fly and that I could take over-the-counter medication\u2019s for any discomfort, I am still nervous about it, having this shunt saved my life but it makes me a lot more cautious about regular activities I flew to texas some time after my vp shunt revision and i felt fine but im told hydro hits everyone different so air on the safe side Cool thanks will do Good luck in your travels I have had a VP shunt my whole life and had no trouble flying, sometimes within 7 weeks of a revision. I live in Australia and fly across the country at least once a year which is a 5 hour flight and I have gone to Europe a few times as well which was 14 and 11 hour flights. I have had VP Shunts my whole life and I have no problems flying. \nJust when you do fly chew gum and bring ear phones cause of the pressure. Also, just let the security guards know that you have a magnetic valve in your head and a female guard body scan you. Awesome thanks, this helps put my mind at ease Got it will do, thanks I asked my consultant about this a week or so ago. \nBackground - My shunt is fine as none programmable but my head is very full. my tumour partially removed but developed hydrocephalus. Cyst then filled space made from removing tumour but the shunt meant I am not really feeling the impact of that. Hence the very full statement. \n\nI do know that I feel it with weather changes and so imagine now i would feel altitude changes too. My plan is to try a smaller flight first. My consultant had said everyone is different re if cabin pressure has any effect on them but if I did feel anything it should only be temporary I.e. go back to normal once landed etc .\n\nEveryone is different but I would check with them. I am a nervous person so reckon I will try and very short flight first ( longest j did pre tumour / shunt was 4..5 hours) \nGood luck Thank you, I actually just landed, everything is good just some slight discomfort on take off but everything else is fine, thanks again", "Tubing pain in neck Hi everyone! \nI have a vp shunt and last year the tubing was redirected from draining from my stomach to into my chest cavity instead. Recently, I have been having extreme neck pain along the tube, but there is no redness or swelling, just intense pain that does not seem to go away no matter what I do. I went to the emergency room and they said there is nothing visibly wrong, but the tubing around my neck is still tender to the touch and extremely painful. Does anyone have any experience with this? If so, is there anything I could possibly do to relieve the pain besides Tylenol, Advil, etc.? Thank you in advance! I could only suggest getting checked by a specialist. Maybe there is an infection or I had a thing once where my shunt slipped and caused head pain whenever I moved my head left because it pulled on the scar tissue. Can you feel where your valve is? Is it in its normal place. And is there any bumps you can feel if you follow the tubing, I have this weird thing where the tube makes an arch in my chest that feels like a lump but is the tube. I get this same tenderness/pain in the area of my neck where my shunt tubing is. Usually it will subside with time and ibuprofen. Otherwise, alternating applying heat and cold sometimes helps (but sometimes not). My last ditch effort which rarely helps but is worth a shot is trying something like a foam roller (though you should take care with this because it can make the pain worse).\n\nHonestly, you might just consult with your neurologist/neurosurgeon. They might have more specific ideas, whereas an emergency room is not necessarily equipped to help if their standard tests do not turn up anything (my most recent example would be having a broken shunt but being given literature about caffeine headaches because my shuntogram was negative \ud83d\ude30). Yeah better safe than sorry. Infection can happen  quickly if not caught. Feel and look at the entire shunt tube track up to the shunt. Take a phone flashlight and see if any abnormal squishy spots are there that were not before. Monitor symptoms. Fever and pain with discoloration from tube occur immediately go to er and let neurosurgery know of possible  shunt infections. \n\nHope you feel better. When I had neck pain like that around the tubing it was because Scar tissue had formed around the tubing and because I did not know it was there, ripped the shunt free from the scar tissue. Caused pain for probably a month to two months. If you think this is possibly the case you should see a specialist so they can be sure the tubing is not damaged.   \nFeel better! Thank you for the advice! I will definitely give my neurosurgeon a call Thank you for your reply! Was there anything that helped with the pain at all? A warm compress sometimes helped. Just get a washrag or small towel warm (I used a \"microwavable\" stuffed animal, this added a bit of weight to the warmth.)  \n\nJust be safe! And I hope you feel better soon! Hi there, I get this quite frequently and have had it checked by my GP and consultant. Unfortunately because my VP shunt is not fixed in place, it can \u2018dislodge\u2019 itself from time to time and make the entire side of my neck and head very tender. I prop myself up with pillows and rest a bag of ice on it very gently. Medication like codeine really helps as well. Other than that it is just a case of sleeping and keeping well rested. What others have said about scar tissue may be a very real possibility - as I have had this same shunt for 25 years. \n\nI am sorry I cannot be more help but I am sending tonnes of love and sympathy!", "Ramble dump: 30 years old and have not seen a doctor in about 15 or more years Hey everyone, so I have had a vp shunt since birth. As far as I can remember it never had to be replaced at all, has not failed at all, etc. I have had a couple spells of dizziness last year, lasting roughly two days, but that was it, really. Genetically I think I am carrying something my grandma gave me, since she suffered from dizzy spells frequently around my age. But I should not rule out the shunt on that.\n\nI have not seen a regular doctor in a while due to inexperience with the system as an adult, I guess. But I need to change that if I want to make sure this shunt is still in working order, or needs replacement, etc.\n\nHas anybody else had a shunt last a long time? From everything I have ever read on them, they sound like they are fragile or need frequent replacement, but that has not been my experience with mine. But I guess I could have asymptomatic problems with it right now and I wont know until its checked out.\n\nHonestly I forget this thing is even in me due to the lack of issues I have had with it. There is a lot of people who have never had a revision.\n\nTo make sure your shunt is still working properly, you might want to set up an appointment with a Neurosurgeon. (Check your insurance to see if you have to have a referral from a Primary care physician BEFORE you make the Neuro appointment though.\n\nYou will probably undergo what is called a Shunt Series. This is a series of x-rays that are done by having you lie in certain positions, etc. \n\nYou are right, you might have dizzy spells genetically, but then too, there is hundreds of reasons why you have had a couple of dizzy spells such as being dehydrated, symptoms from the flu, not eating properly, etc. People sometimes get dizzy due to high (hot) temperatures, etc. There is a lot of reasons why people have dizzy spells, inner ear infections, etc. \n\nYou should make an appointment with a neurosurgeon due to the fact that it is in your best interest to have up to date records, up to date tests to make sure all is well.\n\nGood Luck.\n\nPS....The Hydrocephalus Association might be the best bet to find a doctor in your area that deals with shunts. That is the first step I would make due to you not being seen by a neurosurgeon for years. Usually if there is not anything wrong, most doctors will have you do follow up appointments with them every 2-3 yrs. I am in the same boat around 17 or 18 my paediatric neurosurgeon said I do not really need to worry about going for yearly appointments until things go wrong ... I have an adult neurosurgeon now but it is the same as needed situation Oh man here is the fun thing. I have actually been trying to get a primary care physician but that is been it is own adventure outside of this subreddit.\n\nSo I had my roommate help me out and set me up with a primary care physician back in February before covid hit the US hard.\n\nA couple business days before my appointment was supposed to happen, they called me and I didnt pick up. In this call, they left me with a message saying to call back because they double checked the appointment date, and the doctor would not be in. So they wanted me to reschedule. \n\nI spent the whole rest of the next week calling and never getting an answer or call back from the office. So I am still sol on a PCP. You are lucky! Shunts have a high failure rate. Yeah that is what a lot of material I come across online suggests. \n\nConsidering I dont have a PCP, it blows my mind that I have not had a failure and havent had to have an operation since I was an infant in 1990.\n\nI believe someone has said it is also a matter of \"when\" it would fail on a long enough time frame, not \"will it or wont it\". Considering it is an implant and no bodily implant lasts forever. Such a long time without changing the shunt system is possible.\n\nGot my first shunt with 7 yrs (VA shunt with unkown valve type but most likely Holter valve)\n\nThat failed after 19 yrs and was replaced by a VP shunt with Holter valve again. Unfortunately no overdrainage protection as this was unkown at that time. Living now since more than 30 yrs with that shunt system. But the overdrainage has caused massive slit ventricles and the system cannot be revised.  \nSo crossing my fingers that the system will last some more days.\n\nMy understanding as a non-professional ist that these old valve type are very simple and cannot fail too much. Modern valves are high technology with lot's of potential failures modes. Some days ago I had a surgery as I had some problems. The doctor proposed to keep the valve system if possible. They do not have real good experience in changing valve system. I was lucky that they could solve the problem without touching the main shunt system. I am 38.  \n\nMy first shunt was at 6 (Mar 1982) months but failed, my second I had from 9 (Jun 1982) months to 14 years, and I have had the 3rd shunt since age 14 (Feb 1996).  Have not had a revision or failure since then.  It is important that you follow up on time per your neurologist/neurosurgeon.  The failure rate is high but do not worry, you are not alone here. Yea I finally called back the PCP I meant to see in February so this will be getting back on track soon.", "2nd Shunt Revision Surgery I just wanted to remind everyone here to not disregard possible symptoms of shunt failure! I went through an entire week of headaches, pain, and nausea until I finally decided to go for an MRI three weeks ago.  I then had my entire shunt system replaced and I know I probably should feel grateful that it is only my second surgery and that many people on this sub have had way more, but this is just a PSA I guess. I am so glad you are better back in 2009 I suffered from Thanksgiving to After New Years until my mom took me to Vanderbilt Medical Center to been seen  come to find out mine malfunctioned and had to be replaced I again had a episode back in July it was my appendix and it ruptured but because I had the shunt in my belly I was supposed to have surgery July 18th and still had icky in my belly and finally had it on July 25th they took it out of my body for those three weeks from July 6th to the 25th it is now going to my heart not my belly I take an aspirin everyday to make sure blood platelets do not block the catheter but I am doing great 8 months post op two days ago I have had 4 of these and am just 28 god bless you friend How did it work out with the pandemic in the hospital?

And 9 days later the WHO labeled it as a pandemic.", "My dad can no longer communicate after getting a VP shunt put in. My dad, 64, had a massive brain bleed two weeks ago caused by high blood pressure. He was stable with two (exterior) drains in for 10 days to help with intracerebral pressure and bleeding, and he woke up from that surgery still able to communicate. Then they took him for surgery to put the shunt in about a week and a half later, they had to remove the drains, but could not leave him without any form of drainage since his body needed in, so they did the shunt). I do not know what happened, but he stopped communicating. He just stares now. I do not know if it was the anesthesia, medications, or what. My poor dad can no longer communicate. The neurosurgeon and neurologist are puzzled. I am so devastated. He just stares. He is now on anti seizure medication and meds for the excess blood to get absorbed in his brain. Did not any doctor find a possible reason for it? Maybe once the pressure lowers whatever is inhibiting the brain to communicate will get normal again. No. They do not know why this happened :( I am not a doctor so my reasoning is as valid as anyone's, but there are lots of circumstances where the brain is put in a stressful state and shuts things down, only to recover some time after. Trauma, physical or mental, will do this.\n\nDo not lose hope and keep pressing every doctor you can to find answers! Thank you! Did the staring start before or after the seizures? After. No confirmed seizure, it was seizure-like activity after the surgery In my opinion, I am Not A Doctor, However, It could be his brain needs time to heal or swelling needs to go down yet from the bleeding. Do not loose hope. \ud83d\ude4f I had a grand mal seizure the day they put my shunt in about 3 hours after I was taken into my room. I almost died that day. I swear I saw the \u201clight\u201d that time. I still have occasional seizures, it took almost a year to get the right medicine to get me controlled. The brain is so complex.", "My non-functioning shunt is a pain in the neck (literally) I have a non-functioning VP shunt that is been there since I was 5 months old. I had obstructive hydrocephalus that was fixed by surgery when I was 2, so after that point the shunt was not needed so my neurosurgeon left it there and it eventually stopped functioning.\n\nI am 19 now and I do not plan on removing it because it would be an insane hassle, but it is been annoying me lately. If I move my neck wrong I can feel it, and sometimes after waking up from sleeping I realize I pissed it off somehow. Sometimes it just aches or feels tight.\n\nIt is probably calcified and covered in scar tissue by now - I am not super worried about it, just wondering if anyone has any tips for alleviating the irritation. Heat packs and ibuprofen have helped me ease shunt pain in the past! Thank you! Ibuprofen is a go-to, but did not think of heat packs for some reason.  My shunt is only a year old and since the day it has been placed it has been a constant pain in the neck. It is so tight. I cannot stand it I feel your pain! It is weird because it is not bad enough for me to consult my neurosurgeon, but it is annoying On the off chance you are doing this:  rubbing or massaging my tube makes it hurt more. I was doing that. I will stop, but it is tempting to do that since you would think it would make it feel better but it makes it worse! Yeah I thought so too. It may just bother the things around it when we do it, I dunno?", "I have been diagnosed with autism since I was 20, now I am being told it is this instead, and that it will cause early dementia. Please help. I got a brain MRI in May die to possible seizures and it took until now to get an appointment where someone could actually explain the results to me. The neurologist said I had hydrocephalus that \u201cresolved\u201d and left holes(?) on the sides of my brain, which is characteristic of people with dementia, but it must have happened long enough ago that my brain created more folds to compensate for it so I never got major dementia symptoms. He said my autism symptoms (which affect me really really severely) are probably better explained by the hydrocephalus. \n\nThe MRI also showed no evidence of seizure activity but an EEG says I have unnatural brain waves that give me a lower seizure threshold, so I have a good chance to develop them in the future. \n\nDue to these two things my neurologist says I will likely start getting seizures and subsequent dementia starting in my 60\u2019s. I am terrified. \n\nCan hydrocephalus cause things like sensory issues, \u201cbig emotions\u201d, stimming behaviors, etc? Or do I have both autism and this? Or should I seek a second opinion on the brain MRI? I could see the holes and when he compared them to MRI pictures of elderly people with dementia, it looked similar. I would personally get a second opinion, any mention of needing a shunt? No. He assumed I would had one when I was a kid and seemed surprised when I told him I definitely have never had a shunt. He described the hydrocephalus as \u201cresolved\u201d which is a red flag to me. From what I can put together, I had it as an infant and then it randomly became \u201cno longer detectable\u201d. \n\nThis is only the second time I have seen this neurologist so I do not trust him yet. I would get a second opinion. Hydrocephalus is a pretty broad diagnosis resulting from a variety of scenarios. What you are describing is not one I have heard before, so while your neurologist may be correct I would still poke around for a second opinion. Thanks. I will try. Hydrocephalus can give you memory loss and concentration issues, which are also symptoms of dementia, but its usually less severe.  I have also heard it can cause autistic tendencies (as i was told but cannot find much info on it online) but ive not heard it causing dementia itself. I am not a doctor but according to your post your doctor did not mention pressure, spinal fluid, or ventricles in this post at all which makes me think you need another opinion Correct, he did not mention any of those things at all. Thanks I would get a second opinion. Hydro can resolve itself. I myself had it happen as a child. I was scheduled for surgery to have a shunt put in and when they did another follow up scan the fuild had arrested. \n\nAgain nothing wrong with seeing a different doctor. Yeah...find another doc.", "I have a few questions and was hoping to get some answers. &amp;#x200B;\n\nTo make a long story short I was diagnosed back in the early 80s when I was about two or three years old. About a week or so before I was scheduled to have a shunt put in they did another head CT and told my parents that it appeared the excess fluid just vanished and they had no idea what happened to it. \n\n So my first question, can the fluid just kind of clear up on its own without any type of intervention? My reason for asking this is all throughout my life I have suffered with immense headaches and extreme nausea.  I had to go through speech therapy because I had difficulty with certain sounds. \n\nI am now 40 years old and I am looking back throughout my life trying to make sense of things. My husband recently passed away in December and he was adamant that I still suffered from hydro. I am tired all the time. I will mix up simple words, even mispronounce words that are not even difficult. It will sometimes take me 3 or 4 tries just to get the easiest word out or I will skip it completely.  My vision is becoming worse and things are becoming more blurred. Even now when editing this post it is extremely hard to do because things are blurred together. I still get nausea for no reason, light headed and migraines that at times will put me in the ER. I sometimes have difficulty talking and will slur my speech. Tonight I was talking with my daughter about me being tested and was slurring words. Even she noticed it and said something. My daughter is 9! There are also times where my arms just feel off. It is hard to explain.\n\nEver since getting covid my migraines have gotten even worse. Normally I can just wait them out (there are few that I cannot) but in March I was at the hospital. My son woke up to me vomiting in the bathroom and was worried about me. I realized I needed to get checked out. They recommended I follow up with my PCP to see about starting medication to prevent the migraines. \n\nMy PCP was since left so I saw the new NP. She has OCD which is a good thing. She scheduled me for an MRI based upon my passed history and the other complaints. I am waiting for insurance to give approval. \n\nSo the next question is; is it possible that it is been there the whole time? Could the scan maybe have not been clear cause as a small child I was moving around too much?\n\nWhat can I expect moving forward if they do find something? I am so worried about having to have surgery as I am now a single mom of 2  and cannot really be down and for long. Also, my father developed hydrocephalus after having a tumor removed and he fell and hit his head the night after surgery. He had a shunt put in and it caused so many other complications. \n\nAnd is it possible to be genetic? My son who is 10 has been complaining about headaches recently. He did not start talking till he was almost 3 and has been in speech till he graduated this past January He has poor academics and a lack of focus. He claims that things blur together. He was diagnosed with ADHD-I, but reading up on symptoms for kids it seems that he could cross off some of those boxes. His ped did also order a head ct for him just to make sure everything is clear, because I am always paranoid as a parent. \n\nI know what it is like to be told your headaches are nothing and just made up in your head. Consider the plumbing of your cerebrospinal fluid. It gets made it in the little pockets inside your brain, the lateral ventricles. It pulses and flows out from there down the narrower third ventricle, then goes down a little skinny aqueduct tube to the 4th ventricle. From there there are a few smallish outlets where the fluid escapes these pockets inside the brain and gets out and around your brain and spinal cord, bathing and protecting it. Hydrocephalus means that the plumbing is not working right and the fluid is getting backed up inside the pockets of your brain, creating a build up pressure that takes up space and stretches and irritates your brain, either because your brain is making it too quickly, or because something is excessively narrowing or blocking fluid movement, or sometimes a little of both. \n\nIt is feasible that a fairly minor hydrocephalus could clear up on its own, especially as you grow and get some minor shifting of anatomical structures in your brain. That being said, if there was something that was narrow enough to cause hydrocephalus once, it would definitely increase your risk of having it again. I definitely think you need that MRI with the symptoms you described. Hydrocephalus can indeed be genetic. You might consider asking your pediatrician for a referral to pediatric neurology for your son. Do you have more medical info about hydro being genetic and what is the current status about the research on the topic? It depends on what level of information you are looking for. The very short of it is that just over 50% of hydrocephalus cases are considered to be congenital, but the inheritance is usually--probably?--multifactorial with several \"risk genes\" creating an increased chance of experiencing hydrocephalus, and the less other \"syndromic\" features you have, the less likely you will find a one gene answer to \"why is this?\".  So the \"status of research\" on it is like most things--complicated, nuanced, and not immediately summarizable unless you are approaching it from a particular perspective.\n\nFor example, if the question is \"what do genes say about whether I might benefit from a shunt,\" there was a recent short article in Nature Medicine (DOI 10.1038/s41591-020-1120-0 \"Unlocking the genetic complexity of congenital hydrocephalus\") that notes that most of the genes we know of so far to be associated with hydrocephalus have a factor of aqueductal stenosis -- that is, part of the thin channel that delivers the CSF over the brainstem is stiff, scarred, or somehow less compliant and more likely to cause blockages. They find that congenital hydrocephalus genes seem to have two big classes, one that is due to impaired CSF circulation, and the other that is due to abnormalities in how the brain cells grow, reproduce, and take on their own special characteristics (differentiate). Shunts are more likely to be useful for the former than the latter.\n\nI suspect what you want to know about is more \"Can I get testing done for me/my child,\" and the answer is, maaaaaaaaybe yes? The major medical genetics companies I use in my clinic, Invitae and GeneDx, do not offer a specific hydrocephalus panel yet. There are panels out there from other companies, e.g. Prevention Genetics has ( although when I go through the genes tested there a lot of them are more focused on syndromes that cause hydrocephalus, so if hydrocephalus were the only syndromic feature it might not have a great yield. There are some other panels out there too that I am not so qualified to comment on, so seeing a neurogeneticist or medical geneticist would not necessarily be a bad call. If you have more specific questions on research or genes in your head, feel free to ask.\n\nObviously I do not know all the specifics of your case, so take this as \"not medical advice\" abstract speculation. But in your scenario it seems you should a) get your own head imaging done and speak with an adult neurologist b) get a referral for your child to be seen by a pediatric neurologist (start on that now, they can take MONTHS to get you in in many areas) and hopefully you will have your imaging results in the meantime, and then c) If anything abnormal comes up on your own imaging, the peds neurologist will have a stronger reason to look into imaging for your kiddo, and d) if something abnormal comes up on both you and your kiddo, they may have reason to do a closer medical exam and either send a genetic panel themselves or refer your kiddo on to a medical geneticist so they can do a better family history and a more nuanced exam of you both.", "New Shuntee Hello fellow hydro patients/shuntees!  As of November 10th I have a shunt. Yesterday was my first revision where I had a programmable valve put in (literally shortest surgery I have ever had - 15 minutes!). I have had hydrocephalus since I was 12 because of a brain tumour that cannot be fully removed and I had an ETV to treat it. Well, after 8 years my ETV seems to have stopped working as I was having symptoms of hydrocephalus again so my neurosurgeon decided to put in a shunt. I was in a lot of pain and I could not even move because I would get headaches &amp; hot flashes after it was first put in, but after it is been changed to a programmable I am feeling a lot better. I am feeling really disappointed about the fact that I could not just live with an ETV though, but I hope that will pass. Hydrocephalus is such a frustrating condition! Sorry your etv did not keep working but so glad you are feeling better!  Thank you so much! Just found this sub, sorry to hear that. Shit is rough. I am 7 years into shunt life (one valve replacement). Hope things go well for you!  Thank you! Hope things continue to go well for you also!", "Shunt question Hello everyone. I have a question. I am 22 almost 23. I have had a shunt in my head since I was 5. I have yet to have it replaced. My neurosurgeon seems to think i will not ever need it replaced and will not need to come in to get MRI\u2019s unless I think somethings wrong. My question is does anyone think I will my shunt will eventually fail and I will need it replaced? And I am not crazy by deciding to still get a MRI every 2 years to Double check how my brain and shunt are doing? \n\nThanks in advance! I had 3 operations before I was 2 and then lived a relatively 'normal' childhood/adolescence. Headaches became a problem after puberty and then when I was 21 I had a headache that hospitalized me for almost 3 weeks including a shunt revision which became my 3rd shunt.  Keep an eye on yourself. Always. Im the complete opposite. Ive had like 10 surgeries now and im 20, with the last one being 4 years ago. If I were you i would get the test just to be sure but im assuming you are from the US so it is going to be very expensive. If you are from the US, honestly, just check yourself when the symptoms hit. Good luck from Mexico \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd.\n\nPs. It might be cheaper to come to Mexico and get the tests here . You do not need a MRI unless there is a problem, like headaches, new pain, vomiting, etc. If you have pressure build up you will get symptoms. \n\nYou have gone a looooong time with no shunt issues. It could be that your ventricles started absorbing the fluid again like they are supposed to. It happens sometimes! So they leave the shunt in because it does not do any harm. Or maybe your shunt is lucky and has just kept working awesomely. Unfortunately there is no way to tell if your ventricles are working or I would the shunt is still doing the work. But if there are no symptoms they will not do anything. I have heard that shunts tend to fail every 10 ten years. Im 35 and never had a problem with my shunt that ive had since birth.  Ive heard of people in their 50s that havent had any issues.  If things go wrong you will show some symptoms, though they can vary and appear to be something else like flu.  Things wont go badly wrong over night so you get plenty of time to sort things out.  Get an MRI scan every 2 years if you feel it helps keep your mind at rest but ive never had mine checked and alls well. Yes. It will most likely fail at some point. One vp shunt I had lasted 29 years. In 2016, it failed in that 29th year with it and I needed to have a new shunt put in and then that new shunt failed 4 months later. Keep vigilant for malfunction symptoms and get to an ER if they show up.", "Um, my shunt is starting to calcify, is that normal??? My shunt is starting to undergo the very slow process of calcification, should I be worried? I have a small sort of soft bulge on the side of my neck. You should most likely see your neurologist.  Ok Ok Yes. I had that problem. Mine broke in 4 places. Ended up having it partially removed since it had become imbedded, calcified, into the muscle. It was really painful for me. They gave me an ETV, too. \n\nIt had gotten so bad that I could not look behind me in the car while driving because of the pain. \n\nIf it starts to hurt you, and they will not do anything, do not stop until you find someone who will. My shunt of 20 yrs calcified to my collarbone. It failed shortly after we discovered it but they said the failure was due to the fact it was an infant shunt I have a tube that is severely calcified, and there would be times where it would bother me so much I would cry. Due to where the crack was and how old my tube is however, doctors said they do not want to remove unless they absolutely had to. If it is your shunt however I would talk with your parents or a neurologist to see if they can do anything. I have two shunts and one of them has not been working for years and I am still able to live as normal of a life as anyone with Hydrocephalus. But there are many factors that play into it all. I wish you the best and hope you get it sorted out!", "How does \u2018stable\u2019 hydrocephalus work? I have been shunted since birth but my hydro has stabilised now and my neurosurgeon said I probably do not need it anymore. \n\nDoes that basically mean, yes I have the excess fluid but it can drain itself (without a shunt)? the dream I have had a shunt since birth.  When I was around 10 years old we were told I had outgrown the condition.  The  doctors left the shunt in place and it was never looked at again and hydrocephalus was never considered when I had any medical issues.  Well, in 2017 my \"inactive\" shunt malfunctioned, but the docs took too long to test my CSF because they did not think my shunt was necessary.  Clearly, it was.  I lost my vision as a result.\n\nMy point is - do not do anything drastic, and, while I hope you HAVE overcome the condition, always keep it in mind going forward so the same thing does not happen to you. Oh my god, that is awful! How are you doing now? My neuro said to not take it out as 1) I have been ok (no debilitating headaches) for about 7-8 years and 2) why have risky surgery if nothing is actually wrong and I may actually need it in the future if something happens I am doing well.  I am  considered disabled now, so I can no longer work ()I cannot drive anymore), but now that I have a functioning shunt, I no longer have back pain or headaches.  For years they thought my headaches were sinus related because no one even considered my shunt.  So, I am glad you will be keeping yours.  I would  still have neuro checkups every few years to ensure it is still in working condition in case you ever need it again.  Your neurologist has the best plan, it sounds like! My most recent checkup (in 4 years) was because I noticed a lump on the side of my neck where the shunt is and although I was ok, it still freaked me out so my mum and I went to the ER and I got an X-ray and ultrasound and they said it looked like debris or scar tissue and there could be a risk of infection but the lump actually went soon after (without me doing anything) and when a neurologist examined me he said I may not need the shunt anymore as even with my shunt being migrated, I have not had problems. I have never had a shunt, my hydrocephalus was not discovered until I was 13 (due to medical neglect) as a child until about age 9 or 10 I would have bad days where I would throw up all day and have horrendous headaches. I actually count myself very lucky because it could have gone very wrong. Really depends on why you have hydrocephalus .  For me, I have a benign tumour in a ventricle, recently I asked my neuro surgeon if the shunt was even working, he said if it was not I would be dead. I had a severe intraventricular hemmorhage at birth which led to post hemmorhagic hydrocephalus", "Como proceder?

My abdominal stitches itch every so often. I cannot speak for everyone but it is normal for me. The shunt is not supposed to be there, really, so I figure it is just my body kicking up a minor fuss. Any other symptoms such as a high temperature or redness along the tubing path? Nope, I have not had any of those symptoms post-surgery. I am glad to hear that it is not only me who has those stiches itching though! itching == wound healing == re-innervating == good! Normal to feel some itching, and a bit of warmth around the area. I always got freaked out when I would experience those symptoms, but after the 3rd surgery I realized they are just part of the healing process.", "Coping with the unknown Hi there, long time lurker here. I have congenital hydrocephalus, had a shunt for years which was bypassed. According to the neurosurgeons, I am \"cured\" as far as their expertise extends. However, in the last year, I have started looking around, and it seems that there are a lot of neurological difficulties associated with the condition (mostly to do with balance and spatial perception), that either the doctors did not know about when I was younger, or did not tell my parents about. I have had a load of issues recently, that are only slowly being sorted out, but because of the fact that the medical system is so badly joined up in this country (Ireland), I am wondering how if I will ever really know what is going on with me.\n\n How long have you had hydroephalus, what is the cause, and what kind of shunt/how long have you had one?  Since birth, it is congenital, and I had an Endoscopic third ventriculostomy when I was 16. I am 23 now, so that is been 7 years complication free. Before that I had a shunt, just ye old regular. \n\n Okay my knowledge of that kind of hydrocephalus is pretty minimal. The surgery was what I was hoping to get, but the area my tumor sits is too dangerous. But yeah, from what I have heard, if something (tumor) is blocking the ventricle from draining, removing the tumor is a solid cure", "Throbbing Pain in Shunt Site I had my VP Shunt Surgery this April and everything was fine up till now. Since the past few days however I have this throbbing Pain around the shunt site on my head which comes and goes. Is this something normal with VP Shunt patients?

I do not know if anyone is ever in this sub anymore, but maybe someone will see this. \n\nMy daughter was born with a grade III IVH (intraventricular hemorrhage) and has a VP shunt. We had some complications early on because it got infected and they had to externalize it for a couple of weeks, but she has done great other than that. My wife and I have been extremely fortunate because our little girl has grown and developed normally. She is the sweetest thing on earth and full of life.\n\nHowever, she is going in for a major revision next month because the current shunt is starting to become clogged and she needs a longer catheter. We are very nervous about this because our daughter has done amazingly for the last couple of years and has developed into a loving, little princess that is just exploding with personality.  \n\nI was hoping that someone in here might be able to help me. Is there any risk that these surgeries could alter personality or anything like that? Also, what in the world can I do for this little girl to make the surgery and the next few months easier for her. \n\nAny help, suggestions, or ideas would be very much appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n", "Redditors with Hydrocephalus, how \nlong since your last revision, how did it \ngo? Any other experience you would like to \nshare? I would like to set up a support forum here for other redditors with hydrocephalus. I recently realized that despite being shunted at birth, I have only met two other people with hydrocephalus and do not really keep in touch with them.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this forum is to help each other answer a few basic questions:\n-How is life with a shunt for other people out there?\n-How long are shunts lasting these days?\n-Do you have a hospital/doctor you would recommend for when the time comes?\n-How much are the surgeries costing (with and without insurance) these days?\n-Any experiences or other things you would like to share?\n\n\n\nAlso, I would love to see an offshoot that offers support to new parents of babies with hydrocephalus. I know it would have been a huge help to my parents at the time. New parents feel free to PM me with any questions you might have about what it is like to grow up with/be an adult with hydrocephalus.", "How to cope all of this? I guess most people are scared if they need to have a surgery, and of course they are scared even more when they need to have brain surgery.\n\nWhen they have gone thru the surgery and the surgery itself went ok they will be very delighted, and look forward to a good future being glad that everything went well.\n\nBut with vp shunt surgeries,  even when the surgery itself went ok, you never can be really sure that things are now ok, you know that you will probably need to have more brain surgeries. \n\nHow do you cope with this? I have had a VP shunt since I was 3 months old with zero revisions and now that I am older my health anxiety has gone through the roof. It does not help I have never been through the surgery that I remember, and I am almost 17 so I feel like any day now it could malfunction or brake. \n\nI honestly do not have any tips. For me, coming to terms with possibly dying young has helped. I have convinced my mom to start life insurance for me which also helped ease my mind for some reason. Just take it day by day, friend. It might also be worth trying to find a therapist that deals with hydro, I have not been able to find one around me but you might.\n\nSide note: I kind of think of it as if I am going to give birth. It is coming, idk when but it is definitely coming. I cannot stop it, and I do not know things will be okay during/after. I just have to deal with it when the time comes I am a parent, but went through a lot of ups, and downs with the health of my family before and after she was born. I learned to ride the wave when things are good. Try and enjoy the moment and not think to far on the future. Without getting too bleak, bad things beyond a shunt surgery are going to happen to all of us. It is an inevitability in life that puts the good times in perspective. Being able to enjoy the good times is critical to finding happiness in a world that also has hard times in it. I am more worried about the medical bills associated with these surgeries.  I got blown away with a 9k bill a few years ago and that is with health insurance.  I do not think I can survive another one financially. For me personally, I just take every day as it comes and live in the moment. Having a shunt since shortly after birth and having 30 revisions, I have come to terms that this is something that I will have to deal with for the rest of my life. It is the reason that I am still working on my Bachelors degree, yet I am still perusing that goal. I do not stress over the shunt and if it is failing until I actually begin showing my one and only symptom of shunt failure, which is a headache. My stress level and anxiety skyrocket until I make the decision to tell my parents that my shunt is failing and that I need to go to the hospital. Once I make that decision, it is like my stress and anxiety just melts away because I know what my immediate future entails. I know it is still going to suck; however, I am at peace with that and the possibility of having to have shunt surgery. Day at a time.  You may have ptsd, I sure do, therapy has been very comforting.  \n\nAlso you are alive. Make use of your minutes/hours/years and try not to dwell on What If\u2019s. Hi, I am kind of curious why you say you are at risk of dying young? Hydrocephalus is only lethal if it is untreated, and you were treated. It is actually extremely rare that this is what does you in Well I have been told by my neurologist that even an hour of the shunt malfunctioning can cause permanent brain damage, and it is brain surgery after all so you very well could die. The anesthesia can do you in, a hemorrhage during surgery can happen and I personally have a lot of scar tissue around the catheter/shunt so that also could cause issues. You can die during any surgery, now add the stress of possible compression of the brain+scar tissue they will have to cut out+brain surgery in general. And that is not even mentioning all the complications after surgery that can lead to death. I personally moved about 8 years ago from my home town and these doctors here are not great at all, my neurologist got suspended a couple months ago because she missed signs of a failed shunt that led to a 12 year old child\u2019s death. There is only 1 neurologist around me and all the doctors at all the hospitals here come from the same university, meaning they are all taught the same exact thing making it harder for another doctor to catch things one has possibly missed. \n\nYou can die during/after any surgery, even one as routine as tonsil removal. Yes of course, theres always that risk. Are you getting routine check ups?\n\nI just do not think its a good idea to just expect yourself to die young. There are people in this sub with 20+ shunt revisions. Yes any surgery can be lethal, but its just not a good way to go through life. Especially when you have not had complications in 15+ years Yes I get routine checkups, and I never said I expect myself to die early I said I have come to terms with it being a possibility. Shunts do not last forever so it is coming at some point. Personally coming to terms with that is better than thinking I am forever going to have to have multiple brain surgeries that can leave me a vegetable. Anybody going into any surgery should come to terms with death as a possibility Not to mention death is inevitable you should be fine with it. Why is it matter what age it comes, you cannot stop it and your forever going to have regrets about your life no matter the age. Seems stupid to not think of it as a very real possibility My neurologist told me that people with hydrocephalus are more prone to strokes so she said that at all times i should avoid any type of stress - easier said than done these days but my parents did best they could to keep me chilled and i do nowdays too and so far i had just one revision in 27 years and one tubing extension (just in case, no issues), so do best you can to stay calm and maybe seek some therapy sessions I never understood the extensions I got my tube and shunt as a 1 year old and I am 6'4/193 cm without and got told I could grow to 219 cm without the need for extensions. How tall where you when you got your tube extended? 170cm, it depends how long tube they installed and quite frankly if doctor wouldnt randomly suggest xray i wouldnt be able to tell that my tube is on the height of my lungs as i couldnt feel anything unusual Strange that they do not give everyone taller tubes mine would be usable by jaws in James Bond and I got it as a 1 year old. &gt;people with hydrocephalus are more prone to strokes\n\nI never knew this. Thanks for this my doctor was quite oldschool so i would take it with pinch of salt but that is exactly what she told me, she was also very much against CT scans without need as used to say that may also trigger hydrocephalus Okay, understandable. I will remember that", "Has a neuro ever told u this? In 2020 I had an ultrasound for a mysterious lump on my shunt valve and the ultrasound had concluded that the shunt had migrated and is not in my stomach anymore (due to growth) - note I have only had 1 revision at 6months (both VP). My mum asked how the fluid is draining then if the shunt system is not in my stomach (it is in my xiphisternum) and the neuro said that the tissue grew around it and formed an \u2018artificial pathway\u2019. If that happened, why do people get the tubing lengthened? Did that process happen since my shunt has been in me and unchanged for so long (I am 17 now)? I have been told that can happen. In layman's terms (not a doctor), I think the body can \"calcify\" around the tubing so if it breaks or moves away, the pathway will still act as a tubing of sorts.\n\nMy doc suspects that my tubing may have broken but the body adjusted to it like that. It does not drain into your stomach.  There is a membrane ( that lines the abdominal cavity and the fluid drains and absorbs into it **( \n \n &gt;The peritoneum is the serous membrane forming the lining of the abdominal cavity or coelom in amniotes and some invertebrates, such as annelids. It covers most of the intra-abdominal (or coelomic) organs, and is composed of a layer of mesothelium supported by a thin layer of connective tissue. This peritoneal lining of the cavity supports many of the abdominal organs and serves as a conduit for their blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. The abdominal cavity (the space bounded by the vertebrae, abdominal muscles, diaphragm, and pelvic floor) is different from the intraperitoneal space (located within the abdominal cavity but wrapped in peritoneum).\n \n^(( | )( | )( | )( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5) I was actually just told this earlier this week.

I have been having headaches, and urinary problems, blurred vision and mood swings and drowsy loss of interest in activities the only recourse is to have a shunt placed in my head for people who have had this surgery has it worked has it given you back a quality of life I am kind of sceptical because I have lost a job over this  condition. I have been having more days off work due to my headaches and the blurred vision people think that I am faking but I really do have problems I just hope I do not loose this job. Talk to your neurologist/neurosurgeon. If they think you need a shunt, then you need it. But just glancing at your post history a lot of this could potentially be related to stress/anxiety/depression. Just make sure you rule out the stuff that does not require surgery first. If it is 100% attributed to hydrocephalus then yes a shunt will absolutely help. It will not affect your life too much either. I still skate, surf, rock climb, etc. But I definitely cannot do those things like I used to. Cannot be getting hit in the head. I asked my daughters neurologist about breaking shunts during play. He said he had only seen two broken shunts due to impact. Both he said were such hard hits that had the person not fallen on the shunt they likely would have fractured their skulls. Jesus really? I have never really asked about how hard is too hard. That sounds pretty damn hard If it is not standard practice, ask for a lumbar puncture to see if less CSF eases the symptoms. This will give you confidence the surgery is the right move. I have had the lumbar puncture done before like 3 time it did help but it is happening more often then before  so I am going to see a neurologist and go from there I hope they can just have me come back every so often and remove the fluid without the surgery. A lady that I work with sister has to get it done like every 6 months or so Relief from a LP is a pretty obvious indication that you need surgical treatment. Good luck! Can confirm. Hit my head hard enough on the reservoir to break my shunt and push brain matter into the end. Never been so concussed in my life and the concussion symptoms lasted months. Later I learned to duck my head in a way where the shunt was not the highest point on my head hahaha. Jeebus. My 2 year old daughter has a shunt.

Hi Folks,\n\nI am a 30yo male with congenital hydrocephalus. I am 17 revisions deep, with 5 just in the last year. I always had Medtronic valves, including one that lasted me 22 years. Tons of scar tissue and changing pressure needs have been an issue. Recently met with a new doctor who is a big proponent of Aesculap programmable valves \\(which apparently have a re\\-calibrating anti\\-siphon device that can be adjusted independently from the main valve as well.\\) \n\nAs a lot of you might experience, typically when a valve fails after a long time, it seems to take 2\\-3 revisions to get things working stably again. I have been hearing that with the Aesculap adjustable could help me to reduce or eliminate the need for repeated revisions in the same year since every component is programmable. The titanium construction would also be resistant to compression from scar tissue which may have caused my initial failure last year. Seems like a great idea but I wonder about the downside of not having a reservoir that can be tapped to relieve pressure if I am waiting hours for the surgery.\n\nDoes any have experience with Aesculap valves? In practice, do you feel you have been able to avoid repeat revisions due to its reprogrammability? Any other pros, cons or things to get used to? \n\nAre they comfortable to wear? I had an OSV II valve for about 3 weeks before it failed and it was uncomfortable as shit due to its hard plastic construction. Aesculap valves seem more contoured but cannot tell from diagrams.\n\n I am particularly interested in hearing from adult patients born with the condition since I know we are kind of a unique case, but would welcome all responses. Also would be really like to hear from anyone switching over from Medtronic Delta or PS valves to Aesculap.\n\nThanks so much and best of health to all! Anyone...? Anyone...? Bueller? Bueller? This sub can be like that :) I have no idea of the name/model of mine - the last one was installed in 1990. I had an MRI last year and needed to find out, but the children's hospital had destroyed my records - I guess I will never know ! Thanks for responding :)\n\nYeah, I am in Europe for school and having trouble finding a good backup just in case... Ah well I have know someone who is gotten the Aesculap adjustable anti-siphon being added to a (Codman) shunt system. \n\nThe ProSa Aesculap valve &amp; anti-siphon combo, which it sounds like you are looking at, does seem to have a reservoir, despite the misleading advertised photo:  (pg. 6)\n\nI have never considered the comfort of brands, interesting, makes sense. But do you think your OSV II was merely sore from surgery? \n\nWill this be your first programmable valve? There are neurosurgeons on both sides of the fence about A. brains adjusting to a shunt regardless of pressure; and B. programmable allowing fine-tuning to happy CSF pressure. The former seems to be old school thinking, and I agree with the latter (12 revision exp. points). However, having a programmable comes with issues. \n\n-Make sure you have a magnetic resistance up to 3T (T=Tesla). This allows it to not be reprogrammed in *most* MRI's in hospitals (there are stronger, newer MRI's up to 5T, but those are mostly for research). To have your shunt reset and X-ray to check, and radiologist reading of the X-ray upside down and subsequent hell, is not worth the trouble. Get 3T. The Aesculap is verified up to 3T. \n\n- Pressure adjustments are not always a solution to avoiding revision. If it fails, it fails. \n\n- Pressure adjustments can put your brain out of whack for several weeks while you adjust, sometimes painful &amp; you are out of commission cannot lay down to sleep, sometimes just subtle disorientation until it rebalances. This can start a wild goose chase of finding the Goldilocks setting over 6 months +, when there is just something wrong with the shunt and the expedient choice would be revision. Having an adjustable shunt AND an adjustable anti-siphon *sounds* good, but there is so many variables that it is not worth the visits for adjustment or the additional components to break. (Unless we had personal programmers!)\n\n-Sometimes the adjustor sets your pressure to the wrong setting and you jump 200mL of CSF instead of 100, and it will hurt. Codman has one with a bunch of smaller settings so this will be less likely, but more doctor appointments to build up a pressure. \n\nThat being said, reprogrammable is the way to go, IMO. Anti-siphon is a given if you have ever had over-drainage symptoms, or are tall. \n\nSource: 29F; 12 revisions in 20 years; Codman, Medtronic, various Sophysa models for 10+ years; and ran a hydro support group. \n\nFeel free to shoot me any more questions, I commiserate with your situation!!

In 2019, she had a reservoir fitted,\n\nJust recently she is had headaches in the morning - two consecutive days a week, so we are off for an MRI earlier than she would have been scheduled for (annual check was due in September).\n\nCan ETVs fail twice? Does this mean she will get a shunt placed now? \n\nAnd also, can you tell if a headache is migranous or hydrocephalus-induced? \n\nThanks Hi, my 17 yr old had an ETV 6 weeks ago. She was told that if it failed they would do a shunt. I am guessing you are going to see a Neurosurgeon soon about next steps? Keep safe and message if you need to chat. Be great to think about getting the kids on this sub  to have a chat? Not sure how, but might be good for our young people to connect with their peers and support each other too. I was reshunted two months after my ETV because the pain never went away. My MRI looked good but the pain said otherwise.  I am now 10 years in with the programmable shunt with no issues. It is difficult to explain a hydro headache to those who do not experience them. All I can say is it is different. The only way I can explain it is your head is in a vice. Thanks, phone appt with neurosurgeon on the 4/6 to discuss MRI which is on 31/5. Thanks, very interesting and good to hear you are better. That is good. It is a good idea to record that so you can relisten to it afterwards if you need to. I have been writing notes when my daughter's specialists call, but figured much easier do this. I had an ETV as a first treatment as a 30 year old for obstructive hydrocephalus and it has stayed open for the least 2 years so might be an option later in life, as opposed to constant shunt revisions. I am told that they can heal over for children and young adults but less so for adults. Her symptoms sound like mine I have had one ETV and feel it is failing I wake with pain in my head and jaw and it hangs around all day, pills do not really help. I have had this for a few weeks as well. \nI hope she gets the help she needs and feels\nBetter soon Thanks - you too.  She has had another MRI on Monday but the Drs havent read it yet! so we are taking her somewhere else. I dont know about where you live, but I always ask for copies of my MRIs and tests to keep for future comparison, I never know what doctor I will end up with. You would think any thing brain related would be checked as soon as the scan is done, but sadly it does not happen. I had a scan a week ago and am not expecting to hear for a month when I have my check up. \nIt is a good  idea to see anger doctor, hopefully they do not have to rescan and can get the other mri results to save you all time \nAll the best I hope you get a good doctor and she feel better soon ", "Can my VP shunt malfunction without fever/ vomiting/headache? I have had a lot of pain around my scars, have not been drinking a lot of water etc. Pain dulls a bit when I drink water but comes right back. I have had this shunt since I was 2 weeks old and am 26 The odds of an infection are pretty low. They decrease more and more over time as you move away from your surgery. Essentially, infections stem from being opened up and exposed to the outside world since your skin plays a huge role in your immune system. Symptoms seem to vary from person to person too so I would not focus on what you do not exhibit but the issues you are actually experiencing. I would get it checked out and get In touch with your neurologist. Better to do it now as a precaution than later as a potential emergency. I do not actually have a neurologist because I have not been seen since I was 19. Do I need a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. I always get confused You need a neurosurgeon I have tried getting one through insurance but they say they need an mri and their scheduling team never calls me back. I feel guilty about this but I am thinking about going to the ER as a non-emergency patient to get an mri done and see a neurosurgeon I do not know how it goes when you have to go through insurance, I was referred to a NS and I am Canadian so it might be different \n\nBut if you think you are having a prob you can def go to the ER do not feel bad about it Can you adopt someone from the USA? Asking for a friend \ud83d\ude05 I would call your insurance company. You should not need a new diagnosis or an mri to prove anything, though your Neurosurgeon will probably want to have a scan to look at. I would just call to explain your situation to the provider. My family has had to do this a lot due to a variety of issues and circumstances. They say that it is been too long since my last imaging (which is ct)...plus I have no idea who has my records as the doctor who was my provider left that practice... That is frustrating. I would call the ok\u2019d practice and see what they have. You may be able to schedule with a different doctor through them. Their billing department may also be able to help you with getting insurance to actually do something. Those people will be able to commiserate with you on the difficulty of handling insurance issues. The old practice is pediatrics. Forgot to mention Yes. You can have a malfunction without the typical symptoms. I have had that happen a few times. \n\nFrom reading your other responses, you are in the US and you do not have a NS. That is not uncommon when it is been so long since you have needed surgery and you are now an adult. Most NS's here will not look at you if it is been longer than 2 years without issues unless you have an MRI or CT that shows something wrong. Go to your PCP and tell them what is wrong, they should be able to get you a CT or MRI and a referral to a NS. So I do not actually know the answer to your main question, but I wanted to share my experience. I had my shunt placed in 2001 and I had not been for a follow up in like 10 years, during which I became a legal adult. \n\nI Found a neurologist first, and had them request all of my records from every hospital and office that was involved in my medical history first. \n\nThen they were able to find the manufacturer info regarding my shunt to make sure it would not interfere with any imaging machine I would use. \n\nOnce we were able to get that information we were finally able to get me in a machine. Took a few months so you may want to start as soon as possible. You mean neurosurgeon right? I actually started with finding a neurologist which I realize now was unorthodox. I was not aware that neurosurgeons typically managed them. I was like 5 when mine was placed. \n\nFortunately the neuro I found was awesome and had a staff that were able to consolidate all my records. Hi  If the pain comes back, I would recommend going to your doctor.  I just had a shunt failure/replacement at age fifty-three.  Like any other device, things do wear out.  The technology has changed a lot.  Best wishes. For your shunt, you need a neurosurgeon.  Neurologists treat issues with the electrical activity in the brain/nervous system.  I have a neurologist for treatment of my epilepsy &amp; a neurosurgeon for my shunt. Its still here so I am thinking of going to urgent care and have them refer me to hospital for imaging    I agree.  They can order a CT scan.  If something is wrong, you will immediately be referred to a neurosurgeon.  Best of luck.    I agree.  I did that with my last malfunction a couple of months ago.  It is great if you can get the name of a dr. from your GP or neurologist.  \n\n   I did have a strange experience yrs. ago w/ a neurosurgeon referred by my retiring NS. When I made an appt., the dr. asked why I was there if nothing was wrong.

I have had a shunt since I was 6 months, my neurosurgeon is confident in saying I should not go skydiving. I think we are SOL buddy Just from a quick google I have found accounts of people safely sky diving and scuba diving (scuba diving with a vp shunt). I think it is safe to say it depends on what type of hydrocephalus a person has and is only going to be safe on a person to person basis. Thanks, guess I will have to consult with my NS, I have always been a thrill seeker type so this whole thing is kind of a shock to me, going to have to get into the habit of googling if I can do stuff first It is definitely going to be a doctor question. I would suggest making a list before contacting them so you can get answers on a variety of queries. I have always had good luck getting fast answers if I contact ours through the MyChart app. My daughters neurosurgeon honestly said she should not have any limitations beyond being inverted for extended times. He even suggested that there are rumors of an nfl player with a shunt. Google tells me it is George Visger- or at least he is one player with one. He is an older player (drafted 1980). \n\nI never knew this! I am a skydiving coach and have a VP shunt placed at birth for hydrocephalus. I have never had an issue with it.\n\nI was born with a sub-arachnoid cyst that causes a build up of CSF. The shunt regulates the pressure in my head by draining into my abdomen; I am not sure what other kinds of shunts there are. \n\nI have done over 400 jumps since 2014 and have not had any issues with pressure changes while jumping. This was also a bucket list item for me. My parents told me I could do it as long as my NS said it was OK (thinking he would say no). I asked him at one of my followup appointments about it and he said YES!! It shocked my parents but they held up their end and allowed me to go. Hands down best experience I have ever had.  I have gone twice and would love to go again. Sadly I will never be able to train and jump by myself due to my epilepsy.  But it is well worth the money and any time someone wants to go, I am right there with them. I am hoping one day to take some friends and family to jump with me. Awesome, thanks for this I hope you go through with it! Skydiving changes perspective for people. For me, it was life changing!! This gives me hope, thank you Oh I will, my reputation for doing stuff precedes me I have had a VP shunt since I was 2 months old. I currently have a programmable shunt. I have been sky diving and scuba diving (only down to 20 feet though) with my neurosurgeon's blessing. Definitely check with your NS before going, but as long as they say it is ok, go for it!

I know it is not exactly what you have but I do understand My 2 year old has had hydrocephalus since birth and vision problems.  His eyes cross and his depth perception is pretty bad.  He had 1 surgery last year to try and fix it and another scheduled for August. My 2 year old has hydrocephalus and has crossed eyes. He has had 2 strabismus surgeries and his eyes now look much better. He does not have 3D vision which I believe causes depth perception. We will find out more as he gets older. My brotha!

The way we learned I had hydrocephalus is that I could no longer see clearly from my right eye, i was nine years old, am 38 years old now.  My mom had our eyes checked on a regular basis but the optician at that time, 1989, suggested I come in every two years instead of the recommended once a year visit.  We lived in a small town of 5000 people and were located five hours from the nearest eye specialist.  Mom never forgave herself for listening to the optician,  because it is possible my eyes could have have been checked sooner and my condition diagnosed faster to prevent pressure in my head that caused the optic nerve which semi detached from the retina.  \n\nGood news is I had no trouble getting a drivers license,  I even ride a motorcycle, and in general my partial blindness has had very little negative impact on my life.

No matter what, if your child has to have revisions, chances are, regardless of if you choose surgery or eye therapy, you will end up back at square one after that. At that point, if you have had surgery, it can be harder to get the depth perception back.\n\nI had 0 depth perception, did eye therapy for a year, and gradually developed depth perception for most of my field of vision. I then had to have surgery, and after, I had most of my depth perception still. After that, I had bacterial meningitis, and it all went out the window. I have been doing some of the exercises again, and I have gained about a small patch of depth about a foot from my face. I am making progress faster than I did at first, too.\n\nSome eye therapy places seem like quacks, and at first, mine did, but then I let it go and threw myself into exercises. I was 16, so it was not like my eyes' behavior was all that flexible, and for the first time, I saw depth.\n\nIt is worth looking into. It is hard to do therapy with a two-year-old. ..

I had not been diagnosed with hydrocephalus yet. Im 28 and was diagnosed this year. Well, surgery did not work. It actually made things worse and my eye surgeon sent me to a more specialized surgeon to fix what he thought was his mistake.

He said a ligation was easier than a revision for my symptoms which could have been a shunt malfunction, but also my hydrocephalus could have been temporary. Now his only tool is a lumbar puncture which was actually painful last time and becoming a small torture to endure. My LPs have borderline high opening rates due to where my tumor+cyst was that lead to hydrocephalus, but he does not believe me or take into consideration the research my previous neurosurgeon (who recently retired) did which confirms pineal cyst/tumor patients experience hydrocephalus at slightly lower rates than most people. I fear if I have another borderline opening pressure he will not do anything and I will slowly decline, and be stuck with complications from the ligation. Why could not he have done other tests before ligating? Maybe I should have pushed harder?

My father used to be super sharp, full of joy, etc and now it is like talking to a 10 year old a lot of times.  I love him either way but want to make sure I am doing whatever I can do help him get through this.  \n\nIf anyone has some good links, etc on the top doctors in the field for adults with hydro I would really appreciate it.  I spent a few hours googling it but did not find a lot.", "Anyone Have Their Shunt Removed? Curious to know if anyone has had their shunt removed because it was no longer needed. If so, how was that determined and how did it work out? Mine is not out *yet* but here is what I was told. When I was about 3ish my shunt stopped working and it was determined I no longer needed it as my ICP remained normal (I had obstructive hydrocephalus) at every checkup until I was 12. I was then told I could safely have a surgery to remove it and that it would probably be a quick outpatient-type procedure. \n\nI decided against it because I felt it was more trouble than it was worth since my shunt is not causing me problems other than occasional tightness. It will probably be removed when I have my spinal fusion for my (unrelated) scoliosis.\n\nHope I helped! I had mine removed in 2015. To determine if I still needed it they did a quick image mri with some sort of contrast that they injected directly into my shunt. This was to check if there was any flow. \nThey determined that I did not need it and then took it out a couple weeks later. \n\nAbout a month passed and it turns out I really needed it! They had to put a new one in. I just had a very slow leak. \n\nHope this helps! That is what I would be afraid of. Sorry to hear. That sucks. Thanks for response. Yes. Thanks! Got mine removed 8/2018. They left the portion from my skull into the ventricles because of the calcification and just capped the hole so we did not risk a brain bleed. We had known that it had been disconnected in the neck for about 2 years with zero symptoms. I spent one night in the ICU so they could do this weird photo thing to my eyes every hour. Then next morning a CT. And I was out. \n\nEverything healed up nicely and life is good. Still have a calcium cast in my neck from the shunt (I had it placed before they coated the outside with something that i do not remember the name of). Shunted at 10mo following removal of a brain tumour - the assumption was the hydrocephalus would sort itself out, so when I grew up with no apparent issues, they assumed it was dormant. When I started my teenage growth spurts I started getting a lot of discomfort along the tubing and headaches so they decided to remove all of it except the bits in my skull - as another poster has said, because calcification.\n\nI was nearly 17 when they did it. They discharged me the next day as they put my nausea and headaches down to a bad reaction to the general anaesthetic. 2 days later I was rushed back in to have the shunt reinstated!\n\nHad to have three more ops after that to fix consequent issues, then a revision (another three ops) four years later. See my post history for more details!\n\nTl;dr - Yes. It did not end well. Was your neurosurgeon able to pull the lower portion of your shunt out in one piece? I ask because my neurosurgeon has suggested taking my shunt out as mine is disconnected in my neck, causing discomfort, etc. He told me he might have to make an incision from my neck down to my abdomen to get it out and that has been my only fear! \nI have not known too many people with a similar situation to mine so any insight is appreciated. I am also curious about what a calcium cast is! No! it is only out from outer skull to about my nipple height in my chest. It was basically breaking into 1 inch pieces and he did not want to filet me. It is so locked in with calcium that it is not that noticeable. A calcium cast is just the covering of calcium that is still sticking to whatever is in my neck. I had to have my shunt removed in 2016, because I went septic (unrelated to the shunt) and they did not want the infection mainlining to the brain. They did not put it back in right away for various reasons, and then I was seeming to do fine without it. \n\nCut to me now, laying in bed with an ice pack strapped to my head, in horrible pain. I have had a constant Pressure headache for the past two weeks (that started after an afternoon long sneeze attack) that will not go away. And today I started having that telltale pressure behind my eyes. \n\nWho wants to guess if I need my shunt put back? Ima take a wild guess and say I do... ;) Damn. I am sorry. Wife is likely getting catheter tied off to see what happens. Of course, we are praying for the miracle of her for some reason no longer needing it but I am not hopeful. This has been a nightmare for years. Oof. I am hoping for her sake that she does just fine without it!! I do know that this is the case for some people- maybe she is one of my lucky ones :) Keep UA posted! Good luck! And just remember, if the day is sucky, remember this:  I was 10 when my shunt broke. Luckily after a couple weeks of bad headaches and vomiting, I guess my body started doing what it was supposed to. They left my shunt in, because they thought it would be more trouble talking it out. I have not had any problems since. I am 34 now. You can still feel where it broke.", "What areas of the brain does hydro damage?

(Which would be affected by hydro as hydro affects both sides)", "Surgery was Tuesday, still healing, I can still feel it, tell me it does not stay like this I feel like I am going crazy, I do not think I am going to be able to keep this thing in there, any advice is appreciated", "The placement of one of my shunts drives me nuts. I have got 3 shunts (two that were inserted as an infant, and one inserted in 2003). The newest one is placed in such a way that whether I lay on my back or my right side, the entire weight of my head presses onto the shunt reservoir. The only way to lay without putting weight on the shunt is to lay on my left side which is not comfortable either.  I have tried building my pillows up around they shunt, but that has not helped much. Does anyone else have this problem? 3 shunts?! Damn I thought I was special with 2. I had problems like that for a few months after my 2nd one (installed last May), but eventually it came became more comfortable. I know you said you tried building your pillows up, but maybe try buying a pillow of a different thickness? Since my surgery last year, I basically cannot sleep unless i have a large, bulky, memory foam pillow like ( The way it molds to my head puts less pressure on the shunt itself. I was never a big, bulky pillow kind of guy until last year. Now it is all I can use.  Yeah, I had 3 operations by the time I was 18mo. Apparently I have got multiple pockets of fluid in different areas of the brain, one doc called 'multi-cystic hydrocephalus'. First shunt was put in @ 6wks, but was apparently not draining enough fluid so a second shunt was put in at 6mo. When i got chickenpox at 18mo. the 2nd shunt clogged and needed a revision. After that, things were 'normal' until I was 22 and had 4 or 5 absolutely brutal headache attacks in the span of about 2 months. After 3 weeks in hospital, a new shunt was installed. The first two have never been removed due to doctors not wanting to mess with old scar tissue.\n\nI have tried a bunch of pillows in the last few years and it is been uncomfortable with all of them. Crazy. My first was put in at 5 months old. Same story as you, when I got my second one (after 10 years of being \"normal\") they did not want to remove my old, calcified shunt. I know the struggle, man, it is tough as shit. I have actually never fully recovered to the point I was at before last May. I have gotten 2 shunt adjustments in the last 20 days because I have had persistent headaches/dizziness/visual problems. More intense than usual. \n\nWhat does your doc say about sleeping comfortably? He or she might have some insight. Sometimes when my headaches get really bad I sleep kind of propped up, almost sitting but not quite, that way it is not as much downward force.  Mine is not a programmable, so 'adjustments' are not a possibility. I have been lucky that my current pain management plan has kept me out of the ER for about 3 years now, but it is still far from an ideal situation.  I have not seen a neurosurgeon in about 5 years because they said that unless something critical happens, to just continue managing pain as they were understandably leery of any more surgeries than necessary. The surgeon that did my last operation moved away about 5 years ago and his replacement gave me a shitty attitude in our only meeting. I tried sleeping like that for a while, but it began hurting my back. Mine is not a programmable, so 'adjustments' are not a possibility.

I have a big soft stuffed animal that I use to kind of make a nest around my head.  Like a big fluffy neck pillow. I got it at a children's hospital gift shop when I was admitted for surgery and have used it for over 15 years.  \n\nWhen I do not have my stuffed animal with me, I put two pillows in a v shape and one draped across the top to creat the same effect. It supports my head, but still gives enough to not put too much pressure on it.  I have 3 in but they removed the reservoirs in my other ones, just left the catheters into the ventricles. So I do not have this issue. However, when I have a healing piercing I use a travel pillow to lift my ear off the bed. Maybe this could work for you?

Tonight, we have noticed that the spot on his head where the reservoir is seems to be sticking out more than usual. We have also come to realize he is been sleeping a lot more than usual these past few weeks. Does it sound like somethings wrong? What should we do? Thanks for any advice.  Perhaps go see his neurosurgeon?  Does he have any other symptoms i.e. Migraines, vomiting, loss of appetite, and aversion to light. Also is he noticeably harder to keep awake during the day. If he is having multiple of those symptoms it might be a good idea to go to an E.R. \n\nBest of Luck I definitely recommend contacting his neurosurgeon. You can even call them and leave a message for their nurse or talk to them, if possible. You could be like \u201chello, I was calling because I have a concern about one of your patients.\u201d Then go on to explain you concerns. You could follow it up with \u201cdo you think he needs to be seen?\u201d They would be able to help out more. It is better to be safe than sorry. Call his NS.  It could be just an increase in CSF flow due to a pressure change, but it could also signify something more serious.  The NS should be able to help figure out the cause. My rule of thumb is, if I think there could be a problem call the doctor or go straight to the ER.  He has a lingering headache that is been around for a little while now, and ever since the brain surgery he just does not eat much. He says he gets nauseous, but he feels the nausea in his head if that makes sense? I am still struggling to understand what all these symptoms mean. But we are headed to the ER in just a little while.  wishing you all well  When was the surgery? It took time for the skin on my daughter head to re attach to her skull. But if I was him, rather safe than sorry I dont have a shunt (my son does) but I get nausea in my head sometimes too...

When were you diagnosed? I m new here so forgive me. Years I have felt a pressure in my head, mostly in the front top, down to my temples. Its always felt like fluid even tho I do not exactly know what that actually feels like. I could be wrong. Some days are better than others, but recently I have been getting more and more headaches. Obviously, I have not been diagnosed so I am sorry if I am out of place here, I am not trying to self diagnose. I am just trying to understand. Many of the sysmptoms check out as well, except for lack of coordination problems with vision. I am just wondering if this is worth getting checked out by the doctor. Just go to the eye doctor they can tell you about the pressure on your brain and if needed send you to get a MRI. That is how I got diagnosed       \nI did not really have any symptoms leading up to the diagnosis that I was aware of. (But I was also 15 year olds so maybe I just did not know the signs) The eye doctor? How could they tell? I have not been in years so it is probably time anyways Diagnosed in May but mine was resulting from a brain tumour. The tumour was obstructing the flow of the fluid so I often had pain right on top of my head and various head rushes where it felt like the fluid had rushed from neck to front of head. Headaches got increasingly worse often loosing weekends to migraines. Getting eyes checked is good idea as you may be squinting or straining without noticing. I had mine since birth. I started drinking more water to keep myself in check.

I was recently told that I would need to externalize my shunt tubing to check for infection, and was wondering if anyone had experience with this? I was just wondering whether it hurt or not. \nThank you in advance! It does not hurt, but it can extremely uncomfortable. You need to keep your head at a certain height/angle which can irritate your neck/shoulders etc. Thank you for your response! Were you awake when they did it or was it under anesthesia? You go under to disconnect the shunt and redirect it to an IV like bag. Make sure you understand the operation fully, you will need a shunt revision to connect everything back together, which I am sure you know is not a fun recovery process. I had 3 different EVD\u2019s in the space of a month and boy was it an experience. They do not hurt, they are a little uncomfortable but you get used to it. What is really annoying is having to have it adjusted every time you change position to make sure it is draining properly. You may also get attached to the pole the drain is attached to like I did \ud83d\ude02 overall, not a terrible experience and I am sure you will be fine. Best of luck!! I went about five months with an externalized shunt! It does not hurt, and once you get used to it, sleeping is not bad. I slept very rigid my first few nights. Once I got the hang of it, it was no big deal.\n\nShowering was not fun, ended up using plastic wrap and medical tape (I had the external tube out of the a chest and a pic line in the arm.\n\nYour arm will get tired if you are moving around a lot, so if you are going places, have some thing to attach it to (ended up using a coat rack for a while!)\n\nOh, and at least for me, I was blown away by how much spinal fluid I was cranking out.\n\nHere is to hoping you are ok, I had staphylococcus in spinal fluid, never made the blood, thankfully. Took them a few revisions to replace it all.\n\nHang in there! They externalized mine before deciding to give me 2 new programmable vp shunts. It did not hurt but as was mentioned, you have to be careful about your positioning etc For me, I did not have any pain with the experience. I had a shunt infection and I had the shunt externalized for a week while I was on strong antibiotics. I had a PICC line put in that they used to push the antibiotics through. Having to have someone adjust the level of the shunt every time I wanted to shift or change positions or get up was the only bother. Had this a lot while I was in hospital. Got an infection which meant the shunt had to be externalised ( also needed a appendectomy and laparotomy as my infection had spread where it drained ). \n\nAs others have said you just have to ensure you are right level with the drain etc but the nurses should be able to adjust and advise on that.", "Does anyone know if the flashlight test will show possible optical nerve damage from months ago?

Obviously it is a totally different device than an adjustable shunt but should I/we be concerned? I have an adjustable Certas Plus valve and an adjustable ProSA antisiphon device. Has anyone gotten information from your neurosurgeon or experienced any issues? I sent a message to my doctor at Johns Hopkins and waiting for a response. If something interferes with a pacemaker, it will usually interfere with a shunt. I am waiting for more research at the moment, but I certainly will not be using one for now, Not even someone else's. I got my phone before the possible inference was announced. I have been using my airpods or my left ear until I hear one way or the other. If the phones have a case on them the magnet is not even strong enough to attract a paperclip I have been using AirPods for a while now with no adverse effects. I only have the iPhone 11 though so I am not sure about the 12...post an update if and when you find out please lol If your shunt is the type with a locking programmable valve (like the Sophysa Polaris) you are probably fine but should definitely go off of your NS's recommendations. Personally, I have a sophysa polaris 400 and I build very powerful magnets for a living. I am allowed in areas that are not ok for pacemakers, but I do feel when there is a strong magnetic field near me even if it is safe (ie, will not change my setting).\n\nThe magnets in the iPhone 12 are NOT like the weak ones in a phone case, so you are definitely doing the right thing by checking with your neurosurgeon.\n\nTl;dr: Depends on your specific shunt whether or not it will be an issue.

Hello from the very cold Netherlands\n\nI had my shunt last revised in 1998, and never had any issues since.\n\nNow I have had a few weird things happen, and I would like to know if any of this sounds familiar.\n\nWhen I bow down to tie my shoes or anything, I get light headed and a throbbing kind of feeling.\n\nI get these episodes of the back of my head suddenly feeling icy cold. \n\nI have a weird kind of discomfort/pain behind and around my right ear, just under where my VP is located. I went to my GP, was diagnosed with a severe ear infection and am on drops now.\n\nI am not seeing a NS regularly, as he told me he only needed to see me if there are issues. I would at least go in to see your neurosurgeon, they can get an MRI and at least calm your fears if not discover a malfunction. I was thinking the same thing.. but that cannot be sceduled this year due to covid. The only way would be through the ER If you are worried enough about it, call your neurosurgeon/hospital and see what they think. They might make an exception for you if it is bad enough. Potential shunt malfunctions are emergencies, if you are genuinely concerned ( you know your normal) it is worth getting it checked.\nI have found I can get light headed with exercise and certain movements e.g. leaning but I have a cyst  growing  and on cusp anyway Hey from the very cold netherlands back! Sounds like its worth getting checked up on? GP\u2019s make mistakes unfortunately. Something similar happened to me when I was twelve, the GP thought it was an infection, he put me on antibiotics, a few weeks later it became an emergency and i was rushed into OR. While it could have been discovered earlier if my gp had been more carefull. Maybe try getting in contact with your NS and have a chat? I really hope for you it is nothing serious. I also have the light-headed/throbbing head if I bend down, and my shunt is functioning (overdraining - functioning too well!). I do not have an answer unfortunately - I figure that I am just sensitive to gravity and cannot deal with my head being upside down. So I kneel/crouch to tie my shoes instead of bending over. I actually experience the other things you have mentioned too - I attributed that to scar tissue/nerve damage. \n\nUnfortunately I cannot tell you whether your shunt is or is not working...and I appreciate that with COVID it is difficult to get medical advice if it is not immediately life-threatening. It does sound like something it is worth talking to your surgeon about, especially if this is a relatively new change for you. I hope you get answers. Find a NS who plans to see you at least yearly. That is the preferred frequency. I had that feeling when my shunt was overdraining too. Good luck. I would at least call your neurosurgeon and tell them what is going on. There are ways of working around what is in place. I was in shunt failure and did not want to go through the emergency room, so my NS sent me to his office who then scheduled an MRI and based on that, directly admitted me to the hospital so that I would not have to go to the Emergency Room due to the risk of being exposed to COVID. My NS told me seeing me yearly is not nescessary. To just come in when there are issues.\nI need a referral from my GP to see him. Where I live going to the ER without referral is not even possible. Unless you had an accident, heart attack etc I will call him today. Hopefully I can talk to him directly, and not just his secretary I appreciate that your neurosurgeon has said he does not need to see you routinely, but this **is** an issue and you know it is not normal, hence you are posting here. The best advice my surgeon ever gave me was \u201c**you** know sooner than any doctor or any scan if something is wrong, because it is inside **your** head\u201d. Do not try to make excuses or justifications - it is your brain!! It is so important! Do not be taking chances. Best case scenario if you go in is that you waste someone is time just for peace of mind. It is not worth the risk! Get checked :) yeah, I get a lot of those symptoms a lot myself. I am 17 years post last operation. I usually get a tingling / pain around my left ear where my shunt runs by, like it is doing it right now actually. I do seem to get lightheaded doing weird things. Whenever it is cold my shunt gets cold and I get headaches a lot. Hey! Just wondering how it went for you and how are things now? Hey! So nice of you to ask!\n\nI did not get in to an appointment with my neurosurgeon. They told me straight away that I had to see a neurologist, they would make new x-rays, MRI's or CT's. If it then turned out to be an issue that needed surgical intervention, they would refer me to the neurosurgeon right away.\n\nAppointment made, but on a maaassive waiting list. \nIn the meantime I had a little temperature as well, so saw my GP. He immediately looked into my ear and saw a massive infection. \nEver since that was treated, all symptoms are gone.\n\n I am still on the list to see the neurologist, but not sure if I should now. Since a trip to the hospital would mean loads of people so lots of risk. I have a weak immune system, and my father in law has cancer. I am not taking any chances without symptoms", "piercings? ok hi this may be a bizarre question but i have not been able to contact my neurosurgeon in so long and i have been dying to know this for years but never remembered to ask\n\ni have had a VP shunt since 2 days old w only an elective tube lengthening, nothing done to the actual shunt. \n\ni have always wanted a belly button piercing but i am not sure if that is too risky? like? if it were to get infected or reject, would that put the shunt at risk because of how close my anchor is to my belly button? (like about 2 inches) or is it so surface level that it really would not react at all and even if it were to get infected it would not matter because they are so far apart as far as layers go. and that is not even saying that it would get infected, i am not really prone to piercings getting infected but i would never assume anything and i would rather be safe. \n\ni am exhausted so i apologize if this was worded weirdly i am just sick of not knowing if i am able to do things :/ I have a non-functioning but very much existent shunt and I have a bunch of ear piercings close to the top of the shunt and I have been fine! I think you should be completely fine, as it is all surface level and your shunt probably sits in your peritoneal cavity buried under epidermis, dermis, fat, more tissue, etc.\n\nThe only thing I noticed is that my daith makes the part of the shunt near my ear more noticeable in terms of sensation but that might be because it is sore so it feels tight. You will be fine having a belly button piercing. Go get your navel pierced and have fun! I do not have a navel piercing but have two holes in each ear. I got the top of my ear pierced for my wedding anniversary, but had to remove it 25 days later when I had a revision, and I have never had it re-done. Maybe someday though! You will be fine.  No need to book with a Nuro for this one.   \nUse contact lens solution 2x daily to keep it clean, 3-5 days later you will be set. Go for it! It will heal and it will be fine there is no reason your shunt would stop you from being able to get your belly button pierced! Thank you for asking this. I have been disagreements with my mom about piercing my nose as of late because she is convinced it will get infected and get my shunt infected. I meant to ask my neurosurgeon but seemed like a trivial thing to ask them. I know there is some risk, obviously, but I do not think it is that high as for your nose i really see no problem??? it is so incredibly far away, and you would have to get a HEINOUS infection for it to spread that far up? i only ask about the navel because i have a past anchor point and new anchor VERY close to my navel and i have had issues w it before, and was wondering because of structurally how that area is (abdomen) if infection would easily spread there. i am planning on getting my nose too and i think it is completely ok, but if you would like still check w ur neuro if it will make you less nervous! more talking about my tubing rather than the shunt itself because i have two anchor points really close to my navel and i do not know if an infection that close would spread to my tubing too!! i say get it re-pierced! i was mostly more referring to my tubing rather than the shunt itself, because i have two anchor points super close to my navel and was wondering if an infection there could easily spread and infect my tubing too :( Oh ok, did not think about that ... still think it should be ok and if it gets infected go to your dr so they can make sure it does not get too bad yea it seems to be ok, i was just worried about my tubing moreover rather than my shunt itself because i have two anchors really close! and i did not know if an infection there could spread easily and infect my tubing too :( yeah that is what i was thinking! i am generally not prone to infection, but i just want to make sure in case of the low chance i do get one lol I doubt that an infection would affect your tubing as it is not that close to the piercing. When I had my hysterectomy the tubing had to be held \u201c back\u201d by another surgeon while the Dr. doing the hysterectomy worked.\n   So no I would not worry about your tubing getting infected at all. Nah I am not nervous about it. I already have the home from it being previously pierced and yeah I think it is an unlikely path for an infection to travel from the nose to the shunt. But I did tell her I would research it for her sake. I can see how you would be more concerned about the belly button and it being close to the anchor, I guess I never would have even thought they were that close The shunt system is deep inside you, much deeper than a piercing will go. I have had several piercing infections that never impacted my shunt! Never dealt with belly button piercings because I am self conscious about my surgery scar i have found fun in my scars, people i do not even know ask me so many bizarre questions like if i have been a shot before etc and at this point i just take their lack of awareness as a funny joke. you should feel empowered about them, it tells a story showing that you can endure through so much more than those around you!! it is not an imperfection but rather a mark of character that tells something really unique about you. my first stomach anchor used to be minuscule but after my first tubing revision the incision did not get closed quite right so it broke open and was basically just gaping (under a patch of course, but i was at school at the time and like O_O) now it is about 5x bigger than it is supposed to be but i just like to think it shows even through all of that im still here! never feel weird showing scars, they are all pretty unique features that no one else has. \n\nalso thank u for ur help! my anchor is just like 2 inches away from my navel and i can actually feel the tubing when i press on it meaning it is not too deep, but i do not know if it is just deep enough to be ok. face and ear piercings are a bit different in my mind becuase there is so much bone you would have to go through, but i guess that is maybe more dangerous because of the amount of blood in your face opposed to fat carries an infection faster? not sure! i am just being cautious I am a fairly modified person (20+ piercings, coin slot, tattoos, coloured hair) and have had about 200 shunt revisions. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Not that it is shunt related but get a good piercer, APP is a good place to start. thank you! have any of your revisions been linked to piercing infection or placement? or just other factors? Infection from your piercings cannot get into your shunt if it is over six months old, its a closed internal system at that point. My revisions were all due to blockages and a couple of shunt infections which showed up within a month or two of getting a new shunt. I will say that I have been through a world of pain trying to keep my piercings open and healthy since they had to keep coming out for surgeries and scans but I got there in the end.

My LP shunt lasted only 7years \ud83d\ude43 While it is possible,it is highly unlikely. Mine each have (so far) lasted at most 2 years. There are some that do. I know a gal that has one and she is 49 yrs old and has never had a revision. Im 32. Last revision in 2001. Currently experiencing some issues due to the other ventricles, but the shunt itself is fine. I was told they last roughly 10 years, buuuuut my first one lasted a week. So no one really knows. Sometimes they fail inside us but our body works past it and \u201coutgrows\u201d it but the doctors do not remove it because brain surgery is traumatic for the body and might cause the hydro to flare up. A lot is still just unknown. There is no preventative care and no checkups to even see if it is still working, unless you consider ER visits routine.

Dang my shunt just turned 10 this year Mines been going since I was 6 months or so (14.5) years ago Is it possible that in certain types of Hydrocephalus, like that resulting from an IVH, after a period the shunt is no longer necessary? It seems to me that in some cases where the shunt is unchanged for decades it may just be that it is no longer necessary and possibly failed years prior. From what I read, it is, although not very common. What I read was that old school shunts had a lot less complexity to them so they tend to fail less.\n\nI would love that to be true however - mine has never been changed in 36 years and I would love to get rid of the tubing (shunt does not bother me that much).", "At Home Headache Remedy I will introduce myself.

But get the balm, not the cream. Apply it to your forehead, behind both ears at your jawline(where your jaw muscles are), and at the back of your neck. Let it work for about 45 minutes to an hour.

Ultimately ended up with severe Slit Ventricle Syndrome that I had intermittently from 2004 to 2010 and has been chronic since then. \n\nAny questions do not hesitate to ask! I have a 3 year old with Dandy Walker which caused hydrocephalus. She initially had an Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy. We were really happy with that because we were aware of the potential risks involved with a shunt. It failed after a year and she had a shunt placed. We tried to find out if there would ever be an option to go back and try the ENT again but our doctors do not try again.\n\nHave you ever been given the chance to go shunt-less with an ENT? Would you try it if given the chance?\n\nWhenever I meet someone who is willing to talk I always ask if there is any advice that you would give to a parent or if there was something that you wished you had known years ago. Unfortunately I am not a candidate for ETV so it is not something I have really looked into or know much about sorry. \n\nI think after this long I would feel strange without my shunt. I did not have one for a week after the infection diagnosis (I had external drainage) and missing my bump felt very weird!\n\nMy biggest piece of advice to parents with hydro kids is please please PLEASE do not wrap them in cotton wool. I was lucky in that my parents did not make any big deal out of my hydro (I did not really know anything about it for much of my childhood), and I did everything my siblings did. I am involved in a hydro group now where a number of the members were wrapped in cotton wool, and are now scared of EVERYTHING as adults. \n\nIn saying that, do not ignore symptoms or brush complaints off. My mother did that once (\"It is just a headache, drink some water\") and it turned out I had a blockage. She is your child, no one knows her better than you do. Trust yourself and trust your daughter. \n\nMy biggest regret is not arguing enough with my Neuro. If I had followed my gut, I probably would not have Slit Ventricle Syndrome. Never be afraid to argue or seek a second opinion. \n\nSorry for the long post. I wish you and your daughter the best of luck. Fingers crossed for a smooth journey with as few issues as possible! That is sweet to hear about missing your \"bump\".\n\nWe always research as much as we can when it comes to a new decision for her.

There was a parent who mentioned getting a trampoline for their hydro-kid for Christmas and a bunch of the members went nuts! Apparently they had all been convinced as children that doing any form of gymnastics can break the shunt, as well as many other activities (mostly sport). I tried explaining that shunts are pretty hardy (they are made of a mixture of silicone and elastic) and you have got more chance of a skull fracture than a shunt breaking within the first 7ish years of a new shunt, but they were not having a bar of it. The way some of them talk, you would think shunts were made of glass.  How are you feeling? Sorry, forgot to check in on this thread. \n\nPretty good!

", "Does anyone else have a headache 24/7, 365, with a \"working\" shunt? I have a headache every hour, every day. The only time it has gone away is for a couple weeks after the couple revisions I have had. My surgeon says maybe this is just because of the drugs I am on after surgery but I know that is not true, because after I had an ETV, I did not feel any relief like with shunt revisions, despite being on the same \"drugs\" during / after surgery. My case is as follows: \n\n**2009:** First revision since birth,  first shunt lasted quite a while. Installed programmable shunt with no anti siphon device. \n\n**2015:** headaches began and eventually stayed. During this time I grew a lot and I believe I was over draining constantly since I grew tall and my shunt had no anti siphon device. \n\n**2015-2019:** Countless ER visits hoping they would find something, ventricles always slit like. Valve would always be at a different setting. For some reason they never thought during this period that maybe the valve was broken and I was over draining, they always assumed it was just at the wrong setting and would send me home. \n\n**July 2019:** Woke up one morning with an extremely sharp pain when getting up from bed. ER confirmed ventricles had finally gotten bigger and were no longer slit like. Had a revision, for some reason, surgeon did not include anti siphon device.\n\n\\-After this surgery I had probably 20 adjustments. None helped. Turning it too high would cause a much worse headache, but I still had a constant baseline headache. \n\n**March 2020:** Shunt failed, again I felt an extremely sharp pain when rising. Shunt was revised, moved to the top of my head (was previously behind my ear) and anti siphon device was added. \n\n\\-After this surgery I again had probably 20 adjustments. None helped. Turning it too high would cause a much worse headache, but I still had a constant baseline headache. \n\n**March 2021:** ETV performed, shunt turned \"off\". Despite surgeon saying I had a 90% success score, it failed 2 weeks later pretty rapidly. It was really bad. Luckily my shunt was just \"turned off\" and they turned it back on and I was ok, back to my baseline headache.\n\n**March 2021 Post ETV** **- now.** My shunt works, they turn it up and my ventricles get bigger, turn it down and they get smaller, it is just like there is no \"right\" setting for me. My surgeon thinks the headache is a migraine. I have seen neurology after every surgery and tried so many things, and none have touched my headache at all. The only relief I have felt in the past 5-6 years is after shunt revisions for a couple weeks. I think it is because pressure is relieved but I really do not know what that means exactly. If anyone suffers similarly to me, or has in the past, have you found anything that has helped? I am feeling truly hopeless at this point, my neurologist does not know what to do, surgeon thinks it is not related to my shunt, and even a second opinion surgeon said basically the same thing. I more than anything want to stop suffering, and unsure what route to take. \n\nI am wondering if my headache is some sort of shunt-related headache. My shunt is working for sure, but I am beginning to think that this headache I have may be caused by changes in my brain caused by years of continuous over draining. If anyone has any advice, let me know, and thank you. OH MY GOSH! I have had the EXACT same experience! I have had a total of 17 surgeries, one of which was an ETV, and each one I felt relief for a few days but the headache would always come back and it never goes away except for a rare random day when it goes away for an hour or two. My day-to-day functioning occurs with a headache that ranges between 5-7 out of 10.  I had a six week period after my last shunt insertion in 2003 where I was like 'what the fuck is this? it is wonderful - but seriously what the fuck?' and then things crept back to what I consider 'normal'", "Pressure pain that lasts a few seconds (28,F) I had a programmable shunt put in a month and a half ago. Around three weeks after surgery I noticed I would get weird headaches with any type activity I would do, like walking to the store or doing chores around the house. They would immediately go away when I would lay down. The NP said this was clear symptoms of over shunting and changed my setting from 1.5 to 2. With that, all those symptoms went away but now I get pressure type headaches that last seconds at least once a day. These headaches are much more manageable than the ones I had before the setting change but I am worried I may be overlooking something and wanted to know if this happens to anyone? This type of pain sometimes ocurres when I stand up from my chair, I can feel the pressure change and I hear my shunt buzzing too.", "New Born Son Has Hydrocephalus Greetings,\n\nMy wife and I have a new born son. He was 6 weeks early. During his stay at the NICU the MD noticed his fontanelle seemed full. An MRI shows enlarged ventricles. There was some type of bleed at birth, which has self resolved , but the old blood product blocking the reabsorbtion of CSF. The neurosurgeon wants to hold off on surgery. He has no neuro symptoms and states that out comes are better the older the patient is. \n\nThe neurologist seems to think that this will self resolve and no intervention will be necessary. \n\nJust curious if anyone out there has any experience with the issue. My wife and I are emotional wrecks at this point. There seems to be so much that is unknown. Anyone that wants to share any experience, wisdom, encouragement, or advice would be appreciated. \n\nThank you all in advance.  We were in Cincinnati Children\u2019s NICU, and there were numerous hydrocephalus cases in our time there.  That is why we were admitted. \n\nMy daughter was 2 weeks early, had a severe bleed, and hydrocephalus, which resulted in her having brain surgery to insert a VP shunt.  \n\nThat is good news for your family that there is no neurological symptoms.   That is good news for your son is that the prognosis is that it can resolve itself. \n\nThe hardest thing for us was realization that we had to trust the doctors.  We could not read the MRI.  We had not even heard of this before.  We waited as long as the doctors felt comfortable hoping that it would resolve without needing the surgery. When they said she needed the surgery, she got it.  \n\nMy daughter just turned 1 year old.  She has no physical or mental impairments or developmental delays at this point.  It can end well, but it is a long, hard road.  It will be rough, but you and the mama will need each other.  Use the resources given to you.  Trust that his  doctors only want what is best for your son.  Our daughter was to term, but otherwise had the same situation. We discovered something was wrong when she was 7 days old and would vomit after every feeding. By day 9, we took her to our ped's walkin.  Her fontanelle was full, but she was dehydrated and had lost weight.  She was admitted that night to Children's Mercy in KC. After a Ct scan and then an MRI, they found she had a hemmorage and they thought the clots were blocking reabsorption. She had surgery at 8 am the next morning where they put in a temporary external vertical drain. She had this for 21 days while they slowly drained the excess fluid and gauged whether or not her body would be able to \"learn\" to self regulate.  Since the cause was a hemorrhage and not anatomical, the neurosurgeon was really hopeful it would correct itself.  It did and they did not install a shunt.  3 days before being 1 month old, we went home.  She is 2 now.  She was initially monitored with ultrasounds for the first year.  After a year, they say she no longer has hydrocephalus. She still has enlarged ventricles, but you would only know by an MRI. She has caught up to her head size. She did have a slow start to walking they think might have been caused by balance issues,  but she has hit all of her milestones.  She seems very bright and talkative and does not seem to have any lasting effects from the hydrocephalus.  We were initially worried about her not having a shunt, but the neurosurgeon said they should be used only if the body cannot self regulate.  They usually require a lifetime of revision surgeries.  If you need anything or want to talk, PM me.  It is really hard when there are so many questions that cannot be answered yet, but stay strong.  I am really hopeful for you and your family. Pm sent Thank you very much for your response. I am happy to hear your Daughter is doing well. All the stories we hear from other parents give us a very hopeful outlook. \n\nI will take your advice. Thanks again. Your daughters case sounds similar to our sons. It is gives us lots of hope. I am so glad to hear about your daughter. Thank you so much for sharing your experience  We are going thru a similar situation. Our son was born term. He had a rough delivery but overall seemed to be ok. They kept him overnight in the nicu to monitor him and he developed a fever that they could not diagnose so they sent him Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital. They did an MRI because they thought the fever might be meningitis after the MRI they noticed 3-4 bleeds and enlarged ventricles. Me and mommy were so lost, we had never experienced anything like this. They brought the neurologist team on board and we have been seeing them every 2-4 weeks for the last three months. His ventricles are still enlarged but they are hopeful they will not have to intervene. As a parent of a two year old as well, parenting a child with hydrocephalus has been so much different. Every little thing I worry about his ventricles cutting off the flow of CSF. We have not been thru as much as many have but our hearts go out to everyone that is dealing with hydrocephalus.", "..anyone with clubfeet here? I have been diagnosed with Hydro since age 10, but I was born with a host of issues including clubfeet..anyone here also have this condition?\n\nI dont expect much of a response, but will be shocked/elated if someone else out there has shared a similar life experience. Not me but my daughter had severe bilateral club feet. Her feet were basically the big toe almost touched the inside of her foot and then was kind of upside down. She could walk but on the top of her feet. Interesting did she end up getting surgery and having her clubfoot corrected? I have Hydrocephalus, I was diagnosed when I was 3 weeks old And you have clubfeet? No, I am lucky to only have Hydrocephalus Awesome. Glad to have you in this group. Thanks, same to you She had multiple surgeries that did not help due to having spina bifida, her muscles just kept going back. Since her feet were upside down and she could walk like that but not wear shoes she kept getting sores and infections. At the age of nine she decided to have an elective bilateral amputation of both feet. Spina bifida is very difficult. I hope she is managing while now and that life is good for her thank you for sharing the story. yeah, I got club feet!

This is literally how I have explained it to other people and they all think I am over exaggerating. Accurate. Had a revision at 11 y/o and I have never known peace since then This is so unbelievably true. I have only had 1 hydro headache in my life. And, the description of \"death\" could not be more accurate. I never want to experience it again and hopefully I will never have to.

I do not miss them", "I have had a VP shunt for about 6 months it was placed after I developed hydrocephalus after brain tumor removal I have had my shunt adjusted twice and am at a 1.5 setting right now. I have been having head pain for the last 2 weeks. It started off only having pain on the right side of my head when I shake my head left to right. Now it is constant and only staying on the right side. It is odd because it does not feel like pressure behind my eyes or anything just really painful and makes me feel kind of dizzy. I have not hit my head recently or fallen so I am not sure what is going on. Has anyone else experienced something like this? I am waiting for a response from my doctor. \nThanks! Everybody\u2019s different but when I was over-shunted  I was experiencing something like that where when I stepped off a curb or even walking it jarred my brain it felt like there was not enough fluid surrounding my brain and I was dizzy I think and then I got adjusted back and now I feel good. Hey! I had a sort of similar experience leading up to my shunt surgery. I would not have headaches as such or at least not as bad as I have them now- I would just feel very disoriented and dizzy when I moved my head to the left and right. For example, if somebody on my right called for my attention and I looked to my right, the room would start spinning instantly. My consultant said this was likely due to the pressure increasing/changing and the motion of movement in my head due to the CSF fluid causing unbalance. \n\nI assume if you have had your shunt setting adjusted twice that you have a programmable valve? I have heard it takes a bit of trial and error to find the right setting that works best. Maybe discuss options for switching the valve  or perhaps trialling medications for dizziness/vertigo. If those medications do not work then you KNOW it is likely the shunt. Sometimes it helps to rule things out even the things that seem trivial\u2026", "Covid Vaccine after Shunt Surgery Hey you guys I had my last brain surgery two weeks ago and want to know if anyone got the Pfizer vaccine post op and how did you heal? What were your symptoms?\nI know it is soon to get it post op and my neurosurgeon said it is okay\u2026..\nI have a codman Certas plus VP shunt. I would wait a little longer just to be safe. Surgery puts a huge stress on your immune system, as do vaccines. I would not get it sooner than a month after surgery. Please please do not seek advice on this from Reddit. Phone the surgeon or your gp. \n\nBeing dead from COVID will most certainly be worse than anything the vaccine does to you. \n\nFor you, for those around you, and (optionally) for Sparta, go get vaccinated!\n\nI have the Moderna vaccine and the same shunt. It was fine, but I slept a bit more the next day.\n\nEdit: for both doses. Thank you!\nAlso, how long have you had the current shunt ? This one got placed in.. 2019. \n\nI hope your surgery has gone well. \n\nI do recall my doctor arguing that I am at a higher risk for brain inflammation and that bumped my priority up. \n\nSo, sorry to sound like a broken record, but ask your doctor and get on it!\n\nYou are doing well, and you got this, internet stranger! I am glad you have been okay so far! And I had got a new nsg in June because my other one said he did not know what to do.\nI have had two surgeries back to back and hope I am okay now\nSo far this new nsg is great!\nThank you internet stranger! The adjustable valve is really neat well i had the vaccine and everything was until the 3rd day, i woke up with massive migraines. i was like alright its a coincidence but then woke up the 4th,5th and 6th with unbearable pain. turned out my left area valve which was natural had stopped working and fluid built up. also my right valve that i had surgery on 6 years ago was broken but was still sucking water. never fully understood whether it was the vaccine or not, but now im fine and i have had 2 new surgeries and still healing. hope i helped u get some insight I have had three new surgeries and still healing too.\nI hope the vaccine had nothing to do with your broken valves Well my best guess was that it didnt. Broken valves wasnt the problem on this case, it was the increased fluid on my brain. I appreciate the concern and hope you are doing good as well man.. have your headaches gone away? Yeah my brain kept having increased fluid too. Also, it is been less than two weeks since my last surgery . Still head pain from the surgery site and my VP shunt hurts sometimes so I am still going to be on watch. Praying this nightmare has ended . What setting are you on? Started at a 6. Now at a 4. I am at 1 Hope u get well soon bud! Its important that we report these types of increases so that more medical data can be gathered. Stay strong My dad (65 years old) had his non programmable VP shunt surgery in February of this year. He had other things going on as well (a brain tumor), so we hesitated about getting the vaccine right away. But then I asked the neurosurgeon for his advice and other doctors and they said to get vaccine ASAP. If anything, my dad was considered high risk, so it would be safer for him to be vaccinated. So he got his first dose in April and second dose in May. He was just tired with a sore arm both times. He got Pfizer. Since your neurosurgeon said it is okay then get it. I know it can feel scary after a surgery but I am sure you will be okay! Stay safe. Thanks for the tip! And I hope your dad is okay Thank you. He is okay. :) I would suggest if you do get the vaccine, make sure you have no plans the next day just in case you do feel tired or develop other symptoms so you can sleep it off. Drink plenty of water too. That is good to hear and will do! I had the same shunt as you fitted last summer. Had 2 doses Pfizer vaccine earlier this year - not even one teeny tiny side effect \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f - honestly would not even have known I would had it. I do not know how many settings there are, but you have some room to move!\n\nAdjusting it is done with a handheld device. And can be done in an exam room. \n\nMine is MRI safe, but double check yours. \n\nThey gave me a wallet card. \n\nThe danger as I understand it is that mris can cause some valves to reset. Right!\nI have the MRI resistant one Hey what shunt do you have? Its a programmable valve (i dont know good english so i might not be able to explain it really well).

At least that is one way to look at it. \n\nCan I help in some way? Both \nI know it is rare for any side effects but I am one of those ppl that are a 1% That sounds really stressful! \n\nI just spent the last bit trying to formulate a way of saying: the odds of fatal or long term effects from this disease are way higher than the odds of something going wrong with these vaccines. Especially the mRNA ones. \n\nIn what I imagine to be similar situations for me, it takes me a while to psych myself up. Even if I know it is silly. \n\nTry not to wait much longer. You got this!", "Open to talk :) Hi! I have not been on here in a long while and was wondering if anyone was open to talk :) weather it be about hydrocephalus or anything :) As a NICU parent and one with a kid with hydrocephalus I have learned to ride the wave when things are going well. Hope your all doing well and wish you all decades of no revisions! Sure, but I literally just joined Reddit. So you are going to have to let me know if there is a PM option? :)", "Our 11m son was just diagnosed Our 11 month old son just had a CT scan earlier this week because his head size shot off the charts between his checkups. Laterals and third are enlarged and they think he is got a cyst down near the base/spinal cord. An MRI is scheduled for next Thursday but it seems surgery is certain, just a matter of when and what kind/how much. My wife and I are besides ourselves.\n\nWe have already been told he is not a candidate for ETV. So it seems that as of right now there 2 options: first is just ignore the cyst and just put a shunt in. They make it sound like it is the safer option but from what I have read, it seems like revisions are common and infections are a big risk. The doctor made it sound like it is really not to big of an issue if it is all done right the first time.\n\nSecond option I think would be they go in, remove the cyst, and basically drain the fluid externally, monitor flow/pressure, and if the cyst was the cause, he gets away without a shunt. They made this seem like a riskier surgery and even then he might end up with a shunt anyway if the cyst was not the only thing causing the imbalance.\n\nI guess the positive is that he does not have any signs of issues, besides the larger noggin. So they made it sound like we have a little time to take a closer look, evaluate options, and then act instead of coming into ER and having to rush.\n\nAre there any other parents who were in this boat we have found ourselves in? Anyone by chance in the Indianapolis, Indiana area that is had this type of surgery? Any words of wisdom to share? Are they putting the shunt in the cyst or his ventricles?  My son had the external drain EVD for a few weeks.  He needed his VP replaced but had to run a course of antibiotics first.  EVD is effective it just has to be managed really closely.  We stayed in the ICU the entire time.  We have clotted brain bleeds though, so different reason for the shunt.\n\nA friends son had a shunt placed IN a cyst to drain the cyst.  Hopefully you can just have the cyst removed and get away without a permanent shunt. From what I understand, 1st option would be the shunt from the ventricles to his abdomen. 2nd option, if they we are to go in and remove the cyst, I think they drain it first and then remove it?? Then they would set up the EVD and evaluate if the cyst was the cause, and if so, possible let him get away with no shunt. But I think that is the risk, they do all that work and it turns out there is still an imbalance beyond that removed cyst, so they then do the shunt down to his abdomen anyway. We started with VP shunt at one month old.  Had a revision at 3 months, had the original shunt removed and the external shunt put in at 4 months and then a new VP inserted at 4.5 months.  We have undergone 4 shunt surgeries now.  From where I stand I would try to get away without the shunt first.  I am absolutely no doctor, but our shunt has not been as easy as it was described.  We have not had any infections or anything, just a lot of malfunction before they \u201cgot it right\u201d.  We are at Vanderbilt Children\u2019s in Nashville.

Plus, I would really want that cyst out one way or the other. I am sorry to hear that. As a mechanical engineer, I just cannot think a foreign item that can clog or get infected seems like a good idea. But I suppose if that is the only solution, then it will have to do. We have been told that risk of infection is only for the 6 months after surgery. After that, it was mostly not an issue unless his appendix ruptured or something. They also told us they do not like to use VP shunts unless they have to.\n\nWish so badly he was a candidate for ETV. But beyond that, I am not sure what is involved with getting rid of the cyst; if they can do that endoscopically or if that is like full blown open brain surgery. Our surgeries have all been quick and easy recovery, so be comforted in that regard.  It seems to be a pretty routine surgery.  Also, my son has scar tissue in his tummy from hernia removal so we have other abdomen considerations.  Shunts are really common in the preemie community. Do not know how much this helps, but my parents were in this boat when I was around the same age as your son. I had the shunt surgery as the initial suspicion was an arachnoid cyst, which did help but a second opinion was sought and it turned out that I had a loculated \"trapped\" temporal horn blocking the flow of CSF, which was operated upon and fixed.\n\nI know it was scary for my parents, and it came on the same way it did for your son - they noticed my head was a tad big for my age, and took me in for a checkup. So you did the right thing by taking action on his big noggin.\n\nI cannot offer any wisdom other than that, but I can tell you I turned out completely fine and am now a (mostly) healthy college student planning on applying to medical school. I do still have my shunt, but it is non-functioning, so it is just a cool party trick.\n\nI wish you guys and your son the best of luck; I hope everything goes well and he is successfully treated. I know it is scary, but I hope my story gives you some hope. Hugs Thank you for your post. It is hard to put what they are telling us in perspective, back and forth between thinking he will be relegated to endless surgeries his entire life to hoping he just has 1 surgery and he will be just fine for 10, 20 or more years. Thank you! From what you said, it sounds like a one or two surgery kind of situation, and I hope that is the case for him. And, no problem \u2014 I hope my perspective as someone who experienced it firsthand is helpful. My daughter, 21 months, had her VP shunt put in at 8 months, she spent her first 8 months of life in the hospital. She was born prematurely, suffered a brain bleed at birth. She has hydrocephalus. While treating her hydrocephalus, she got meningitis from the EVD. If they go that route, insist they run antibiotics preventively. Her shunt has been perfect, no issues.\nGood luck!! Thanks for your reply! Regarding antibiotics for the EVD, I think I recall hearing them say they would do that? My 3 month old had an ETV/CPC done at the end of July. He was a perfect candidate for it. Unfortunately, it only lasted 3 weeks and he had shunt put in on Thursday. His hydro was caused by a cyst too by his cerebellum and they cannot/will not remove it. Good luck! It is tough being a parent and it is even tougher with kid with medical issues. Our little ones are stronger than what we think. Also join FB groups for hydrocephalus. They are super active! Sorry to hear about his diagnosis. My sone (now 15 and doing great) was also diagnosed at 11 months with an arachnoid cyst just above the brain stem. (quadrigeminal plate) with third ventrical enlargement. In his situation, the brain had formed around the cyst, so removing it was not an option. They did try to fenestrate it (poke a hole into--not successful)  Our son did well with a VP shunt for 8 years, then ended up with lots of revisions. \n\nUltimately, he had an ETV, which he supposedly wan't  a  candidate for. FYI, although there are a few conditions that are ETV compatible from infanthood, the success rate of ETV for other cases is better when done later on.(so says the studies) \n\nSo, an ETV at ten for my son had a much better prognosis, even though one doctor said it would not work . It has been a godsend. So thankful . I would highly suggest a second opinion, if possible. Our son has had surgeries at three different hospitals, and every surgeon seemed to have a different opinion on what to do. If nothing else, we have come away from this experience that the brain is complicated, (who knew?) and that works for one will not necessarily work for another. The main thing to remember with this condition is learn the symptoms of enlarged ventricles/shunt failure and prepare to respond immediately. It is a medical emergency. \n\nTry not to worry too much, Your boy will do well, have faith. The doctors do this all the time, it is routine to them even though it is scary to us parents. Pediatric neurosurgeons are rock stars. Good! Ours did not run them and looking back, I wish we had known, it likely would have soared her a lot of complications, and got us home in half the time. Thank you for your reply. I have found a couple FB groups that will probably be helpful. What is a CPC? Thanks for your reply. Fenestrate, that is the word I heard them say. I think they are planning to use the MRI results to see if that is possible for him and if so, I guess try it and then monitor with a EVD and then we just hope that \"popping\" the cyst will restore balance. But the surgeon said based on the size of his laterals and third that she suspects it is not just the cyst?\n\nI would read about calculating success of the ETV, so I suppose there is a chance later on to get it, although I am still a little unclear that the requirement is that makes a candidate.\n\nRegarding 2nd opinions, we are currently working with Dr. Jodi Smith in Indianapolis. Everything we have read says she is good, and our son's ped doctor said she is great, but I have never had to \"shop\" for a neurosurgeon, I dunno if you can just use online reviews, you know? There is a doctor at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital, I think ranked in the top 10 maybe, and he is somehow in-network. Not sure if we should look into that or if we even have time, another thing I am unclear on. Hello!\n\nI was thinking about you &amp; your son and wondered if he had his MRI yet? Do you have a clearer idea of what approach makes the most sense now? Sending good thoughts to you all. Feel free to contact me anytime for questions or support. Thank you for asking! He got his MRI and had surgery for a VP shunt a week ago, all went well and is going well so far!\n\nLeading up to surgery was very, very, stressful. First doctor told us he has an arachnoid cyst down near his stem and 4th ventricle, not a candidate for an ETV, and his hydrocephalus was communicating and the cyst was not causing a blockage and therefore recommended a VP shunt. We got a second opinion from another neurosurgeon. He told us our first opinion was clearly wrong and that it was non-communicating hydrocephalus and clearly the cyst was blocking flow and recommended an ETV. We got that 2nd opinion the afternoon before he was scheduled to have the shunt surgery the next morning. We were panicked, not sure what to do, and confused\\stressed. By some miracle, my wife remembered she was Facebook friends with a lady who is husband is also a neurosurgeon. Thankfully we were able to get a 3rd opinion that evening. He was able to review the MRI and everything! We figured what more a compelling opinion can we get from a neurosurgeon who does both procedures and has kids himself and told us if it were his child, he would do the shunt and not the ETV.\n\nSo... Shunt it was! The next morning they actually reshuffled surgery to the next day, so he went in the following day and had his shunt put in. No issues so far, and he is recovering like a champ! We have amazed how quickly he is recovering, it is amazing! Fingers crossed that he has few issues with it! Oh, that is wonderful! So glad he is recovering well. It is incredibly stressful leading up to surgery and trying to decide what to do. I am always surprised that there are so many different opinions. I do not think it means that one surgeon is necessarily \"better\", but hey, when 2 of them concur, you definitely made the right call. So similar to our son, arachnoid cyst near the stem and diagnosed at 11 months! His was near the third ventricle. Sending healing thoughts his way, he sounds like he is going to do great! Sorry to hear about your kid. My son was diagnosed and shunted on the same day. He was about to turn one. \n\nHis worked well for 1.5 years then quite a few issues. We were offered the ETV,we took it,but it failed too. They moved the shunt to left side and so far it is been good. \n\nHindsight, I would have never agreed to an ETV. ETVs and shunts have extremely similar rates of failure.  The ETV is the more riskier option. \n\nShunts fail, as you know.  You will need emergency treatment when it fails.  The other main issue to look out for is overdrainge.  It can lead to some serious problems down the line.\n\nBest of luck to you guys! At 6 weeks old  surgeons tried to take care of my arachnoid cyst and it worked for 5 months before they had to place my shunt.  Sounds like your son and I have the same sort of cyst in similar areas.  I have been very fortunate to have had only 3 revisions in 48 years.  Hope everything turns out well, best of luck to you and your family.\n\nAll my surgeries were performed at Mott Children's hospital in Ann Arbor.", "Headache after 3 month symptom free. Hi, I am new here.\n\nI had an endoscopic third ventriculostomy performed in December for non-communicating hydrocephalus. \n\nEverything was fantastic post-op, all my symptoms resolved and it is the most well I had felt for a long time. However, in early March I developed a sudden spontaneous headache which has been constantly persisting ever since. It is debilitating and I am struggling to cope with daily tasks. \n\nMy GP suggested I try migraine meds but these have made the symptoms worse. The pain is aggravated by lying down, lifting, bending and reaching. \nI had a pressure study performed in hospital which came back normal.\n\nHas anyone else experienced headaches like this and found a way to alleviate them?  Unfortunately ETVs can not work very well and fail just like a shunt.  That is incorrect, if I am understanding what you are saying.  Yes, an ETV can fail, but typically the longer you have it, the chances of it failing dramatically drop. They do not fail over time in the same way that a shunt does. And you can have it fixed. The symptoms do sound concerning. In our (shunt days) experience, tests came back okay on occasion, and there was still a problem. You should have a neurologist, not a GP, working with you as well, although I have to admit that was no help to my son. At least they are specialists in headaches.  An ETV was a godsend for my son at ten. At fifteen, he does still have headaches, from time to time. But they are mild for the most part. Shunts were horrible for him, they kept failing and he had no quality of life with terrible, debilitating headaches. Post ETV, it took him about six months to nearly eliminate his headaches, but they were not as bad post surgery as OP's are now. That is simply not true. Based on research, a shunt and an ETV can fail at any given time. They both have almost exactly the same failure rate. The ETV can close slowly,so the symptoms are not severe at first. I have been back to my GP today who has processed a referral to a neurologist but advised that there is quite a wait (no indication of how long).\nI have review consultation with MRI scan on 18th May. \nFor the time being I am now using anti- inflammatory tablets to see if it helps. Headache pills will not touch a hydrocephalus headache as it is not due to blood vessel constriction. The only thing you can do is lay down to change the pressure inside your head. As that usually helps.\n\nI may well be incorrect in terms of a EVT as it may well behave differently.  I hope that the docs get you up &amp; running again. This is my first time doing anything on Reddit so I hope I am doing it right \ud83d\ude05 Anyway, I saw my neuro-opthamologist and neurosurgeon recently and they had a couple suggestions for headaches. I have been drinking coffee and low-calorie electrolyte drinks because they help with CSF production and flow apparently. Has not completely gotten rid of my headaches but I notice a difference if I do not drink any. Nuun tablets and banana bag powder on Amazon are the best electrolyte drinks I have tried, although the banana bag one does not taste very good. \n\nI have also been hearing that Excedrin Migraine helps immensely with hydrocephalus headaches, but have not tried it yet. I have also noticed a difference if I eat less processed foods and cut out dairy and gluten. I hate to even mention that because it seems \u201ctrendy\u201d to do that, but the foods we eat can hugely influence CSF production and flow. I hope you find something that works for you! Thanks it is interesting to see what helps other people. I have been drinking more coffee and water and have not been too physically active this past week. The pain is slightly improved but I am still plagued with these damn visuals which do not respond to migraine meds at all. They are just as bad in the dark which has meant a lot of crashing into things trying to find light switches!\n\nI have been informed that there is a 15 week wait to see a neurologist so I am going to try and get my health and wellbeing team at work to try and help expedite it. (I work at the hospital my appointment is at).  I am reluctant to take another week off but it is affecting my ability to look at a computer screen and bend/lift/stretch. :( I have an ETV. For me personally, there have been a few times were I thought I was having a Hydrocephalus related headache but it was actually lifestyle problems. Drinking more water and eating healthier has helped me minimize my non-Hydrocephalus headaches.", "Covid vaccine &amp; hydrocephalus/shunt Idk if this type of question has been posted on here, but I am (30F) looking for advice and insight on taking the Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer, to be specific).\n\nI had made the decision to go get the vaccine a couple of weeks ago, because my thing is, the vaccine lessens your chances of contracting the virus. And if you do contract it the symptoms might not be as bad as without the vaccine.\n\nBut my mom got in my head about the risks of the vaccine, looking at the fact I have hydro, and that taking spike protein could pose a danger to me. So she suggested I do some research first, before making a definite decision. I have not found solid info on the internet so I thought I would get on here and get some insight from you all.\n\nIf you have taken the Pfizer vaccine, have you had any symptoms from it? What was that experience like? I was advised that hydrocephalus did not really come into the decision to get vaccinated or not. I got vaccinated with the Pfizer in my role as a healthcare worker and I have had very few ill effects. A sore arm and what felt like a slight hangover for a day or two after each shot, and then nothing. Happy to try to answer any questions you may have! Thank you so much for your response! The effects you are describing are what I have heard non-hydro people say they have gone through, which eases my mind I have had Pfizer and had no side effects at all other than a sore arm for a couple of days The sore arm thing is what I have heard a lot of people mention. Glad you did not have to deal with too many side effects! Got moderna - not an issue as all except a day later like everyone else is saying Same  here for 1st one, second felt a bit tired and flu like for a day or two but then back to normal Get the shot Get the vaccine. My dad (65 years old) got Pfizer. He has hydrocephalus, a brain tumour, plus other underlying health conditions. He only had a sore arm after getting both his shots. I asked his neurosurgeon and even he recommended to get the vaccine. I have a VP shunt for hydrocephalus and I have had the Pfizer vaccine. I have had no symptoms from the vaccine whatsoever. My wife has a shunt and got J&amp;J. at most she felt like she had a flu like 8 hrs after the shot. It lasted a few hours and then she felt fine. I do not know why so many people post about this here. Why in the hell should there be any correlation between a mRNA vaccine and a physical shunt in your head?\n\nGot both Pfizer doses, no issues at all, by the way.\n\nVaccinate, it is for your sake and for everybody else's. My wife (34F) has hydrocephalus and got Moderna on recommendation from her neurosurgeon while still recovering from recent surgeries and meningitis (2-3 mo post-op). No issues-- I actually had worse side effects than she did after the second shot... My 15 year old with a shunt got the vaccine and has had no side effects. There is no danger. Get vaccinated I will add to the crowd and say I have been fully vaccinated (Moderna) since February 2021. I have had a VP shunt for 30+ years. No issues whatsoever, aside from a sore arm and feeling cruddy for a day after each shot. \n\nHydrocephalus is not contraindicated for any of the available COVID-19 vaccines in any way, so I hope you are able to get yours ASAP! :) It is more about the illness than the shunt itself. I wanted to be certain that the vaccine would not have any major ill-effects. And after everyone is comments, I will definitely be going for the vaccine. So thank you. I was just doing a little due diligence, that is all Sorry if I came down too harsh. Of course, there _could be_ side effects in a very minor percentage of people, but I do not think that there will be any relation to hydro. You should be safe :) No worries, apology accepted. I appreciate your input and reassurance. It means a lot I know I am a bit late to this thread but I also have Hydrocephalus and got the pfizer vaccine...The day after I got the second shot I did throw up but other than that nothing happened to me other than a sore arm. I have never heard of that side effect before\u2026sheesh. Sorry you had to go through that It is fine...it was just once Okay. Glad you are okay Thanks No worries!", "Getting a shunt installed tomorrow Getting a shunt installed tomorrow after 2 failed ETVs. Wish me luck. Welcome to the club! Good luck! Good luck! I have the same story...2 ETVs and a shunt later...Good luck. Wishing you all the best! Good luck hope your recovery is quick and painless! I wish you the best of luck, I have had 3 shunts placed (2 in the head and 1 in the torso) along with an ETV later on and it is a bumpy ride for sure. I will be praying for you and that everything goes well.", "Is it normal for this spot to be \u2018squishy\u2019? I was feeling along my shunt today and noticed it- should I get it checked out?  If you have experienced any change, just shoot your doc a question. I have a VA shunt so mine does not go that way, but if it feels off and weird, cannot hurt to ask your doc Not a doctor here, just my experience from having a shunt - but my VP Shunt (**v**entriculo - **p**eritoneal) goes from head to stomach. where it is in my neck, it is a rubbery catheter encased in a plastic tubing (protects actual shunt from disconnecting/clogging/breaking.\n\nOnce the shunt goes past the shoulder/heart area, its really all rubber, no plastic. this is due to the following:\n\n* It was placed there when I was 2, so I grew to 6' 2\" - the rubber material allowed the shunt to \"grow with me\" - plastic cannot really do that\n* rubber moves with my body when I am exercising\n\nTLDR - I think you are correct - its supposed to be squishy because the abdomen area cannot really take the plastic of the shunt. also, I even get pain from the rubber part of the shunt poking my diaphram. that pain is felt in my chest and even goes to the back of my shoulders. If you have any symptoms,then I would contact medical advice. I have seen this exact picture and question before several days ago. Is this your picture?", "*Not looking for an online diagnosis* My stress level is through the roof right now. I just had a CT scan ordered by a GP and he said \u201cventricles appear smaller than normal but this may be normal for you\u201d. I did not know I could view my test results and I opened the explanation of the CT... I have a VP shunt that was placed at birth 28 years ago. It said there is a \u201cSlitlike appearance of the left ventricle where the shunt is inserted into the left horn. There is also a slitlike appearance of the right ventricle but to a lesser degree than the left.\u201d This sounds like over-drainage. I have had SEVERE fatigue, depression, anxiety, and bad concentration for YEARS. I just recently had horrible appetite not caused by antidepressants because the bad appetite started meaning months before I started zoloft. The only symptom I do not have is headaches so it was not obvious I could be having shunt problems before. DOES THIS SOUND LIKE SHUNT PROBLEMS TO ANYONE ELSE? I AM PANICKING! I am pretty inexperienced (my young child has hydrocephalus and a VPN shunt), but it seems plausible. \n\nTo me it sounds like over drainage could explain why the ventricles are small. But if the doctor does not have a frame of reference from a few years ago, they probably cannot make an assumption about whether this is how your ventricles have always been, or if there is been a change.\n\nDo you have a follow up visit scheduled to talk about the results? I am following up with neurology That is one reason why you should always try and gave scans done when you are feeling well. This is even more important for children who cannot verbalize how they are feeling. Having a baseline healthy brain scan to compare later scans too can be invaluable. tbh it does i hope you get treated properly Over drainage is a major issue with shunts. Slit like is better than slit ventricle syndrome. Have they measured the pressure in your head? I am not a neurosurgeon but I do have hydro and am a medical student. All shunts overdrain to some degree, since they create a abnormal pathway. If you have had this shunt through early and late adolescence it is likely that your ventricles have become slit like due to a bit of overdraining as your brain has grown with the shunt while slightly overdraining. \n\nI had the same scenario, scans looked slit like, and I had only a constant headache. After 3 years of this, I woke up with a horrible pain, it was fully blocked. What happened is the catheter in my head was partially blocked but still flowing a little... you may want to mention the possibility of a partial proximal obstruction to your NS and ask if they can rule it out. Wish I had done that sooner. \n\nBest of luck", "Medtronic valve recall- Notified months after the fact and now I need my first revision. Please help? Reposted due to title. (\n\nI got my first shunt this January 27, 2021 and I am only just now finding out that the valve has been recalled. I have been having ongoing pressure issues since getting the shunt. \nI have had a painful lumbar puncture and like 6 pressure adjustments since then. I do not know why it took this long to get notified. It seems like I was only told because of the fact that I was also, in the same phone call, told that my surgeon not only left the practice but I cannot see the acting nurse practitioner who is treated me ever since and who I have become to trust. She is referring me to another surgeon?/ doctor, thankfully in the same office, but I feel blindsided. \n\nMedtronic initiated the recall about two weeks before my surgery, and the recall was official two weeks after. I do not know how this oversight could have happened, if it was a failure of communication from my surgery team or what. But I have been sick for months, and they were exploring the possibility that I did not need a shunt or I may have a CSF leak. I guess I am kind of just shocked, upset, and feel physically sickened about this situation and needing my first revision surgery to replace the valve. I knew another surgery was a possibility with this condition but hoped it would not be so soon, my first brain surgery and then the shunt surgery were pretty traumatic and recovery was rough. I am afraid of what I will feel like after the surgery and how I will look with my head shaved again after my hairs finally growing back in from January. \n\nCan anyone tell me about their first revision, or offer any advice? Should I expect it to be as tough a recovery as getting the shunt itself? Has anyone else ever had their hardware recalled, and what was the process like? It looks like the reason for the recall is just that it may be harder to read the setting from an x-ray/CT, so there is not thought to be a problem with the functioning, which is why it would not have been replaced as soon as it was confirmed. The analogy I was told is to treat shunts like a house of cards - they will not risk intervening until it is actually collapsed (failed). As you say you have had adjustments, I would guess that means the setting is readable so yours must not be too badly affected by radiopacity issues, if at all. (I am no expert of course, that is just my understanding from a quick skim read and 14 years with a Medtronic Strata shunt).\n\nAs for your questions about revisions, I was a baby when I had my shunt placed so cannot compare with that surgery, but can tell you that if all goes to plan you will just need some paracetamol and to stay in hospital for at least a couple of nights (depending on the policies at your particular hospital or insurance or whatever - I am basing this off my experience in NHS England hospitals). I have not ever had imaging to check my settings before it is adjusted, but I did have a shunt x-ray series to check if the tubing was in the right place in my abdomen. I do not remember if the NP ever said anything about setting reading issues. But it sounds like she believes there is a functional issue as well and she said I am one of many patients with the same problems and the same shunt. I will not really know details until the new surgeon contacts me but she said I am definitely getting a revision. I keep getting sicker and have a bunch of symptoms of shunt functional problems. \n\nThanks for your insight about the recall, and the analogy, it makes sense. I guess mine and other patients decided to fail or something on top of being recalled, I really do not know.  leaving this thread up for anyone who may relate I guess, but as an update my shunt is failing and its not necessarily due to the recall so I will be getting a revision and possibly a different shunt, not medtronic, put in. Failure most likely due to anti-siphoning device malfunction, not the valve issues stated on the recall. when I wrote this thread I was given the impression the failure was related to the recall. Medtronic screwed everything up for me and I have had back to back surgery due to how it affected my vents. You should reach out to hydrocephalus association about the oversight If you are okay with sharing can you tell me a little bit more about how it is effected your vents? \nMy new surgeon is saying the shunt never helped my slit ventricles which is opposite to what I was told previously. And he is saying the anti siphon device in the shunt is probably what is malfunctioning, which is not what the recall is about. It feels like it is been broken the whole time it been in my head. It could be completely different than your case though. \n\nCan I ask what you mean by reaching out to them? In what way do you think hydro association could help? My vents were normal from 2018-2020 BUT because of Medtronic resetting itself several times . \nThis is speculation but ever since my vents collapsed in March 2020 during a revision it is been hell for me\nCall HA and speak to a rep about the devices . Or call Medtronic.\nI had an anti siphon device in July that caused a CSF leak so I ended up having another revision nine days later .

Curious since I am supposed to get a VP shunt but someone told me to look at a VA shunt as an alternative which is not done as often since it is only taught at four schools (neurosurgery residency).

I forgot to add that VA shunts are for adults only. Non programmable VP :) Thanks! Those are better/less problematic than programmable with anti-syphon valves? I have no idea lol. What is a syphon valve? Ihave a strata programmable vp shunt. Best option imo as the programmable nature allows adjustment to patients. Non programmable can lead to intense recovery and finding new normal will be hard, if the pressures to high or too low.

Anyone else? Anyone experience ringing in your ears as a symptom of ETV issues/failure?

I never had ringing in my ears until I had a shunt malfunction. I guess it could be a normal person thing too, but it amps up when I am sick. Mine is 24/7- right ear has 40% hearing loss from prolonged pressure on the auditory nerve and the left ear just started ringing at the beginning of my issues We thought the same thing after the third ventriculostomy (sp?) Everything thing was fine for years then...symptoms back with a vengeance... Tinnitus is a normal condition that should not last more than a few moments, but when it lasts for days on end there is some driving issue. I have read some where that ringing in ears could be a sign of high BP. Though, I do not know how accurate it is. This is the first time hearing of this possibility. And any time I get ringing in my ear, it is in the opposite ear of where my VP shunt is. And I had a revision 4 or 5 years back. But the OP might be right too. Hope this helps I have had constant ringing in my left ear since I had my VP install. I had an ETV and experienced ringing in my ears as well as CSF leaking from my wound. Went to the ED and found out that my CSF was not draining down the hole they had created and was building up in my ventricles again, thus creating ringing in my ears.", "How safe are shunt revisions? I was born with hydrocephalus, and my last revision was 10 years ago when I was 12. Im now 22, for the past 4 years I have been having headaches non stop 24/7... changes in the valve setting do nothing, my ventricles are very slit like and are causing me headaches. Because of my \u201cnormal\u201d scans and headache being my only symptom, I have been told for years it is just migraines. Finally, I found a neurosurgeon who said my valve is not working, (it does not nudge when they try to reprogram it, and when they do, my ventricles do not respond and headache does not change) so I am going to have only the valve replaced with an anti siphoning device, some time in the next 1-2 months I am going to have the procedure done. I am extremely scared, when I had surgery 10 years ago I was a kid and did not know what was really going on to a degree, now being older and knowing more about the possible complications, I am pretty nervous. I know there is always the possibility of issues, but is a simple valve replacement generally safe? \n\nAlso, my current shunt is barely noticeable, does anyone here have an anti siphoning device, and is it noticeable / does it stick out? \n\nThank you. Every surgery comes with risks. It really depends,  are they just going to replace the valve or the whole shunt? They will probably make that decision once you are theatre.  \n\nRevisions are generally easier. Full replacements carry additional risks. But generally they are not complex surgeries. They would be just replacing the valve and adding an anti siphoning device, unless there are other issues As the person before stated, all surgeries come with risks, but from August 2018 to June 2019 I have had a total of I think 10 revisions including different types and pressures of shunts placed, valve replacements, catheter replacements, and even almost 2 weeks with an EVD and I am only 19. I have not had any problems but I know everybody is different. I currently have an anti siphon medium pressure shunt valve and to answer your question about it being noticeable, mine is a lot harder to see than the previous delta 1 valve and the programmable. I feel like I have not completely answered your questions, but I hope this helps a little bit. Well I am alive after having my shunt replaced for the first time after 30 years in February.   My surgery was a bit complicated but I did not know until after it was all done when I found out I had 3 incisions.  One on the side of my dead, one on my neck and one on my stomach.  They tried but failed to remove part of my old shunt so it is still inside me disconnected and the new one is over top of the old one\n\n  I had a lot of pain for about a month but medication helped.  on the plus side I got to take 3 weeks off work with pay and stay in bed having people bring me food.  That was nice.\n\nI was not too worried about the procedure it is basically like falling asleep and waking up but more sudden.  I just remember them putting the mask on me then waking up in recovery. As someone else said every surgery had risks. However what you are having done should not be too long is surgery etc.\n   You will probably do just fine!!\nI have had several surgeries like this.... no issues at all....ever", "Covid-19 and Hydrocephalus ", "I am having surgery in the next week I have illustrated both high and low pressure symptoms throughout every day, so it is surgery!

I have had hydrocephalus since I was an infant and have not had any revisions on my shunt since, but sometimes when I am out in public I feel very self conscious about the tube running underneath my skin. Nope. We are bad asses. We survived brain surgery! Yeah i had my shunt put in at around 15-16 (I am 21 now) so I just used a lot of humor to get me through. I use it as a weird party trick now lol. I like telling drunk people I was abducted by aliens and they put a probe inside of my head, then let them feel my tube running down my neck and my lil head bump\ud83d\ude39 also bro you survived brain surgery you are a certified badass now. Thanks so much! I really felt alone before encountering this community. True dat. I will keep this in mind every time I feel self conscious again! When I was younger, I used to have my hair long enough to cover my shunt. Now,  I cut my hair really short. My shunt shows, plain as day. Hell, it is a lot easier for me. I can just get up and go. I do not have to worry about fixing my hair. I do. I feel like it is kind of pathetic that my brain cannot find away to just move the fluid around. It is very upsetting. Also having to tell people I have a shunt I feel like a dork. You know that show brace face? That is exactly how I feel although I have a shunt and not braces. I do not feel badass when my bosses question why I have migraines and do not just take Advil... Send your boss my number, I will show him what it looks like when a brain is trying to push itself out of a skull, and why a shunt is necessary. Not at all. I have had a shunt for three decades and proudly sport a scar on my head and the scar on my stomach.  \n\nSummertime is the best because then I get to walk around with no shirt, people ask me questions which is awesome because I like when people ask me rather than just staring at my scars.\n\nHaving a medical condition is not something that we want but it is something that we have so it is time to shit or get off the pot/ accept what you have and make the best of it. Never, my first tubing was a lot larger than when the tubing was moved in 2001....you can hardly see it (I would have to point it out to you). My first tubing is still visible...and well, I just really do not even think about it. \n\nSo, the answer is no.\n\nYou do not say how old you are, but please, do not worry about someone seeing the tubing or noticing it. \n\nI have never had anyone other than a TSA at the airport ask me a question when flying and I carry information that I have a shunt, etc. I have in the past allowed TSA to touch the shunt and I did let them feel the tubing too, but it was only because they were really interested. The TSA worker was polite and appreciative that I did not have an issue showing or talking to her about it.\n\nAs someone else here said 'We are bad-asses....!!!\" We survived brain surgery!!!\n\nI guess I look at it in a different light. I do not owe anyone an explanation AND no one asks me about it,\n\n I mean think about it, HOW CLOSE does someone have to get to you to notice the tubing? I have NEVER had anyone say \"Hey, what is that bump/line looking thing under your skin? \" TBH.....sure, we all know it is there, but people really do not and as long as you do not make an issue out of it, no one is honestly going to know.\n\nI think everyone else here has a great attitude about it as well, and I hope that helps you! \n\n(((((HUGS))))) It is not that your brain cannot figure out how to move fluid around. It is more like there is not a drain for excess fluid to get out and the shunt acts like that drain. Everyone is constantly making, circulating and absorbing csf. I have never met anyone who thinks hydrocephalus is dorky, but I do not interact with people age 7-18. My advice is learn up on it so you can dumb it down for people with more confidence. \n\n\nPeople are good at hiding what they perceive as their negative traits and the vast majority of us are not perfect. We also rarely notice minor details about others. I honestly cannot remember what I worse yesterday and could not tell you anything medically wrong with the hundreds of people I interacted with minus people wearing glasses or splints. What you may see as the tubing of your shunt system most people will overlook entirely because they either cannot see it or think it is a vein, tendon, or muscle. Seriously though, you do not need to be self conscious. I actively look for people with shunts when I am out. I live in a big city, and I am out and about for work during the day so I see and interact with lots of people. In the almost three years I have been doing this I have noticed zero shunts. It is statistically improbable though that I have not interacted or come across a person with hydrocephalus. When my daughter was diagnosed I was actually approached by someone I had known a long time who told me she had hydrocephalus and a shunt. Prior to exposure to hydrocephalus I knew nothing about it and certainly was not aware of treatments like shunts. Now that it is a part of my life I seek it out and it is so subtle that my hyperaware craziness still cannot visually point out shunted individuals. There are times when I definitely feel inferior, like I am brain damaged and stupid, because of hydrocephalus. Everyone has something, though. I am sure you should not judge someone else for their problems, you should do the same for yourself. It is bad enough to have hydrocephalus, we should not be willingly punishing ourselves any more than life already has.   \n\n\nAs far as the physical aspect of it, I had surgery at age 17, when I reached the 13 year anniversary at age 30, I decided to shave my head and show off my scar that I had always kept covered with hair (luckily male pattern baldness is not in my genes). I love this! I am keeping this in mind for when I go back to work after brain surgery #12. Thanks fellow hydro warrior. Yeah I have a different style / take on how people accept hydrocephalus symptoms.  \n\nWe have all come so close to death that people who do not want to understand us, or do not support us, can just beat it.  \n\nI have had a couple episodes where I ended up in a coma for several days each, so I may have a different/aggressive take on how others treat me.   \n\nBrain surgery is brain surgery, and if not for our medical systems we would not be sitting around right now (in our underwear) checking out Reddit posts. I got my shunt when I was an infant as well, I am 18 now and I can honestly say I do not really care if someone points out the tubing running down my neck or the small bald spot I have got from where the hair does not grow back. I mean, I used to get called a robot and that kind of stuff when I was little, but you just sort of get over it, and as soon as I did that, I realized no one really cared and it was all in my head (mwahaha). But then again, for some reason I had a buzz cut all of my childhood, so now that ive got a side part it does make it a lot less noticeable, but then again, I work construction now and so as I am lifting, straining, and just turning my head, the tubing in my neck becomes much more prominent (apparently according to a co-worker I know from HS) but I do not really care, and if someone points it out, I just inform them about what it is. On the bright side, if ya phrase it right you can make it sound much cooler. Nope. Not at all. When I tell people about my shunt, they actually want to feel it. They think it is cool. Nobody has ever said anything about my scar on my stomach. It is funny because four days after writing this post I had my second shunt revision and was hospitalized for two days after undergoing surgery. Now I have two scars on my stomach! Oh wow. Hopefully everything went well. Scars just shows that we lived a little. LoL I think I am going to have adopt your way of thinking. Now THAT is badass. Im not embarrassed at all, and i even keep my hair military short in case i need surgery some day neuro's dont give good haircuts. lol ive had 5 surgeries since 1970 and im lucky to be able to live a self sufficient life. It is not something i asked for, but i have no choice but to try to make the best of this life as i wont get another. My scar shows when i have my hair short sometimes its a conversation starter to explain my condition. I like to teAch people things they may not know and give them insight and understanding. Me too !! When i tried to grow my hair i always needed surgery so i just started keeping it military short high n tight is my fav hairstyle im an ex army brat.", "Has anyone on here had an ETV done as an adult, with a previous shunt? I am a good candidate for ETV because I have aqueductal stenosis, but I have had shunts since I was little. I am 23 and only had 4 surgeries in my life, but 2 in the past year, and I am having pretty bad luck with shunts recently. I am most likely getting an ETV done in the beginning of next year, but super worried as I do not know what to expect since I have only ever had shunts. All my revisions have gone good with discharge the following day, is ETV the same if there are no initial complications? \n\nI hate the issues the shunts cause, all the adjustments, over drainage etc, it really brings on a second condition almost, I hope that ETVs can grant me freedom from that. Anyone here had a successful ETV done as an adult? Feel yourself lucky to be a good candidate to have an ETV. If it is successful you will be free again \ud83d\ude01 ive two ETVs but it did not work so I got a shunt...i dont like it...\u2639\ufe0f Did they tell you what your chance of successful ETV was? I know shunts suck, I have one now on the top of my head, super uncomfortable most of the time. Also, was ETV surgery recovery similar to shunt? 90% + \u2639\ufe0f. Everything is much easier...so good luck. I also have aquaductal stenosis. I am 24 and had an ETV done first then a shunt. My ETV did not work and I was back in hospital 2 weeks after it was done with a CSF infection.\n\nI now have a shunt in and although I have had no issues with my shunt and it is working perfectly, I would much prefer to not have it in and have had my ETV work the way it was supposed to. I did not have the chance to experience full recovery after my ETV but from what I did experience, it was 10000000x easier than recovering from shunt surgery. A few days after my ETV surgery, I was starting to feel like my normal self and was pain free vs a few weeks after my shunt surgery, I was still in a lot of pain and experiencing things like short term memory loss and issues with forming sentences. I was discharged 2 days after ETV surgery (would have been the day after surgery but I had a temperature so they would not let me go home.) Thanks for your reply!, do you know what your predicted success of ETV surgery was? Do you know if you have aqueductal stenosis? Yes - I also have aqueductal stenosis.

My 22 month-old toddler has had a VP shunt since her 21st day of life.  She has not had any revisions or any malfunctions yet. *knocks on wood* \n\nMy little one has been acting strange today.  Her pediatrician told us that we would definitely know if it occurred.  It is just had to distinguish between neurological symptoms and toddler things.  Our 1st scare turned out to be her first virus and our 2nd scare turned out to be teething.  \n\nParents who have had to deal with revision and/or malfunctions in the past.  What were the symptoms? What did you experience?  Were there any early warning things you noticed?  \n\nI have searched this subreddit for an hour without any results.   I have got a toddler about the same age. She is about 20 months, depending on how you count as she was born extreme premature in GW 25. Also had a shunt for the majority of her life.\n\nWe have had a few setbacks. We got a new one exactly a year ago. She had been very tired for the past few days and got to the point to having oggy eyes. Not just being herself in general. Cannot remember if she had a fever though, but it was very much noticable. We got into the trauma room, and a few hours later she got a new shunt with accute surgery. It was quite critical. Apparantly the tube was totally blocked and had been for a while.\n\nWe had another scare this summer too. This time we really thought \"this is it\", kind of. She got fever and started throwing up - exactly what you are **not** supposed to do being a shunt-bearer. However it turned out it was \"just\" an ear infection, which got away quite quickly... but man, this almost scared me out the most, becuase it was so sudden! She was fine the one afternoon, then on the evening it just came from nowhere. The first scare with the oggy eyes part, had been going on for a few days and it kind of sank in. But, in retrospect, we should have gone to the emergency room even quicker. \n\nFurthermore, currently we are undergoing another pennicillin treatment. Unfortunately skin bacterias got apparant / came in somehow during the last surgery. So, as of February'18, her skin has been kind of bruised up to the point now that it is extremely irritated, due to a staphylococci infection. Will have a new surgery within a few days to remove the shunt and put a new one on the other side. It is really a bummer on so many levels, will be her 5th surgery in total :( \n\nSo, my experience is that there could be so many things that can go wrong with the shunt on so many levels. I really much agree with what your NS is saying, that you notice if there is anything APPARANTLY wrong (i.e. temperature rise, oggy eyes, tiredness). But, that staphylococci infection we are currently undergoing, was something we just kind of noticed because we are very \"picky\" about the visuals of the area around the shunt / tube, we inspect it daily. \n\nIt really sucks the situation we are in as parents. Best of luck to you and your child &lt;3 Hey, furry\\_cat, just a quick heads-up:  \n**apparantly** is actually spelled **apparently**.

My 18 month old got her first shunt around a month old and has had 2 revisions. Vomiting, lack of appetite, and lethargy are always scary with her because it can mean a failed shunt. The problem with those is that kids get them all the time for other colds. Difficulty sleeping even while being held is a pretty big sign something shunt related is up because usually when sick she will sleep with or on a parent . The real give away for us that something is wrong is EYE CONTACT and LOOKING UP. She will absolutely not / cannot make good eye contact when her cranial pressure is high. I cannot remember if her pupils were reactive or not, but lack of eye contact and poor tracking have always been bad signs.\n\nDuring one failure her symptoms were noticeable before her ventricles even became enlarged (according to mri and X-ray). I assume this is because she could feel the slight pressure change before the ventricles became seriously enlarged. \n\nMalfunctions seemed to manifest themselves over a period of around 36-48 hours for us, but I am guessing that changes by the person and how quickly they produce ceribral spinal fluid.  My daughter has thankfully went 11 years so far without a revision, but I am super paranoid and will rush her to the er if I think anything might be slightly off. When it comes to kids, especially that young, better safe than sorry. You will be the first to know if something is off, trust your instincts and get to the hospital of you think she needs to go.  Thank you so very much for sharing your experiences.  I know it is not easy to relive this, but I truly appreciate it.  I wish you and your family the best. Thank you for your words of encouragement.  Stupid bots can eat a dick.   I pray you little one is okay.  \n\nI am glad you shared this with me and anyone else that reads this.  The doctors have to tell us things in their doctor way with their doctor logic keeping in my mind all of those doctor lawsuits.  We, as parents, can do better for each other. We can share our stories and insights without that veil.   Thank you.  Happy to help. FYI the revision procedures were all less than an hour.  Hi everyone, my son is 3 and no revisions (knock on wood).  Thank you for this question and answers. I am terrified everyday the he is going to wind up in the ER. I wish everyone of you parents the best.  Not sure if you read all the replies here so sorry if it is redundant. My daughter is one and a half and had two revisions. Our neurosurgeon said revisions are common in kids under two because of how the brain is growing and developing at that age. The thought of revisions is usually on my mind, though I have learned more to enjoy the present when things are going well. That being said her failures have taken a few days to manifest into problems so we have had ample time to get her treatment. I do look forward to her having a vocabulary. Determining a shunt issue on a non verbal infant is a challenge.  My son is the same age, and his malfunction was vomiting once a day, a tiny amount, for a week. We would been told vomiting would be projectile so we did not call anyone. When people tell you malfunction looks different for everyone, I believe it is true. 14 month back my little daughter had a VP malfunction, symptoms was :\n\n1- Projectile vomiting (she vomits violently , cylinders of liquid rushed out of her little mouth ).\n\n2- Extreme distress. (she kept shrinking her body and assuming fetal position)\n\n3- Her eyes lost concentration and moved in circles (occasionally).\n\n4- Noticeable change in behavior in a very short period. (did not respond to the usual stimulation and feeding time became even harder)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was 1 year old at that time. (I have to add that she has an extreme case of  hydrocephalus more than 80% of the brain is fluid, so IDK if she can be taken as a reference) Each experience is unique.  Each story will help us other parents watch out for our kids.  Thank you for sharing.  I hope your girl is doing okay now.   yes indeed, it depends on the situation and the child and many other factors.  \nregarding your question, hmmmm, you can say both, the change in behavior was noticeable few weeks ahead  and vomiting was not consistent(i guess the valve was partially working) , but after re calibrating the valve (by the neurosurgeon) it took few hours to peak all other symptoms (I guess re calibration was it for the valve). Good luck and safety to all parents dealing with this my identical twin brother as a VP shunt we are 22 years old both on the pre Med track and applying to medical school this summer. Let me tell you I cannot say much about infant stages of hydrocephalus but with my experiences being around my brother 24/7 later in life your son or daughter can live a relatively normal life with that being said everyone has different experience but my brother played football, baseball and basketball and all the way into college playing baseball. Anything is possible never give up and keep having faith.

The tube kinked in my abdomen and was creating a pocket of fluid. Is there something I should/should not be doing to prevent this from happening again?

I am so sorry to hear this because it is just one of those freak things. \n\nI had my VP shunt for 5 years until scar tissue formed and that pocket of fluid was created as well.

I also started feeling a sensation in my shunt (in my head) when gently pushing on the incision on my stomach.  That is when I knew something was wrong.  The pain in my brain stem got progressively worse and I went to the ER where they did CT scans and X-rays. Ya I am not having headaches or serious shunt issues that I know of.

I am not a doctor, so grain of salt with this shot in the dark:\n\nI am not sure if you have had hydrocephalus since birth (or how old you are), but there is a tenuous (and not very well established) link between hydrocephalus and a rare disease called primary ciliary dyskinesia. It varies wildly in its presentation + severity, so if you have not had these issues up until now, there is still a chance you could have it (even if you have never had respiratory issues in the past). The main symptoms will include recurrent lower respiratory infections, which will present with lots of coughing, mucus, and asthma-like symptoms. The list of symptoms is actually much longer, but those are the primary respiratory ones, at least. \n\nSource: I have both hydrocephalus + PCD. The PCD Foundation in the US mentions hydrocephalus as an associated disease on its website. Yes, I have had hydro and shunt since I was a baby. My revision was in 2019. I have been feeling this way for a year now. Would definitely see if you can get a consult with a pulmonologist if you continue to experience these symptoms. A family doctor would probably just throw a bronchodilator at you and be done with it, but it sounds like you have something else going on with your symptoms lasting that long. And if it *is* something like PCD, you want to address it ASAP as it is manageable, but can cause permanent lung damage if not addressed.

I am interested in hearing people's stories outside of that group.\n I am part of the FB community to but I have not shared my story with many people on there. I will try to keep it short. I was diagnosed at 16 months, but I was showing symptoms long before that. My parents had at least 2 different doctors deny me a neurosurgeon referal. What got me in was a nurse at a clinic for familys living at or under the poverty line. She noticed me, got our contact info, came over and did some measurements and got me a referal. I have had that same shunt for 30+ years. I had very minimum problems with until about 9 years ago. I have been dealing with at least chronic headaches for most of my adult life, with other symptoms showing up since. Near the beginning I was denied a nsg refferal after ended up going to the er, and I was sent to a neurologist instead. I did eventually go back to seeing my neurosurgeon for a few years. After multiple tests he found that my distal is calcifying, and in my chest area there is a gap where it is not connected. But due to my body being used to my shunt being there it is still draining. According to him I do not have the right symptoms for surgery with main one I am lacking being enlarged ventricles. I eventually flaked out, and stopped going. But I plan on going back soon. I am going to see if anything has changed before getting a 2nd opinion. Also I assume you mean me the hydrocephalus group. But if you add people from those groups I might know you, or have heard of you. Wow! Yea, I am sure your headache will be improved with a fully working shunt. Basically what it comes down to is 3 surgeries my shunt is broken I have 2 surgeon and a neurologist one of my surgeons will not even touch me and my neurologist says It needs to come out. I have not eaten nearly anything in 3 months and I am in an insane amount of pain ", "Stomach Issues and Nausea Okay this is a long one so please bare with me. Two summers ago, I was diagnosed and had surgery to remove a benign brain tumor. The surgery went as expected, and I went back to university with no problems. Flash forward sometime, I am back at school for a week and I get hydracephalus which I mistake for covid. This almost kills me, as my vitals were crashing due to my head swelling my fluid.\n\nFlash forward to the present. For many months, I have been dealing with IBS symptoms like nausea, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, and heartburn. Doctors believe it could be caused by a number of things ... I have gotten an ultrasound, blood drawn, and an endoscope, but Doctors have found nothing. We originally believed it was anxiety relating from stress caused by the hydracephalus. But now it is worse, I do not know what to do. I am on compazine and Zofran and pepcid to help with the nausea ... some days it works, some it does not.\n\nWhat does this sound like?\n\n21M. 6'2. Caucasian. 185 LBS. My one neurosurgeon wants me to get a CT scan of my belly, cause he said its possible that the VP shunt I have is draining into my stomach the wrong way. I am just at a loss, and am tired of feeling nauseous. Sorry to hear about the covid mix up.  Our current state of medicine is in shambles and the individuality and personalized care is being stripped from doctors. It is sounds to me like you maybe overdraining based on your symptoms IF they are positional. Do you have a vp programmable shunt or nonprogrammable. You may need to go up a setting like i have needed before. That was a thought. I have a VP shunt. \n\nI got a CT scan and everything came back normal. My neurosurgeon possibly recommended a CT of my abdomen ... how would that be different from getting an ultrasound which I already got? Is your shunt programmable? Yes. I would assume you have a VP shunt. It does not actually drain into your stomach. It drains into the a body cavity. That cavity then absorbs the excess CSF. There are other options if the VP shunt is not functioning right for you. Blood draw and endoscopy are not going to be able to see the catheter and an ultra sound technician could miss it, especially if it is not barium coated tubing. An abdominal CT Scan will give them a much better picture of what the tubing is doing and should give the doctor useable information. Whenever my daughter has her \u201cshunt series\u201d done they ALWAYS do a CT If not an MRI. Overdraining might cause the nausea, but it would likely be accompanied by other hydrocephalus symptoms - ie headache, sensitivity to light, all that good stuff. If not that, maybe the way your body is reacting to the CSF draining from your VP shunt would be my guess. \nI have a degree in my personal experience though so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nBest of luck figuring this shit out. I know it is not conventional, but I have found small amounts of cannabis to help quite a bit with the nausea. Avoid concentrates like carts and that junk, as it does not focus on containing the full spectrum of cbd in the plant, and blasts you to oblivion with psychoactive thc, which can make nausea worse. \nHang tough amigo! There is light at the end of the tunnel I talked to someone else and they said its possible I could be under shunted, would not that be the opposite?\n\nMy main symptoms are getting nauseous when im not laying down. Both under drainage and over drainage have the same symptoms - just one is fatal and the other one is uncomfortable. \n\nDo you ever experience relief from the symptoms? Yes when I am laying down", "Hydrocephalus and wisdom teeth Can a wisdom tooth cause pain and pressure around the area of your VP shunt? Just curious because a wisdom tooth just started coming through and I keep getting a painful pressure feeling around the area of my shunt I believe it can \nWhen I have high pressure I get jaw pain really bad so theRe must be some relationship there Yes, so long story short I have had my shunt for 5 years but I am terrified of the dentist so I never got my bottom wisdom teeth out. Lo and behold 3 weeks ago I get a monster headache like high pressure feeling headache so of course I freak out call my doctor and he orders an mri. Well the day before one of the wisdom teeth cracks and the headaches have been on and off since. No issues with the shunt at all and turns out my wisdom teeth have been causing it the entire time! Do not be me and get them pulled lol 2 more weeks left for me to enjoy this Yes, it is likely referred pain. Still worth checking out with your doctors if you are having consistent pain. Entirely possible. I did not have that specifically before getting my wisdom teeth out but would occasionally get shunt-area pain from teeth grinding, so it seems pretty plausible they would potentially cause that issue as they grow out (or whatever it is they end up doing).", "Recovery from Dementia-Like Symptoms? Hi there, I hope you might be able to offer me some comfort or advice.\n\nMy dad had several major brain injuries last year, and was seriously ill. By some medical miracle, he recovered well enough with some minor short-term memory loss. He was doing really really well up until about two months ago or so when he started getting very confused, and forgetful, referring to conversations and people that simply were not there. A couple of times he tried to go to work (he retired three years ago). At first my mum assumed my dad starting to show dementia symptoms, but his decline was so fast, that this did not make sense. It turns out following referral to his neurosurgeon and a subsequent CT scan, that he has hydrocephalus. I did not know this, but it is apparently a common complication following a head injury.\n\nThat was two weeks ago. He is had his shunt fitted today, and is recovering in ICU. Obviously we are hoping for full recovery from the surgery, but in the last couple of weeks the dementia symptoms that he had started to show had got extreme and I am wondering if anybody else experienced this and if so what their experience of recovery was like did you recover in full or do you still have occasional confusion and delirium? If you did recover, can you remember anything leading up to the shunt being fitted? \n\nI know everybody\u2019s experience of this sort of thing is different, (and I know there are no easy answers) but I do not want to google this in case I find horror stories. I am trying to be as positive as possible without expecting miracles. \n\n(I am not sure if it matters or it makes a difference but I am based in the UK my parents are based in Portugal) I am sure after a recovering period you will see a world of difference. Getting the shunt place will of course make things 100% better for him. After a recovery period (6 wks or sooner) you will probably notice that he will be pretty much back to normal. Having a head injury was the reason for the Hydrocephalus to present, the doctors have now \"fixed\" that issue so things should go back to normal for him. Oh I do hope so! Part of me is worried that we had one miracle, why should we get lucky again? \n\nThank you so much for reassuring me. I have really missed \u2018my\u2019 dad these last couple of months. No problem. This issue is basically fixed now I am sure that he will be able to go about his life pretty much the way he wants save for a few appointments in the near future and then probably once a year after that.\n   Just make sure that he keeps the appointments that are scheduled for him in the future. Many people undergo surgery as your dad has and go on to lead full lives without complications.\nGood luck! I get dementia like symptoms every time the pressure gets bad (I have had over 200 shunt revisions so it is happened a few times, do not worry, this is unlikely for your dad). It gets better with recovery time. There are things that can help though. Ask for a referral to a neurophysio and an occupational therapist. He needs to push himself to do things that are difficult (even just talking) but not to the point of exhaustion.", "Second dose of COVID-19 vaccine I got my first dose of Pfizer on April 27th. I am 28 years old.\n\nHas anyone had any experience with getting the second dose of Pfizer?\n\nCan you tell me if you experienced any major side effects from getting the second dose.\n\nMy mother is telling me to wait until she says it is safe to get the second dose of the shot but I am not sure how much waiting she is planning on doing before telling me when it is considered safe to get it.\n\nI already scheduled the second dose of Pfizer for May 18th.\n\nDo I go ahead and get the second dose of the shot? Have not heard of anyone having extra csf from the shot, not sure what your mom is waiting for to deem it safe enough for you to get the second\nOf course if you feel like you are having shunt probs go to hospital but I do not think the vaccine will case them I did not experience any major side effects from the first dose besides a sore arm.

I have hydrocephalus she does not. I am 51 years old VP Shunt here. Getting my second shot tomorrow and can let you know. First one did not have much of anything. \n\nI can say that I did start getting weekly allergy shots a year ago, and those take the energy out of me every time, but I think that is more \"we are shoving 50 things you are allergic to inside your body deal with it\". Can you let me know how it goes. \n29 yo male, hydrocephalus and shunt since 1 yo here. Got my Moderna part 2 yesterday. Sore arm and some mild feverish feelings but overall not as bad as I expected.\n\nIf you wait to get the second dose for too long you will have to get the first dose again and start over. \n\nLots of people talking about waiting to see what happens do not seem to realize that while this vaccine happened relatively(ish) quickly, Coronavirus as a general type of virus is not new and COVID-19 has similarities to SARS. Also, because it became a global pandemic, the worst one in almost 100 years, every developed nation on the planet worked towards a vaccine for this virus all at the same time so of course it got done quickly. I am going to get the second dose anyway regardless of what my mom's opinion and beliefs on it are. I cannot convince her to change her mind and get it. Good on you and thanks for not being on the side that will delay the world getting to normal again. I am 27, have a vp shunt, and got the 2nd dose of Pfizer last week. My only side effect was an achey arm. Did you contract a major fever or headache if at all? Nope, absolutely no fever, no headache, nothing. Literally my only side effect was an achey upper arm, which lasted 2 days at most. I have tried reasoning with my mother but honestly, it is pointless to try. Get it as recommended. Do not wait for your mom's permission. Receiveth t as recommend'd.  Wait not f'r thy mother's permission\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` My daughter got both shots no issues except for a little flu like symptoms..\nBut, if you are not comfortable,wait, its your choice I  am about two and a half weeks past dose two, biggest issue both times was just a basic injection site soreness, good otherwise. Unless your mom has relevant knowledge, she should not be advising you against completing the vaccine course. Even if she does have knowledge, it is a huge conflict of interest for her to be going against what professionals in Covid research have been saying. There is no reason to assume we need any sort of special approach to these new vaccines. Just get it like you are supposed to so you are properly immunized. The first shot is a primer, if you wait too long or do not get it at all your immunity is jeopardized.\n\nPersonally I got the moderna vaccine, both doses, and am doing fine. Second dose put me out for 24 hours, but it is worth it. Did you check with your doctor first before getting the second dose? No, because there is not any reason to ask my doctor about it.  \n\n\"No disease or disorder, including **hydrocephalus** or having a shunt, has been documented to increase the risk of adverse reactions to the **vaccine**(s)\"\n\nfrom ( How do I go about easing my mom\u2019s worries about the symptoms of the second dose of the vaccine? She will end up asking me about it. You can show her the Hydrocephalus Association web site that I linked to. They are the premier source of hydrocephalus information. \n\nBut if your mom is anything like my mom, it does not matter, she is made up her mind and it is basically impossible to ease her worries. Anything contrary, no mater how based off totally reasonable logic and scientific data it is, is the ultimate betrayal. Luckily I am married and I do not have to constantly worry about living up to every minute expectation of my mother anymore. Yup. Got it around two pm est. Mostly just sleepy more than anything.

Problem is that I am not sure if it is a side effect of the hydrocephalus or my age. :)\n\nBest thing you can do is roll with it.

My short term memory is about as valuable as a piece of shit Have you got a shunt? 3, actually. I tend to not remember things people tell me. They will tell me to go get something, and I will always forget what it was. Because of this, I started carrying a notepad and pen.

I had one done 3 years ago, they shave a really small piece of hair (1\u201d square maybe) right next to my part (centre part) and the hair was growing back within a week and I could hid the regrowth easily by parting my hair on the side \nI have also been told my hair grows quickly? So that might have helped me too \n\n\n\n\nHorrible pics but you can see the small area that was shaved (does not help that I almost never take selfies of my left lol) I would wait and see how it looks post op before shaving your head. You can always cut more off.  I have a tumour in one of my ventricles.   Doctors put in a shunt when I was 10, now I am 38.  \n\nI am now just learning about the procedure you are about to have and it sounds promising, wish I had this option in 1989.  \n\nDo not fret too much about your hair, you can make a decision later and decide how to manage it.  Deal with it afterwards, focus entirely on the situation: that you have a tumour but thankfully you live in a place where brain surgery is attainable. My daughter had this same procedure done when she was 6 months old. The area of hair shaved was about a 1 inch by 1 inch squares. She was six months old when she had the procedure done and even at 6 months my wife was able to just about cover the area with her hair. Good luck with the procedure and hope everything goes well for you Yeah, unless you go to some really old-fashioned doctor, they usually pin your hair up and shave a tiny bit of it. Do not shave your head! Last revision I had I shaved mine and was royally chewed out by my neurosurgeon in pre-op. He told me that it was a huge infection risk if I had nicked my scalp. Great idea! Thank you. Mine is a pilocytic astrocytoma so hoping once hydrocephalus is resolved I can start trying for a baby again. Wow ok! Roger that and thanks for the tip! Thank you so much. It sounds so vapid but sometimes keeping a bit of normality helps.  So glad your little girls is well! Did anyone notice that they felt better after the procedure and reduction of pressure? yeah, my daughter had it done 18 months ago, and it was only a tiny patch. She had it redone 2 weeks ago because the holes had partially closed. However, since then, the change has been remarkable. I am so happy to hear that! I had ETV three weeks ago, oddly enough.  I had a shunt for 12 years, but after one failure the doctors decided to put in the ETV.  In my case, I had a bit shaved off my temple on one side, and some shaved off in the back (one incision for the camera, one for the ventriculostomy tool).  About 1 sq. in. in front and 2 sq. in. in the back.  Not bad, plus it grows very fast!  Also, depending on your hairline, they might not have to do much cutting at all.  I benefitted from that for sure. Did you feel better afterwards? Or no real change? Mine was done because of a brain bleed so I felt better right way Yes. But it took a surprisingly long time to slowly improve after the shock of the surgery, which was my first brain surgery. Thunderclap headaches resolved immediately and balance has been mostly restored after almost 1 year. My mother had this procedure and the area shaved was quite small so she could just part her hair to cover it up. But as someone (female who was 20 at the time) who shaved my head during a bad period of depression, I embraced a shaved head and rocked it.

Left side. Has anyone experienced this? Do you have allergies? There are quite a few sinuses on the front of your face. I do have allergies and allergy induced asthma. \nI always just have a worry when any part of my head hurts because I do have a VP shunt. The ache starts nearby my shunt and travels down to my eye. It is hard to explain, but it is like random pulse pains. It is not a continuous headache. I started to get eye pain before and my neurologist made me see an ophthalmologist because there was a chance that my fluid pressure was getting too high. Check with your doctors and let them know.", "Has anyone had an ETV as an adult, after having a shunt that stopped working? I have had shunts since I was a kid, and a couple revisions. The first shunt lasted me 10 years, and second lasted me 11. I had surgery recently and it quickly became partially blocked. My ventricles were slit like over the course of the 11 years I had the second shunt, and they only did surgery because they got a little bigger; though they were still small. With my new shunt, my ventricles are normal and have not increased in size, so I am not sure if they just are not expanding, or if there is some drainage. My doctor has given me the option of ETV or shunt, and I really would like to get the ETV done, because it does seem safer and with less risks. Though I am curious if anyone on here has had an ETV as an adult after having a shunt... they said they would do the ETV on me and then keep the old shunt in so that in the event of a ETV failure they can turn the shunt back on. What was your experience? Any side effects? There is someone on here that gave me advice a few months ago about this. Her son had it done. I am sure if she sees this, she will most likely answer, but if she does not maybe you could find the comment she left for me. It was a pretty detailed comment about her son, and I appreciated it a great deal. That is me! I have had 6 shunts, altered over 7 surgeries, and this summer had a shunt blockage early in the am while recovering from a shunt procedure in hospital (I am 24). Due to the timing, resources available, and surgeon on duty, they decided to go with ETV. It is definitely different compared to a shunt, the brain needs to readjust to everything I guess. I did have memory issues at first but they said it is normal and will improve in time. Other than that no. Surgeon told me after my MRI to have a nice life :) if you have other questions let me know! Thanks for the reply, how did you feel after surgery in terms of pain? Every time I have had a revision I feel pretty good since the pressure is relieved, hoping it is similar. Overall was the recovery time pretty quick? My shunt recovery was pretty quick most of the time. Also, how long did you stay in the hospital after surgery? I honestly do not remember any pain at all, but that might also be where it was the eighth major surgery I have had and i have adapted to the pain. Recovery took its time, but I was back to normal after maybe 6 weeks, so longer than the shunt. I was in hospital for 1 week I believe. Mind you, all this is in Canada where healthcare is a bit more relaxed in pace and a little less innovative than in private systems, so it will depend. I was first shunted at 7 weeks old. By the time I was 14 I had a total of 11 shunt related surgeries. I then had a wonderful 20 year gap with no issues. When I got a shunt blockage in my 30s they did a ETV. My scans said the ETV worked, but my headache said differently. I was re-shunted two months after the ETV. The shunt worked and the headaches went away. The new shunt is on the left side. They did remove the old shunt on the right side. I was told there was no medical reason to remove it. It sometimes gets itchy (scar tissue I assume), but I will deal with it if it means no surgery. My new shunt will turn 9 next month. Good Luck! Nice, thanks for the reply! What kind of shunt did you have put in? I am having the same shunt put in place of my blocked one but with an anti siphon device, hopefully that helps. No anti siphon device, but I had one of those put in my old shunt when I was a teenager. I now have a programmable shunt. I think the brand is Medtronic, but do not quote me on that. My shunt actually turned 9 earlier this month. My last revision repositioned the shunt to end near my ribs instead of the abdomen. There is too my abdominal scar tissue that a large cyst formed.", "Massages If you got a massage, would you tell your massage therapist to avoid your tubing? Would you tell them to avoid your neck generally, just that side, or tell them it was no problem? This question could also apply to chiropractors.  I would never EVER let a chiropractor near my neck, whether I had a shunt or not. With the shunt, that is an even bigger no from me.\n\nMassage people? Depending on how gentle they were, and what I needed, I think I would let them know something was there and maybe explain it as needed.

It is been fine the whole year but recently I have been experiencing headaches, fatigue and my shunt makes a clicking noise whenever I close my jaw (bite). Has anyone had this before?

The Medtronic does have a terrible valve, so you may be feeling/hearing that? Maybe", "What was your, \"somethings not right\" moment I was not diagnosed with hydrocephalus until I was 17. When I was 15 I had some weird symptoms but even after some dr visits (ent and pediatrician) nothing came of it. \n\nI am sure people here are aware of how, for some of us, things get worse so slowly so it is hard to really know how bad it is gotten until \"that\" moment. \n\nFor me I was listening to music in headphones and it was a song with heavy stereo mixing where they throw some instruments isolated on the right channel and some isolated on the left channel, and this one day, some instruments were missing from the music. I realized the right channel was extremely muffled, almost dead.  I switched sides of the headphones and realized it was not a headphone issue but an ear issue.  \n\nI had other strange symptoms before but that was the thing that really got the ball rolling and through some miracles I got in quick to see a neurologist and neuro surgeon and had etv surgery a few weeks later. Now I am in my 30s and though some of my hearing in that ear came back it is still pretty muffled. \n\nI want to hear from others what your moment was. \n\nI also want to say if you are young that you can do this. You can make a life for yourself. You can carve your own path. Do not compare yourself to others. Be a good person and just try, it will get you far enough. Mine was when i had a seizure for the first time and not understanding what it was as i never had one even before or after shunt placement. Turns out the cath was blocked and poking my brain. Mine was when I fell when I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. I had other symptoms for about five years which some doctors dismissed (memory) as normal aging. Has your ETV held up? I had a few MRIs yesterday and see my neuro tomorrow to find out if I am a candidate for ETV. 16 years after surgery and still good.

Do not compare yourself to others. Be a good person and just try, it will get you far enough.\n\nWell said. Thanks for sharing your story!\n\nMy dad was diagnosed with hydrocephalus in 2019. I had no idea what hydrocephalus was. When I did more and more research, I saw how many people have it whether it was from birth or developed as they got older. My dad has a brain tumor so that started causing a bunch of things. After some scans, they said something was enlarged. We then noticed he started losing his balance, he could not make it to the washroom on time and he was forgetting and getting very confused. It was scary to see. I felt like I was losing my dad because I knew this is not him. He had his shunt surgery in February of this year (was supposed to be last year but COVID delayed everything!). It was incredible to see he could walk in a straight line and not fall over right after the surgery. Lol no idea i was 2 xD Before my last insertion I would had a run of gnarly headaches over the course of a couple months, some that required an ER run to check things out - but everything 'appeared normal' on scans at the time. Then one day I woke up thinking 'ok, it is going to be a rough day' and took things easy... a few hours later my parents went out for groceries and when they came back I was laying on the couch basically unable to stand up.  A week in my local small town hospital while we got in touch with my NS in the city nearby and waited for a bed to open up down there, then 2 weeks in the city hospital, new shunt addition included. My wardmates in the city were a gunshot victim and a bike wreck survivor, that kind of re-framed my 'oh, it is just a bad headache' view. Mine was 2 weeks ago, I have had my shunt for 20 years and was super tired and finally my mom drug me to the hospital. Turns out the the shunt finally failed. 2 surgeries later and I am at home recovering. Sucks bc now every little yawn or pain in question it For my parents, it was Halloween. I was 7 months old at the time, and I had been failing to meet the major milestones one would expect of an infant. They knew something was wrong, but I think they were still in denial about it being anything more than me just being a late bloomer. That was until Halloween when my aunt, having seen a decent number of infants in her life, said something to the effect of \"You know, his head's awfully big\". I had a CAT scan three weeks later and my first (and so far only) shunt surgery the following morning. To this day, my parents still credit her as the valuable outside perspective that got them to look for answers. It is pretty amazing how quick things can improve after these surgeries.  It is serious, but luckily our brains are away from the heavy movement and stabilizing muscles, so many people are right back to it within a few days. Common surgeries like hernia repair on the other hand... maybe not so serious but man that one knocked me on my ass. I was 6 months old and in the hospital already for spinal meningitis. Thankfully, both got taken care of quickly.\n\nIn the past, for when my shunt has broken, god-awful headaches that are only sorta blunted by a lot of caffeine and Excedrin (migraine med) are my cue that something has gone awry.\n\nFor my most recent shunt breakage this past year (had surgery in April 2021), it was that every time I stood up, I got a searing pain in the back of my head that kept me from moving or opening my eyes anywhere from 5-30 seconds each time I stood up. Unfortunately, all the tests came back negative, so it took until I almost died to get someone is attention enough to get it figured out + fixed. (We never really got a good explanation of why all the usual diagnostic tests were negative, but we did them several times and they never told us anything.)  Thanks for the great news! I do have obstructive hydrocephalus so if I need surgery ETV is the procedure. For me, like you said, symptoms just started building over the course of roughly 10 years. Started off with pressure behind the eyes and back of my head. Then came the headaches, dizziness, nausea, then eventually I started sleeping lots and having vision issues. One day while at work I was nearly passing out so I finished the rest of my shift and went straight to the hospital. Turns out my shunt had dislocated from the tube that goes to my abdomen and the only thing that kept it draining was there is so much scar tissue build up around where the shunt dislocated from the tube. Doc said I was lucky I came in when i did. Having surgery sometime this month and will be my first surgery since the shunt and all its hardware was first installed 23 years ago.", "Hey Everyone, New to This So, I have had headaches off and on all my life, when them being more often maybe 10 years ago (often as in a few migraines a year).\n\nFast forward to April this year, and I had a pretty bad headache that was not going away on my left side. The pain and side effects being unlike my previous migraines, an MRI was scheduled\n\n\"You have excess fluid around your brain, you will need surgery\"\n\nThat is where things started as I finished my MRI. The pain I was feeling from the headaches was also leading to high blood pressure; for the first time in my life.\n\nAfter a day in the hospital, I spoke with a Nerologist who did a complete exam full of Q&amp;A, cognitive testing and motor skills. Everything was \"very good\" and follow up would be needed for a Cisternogram. Once we figured out the right meds to bring my BP down, I went home, managing pain with Tylenol.\n\nOver the next week, I had a LP and follow up images as part of the Cisternogram. The results? \"There is no blockage of fluid in your spine or your brain.\n\nThat was that. Within 1.5 weeks, I went from \"you have excess fluid in your brain and need surgery\" to \"we are happy with what we see at this time, no further action is needed.\"\n\nCurrently, headaches are the only side effect I am having from this. I can go 24-36 hours without a headache, but most of the time, I have to take 2-6 Tylenol 500mg within a 24 hr period to keep the headaches back. My primary care physician says that with basic over the counter pain medication working against the headaches without being in excess, there is no worries at this time since there are no other symptoms.\n\nThe headaches come fast. I keep Tylenol in the house, in my car and if I am going to be away from both, physically on me. The moment I feel pain in my left forehead or close to my left eye, I have to take something. If I do not, that bad boy it is a 5-6 on a scale of 10 within a good 5-10 minutes. Tylenol eventually kicks in within 20-30 minutes if I do end up taking it too late.\n\nI have looked at various posts in here, and many of you are post-surgery. Did anyone go through this type of \"holding pattern\" when they were first diagnosed, if as an adult? I have been told that the side effects of hydrocephalus is not limited to problems controlling my bladder, dizziness, memory and other cognitive issues that are similar to dementia. \n\nI trust my PCP and the Neurologist when they say everything looks good and no further action is needed. However, I cannot help but wonder what the next \"stage\" of problem/resolution is going to be. Get a second opinion. You clearly have doubts about your symptoms, you should clear them up. I just wanted to add that I had a non programmable vp shunt for 35 out of my 36 years of life. Well last year it failed and they ended up removing it and giving me 2 programmable shunts.\n\nNow, I get many more headaches than I ever did before (not daily but probably weekly) the doctors tell me even though I am a year post op this is a is normal and there is nothing wrong with my scans.\n\nSo the only thing I can do is pop an advil and grin and bear the pain. For me, napping when possible helps. I am working on this, but getting a fight from the insurance company, which paid a ton of money already for my time and procedure this spring.. You poor thing, sounds like you do not need all this confusion along with the dreadful headaches. Is there any way to get a second opinion? Have you actually seen the MRI's which show the fluid? I am working on trying to get a second opinion, in addition to talking with my current Neurologist. I have seen the MRI and the excess fluid. I was also shown a CT from about 12 years ago which showed a slightly excess fluid on the same side, but it was not cause for concern by the ER Dr at that time. Hope you get that second opinion soon. Something has triggered the headaches. Just a thought - have you had an eye check up lately? Yes, it was one of the things I had done at the hospital. My left optic nerve showed some swelling, but a follow up showed none, so they are chalking that up to it being impacted by the other swelling going on in general. Absolutely demand another opinion and tell them about this. I wish you all the best - please keep.in touch if you want support - this sub is great.", "Can u relate? What did you do? So I have been trouble with the feeling of syncope similar to the feeling I had when I had my seizure which resulted in my 6th surgery. I get light headed weak and everything gets blurry and I cannot breathe. It is been getting worse and I try to fight it. I have an appointment with my surgeon on the 15th but I do not know how I can control it or what to do. I had a really bad headache the other day that lasted 2 days and all I did was sleep. I did not go to school or physical therapy and it was horrible. \n\nShould I be more worried?", "How do you deal with a Neurosurgeon that thinks nothing is wrong? ", "Should I be worried about my shunt? So, I am an 18 year old female who has had a shunt since infancy (I had head trauma during birth) and so I have a VP shunt that drains fluid into my abdomen. Recently, I have noticed that my shunt has a kink in it. I do not know if it is twisted or something, but it hurts if I move my neck a certain way. Today I woke up with what I thought was the flu. I had trouble waking up and have noticed changes in my sleeping patterns. I have been noticing that my vision is blurred. I have shooting pains in my shunt, and a mild fever/headache that is worse on the side that the shunt is on. I am also very drowsy and have a hard time paying attention to things. \n\nI have only had two incidents where my shunt was infected or having problems in my life (once when I was 4, and again when I was around 13). I may just be paranoid, but I thought I would check before deciding to do something about it. I have been told that my shunt is not really doing work anymore because the problem is fixed, but the kink in my shunt is making me a bit nervous.  Those are definitely symptoms I would get checked out by a neurosurgeon. I would go get checked out by your NS. Better get it checked out. Call your neurosurgeon now and if they cannot get you in asap probably go to the er. It is better to be safe with your health.  I think being an 18 year old shunt, it would be hard for it to kink. I would bet it is more likely calcified and something is going on externally that makes it feel like the shunt is kinked. By now, your body would have grown in around the shunt well enough that it could not move freely like it would need to be able to do if it were going to kink.   \n\n\nI am still on team get it checked out, but I am not sure it is going to be a kink like you are imagining. Hope it all checks out for you.  Yeah, I figured it would not be much, but I like to be cautious. I am overdue for a checkup with my neurosurgeon anyways, so it will probably be good to go get it checked. When I was 18, my neuro released me unless I felt like something needed addressed. I have survived well in the ER since then.  I suffered with symptoms like that for a year and just took Excedrin migraine but went to get it checked out few weeks ago and yep my shunt was broken and had to get surgery.  The reason I let it go so long is because the local doctor just said oh try and get better sleep, give up coffee etc and the migraines should stop. I am still recovering but definitely do not make the mistake of suffering long like I did.  My shunt was 29 years old and broke at the base of my neck.  \nDid you have headaches? Vision issues? I had a seizure last month (epileptic since 2015) and im having some fatigue/difficulty sleeping since then but its not getting worse, wondering if the seizure could have broken or blocked the shunt but i didnt hit my head or anything  My vision did get worse.  I was already pretty bad off with vision from my hydrocephalus due to pressure on the optic nerve I was left with 20/80 vision which did seem to get a little worse with the headaches.  My vision is still worse after the surgery though too.  I hope it just takes time to recover but it is been 2 weeks since my surgery.", "Shunts &amp; Disability My fiance had a brain tumor at birth and had her first shunt placed at 11months after they removed it. She had a revision at age 12 (2005) and then it failed in 2018. They initially revised it but then determined it broke so they did a full replacement (she had 3 surgeries in 2 weeks). \n\nWhile her shunt is functioning well and she had little to no adverse effects, her memory still is not great and more importantly, she is extremely worried about it failing again. She has not worked since the last surgery and is afraid to find a new job because of her memory problems and her constant worrying about the shunt having to be replaced/revised again. \n\nWhile I can support our household, we live paycheck to paycheck without her income.

My son is 4 months old and got a shunt about 3 weeks ago. He is doing great, but my wife and I have been wondering about travel insurance. We are not planning any trips yet, but want to understand limitations or potential costs. We will obviously reach to some insurance agencies but wanted to check here first to see if anyone had any thoughts? I do not really know what travelers insurance does, but whenever my family travels we scout out the neurosurgeons ahead of time. Usually it is as simple as asking our surgeon if he knows anyone in the city we are going too. I am an adult with a shunt and I always use AllClear. They cover preexisting medical conditions and are not too unreasonably priced :) Typically, even if the provider is out of network, if it is an emergency, your insurance will pay the in network level- even if your out of the country Careful.  Pre existing medical conditions can cause your claim to be rejected. \n\n  Took me almost 5 years to find a life insurance provider who is willing to give me full coverage of $1 million. All others wanted to have me agree to their shady policies or rejected me out right.  The best policy to ask a ton of questions upfront and if they agree and you agree then you are fully covered If you are traveling internationally,  its a good idea to get insurance even without  preexisting condition.

He was diagnosed at age 15, I believe. When we first started dating, I assured him that I would not judge him for his condition (and I did not). But I did educate myself about it because I thought it would benefit our relationship. I had my own issues, too. (Epilepsy, anxiety, depression, learning disabilities, etc.). So I empathized!\n\nBut after we broke up in August, I started overanalyzing our ENTIRE relationship. There were many times when my bf was very kind and empathetic. But then there were also many times when he would get irritated, extremely anxious, and very insensitive. Now I am wondering...could any of that be attributed to his condition, or could most of it just be part of his personality? This was (and still is) driving me crazy!\n\nLast night, my ex told me that most people would not want to date someone in my position (unemployed and unable to drive) because they would think the person \"needs help.\" That really, really hurt me! He crossed the line with his comment! :( So to cope, I am trying to tell myself that part of his lack of a filter is due to his condition. I need to move on, but this is so f\\*\\*\\*ing hard!

Diagnosed about a year ago, do not have a shunt. \n\nI have used glasses all my life, putting them on in the morning and taking them off only before going to sleep. I never made the connection between glasses and headaches, but a few months ago I made the mistake of buying new metal glasses, which at first seemed to be way too tight. After several adjustments made by an optician, they became bearable to wear, but I still find them quite uncomfortable if worn for longer periods of time. \n\nLately, I have been experiencing worse-than-usual headaches and was wondering if they could be related to glasses as I have not made any other lifestyle changes. Your prescription could be incorrect, if my glasses are not right I get headaches. If you get to see an optician there is the added benefit that they can take a look at your eyes to check for papilledema...but if you are really concerned it is something to see your neurosurgeon/emergency department about. yes the wrong prescription can cause headaches.

It was hockey and basketball that they made me stop and I took up netball. I started volleyball without telling them when I started highschool. I was bored of not playing team sports haha. I had played tennis throughout as well which I had forgotten about. Yeah I have stents now. I had about 200 surgeries and then it was decided it was not working for me so we have tried stents. So far so good! Three years with no surgeries is the longest I have ever gone. My record before was the 13 months before my first surgery as a baby haha. That is very cool.  I am older now and my job is still pretty physical. So I am kind of active. I used to play paintball.  I had a special piece of plastic to cover my shunt so it would not get hit.

I had to go bc there was a lump at the valve on my neck and it concerned my mum so we got it checked out and from an ultrasound we found out that the shunt had migrated and is now no longer in my stomach but in my xiphisternum and the dr said that my tissues made a pathway for the fluid and that is why I have not experienced any problems despite the shunt being misplaced/ migrated. Arrested does not mean \"healed\". It basically means you have not been showing symptoms of hydro for a while. I have only come across a very few cases of arrested hydro for a prolonged period of time. Your vents have most likely adjusted to a new \"normal\". You were most likely over-draining. My background: 5 revisions, shunt placed at age 2 for big cyst in left hemisphere of brain. Last surgery 2017\n\nIn re: to your brain adjusting to the pressure, it could def be a possibility. It all depends on how your brain is honestly. I know my shunt will never be retired lol\n\nThis has occurred to me twice. My first failure - my god I felt like I was dying for five years straight. That is how I know my shunt was clogged or was not properly working. \n\nI was in a car accident in Feb 2017 and took a bit of whiplash. I automatically reached for my shunt in and felt it disconnected in my neck. I originally had a tiny headache going to the ER, but it then went away....\n\nugh...however months later November 2017 I woke up from a nap and i could feel a good bit of fluid buildup under the skin right where the shunt broke. Then hours later, the worst headache of my life and I had to wait a day for it to get replaced \n\nAnother thing: You may get \u201ctiny\u201d headaches related to allergies, dehydration, melatonin, etc. shunt headaches (Atleast mine are BRUTAL) I legit cannot even get out of bed to brush my teeth\n\nIn short, how my shunt has done in my life\n- CT Scans do not do shit at showing anything about my shunt or how it is working\n- spinal or shunt taps do not do anything either, hurt way more than the beneficial results they give me\n- ICP monitors - never again\n- whenever I feel a break in my shunt, I really need to contemplate a replacement because if I do not have a shunt headache then, I may get a \u201cdelayed clog/failure\u201d at a more inconvenient time\u201d\n- I realized i will always need my shunt. It is either I make too much ICP, the draining is off (without the shunt) or my Chiari has some effect\n- lastly - Fentenyl is the only pain reliever that helps my shunt headaches, and you def cannot get that at CVS The worst for me was ages 14-18 honestly. Not as bad anymore.", "Our first year with a baby with Hydrocephalus  When I was 20 weeks pregnant I found out our baby would be born with hydrocephalus.  It was so tough.  I wish there were more blogs about babies and hydrocephalus.  I wrote this for future parents who find out their baby has hydrocephalus...also, it is a little NSFW because of surgery/birth pics. Just a heads up, your images are not loading. I can just pop on tinybeans though since I have a very similar story.  Thank you for letting me know.  I THINK I fixed the pictures.  Would you mind trying it again and letting me know if the pictures work now?\n They work!  You are the best! Thank you so much! I am glad your little one is doing so well. We also frequent the clinic main campus.  If you dont mind me asking. Who did your surgery? I love all the doctors and nurses in peds and NICU  Sorry for the slow reply, I just saw this! Our son has been with Dr. Onwazilike (Dr. O) since birth.  You?  We also have Dr. O. He and jeff are the best! She was diagnosed at 2 weeks and been with them ever since OH MY GOSH RIGHT!!?  I  cannot say enough nice things about Jeff!  He really spends extra time with our little guy and asks lots of questions and is always quick to respond when I call upset about things!  We have been with Dr. O and Jeff since before JJ was born (we found out he had Hydrocephalus at 20 weeks in utero)  Could not ask for better doctors/PAs!!! If you ever want to meetup for lunch with your spouse and daughter, it would be nice to meet another family who is dealt with hydrocephalus! I will definitely mention it to my wife. I just started joking this sub and facebook groups. We missed the walk by like 3 days", "Does anyone feel like a burden to others? I have bad eyesight due to my hydrocephalus causing so much pressure causing my eyes to twitch, and I just feel bad for needing so much support from other people and being a burden on my parents due to my condition. Anyone else? I am a parent of a 6 year old with hydrocephalus who has cortical vision impairment. I would never want her to think she is a burden! Your family loves you. You are not a burden. We all have our stuff! xoxo This exactly.. my son is almost 2, also has cvi and cerebral palsy and he is amazing! I do sometimes. I am only 13 but I feel like I worry my friends too much. My dad is starting to have issues with eyesight (NPH). Burden is not a word that comes to mind. I wish I could give him my own eye if I could....\n\nI am sure your family feels the same about you", "Are revisions any more safe nowadays? How many have you had? I have had hydro since birth, revised at age 11 and again at age 21. My most recent revision was 4.5 months ago, and my catheter has been partially blocked for a couple months now, my surgeon just thought it was on the wrong setting for a while before saying he thinks it is partially blocked. I went through a revision this past October and it went very well, hopefully that is indicative of future surgical outcomes. \n\nTrying to find info online, it is pretty scary, some state mortality rate of revision is as high as 6% while others say it is near 0.2%. The possibility of dying and other serious complications really make it so scary and hard though I find reading about how many surgeries some have had is comforting, knowing they came out of surgery fine, more operations than I have had. My ventricles do not get big these days, and while they did increase a little over my most recent blockage, they still are slightly smaller than normal. Scans look normal, but I know it is blocked due to the 24/7 headache I had for so many years with a previous blockage.\n\nHow many operations / revisions have you had? Any complications? \n\nI am having surgery in March at one of the top hospitals in the country (us)  to replace the blocked proximal catheter and my surgeon hopes moving it will prevent blockage, hopefully that works. What really scares me is the possibility of dying, or a serious infection. Reading about people have 30+ surgeries does make it more comforting. I have had 7 revisions, though the last was an ETV. I never even thought of safety because the surgeons where I am were so confident with it and could do the procedure quite easily. The recovery and all that was never fun but it never seemed too critical when looking at the surgery itself. I have had 23 revisions not counting the initial placement for the original VP shunt in 1984 when I was 30 yrs old. I was born with Hydrocephalus but due to the fact I did not have the \"classic\" symptoms and enlarged head of a baby born in 1954, the symptoms were not diagnosed properly until the CT-can technology came into play.  In 2001 I have 21 revisions by a Chief Neurosurgeon in a MAJOR hospital in the US. It was decided that a Programmable Shunt (Codman Hickman) was needed. Prior to ALL these surgeries the Dr. said he was not sure what symptoms he could stop or lessen....and the surgeries were actually no help at all.\n\nI have had serious headaches every day and vomiting issues that require Zofran (IV) 4 times a day. Yet, the \"new\" Neurosurgeon I have \"claims\" my CT-scan look great. Really? You have serious headaches for 19 yrs and you have improved CT-scans?  Personally I think this is bull-sh\\*t due to the HUGE garbage due to the OPIATE crisis. I do not care if you are having a serious headache where you are vomiting constantly in front of an ER doctor, They WILL not help you any more.\n\nAs far as your fear of dying or other issues....I find this relevant of course, but a little strange. Most people do not die due to these surgeries, you have to decide if it is WORTH whatever issues you are now going through if you are told you need a revision. Most of these surgeries are done with little issues. I agree with the commenter PheeltheThunder, recovery is not that much fun, but if you feel you need the surgery, I would not put it off simply because what you go through on a daily basis prior to surgery. It is something that you have to decide for yourself. Agree with what is been commented on already just chiming in to support it. You are right, many people have had numerous revisions without surgical issues. My wife has had several herself. You have to decide if risk outweighs living with your current symptoms. \n\nQuilt1974, the opiate \"crisis\" has impacted my wife as well. You are absolutely right about not getting care for pain anymore in ER (U.S.). My wife has been vomiting, crying and they would not provide pain relief on several occasions. They stated she has red flags due to her numerous ER visits. WELL YEAH! Dr.s have not fixed her! You call your doctor with pain issues and they say go to ER!  Cannot take home pain meds (if you can get them) because you will vomit them up. It is a serious issue and the clamp down on opiates hurts chronic pain sufferers more than the 1% abusers. It is so harrowing to watch your loved one suffer and no one will help or worse, treat you with disdain as a drug seeker. Then you search for an ER that will help you and more red flags because your a hospital hopper.  So yeah, everyone has to roll that into their considerations when thinking about solutions to IIH symptoms. It is good to ask about how your surgeon and neuro will help you handle any daily pain and acute, intense pain post surgery. Thanks for the reply, I was in a bit of a similar situation, from age 12-22 I had headaches everyday 24/7, but they never wanted to do surgery because my scans looked normal. It was not till I went to the hospital and found a surgeon who told me sometimes the scans do like fine during a malfunction or partial malfunction. \n\nOpiate crisis has impacted me too, I remember when I was 12 they gave me morphine for the pain, at age 22 all they offered me was... Tylenol. For brain surgery. Thanks. I will be going through with the surgery, complications are a bit scary though when pondered on.! Did you have any revisions close to each other in terms of time? Yes, I was going to include that but did not get that in as I was on the way to work.  My first 3 revisions were clustered about a week apart, and the last two were roughly a week apart.  All related to the repositioning of the shunt in those cases.  I would actually say that is one of the most common issues with revisions, you might need another soon after if the positioning was off, which still happens as it is a very sensitive procedure. Your welcome....I think this opiate crisis is getting ridiculous. The people that have been on opiates for certain reasons are FINALLY getting a little attention in the aspect that in the USA Today newspaper the CDC has put out a message that if someone has been on an  opiate regimen  for quite a while the doctors as supposed to leave things alone. However there are many people that these doctors have just cut off cold turkey, which is cruel. These doctors KNOW how is abusing their medications....and it is these people they should be watching NOT someone that has not done anything wrong. I think this type of thing is wrong, and to expect someone who has surgery to just deal with the pain with Tylenol....is again, off base and ridiculous IMO. UncluckySands6,\n\nBelieve me I know what your wife is going through. Has your wife tried to see someone who is an internal medicine doctor?  Has she tried to get a referral for a pain clinic? At this stage of the game, I would suggest that you try what I suggested. The more she goes to the ER, the worse it is going to get for her. Is it WRONG? Absolutely 100% There is no excuse for these doctors and ER's to treat someone with head pain from Hydro surgery as they do.I have had to INSIST on the form you sigh for CHECK-OUT of an ER that the nurses or doctors writes on the form that I did NOT ask for any type of opiate pain meds, simply because you have not a CLUE as to what the hell those nurses or doctors COULD write on the form once YOU leave, and I had insisted on this YEARS ago, WAY before this opiate crisis. Trust me, these doctors has to be pretty stupid years ago to not think that an OPIATE crisis was not going to happen. In the 80's-90's and part of the 20's they were handing Opiates out like candy. These doctors and BIG Pharma HAD to thee was going to be a HUGE CRISIS because of the way they handed Opiates out like candy.\n\nI have not been to an ER since 2011.....I refuse to be admitted when the doctor says \"Just to to the ER and do an admit there.\" I tell them NO....they can direct admit me, but I am not, I repeat NOT going through an admit through the Emergency Room.\n\nOne thing I have done when I get a serious headache. I usually will take Excedrin PM (2 tablets) and then wait 2 hours and take 3 more tablets if the headache is severe AND THEN I take 2-3 Benadryl Tablets and that usually helps somewhat. The Benadryl helps me to go to sleep a lot easier. Maybe your wife can try that.\n\nIF she needs someone to chat with, tell her she is welcome to msg me here.\n\nLastly, watching a spouse go through things like this is not easy I know. My DH had a seizure disorder, and I know how terrible it is to watch someone you love go through something like that, and know that you really cannot help them much.\n\nI have been thinking about looking into Medical Marijuana because it is legal in my state. Maybe if it is legal in your state, your wife might consider looking into it perhaps. She is tried every OTC pain reliever there is, in combination with Benadryl, all the prescription migraine meds, medical marijuana, all the nausea meds, we have an internal medicine doc and she is currently in pain management.\n\nWe have been dealing with this for a long time and try to avoid the ER but, when her pain spikes to a level 10, she cannot take anything orally because she will be vomiting. Trying to get non-oral pain relief for acute pain at home but it is not something current pain management practice offers. She is taking buccal strips for moderate, daily pain but there is nothing for extreme pain. Likely will be looking into different pain management if they cannot do anything for us.\n\nWhat I would suggest for anyone in similar situation, consistent pattern of pain and/or frequent ER visits for pain, is to get referred to pain management by neuro and establish a protocol for moderate and severe pain. If that protocol requires ER, have pain management/neuro get that protocol communicated by them to ER facility preemptively.  Ideally, one of your doctors is associated with hospital system and can get that in your records else they may have to fax information over to ER facility. Another option is to have ER docs call your pain management/neuro and confirm protocol when you go in. Still there is no guarantee nor requirement that ER docs have to follow any protocol other than the one they want to follow.\n\nFor anyone dealing with pain from IIH or hydrocephalus, have the pain protocol discussion with your doctors before you need it, especially ahead of any procedures, surgeries, shunt setting adjustments, new meds, i.e., some sort of change. 1 revision 2 replacements 28years old", "Shunt replacement Hi everyone! \nIn a week, I have to get my shunt replaced due to a bacterial infection in my spinal fluid. Ive had revisions before but never a full replacement, and I was just wondering if the surgeons would change the location that the shunt is currently in and out it in a new ventricle, or if they would just re-open my pre-existing scar and place the new one where the old one was? \nThank you in advance! Totally depends.\n\nI just had two revisions done (after 20 years strong and no prior revisions) and they said it was possible they would put it l the left side this time. That tube did not replaced though. \n\nSending strong good vibes. You are bad ass and got this shit Thank you for your response! I just was not sure what the criteria was as to whether or not they would move it, but I guess I will just have to wait and see! In my case, this year I had to have three surgeries due to my shunt malfunctioning. The first two times they just replaced a few of the parts, but I was still having issues so on the third one they just replaced the whole thing. My original shunt was in the back right hand corner of my head now it is on the edge of the right side of my head ( So they only slightly moved it).\n\n\nI am sorry your spinal fluid got infected...just know that everything will be okay... I got an infection not long after my shunt was first placed. \nInitially on right side of my head, infection in csf meant it was temporarily externalised ( out of head taped to chest.\nHad an appendectomy and laparotomy ( in the area where the infection drained into ).\nThe shunt was fully removed, infection cleared after weeks of antibiotics and then a new shunt places on the left side. I am not sure if the alternate side was because I had had other surgeries  ( tumour) or so when it drain it was not into the same place previously infected. \n\nGood luck I have had 10 full replacements (including 2 infections) and they have never moved the location of my shunt. But as u/BrutalWarPig said, it totally depends on the situation. No problem. Never hurts to ask your doctor or their nurse / assistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSending you positive vibes!!", "Can a shunt be moved to a different spot? My newest shunt (my third) was put in in 2003, but for the last couple years its placement has really begun to bother me. It is placed in such a way that when I am laying flat on my back or on my right side the entire weight of my skull pushes down directly on the reservoir... so the only way that I can lay without putting pressure on it constantly involves either laying flat with my head turned to the left - which strains the muscles in my neck after a while, or laying completely on my left side which probably is not too good for the heart. You would need to convince the surgeons that this is enough of a reason to move it but yes it can be moved. There are four placements normally, back left and right and top left and right. I have has shunts in both back positions and top right. The top was/is far more comfortable. this one's about an inch up and back from the right ear, an older one is an inch higher than that and my third is on the front left. Would a softer pillow help alleviate some of the pressure on the shunt?  I have tried many pillows, but it does not change the fact that the shunt is the first point of contact with whatever surface I lay on and the entire weight of my head pushes down on it. I had the same problem after I had a new shunt put in on the right side (I had a shunt on the left which malfunctioned after twenty or so years of use). If the Shunt is new, the reservoir will be somewhat hard, so any sort of pressure on it will bring some discomfort for a while but should soften up eventually. However, if you have had this problem for a long time, I suggest seeing your Neurosurgeon, they might be able to make an adjustment.", "My daughter has a possible shunt infection looking for advice She went to er yesterday for a temp of 103.2 with a high white blood cell count and low platelet count could it be possible that she has an infection It could definitely be possible. Did they send her home with that high of a fever? They should definitely rule out a shunt infection for sure. I am attaching an article for you to read reguarding shunt infections. \n\n Has she had any other symptoms i.e. massive headache, excessive sleepiness, it could also be failing or she could be \u201csick\u201d and not have anything to do with the shunt. Either way you want to keep an eye on her cognitive status. How old is she? 20 months and she was sleeping a lot and vomited it almost goes with flu like symptoms they did an mri but we are waiting for results Ok Did they discharge her? is she still eating for you at all even though she is vomiting? She went to the local we but transferred her to a specialist hospital where her neurologist is someone would have read the MRI immediately after it was taken a lot of times that is done elsewhere. However, if there was a problem they would have seen it immediately with the MRI. I would monitor the fever and her fluid intake and contact your pediatrician and let them know. She probably has a regular infection or sickness. Is the shunt red or puffy at all? And no they did not discharge yet Your pediatrician can also get the MRI results faster for you if necessary. If the fever is still that high you need to let them know that immediately. She needs to be cooled down try cool baths and cloths do not let her fever get any higher. I am sure they will be running a bunch of tests in the hospital on her to see what is going on exactly. My heart goes out to your family I know how stressful it can be. \u2764\ufe0f How long ago was her surgery? I have not had to deal with a shunt infection with my daughter, but I have been told the chances of an infection decrease with time. I was always worried that was the case during regular illnesses and our neurosurgeon said that after somewhere in between 6-8 months the chance of infection is extremely low since the body has not been exposed to the outside world. Shunt infections are most likely to be near the incisions and can be accompanied by local tenderness so now we always probe, poke and ask our three year old if any of her shunt areas hurt when she is sick. Shunt infection can happen anytime. However it is most likely to happen within the first year.  Staphylococcus Epidermidis is the most likely infection. If the white blood count is high they would test the csf to confirm.\n\nUnfortunately there is no treatment to kill the infection while the shunt is placed ,as the antibiotics cannot cover the shunt, so the shunt will need to be removed and antibiotics administrated for a few weeks.\n\nThis is not an easy time but this will improve! Just wondering how your daughter is doing?  Hoping she is doing better and your family has some answers by now \ud83d\ude4f The neurologist and the pediatrician did not find anything wrong with the shunt it is still working fine so they chalked it up to just a 24 bug possibly but she seems to be doing better just a bit jittery is all Well that is wonderful news. I am so glad it seems to be working out in her favor this time. Keep the sites that were posted on what to watch for by myself and the other person so if you come across anything again you can reference them quickly. We are Sooo happy for your family \ud83d\ude00", "Hydrocephalus &amp; COVID-19 Vaccine I have not seen any posts about this and hate to be the first if I am... but I finally had the vaccine a week ago and wanted to let others know of my experience. I understand that having Hydrocephalus does not mean we are at immediate risk to the virus and I think getting the vaccine is a very sensible thing to do, if it is an option for you. \n\nI work for the NHS in mental health services and received my AstraZeneca vaccine around 1pm last Friday. I was not expecting any symptoms really except maybe a sore arm.\n\nBy around 4pm I started to get symptoms of a migraine (which is not uncommon for me but the nurse had informed me that I may experience a headache and to take over-the-counter medication for that). Therefore I did not take my usual migraine meds from my neurologist straight away. \n\nBy 6pm my body was on fire, I sweat through my clothes and I was a shivering wreck, I had the worst migraine I have ever had (by around 8pm I gave in and took my stronger prescription meds) and I vomited pretty much everything I would swallowed that day (including medication). I also had a rash all over my legs and breathlessness.\n\nThese symptoms lasted the entire weekend, meaning I had been unable to eat anything for three days. This really set me back. Unfortunately, I had my vaccine two days before Valentine\u2019s Day which was slightly disappointing as my partner and I could not celebrate properly. But a week later and I am finally getting back on track and I am so grateful that I did get it, as if I reacted this aggressively to the vaccine, who knows how my body would have coped with the actual virus. \n\nIf you are able to get the vaccine, I highly recommend that you do. But be mindful that you may experience feeling generally unwell for a few days. I have no idea if my experience is unique to me, or related to my neurological condition. But it is good to stay informed regardless, I hope it was ok for me to share this here. I am sorry you had that experience, that sounds awful! I got my second dose of the Moderna vaccine a week ago and the worst I got was a really sore arm and lots of fatigue. Thankfully, after both vaccines I was able to rest a lot and take it easy. I am currently having other health issues that are making me miserable, but I do not think it is related. I am no scientist, but I seem to fare pretty well with vaccines and the Covid vaccine was not super hard on me. I hope you feel better soon! Hey! Me too, very fatigued- I basically slept for three days and only woke for brief moments to drink water. I have not felt that unwell since my stay in hospital having the shunt surgery. I am usually ok with vaccines too but I had such a strong reaction this time, it scared me! But it is nice to hear that others have had the vaccine with the same condition and been ok, so thank you for sharing &lt;3 Hydro resulting from brain tumour but as not undergoing treatment I do not fall under groups so will be a few months before I get mine. \nGlad you are feeling better I got the moderna vaccine this week. I have hydro. My arm hurt and that was it. No other symptoms. I had 6 surgeries right when covid started. I talked to both my NS and neurologist before taking. They both said there should be no issues and highly recommended it. Everyone will respond differently to the vaccine. Hydro is a brain disease and should push you higher in the list. Was this your first or second dose? I am also a healthcare worker with hydrocephalus in the UK and I felt ill after my first dose. Sore arm as expected, but I also felt headachy and fatigued. Not as bad as your experience however, I am sorry that happened to you.\n\nI have heard the second dose response can be quite bad...I am not looking forward to it, but I suppose it will be worth doing. That is awesome, I have never met anyone with my condition who also works in healthcare. It was my first dose. I am half expecting the second dose in two months to be easier as my body has already reacted. But I may book a few days off work just in case (if I can). If I am honest, I have not heard much about the second dose and I am trying not to think about it too much. But fingers crossed we are both ok :) I will mention my symptoms to the nurse when I get the second dosage and maybe they will be able to give some clarity. My daughter had the second dose two days ago, she had a shunt revision two weeks ago\nNo issues...i know this is all individually based..but thought I would share.. \nI hope all of you have many good days over bad.. Be well I hope you have access to the vaccine soon! I hope all is well with you too Sorry to hear that and I hope you are doing well. I did not get the vaccine because of my hydro, I got it because I work for the NHS. They are vaccinating NHS employees rapidly at the moment Best of luck, I wish her a speedy recovery. Fingers crossed the second dose will not be as bad as the first I had my first Pfizer dose 2 weeks ago. I just felt arm soreness and slightly more fatigue than usual (fatigue is common for me) but that was it. I have had a shunt for 11 years.", "Medication List Help I have to complete an assignment on hydrocephalus and medications. I was hoping someone would be so kind as to offer me their medication list (even just 5 ). Im required to make up a medication administation record for someone with a diagnosis of hydrocephalus.

It is an anti seizure med but it is used for hydro and other neurological issues. Topamax is another similar drug. I hope two help you! What an odd assignment. Primary hydrocephalus (w/shunt) and no comorbidites is not going to have a med list. Something to keep in mind is that Hydrocephalus is not a disease it is a condition. The cause of it can be from diseases though. I would suggest you research the different types of hydrocephalus (ie obstructed, normal pressure, etc). That should give you a little more perspective on the treatment people receive for hydrocephalus. I know its silly. We were all assigned a \"intellectual or developmental disability\" and asked to make a med list lol like ok what some people got down syndrome, autism... i got hc lol I am not sure it is even considered an intellectual disability, you can have a learning disability with your hydro but it is not one by itself ... more of a physical one I guess The only thing I take now and again is ibuprofen. After surgery it is been a mix of painkillers from Oxycontin, OxyNorm, ibuprofen etc\n\nBut like people have already pointed out; HC are not really a medication heavy condition", "How bad is it? At the hospital now. Took my mom to her appointment and the doctor just came in with the news. They taking her to another hospital to a specialist/neurosurgeon. I am scared shitless with this talk of a shunts and surgeries.\n\nWhat can you tell me? I am doing researchnow. I am guessing you are probably dealing with normal pressure hydrocephalus if she was just first diagnosed as an adult. Shunt surgery is pretty quick, been performed millions of times, and has remained relatively unchanged for decades. My daughter was born with it, and while she may have a more complicated life than other kids, it should not affect her life span nor her physical or mental capacities since it was discovered while she was still in the hospital.  I forced her to finally go to her checkup after what we thought was a really bad flu. Cue a bunch of tests and a lecture for not doing something sooner (like I can force a grown woman to go to the hospital), we will be transferred soon-ish.\n\nMe? I do not want to make this about me but I never would have thought this in a million years and now I am trying to not panic. Also sorry to hear about your daughter. Glad it is working out for her.  I am a 33 year old who has had a diagnosis of hydrocephalus since 2007.  I work as a software developer and commute on my bike.  For the majority of the time I am barely aware that I have a shunt.  I am more sensitive to pressure changes, my hydration, and any knocks to the right side of my head (where the valve is located) and that is about it in terms of impact to every day life.  The only other issue is that the shunt system can occasionally break down which can cause some uncomfortable to painful symptoms due to over/under pressure inside the skull.  Depending on the severity you go to a neurosurgeon either through a normal visit or the ER and they fix the issue with a surgery and you are back up and running after recovering from the anesthesia.  Since it does impact the brain you tend to get priority care.  Note, these breakdowns can vary wildly, I went eight years without needing anything done and then three years after that I had another revision.  Not fun but definitely manageable. It is hard not to panic. I brought running shoes with me to many hospitals just because a 30 minute jog helped me keep my sanity and give family a little room to breath when they were stuck in a room. Try not to over research. Most people only write the scary stuff or bad experiences. On top of that we are not doctors and it can be easy to over diagnose as a laymen. Do take notes though if you are a need to know type person. I learned what every machine in my daughters room did though. There is a fine line to knowing what is going on and not watching the actual patient. I.e. we were always told not to watch the monitors and to focus on our child. I knew what she was connected to from my research but I tried not to stare at it when I was able to spend time with her (long term nicu baby).  The surgery itself is routine. It may take a few adjustments of the shunt to find her perfect pressure. She may get some tummy cramps from the tubing. I am the relative of a new shuntee, I know just how much you are crapping your dacks. Message me if you want to chat.   I have been diagnosed since a couple weeks after birth, but it totally is not that bad surgery-wise. Recovery depends on what is done and what is fixed. After my revisions (I have only had 3) it is taken me about a month, maybe a little less to be pretty much back to normal. Everyone has different reactions to shunts. Some have immune systems that really have a problem with them, mine does not. After surgery the tubing in her neck will make her neck feel sore and stiff and hard to turn. This will go away and she can turn her head normally after at least a couple weeks. She will also be able to sleep on that side after she recovers. It could really be worse in my opinion. I am thankful I just have these surgeries instead of having to worry about something like injections every couple hours or meds or something. Also, once shunted she can probably live a completely normal life again. Also, you can check out the free resources from the Hydrocephalus Association. they have tons of articles and info on their website, and they have free peer support that you can call. I am not certain, but I think you can also email them. They match you with a person who has been in a similar situation or who has the condition who has a similar type of hydro or is close in age to who you are caring for. You can also check out the hydro facebook pages. There are a lot of them and a decent amount are pretty active. Definitely a lot more active than the Reddit group.  So, we went through all of this 2 years ago. After years of miss diagnosis and drug after drug. We finally got our answer by a new family doc actually listening. \n\nMy wife (37F) has normal pressure hydrocephalus. Her cue was loss of vision due to optic nerve impingement. The first surgery took 3 hours, and 3 days in ICU/Step down. Honestly them hardest part for her was shaving her head. However, two weeks later she had a shunt revision (valve replacement) due to skin not healing over and a blockage. Stuff happens. In the 2 years since, she has had a complete \u201ccure\u201d which is amazing. It is scary at first, but overall it is not bad and almost \u201croutine\u201d.\n\nPlease reach out if we can answer any questions.  \"This is just plumbing.\" This is what the neurosurgeon told my parents when he first put in my shunt, 20 years ago, and he was right. Your daughter is going to be fine. This is literally one of the most easiest \"brain surgeries\" you can get. It is like getting a drain pipe attached to your gutters, except probably even less invasive than that, since you do not even need bolts for this. \n\nI am really glad that shunt stuff was/is the only surgeries I have ever needed. It is the best of both worlds. Piece of cake for neurosurgery to knock out of the park, and you get priority everything still because it (only technically, really) still has to do with your brain.\n\nNot going to lie to you, your daughter might hurt a lot directly after. It gets better, to the point that I barely remember I have hydrocephalus. I have 0 pain now on a day to day, or honestly, month to month basis. I went ~18 years since first installation until I even remembered I had hardware installed. The only other time I felt different was when I ran, and the shunt felt like it \"rubbed\" in my neck. After a few laps though, it would stop hurting, and this was only mild discomfort.\n\nAlso, sometimes, some people feel a \"brain fog,\" which I felt after my middle surgery, but once I really started realizing I was probably imagining it, it went away. What they do in these surgeries is not nearly as invasive as it might sound, or as you might imagine. It is pretty much all external from the skull to my understanding. And your brain is not nearly as \"soft\" as people think it is. It is going to be for the most part not messed with in this surgery, and the tiny parts that might be touched, they will be touched by someone who knows what they are doing, who is being gentle.\n\nIf I could choose a problem for my kid to have, I would pick hydrocephalus + shunt or ETV for tons of cases. Diabetes? No thanks on either type. Amputation? Nah, I like all my limbs. Peanut allergy? Screw that, peanut butter is awesome!\n\nThere are things that could go wrong, and I have had the big, scary, catastrophic things happen. They hurt, it was not fun, but it was okay. I ended up better because of it. The big, scary things sound scarier than they are in general, but are way less scary when you live through them. And you have to remember that the really big, scary things are REALLY rare. They in general, do not happen. You probably will not have to deal with any of the really crazy stuff. The more common things, like revisions, they happen, but they are caught pretty quickly (again, we are not REALLY brain surgery people, we are just grouped with them so we get preferential treatment, and medical people watch us like hawks) and with any decently competent neurosurgery team, nipped in the bud.\n\nI know the look in my parents' eyes when they talk about my history with hydrocephalus. There is a deep, sickening fear that you get, that I admittedly do not understand, when your child is sick. This is scary, but once your daughter is out of anesthesia, this will be more traumatizing for you than for her. Even if she is like me and actually allergic to anesthesia, which means lots of puking. Even if that happens, I promise she will be okay.\n\nGood luck! Thanks. Will respond later but it is my mom, no kids on my end yet\n Oops! Sorry. I misread that. Your mom will be okay. ", "Shunts Can someone please give me more information on my new shunt all I know is that to my mom he described it as a \"fancy shunt we can change the settings on.\" The surgeon assistant called it a service shunt. It feels huge in the back of my head and he took all the tubbing out on my neck so that is not there anymore. But he did say the tubbing is coiled up in my stomach with scar tissue from my other surgeries. I do not understand how that happens  Augh.  Beware MRIs.  They use a magnet to change the setting on programmable shunts.  MRIs can fuck up the setting.  You will have to go straight to your NS to get it readjusted if you have to have an MRI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast time that happened for me, it was actually bouncing between two settings, which should not be possible.  I do not know what the deal was, but I would had two separate MRIs in one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou will get used to the heavy feeling soon enough. OmG ibwas thinking about MRI yesterday. I think that is why when I was in my surgery I only has 2xrays and 1 CT I mean, obviously there are times when it is the best imaging for what the doctor needs and you cannot avoid them, just know you might be a bit out of it after, and the NS will have to readjust the setting.\n\nI felt like this after the 2 in one day MRIs:   It does not hurt to have a programmable shunt adjusted. They just put it over the top of your shunt for about a minute and that changes the pressure. They usually do a skull x-ray to verify the setting. I have had my programmable shunt for 10 years and have had no problems with it. Sure beats having surgery to adjust the pressure. I have seen the way they adjust it. Does it hurt? Not at all  Ok so this is my question. When my surgeon went to go look for me in my room (I was in the restroom) he lunged at me and touched my neck and was like \"look feel your neck there is no more tubbing there. That feels better right?\" But later he was like you are not going home today anymore because the tubbing is coiled up in your stomach and sticking to the scar tissue from your other surgeries. So if there is no tubbing in my neck but it is in my stomach how is the CFS moving and where does it go? Ok I will keep that in mind. Does it hurt to get MRI now? Yes, because the programmable shunt is set with magnets, an MRI will always mess with the setting.   Oh God I do not want MRI now The good news is that your NS can quickly and easily fix the setting.  \n\nMy last two MRIs were not even of my head, one was cervical spine and one was lumbar spine. I think that is why it went so weird.   Ah I see. I have to go to the doctor when I finish with this because they found a cyst on my ovary Hopefully it is nothing serious.\n\nJust remember to keep your NS in the loop if you have to have an MRI, so they can fit you in to check the settings, and you will be fine. So many questions. Why was your neurosurgeon lunging at you? That is really creepy. I also feel like he is misinforming you about your neck tubing. A VP shunt has tubing that connects to the ventricular catheter, then to the valve, and then runs to the peritoneum(the lining of the abdominal wall) There is no way for a shunt to work properly with the neck tubing removed. Neurosurgeons commonly leave a coiled section in the abdomen to allow the shunt to \"grow\" with the patient, I do not see a reason to keep you in the hospital unless he is planning another surgery to free the tubing from the scar tissue, and even then it should be clearly explained to you well before any procedure is performed.   I have to go get a ultrasound or sonogram to check that idk if I need anything else Well idk I am not doing good with movement or other things moving around me so it might just be he was moving too fast. He didnt say he was going to touch me so I was not aware. He is very nice though. There is nothing there I keep touching my neck and nothing. He kind of explained it before but not really but I trust him so I was ok with it It is possible that the shunt tubing was rerouted to the back of your neck, depending on the location of the valve. Where on your head is the incision?  I agree, this does seem possible. Back right. The tubbing used to go down the right side of my neck now there is nothing there and I do not know where he put it Probably no other scans, for it, no. It is also possible that the NS buried the tubing deeper into the subcutaneous tissue so you no longer feel it. I had a shunt that was very prominent along the neck as well but after my next revision, it was difficult to find/feel.\n  Not sure Maybe that is what he did I am not sure Any other questions, feel free to ask. I will answer what I can!", "HYDROCEPHALUS | A RESULT FROM AN ASSAULT ", "Having strange symptoms I keep getting occasional chest pains (coming from where my shunt is). They are not *extreme*, just uncomfortable. They only last a couple minutes \n\nLast neurology visit was in February and prior to that i had not seen anyone in around 4 years since all was well. \n\nThe February visit was bc I had a lump on my neck by the valve and it freaked me and my mum out- ultrasound confirmed that my shunt is not even in my stomach anymore (and so is not functioning pretty much) as I have had it since I was 6mo but I have been ok.\n\nI have also been getting more headaches than usual, also not extreme, just uncomfortable. Or at least no where near what I used to experience (not hydro standard) \n\nI have started a new job and it means I go to bed late (11pm-12am) and I get up at 7:30am for school so I feel like that could be the cause of the headaches but with the chest pains, I am thinking it is my shunt.\n\n\nI have also developed a squishy spot where my shunt is (which was not there when I had my last neurologist visit) It is been there since may I definitely would tell her to make an appointment with your neurologist ASAP. The squishy spot is my main concern when I read this. Squishy spots near shunts usually means built up fluid, which is never good. It could be a slow build up if it is been there since may \n\nAs far as it not being in your stomach anymore and essentially not working, some people\u2019s body\u2019s will start to absorb the fluid through other tissue in the body to compensate and basically just live with the shunt in but not using it anymore. However like I said the squishy spot is definitely concerning, it is possible your body was absorbing but now is not absorbing all of the fluid and therefore is making a slow build up. \n\nThe headaches I would not worry about. I have Hydrocephalus, have had a shunt since 3mo and get pressure headaches almost everyday. They usually go away or at least get significantly less painful after I take Tylenol. \n\nI would definitely say to tell your mom to make a call, explain all your symptoms including the squishy bump. Better safe than sorry, if the bump is fluid built up things can go down hill pretty quickly. If you start vomiting and/or feel dizzy call your neuro and go to the ER ASAP", "1 Anyone here have an atypical treatment to hydro? I have an intra-ventricular catheter (not shunted) and it is left me in fairly good shape until now (maybe). Want To compare.

A little background about me.  I acquired Hydrocephalus at the age of 47 and my symptoms vary throughout the year and right now I am waking up even more nauseous than at other times of the year. \n\nMy tinnitus has also increased yet my ongoing headaches have decreased a little bit.\n\n I had an incisional hernia repaired in September and the shunt tube was moved, the neurosurgeon said the shunt was working fine. \n\n The last time I had an adjustment was a few years back trying counter the hearing loss ( and the ongoing headaches) l suffered from after the VP surgery. \n\nI was charged $800 for that two minute adjustment I have just gone with the \"flow\" since my wife is still paying for the VP surgery. \n\nI hope this post is not too confusing since I am struggling to keep my thoughts together these days. \n\n I have not had a programmable shunt in 20 years so I cannot offer any advice about adjustments. However, all your symptoms are indicating pressure issues and it is very easy to get used to a headache and think that it is gotten better when it has not. Particularly when the other symptoms get \"more annoying\" than the headache. I live in a country where I have never paid a cent for my shunt revisions or check ups so I guess I cannot really appreciate the cost issue but you really need to get checked out asap. I have started leaving my blocked shunts a little too long over the last few years and I am starting to get lasting damage to my sight and hearing. It is not worth it, make an appointment or go to the hospital now. Got adjustable shunt last May, have had 5 adjustments since then. Protocol is to get a CT scan to confirm over/underdrainage, then adjusting accordingly.  Thank you for the reply. This has been going on for about two weeks now. During the Fall the tinnitus and my hearing problems increase ( no increase with nausea) for a couple of months and settles down but I have never had this type of problem in the Spring and the increased nausea has me worried. I was hoping that correcting the incisional hernia which was caused by the placement of the shunt tube would of helped but it seems it did not. Looks like I will need to see the neurosurgeon once again. Thanks again for the reply.  Thank you for the reply. I have only been on the two lowest setting. Also on all my scans before and after the surgery my ventricle size has never changed. \n \nAfter my last adjustment a few years back they told me the next step was icp monitoring which due to finances I did not have done.\n\n This happens to me when my shunt is blocked and they CT to check for ventricle expansion. I have slit ventricle syndrome so my ventricles are tiny and rigid. I am not sure if it is possible for ventricles to be a normal size but still rigid but it could be worth talking to your surgeons about. Rigid ventricles make picking pressures and things very finicky. My ventricles have remained larger than normal.  After the VP surgery I did get some relief from the shuffling, being hunched over and the excessive sleeping patterns but have experienced other complications like hearing loss, the incisional hernia which became incarcerated, and the tinnitus. ", "Memory Loss So I am 28 and have had 1 revision and 2 replacements but after this last replacement I have had a hard time remembering things I have an Intillectual disability so I have had some issues with memory but this time it is gotten bad going into a room and not remembering what I needed anyone else have this issue ? Constantly and it seems to have gotten worse with every consecutive surgery; I have had 19. I cannot remember names or faces until I have met someone many many times and even then it is only sometimes. If I have a long conversation with a new person and they walk away and come back, I will reintroduce myself because I do not recognize them. It is very awkward. So I just started letting people know as soon as we exchange names. I agree mine seems worse and I am just frustrated! I hate to discourage you but just telling you how my life has been. I am 29 and I have had 27 shunt revisions. My memory, long and short term are shot. I have to constantly use my GPS to get around my city I have lived in for the past 12 years. I can see people in the store and walk right past them and they think that I am ignoring them, but I am not, I literally did not know who they were until they introduced themselves to me. I have people in my family, sure they are distant, at a family reunion we have every year, I do not know peoples names or faces. At work, someone can talk to me and we have a whole discussion about something and two or three hours later I go to them and ask them when we are going to talk about the issue that we discussed earlier in the day like we never even talked about it. My iPhone reminder app, calendar and maps app are my best friend. When I set an appointment for something I immediately put it in the calendar and notes app. I have pushed forward and been able to get my associates as a scrub tech and am now in school to get my BA in communications to work as a medical device sales rep. Do not be ashamed of your bad memory, embrace it and work around it in life. Do not let it slow you down. Feel free to PM me with any questions you have. As I have gotten older, my short term memory has worsened a little bit, but I think this is a natural progression of age. I try VERY hard not to blame everything that has hapened to me on my shunt placement and subsequent revisions (33 in all)\n\nI am not saying any of you are blaming your issue on your experiences, but I just believe that it is better to try to remedy the situation by doing small things to help with the memory loss, etc. I pride myself on being able to function VERY well. I do record a list of things to do every day, and I keep active. I read, play word games and in general try to live life to the fulliest.\n\nI do believe that you should consult with your doctor and/or get some short term therapy to help you along the rough patches. I have this all the time and I have hydrocephalus but I have not had a shunt before so idk", "Does heat help your head and shoulder before a storm?  For me, sometimes it helps, but sometimes ice is better.  Sorry for the contradiction. I have heard both. No worries. Ice makes mine worse  100% yes, although I do not really experience the shoulder pain before a storm, only head discomfort. But when I do get the shoulder flare ups, I bundle up and blast it with a heating pad and I am usually good after that.

They have different facts and are great for sharing on social media:  More people need to be aware of this.  It is been a struggle for most of my life to get accommodations for side effects of my hydro mainly eyesight, headaches and mental fog.  I tell people what I have and they immediately start an interrogation process almost accusing me of making up excuses for having to stay home or not getting something done on time etc.  They do it in a very beat around the bush sort of way but to me it is obvious. Yes, there does need to be more awareness. Feel free to go to the website that I linked in the comments and share some of the graphics. Also check out the other info and resources on the site. \n\nI am sorry that you do not have a better support system. My son who turn 31 this month was born with hydro. He is had approximately 19 brain surgeries. He is on disability due to Hydrocephalus and other related conditions. He has, in the past several years, lost complete vision in his right eye due to pressure on his optic nerve because of a shunt malfunction. He is always had vision problems and is currently seeing a neuro-ophthalmologist and talking with our state blind services to receive some help. \n\nI hope that you can find some information to share with your friends and family to help explain more about this incurable condition. Do not worry so much about those who are not friends or family, you do not owe them an explanation. You just do what is best for you and your well-being. Remember that everyone is situation is different. I love seeing post by others who are doing well and working or attending college. I think that is awesome and the Hydrocephalus Assoc even awards scholarships each year for those who can further their education. But I also know that not everyone is able to work or go to college. My son does a lot of volunteer work on days that he is able. Shout out to my Hydro Homies! We are strong! Yes! I will have to admit that every Hydro-warrior that I have met is really tough! My son and I have met quite a few great people at the Hydrocephalus Association walks and in Facebook groups. Some of the strongest people that I know! Thanks for the link! I like the different pictures with facts. My dad had his shunt surgery in February. I did not know what hydrocephalus was until my dad was diagnosed with it. Then I found out how many people have it and that there was this amazing subreddit. You guys are awesome. Stay strong and safe! Sending hugs. It is a real struggle for me since I have no surviving family.  I am 32 and I lost both my parents to cancer and sister to a heart attack.  Back in 2019 I had to go for surgery because my 29 year old shunt broke and I was laying in a bed at the local small hospital about to be transported to a bigger hospital to have surgery and I was thinking who TF do I even call.  It was in that moment I realized if something really bad happens I am essentially screwed. I cannot even imagine how you feel. My son is an only child and I really worry about who will be around to help him when something happens to me and his dad. It must be really hard to not have someone when you are going through surgery. On another note, 29 is a really long time to go between revisions, I hope that shunt will last you another 29 years or more! My son\u2019s 2nd shunt lasted around 14 years. He is had around 19 brain surgeries now.", "Rant about the very weird discomfort from hyper focusing on shunt tubing (and veins.) I do not know if this will make sense to anybody else if it is just me. When I scratch my skin and feel a vein, it gives me the same insane amount of discomfort that comes when you scratch over your tubing. I have had a VP shunt since 3month olds with zero revisions. I would always freak out when my mom would go to part my hair and rub her nail over the raised tubing, and recently I have been having the same feeling over touching my veins. Once I feel the \u2018this is not normal and is horribly cringy\u2019 feeling I just cannot stop thinking about the many many veins (natural tubes) that are throughout my body. I am assuming I am feeling this way towards my veins because of my tubing but it is very draining to be in a constant state of such extreme psychological cringing that it is causing physical discomfort. I cannot remove my veins or my tubing obviously and I do not think anybody without the tubing (like a therapist) will quite understand. Has anyone experienced this and how did you manage it? I think a therapist might actually be a great option. There are quite a few medical conditions that necessitate an implanted device. Coping with that has to be extremely difficult for a lot of people. It may take some time, but I would think you could find some one with relevant experience that could help. Not all psychologists are the same so keep an open mind if one does not work for you. Your local sub Reddit or neurosurgeon may have leads for you? And here is me, forgetting about my shunt until i bang my head somewhere xD This is good advice.", "Has anybody else needed physical therapy? After my ETV surgery I was having trouble walking and have been dealing with neck stiffness that I need help with Yep, after a shunt replacement I woke up and could not stand up without falling. I did heaps of neurophysio and occupational therapy to get back to normal.", "Son's MRI shows extra fluid, but not hydrocephalus? Shocked and confused. At a routine pediatrician visit back in September 2017, a nurse took a head circumference measurement for our 11-month-old son and it was almost off the chart. His pediatrician measured again and got a smaller number. But at his next appointment, a few months later, the measurement they took made it look like there had been a rapid increase in head circumference, compared with the updated measurement the doctor took in September.\n\nThis set us on the path to where we are today. We were referred to a neurologist, saw him and he wanted an MRI done. We did the MRI in December and a couple weeks later heard that everything looked fine. But several weeks back we heard that there **is** some extra fluid in the frontal lobe area. \n\nWe were completely shocked. This entire time both the pediatrician and the neurologist have said they are not concerned. His development is right on track and everything checks out. Despite the extra fluid the neurologist has said it **is not** hydrocephalus, but he wants to do a follow-up MRI this coming December. If the follow-up MRI still shows extra fluid then, we will consult with a surgeon. Surgery would be our worst nightmare. \n\nWe feel confused. I do not understand how we got an all-clear if there is indeed extra fluid. And we have been told over and over by the doctors that they are not concerned because he is developing normally. It is all really scary and I do not know what we should do, if anything. The mixed signals from the neurologist's office make me think we should get a second opinion, hut that might mean more tests. Just looking for thoughts and advice. Thanks. First off you should ask your neurologist to explain what they think is happening. Second it is a great sign that your baby is developing on track. I am not a neurologist so take my opinion as that of an experienced parent who has lived through far more than I am listing. \n\nMy daughter was born premature at 2 pounds at 27 weeks and was diagnosed with grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhaging almost immediately. She had elevated fluid levels in her brain. Their prognosis was pretty similar to yours. Make sure she developed ok and keep an eye on fluid levels. Two months later it became clear the spinal fluid was just not being absorbing and her ventricles were still enlarged. The pressure manifested as respiratory distress. She had lots of bradycardia and apnea episodes. Essentially her heart rate would drop and she would stop breathing. She was diagnosed with hydrocephalus and needed a vp shunt. The surgery was terrifying, but overall pretty quick. It took roughly an hour. She was transferred back to her NICU from the surgical hospital a few days later. What was great is how quickly the surgery produced results. She became markable better at breathing almost immediatly following surgery. She is had to have a few revisions now, but just celebrated her first birthday and shows no signs of developmental delays. Honestly the surgeries take more out of the parents than anyone. Kids are tough. Shunts are also pretty common and the surgeons who have done her initial shunt and subsequent revisions probably could not count the number of procedures they have performed. \n\nI know you are scared because I have very much been where you are. Make sure in your research to look for actual information and talk to your doctors. Pediatricians likely will not know as much as a neurologist. If you want to pm me or ask any more questions feel free.  Hey, rocksauce, just a quick heads-up:  \n**immediatly** is actually spelled **immediately**. You can remember it by **ends with -ely**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Yeah, that is a good idea. I was not able to be at the appointment where the neurologist explained the results of the MRI, so I got all the information from my wife. \n\nI just do not want him to have to live with a shunt, considering what I hear about the risk of infection and the need for replacement, etc. Thanks for your reply.", "Can anyone provide me with information or personal experiences with ETV? Feeling overwhelmed Hello fellow hydro and headache buddies! \n\n**tl;dr:** My neurosurgeon suggests an ETV and a shunt valve replacement.  Im concerned and would like to hear experiences with those that have had ETV surgery.\n\n\n **History:**\n\n\nAbout 3 years ago when I was 26 I started having headaches.  An MRI confirmed I had idiopathic hydrocephalus and I had a VP shunt placed shortly after that.  My ventricles went back to normal, but I have had a constant headache of varying degrees for 3 years.  I have a Codman Certas programmable shunt and I have been adjusted back and forth from 1-8 several times by several different Neurosurgeons.  No one has been able to find an answer for my constant headaches.   Ive been on what seems like a million different medications prescribed by my neurologist, but nothing works.\n\nMy current symptoms are a constant headache, minor balance problems, minor memory problems, very minor speech problems that come and go, sensitivity to light/sound/smell, and some problems with appetite/nausea.  This has all slowly gotten worse over the last 3 years.\n\n**My NS's suggestion:**\n\nThe NS I am currently seeing thinks that my shunt is not working correctly. He thinks the shunt is operating as an on-off shunt (Adjusting between 1-8 does not change the amount of CSF flowing, it is either on or off) and thus when it is on, I over-drain, and when it is off my ventricles fill up.  When it is on, my ventricles have been described as \"slit like\".  My NS turned off the shunt to see if I even needed the shunt anymore--I do need the shunt because my ventricles are now large.\n\nAt first he suggested a valve replacement along with adding an anti-siphon device. During our consultation I asked about an ETV because I heard others have had success with that. He said they could do that too and it might allow me to live shunt free.  \n\n\nSo if I understand his reasoning correctly...: He wants to do an ETV in addition to replacing the valve on my shunt, but leave the shunt in the off position to start.  That way, if the ETV fails he can turn on the shunt.  If I do well with the ETV, I can eventually have the shunt removed.  Has anyone had both of these surgeries done at the same time?\n\nSide note: I thought it was a little weird that my neurosurgeon didnt suggest an ETV until I brought it up.  Although I feel comfortable with my current NS, it left me wondering if I should look for a 2nd opinion.  \n\n**Concerns:**\n\nIm mostly concerned by how much more invasive an ETV is compared to just doing a shunt valve replacement.  Ive seen several posts saying that an ETV only made things worse for several reasons including causing memory problems.  \n\n\nI know that at the end of the day I need to listen to my neurosurgeons advice, but if anyone can provide helpful information or personal stories about their ETV it would be appreciated.  Ive been looking for an answer to my awful headaches for so long, but now that there is somewhat of a plan it feels like everything is moving so fast and is overwhelming. Hi! Sorry you are going through this. I was diagnosed late with hydrocephalus and had a non-programmable v-p shunt placed around your age at 20. For 11 years my shunt was overdraining but I did not realize that is why I felt sick. At 31, I had a revision with programmable valve because of the overdrainage. I continued to have symptoms because I made the mistake of staying with a neurologist who ignored my symptoms including double vision. In 2016, I found a new neurosurgeon who replaced the valve and did an ETV and turned the shunt off. (Prior to this, he thought that I did not need the shunt anymore and turned it off... within hours we realized I did.) After about 1.5 months post surgery, I felt AMAZING! I did not need any of my migraine meds anymore. I did not need Nuvigil or Adderall to stay awake. About 4 months later, my symptoms began to return. Fast forward 2 years to now, and my NS and I are considering the ProSa anti-siphon device. Like your brain, mine no longer seems to care what the shunt wants it to do. He thinks he can then turn the shunt off again and reproduce the amazing few months I had in 2017. \n\nTo summarize: \n\n1. Second opinions are good. There are many \u201cgood practices\u201d out there, and neurosurgeons are not all trained the same. If you get a second opinion and they tell you the same as your guy, then that might be reassuring. \n\n2.  I was begging for the ETV for 8 years before I got it. I would love to get rid of this thing in my head. I do it again in a heartbeat. Memory problems are transient as are any hormonal issues. Then again, Versed will cause anterograde amnesia, and I did not mind missing my cycle that month! \ud83e\udd23 \n\n3.  When I first discussed the ProSa with my NS, I left the appt having decided I was going to do it. I got home and realized I had so many more questions, and I needed him to explain it to me again. So I called and made another appt a month later. You could do that to. Go back with a list of questions. You could ask his opinion of how many of his patients have this or that symptom. In pre-op before the ETV, my NS told me his infection rate for patients. Do not be afraid to ask anything. \n\nGood luck. Keep us posted! I hope this helped! You could also talk to someone at the Hydrocephalus Association. Hydroassoc.com They are a great resource! Hi, I had a shunt places around the age of 12 and was replaced fully by an ETV at 24. The shunt was not left in in my case however, as it was blocked, and had already blocked several times before. My opinion is that ETV is a great treatment, and has a lot of benefits over shunts where they can be applied, so they are definitely worthwhile. I understand your apprehension about your doctor\u2019s opinion, though it is hard to know what viewpoint they are approaching it from. If you can get a second opinion easily I would probably go for it, I am in Canada though so we typically do not get much choice on that. The big thing I understood about my ETV though is that it is a more complex surgery involving more prep work, so they do not always jump to it, particularly if the NS is not well versed in it. Hope that helps! TL;DR: Addressing concerns: ETV is not more invasive nor does it have higher side effect risk than shunt surgery. I had an ETV and it did not change my daily headaches.\n\nTechnically, the shunt does not fully turn \"off\", even if that is the patient lingo the neuro uses to explain it. There is still residual fluid that will flow out upon high pressure, such as quick verticality or straining (abdominally). I understand the nature of the adjustable shunt -- it is not \"off\", even at the highest pressure setting. The only way for it to be \"off\" is to manually tie the tubing of the shunt via surgery so that no leakages can occur.\n\nSo even after the ETV, you will have to try resetting your shunt to the highest setting (previously called \"off\"), and if that is too high, other variable settings with your new adjustable valve. The ETV may not solve all your problems. It may help. It may do nothing. It may have long-term effects that are not fully studied yet, like disrupting the endocrine system as the third ventricle is close to the pituitary. You may still need to play the game of adjusting the shunt pressure to a happy level. \n\nIt is a popular newish procedure, and that gives a lot of hope to people that hate the imperfect solution of their shunt, who are suffering, and desperate to relieve their pain. Just realize that this is not a promise to get rid of your shunt. The risk of infection and further surgery risks to remove your shunt in the indeterminate future is likely to pressure your neurosurgeon to not operate to remove said shunt. Unless there is clear evidence to support the removal, after another surgery to tie it off.\n\nThe question to ask your neuro/s is the success rate of ETV for your particular brain anatomy/hydro cause. By idiopathic, do you mean NPH? For instance, ETV is favorable for aqueductal stenosis, but variable for an anatomical aberration ((  \nTheoretically, an ETV is a \"simple\" procedure ( as far as brain surgeries going with modern technology). Of course, there are still huge risks, I am not minimizing. But personally, an ETV was SO MUCH easier to recover from than a VP shunt, simply by less muscles cut (it is on top of the head rather than near the neck/awkwardly on a part of your head that you use to turn, sleep, etc.). It is just a drill hole through skull and through some membranes. It is less than 10 minutes (surgery, not recovery!). You personally will have to have a VP revision regardless, so ETV is not gong to add much in terms of invasiveness or recovery time. It is easier to get them done together. \n\nRe: your neurosurgeon: You have a malfunctioning shunt. It is overdraining too much (slit ventricles) or not enough (expanded ventricles). His advice is to add the anti-siphon to the new valve to limit overdraining. This builds upon what is already in your brain to try and fine tune the system. Your brain is relatively used to it, even if it is not working for you. A new procedure is more risky, and a responsible neuro tries to minimize risk. But he is open to an ETV as an option after you mentioned it, as well as still replacing your shunt. My non-medical advice: if you are prone to overdraining, *definitely* get the antisiphon on your new shunt, regardless if you get an ETV. It will prevent the siphoning of fluid, even if the shunt is on the highest setting.\n\nFood for thought.. Just contemplate how the other posters know that the ETV specifically is what caused more issues, rather than the extra trauma of surgery and other variable factors such as shunt setting? Do they all have shunts too? Correlation is not causation. Likely that the imbalance of CSF/pressure causes memory problems, not the ETV itself.\n\nMy experience: VP shunts for 22 years, post brain tumor hydro, have tried so many of the things, ran a hydro support group. We did try this ETV theory with my neurosurgeon with similar brain complaints as yours. My ventricles, however, are \"non-compliant\" and do not change much anymore (but we measure the fullness of intracranial pressure with severity and posture of headaches -- too low of pressure and slit-like ventricles is over-drainage, and too high and small ventricles is high pressure). I overdrained a lot, but tying off the shunt proves I still cannot drain on my own. The ETV effect was negligible. It was a check off the checklist of brain surgery options, and I got a cool video inside my brain. Also, good luck with your search for relief. Sorry, I get so caught up in the factual stuff that I forget the emotional impact. You are tracking well with a complicated situation. There are periods of relief, and you can find the right brain pressure balance. An adjustable shunt can theoretically help with this, and the ETV option might too. Here is to hoping! xx Hello, thank you so much for your reply. I am sorry that you are going through something similar as me. \n\n This was very helpful and definitely helped me feel a little less overwhelmed! :-)\n\nI am getting a second opinion this week!  Hoping for the best.\n\nThanks again.  Please keep me updated too Thank you so much for this.  I am sure this took a long time to type out and I want you to know I really appreciate it.  I have read over it a few times and im still trying to take it all in. I hope you dont mind if I message you, im sure ill have more questions as I get closer to having surgery.\n\n&gt;  By idiopathic, do you mean NPH? For instance, ETV is favorable for aqueductal stenosis, but variable for an anatomical aberration\n\nThey are unsure about what type or what caused it.  One NS called it idiopathic hydrocephalus.  Another NS said it could be aqueductal stenosis.  The latest is unsure what to call it.  :-/  Going to take some time to read through that link now.\n\nThanks again, I have a second opinion with a NS this week, im sure ill be referencing this post during the consultation haha :-)\n\n&gt;Also, good luck with your search for relief.\n\nYou too, it sounds like you have been through a lot.  No one should have to go through all this.  All the best, Thank you for your reply.  How long has it been since your ETV?  Was the ETV completely successful?  How do you feel now?\n\nThanks again It has been about five months since. ETV was completely successful on the first round. Now I feel back to normal, though I will say my mental headspace felt a little fuzzy for the first three months or so, and my memory took time to recover. My memory now is maybe just a touch off what it should be ( short term, not long term) so I can easily say I am back to normal. I feel much better not worrying about a shunt I could damage now. I have an ETV it is the only treatment I have had. I did not get diagnosed until I was 18, I am 40 and it has not let me down yet! *touch wood*. \n\nA few times we have been concerned due to symptoms but MRI's have never shown it closing. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nNote this is personal opinion but I think as adults ETV's are a great option! I feel like I read more about failures in children which makes sense as they are still growing! \n\nBest of luck! Sorry for the delay. I hope your second opinion appt went well. :-) Hi! I did not see your response until now, but sure definitely message me. Hopefully all these months later you have had an update and some sort of resolution?", "Is it generally true that shunts need less readjusting for people that are diagnosed when adults? I have been reading through the testimonials here for a while. It kind of seems that the people that needed lots of revisions on their shunts, surgeries, etc. have had hydro since they were children.\n\nIn my case, my mother (70yo) probably has hydro (need more tests to get an actual diagnosis, but seems likely), and I wonder if it is likely that it will be a one-and-done surgery, or whether it is not uncommon to have this be an ongoing issue over years. I had my shunt put in as a baby and ive never had a revision in my 35 years. Wow, congratulations! What kind of shunt do you have? Same, 37 years. Holter valve, VP shunt.

After giving the boss (actually, I have done this more than once) things change. Not that I am given special privileges (simply because I want to hold my own weight TBH) since the letter but it made the HR and my bosses realize that I was not joking about my condition.\n\nI am different than a lot of people. I do not consider my Hydrocephalus a disability, simply because I worked right up until a few years ago. Another thing is I do not consider it an invisible handicap. I graduated in the top 5 of my HS graduating class and graduated at the top of my nursing class. (I also have a BSN too.)\n\nI have serious headaches. I vomit A LOT....and yes, there are people that do not do as well as I do, I get and I am sorry. There have been times when I wished I had said more to my boss or HR but in the end, I am glad that I was able to work and do my job like everyone else.   \nI realize not everyone can do this.....and that is sad, really sad.

Yeah it is crazy that most people shrug off Hydrocephalus! It requires brain surgery to correct, and like was mentioned earlier comes with a whole slew of invisible side effects. \nI was shunted since I was 2 weeks old with a revision at 7 years old. I consider myself so lucky that I did not develop any major complications but I still managed to develop headaches, sporadic vision loss,ADHD, and Dyscalculia. \n\nFor so many of us we suffer in silence. That is why I was so happy to find this sub! We should be supporting each other! I also did well academically and I am doing well at work too after giving a letter from my neurosurgeon.

Even though I was not dx\u2019ed until later in life ( at 30 yrs old) I have seen others who have it so much worse then than I do. My neurosurgeon was the Professor &amp; Chair of the Dept of a large Michigan hospital.

Actually, she is a care-giver for her husband who has a severe seizure disorder!\u201d\n      When the appointment was nearing the end this amazing doctor smiled and said to me\u201d Do U realize what an absolute miracle U are?\u201d \n      Believe me when he learned that I was a RN in a large hospital ER, he was amazed.\n      I think that keeping my medical issues to myself unless asked has allowed me to live a very normal life, despite the severe headaches &amp; occasional vomiting issues.\nI would much rather have it this way, hands down. Sure sometimes it is not easy, but I think it is worth it. You see or hear about so many young people nowadays that seem to \u201cWANT so bad to be ill and live their life on SSDI or SSI it is sad.

I cannot feel more grateful to be where we are at now although, I know it is going to be a long road. I hope his surgeon knows how thankful I am that he chose to do his job, and chose to do it today. Someone can impact you in such a huge way and not even know. Be nice to everyone you see in public because you never know what there facing at home. I will forever be thankful for nurses and surgeons. Even if if it there job, they did not have to be here but they chose to. Sorry for the grammar and run offs I am really at a loss of words. Everything will be ay okay. I am glad you all took the right steps and got your son to the doctor. You are doing everything right. \n\nHang in there. Thank you\u2764\ufe0f he is much better today I am glad you got help for him as soon as you did, and that he is doing better. I think that is key with hydro symptoms, catching them early and getting them treated. I cannot even imagine how you are feeling. My parents tell me stories about when I was in the hospital as a baby. Luckily for you and your son, the technology is much better than it was 25 years ago. When I was little I had a shunt put in at 6 months and proceeded to get a revision every year from 1-5 years old. It will take some getting used to, being worried every time your son bumps his head. Just wait until he asks to play football! This is a very supportive community so if you need to talk you can reach out to any of our members. I am not sure if the severity of your sons case, but as a 24 year old functioning adult I can happily say the only problems I have with my shunt is that I cannot go scuba diving or ever go to space. Well wishes to you, your son, and your family! Had my first shunt put in 28 years ago and just had the valve replaced with a new programmable valve, much much smaller than the original. Technology has gotten so much better. Thank you\u2764\ufe0f I am glad your ok and are spreading kind hopeful words to others in the same situation it means so much I try to do what I can. I was a hydrocephalus baby born at 29 weeks. The doctors even told my parents there would either be a low chance of survival or low chance of a normal life so the fact that I am practically \u201cnormal\u201d is a blessing. Try to do what I can to comfort parents, they are the ones that suffer the most. I had surgery for mine at 5 months and I am 20 now! I still talk to my surgeon as he sees me for scoliosis now (which is surreal for both him and me lol) and I am sure your son\u2019s surgeon knows how thankful you are. Neurosurgery is hard but they do it for a reason! Glad your son is doing better. You will be amazed at how quickly your son is going to bounce back from this surgery. Kids are so super resilient. Good luck! I am here to tell you that everything will be okay. I was born with hydrocephalus and have had about 16 surgeries in total with a few near death experiences, I do not mean to scare or worry you, I am just trying to say that everything will eventually turn out to be okay. I will be praying for you, your son, and the doctors. I hope he gets better soon. Thank you\u2764\ufe0f he is doing much better I am very glad to hear that.

I was wondering if there are any Redditors in the 30s who have recently had to have a revision? What was your recovery time like? Did you experience symptoms differently than when you were a child (ie how do you know if a shunt has failed).\n\nHas anyone ever outgrown their need for a shunt?\n\nJust curious. Hope you are all having a great night. I am 41, but my last two revisions were 6 years ago at age 35.  The first revision was in late April and the second two weeks later in mid-May.  After that it took about two months for my energy levels to get back to normal. Prior to the revisions I would been getting tired more often. \n\nFor me every shunt failure has been different. This time, a week before the shunt failed for the first time I felt a sharp \"twinge\" and my vision blurred for a few seconds. After that, a few days before failure I started getting more intense headaches in the early morning that would go away after 45 minutes or so. I think the shunt suffered partial failure the week before and gradually got worse until it failed completely. Thanks for responding.\n\nDid you have to take much time off work? I mean was the level of fatigue such that you could not get out of bed, or like the morning after a big drinking session :)? I am very fortunate to have generous sick leave/vacation available so I actually took a month off work in total to recover from the two revisions.  I had a seizure the morning after the first revision which caused the first shunt to fail two weeks later.\n\nI would say the worst of the fatigue lasted about a week or two after the final revision. I recall sleeping a lot more and just generally being exhausted.  After that I was just tired, but still able to function relatively well.\n\nI cannot speak to the \"drinking\" analogy, two drinks is my limit and after a third I am pretty hammered. :) I am 32, and had mine put in when I was 10 weeks old in 1986. Never had a revision. My surgeon assumed that I had outgrown my need for it by around age 6 according to my medical notes.\n\nI am in the UK with the NHS and they do not seem to want me to bother them with checkups.

You do you know if it is broken? That is my question too! How do you tell the difference betweeen regular everyday headaches and malfunction headaches? \n\nMy last neuro (long since retired) used to use the expression \"let sleeping dogs lie\" all the time, so it must be something they learn at uni! I am getting my shunt removed in two weeks, with a possible replacement if he determines me to be shunt dependent. I had asked during my appointment what types of headaches and lethargy I would be experiencing if it were to be due to shunt failure. He described to me that a malfunction headache would feel like my skull is being ripped open or about to pop. In terms of lethargy he said it would be that somebody would be like violently shaking me and I would not respond and I would be unconscious for 20-24 hrs at a time.  Holy shit! Is falling unconscious a common side effect? It has not been my experience thank Dog. By \u201cfalling\u201d unconscious I mean going to sleep and not waking up for the next 20-24 hrs. Not trying to confuse you on it either. My neurologist (Muhonen, CHOC) described it to me and my dad by saying that I would not respond to violent shaking in an effort to wake me up, which was not my case thank the powers that be.  \nThe projectile vomiting I do remember well :) \n\nGood luck with the surgery.

I always find that with this fluctuation of weather I get these horrible headaches..does anyone else experience this?\n\nHopefully everyone is feeling healthy and staying safe Absolutely yes. I got a new programmable shunt a few years ago and this has been a symptom of mine ever since. Cold mornings that turn into hot days are the worst. I am sorry you go through this also but happy I am not alone. What are your coping mechanisms? Haha no worries, we are all in this together!\n\nNot much, really. Just remind myself that it is only temporary and try not to let my mind wander into thinking it could be a malfunction. \n\nI have been taking CBD oil for a few months now as well, it seems to help me with headaches and pains in general. Just my experience. I recently got my shunt replaced with a programmable shunt. For the past two years whenever it rains I have cognitive issues, trouble waking up and memory issues. I worked with my neurologist and surgeon to figure out solutions. It got so bad I could not go to work. \n\nTried lidocaine injections to dull some nerves in the back of my head monthly, along with some various medications. Nothing seemed to improve the weather based issues.\n\nFinally recently tried amovig, a cgrp injectable that has had the biggest effect on improving my quality of life. Im only on the first month but I would suggest bringing that up with your doctor if it is really debilitating. \n\nNote: not a doctor, just my very recent experiences. YMMV. I can tell you when a storm is coming. For whatever reason my head reacts to low pressure systems coming through. Makes my head just pound. It is normal. The rain messes with my shunt something fierce. I will definitely look into that! I appreciate you reaching out. Feels good to talk to someone who understands Exactly! That is what I fear. We know what it feels like for a malfunction but sometimes it is so close to compare. What is your go to CBD oil? Me too! Imagine living in Oregon and being able to feel when it is about to rain \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02 What do you do as a coping mechanism? Absolutely.\n\n I suffer from constant headaches and when the weather changes it gets worse. I went for a check-up recently (no issues, I just do an appt. ever 3 years) The doctor for some \"odd\" reason after being told for 30 yrs my ventricle size has not changed and most likely would not now claims that the ventricles are looking better??? RIGHT.....I am in the process of asking for copies of the last two CT-scans to compare them myself and take them to another neurosurgeon.  Why I think this doctor did this is questionable...and I want another opinion. I honestly do not think he believes my story about the severe headaches which IMO is bull-sh\\*t. I would love to have even 5 headache free days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Typically? Medicate. Ice packs. Heat packs. Not all of the time, but sometimes my headaches can predict a rain storm within the next 24 - 48 hours.", "Two shunts anyone? My 14 month old has managed to get himself two completely separate shunt systems. He has a blockage between the laterals and the 4th ventricle, and a blockage between the 4th and the spinal column (?) after a bleed on day 1 of life (28w+1). \n\nWe have went from having two connected catheters, which failed, to one catheter from fourth to laterals, which failed, to another two connected catheters, which failed. So now we have a catheter in the laterals with a port and tubing, and the same in the fourth. \n\nHis original tubing has detached and is floating around his abdomen, and he has two tubes running down the other side. His x-rays are a riot. \n\nAnyone else have a system like this? I have heard differing opinions as to the scenario of another failure. One being if one blocks, the other one continues to drain meaning no internal swelling. I mentioned that to his nurse and she looked at me funny. Not me, but I have met people on fb that has two, or even three shunts. Seen people with two ,usually one blocks they have issues. I do not have multiple shunts but mine has been removed and all the tubing is still in from my sternum down to my hip, and it wanders around in my hip/groin. Fun stuff. Good luck on your journey. I am way late to this thread, but I had two shunts running simultaneously from the age of 18mo til I was 22 (late 30's now). My hydro presented as multiple pockets of fluid, and as such - one shunt was inadequate. I had a 3rd added at 22 because the others had stopped working, but have been in so long that the scar tissue buildup would mean more trouble to remove them than leave them there.", "Why is awareness important? ", "Abdominal pain next to scar Hi everyone,\n\nI got my VP shunt when I was 6 months old. I am now 32 and have never needed my shunt to be changed.\n\nHowever, for almost 2 years I have been experiencing sharp pain in my abdomen very close to my VP shunt scar. \n\nIt hurts when I lie down or get up, or when I stretch my back. It does not happen 100% of the time but certainly almost every day.\n\nI went to see the neurosurgeon last year, I got an MRI and everything seemed to be right according to them. I have enough cable and everything. They said that my shunt could be calcified and that could be causing the pain but that they were not sure and I would need exploratory surgery, with all the risks that entails.\n\nI thought it was not worth the risk but now I am not sure anymore. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar?\n\nThank you very much!", "Neck stiffness and spinal stenosis So I have been feeling a lot of confusion and memory loss lately. I am performing poorly at my job in education. I went to my neurologist to figure things out. I have a bulging disc which is bringing me pain and soreness in my neck. I have 3 shunts. Has anyone here already had nph and then developed spinal stenosis after? I feel like I am just deteriorating. I suspect I have this. I have one shunt, arthritis and something is up with my back. I do get massive headaches but it starts off with back pain, then wishing in my ears following by eye watering headaches.\n\nI am on baclofen for my cp but I have had an mri, ct scans\u2026nothing is wrong so they say\n\nBut now I feel like I have to pee all the time.\n\nDoctors just did blood work; healthy. No diabetes. So\u2026", "Has anyone here ever been at risk at for being denied shunt surgery because of frequent (once or twice a week) consumption of alcohol? I drink no more than a 6 pack on my day off, and then a no more than a few if I eat someone that has beer. I have been told that this could be an issue, but I do not know that this has happened to other thana very heavy drinker. What is your location? I am in the US and I have had 19 shunt revisions now 27 years, all of them being emergency. They asked how often I drank and I told them the truth, 1-2 a day maybe a sixer on the weekend. I have never been denied surgery and I have no idea why you would be denied surgery. It is not like it is an elective surgery like plastic surgery. These shunt surgeries have to happen no matter what. Are you seeing a revision surgery soon in your future and your worried about your alcohol consumption between now and then? With brain surgery comes the risk of brain bleeds. Alcohol thins the blood. Once a shunt is places you are at a higher risk of brain bleeds. Any neurosurgeon worth a darn will tell you not to drink alcohol. Ever. It is not worth it.  I am also in the US. I have been told that it is any surgery, not just for hydrocephalus. My friend's Mom was denied cancer surgeries because of alcoholism. Yes, I am seeing a revision surgery soon, and yes I am worried about alcohol consumption.  To be honest, what you are describing does not scream 'alcoholism' to me.\n\nIf you said you drank most nights after work and it was 4 or 5 pints (half litres) of beer, and then had a six pack on your days off then maybe.", "Kind Of worried I am 26/m and have hydrocephalus and I have had mine checked before, when I was younger, but some days I get headaches and a small vibration near my shunt. Now that I am older should I get mine check to see if it is working properly? How long has it been since you have seen a Neurosurgeon? If it is been over 4-5 yrs an appointment would not hurt most likely. Only saw one when I  was younger but not since I have become older", "scared for surgery!!! My neurosurgeon called me today with a surgery date of October 25 at 10:30am \nI am beyond terrified. How did you feel after surgery? Did you have any complications of any sort? How long was it until you felt normal again? And when did you finally return to work? What type of surgery are you getting done? ETV or shunt placement? And which state? You will be fine. I have taken my child when she was a premature infant to have a couple surgeries. On one hand I was terrified. On the other I was sitting next to another family of a child and we were all surprisingly calm. Why? Because it is a shockingly common procedure and the surgeons are quite good at it. I cannot ease your feelings but I can say that it is something they are incredibly good at. You will be fine! Honestly the best advice I can give is not having your cellphone or laptop for the first day or two after surgery. Just had a revision a couple years ago and man did I order some weird stuff in amazon while on painkillers. Just watch some Netflix lol \n\n Unsure how hospitals work right now during covid but it is normal for nurses to check on you a lot during the night. You will sleep when you get home lol.\n\nAlso if your scar hurts when you lay down on a pillow, try wearing a knit winter hat and turning up the ac. The wool cap was a huge lifesaver for me a couple surgeries ago. I just got a cheap one from Target since it did get some blood/stuff in it as you slept. I felt peaceful. Relieved. Strangely.  Go easy on yourself for a week I am recently out of ETV surgery (9/13) and am still convalescing at home until I return to work on 11/1. I belong to a hydrocephalus chat group and received the advice to take it easy after the surgery even though you will be feeling better. Take the recommended down time. This person had to go back into the hospital and was set back 2 months. I have had 30 shunt revisions with only 1 of them being a scheduled surgery. After every one of them, I have felt relief because my headache was gone. For the first couple of days after, I find myself being tired easier and taking naps during the day. For my last shunt revision, I had surgery on October 29 and went back to work on December 1 and felt normal by then. 30 revisions? Omg! You poor thing! I hope you are doing well and stay surgery free from now on! Thank you for your kind works. I just take it one day at a time. I thank every one of you for your updates and comments. My surgery was post posted until a later date due to emergencies at the hospital. But I will definitely be taking advice from you guys. I feel somewhat better about the surgery after reading all the comments. Sorry I could not give a update any sooner. Work has me very busy, and just my life in general is very hectic. I am not to sure? The neurosurgeon told me that they would be removing the entire shunt hardware which is the tube that goes the to abdominal area, the actual VP shunt itself and some sort of tube that goes into the brain? If that makes sense lol Wow 30? That is crazy. I am not to sure how many revisions I have had in my younger days but have not had a single surgery since around the age of 4", "Advice needed: I have bad PTSD from my shunt surgeries. Hey all: I wonder if anyone has advice that has a shunt. I have had mine since birth for a cyst. \n\nStarting in 5th grade, I got ungodly, terrible headaches. Puking, the whole nine yards. Almost lost my vision. Finally we knew my shunt must not be working. \n\nThe shunt has failed in total 6 times in over 15 years. The last one from a car accident and my neck had whiplash. I automatically felt my neck and my shut split in two under my skin. \n\nI was freaking out, but the symptoms (headaches) did not come until 5 months later and they came with a vengeance. Worst month of my life so far. \n\nMy question. How can I stop worrying and lower my anxiety with shunt failures? Every pain near my neck, head pain etc. it is driving me crazy - but as you know, shunt replacements do not happen unless you are in agony (Atleast for me) Just curious, what happened the other times the shunt failed?\n\nI have a VP shunt as well placed at birth for a cyst. I had a revision when i was 13 to lengthen the tubing and I recently had a revision last month from the tubing getting clogged. First one it was clogged at the catheter from CSF. Whenever it clogs = instant high pressure headaches. But that first surgery took forever to figure out. Tried diamox first and nothing work. So we did surgery and I was good as new right after. It got clogged again a year later. I am assuming this was due to my shunt being close to 18 years old. \n\nThen three surgeries in three weeks about five years later. They replaced the main value (another part) in the first surgery, then put two catheters in my brain ventricles for more drainage in the next two surgeries. Just because fluid was still building up/not draining fast enough. \n\nThe latest surgery was due to the part of the shunt under the valve, which has not been touched/replaced ever. They replaced that since the shunt broke from my accident. My neck kind of whip to the side and it cracked. I automatically said \u201cshit\u201d and thought I was going to get an instant headache. Did not, but symptoms slowly appeared months later. \n\nNOW - the only part of my shunt that has not been replaced is in my abdomen. However, doctor says that they do not even remove it because for how longs it is been in my abdomen, it is so calcified it would break into so many pieces if they try to remove it. Wow. It is like you are writing about me-when I was diagnosed and treated for multiple shunt revisions, I even ended up in a coma a couple times.  \n\nI am 40 now, and have high anxiety due to my surgeries, good news is I have managed to live a normal life.  You should visit with a doctor and psychologist soon, talk-therapy is tremendously helpful and necessary if you have anxiety/PTSD.  \n\nSend me a note, I have loads to share with you. That cloud does not really go away. I think knowing that brain surgery is the only treatment of our condition is really life changing and difficult to deal with. For me, I find comfort in knowing that even if I am needlessly worrying, I take mental inventory of how my body is doing at all times. Obviously all the symptoms are red flags, but every little thing I keep track of just in case more things come up. (An accurate timeline of symptoms can help you get medical help as fast as possible, and helps you feel like you are doing your part of staying healthy) \n\nAnother thing I will add is that honestly I fluctuate between feeling like nothing I do will matter especially because of my various disabilities and conditions.. but I have also found the courage to look to the future. The PTSD does not really subside and to this day, I still have trouble falling asleep just running through lists of all the things I need to do. Other nights I have recurring hospital stay nightmares. It is really a mixed bag and with a prognosis like ours, I think it is normal to have a wide range of emotions in response. It is okay to feel hopeless, but it is also okay to feel gratitude, ambition, and hope. Hey friend, \n\nIt appears we are in similar boats. I had mine placed around 5th grade as well and have had an additional 11 surgeries from the original. \n\nThese past two months I have been fighting with my neurosurgeon about me having headaches and then trying to push me off to headache neurology when I was confident they were intracranial pressure related. Turned out there was a clot in the distal end of my catheter and it was pressure headaches all along. \n\nI guess my advice is, trust yourself and trust your pain. If the pain is not fucking awful, it is probably not a failure until it is fucking awful. \nAdvocate for yourself because doctors, while they are on your team, are also playing for a hospital, which is a business, and the bigger the price tag on the service, the more their boss wants them to do.  If you are hurting, do not stop bugging them until you stop hurting. \n\nGo to therapy. I have just started to deal with my ptsd as well. Seems to be helping but idk yet. \n\nShit sucks, and I am sorry you have to deal with it. But deal with it head on and just trust that you know your body. Shunt surgeries are tough. But you are tougher. Remember that. Nothing can fathom your will to thrive and be normal even though the shunt should be a burden, but it is not.\n\nYou are Stronger. Believe in yourself and drinking water upon rising. You can do this. So i recently had my shunt revision due to the distal catheter being clogged (the one that goes to your abdomen). You are correct, they do not remove this. They also replaced the valve with a programmable one which is much smaller. I too was undiagnosed for a year and was put on Diamox.\n\nBefore this happened, i did BJJ and kickboxing for about three years, I am also a skydiving coach. I never even think about my shunt anymore, not until I had to. I went fifteen years without a single issue with mine and now it is fresh on my mind (no pun intended) lol. Has anyone discussed with you why yours has been prone to get clogged? The car wreck was an accident, but VP shunts are typically pretty resilient.\n\nI am not an expert on shunts, but I have a great neurosurgeon that is extremely open with communication. This made it a little easier on me. It is something that I have learned to live with. It is something that is always in the back of my mind. When I do get headaches, I just take Tylenol or Advil and take a nap. When I wake up and the headache is still there, I know that it is shunt related. My only symptom of shunt failure is a headache that will not go away. I am 29, just had my 29th revision and I am at my NS now for my checkup for my last revision that was on October 30. awesome response! definitely after my surgeries, pain, and hospital stays - my outlook on life is definitely different from people I have met. I take things less seriously, enjoy each day (without pain), and have more fun. My main goal was to find a partner that I can spend life with, but to also know he will take care of me and be the one who will spend hours if need in an ER room they really didnt give me a reason for it clogging. i also have slit ventricle syndome (to add to the list) and chiari malformation. however, i played college basketball and basketball for 15 years still. no issues, but did develop partial seizures, which i assume develop over the course of the surgeries. i just start into space Amen!! I hate spinal taps lol I understand. Keep on keeping on, you sound like a trooper for sure. this is 100% correct. i think the fear comes mostly from my last revision. it was fucking awful. i went to the ER after a day of absolute nauseating pain. the hospital would not operate on the weekend so i had to throwup/lay in pain for three days. no meds would help, except **fentanyl** which i could only get in the operating room. \n\ni just need to stop thinking about the future and \"what if\" that would happen again. since my shunt can only be replaced if i get that type of headache it is so nice to know there are people that are exactly like me!! we are in this together. shunt failures suck ass, but we need them to keep us pain free. I am praying for you and lots of love &lt;3 Hi- my son has hydro and the doc did an ETV.  23 have to go for follow up Bc he is still showing signs that something is not right. He might need a full shunt. He throws up in the morning. Curious- you mentioned drink water when you wake up? Does that help with the nausea ? Thanks so much. Fursure. \n\nAnd I guess my second piece of advice too is to know when to live. So trust yourself that you know your pain, and then when you are not in that pain, fucking live and do whatever. Because you and I both know, in an instant, that goodness can be snatched away and life goes to shit again. So do not let it depress you, let it liberate you. I am the new guy on the block (1st shunt put in last week for obstructive hydrocephalus) so I do not know how much my 2 cents are worth but towards the end (right before surgery) there was a sharp decline in cognitive function, slurred words, body tremors, trouble with balance, definitely a noticeable difference, what helped me the most was keeping a journal and writing in it daily.  Even if it was a few words about how I was feeling that day that way I could go back and chart my decline, towards the end it was scary and I am glad I did it.  Now I write in it daily just to keep track of my moods and thoughts, things have been slowly getting better, hope this helps. I have heard of an ETV procedure, and I have never had to cross that road before with my treatment plan.\n\nHowever, whenever my shunt failed, the only thing to supress the symptoms (nausea, tinnitus, dizzy, fainiting, headaches) was surgery - and that was to fix the shunt. And therefore fixing the shunt was due to some blockage OR was because too much CSF fluid was building up in my brain (taking forever to drain to abdomen). Once the shunt was put in, drained the fluid, it is legit immediate relief.\n\nso to answer your question - water doesnt really do much. pain medicine didnt really help me either. just surgery. that is great advice and I appreciate your thoughts. I hope and pray your shunt last a long time! Thank you, likewise I honestly was always scared to commit to someone seriously because of all my health problems and the uncertainty of my future. But love ended up finding me and we fit perfectly. Coincidentally he is also on his way to becoming a nurse and has caregiving and patience in his nature :) \n\nHaving a partner with no physical ailments also helps with day to day anxiety, because as long as he is okay I will be okay too. Hope you find/have also found a partner who understands this side of your life and takes care of you! Thank you!!", "Chronic Headaches I have had a shunt placed at birth and about 16 surgeries from then until now along with an ETV. I have recently been having chronic headaches that neither my neurologist nor my neurosurgeon know the reason behind. I have tried almost ever medicine out there and none help. I was wondering if anyone else was having this issue or at least one similar. What do they feel like? I have had \u201cheadache scares\u201d meaning I THINK it is my shunt and am a day away from going to the ER. Then, I brainstorm and think WTF could be causing this headache. Because for me, I do not get headaches unless my shunt is broken. \n\nOver the years, these are reasons why IVE HAD headaches not related to my shunt:\n\n- Hungover, alcohol related next day\n- Some types of melatonin pills (this was tricky to figure out and I found a melatonin pill that did not give me headaches)\n- Dehydrated - I drink a gallon of h20 a day\n- Stressed from work or in general\n- A medicine interaction gone wrong (maybe I took allergy medicine with cold medicine too close to my regular medicine)\n- Sore back/neck muscles\n- Sinus congestion/allergies \n\nGood luck!! The only possible causes out of the list you have me are dehydration and sinuses. However, I drink about 2-2.5 gallons a day so I do not think that is the issue either. Also, whenever I go to the doctor they never say anything about my sinuses. Did they do any scans? Scans may show enlargement of your brain ventricles (if the pressure inside your skull aggravates them) unfortunately scans cannot really show brain pressure (that could be the cause of your headaches)\n\nYou could suggest an Intracranial Pressure Monitor for 48hr. It is not very comfortable, but if you are having headaches, it can measure the pressure inside your skull and see if maybe you should have your shunt replaced. \n\nMaybe the catheter is clogged, the value is malfunctioning. But always remember - you know your body. YOU know you are experiencing pain. I have experienced convos with doctors that downplayed my pain, so I needed to be persistent to get or find a solution. \n\nYou got this, and I hope you find an answer. Headaches suck. This. I do not drink alcohol and make sure I drink at least a gallon of water a day because whenever my head hurts I assume shunt and want to make sure I am not jumping to shunt problems just because I did not have enough water. My coworkers mock me for constantly drinking water but you got to do what you got to do Triple-shunted w/'Chronic daily head pain' since puberty here. We tried almost everything narcotic and some opioids within the migraine/occipital neuralgia/cluster headache sphere between the age of 15 and when I said 'no more' around the age of 30. Since then I have used medical marijuana on a daily basis.  It has cut ER trips caused by suspected shunt failures (last one presented as such) from about five times a year to twice in the last five. Has your doctor asked you to keep a headache diary? They have done all of that and still do not know what is going on. I drink about 2 or more gallons a day. Yes, I kept one for a few months but saw no correlation or patterns with the headaches. I have considered that, my neurosurgeon also suggested this \u201cprocedure\u201d type thing where they put me under for a while and it is supposed to be like a \u201chard reboot\u201d for my body. A fair amount of people have said it works but I just never got around to doing any of this. When was your last MRI?  Everything look ok there? I recently had a spell with chronic headaches, thinking I was overdraining between my ETV and shunt. Got some scans, everything looked normal but I kept pressing because of the pain I was in. Turns out, my shunt catheter was clotted and my ETV was doing all the leg work when I needed both the shunt and the ETV for comfort. \n\nDo you take a daily aspirin? If not, maybe ask for a shunt patentcy examination. It is just a shunt tap plus a scan so, to me, it sounds like a better option than the hard reboot. \n\nOther than that, medicinal marijuana or black market marijuana depending on your state. \n\nI hope you find some relief soon, friend. My last MRI was a few months ago and they said everything looked fine. I have done the shunt tap and the scan, I do not take any aspirin or any other medication because none of it works for more than a few minutes. I was going to try the marijuana or other grub before COVID. Thank you. There are many remedies for ( Some include supplements, trigger point injections, acupuncture, chiropractic care, botox injections, medications, stretches and exercises, diet changes, and more. Most headaches are idiopathic, which means were not sure where they come from. Locate the cause first by keeping a headache journal. The more information you have the better you can locate the cause and then proceed with the best remedy.", "I finally met someone else who has hydrocephalus! Ok, so it probably sounds really paltry, but I finally met someone else who has hydrocephalus and we spent like an hour exchanging stories and grievances about symptoms, people who do not understand, and daily life with hydrocephalus! It felt so good to learn that a lot of my symptoms matched theirs and I was not crazy. I would love to find someone else..now youre motivating me to post a search request. The other person actually goes to the same school (and my mom teaches there) and knew that I had \"something\" (idk if they knew it was hydro) because they were talking to my mom about their experiences at their hospital, which was a different one to the one I go to. I did not know they had it until my mom brought it up and I instantly wanted to connect with them to rant/talk about our experiences. I only knew of one other person with a shunt when I was growing up, but after I moved to my current city for school I found a hydro support group... but 80% of the group were either NPH patients or they had hydro as a result of something else (spina bifida or acquired as a result of trauma) so I have still only met 1 or 2 others that have had similar circumstances to myself - I have not met anyone else with multiple shunts yet, nor have I found anyone that deals with chronic headpain like I do. I also suffer with chronic headaches, but so does my mom (no hydrocephalus for her tho) so it is a little bit easier on that end. I am mentoring/hanging out with a Junior Higher with it. I was the second person that one of Sisters dated that has hydrocephalus but the other guy was far less mature, and did not stick around after. I would not have either if it was not for the kid. Despite it being a prevalent condition as far as conditions go, it is still rare but always welcome to meet one in the wild. Also,  we do not always exhibit clear and obvious outward symptoms. It is so hard to find anyone because it is not obvious in the least! I have definitely taken that for granted with the advent of social media. I remember feeling like the only person who had it, but it turned out I went to elementary school with at least 3 other kids who had it (2 of them from the same family) and found at least one girl in my high school who had it. And in college, I met a girl who had it but we did not know until a mutual friend of ours found out we both had it and decided to introduce us! It is always really exciting finding someone with hydro \u201cout in the wild.\u201d Yeah! That is why I take part in the walk-a-thons and events held by the local chapter. Looking forward to them post-COVID. I know nobody outside of this subreddit besides myself with hydrocephalus", "Baby getting shunt today, what should I know? Our 3 month old has been battling hydrocephalus for the past few months. It looked like it was solving itself, but unfortunately it came back and a shunt is going to have to go in.\n\nI know a decent amount about the short term, but what should we know about the long term to keep him happy and healthy? After baby grow up, you should let him/her know that he/she is okay with the shunt. The shunt would not make him/her a freak. (Focus: Please just tell him/her everything about his/her illness. Do not keep any secrets about it from your baby. Key let him/her to understand.)  Your cannot do vigorous sports. During the sports, the tube might be broken. Especially sit-up. Measure his head, every day. \n\nMy son is just over 1 year post op, you do not have to treat them like porcelain. \n\nAlso cradle cap over their shunt is a bitch, best to use an adult fine tooth comb to go over it with Long term, remember they are also a normal kid:\n \n* headaches can be normal headaches; you will notice behavioral changes along with the \"bad\" type of headache. \n* sports are fine (with approval from their neurosurgeon)\n* be careful when brushing their hair; you are not going to do damage, but it hurts. \n* unless there are other conditions at play, there is nothing extra\n\nThe shunt is made of a silicone elastomer, it is very resilient and is not as delicate as some people think it is. I am a mechanical engineer with an emphasis in material science and I have been shunted since 2 months old. I have done jujitsu for 21 years, I ride roller coasters, I have been scuba diving (down to 20ft) and sky diving all with my NS's blessing. Each case is, of course, unique but do not take any advice beyond that of a Neurosurgeon for what your child cannot do. I was wondering why you were getting down voted until that last sentence.\n\nEach case is unique and what you said about sports makes no sense. I have been weightlifting, climbing and swimming for the past 37 years and never had any issues. Only surgery I had was to expand the tubing when growing up. We taught our daughter from a very young age that her shunt is part of her. I doubt she knows it is a medical device, but it is very important for her to be able to tell us of it hurts or feels weird. As for normalcy, I did not know multiple people in my life have had than because I never directly felt it, and their hair covered it up. It is a pretty invisible condition. I think it is important to own your bodily weaknesses the same way we do our strengths. No single person is perfect in all ways. Some of us wear glasses, have asthma, or a myriad of other issues. Everyone is got them so you may as well use a shunt as a teachable moment. Kids who have them are often preemies and are pretty tough as is. \u2022 Write your questions down for your doctors. They are hard to remember between visits. \n\n\u2022 Plan your insurance accordingly. When they are little (under the age of 2) they are more likely to have shunt issues, but also you will be sent to the ER for pretty much anything remotely shunt like. \n\n\u2022 It is really stressful at first. Very very stressful, but it gets much easier. I often forget my kid has hydrocephalus. She is a mostly normal kid who has more check ups than your average kid. \n\n\u2022 Shunt surgeries are pretty routine. They are scary every time, but common none the less with very good outcomes. \n\n\u2022 Hydrocephalus should not effect the life span of your child at all. I do not know why a lot of people give my comment multiple likes. It might some wrong expressions in the comments caused by not working well phone. I did not mean that your baby is an freak just with an shunt. What I really mean is the shunt inside his/her body may make him/her feel weird and that might fluence your baby's psychological condition. When I got an shunt when I was young, my parents almost did not tell me anything about it. So when I feel bad and I only know I just had an surgery when I was too young then I feel really weird about myself and also my body.  I can learn that you are an good parent via reading your comments. And I really do not hope that happened to me will not happen to your kid. If the comment makes you feel offensive, I am sorry. Did you do sit-ups after you did the surgery? The tube inside of my body got broken was caused by doing too much sit-ups. If you guys can do these sports without any consequences, I am admiring you for having this such good physical condition. I did another twice surgery after the tube were broken.(I did four times in my entire life) And they are not successful. I often feel strongly headaches and because of this I cannot go to school to learn the lessons I suppose to learn. I just do want that same thing happened to me will happen to that baby. You are not offending me. I was just commenting along with you. Honestly it sounds like your English and grammar may cause a few comprehension issues. I would not sweat it. You clearly seem like a positive person to me. Yeah, I am not living in an English speaking country. Keep your baby hydrated all the time. Limit any and all screen time. Lack of hydration and increased screen time can cause headaches/migraines. Best wishes to you and your baby and family today and always. Jujitsu is safe or you need to limit the intensity ? i always thought i needed to avoid it due to neck twisting and risk of breaking the shunt There are definitely a couple throws that I cannot be thrown for safety reasons (not that they are inherently risky to the shunt, but risky if something were to go wrong); but it is primarily pulling motions or anything that could dislodge the shunt. Blows to the head are generally not good for people without shunts too, so protecting ones head is always important. When I work out with a new person, I always tell them what to avoid and I make sure the sensei is aware as well.\n\nIf neck twisting within your normal range of motion were enough to break the shunt, it would break every time you turn your head. It is a fairly resilient material. If you are in the US, you can get ribbons made of old shunt tubing from the Hydrocephalus Association and play around with them.\n\nAs I mentioned, do not do anything \"risky\" without the blessing of your NS, but in 21 years I have had no serious injuries and no issues with the shunt that were related to jujitsu.", "I have a blog that I started out by expressing the non-medical side of growing up with hydrocephalus. My topics eventually expanded. I have taken a long hiatus, but let me know if you have any topic ideas or if you want to write a guest blog post.  I would be willing to write a guest blog post. I have only had a total of 3 surgeries in the twenty years of my life--I am very lucky and privileged by this--but the last one was this summer and was because I developed bacterial meningitis, which was about as fun as it sounds.\n\nI would also love to talk about how people treat you differently when they know you have had brain surgery (especially recent brain surgery). I can send you my e-mail via PM so you can send it to me when you are done.

So I am 20 and I have *had* hydrocephalus since I was born premature by 3.5 months and had a bad brain bleed and  had a shunt put in shortly after, now I say *had* because I am not sure whether or not it still effects me today as I have never had any replacements or adjustments to my knowledge. I have never really thought about it much til I had a surgery on the other side of my head to remove a benign tumor in a hunk of my skull. Things for me after that were weird, I started questioning if I was normal or if I had mental issues because before that surgery I never really questioned or thought about the long term issues or anything like that afterwards my perspective really changed. I had questions about possible mental health issues caused by having a shunt and bad brain damage like that, because to my knowledge I never should have walked talked or lived for that matter, but here I am, I am a firefighter for Pete's sake, lol so not really struggling on that front, but I am depressed and have been for awhile now but for the longest time I thought it was just depression and never thought that it could have been caused by the shunt, or brain damage before it was put in but I dunno. It is just been on my mind for awhile, so thanks in advance. Definitely seek out professional therapy. Should be covered under your insurance no doubt.  Regardless of the causes of your depression you should seek out ways to help alleviate the symptoms with the help of a professional. For what it is worth, our neurologist said the part of the brain they go through to implant the shunt should not have any lasting effects.  I second this.\n\nI had my first shunt placed at 22, seemingly out of nowhere and it messed with me for a long time.\n\nIt is easy to grow numb and lose hope when going through something so tramatic. It took me years to believe that I was not going to suddenly keep over and longer to shake the related depression.\n\nFind someone professional to talk to, even if it is not something you feel comfortable with. I have depression and anxiety. Little did I know that both would hit me right in the face after 4 surgeries and a shunt. But they did. The best thing I ever did was check myself in for help. That is unfortunate that you had both, and hydro &amp; tumor are not necessarily related at all. Not a doctor, so not ruling out potentials. Having neurological trauma is not indicative of \"mental issues\" -- certain damaged areas can cause changes, yes. But on the whole, if you have gone through school without distinct learning disabilities, or made it as a fireman without physical disabilities, or caused alarm with mental instability, it seems your infant traumas healed up pretty well. \n\nAnd on the hydro diagnosis sites, or a brain tumor site, or really any medical trauma, depression or mental struggle post-surgery is expected. However, as someone with both tumor (removed) and hydro &amp; multiple surgeries, I argue that imbalanced CSF does change mental/emotional state *in flux*. When CSF is rebalanced, whether by medical intervention or lifestyle adaptation, mood and health rebalance (my argument, not fact).\n\nHowever, if your depression has cropped up after your tumor surgery, I would surmise it is related to that -- it is a big deal! You are not broken, the shunt does not mean you have got mental health issues. So yes, like the others said, go talk to someone, therapy is very useful in navigating these things!  \n\nIF you have, or develop, other symptoms ALONG with depression, e.g. increased headaches, nausea, blurry vision, balance disruption, then get your shunt checked. Still not a mental health issue, it is physical, and can have emotional effects because we are human. ", "ETV as an adult, after having multiple shunts, possible slit ventricle syndrome?

There have been no problems that I am aware of and two MRI scans I had done 1 and 2 years ago showed no problems with the shunt. However, I am experiencing severe fatigue, memory loss, depression, and irritability that two neurologists I am seeing cannot figure out. I was wondering, is there something my neurosurgeon might have forgot to tell me about meningitis? Just frustrated and do not know what questions to ask to figure this out. Could they do other testing other than an MRI? there is a lot of other tests that can be done to see if a shunt is running or if you have intracranial pressure. You could have an eye exam done to check your optic nerves. You could have a shuntogram done to check if the top of the shunt is drawing fluid. You could have intracranial pressure monitoring done although this is admittedly more invasive.", "Being evaluated for NPH (F, 20)\nI see a urogyn for bad overactive bladder with urge incontinence in the form of leakage and I did not respond to meds.

Let me know in comments if you would like to get a regular stream going &amp; I will make it happen. I would but I stopped streaming myself bc I cannot stand Twitch and I thought of doing podcast stuff within a few years. Glad to see more livestreaming bc it seemed like I was the only one streaming on it 6 years ago almost though as I could not find anyone else on it!

Anyone know of studies on the cognitive affects of hydro depending on severity? Personal stories help too!\n\nI got hydro at 23 from a rare bout of fungal meningitis. \n\n(8 week hospitalization, w/ headaches and temporary vision loss before shunting and a year of high dose steroids + anti-fungals) \n\nTo everyone I know my cognition is exactly the same with or without hydro. But I want to be prepared in the case of shunt failure. I mean when I was in the hospital for 6 weeks for continuous shunt failure, I felt pretty dumb but that was probably the amount of drugs and the brain hemorrhage and not the extra pressure exerted by the CSF. I also never really felt dumber on a normal surgery though, so you should be good. (I was the first person that went to that practice which is rather large  that had the hemmorhage thing happen, so you should be good!) I know when I was younger I went to one of the hospitals in the GTA to determine and help improve my motor skills and other cognitive functions. I do not know if to what degree it helped. Especially since many symptoms associated with hydrocephalus are related to Dandy Walker Syndrome. For example poor motor skills, issues with hand eye coordination, and speech delay. All of which I still have varying levels of issues today and I am soon to to be 37yo. Personally I would like to think I have done well for myself. I know it helped having the specialists that I had. As well as my family working with me to aid in my development. I hope this helps. For the majority of my surgeries I would temporarily have mild short term memory loss (could not remember the previous week) and I would temporarily loose I.Q points to the point I was like a 10 year old (that lasted about a day or two after the surgery). However, there have been no long-lasting cognitive effects. Best gage is grades harder to detect later on.  Best way i can describe is brain fog for a time where everything you do is forgotten. Like forget things you did unless prompted. That is usually bc  i was distracted by pain. Like you were on your phone playing a game but trying to pay attention. Just the game is pain. \n\nPerspective of the time prior to a revision I had obstructive hydrocephalus for several years because of a brain tumor and was misdiagnosed over 5 times. I remember hearing the surgeon tell my parents that only a week or two more and i would have died. The only thing i have noticed is that my hand-eye coordination is SLIGHTLY below average and that is probably because of the tumor, considering it took me 2 months to be able to stand on my own feet. I do not think it will do much unless you let the situation get out of hand for whatever reason.", "I am terrified please help me I have been having issues for about a year and a half now. Well i had a brain MRI yesterday and something came up. My CFS doctor called me right now and says I have fluid build up in my brain and to immediately figure out when to get surgery for it. I do not know how to feel or say. Just that Im terrified and overwhelmed. I have felt like ive been slowly dying since march. Getting better from my worse point, but staying stagnant. I had a feeling something was off for a while, and had a feeling the mri would come up with something. And now that it has, I just dont know how to go about it. \n\nI used to do boxing so Im assuming that and getting sick on and off for a while in 2019 contributed to this. I just need reassurance everything is okay. Or at least tell me what to expect. Putting in a shunt is a routine procedure at this point.   I box (just with a heavy bag) and I have had hydrocephalus since 2007.  You will have a surgery with an incision in your head and most likely your abdomen.  The incisions will be sore for a bit but otherwise you will be fine.  Assuming this is your first shunt you will probably get a programmable valve which allows the doctors to adjust your pressure without surgery if you are still having headaches/feeling bad.\n\nPlease feel free to DM me if you have anymore questions. It is a relatively common thing, do not worry! If my shunt has stayed fine for 37 years without failure and was put in with the archaic technology of back then, imagine how seamless it should be now.\n\nYou will probably have to take it easy on some things to avoid damaging the shunt but other than chances are that you can live a normal life. Can I workout with it? Weight lift? Run? Hit a punching bag? \n\nI have not workout out in like a year and I miss is it every day.\n\nWhen i did try working out in the middle of last year. I had instense head pressure. Like the hulk was squeezing my head. Your doctor is the one to ask - the tech behind your shunt and your own phisiology will determine that.\n\nI have never stopped doing anything in my life - many of those things recklessly, looking back. Just think about stuff that can mess with your shunt; for example i found that heavy deadlifting was a bit tricky not because of the lift, but because of the impact in my body when I went down with the bar. I probably messed something while doing so :) but did not have any symptoms so maybe I was lucky. Things like that can disrupt / dislodge your mechanism.\n\nGetting hit in the head would also be a big no, as you might expect. I climb (indoor bouldering) and because there is no helmet involved, it is always a concern when I have to do harder, less predictable moves, because I can hit my head... But you start knowing your limits and how to stay on your guard. As someone said, ask your doctor these things. FWIW, I was able to start running again about seven months after my shunt was installed.\n\nI knew I was having a problem, but did not know what it was until I had some surgery to remove a neuroma from my ear nerves. I got very unresponsive, clumsy and after I took a spill in the bathroom, she called the neurologist and they said \"Bring him in\".\n\nI do not remember any of this. It was like all of a sudden I was back in my ICU room like no time had passed. At this point they would installed a drain, but a few days later they put the shunt in. And I have been fine since. My 4 year old runs, jumps and falls down all day every day without shunt issues. She is had hers since she weighed only a few pounds. Shunts are actually quite durable! Their entire job is to manage the fluid level (eg pressure) so one should vastly improve your symptoms. Our neurosurgeon, and most I have read about here, will tell you that once you are healed up you should be able to do the same activities as most people. Praying everything goes well for you. Do not be terrified, it will be fine.\n\n I had a shunt put in the day they shut our city down for the pandemic (mine was from a brain tumor that had been removed a couple months earlier, but was still blocking the CSF flow). Got sent home the next day because they did not want me tying up a bed.\n\nThe surgery was no big deal really. The hardware took some getting used to, it is pretty annoying having stuff under your skin, but I do not even think about it now. For about 6 months I could feel the fluid sitting in my abdomen, but I do not anymore. That was actually kind of comforting, because you know it is working. Complications can still arise from the procedure no? That is what worries me. I also know that the liquid goes into your abdomen like you said. And I have major stomach issues too (nobody knows if my cfs and stomach issues are caused by the hydrocephalus). So i wonder how much more my stomach issues will be stressed by the new liquid going into it. \n\nIt is reasuring that the pressure can be changed digitally. In the past you had to constantly change shunts until you found the right one with the right pressure right? Im not quite sure since im new to the chronic illness world (1.5y). How can brain surgery be so easy now? Has medicine really advanced that much in recent years? Yeah, i guess the issue here is figuring out if the shunt will fix my cfs and stomach issues. I had a bunch of health issues pop up all at once last year and my cfs doc is wondering if maybe its the liquid build up causing all this. How long do shunts normally last? I know it last less for the youth cause they grow up and outgrow them. But for an adult they should last a while no? Appreciate the words Complications can arise anytime a surgery is performed.  However, putting in a shunt is so routine by this point that the chance for complications is extremely low.\n\nAlso, the liquid goes into the peritoneal lining which surrounds the organs in the abdominal region of your torso, not directly into the stomach.\n\nTechnically the pressure is changed via a magnet but yes, before that you would needed another surgery to put in a shunt set to the right pressure. That is a million dollar question. Some people go through hundreds and others have them last for decades. Kids 0-2 go through them because the brain is very active and it essentially grows into the pick up catheter, but their height and general growth is typically accounted for by simply adding extra tubing. \n\nThere are multiple types and causes of hydrocephalus so the treatment and success of an individuals shunt has some uniqueness. Unfortunately no one is going to accurately be able to answer your question of how long a shunt will last. How long do you have from a shunt failing until it becomes fatal? Its essentially the same thing as before where the liquid builds up until it becomes a big issue no? I do not know, it is wild. Those guys are on another level though. After the tumor removal I asked my doctor, \u201cso was this like just another Tuesday for you, or was it a big deal?\u201d He said it was pretty notable. The kind of tumor I had you might only encounter once or twice in a career. He watched a surgery on YouTube ahead of time (same one I watched) to see what he was in for. They took some pictures and gave them to me, and it is crazy, there is like a fist sized hole in my brain and they are in there with a vacuum sucking up this tumor. And that is fine apparently, you just put the skull back on and stitch it up, and you are back to normal a couple weeks later. If it had happened to someone 50 or 100 years ago, they would just fall over dead one day, and nobody would have known why, unless someone went in an did an autopsy.\n\nBut the shunt I do not think was a very big deal at all, did not get any pics out of it. Do not think it was more than a 1/4\u201d hole. Well i still have to talk to a neurologist to see if there is a tumor. But my cfs doc that looked over the mri didnt mention anything about it. But im happy everything worked out for you! How did you deal with the knowledge of having that big of a tumor? That your operation/situation was crazy rare?\n\nYoure a tough son a bitch for that \ud83d\ude02 That again depends on the person. Cerebrospinal fluid (csf) kind of moves down a one way street. Hydrocephalus is essentially traffic. Some people have a 6 lane highway going down to a 1 lane road and others are like a 6 lane highway with just one lane closed. My daughter had a very dangerous and quick shunt failure when she was an infant, but when she was bigger had one fail that took days to really manifest. It definitely does not sneak up on you. I have been tricked into thinking my kid had a shunt failure too. A failure is definitely not going to catch you off guard though. People with hydrocephalus do not just drop dead without symptoms. Vomiting, vision issues, inability to rest, head pressure, incontinence, loss of balance etc are generally present in some combination. If they have not said anything yet, you probably do not have a tumor. I knew as soon as I finished the MRI, just reading the face of the tech who unstrapped me. I always joke around a little bit with those people, and when they do not joke back, you know. They sat me in the waiting room and said \u201cwait here and answer that phone if it rings,\u201d when it rang, it was a doctor saying, \u201cwe have got some bad news for you.\u201d So if you have not had that talk, you are probably clear.\n\nI do not think I was that tough about it though. I wanted it. I was carrying so much stress around for years before this, and something like this is a giant reset button. Easily one of the best things that ever happened to me. I feel vastly better a year and a half later, both physically and mentally. Happy to be alive now.\n\nAnyway, you have got this. Only one person on earth is walking the path you are walking. Everything that happens to you is a chapter in a book that nobody else gets to live. Take it and make it a great story. Are u allowed to box after your surgery??

What sort of \u201cupkeep\u201d should I be doing?? Hi, I am 42f. Had a freak occurrence happen to me at age 20 - a ruptured brain aneurysm. The aneurysm was later determined to be something I would had since birth, and it just happened to burst at age 20. It is been determined that I have no other remaining aneurysms. I had a clip placed on the broken vein. Two weeks after that initial craniotomy, I started experiencing severe hydrocephalus. Had a shunt put in.\n\nAnyway, against all odds, I eventually recovered fully. I finished college, &amp; I am married now with three kids. \n\nThe last time I had my shunt \u201cchecked\u201d was 15 years ago before I first started trying to get pregnant. (I wanted to make sure my body was able to handle pregnancy/birth.) At the times, it was more or less implied to me that it was not really necessary to have \u201ccheck-ups\u201d on my shunt, since the hydrocephalus was trauma-induced and was considered to be \u201cresolved\u201d (this was a long time ago, I do not remember if that is the exact word that was used). Since then, I have had no contact with any neurologist. No follow-ups. \n\nMy question: **Do I need to go get my shunt checked out?** How do I know if it is still functioning? Do I need to look into getting it removed if my hydro has truly \u201cresolved\u201d? Or would it be too invasive to have it taken out?\n\nI probably need to get a referral to a neurologist in order to get these questions answered\u2026IDK. Right now I would just really appreciate some input from this group. I feel like sort of an outlier since my hydrocephalus was not something I was born with or have had since childhood; it was caused by acute injuries to the brain. \n\nAnyway, thanks in advance. Hello!  Yes, you should definitely schedule an appointment with your neurologist to ask these questions.  Primary care providers cannot really offer as much insight.  My advice - do not consider having it removed.  It is not hurting anything.  I would make sure it is still active and operational and leave it, in the event you ever need it.\n\nI was born with hydro.  Mine was not the result of something like yours, however...\n\nI was told I had outgrown the condition as a child (I am 48 now) and it turned out I had not.  My shunt malfunctioned 4 years ago but they never looked at it because they assumed I did not need it, so something else must have been causing my issues.  Nope.  By the time they figured it out and replaced my shunt I had lost my vision and am now blind.\n\nBe grateful you are fine and (hopefully) do not need it anymore, but I would act as if you do, and ensure it is functioning, just in case. I think the fact that you are making this thread should answer that for you. Might as well get it checked just for the peace of mind Terrific advice. Thank you so much. I very much appreciate you sharing your story. And I am truly sorry for all you have had to endure. You are right, you are right\u2026I know you are right.

Only symptoms of hydro I had were occasional migraines and visual disturbances. Hydro was spotted by an eye doctor who saw swollen optic nerves. Diagnosis was hydrocephalus caused by Aqueductal stenosis. No tumor or anything like that, apparently just high pressure in my head that developed late. \n\nEnded having an ETV. Felt fine immediately after, but 3 days later felt too dizzy and weak to walk. Was admitted back at the hospital and they found nothing wrong. They said my pressure was okay and I was just showing symptoms of a csf leak as my body adjusts. I was prescribed physical therapy. \n\n3 weeks after that I am walking again just fine\n\nAnd now here is my update as I pass the two month mark. I still would not say im fully recovered.

Doctor said it is compensated or arrested so need of surgery as of now. Only problem she has is occasional headaches or migraine. It took me a couple of months to feel good.  I got these weird dizzy spells lasting a few minutes, and other weird events only lasting a couple of seconds at a time.  Now almost at the two year mark and feeling great, almost back to my previous fitness level (COVID did not help in retraining), and mentally recovered from all of it too.  No headaches other than when I have been sick or really hungover.  Very happy with my ETV experience overall as shunt replacements were getting annoying for me, my body just did not work with them.", "Weather changes What are some of the best ways to deal with weather changes and barometric pressure when you have a shunt?  I would also love to have an answer to this question. I am very sensitive to barometric pressure/weather changes as well. Although I do not have a solution for the symptoms, what I have done is download a weather app on my phone to at least measure the changes. \n\nIf I am having a bad day, I usually take a quick look at the app and see if it can be explained by the pressure. It is not much, but it does kind of put me at ease, in the sense that at least it is probably not a bigger problem.  I can only share my experience and what I think is a  good idea.\n\nI live in Minnesota I have had this shunt the last 15 years I am 22 years old and Have only needed one revision  I have rarely have had a bad headache from weather change.\n\n\nWhat I would suggest you do is download the weather app and start researching the way the weather affects you for example if the temperature drop let us say from 60\u00b0 to 48\u00b0 over the course of a day and you had a headache of 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 write down this information with The circumstances it took place in for example a thunderstorm or a Cold front came in that day start compiling this information over the next couple months and talk to your doctor about it he/she might make an adjustment to your shunt to take more pressure off.\n\n\n Do hot or cold drinks or anything like a heating pad help the headache? I am trying not to take medicine for it and I am just trying to find solutions and ideas that I may have not tried yet. ", "World Hydrocephalus Day! ", "When you have hydrocephalus and cancer...  Sending you hugs \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd7a Sending hugs and health \ud83d\udc99 You got this Prayers and positive thoughts going your way. Aw sending love! This just broke my heart \ud83e\udd7a We are all here for you!! Thanks for the love, guys. This is actually my small child. He was born with hydro and now has cancer as well. Sorry to hear man. Wishing you all the best. I know how you feel. My son was born at 23 weeks with hydro  He was diagnosed with leukemia in January. \n\nHe is now in maintenance and getting much better. I know your child can pull though this. Hugs to your little one too \ud83e\udd17\u2764\ufe0f My kid got hydro because of his cancer. Sending you strength and bravery. \ud83d\udc9b Sending good thoughts and hugs to your son and you\u2764\ufe0f Wow, mine was diagnosed in January too and has B-Cell ALL.  We do not enter maintenance until February though.  He had a shunt malfunction during consolidation, and it took a while for anyone to notice it was the shunt and not the chemo.  I had to demand they do imaging because they would not believe it could be the shunt. Yeah the fear of a shunt failure is real. Our son had a revision about a year ago, and never really fully recovered because, unknown to us, he was starting to suffer from the leukemia.\n\nChemo sucks because nausea is real and now every vomiting episode has an alternate cause.\n\nI am actually glad I witnessed a prior shunt failure so I can better identify if it happens in the next couple years. Kids like this is why I am growing my hair to donate. Hang in there. You got this. Thank you!", "ETV on 6 year old. Hi- so our son who is 6 has congenital hydrocephalus. We found out yesterday that he has aquaductal stenosis and needs an ETV. CAn anyone out there shed some light on this? Especially what the recovery looks like?  I have googled a lot but I would like to hear more from an Actual patient. Thanks for your time. I cannot speak for a 6-year-old, but I had a shunt installed when I was 12 and recently got an ETV at 24.  Maybe it is the fact that I have had 8 surgeries before, but the ETV was not too abnormal and was an easy procedure.  I did notice some dizziness and concentration issues coming out of it, but the pain was not terrible.  I think the pain is worse off with shunts, I remember the one where I was 12, in particular, was really painful, but other surgeries were not as bad.  My pathology is the same, by the way.  Let me know if you have more specific questions. Oh wow. Thank you so much for answering. I feel so lost with all of this. So do you now just have the ETV or both? I am not sure how that works. The neurosurgeon did say that if he cannot make the \u201chole\u201d for the ETV that he would have to do a shunt. But my son is an excellent candidate for the ETV. What does the recovery look like? And I appreciate all of your feedback and advice Just ETV now, as my shunt before had blocked and there was no sense leaving it in. Normally, I think they take it out, I would say because you need to have enough pressure to keep the ETV hole open. \n\nRecovery is going to be different as your son is very much in the paediatric category, where I was an adult when having my ETV. Start him slow, he will feel much better coming out I would say, but would be in discomfort as he is not used to having that much pain. Coming out of hospital will be weird and you will have to keep him patient with recovery, and keep his spirits up. It is a bit traumatizing having a procedure like that as a child, so be sure to support him on that - I cannot give you advice there, but monitor him going through. Recovery may also involve a physical component as the pressure difference can make people a bit dizzy and uncoordinated, but that only takes a few weeks to get back. Normally it is a pretty simple recovery process, but absolutely takes patience. \n\nYou will also need to monitor for complications, which can be nerve-wracking. Make sure you can an eye on things like lethargy, abnormal fatigue, headaches, poor coordination, and other smaller cues like bladder leaks, tremors, and slurred speech. From papers, the calculated risk of ETV revision is best for people with no prior history of shunt blockages and younger individuals, so your son is in luck there. Risk reaches a minimum around 1 year after the procedure. This is really helpful. I sort of figured that the recovery would be tough. It is hard Bc he does not fully tell us how he feels. He just really started too. My heart breaks for all of you.  And I am assuming that he thinks all of this pain is normal. So the surgery is that painful?  I am sorry for all your pain too. This is really helpful to hear the truth. I might keep coming back to you with more questions. How does the weather and pressure affect you? The first shunt is bad because they have to make a way for the catheter that goes from the brain, outside the skull, and down into the stomach, so that is pretty invasive. That said the pain resided largely after three days, and was resolved after a week. No idea on first-time ETVs, mine was not that bad in terms of pain. I think I had a couple Tylenol in the first couple days after but nothing more, and probably did not need it. And yes, he probably thinks those headaches and that pain is status quo, I certainly did before my first treatment. And fire away on questions, I am available. My daughter had an ETV at 4 months and another one at 3 yrs old. She is doing great. She was lethargic a few days after the surgeries but bounced back very well Thank you this means so much. I really appreciate it. I will ask questions as I think of them. Thank you for making yourself available. I just want to cry. Wow I did not realize that ETVs might need to be done more than once. Why does that happen?? No problem! Message me whenever you have questions. Hi again...so his ETV will also have a reservoir. Do you have that?  Doc said it is to help measure the pressure in the future. The ETV just clears the ventricle right? And I am reading that sometimes the ETV has to be re-done? I do not have a reservoir and have not heard of it.  Sounds like an additive thing, for which I am under MCP so the healthcare system does not tend to do many extras.  I could be wrong on that though.\n\nYes, the ventricles can seal up again over time, or the hole at the bottom of the ventricle can block.  It tends to happen within the first year of surgery, but can happen after. Oh wow. So first year is really touch and go. Crazy how you have no control over any of this. I did not realize that the ventricle could really close up again. Today I tried to explain to him that in a few weeks his head will not hurt anymore. But from what your telling me post surgery is tough too. Not that it matters at all... but I am assuming that after surgery your head is wrapped and the scar is pretty big? I am just trying to get an idea as to what to tell him. He is so young. Nope the scars (normally two, one in back and one in front) are pretty small and normally obscured by your hair.  For me, my hairline is just outside one of them, but the incision was immaculate so you do not see anything, though there is a tiny divot there from where they made the burr hole into the skull.  Very minor issue there.  The entire head is normally not wrapped, you have a bandage just over each of the incisions.  And I would not say it is touch and go first year, but it is something to be cognizant of. Ok, for lack of better words... it is not as bad as I thought. I am happy to hear that your scars are ok (I know big picture not a big deal- we all have scars) I just like to have some idea. Ok I will stay cognizant and try not to be neurotic. Thanks again. I am so glad I connected with you. It is so odd that with all the information out there, I have not found any resources that has detailed info like what you are sharing. So I really appreciate it! Great to hear I can be of help. Again, touch base anytime you have questions. An ETV and a shunt have basically the same failure rate. It is not low, unfortunately. ETVs will grow closed, they also might just not drain enough. Basically just not working correctly.\n\nYour son's condition is a prime candidate for the procedure. My son has had a shunt,shunt,shunt and a failed ETV, shunt and shunt.  \n\nPersonally I am not a fan of the ETV. If you look on FB there are a lot of posts about people who have memory issues etc  however, that sample pool is not the best.\n\nShunts carry more risks of infection as it is a foreign body. The ETV is a more risky of the two. \n\nBest of luck! Thank you for the info. I appreciate it. Keep us updated. No prob! As a parent, I understand what you are going through. No matter which option you take, both come with positives and negatives. Enjoy and appreciate each day. Kids are stronger than you can imagine. My 5 year old son just had this done in May. It was hard the first few days for him. Idk if every case is the same but we had to be cleared by PT and multiple doctors before we could leave. It took him about 5 days to walk steady again. Lots of patience and love will be needed. You got this! Thank you i appreciate your feedback How did it go? Hi- so it is actually this Tuesday. Nerve wracking. Fingers crossed and like a shunt it has equal chance of failing. Be prepared. Hope for the best but always be alert. Thank you for the reality check. \ud83d\ude05 sorry if I came across a bit cold. But unfortunately that is the reality of ETVs and shunts. Sometimes the medical experts will be wrong. It is your duty to question them and never leaving unless you are satisfied with the results. Oh I totally agree. You were not cold. You are a realist. and I appreciate that!  We will see he is litterally in their now How did it go? Awe hey! So surgery went well but recovery so far has sucked. The incision and reservoir area is smaller than I thought it was going to be. Tomorrow another mri. Fingers crossed. Thanks for checking in. Glad to hear! Hey! How is the recovery process going? Hi! So the ETV and reservoir went ok, as well as his cat scan and mri post op while still in hospital. However unfortunately we just went for his one week follow up and Bc he is symptomatic (nausea, vomiting, head pain, eye pain) the neurosurgeon is doing 1 week of Advil every 6 hours to reduce inflammation, and on 12/4 another sedated mri with flow study. He said it could be just taking him longer to heal... or it could be that the ETV stopped working. Then we would need to do a shunt. Sigh. So kind of you for checking in. I am sorry to hear that! Papilledema is a sure sign. Hope your issues are resolved ASAP. An ETV is a scary thing, I had the procedure done a little under a year ago and fully recovered about a month after it was done. The recovery is a little odd, it is not like a shunt recovery, it gives you this feeling of a legitimate hole in your head and will lead you to feeling achy. The recovery can be a sensitive thing just like the procedure itself, the best thing to do is to let your son rest (he will really want to). I would suggest letting him rest in a dark and quiet room as it will help minimize part of the pain, I know it sounds odd but due to the ETV essentially allowing for the fluid to \u201cact\u201d correctly it can fluctuate whenever there is any stimulus or change in blood flow/pressure. I will be praying for you and your son as well as the recovery. Hey! Just checking in. How is your little guy doing? Thank you so much for your feedback. He was doing ok. But we have to go for another mri. He is still having symptoms. This will be a long road. Thank you so much for checking in. Well when it rains it pours. So he was due to go for another mri... but My husband and I got covid. We are doing fine now. My son was fine too. We changed the mri to this Friday ... but when he went for a covid test it came back positive. So idk know. I called the neurosurgeon to see if they will still do it Bc he is still having pain and vomiting.  So I do not know what will happen. They said they will call me tomorrow. This will be a long road. I am sorry to hear that! It seems a shunt is absolutely needed. I highly doubt they will do surgery now though. Hope you guys recover ASAP. Sorry for late responding. The healing of the area may eventually close the hole back up Thank you.", "Dealing with hydrocephalus I pretty much had hydrocephalus since an infant. When I was 11 I had a malfunction and it took a about 2 months being in the hospital for them to find that out. as always the shunt is the first thing they check but they did not find anything with the regular cat scan. They had to take 3D imaging to actually see the malfunction. After that I felt much better a few headaches a month but nothing that was as bad as the ones from the malfunction.\n\nA few years after (14/15years old) it got bad again. It is very vague but I remember it was early in the year around December to January. It was very bad for a month straight from when I woke up to the time I went to sleep. The fact that laying down made it worse it was nothing I could do. These were very close to the headaches of the malfunction but not that bad. My mom ended up taking me to the emergency room which they examined me. We did all the things to make sure the shunt was working properly and it was. We stayed a few days and in that time they gave me something that did get rid of the headaches but it may very jittery like my arms would jump or my legs would kick.\n\nThey came to a conclusion I might have cluster headaches so I went home with some medication but it did not work i was back in the emergency room and again nothing. My mom decided to schedule an appointment but at this time my pediatrician was out of town.\n\nWe came around to maybe it is my diet so we completely changed it he said caffeine was good though. At this point my head is still hurting nothing is changing all I wanted was to be able to go a day without these headaches. I do not remember too much but at the time I did not understand this. He was trying to insinuate I was making the headaches up( at this point it is hard to focus but my mom was mad in the car) he prescribed something else which did not work either. I forgot exactly what it was but when I looked it up it was for people who were in the military something along the lines of ptsd not exactly but basically more of a mind drug. We go back and he is talking about i should try to wait 2 to 3 months for it to work. Please put yourself in my shoes. Would you wait that long or go find another opinion. In this moment I am going on 2 months with these head aches with small breaks. I honestly stopped taking the medication but thankfully the headaches went away before spring break( I remember because my birthday was coming up).\n\nThis happened again the next year but before summer started. I had a good few hour gaps without headaches each week but this was still as bad. After a month we went to the emergency room and reminder at this point the headaches are draining me. Long story short they tried to say i was depressed but the nurse asked me some questions more specifically about my dad leaving and I felt kind of pushed to say it but she wanted to know if I missed him I answered yes but I really have not thought of him that much anyways but it was not until we left my mom told me that they suspect depression. Now if I did look depressed which I probably was it was because of the torture of not knowing when these headaches would end. Each night I prayed for these headaches to go away. But it made me upset they did not take into consideration that I look down because of my headaches. At this point I felt completely alone. The headaches did eventually go away and I am 18 now. I have not been through that constant pain for sometime now. It makes me appreciate the little more. I had 1 bad headache this year at school that lasted a few hours which I cried it was so bad. I was happy once it went away ever since that they have been more frequent but not bad at all maybe 2 6s a month at the most. \n\nDoes anybody else deal with these headaches that last a long period of time I usually use mint oil but with bad ones it does not work that good. What are some things or over the counter medicine that could help. Tylenol does not work at all to help. \n\n I do not want to make this too long so I will stop now but I would appreciate anybody\u2019s feedback. I have just come to the realization I have to live with it but my family tries to help a lot. I am used to doing things with a headache but they just say sit down or take it slow. It is hard to explain to them especially since I know their only trying to help. I am almost 40 now, but have dealt with 'chronic daily head pain' since around the time puberty hit.  It is been an ongoing battle that has exhausted me and I have gone through probably close to a hundred different meds trying to find a solution but I have hit the point where I am not willing to continue throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks any more. I have been using medical marijuana for a few years now, but even that is to mostly take my mind away from the pain that I still feel.   i wish you good luck in finding a solution. There is no medical cure for hydro. The medication they are prescribing will never help , it will just mask the underlying issue. Nearly all shunts have drainage issues which will lead to headaches that could be a lifelong battle. Slits vents is treatable but you would need a neurosurgeon that would acknowledge the issues. Cat scans and MRIs do not always pick up the issues.", "Could I have hyrdrocephalus? I got an MRI done due to pressure sensations around my skull. Not painful but just an odd sensation. It showed a probable arachnoid cyst in the left middle cranial fossa and a cavum septum pellucidum et vergae.  The pressure sensations are primarily near where the arachnoid cyst is located. I was not diagnosed with anything. My ventricles look larger than other MRI images I see. Tried a GP but he suggested my skull pressure needed a neck massage...

Every single time. My last scans in mid may showed nothing to worry about so I am just like: is this the unfortunate new normal for me? Has anyone had similar issues? I am just trying to make sense of it. my mom has had similar complaints recently. we sent her to the emergency room and they said it was \u201cjust a bad migraine\u201d and gave her some daily medicine to take. however her balance is now suffering because of it and she has physical therapy. i suggest seeing your doctor and discussing it! I had MRIs following a mini stroke and they could not find anything wrong on the scans (I was at a different hospital from where I had all my brain surgery so the hospital did not have my notes). They discharged me, I felt completely fine, but then a few weeks later it happened again. This time I went to my regular hospital and again, the scans did not show anything but my surgeon was convinced that my symptoms indicated a blockage. They operated and he was right, it had become blocked all the way and the whole shunt needed to be replaced. \n\nLong story short, scans do not always show up everything, even when they are trying to see something specific. YOU are the first port of call to alert to a problem, not a scan. If you are having daily migraines in that spot you definitely should visit the hospital and explain your history. To build on this. That is exactly what our NICU doctors, nurses, and Respiratory therapists said. If you notice anything abnormal say something. Sometimes symptoms do not present themselves in obvious ways in test, scans, or even behavior.

They could not tell me what was causing the fluid buildup and i wont meet with the children's neurosurgeon until next week. Has anyone ever seen a positive outcome with a baby like this? Or have any insights? I realize he may need a shunt but at this point I do not know if he will even survive or be severely disabled or have manageable disabilities. Feeling really, really hopeless. They told my parents when I had a stroke at 3 weeks they did not know if I would walk or talk or be functioning, but now I am going off to college in another state pretty soon. Just try to do all you can do to help your baby. You can definitely try physical/occupational therapy if there are any problems (even if there are not, it is not like it can hurt). There is a wide variety of how people with hydro turn out. Some of it is dependent on how fast they get treatment and what type of support they get afterwards. Maybe a parent would have better advice than me, but this subreddit is not as active as the Facebook pages so if you are looking for more people in your situation I would try joining one of those groups.  Also, there are peer support groups through the hydrocephalus association and I think they can try to set you up with someone in a similar situation to you so you can ask for advice directly. They do both calls and emails.  Do not feel hopeless. I did when my son was diagnosed with hydrocephalus at 19weeks. 3 1/2 years old now and doing great. Shunt surgery at 9days old. We were told nothing but negative outcomes but here we are today with a healthy boy. I wish you and the baby the best. You will be ok.  There is indeed hope!

Brain bleed after just a few days, saw it on an ultrasound. \n\nWas devastated due to not knowing anything and we heard so many sad stories of children getting all kinds of disabilities due to hydrocephalus.\n\nFast forward 2 years and here we are today, she has a VP shunt. She has had 6 brain surgeries in total. First one at just ~700 gram in GW 27 or so. There have been ups and downs but all in all, she is the most healthy 2 year old there is. Climbing as a monkey - actually much more than her peers in the same age. Her mobility has not been affected at all. 0 neurological disabilities on top of that. She is alive and doing really well, albeit having had 2 infections in total. Those were scary as hell.\n\nHopefully you have a SO to battle this through together. Nobody should go through it alone. All the best, best of luck to all of you and your family!  Different prognosis. My daughter was born at 26 weeks with a grade three intraventrucular hemorrhage. It is felt like a terrifying lonesome battle at times, but she is nearly 2 and doing what regular little kids do. It is real scary, there is no way around it. Try not to play doctor Internet.

I had absolutely NO issues at all, even though the OB/GYN I had was OTT ridiculous about Ultrasounds, etc. I finally had to get my Neurosurgeon who was the Prof &amp; Chair of the Dept of Neurosurgery at a large hospital in Michigan.\n\nI did really well with the pregnancy, I worked right up until he was born, etc. I was not sick, and I basically went about my life as I did with my prior pregnancies.

Or just a regular diver. Hell, my doctor would not let me ride roller coasters  Honestly did not even think about the G-force of takeoff, most definitely more of an impact This, I have gone snorkeling and could get to depths that were excruciating for my head with just holding my breath and swimming down with flippers. Hmm. If our shunts are supposed to make things \"normal,\" why do we still have these problems? To people with ETVs and no shunts not have these problems? When I had a working shunt, airplane rides were excruciating. The one airplane ride I had after my ETV was no more annoying than getting on a subway train. Hi, can you expand on the flights being excruciating for you? I have had a shunt my whole life and have flown before, but had a major revision in 2016 and have not flown since. I do have 2 flights scheduled for later this year, and I have been kind of nervous for the first flights since the surgery. What exactly was your experience? It was mostly fine until you start the descent. It is going to suck, I have noticed it is better in a smaller plane. It is just this wild pain, in your head and your ears, and the only thing that helps it is putting pressure around your head, like holding it or having someone hold it. I do not know if it is a hydrocephalus thing, or like a me thing. I am pretty sure it is not the same deal as what gum fixes though. ...shit. Does it get better like in the next few mins after landing? Yeah, but then I am like deaf for 12 hours. And again, this is my body. Yours might be different. Thank you for the insight! Glad to see you are doing better with the ETV. Cheers I got to experience diving and I was hooked. That is until I talked with my doctor. He said I could not do it not because of my shunt but because of my epilepsy. If I were to have a seizure underwater, I would drown. He did give the go ahead to skydive. I have done it twice and I cannot wait to get back up in the air. I am not doing it by myself. I am attached to an instructor (tandem) but it is totally worth every dollar. I do not have any problems with altitude and no issues with the pressure at that altitude (15,000 ft). My ears pop as we are going up and free falling but other than that no issues. I urge everyone that wants to and has clearance from their dr to experience it. I have not had any problems flying anywhere and I fly at least a couple times a year. It took me a couple days to really adjust to the pressure change in Santa Fe vs living at sea level though.  That is great! I am hoping my symptoms will be minimal but the weather really bothers me on a day to day basis so it is hard for me to be optimistic. Only way to find out is to just go for it I guess.  This topic is great.  Thanks for posting.", "Question about a symptom.  When I have issues with high pressure my hearing very suddenly \"switches off\" for periods of about 5-30 minutes and normally only one ear at the time. When this happened to me the first time, I went to my GP because I am great at being in denial about my shunt being blocked. They did some tests and determined that there were no inner ear issues and it was \"nerve deafness\". I am assuming this is an ear version of the tunnel vision from pressure on the optic nerves. It normally happens for a little while after my shunt is replaced and then everything is fine until my shunt blocks again. I have had my shunt for 25 years and over 100 revisions. This has happened for the last 4 or so years for the last 15 or so revisions.", "Update and question So after my last emergency surgery on Monday I feel better.im able to stay awake for long hours and do some normal things. I am struggling with the (3) incisions and slight headache, dizziness, and sometimes my hands feel tingling. Is this normal? What should I do about the headache and incision pain? Not much you can do other than take advantage of the pain meds you were prescribed. The incision pain should only be bad for a few days if that helps. When the nerves start regenerating about 3 days after surgery, it is quite painful, but it does not last too long. If you are not coping with the pain, speak to a doctor about getting some different pain medication.  I had a full shunt replacement a month ago (head neck and stomach incisions) and I stayed in the hospital for less than 24 hours came home and stayed in bed for a week with people bringing me food.  It has been nearly a month now but I too get some dizziness when going from sitting to standing.  I had incision pain for a few weeks even with meds.  The slight Headache is there for me too but nothing debilitating.  The odd thing is that for some time after surgery I got no headaches at all but slowly got a slight headache but it is slowly subsiding.  Hope this helps although I do not know if this is normal. I hear ya on the dizziness. I did not have a problem with dizziness after I was shunted, but the dizziness got crazy bad after I had an ETV last Summer. \n\nIf it gets bad for you, you might want to consider looking into vestibular physical therapy. I have been getting PT since this past July. They say I am not 100% of the way back to what I was, but I am getting there. \n\nI was also given a script for Meclizine, but I am not terribly fond of it. It makes me crazy tired. \n\nGood luck to you!  I was only given tremadol \n Get lots of rest/sleep and make sure you are hydrated.  Not much else I am aware of to help. It will eventually get better. I have had all those things after surgery before. ", "4 weeks post op: Hydrocephalus shunt (Strata:2) \nWondering if anybody else on this forum has had a similar procedure done &amp; what the overall recovery is like. I am still feeling tired / less in control of my senses. I experienced this with my previous CM1 Decomposition. After 6-8 months of healing I was able to swim / dive &amp; enjoy normal activities. Ive already experienced the recovery after a brain surgery. I am just wondering what can I do to speed up recovery time / get my energy back faster. There is not really much you can do to speed up recovery - you just have to listen to your body and do what it is telling you. I think trying to rush the process would have negative effects on your body. I was like you in terms of wanting to get back to my normal activities really quickly but I think in the long run it actually made my recovery a little longer. Get as much rest as you can, take your vitamins and take your time!  Best of luck :) I agree, take your time. I thought I was ready and back to me way sooner than I actually was and it was not until the fog fully lifted 6 - 7 months later that I realised I obviously was not quite back to normal. \nBe patient and good luck", "Getting medical records Why is getting medical records so annoying? I got my shunt placed in 2007 when I was 17 in Atlanta and they are not very responsive. I recently tried to get a MRI of my hand and they could not do it because they did not know what kind of shunt I have because they did not have my records. The radiologist told me when I got my surgery, I was supposed to get a card or something that says what kind of shunt I have in case of emergencies. I never got that, and no one will call me back to get that info to me. I am so tired of calling them \ud83d\ude2b thanks for letting me rant. I have the Medtronic cards and use one hospital system for everything. Some doctors still want X-ray confirmation of the pacemaker/shunts I have. With shunts, I still have to see my neurosurgeon after MRIs to check settings. They have always changed from the MRI. If your shunt valve is programmable, you will want it checked after your scan. It is a pain in the ass\u2026 could you maybe get a CT of your hand instead? \n\nIf that is not an option, and you cannot get the info from your surgeon, you could get a shunt series to see what kind of valve you have (3 X-rays) but again, if your valve is programmable, it will likely change settings from the MRI, so you will need it checked and adjusted afterwards. I am sorry you have run into this issue. This is extremely helpful. Thank you so much! CurdledTexan is right, an xray should help to identify the shunt you have. This site is in german but as you can see its quite common practice to do so if no information about the shunt is available:\n\n(\n\n(And in the unlikely case your doctors cannot identify the shunt you have on an x-ray the doctors from the clinic above even offer to try to help if you send them the x-ray)", "How long have you had your shunt?

One calcified broken one, and another (may be calcified) supposedly connected one. I am not sure if the tube I am feeling is the broken or connected one as I cannot feel the other, but I woke up this morning with my head feeling heavy. Feels like increased pressure. Planning on going to the ER, but wanted to see if others ever felt this way. Not sure if it is the humidity since I live in GA. Constant pressure headaches. It was very gradual until I realized I was having headaches all the time again. After a shunt study confirmed the malfunction, I got another revision and feel much better. Oooh, how long before you went in did you have them? I might have to wait till Monday, but I am worried a bit. Constant pressure headache, cannot keep anything down (neither solids nor liquids), off balance, fatigued all the time Get it checked out; do not wait ! The head pressure lead to a lumbar puncture. My CSF pressure was 33CCs , almost went blind Headaches, pulling in my stomach, nausea, pain along my shunt tubing and just not feeling like myself. As the symptoms became more severe, I felt like my brain was being electrocuted/zaps and burning sensations. FYI: my shunt tubing was broken in multiple places. My shunt was working. Ooooh, how long was it broken, and did they say you had to get it fixed immediately ? They are not sure how long it was broken, but according to my prior imaging, it was less than 6 months. I had to get a CT scan to make sure the fluid was not building up. The tubing made a hole through my tissue because it was in there for 23 years. That is how the fluid continued draining. I had to get to an ophthalmologist immediately to make sure I did not have pressure building up in my optic nerve. Because these two things were clear, I did not need emergency surgery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, less than a week later, my tubing broke again up by my ear and that caused a ton of issues.

The pressure goes away after I stand back up or stop doing that exercise Hi, I had this problem before I was diagnosed, but after my surgery I no longer have it Had exact same when IIH was at its worst.   Spinal tap drain insta fixed it.   Now I use Diamox when it gets bad Thanks for the response!

I only got my shunt in under a month ago and maybe less than 3 weeks ago i got the level changed from 4 to 6 cos of overdrainage.

But they might also want to send a sample of CSF to the lab to check for infection. It is better to be safe than sorry. I wish you the best. it is like a bump on the inside of my head do you know what it could be ? Not for sure but there could be a CSF leak from a blockage. When do you go back for a check up?

Hello! I have my septum and nips done. I have had multiple scans/procedures (not hydro related, but I was fully sedated) with the jewelry in, and here is how.\n\n1) always. ALWAYS. tell your doctor's about your piercings. Do not hide them.\n\n2) the reason you are not generally not allowed jewelry in OR is because when they make an incision the scalpel has a small electrical charge to cauterise the opening so you do not bleed too much. Science! Because of the electrical charge there is a chance that it could arc across your skin to and metal and cause severe burns.\n\n3) in scans (particularly in MRI) there can be a danger of your metal piercings either exiting your body suddenly.. which is bad.. or heating up... Which is also bad.\n\nNow here is how to get around all of that.\n\nBorosilicate glass. Go online (message me for actual shop reccomendations) and find glass spacers for your piercings. They 1) only barely show up on scans 2) will not mess with you or the machines 3) will not conduct electricity 4) because they are clear for the most part I have literally had doctors forget they were even there. BUT I DID STILL TELL THEM. Always. Tell. Your. Doctor. \n\nHope this helps. Titanium does not need to be removed. It is non magnetic. Right, but most MRI Technicians will not take your word that the metal is 100% titanium.    The Mri will cause trouble if there are any magnetic metals in the jewelry The long and short of it is yes, you will have to take them out. I have had 6 surgeries and a countless number of scans/X-rays. Each time, I was asked to remove any jewellery. I did not ever ask why so I am sorry I cannot give you the reason why but there you go.", "Baby bike helmet? Our child (almost 9mo old) has a VP shunt on the rear right of his head. He is doing great, and we are excited to get him into the baby seat on the back of the bike in the next few months. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions on best type of helmets for kids with shunts? What type does the best to protect the shunt from impact (or do any)? Obviously it is a concern if all the pressure from a helmet is pushing on the shunt in the event of a crash.\n\nThanks in advance! 27 year old here, had vp shunt since 2 year old and still havent found suitable helmet, best to my knowledge there is no specific helmet for kids, in fact had nasty fall at age of 10 and other than concussion and 10 days in hospital spent just in case i had no other issues I have had my shunt since 3mo and have just had to fight it out with normal helmets. If you decide to go that route and they show discomfort, you can kind of push towards the opposite side (do not tilt) and that might relieve some of the pressure for a while. Our daughter is 17 mo and we got her first bike helmet about 6 months ago. We did a lot of searching for something we could fit to her head, but also did not want to sacrifice safety. We ended up going with a bell toddler helmet that has removable foam pads for fitting, and figured we could cut those up if we needed to make a little nook for her shunt (hers is at the front right side of her head a bit behind her hairline).\n\nShe hated the helmet in general, but we would put it on a bit loosely while doing non-biking activities (like riding in her push car) to get her used to it, and without any modifications it seemed to fit fine. \n\nKeep in mind your kiddo's head size compared to age when you are looking at sizing...I think we needed the 2-4 year old size even though she was not quite a year old just because her head circumference was still so much larger than average. Thanks appreciate this :) Thank you! Awesome, going to look for one with a bit more of the foam padding. Thanks! I had a shunt from when I was 13 months but I had quite a low profile shunt I think. The newer programmable ones seem to have massive bits that stick up on the skull. I had/have a small silicone bubble which has been variably on the top right of my head or the back corners. I found my scars to be more painful with helmets but I have had more surgeries than most. I always had a normal although top of the range helmet. I do have a memory of being an adult L/XL helmet from the age of like 8 though so definitely expect to be up a few sizes.", "Bone conductor Bluetooth headphones Hi, has anyone used or know if bone conductor headphones are safe with hydro and shunts etc. Also have a brain tumour. I will be asking my consultant when I speak to him in a few weeks anyway but thought I would ask here too.

If so, sames! I have used regular Bluetooth headphones. I have not had any issues. I would assume bone conduction headphones are fine. But I would check with your doctor or someone to be sure. What are bone conductor headphones? They personally caused me a myriad of symptoms but I also have 3 shunts which is more than most people have. I personally use regular bluetooth headphones/earbuds and my programmable shunt has not changed it is setting ever since I got it They use Bone conduction instead of magnets I will google that Along the same lines, has anyone used a VR headset (like oculus rift) and had problems after? I was not comfortable using my brothers VR headset but I think that was largely due to location of my shunt / headset straps and other recentish washout surgery which meant I still had slightly sensitive head Thanks for your input everyone. I will update you after I have spoken to my consultant in a few weeks. My shunt is not programmable which probably helps but I do have a couple of holes etc hence the concern over the bone element I have a fixed pressure shunt and have used bone conduction headphones since January of last year.

Looking for answers because my neurosurgeon doesnt have any...please help. Ill try to make this as short as i can.  Im 25 years old and female.  8 months ago i started having a buildup of symptoms out of nowhere that included:\n\n-a constant headache that got worse and worse\n\n-increased sense of smell\n\n-pain behind one eye and little blurry sometimes\n\n-a lot of pressure in my head\n\nand a few other minor symptoms.  The headache and the pressure were the main part. I saw a neurologist/neurosurgeon and the CT/MRI showed my ventricles were huge.  In september I had a shunt put in for hydrocephalus.  After a lot of tests, he said he couldnt find a cause for my hydrocephalus.\n\nMy headaches had gotten a lot better and almost no pain at all in the 3 months after surgery...until about 2 weeks ago.  I felt pressure building backup and my headaches and other symptoms were back.  Ive been in really bad pain the last few days to the point of crying.\n\n\n\nI went and saw my neurosurgeon the other day.  He did a CT scan and said my ventricles look fine.   He said he didnt have an answer  so he is sending me to a neurologist because he said it might be migraines. \n\n\nThis was really frustrating because it feels like the exact same symtpoms as before i got the shunt even though my ventricles look fine.  It seemed like the shunt was working great for a few months too but now apprently i have migraines???    Could it be possible that the shunt isnt working right even though my CT scans look okay?  Im very confused about why i feel the same symptoms as before but why my ventricles look okay.\n\n\nIf anyone has any advice i would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.\n A friend of mines father had a shunt put in a few years ago. It was great for a while but his symptoms came back fairly soon . Turns out the shunt was the wrong size and was eventually changed to one a proper size for him and he has not had any major problems at all since then  Thank you for your reply.  Do you know in what way was in the wrong size?  Like it was draining too much/too little?  Mine is adjustable.  Or the whole thing was just too big for his head?\n\nAlso, do you know how they figured out it was too big?\n\nThanks! It was too big and was draining to much. Sorry I have no idea how the doctors figured it out. The next time I am down with him I will ask but I am sure someone will be on here soon with more of an understanding than me. Hope you sort it out soon and feel better  Thank you. I am also female and 25 so weird coincidence haha. There are times when the pain from my body readjusting to normal pressure have hurt as much if not more than the high pressure this has often lasted for a couple of months for me. Does the pain get worse when you stand up or sit down? That is pretty characteristic of that issue for me.\n\nHave you have any cold or flu symptoms recently? Colds suck with shunts. Your CSF has a lot of proteins and things in it when you have a cold and that makes it thicker and decreases the flow rate. Much pain. Because of this, I never bother going to hospital if I have any flu symptoms as I know they will not do anything.\n\nShunts can block very quickly after being put in and your ventricles might not expand and show it on the scans. Ask for an ophthalmology review. They will look for papillodema (sp?) or swelling of the optic nerves/discs which indicates increased intercrainal pressure. They may also do a field test to test your peripheral vision which can sometimes decrease with pressure. I have this done every time as my ventricles do not expand (separate condition).\n\nAbove all, push your doctors and surgeons to do something. I have had some major complications when they have waited too long to act. They have for the most part resolved themselves but spending time walking with aids at our age when you were previously fine sucks. They seem to see the risks of doing something more than the current pain for people our age. A question I often ask them is \"well what else could it be?\" followed by \"what are we going to do about that then?\". They almost never have an answer to the first question and then we do surgery.\n\nSeparate to this, this is your first shunt, it may never be a problem again, it may be a problem every few months. I have had about 75 shunt replacements since I got my shunt when I was 1. It did not become a hindrance to my life until the last year. This is hard at our age when our careers are starting. Talk to someone. A councillor, someone in HR, student councillor at uni, whoever. Get advice on how to handle an issue, before it becomes an issue.\n\nGood luck! My pain is constant whether im standing or sitting.\n\n\n\nWhat you said about colds/flus is interesting.  I did have a cold about a month ago.  Ill ask my neurologist about that tomorrow.\n\n\nThank you so much for your very thoughtful and kind reply.  It was very helpful.  I will be sure to push my neurosurgeon more on what to do about this.  Good luck to you too! When I had my last one replaced about 25 years ago, they told me I could get *low* pressure headaches. Could this be what is happening for you? Do you have any other symptoms? Do you just need glasses :) I am female and 25 too, just had a shunt put in in November. I had a really nasty flu that let up last week and I feel like my head is going to explode. I called my neurosurgeon today because I did not know what is going on and the last thing I want is another shunt adjustment (the last two have been hell). They asked if I was still congested (I said yes but barely) and they told me that that could be the cause. Have you been sick recently?  &gt;I am female and 25 too, just had a shunt put in in November.\n\nWow, lots of 25 year old females in here that have shunts haha.  Was yours congenital?  If it wasnt, did they ever figure out what the cause was?  The doctors said mine is idiopathic (we dont know the cause).\n\n&gt;Have you been sick recently? \n\nSomeone else asked the same thing.  I remembered that I had a cold around the time that my headaches started to flare up.  It wasnt a bad cold and didnt last too long.  Going to talk to my neurosurgeon about it next week.\n\nThanks!\n\n I wish these headaches could just be fixed with glasses haha!\n\n\nThe doctor said my ventricles look fine so he thought the pressure was fine and didnt want to mess with the setting on my adjustable shunt.  I will be sure to ask him about low pressure at my next appointment. Haha I noticed that too!  And mine is idiopathic as well. I originally had a large cyst that was filling up with fluid and when that was drained the fluid then just began building up outside of it. They are not sure what caused the cyst, if I would have the fluid anyways, or if the surgery/remains of the cyst blocked a ventricle  Any follow-up for this? I got my 2nd shunt installed in May 2016, but have never experienced 100% relief. It has improved, but I am going through the same issue as you are, where I am still symptomatic even though all scans look \"fine\". Just wondering if this got resolved for you.  hello, sorry for such a late reply.  I dont use this account very much.\n\nthat is funny, it soubds like we have the same problem.  I got a second opinion from a different neurosurgeon about a month ago and he said i was draining too much CSF.  \n\nUnfortunately is hasnt seemed to help my pain and i think its actually made it worse.  I just had my second adjustment to drain even less fluid about 2 weeks ago.  My neurosurgeon said to wait it out for about a month because it will take my brain time to adjust.  Im currently in the ER receiving IV meds because my headache is so bad :-/.  Hopefully something gets better soon.\n\n\nHow about you?  Any luck? Hi, sorry to hear about your last few months. I hope you can find some relief soon. Nothing I have taken has helped pain in any way. All I can really do that helps is sleep. \n\nIn my case, after the adjustment I mentioned in my comment, it was discovered that we let too much fluid back in, and we readjusted to let more fluid out. I have been seeing the doc every 2 weeks to monitor results. I have an appt tomorrow, because I had a really terrible weekend and I think I might need yet another adjustment, making it 3 in 2 months. Like you said, it really is best to wait it out to stabilize, but I think this most recent \"dip\" has been bad enough that it warrants another look. ", "Questions- 26/F.

TLDR questions in bold, and more at bottom in a numbered list. \n\nJust to be thorough here is some bg information, as I was not told the specific type of hydro I have: \n\n* In May 2020 I had a pineal gland removal for an obstructive cyst/tumor. My neurosurgeon\u2019s nurse said she is unsure if I had hydrocephalus before bc of the cyst/tumor itself or if the surgery caused it. What my neuro team is contributing to hydro are symptoms I had before my surgery as well. Was told its often hard for pineal cyst/tumor patients to sense a difference in symptoms of the cyst/tumor and hydro as they are very very similar. \n* Sometime in September my team had me get a lumbar puncture to test for hydro due to continuing headache and neuro symptoms. Opening pressure 22. I was put on Diamox sequels for 2 months with little relief and apparently dangerous side effects I only found out at the 2 month mark.\n* November I had my 6 month post op pinealectomy appointment and was told I most likely have hydrocephalus, but wanted to have my intracranial pressures rechecked and was given it as an option for more peace of mind in case anything changed. I did not want another brain surgery and needed that peace of mind.\n* Dec 16 had the second LP with the same opening pressure of 22, confirmed hydrocephalus. My nurse mentioned slit ventricles and I had no idea what that meant and was in too much pain to ask.\n\nRecovering that same day in the office, I did not get a lot of time with my neurosurgeon at all nor with my nurse. She told me more about what hydrocephalus would mean in my November follow up than Dec 16, so I asked for a brochure or something on hydro but was given my surgeon's basic pre-op guide packet that I got before my pinealectomy. I am left with a lot of questions. **Should I wait until my pre op appointment to ask my nurse?** Things like, what side will the shunt be on, etc.\n\nAlso, I was told my recovery would be easier than my previous brain surgery as a shunt surgery is less invasive. I would spend one night in the ICU post op, then would go back to my hotel room (neurosurgeon is based 4 hours away). My plan is to spend a week recovering, then go home for a week and come back for the 2 week post-op appointment and suture removal.   \ntw for brain surgery recovery, emetophobia. Necessary bg info for questions.\n\n&gt;!I had a rough recovery for my pinealectomy in May and am literally terrified of surgery now, especially brain surgery. I had extreme headaches and vomited every single day for 2 weeks until being given scopolamine patches. At around 3-4 weeks post op I called for refills of my pain and antiemetic medications, but was denied any pain prescriptions due to my surgeon's office policy. I was not told anything about it pre-op, only when I called. Office policy is no pain med prescriptions past the 2 week post-op mark. Was told to use OTC meds but they made absolutely no difference. I continued to have extreme, 7-10 level headaches until about July.\nIn June I went to ER for headaches and continuing nausea, only after that did I find out in May I walked out of the 2 day Neuro ICU recovery with a really bad UTI, which may have contributed to my symptoms immediately post-op but idk. Surgeon said my recovery was typical but the whole time something felt direly wrong.\nImmediately post-op for the about 2 weeks I spent vomiting every day I also dealt with such severe light sensitivity that when I opened my eyes in a well lit bathroom for example I was literally blinded with whiteness covering my eyes and left with white fog in my vision after it faded. This stopped around a month later.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions for yall:\n\n1. What was your medication regimen like? How long did you need them? How long did your doctor allow you prescriptions? When your prescriptions wore out did you need to use OTC pain meds and did they help?\n2. How can I ask more about the pain and antiemetic med regimen I will get without sounding like I am medication seeking, even though I am? The pain from my last surgery was the worst in my entire life, like my concussion I got as a child times 50, constantly for weeks and weeks. Been discriminated for pain relief seeking before, though not at this office, but the way the surgeon did not tell me abt his office policy before my last surgery made me lose trust in him in this aspect.\n3. I know everyone is different, and shunt surgery is different than cyst/tumor removal, but did anyone spend a similar length of time in pain and vomiting *after your shunt surgery* as I spent after my pinealectomy?\n4. Will I most likely also have a similar intensity of light sensitivity as I mentioned under the spoiler?\n5. Is it really easier to recovery from a shunt surgery? Please tell me what your recovery was like, if you are able and willing. \n6. Will the slit ventricles complicate things at all? I briefly read somewhere that people with existing shunts get slit ventricles due to over-draining and that they can obstruct the shunt. What would this mean for me? (I am planning on asking this question to my nurse as well)\n\nLast, if anyone has any encouragement or advice I would really appreciate it. If this thread does not get many replies due to the length I may make another one close to my surgery date for encouragement. I am really scared. So I am coming at it from a bit of a different angle (intraventricular hemorrhage shortly before birth, but to quick answer some things as i can):\n\nI find the light sensitivity is a symptom of issues, that is not a problem for me with the shunt working.\n\nRecovery from surgery is about a week, before I am at least mobile, but it is just generally being sore in the abdomen/neck/head. Listen to your body, find a spot to just stay comfy and do not push your body.\n\nAnd do not let yourself worry, trust your doctor, and follow their message. You got this. I am super confused ... slit ventricles are a sign of over drainage?  Normal pressure is 20 ... so 22 ... I would get a second opinion.  A shunt seems like it would collapse your already slit ventricles? Shunts drain fluid from large ventricles? I am sorry you are in pain ... but I would at the very least get an explanation of how a shunt will help you. Have you tried any medication for the elevated pressure / intercranial hypertension? I have been told patients with pineal gland cysts or tumors are more susceptible to hydrocephalus, and experience it at lower intracranial pressures than are considered \u201cnormal\u201d. What is in a healthy range for someone else is high for pineal patients, hence 22 being a high opening pressure for me. I trust my neurosurgeon as he is a leader in his field and one of the few who specialize in pineal gland cyst/tumors and what happens after, and specializes in hydrocephalus and other rare neuro conditions.. He was also my 4th opinion doctor so I really have absolutely no one left I could go to. Further, my nurse told me my slit ventricles were very abnormal. I have a feeling my previous condition is the reason for the difference in what is considered normal, I know there are different kinds of hydro, and I was not told exactly what kind in the rush of appointments. Asking my nurse details will hopefully help shed some light on this. Coming back to this I wanted to say I am sorry if my response is rude, I was actually kind of panicking when I wrote that and still am. I only know what I wrote in my post and am going to look at my appointment notes rn to see if there is anything in there with more detail. I know they said my case is more complex esp the ventricle part but that is all I remember. My surgeon gets back to his office this tuesday and I am expecting a call then where I will ask for more details and if I learn anything I will update here I guess Thank you for your advice. I do trust my surgeon and his team, they are highly specialized and professional. I am worried now based on another comment below. But I will keep what you said in mind There is something called normal pressure hydrocephalus but slit ventricles would seem to rule out hydrocephalus. The pressure reading does not diagnose hydrocephalus ... the pressure diagnoses hypo or hypertension. Hydrocephalus is large ventricles no matter what the pressure. \n\nI know sometimes intercranial hypertension can be shunted, so maybe that is the case? Especially if your LPs were therapeutic. I do remember somewhere here or on a forum reading someone else have slit ventricles not caused by a shunt with hydro, but I cannot find it again as I read it weeks ago.  \nPerhaps it was only a few slit ventricles, I could not turn my head all the way to look at the scan she showed my mom and I, bc I was fighting off the spinal headache while laying down... And my office notes only list the SNOMEDCT code with the parent hydrocephalus - no subtype dx or other details. Needless to say I will have to wait to confirm or deny any details until I hear from my team. I do not want to keep parroting info that I may have heard wrong or do not remember right :( No worries. It will be an important distinction for possible shunt / symptom monitoring \u2014 there is usually a Goldilocks period after shunt surgery until you find the right valve setting.  CTs can be a common tool in this process and if it is not for hydrocephalus you could run into a shunt setting / possible failure that looks fine drainage wise, but is not because it is treating pressure and not large ventricles. Do you have a good primary doctor?  Mine has been an invaluable hub for all my health junk. \n\n\n\nIt looks like intercranial hypertension is sometimes coded as hydrocephalus ... but man, when I have shunt failure or need to change a valve setting = large ventricles ... you will have to gauge your shunt function without that diagnostic tool. I hope you find relief. Hey friend! \n\nSo reading thought this, it sounds like some of the terror from your last surgery may have been caused by your hydrocephalus. Once you have a working shunt, you should hopefully notice a night and day difference. \n\nIn terms of surgeries, a shunt placement is easy like Sunday morning to these neuro docs. They could do it in their sleep and it is not something to be worried about. Some guys on this sub have had 60+ shunt surgeries in their lives. I say this not to invalidate your feelings, but to reassure you that it is just a walk in the park medically speaking. \n\nIn terms of meds to reduce your intracranial pressure, I am glad you are off those meds imo. I was taking some stuff for a while that just messed me right on up. The shunt will fix you and that is all you will need. No more meds afterwards to govern intracranial pressure. \n\nDepending on where they make your incision, (prolly back right or left) you are ganna be sore and they will give you some pain meds to take for a few days, but it is not that bad. Again, it sounds like you were in so much pain from your last surgery because your brain was a blown up balloon. Once you have a functioning shunt, you will be amazed at how great you feel. But double down on asking and addressing your concern to your doc, what have you got to lose. But, your symptoms should all subside after the shunt placement - light sensitivity and all. (Just FYI - all those symptoms are textbook hydrocephalus symptoms - I get those too with a vengeance whenever I am having a failure - totally normal, albeit fucking terrible)\n\nSlit ventricles in your case from my understanding just means your vents are tiny and rigid, and are able to hold great pressure without physically enlarging. In my case, I have slight slit vent syndrome, but my vents still enlarge when I am having a failure. You should not worry about it 1) because you need a shunt anyway, and it is going to make you feel great and 2) it can lead to people having smaller vents with less pressure, but you have small vents with big pressure, so ideally the pressure gradient will keep the corroidplexus from getting caught in the catheter, which is what those people were referring to with shunt failures and slit vents. \n\nYou can potentially ask for a LP after surgery so you know you are going to be feeling good when you wake up, but honestly just know that once you get the shunt placed it is going to change everything. \n\nDo not worry about this. I know it is easy for a stranger to say on the internet, but just trust that you will feel like a brand new flippin person when you get your pressure under control. \n\nYou are now one of us, friend. We are here for you. Welcome to our ranks. Hey Doc - you can have high pressure and slit ventricle syndrome. Pump the brakes on casting doubt on legit medical advice if you would. Whoa. I do not know if you are qualified to suggest a second opinion or cast doubt on this.  Careful when imposing your opinion/personal experience, she is about I get surgery and does not need a backseat driver. First, do not rely on this forum for some\u2014all of your support.   \n\nI trust most of the comments in this SubReddit but can state with confidence that most chat groups are misleading and incomplete.   You sound a bit vulnerable, and receiving encouragement and positivity is all you need before going into surgery, not opinions and personal experiences\u2014which may cast doubt or uncertainty unless you can spend hours with each individual chatting about the details of their unique experiences.  \n\nMake sense? Hi (27F) My hydro is a result of a brain tumour ( now partially removed).\n\nEssentially I was overproducing csf and after they reduced tumour size still overproducing so needed shunt. First shunt was on right side, pain relief was paracetamol and oromorph.  Recovery was a week, however got an infection which led to laparotomy and appendectomy ( this is not common).\n\nFew weeks of antibiotics, and shunt removed and new placed on left side.\n\nI definitely suffered from light sensitivity ( have an eye mask)  pain management standard pain relief and did not have any once I has left hospital. \n\nN.B uk based so all NHS \n\nHad a few steroids pre tumour surgery and paracetamol/oromorph post. Oromorph I did not find particularly worked and needed a reasonably amount of morphine immediately  post surgery to actually feel the effect but that is likely just me. There was something else beginning with ce bit I cannot remember and they prefer you not to have it if due to be released ( addictive etc)\n\nCaffeine helped me but then maybe it is because I was used to drinking coffee. \n\nAlways ask, you have got nothing to gain by staying quiet and worrying ( serial worrier here) Hey! OMG THIS IS ME (sort of)! First off here are my stats - I am a 28F, I have had a shunt placed due to an arachnoid cyst (2 years old) and have Chiari. I have had 6 revisions. I have Slit Venticle Syndrome. My ventricles are so small and due to overdrainage.\n\n**Everything is going to be okay.**\n\n**Important Facts About Shunts:**\n\n* My revisions were basically due to clogging from the CSF (brain fluid) in the catheter that was placed in the brain. The part that was replaced the MOST was from the neck up. My abdomen shunt has not be replaced in 28 years and it probably so old it will break when a doctor touches it.\n* You can think of it as a big, long plastic tube. Very easy to replace, but can break. It is all luck really. My first shunt lasted 15 years, but after it was replaced, a week later it was revised three times in three weeks. Now, I have had THAT shunt for 5 years. I have heard of people who had their shunt all their life. Just pray!!\n* Symptoms that your shunt is failing: awful headaches, whooshing noises in your ears, nausea, vomiting. you just KNOW. I was puking and had awful headaches. Only Fentanyl took the pain away.\n   * However, the surgery to replace the shunt (45 min surgery) is magic and I was good as new. Stayed over night and walked right out of the hospital.\n\nIf you have any questions, just send me a DM. Yes, you can see it in my neck (just a slight bump) but no one ever asks what it is. It is a pain reliever and I could never live without it.\n\nThe doctors tried Diamox years ago and never worked. Also - my mother and sister were life savers - they drove me to the hospital when it failed. I could not talk to the doctors (because of the pain) and they stayed by my side. The hotel after is not necessary after the surgery. Really no recovery time was needed for me!\n\nShunts are amazing. You will be okay! high pressure can be treated with shunts, but it is not hydrocephalus.  Unless she plans on only ever seeing this out of town doctor is not it important to know the difference? Ventricle size is a metric we use to gauge how well a shunt is or is not working with hydrocephalus. If the baseline is \u201cslit ventricles\u201d that metric does not apply and knowing why would seem to be helpful when navigating any possible issues.  What could be ignored as what looks like overshunted hydrocephalus in radiology could still be symptomatic intercranial hypertension. \n\nIf therapeutic LPs worked then a shunt will be like night and day.  I do hope the OP finds relief. Yes, you make sense! \u201cYou sound a bit vulnerable\u201d you could say that. I am autistic and really struggle with handling this serious condition, often in a medical setting, not to mention my last surgery had been traumatizing. I trust my neurosurgeon and his team, trust his skills, it is just I only saw him for 2-3 mins last appointment and the nurse for maybe 10 minutes while waiting for almost 3 hours... Inbetween that and the LP headache I did not get the time to think up questions that I have now, esp about my ventricle size and what it means for me. I cannot even speak to my nurse or her assistant for the past 2 weeks bc of high call volumes, but I am very distressed when I think about my questions and not knowing the answers. \n\nIt does help me to hear how others\u2019 shunt surgeries went- I really only see stories about revisions and emergency failures and have not seen many first shunt recovery stories so I wanted to know what to expect. That being said I get what you are saying and *do* appreciate hearing from you Sorry for the late reply and I do not have much to say or ask, but thank you. It was really good to hear this and it did help me feel better. I am hoping the shunt can improve my symptoms not related to nausea and headaches but I honestly do not know what to expect. My cognition and memory has been impacted so badly by this that if I am not actively feeling symptoms other than nausea and headache I can barely remember what I go through. I do not really know how I /should/ feel afterwards. Guess that is something I should ask my surgeon in my pre-op appointment?\nAnyways thanks again I appreciate your comment Cool.  You got this! Hope you do not mind a late reply but thank you so much, I felt a lot of relief after reading this. \nFeel free to respond in a DM if you would rather answer privately; I have crowded tonsils and they are slightly lower than normal but I have not gotten any dx of chiari, even my neurosurgeon seems to think it is nothing despite my cousin w chiari saying it probably is slight chiari. Could their position impact the shunt in any way, like drainage, or could it be adding to my symptoms? \n\nDo you have a medical alert bracelet? I was considering one for other conditions a long while ago but am thinking of getting one after my surgery. Also have you found your condition disabling? I am already disabled and afraid that hydro is only lessening my quality of life, is it unrealistic to hope for better functioning with a shunt? My neurosurgeon said it is unlikely my cognition will improve with a shunt, since my hydro and brain cyst impacted my cognition and memory already :/ No worries at all, friend. I trust you judgement and you should too. \n\nTake care and hang tough. This is just a small phase and life is going to be much better on the other side It is extremely rare to over drain without a shunt. I have only come across one or two cases. There is no known medication for hydro.\n\nYou will need a shunt. Your surgery can cause hydro. Best of luck! Hydrocephalus means excess water on the brain. Slit vent means you do not have enough water on the brain. In layman's terms.", "Results Hello, I recently got an MRI result stating that I have inferior vermian hypoplasia with relative prominence of the fourth ventricle.\n\nI read that this may be an indicator of hydrocephalus. Did anyone else have results like this before formal diagnosis? \n\nThanks for reading! Also if this is not the right page to post this in, please let me know and I will take it down. This probably represents a Dandy Walker Malformation or some similar variant. There is an association between DWM and hydrocephalus, but not everyone with DWM has hydrocephalus.

", "Calcification I am concerned my shunt may be calcified. The part behind my ear hurts and I can feel a huge bump there. This has been going on since the better part of last year. I am wondering if anyone has had experience with this? My shunt is 2 years old. My shunt is about 18 months old and I have recently developed a bump along the shunt track and behind my ear. The shunt has always caused some discomfort but now it especially hurts in this location. I did not think it could be calcification so fast. Hopefully someone can answer you as to what this is From what I have heard they coat them in barium nitrate these days so this does not happen.   \n\n\nIf you are concerned, you need to see your neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon is the only one who can help determine what it is I am afraid. I understand being worried to go see them. They can maybe do x-rays or a CT scan or MRI. Share your concerns with your doctor about being in bad condition and not wanting surgery. Yes, it might be....but of course it might be something else too.\n\nMy first shunt was only 15 months old when replaced due to calicification and protein deposits. I felt much better when it was revised. The Shunt the Dr. replaced was so bad, it fell apart in his hands when he removed it from my head.\n\nI think you should be cautious and go see a neurosurgeon about the fact that you are having pain issues behind your ear.

I am in my 30s, and I have had 8 neurosurgeries.\n\nAfter my last surgery I feel like I went a fairly substantial personality shift.\n\nI am still me. I have the same interests and stuff. But also things have changed in a way that I cannot just chalk up to the passage of time and personal growth.\n\nBut I am different. I am calmer, more methodical, more calculating, it feels like the little timid voice in my head has been replaced by like.. Ron Swanson or something. It is like I have been replaced by a super stoic version of myself.\n\nIt makes me wonder if it is happened before. Like when I was younger and cannot really remember.\n\nAnyway, I just wondered if anyone else has felt like this. As though their personality changed in some subtle and/or profound kind of way post surgery? My Neurosurgeon said it was a possibility to have personality changes after a shunt surgery.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not think I did, but thought you would like to know that it can happen, it is not just you. I believe my inner monologue was damaged and I got more awkward after they took out part of my VP shunt, and it makes sense because on the right side of your brain, right where they have the shunt go in, there are a bunch of places that are apparently related to that. My Mom thinks I really changed a lot after my ETV the most, but I think I changed the most when they had to take out more pieces of my calcified broken shunt later on because they left most of them after my ETV and they got infected. Or maybe it was just room the meningitis in general. \n\nAfter my ETV, my doctor I had at the time told me I should start feeling more like myself in a year at the latest, and he was right. No advice after the meningitis adventure though, so that might be permanent.\n\nRegardless of if the change is permanent, you are awesome, and I wish my brain would do that too! it happens I had a third ventriculostomy for my (normal pressure?) hydrocephalus about a month ago ive noticed a huge personality and cognitive shift. Some things are clearer but my decision making is greatly slowed down and groggy. I cant tell if its because ive been through so much in a month or if this is a neurological change due to decreased pressure in my brain and tumor removal I remember when I had one of those! I hope yours sticks for longer than mine. It was nice being able to go on rollercoasters.\n\nI think it is likely due to tumour removal. A third ventri... Yeah I never learned to spell it. It is a tiny hole. Very little structural damage. Removing a tumour would cause much more tissue trauma.\n\nGive it time. The brain heals, and figures itself out over time.

Hey you guys! Have any of you with a VP shunt ever had problems with a \"thumping\", or sometimes even sharp pain sensation around the head, despite feeling fine otherwise? I have had 3 shunt revisions in the last year, and right before the first revision I began having these weird thumping sensations that occurred maybe once every week. It was not a big deal at the time, but it did somewhat bother me because I did not know what was going on. A surgeon I had an appointment with at the time assured me it was just problems with pressure and said it would go away with the next revision. They have continued despite my surgeries, and now they have progressed into this sharp pain that lasts for around 30 seconds at least 4 times a day.

How do you handle it?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe barometric pressure where I am has been high, really high, for over a week now.  It feels like someone strapped a too-small helmet on me and keeps tightening the straps.  Nothing I have done has helped at all, and I am noticing that I am struggling a lot.  Even trying to type this, I keep having to correct myself, my fingers &amp; brain do not seem to be communicating properly at all.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt stands to reason that extra fluid in the skull would be affected by pressure changes, but honestly, it is something the doctors do not really talk about much.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I knew what to do, this is painful.  :( As an aside:  Yes, I have contacted my NS about it, they have no advice.  I do not have any pain meds currently.  The only thing I can do is take Excedrin, use my CBD vape, take some zanaflex, or use muscle cream or my TENs.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have other conditions besides the hydro, but right now the pressure in my skull is the only thing I can think about. &gt;.&lt; This has absolutely been my experience. My doctors have also not spoken much about it either. Any major changes in pressure including incoming rainstorms take a toll. I have not really found that any medications help either. Sleep is the only thing that helps unfortunately.  Sleep does help, if I can manage to fall asleep.  Sometimes the pressure is so much that it hurts to put my head on the pillow. \n\nPlus, I do not think it is a great idea to sleep for a week straight, no matter how lovely it sounds.  Humans should not hibernate. :D Yep, 110%. Incoming storms make me feel like I am walking on the moon or something. \n\nI usually just sleep, but for long lasting pressure changes I have not found anything that helps much. Sometimes if my CSF levels go too high I will press the valve to force the shunt to drain. I have got a defect in my skull though that makes it very easy to check what my levels are doing. Might be a bit harder for others. Like, press where the NS does to see how it is draining?  I did not think of that.  \n\nThe barometer has been high for over a week now, this is miserable. Sleep, hydration, taking an allergy med helps me most days. Ibuprofen is also my best friend on bad weather days. Yep, use with caution though. If you press it too much you are in for more hurt Yup.  My last Neurologist did not even want me to touch it.  I am like, \"um, no, it is in *my* body, I want to know what it does &amp; if I want to touch it, I am going to.\"  XD\n\nI would assume too much pressing causes overdrainage, right?  That would be why it would hurt more. I guess that if you screw around with it too much you might be at risk of damaging it like anything else. I have ongoing pressure fluctuations and have been doing manual drains for years without any issues though.\n\nYep, that is exactly right. And it is a lot easier to deal with underdrainage than overdrainage. You can manually drain using the valve but if you overdo it, you cannot put more CSF in.  Right.  That is why I had so much trouble when the MRI screwed up my setting, it was overdraining. That was a horrid 24 hours. Yep. Overdrainage is a nightmare.

The way failures present themselves in my situation are really atypical, and I only get headaches. Going to have an ETV next month, and really nervous because of some horror stories, it seems like an incredibly more risky surgery, where shunt surgeries are pretty routine for me, and I have always been out of the hospital the next day, fully recovered within a week.   \nTo anyone who had an ETV done, was it much different than a shunt operation in terms of how you felt after compared to shunt surgery? My son had an ETV and a shunt surgery a year later. (Not because etv failed). He was only 4 months old and seemed a bit dizzy and confused when he woke up and agitated for about 12 hours. Then it was like a switch flicked and he was almost normal. We we are home in 2 days. He got a pocket of fluid built up where his etv hole was made that never really went down. He did really well with it I hope it works for you too. I had an ETV performed 2 years ago. \n\nAlthough the ETV closed back up and I had to eventually get a shunt, the surgery itself was uneventful and I went home the next day.  As far as compared to a shunt surgery, recovery for me was about the same. I was in the same boat! I had a few bad shunt revisions and got an ETV 1.5 years ago.  I found waking up I was pretty clear, though as reported there was some dizziness. Most of it subsided quickly though for a few months I had little dizzy moments for a few seconds at a time, now I do not have them.  I recovered well within 8 weeks and was back to health, exercising, all the usual things. Wishing you all the best! I have had an ETV surgery a little under a year ago and the recovery was a little different from the shunt recovery. You may feel as if your in a dream for the first couple of days and you will be bed-ridden for the following week. And, without trying to scare you, even morphine does not help completely (to be fair when I got mine my ventricles were huge causing a near-death experience), it only takes away about two thirds of the pain. It also kind of presents itself as a migraine so you will want to stay in a dark and quiet room most of the time. About a week and a half to two weeks after the surgery is when you will start to feel as if you can walk around again (normally) and it will feel as if you were hit by a truck when you get up and move in any way. The whole recovery process may take up to almost a month until you feel like yourself again. It is different for everyone so what I explained may not be true for you. Released from the hospital two days after surgery. At my parents for a week before going back home. Good luck! It was nice to not have much hair shaved. How did it go", "Hydrocephalus is overwhelming. My journey with this condition started last year with the resection of a brain tumor with a cystic mass, and has been up and down ever since. I have had multiple shunt adjustments, all of which only brought a few weeks of relief from my headache and neurological symptoms. I was alerted to a shunt recall of my shunt, which I am still confused about whether or not has impacted my symptoms. I am now seeing a second neurosurgeon as the first who dx me and placed the shunt retired, right around the time I was alerted to the recall. \n\nThe new surgeon has specialized in shunts for 30 years, yet does not acknowledge or seem to believe a key piece of knowledge about my hydrocephalus that previous surgeon imparted on me. He was a specialist with pineal cysts and tumors, and has said the research and experience of his patients shows that we experience hydrocephalus at lower opening pressures than most people. My new surgeon is contesting my hydrocephalus, suggesting I never had it in the first place and that it is idiopathic intracranial hypertension instead. Regardless of that, which he says is merely semantics, he is suggesting that either the shunt was a temporary measure or it is malfunctioned according to the recall. \n\nI went with his least invasive option, trying a shunt ligation, instead of a complete revision because he said if he decides the shunt and I still have the symptoms then I would still need a ligation\u2026. A third lumbar puncture, and another surgery which is far more painful than I was told, I am sitting with the same headache I had pre-op except it is not positional anymore, which is just like my symptoms before the shunt was placed. My chest (where the ligation was done a week ago) feels like it will crack open, the tubing is tighter and restricts my movements more than ever, it hurts all along the tubing and where it goes into my head, I cannot seem to stop hunching over when I am upright, I walk like an elderly person, I still have the same neurological symptoms as before, I cannot seem to see straight and my eyes feel like they are being forced to go cross eyed at times. \n\nI am getting the stitches out in 2 days where I will not even get to see the surgeon but his NP who I have never met. I did not get to see the surgeon after my surgery (while lucid- he visited me apparently while I was still under anesthesia) to discuss symptoms that indicate an emergency/ returning hydrocephalus. Once again I am posting here, sad about my journey and all of the pain, and overwhelmed about not knowing what is going to happen to me\u2026 and doubting the neurosurgeon despite his very nice and patient demeanor with my \u201ccomplex\u201d case. If anyone has read this far thank you. I am hoping someone can relate\u2026", "pregnant with a shunt? Is anyone here shunted to treat IIH or hydrocephalus and been through a successful pregnancy? I have a non-cancerous growth in my brain that causes some CSF blockage, and had a VP shunt placed about 4 years ago.\n\nOne gynecologist told me if I ever got pregnant I would have to have a C section (presumably because of the intracranial pressure associated with pushing), but this has yet to be confirmed by anyone. (I have heard that C-sections in shunted patients can be a bit tricky, so I am worried about that, too...)\n\nAnyway, I am just wondering if anyone here has any experience in dealing with this..\n\nAnyone?", "EVT surgery recovery time?

Even after a short walk i immediately feel that the pressure starts to increase in my head and i start to feel dizzy. Im a little worried because i will have to work again soon but im not able to...\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with how long it takes to recover?\n\nThank you in advance for your help. Assuming you mean ETV. I had one 12 weeks ago now and I will agree it took a while to really recover. It was more gradual than anything, but the timing was probably past week 6. As of now i feel fully recovered, though I still get the occasional dizzy spell, though was told that is fine, and is probably just from adjusting to the new pressure.  Good luck! Yes ETV, sorry :) I modified my post.\n\nThank you for your reply and good luck to you too. ", "Can you feel your shunt pumping? I have a programmable shunt. Every time I go in to see my neurosurgeon (assigned by my insurance, but he did not place the shunt), he always feels the shunt with his fingers. He says that he can feel it pumping. \n\nWhat I do not get is, since I have a programmable shunt, cant\u2019t/should not he use a device to test it? So, I am wondering, can you feel your shunt pumping? Have you felt it? My son has a VP (programmable ) shunt. They have a device to check it is setting to make sure it is pumping at the correct output. Anytime he gets an mri or has seizures or anything of the sort they check it. Even at his neurological check ups they check it. Fairly simple looking device and quick to check it. Normally my Neurosurgeon \"feels\" where the shunt is (I have a Programmable Codman-Hickman) but to make sure that it is programmed to the right setting, YES, he uses a device that is in what looks like a small suitcase.\n\nI go to a Chief Neurosurgeon, Professor/Chair of the Neurosurgery dept. and I have had my recent shunt for 19 yrs and I have never heard the Dr. say \"he can feel the shunt pumping\"? Sorry.....but if your doctor did not seem concerned, I guess I would not either.\n\nYes, they usually use a device to test them.\n\nWhy not call the office and ask this question? That is the brand I have. The neurosurgeon that I have now does not seem easy to talk to. The last time I went to him, because I was having headaches and thought it might have been my shunt, he was already talking about going in and replacing it. He did not seem to want to get the device to check it. He said he could feel it pumping, but If it is bothering me, he could always do surgery. Can you switch Neurosurgeons? There is  nothing WORSE than going to a Neurosurgeon that you have trouble talking to. You should feel at ease talking to a neurosurgeon. I would see about changing doctors.\n\nGood luck. no. I cannot feel it whatsoever. Thank you. \n\nYeah. That is my plan. I am thinking I could either ask my primary doctor to get my another referral, through my insurance, or I could go to the neurosurgeon who originally put in this shunt. The only thing is, his office does not work with my insurance. So, I would have to pay out of pocket. I would probably be willing to do that, if it is not too much. Ugh I hate when they do this. My NP always uses the little magnet boy to check the setting and then presses the shit out of it to test the flow and it hurts", "Does anyone had two shunts? ", "Hello and Thank you! My girlfriend went in for an eye exam and they recommended an emergency mri once they noticed swelling on her ocular nerve. The next day the neurologist diagnosed her with obstructive hydrocephalus. It explains the degenerative nature of her vision and the poor peripheral vision. They installed a vp shunt a few days after and it is taking some getting used to. She is sleeping a lot with poor appetite and nausea and vomiting when she does eat. My question is to those with pv shunts, how was your first few days after surgery? We are they similar? How long did it take to possibly even out? I have been reading around this community and applaud you all for sharing your stories and thank you all for having this subreddit. It has really comforted us to know we are not alone. This sounds like my story completely - my brain tumour (causing hydrocephalus) was noticed following an eye exam where they spotted pressure/swelling on the optic nerve, or papilledema.\n\nIn the day following my VP shunt surgery, I felt like I had the worst hangover of my life. I had such a throbbing headache, I felt nauseous, I was sleeping a lot. My consultant visited my bedside and I complained of these symptoms, and he suggested that the shunt was \u2018over draining\u2019. Basically it had been set at a level that meant it was sucking out the CSF at too fast a rate, basically dehydrating my brain. My shunt is programmable, do you remember if they told you that whether hers is programmable/adjustable or not? All they did for me was put this cool compass-like magnet thing against my head (i was just sitting up in bed, it is not an operation) and twist it. They changed the suction rate to make it suck less vigorously, I suppose? And then after that, within a few hours I felt better and I genuinely did not have a headache or feel nauseous for months. I could not believe it. I had forgotten what life was like without a headache. \n\nThe only other thing though is that I struggled to sleep for the first couple of weeks, as getting used to having a tube down the inside of your neck takes some time. It is basically bruised at the moment, and it was so painful to sleep on. I felt like I was trying to fall asleep on top of a biro pen. Tell her that gets better, and I do not feel it at all anymore.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to message me I might be able to help. I have had 2 shunt surgeries (one fitting, one shunt revision following a blockage) as well as a brain surgery to remove (most of) a tumour. I have experience of the shunt failing as well which might be helpful if you ever want to know the symptoms. :) I have a pretty similar story too - my optometrist saw my optic nerve was swollen and sent me in for a ct scan.  They found a tumor causing obstructive hydrocephalus.   The first surgery I had was an etv, but a few months later the bypass closed back up and my symptoms returned (losing my balance, dementia like symptoms etc.). \n\nI went back in for surgery in December, and had a VP shunt placed. Everything has been great since then other than they think that possibly the tumor is getting slightly bigger on my last MRI.  I have a MRA (mri angiogram) next week so my neuro can see the blood flow to the tumor.  Unfortunately, even though it is benign it is highly vascular so they are reluctant to remove until they get a better idea of the blood circulation to it. Hope you are doing ok. I really noticed you said \u201ceverything has been great since\u201d.  One thing that has always rung true for me (obviously, I am not a doctor though to take this with a pinch of salt) is that I am the first to know if there is any problems with my tumour or my shunt. I had a couple of strokes a year or two ago and the MRI and CT scans did not show anything. My consultant was adamant with the symptoms I was showing that my shunt must be blocked, and suggested they operate to see. The *entire shunt* was completely blocked, but none of it showed on scans. Similarly, in the first year post my first surgery (which was just tumour removal, before I got a shunt), the tumour was growing which was showing on the scans, but they declined to do any surgery as it was not causing me any symptoms.\n\nI used to get so anxious waiting for MRI results and meetings with my consultant, but 4 years on I have learned to trust my body. If I have headaches multiple days in a row, feel excessively tired relative to how much sleep I have had and how busy I have been, or feel nauseous when I wake up, I know something is wrong. Otherwise, everything\u2019s probably fine. :) it is nice to meet someone with a similar story! I had a shunt malfunction scare two weeks ago. Was admitted into a hospital and put on diamox to reduce the optic nerve swelling. Shunts take time and even when she is up moving around, does not mean she is 100% herself again. Brain surgery is the only treatment for hydrocephalus. I applaud you for being by her side! Thank you for your response, and I am sorry to hear about your malfunction. How did you know you were experiencing a malfunction? What were your symptoms and how did they confirm the malfunction? Also if you do not mind me asking, how long have you had your shunt? Diamox is what they gave her in the hospital stay in the 3 days leading up to her surgery. The neurosurgeon said it would help thin the csf but did not recommend it for her long term being as it would cause tingling in the fingers and extremities. It turned out not being a malfunction this time but my malfunctions include dizziness and head pressure. Makes a migraine seem like a cake walk Thank you so much, I read this to my gf and your story has really comforted us and made us feel like we are no longer alone and just waiting for an appointment or something bad to happen.\n\nShe does have the programmable pv shunt and the doctor said it was \u201cset to 10\u201d whatever unit that is, I do not know. I am afraid those symptoms of over draining sound very close to hers. Her surgery was Tuesday and if it has not subsided by tomorrow (Saturday) we may have to go to the ER. I hate to in-debt us even more but her follow up with the Neurosurgeon is not for another 3 weeks. Oh I am so sorry you have to worry about the cost! America genuinely sucks. If it helps, the \u2018procedure\u2019, if you can even call it that, took about 30 seconds and is painless. Rather than going to the ER do you have a number for your neuro team? You can tell them your symptoms, and suggest that you have done some research and you think it might be over draining. Perhaps they will give you an appointment to adjust the settings that might bypass all the ER costs etc? Mine was also set to 10 initially and it was just horrible, mine is now set at 8 and I very rarely have headaches at all. It sounds like a VP shunt overdrainage. I have the same problem. Im \u00edn the hospital and my shunt Will be replaced \u00edn a few days...I hope at the latest on tuesday. Now I have a sophysa sm8 mini 30-200 and I Will get a 80-400.", "Hydrocephalus/Facial Pain Good Evening.\n\nIn November 2020 I discovered a new form of pain all over my face. Especially over my nose, cheeks and forehead. I went to hospital and they made an Computed Tomography of my head and discovered that I may have Hydrocephalus because my ventricles are larger than usual.\n\nThen I went to an hospital and they made an lumbar puncture and my pressure was hig but not that high. And they told me that my symptoms are not usual for Hydrocephalus because I only had heavy facial pains und pain on the forehead. \n\nThey were so painful I did not know that something like that was even possible. A burning and tearing all over my face. \n\nSince that day the pain never leaved me in peace. And no Painkiller helped me. They even tried opioids but they did not help. \n\nAnd after Months I started getting Jaw Pains and the doc discovered a crossbite but he did not recommend a brace before I clarified the facial pain bc it can get worse.\n\nThey made any test and an MRI of my head and body and did not find the reason for the Hydrocephalus?! They called it a normal pressure Hydrocephalus. And I think I have it since I was born bc my head is a little bit bigger that usual. But never had or feeled a pain like that.\n\nThey gave me Diamox und some anti-epileptic drugs for the chronic pain but no improvement yet. \n\nDoes anybody have/had some similar symptoms with Hydrocephalus? \n\nSome side Information: Male, 25 Years, 120kg at 1,88m, Electronic Engineer That pain sounds like an issue with your trigeminal nerve.", "Has anyone had a shuntogram done before? Was it painful? I am getting this in combination with a ct scan in 2 days, after having no relief from my first setting change a month or so ago. \nI am terrified of needles&amp; needle pain, and my shunt where it goes in my head and along my tubing line has been hurting a lot lately, I am hoping this does not add to that. Do they have to shave my hair where my shunt is, even if my hair is still short and sparse there from the surgery? I just stopped wearing hats and scarves to cover my shunt :( No, it is not painful. You will not feel anything. They will not shave a little bit of the side of your head where your shunt is...unless they determine your shunt is in malfunction and have to do an emergency surgery. I do not have an adjustable shunt, so it is not the exact same situation, but I just had a shuntogram done last month (came back negative, unfortunately the shunt *was* broken so I ended up having surgery).\n\nTo your first question: it is not painful, honestly. You will feel something, but it is like someone is poking your head with a pencil (this is the best way I can think to describe it). It feels totally different than getting a shot or typical needle stick.\n\nAs for the haircut: they did not cut my hair at all, outside of my surgery. They maybe used a marker when they did the shuntogram to mark something on my head, but I am not 100% sure on that. I am 100% sure I did not have to get any hair cut, though. And for context, I have short, prototypically-male hair.\n\nHope this helps! i was in the emergency room last night for possible shunt complications (turns out i have slit ventricles), but they had to run a shuntogram per standard protocol. it was a series of x-ray images, which took less than 5 minutes, and a head CT without contrast that took about 2 minutes. \nthe x-ray was simple, you could stand or lie down. i stood, and they took images of the chest, neck, side of the head and also had me turn my head to angle the shunt towards the x-ray machine. for the ct, you lie flat for approximately 2 minutes and they do all the work. \ni hope this relieves some of your anxiety over the shuntogram. it was super simple and painless. \ni hope you get some good results, wishing you the best.\n\nedit to add there is no haircut/shaving involved. \n\nsecond edit to add my shunt was placed in oct 2019. i have been symptomatic since placement, and also have not found any relief with shunt setting changes. i sympathize with your post, and i sincerely hope you find relief soon.", "COMPLICATIONS/SYMPTOMS?

I have had a VP Shunt for 27 years. I forget to pump it for long periods of time. I can hear it \"buzz\" when it drains sometimes when I am laying down. I am curious how often do you pump your Shunt? I have a Cordis Hakim \" Brown Valve\" with an anti siphoning device. You... You have a manual shunt? That sounds HORRIFYING. Like... I am not judging you, but I am saying I could not do that. So umm... Good job... Maybe set an alarm to remember?\n\nSorry not to be helpful,\n\nA person who is super squeamish about having their shunt touched, at all, ever, by anyone. I do not pump the valve at all. If I nudge my head or lie on my side and it gets pressed in, no harm done, but I do not do it routinely. I used to do it a lot when I was a child \ud83d\ude02 but my shunt overdrains now, so I tend to stay away from things that exacerbate that. No no no... it is not completely manual.. it drains on it is own. I was just told to pump it every so often to help clear it out. There is a space on it that I have to push on with a finger to I guess clear it out every so often. The Dr. did not say \" do it this many times a month/day/year..\"\nThat is why I posted the question. I was just curious what other people do. My shunt is not programmable.\nOh and its not a big deal for me to touch it. Some people I meet get freaked out by it. Some people are curious and do not mind seeing what it feels like. Ok cool. Thanks for replying. Hmm. That is interesting! My surgeon knows I am a bit 'zany'...so I was told not to pump the shunt because otherwise *poke* *poke* *poke* \n\nI do not _think_ you would need to be systematic about it, just when you remember... that is very vague advice! Hmm. Hope you get sorted. Thanks. I was just curious what other people were told. I have been told to never pump the shunt. Only my neurosurgeon will pump it. However, on the hydro association website I found this.  \u201cAntechambers/Reservoirs\n\nAn antechamber is a sampling chamber or reservoir located under the skin between the inflow catheter and the valve. They can be used to sample CSF in the shunt, inject drugs into the brain through the proximal catheter, and measure pressure. In addition, these \u201cbubbles\u201d can be felt through the skin and pumped manually to help keep the shunt open. In general, if one pushes on the reservoir and it does not spring back, then there might be an obstruction in the proximal catheter because the reservoir is not filling with CSF. On the other hand, if the reservoir feels rather stiff and more force is needed to depress it, then the distal catheter may be clogged. Some clinicians recommend pumping the reservoir periodically to help keep the shunt open.\u201d My Dad used to do that when I head a headache. Now I am sure if I did that I would crack the thing (30 years and counting). That is what I was told. To pump it to \"clear it out\" occasionally.I guess  the proteins in CSF can build up somehow? I got a shunt in the early 90s, but I cannot remember the year. Are you supposed to do that, or is it only certain shunts? Early 90s? I got mine in '93 myself. I guess it must just be certain shunts? I know some people have programmable shunts that work with magnets or something like that? Mine just has a spot that feels like a hard piece of hose that you can depress with one finger. It has some kind of device/connection that keeps it from draining too fast. I was told my Hydrocephalus was so for gone that if I had a \"normal shunt\" put in it would drain too fast and I would not make it. It drains normally on its own but I was told to pump it occasionally to help  \"clear it out\".", "Can arrested hydrocephalus become active again?  I am not sure what you mean by \"arresteds\".  However, it IS possible to go for a period without issues and then have them again.  So long as you routinely visit your neurologist to ensure your shunt is still fully functioning, you should be fine. Arrested means that I have not shown symptoms for a long time.\n\nMy shunt has migrated and is not in my stomach cavity anymore but my neuro said it is ok because having had it in for so long, the tissues built around it creating a pathway.\n\nHe said keep it in just in case something happens That is what I figured.  I am glad you are keeping it in place.  I was told decades ago I had outgrown the condition, so no doctors ever considered hydrocephalus when I had headaches, etc.  It ended up I had NOT outgrown the condition.  My shunt was malfunctioning for years, and by the time it was caught and replaced it was too late.  Now I am blind as a result.  So, always keep up with checkups and always make your doctors aware of your condition! Yes, that is definitive possible. Never thought after almost 17 years with almost no problems i would have to think about hydrocephalus again.\n\nBut it came back worse than ever.\n\nSo please do regular checkups...brain mri's and get your eyes checked regulary for papilledema or if available even try to get OCT scans from time to time. They can come but chances are not that high. We do not know how many us are born with arrested hydro and lived our life with arrested hydrocephalus. \n\nMy wife has arrested hydro which was diagnosed by chance due to a ct for routine migraine headaches. It was with her since her birth probably. Arrested hydrocephalus due congenital aqueductal stenosis. \n\nDocs upon further evaluation said it mostly will remain as it is for life. But few docs also suggested to get periodically checked. Yes its possible.  I have compensated hydro, which you can also call arrested. Born with it but did not know of it until 29. I go for a MRI every two years to check.  Its been 12 years and no changes.  Docs have pretty much agreed that if it decompensates, it would be very slow and regular checkups will catch it. Please do checkups, maybe changes will be even earlier noticable on the eyes than on the mris of the brain.

My shunt was from 89 so almost as old as yours Ok. I might go see a gp tomorrow.

I have been noticing symptoms of Shunt failure and I would like second opinions. First off, I feel very lethargic throughout the day even with a night of 8 to 9 hours of sleep, but also I do have trouble falling asleep. But also I have been getting headaches pretty frequently, they are not horrible ones but they are just there. Another thing I notice is at times my vision will become all blurry for about a minute and it will go back to normal. The final thing I notice is loss of coordination. I will lose my balance while walking and I will just be all over the place until I can pull myself up. I got diagnosed with a minor concussion a few months ago by my Neurologist and so nobody wants to take me back to get a brain scan. All I want is some support on what to do. Have you talked to your parents regarding your symptoms? If your shunt is failing, it is in the very early stages. It is worth getting a scan just to be sure, but do not be surprised if nothing shows up.\nIf you have had your shunt for that long, there is also a chance that you might have outgrown it. Had you had any growth spurts around when the symptoms started?\nHave a chat to your parents/guardians and make sure they are aware of your symptoms at least. That way they can keep an eye on things and see about getting a scan organised. I would definitely talk to your guardians. It can feel scary, but you have support!", "I feel alone I feel alone... Elaborate. You definitely are not alone. That is kind of a big part of what this sub is for.

It is been years and even though I live in a big city I have still never seen or heard anything. I know I have interacted with Hydrocephalus people, but it is a pretty easily hidden condition. It is definitely made it easy at times for our family to feel isolated. Hi. Let us chat :)", "For those who have had a shunt installed later in life... Have you ever got to the point where you are not constantly aware of the 'new one'. I had three surgeries as an infant and things were then 'under control' until 2003, when I had another shunt installed.\n\nThe problem is that it still (16 years later) drives me nuts. I am constantly aware of 'something' being there underneath the skin but above the skull. To make things even more annoying, the placement of the shunt is such that whether I lay on my back or my right side the entire weight of my head pushes down directly on the reservoir - laying on the other side is not so wise for the heart so I try to avoid that but this means that when I lay down my head is turned 90 degrees to the left to avoid pressure on the shunt, but that results in a sore/stiff neck.\n\nI spend as much of everyday medicating with medical marijuana to take myself 'out of my head' as I can while still functioning on the most basic of levels (basic errands get done, but work has not been possible on anything resembling a regular basis for more than a decade).\n\nThe thing is: my neurosurgeon says that the shunt is functioning normal so there is nothing that he will do.\n\nI just want to put my head through a wall. Constantly. I became aware of it after a couple years but slowly adjusted to just feeling like it was part of normal life. Maybe for 7-8 years.  Just recently I had it taken out and put with an ETV so I had to adjust again hahaha. It takes time but after a while you will feel that no one lives life differently. I had my first shunt in at 12 btw. My first two were put in as an infant, so I have no concept of life without them, but this one is just always 'there'... I feel it sitting above the ear and under the skin and it is just...really fucking annoying. Interesting. I am still sure you will adapt, and hope that the issues you are having resolve! I got my first one placed at 21 and did not have it redone until I was 42.  I recently had a new one put in this past June and I absolutely HATE it.

I am miserable I had a shunt placed at birth and was fine until age 10, needed a revision and was again headache free until about age 17. At age 17 I started to get headaches, or a pressure pain that came and stayed. I would constantly go to the ER, ventricles would always be slit and they would say it is overdraining, but it is working, and send me home. Eventually, at age 20 it failed and my ventricles got bigger. They replaced it and I felt great relief... for 2 weeks then my headaches came back and stayed again. Of course my surgeon said it is just a matter of finding the right setting... but after trying all the settings, none helped, going too high gave me an under drainage headache, and too low gave me a constant low grade pressure feeling, we could not find the middle ground. Then a year later he tried to revise it again and add an anti siphon device... same thing happened... small ventricles (unless they turned it to a high setting)... constant headache... etc. He told me I was a candidate for an ETV because I have aqueductal stenosis, and I had it done a couple months ago. I felt some relief with the ETV, my headache was better, but still there, unfortunately it failed after 2 weeks and they had to turn my shunt back on... as soon as they did that, the constant headache returned and here I am again. Also, during my ETV they left my shunt in and tested it, they said it worked great and there was no issue with it. \n\nI am 23 and I am miserable living like this, I have a pressure feeling \"headache\" in my head 24/7. It is not positional, does not get better by doing anything, and it seems the shunts are not working for me or I have outgrown them. I have an appointment on Monday with my surgeon, just curious if anyone else deals with these headaches EVERY hour of every day. It really impacts my life and I originally thought there would eventually be relief, but after 3 surgeries, nothing has worked. Although my ventricles are small, I have a headache every day and I constantly worry that this is not good for me long term and that it is causing long term damage to my brain, I hope I am wrong. \n\nBecause of these headaches I have had to call off going to school, I havent worked in a year, and I stay pretty low most of the time. I hate it. I may just force myself to live with it and power through school and work I suppose, I may have no other choice but to just \"deal with it\". \n\nThey wanted me to go to neurology before I had the ETV but I declined because I thought the ETV would fix my issues, I think I will see neurology because I have read that sometimes chronic-shunt related headaches can be relieved by migraine therapy. If anyone else has had success with that please let me know. Since the mid 90s I have had at least some head pain every day other than for about 6 weeks after my last shunt insertion in '03.  A 'good' day ranks as a 6/10 on the pain scale, most are around 8.  I have cycled through so many meds that I could not name half of them.  I switched to medical cannabis about a decade ago, and while not ideal for some, or 100% effective, it has cut down on the number of ER runs I have done out of extreme caution significantly.\n\nI am still constantly aware of the newest shunt and it legitimately drives me bonkers. Sorry to hear that you have been in pain that long, though I guess it is comforting to know it is something that is able to be \"lived with\"... same with me, pain is daily about a 5-6 / 10. Not enough that I am 100% miserable, but enough to bother me. \n\nHave you tried just CBD? I used to use marijuana but it started to cause a lot of anxiety for me, so I have been looking into trying just CBD but not sure if it would help. Lastly, do you have small ventricles? I order 3 jars a month usually: one CBD dominant for the times when my body just needs to chill out, one with a moderate CBD/THC mix for general management, and one that is as potent of a THC concentration as I can possibly order at the time for the (sadly most commmon) times where I just need to get the hell out of my brain and get as far away as possible. Have they ever looked at a possible Chiari Malformation? \nI was in constant pain for 10+ years. Everybody always looked at the shunt, untill the doctor I went to see was called into the ER and his collegue took over. He saw a tiny abnormality on a scan, and surgery cured me of the excruciating pain two weeks later.\n\nI have been pain free ever since When I was little they mentioned a suspicion but must have ruled it out since I have had probably around 50 CT + MRIs since then... but ill ask about it during my appointment to double check, thanks for the reply. I see, I am going to give the CBD a try next month. Thanks for the reply. No problem, hope it helps. Same. Over 50 MRIs and CTs, nobody saw it.\nUntill this guy came along. It is definately worth checking OH MY GOSH!!! I have the EXACT same issue! I am 16M and I have had a headache 24/7 since I was 12 and I think I have had a total of maybe 2-3 days during this time where it gets a little better, other than that I am miserable almost all the time. Since this headache started I have had about 8-9 surgeries and each one made it a little worse. My neurosurgeon says the same thing that the ventricles are not enlarged but there has been times where they do get huge when my shunt fails. The last time it failed (about 13-14 months ago) I had an ETV placed with the shunts close to off but none of this gave me relieve. I too have slit-ventricle syndrome which causes everything to look normal. I was told that all of this will go away when I stop growing but I find that hard to believe. This is a good call. You should have your pressure monitored. Grind your specialists for answers.  Do not settle, keep asking questions and do not rule out mental health\u2014perhaps some supplemental talk therapy and or meds will help.  You are pain is real, and it is terrible, let us do something about it.  \n\nI live in paid every day, most athletes live in pain everyday, if there is any way to uncover a mental health issue causing pain then this will be easiest piece to solve\u2014if you are willing. \n\nGood luck and keep us posted. Same with me, the revisions I have had have seem to made my headache a little worse each time. I have not been diagnosed with slit ventricle syndrome, it seems like it is hard for some neurosurgeons to diagnose or they miss it entirely, but I think I have some form of it unfortunately. Have you tried things like an anti siphon device or different shunt? Those havent worked for me yet. I have tried putting in a second shunt but it does not really help. I have heard that neurosurgeons basically only know how to perform the surgery, very few actually know other stuff about hydrocephalus. With slit ventricle syndrome I would suggest making an appointment with a neurologist, that is what I am going to do in the near future. I have heard that people usually get a little more info from that. I was in constant pain until age 6. My doctor's finally moved the shunt to the top of my head and installed a gravity device where my shunt was. I have been headache free ever since. I am so sorry :-(.  I struggle with the exact same issues.  I was diagnosed with hydrocephalus several years ago when I was 25.  Ive had 4 shunts, but was never a candidate for ETV.  Every time I have a surgery my symptoms instantly get better as soon as I wake up from surgery but then slowly start to get worse again.  I have a lot of balance problems to go along with the headache issues. I also have some memory issues but my doctors think its just from all the surgeries in a short amount of time recently. Ive had some relief before when adjusting the shunt, but its always short-lived and gets worse again.  My balance issues really concern me, its hard to get around my house and it would be impossible to work.\n\nMy ventricles are currently \"slit like\", which doesnt seem to concern my doctors.  It seems to make sense to me that im still overdraining, but the last time I talked to them they were against adjusting my shunt again.\n\nNot sure what else to do because I cant function like this.  Ive wanted to try to go to Johns Hopkins because ive read about how they specialize in spinal fluid disorders (and theyre on all of the hydro association videos), but my insurance doesnt cover them. Not sure it would make a difference anyways, ive seen so many neurosurgeons and neurologists from good hospitals...they couldnt possibly know anything different at JH could they?\n\nI recently started CBD and feel maybe the tiniest bit better, but its hard to tell.  Ill definitely be looking into medical cannabis in the future.  Willing to give anything a shot at this point.\n\nLet me know if you ever find anything that works! :-)", "Can enlarged pupil in one eye can be a symptom of failure VP shunt? Hello. \n\nI noticed that pupil in my left eye is little enlarged. Not something big, but i am worried asf. I have my VP shunt since my birth, never revised and i am 24M. Someone had symptoms like that when shunt was faulty or it can be something worse like a tumor? I do not have any other symptoms. I have made appointment with neurosurgeon for Friday but i am scared that can be something worse than faulty shunt... One enlarged pupil is a blown pupil. Can mean many things, one of which can be pressure in head. Look up pictures though because its usually very very noticeable. Potentially optic nerve swelling, potentially due to intracranial pressure. Are you having headaches, nausea and blurred vision as well? No nothing like this. I had weak headaches for 2 days but now I am feeling just right. The difference between two eyes is small, maybe very small and maybe I am exaggerate this. Hmm...any change in vision? Or any other symptoms besides the pupil dilation? \n\nAny falls or head impacts recently?  Unfortunately its not that.  My vision is same as before, did not had any falls or impacts in my head recently. Im feeling anxiety about my life for about month now maybe should I go to psychiatrist instead of neuro surgeon lol. Idk that that is an \u2018unfortunately\u2019 in my book, but I trust your judgement. \n\nLife has been tough for lots of people and I would not discount the the stress factor. \n\nIf you are not presenting other symptoms such as blurred vision or intense, daily headache, it does not sound like a shunt failure. That said, you know your body and should trust how you are feeling. \n\nTry to take some time to relax, if possible, and just be super mindful of your symptoms. Do not spend a bunch of time checking your pupil dilation. Take time to rest and assess what and how you are feeling. This can help calm down those anxieties and will also give you concrete symptoms to talk to your neuro doc about. \n\nHang in there. We are here for you Yes. Do you have a neuro-opthalmologist? Can you get in to see your eye doctor to check your optic nerve in that eye? Can you have your shunt valve opened any more? I get a major dilated pupil and a lag in light response as one of my \u201cred flags\u201d for a shunt issue. How small a difference? Can you see if someone else notices? When this happens to me one pupil is like shark pupil status. Super noticeable. I think it is still worth an ophthalmologist dilating your eyes and having a look at your optic nerves, if you could get to one. It is such an easy way to check for pressure. Vision is V valuable \ud83d\ude1c Yes. In fact, it is one of the main symptoms. It is noticeable if you look closely. It was noticed by doctor when he was checking that my pupils are reacting for light, etc. The enlarged pupil is on left side so this the side where is a installed vp shunt in back of my head. My shunt is old shunt, so it cannot be controlled. I have never revised my shunt, have same shunt for 24 years now. Have you figured anything out? Hope you are doing well (: Well, it was all probably due to some kind of anxiety disorder or neurosis caused by hypochondria. I visited a neurosurgeon, he said that my shunt is not working anymore, and I probably do not need it, but ofc they cannot remove it due that I have it since my birth. Today I had CT Scan just in case if something was wrong.", "Does anyone know the reason why some people with hydrocephalus/shunts get bad headaches when we have a cold or a flu? Posting a blog series about hydro headaches, and could not find any explanation for this online. Different pressure levels in head. I have a programmable shunt. Low csf u feel gross sluggish vommit neck pain. High csf pressure monster headache is usually the main one for me. Flu will make things worse usually increasing head pressure resulting in an increase in headache.\n\nConstant coughing rapidly increases pressure and decreases Weird i have never experienced bad headaches other when my shunt has failed and needed replacing", "Seizures Does anyone here get seizures from hydrocephalus? Docs say my CT scans and ventricles look good, but for some reason I had a seizure last week. Apparently some epilepsy is relatively common with people who have hydrocephalus.  for what it is worth I am a parent of a kid with hydrocephalus and do not have it myself. I have had multiple non epileptic seizures. There are a variety of causes that elicit a seizure. Had them as a child, had my shunt routinely checked and it was always fine. Epilepsy and seizures are common with hydro and it does not always mean that the shunt is malfunctioning. I was born with hydrocephalus and I also have epilepsy. However, I am lucky that 100mg of tegrotol xr (Carbamezapine) controls my seizures. I have been seizure free for 20 years. I have recently had shunt problems but no seizures. I had seizures for years due to intracranial hypertension. My VP shunt clogged but everything looked fine on the MRIs. Just recently got a shunt revision and the seizures are pretty much gone. How did they figure out it was clogged if the scans were clean? \n\nI am having some major issues, no seizures,  but abdomen is bulging out at the incision site on my stomach. Very painful. Shunt literally hurts on the other end in my head, like a headache. Run a low fever. But....my symptoms come and go. It is intermittent, no triggers that I can find. And they have done CTs and xray shunt series, and of course everything looks fine. It was worse than uys ever been this past week, but now it is subsiding.  I will be going to the ER next time this happens to this extent. Anyway,  just figured I would ask even though our situations are very different :) I had headaches and seizures only after upright for 2 or more hours. That combined with double vision, confusion, and other symptoms of shunt failure made me get an intracranial pressure monitor. The scans looked fine but my intracranial pressure was dangerously high.\nIf nothing comes up in your scans and you suspect some kind of shunt failure I highly recommend a shunt tap or ICP monitor. It probably saved my life I only had that happen when my shunt malfunctioned...I am sorry you have to go through that... How did they know it malfunctioned? All my tests came back fine and it is still on the same setting it was before hand (programmable valve). I appreciate the empathy. Weird stuff for sure. Weirdest thing I have ever experienced 1. My mom noticed that my head looked fuller\n\n2. One day I decided to take a nap and when my mom came in to wake me up for dinner I was unresponsive and laying face down and when she finally got me to wake up I just seemed really out of it.\n\n3. I kept falling down and was just acting weird\n\nSo my mom took me to the hospital where they ran a bunch of tests on me and that is how they found out that my catheter was not in the place it should have been and it was a pretty old shunt...it lasted me almost 18 years before giving out... I see. Thanks for the info. I do not have any issues besides just the one seizure on 9/2. Other than that I have been fine since November of 2020 when the shunt was placed. You are welcome", "Can strong emotion cause an increase in ICP? I cannot cry, get angry, experience stress, or even be joyful and laugh a lot without getting pressure like headaches. For context I am still finding the right setting for my vp shunt I got in late january 2021, and am even going to travel to get it adjusted again tomorrow. So I assume with the right setting, this would not be an issue anymore? Even if I only get teary eyed, or cry for like 3 seconds, I have a pressure headache for the rest of the day. I have had to train myself to stop it before it starts, which has negatively impacted how I express emotion. \n\nI will be asking my neurosurgeons NP, who I see for shunt adjustments, this no matter what kind of responses I get here. \n\nOn another note does anyone else get mild visual hallucinations when experiencing pressure issues? They all but disappeared the few weeks after surgery where my body reacted well to that pressure setting. *whom* I see There are a lot of different sinuses in your cranium that could be causing your issue. I would continue to ask your neurosurgeon, but I would also speak with your gp who may recommend an ent. Intracranial pressure from csf is not something that should change with short term emotional response to situations. Thank you for the suggestion- I had not even thought about my sinuses during all this. I will have to find a gp first but my neuro nurse may be able to give me a referral for ent. Thanks again &gt;On another note does anyone else get mild visual hallucinations when experiencing pressure issues?\n\nYes it looks like flashing lights out the corner of my eye.  Makes it hard to sleep too. I have Me too! I had been talking to my PCP recently about it and he referred me to a new neurosurgeon and an Ophthalmologist. Both said nothing of issue. So, Do you know what is actually going when this happens? Is it really just a hallucination? I had wicked bad headaches too and it turned out my shunt had failed.  I think it has to do with pressure on the optic nerve.", "Hydrocephalus Awareness like never before! ", "did you receive your serial number of the shunt after surgery? did you receive a serial number with your shunt after surgery? update : the shunt has no serial no, only a reference no. thanks everyone The only info I got after surgery was the brqnd, and that is because I got a copy of the surgery report. And as far as seeing that same surgeon, I cannot, because my insurance does not work with his office. So, I am seeing one of their doctors. My surgery (2nd revision) was done on an emergency basis. +1 I had my lp shunt placed back in 2013 and when I was discharged I received my card with the serial number inside. It was a label place inside of the card. Fast forward to 2018 I had to have a stent placed in vein in my head. I was supposed to receive a card with the serial number but never have. Even after numerous calls to the surgeon\u2019s. Luckily I keep my discharge papers from that surgery and the imaging done before I was discharged and is stated the stent that was placed. I am now in the process of try to get my shunt revised (it is malfunctioning). Keep at it and if the office still does not give you the serial of the shunt you might have to take this up higher and go to patient affairs. Another thing that worked for me when I forgot my card for a P.E.T scan the radiology department called the surgeons office and got the serial of the shunt. I hope this helps \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd\n\nAlso if it is ok, do you mind explaining your shoulder pain you are experiencing. I am going crazy with these constant headaches and shoulder pain but the doctors are just brushing it off as if it coming from one of my other medical problems. No, and I do not know the brand of mine, either.\n\nAnd the NS who did the surgery retired. I have had six revisions, but only on the part of the shunt above the shoulder (so abdominal part has been untouched for 29 years)\n\nI swear it is all calcified, probs broken. My surgeon said that if I do not have a headache, he is not opening me up again. HOWEVER, I do sometimes get various degrees of abdominal pain (not as bad as my headaches at all). Surgeon said it is my shunt legit poking my diaphragm which is very sensitive. And that pain radiates to your shoulders. \n\nDo you think that could be relatable to what you are experiencing? thank you! my office finally responded and said my implant has no serial number, it only has a reference number. The pain does start in my abdomen were my shunt empties. When I get the abdomen pain it is like an aura and the shoulder pain starts and intensify and gets very painful. Like to point where it hurts in my shoulder to breathe. Tried explaining this to a doctor but I was dismissed. Thank you for explaining thanks for your reply, i heard back from the office finally and they said there is no serial number for mine, only a reference number. now i am waiting on release forms. \nwe sound like we have some similar issues regarding the shunt, they believe mine is malfunctioning too. the shoulder pain is on my left shoulder (i have a left placement shunt) placed in 2019 around this time last year. when i woke up, i felt like i was breathing in shards of glass and the tip of my shoulder hurt so so bad. every breath i took was a sharp stinging pain, and my left rib (under the breast area) felt like when you go running and get that side cramp. then my lower right abdomen has terrible pain, that feels like stretching and turning of my insides. i cannot even stand up straight when the pain intensifies. i end up squirming around, trying to twist and turn to hopefully relieve whatever is happening and whimpering about it. lol. the pain is always there, and varies by intensity. when it is at a lower intensity, i am anxious because i know it will worsen at any given moment. i have had a CT/MRI and they think my tubing is too long. my neurosurgeon said he would shorten it, but needed to rule out any other issues and referred me to an ENT, OBGYN and Endocrinologist. i have seen the ENT and OBGYN and cleared on both of those ends, but i have not been able to see the Endo with COVID going on. since surgery. also since post op, i have had breakouts along the shunt tract of small spots that look like acne. they come and go, and some get worse in my neck area that look like cystic pimples. i also have had swelling on my collarbone, that also goes up and down.  gurgling noises in my stomach area. i am waiting to get the release forms signed so i can get my MRI ran, as the doctors cannot do anything without images. i hope this is helpful information, and hopefully you find some answers/relief soon too.\n\nedit: do you experience chest cracking? since my surgery the middle of my chest cracks every time i stretch. audibly, other people in the room can hear it too. it used to hurt so bad when it first happened, i felt like i could not put my arms back together lol. and sometimes it still does that but not as frequently since it began. I thank you so much. I finally feel like I am not crazy. My shunt is on the right side and what you described is exactly what has been happening. I found out my shunt was malfunctioning back in 2018 but have not been able to get a doctor to take me serious. The doctor that placed the shunt back in 2013 does not take insurance and I do not have $9k for the revision surgery let alone a $500 doctors visit. I hope for best for you as well and that you get well so \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd you are definitely not crazy, keep hanging in there. i am doing the same, we are in the same boat! we will get this figured out - keep your head up. thanks again! Thank you for the encouragement. Please if you can keep us updated! I have had so many revisions, you could tell me my VA shunt is made from an expired Twizzler/Red Vine and the valve is from your sink and id believe it. ***and too be honest,  I never even thought about my shunt having a serial number, but of course it would.*** That is just like me. I am a female so when I wear a bra, some time the abdomen/lower chest pain is so uncomfortable I need to take my bra off. Like I cannot have anything restricted over my stomach/chest area until the pain settles down. The doc also says the tube moves a lot from walking/moving while sleeping, so that is why my pain may fluctuate on certain days. \n\nKeep pushing the doc (or docs tho) especially if you keep feeling pain. You know your body best! I am sorry you are having these problems. My son, who has hydrocephalus, spent a few miserable years having problems no seemed to be able to solve.\n\nI hope you find relief.", "Rant: Feeling very done with shunt revisions! I have had a VP shunt since I was about 3 and I am not 26. I have slit ventricle syndrome as well so my shunts do not last very long and I have never made it more than a year before needing a shunt revision. It really did not bother me at all up until a couple of years ago. It is such a disruption to my life now and I miss my dog so much when I am in hospital. I am just very over this =( Anyone have any sage advice at all about getting over this? No advice, unfortunately. But just know someone out there read this and is thinking of you. I have been having a bad time with my hydro recently as well, and I absolutely feel your pain. Hang in there. Do things that are relaxing to you. Massage, acupuncture, hobbies, etc. Get your mind off things.  I am not familiar with SVS - why do the shunts not last? Is it due to blockage or breakage, or just the shape of the ventricles? Or are modern shunts not that good? (I have got a 26 year old time bomb in me now). My ventricles are collapsed and rigid. So the space that the shunt is in is tiny and does not expand as the pressure increases. They just block more often. The explanation for why seems to be a bit hand wavy though. I have only have one catheter actually snap and that was the peritoneal one, not the ventricular one. I have had a few shunt infections but 9.5/10 it is just a blockage.\n\nAs for the state of modern shunts, I can think of a lot of advancements that would help but they are in the research stages. I do not have a programmable one because I had one for a year and had a ridiculous amount of revisions and then went back to a static. That was 20 years ago though so maybe they are better now. The research into biofilms is promising, there is possibilities for stopping infections and blockages but it will be a while before implementation. There is also research into nanoscale structures on surfaces to stop infection which is surprisingly easy and works well but it will take a while to get to shunts. The good news is that this research is already being implemented in cochlear implants (biofilms) and dental implants (nanostructures) so we have come a long way.\n\nA for the time bomb thing, do not be too scared, I am making it out to be worse than it is here. The actual surgery is fine and there is next to no recovery. I wake up in post up and my hearing and sight are immediately back and it is amazing. I am out of hospital within 48 hours of surgery. Its just the week in hospital waiting for surgery that I hate but I am a really impatient person who gets bored easily haha. At the moment my vision has deteriorated a lot and I have to be asleep 16 hours a day so I am just managing to get my work done in a day haha. Very ready for the surgery to be over. I just wish I could go to hospital and have the surgery the next day and have it all be over in a few days.\n\nI hope your issues look up soon!  Make sure you push your surgeons into acting. I get so annoyed with the standoffish way they run things. When they say \"we are not sure it is the shunt so we would like to wait\" I ask what else it could be then and can we treat that because we both know there is something wrong. Sometimes that works because they think for half a second and realise that there is nothing else (in my case) that it could be. Well that sucks having so many surgeries. Ok - so it is a physical space problem. Is there any research into ways to 'expand' the  ventricles (kind of like a stent)? Perhaps we need Roald Dahl back on the case :) The problem is that the ventricles normally collapse when you are very young so during development. If my ventricles expanded now, they would push on my brain. They actually expanded a tiny amount once when I was 23. I had the worst recovery ever and had to learn to walk again. That time though I had broken the shunt with blunt force trauma by hitting my head on a metal bar. It was not until after surgery when the ventricles went back down that I had issues though. My wife has hydrocephalus, but has had slit ventricles for the last several months. She had to have one surgery recently because of a blockage, She has a programmable shunt, but the doctors are nervous about adjusting it because she has a history of parkinsonism now due to several inflate/collapse cycles. Her vision has not corrected, so you are at least fortunate that it corrects.\n\nHer symptoms only relieved for 2 days, now she is going on a 3 weeks and she is back to vertigo and puking everyday. Docs want to do an ETV, but they have to expand her ventricles first.\n Programmable shunts did that kind of thing to me too but I think for some people there is less surgeries so there is upsides. An ETV is a great course if they are able to do it. Super important that it is done \"soon\" so that the ventricles do not become rigid first. That might not happen to her but it does happen sometimes over time. Currently in John's Hopkins trying to fill her ventricles to do the etv. So very frustrating.  That is frustrating. At least you are at a very good hospital and know she is in good hands. I have just had my second overseas surgery in the last week and they have given me a programmable shunt so this will be interesting haha. I have SVS as well. I am only up to 19 surgeries, but I definitely feel for you. Here is a couple possible options to help keep your spirits up while in the hospital:\n\n* See if you can get your dog certified as a ( Then your parents or friends might be able to bring him/her into the hospital to visit you. \n\nIf that is not an option,\n\n* See if your doctors/nurses will allow you to sit outside the hospital, but still on premises for a little bit when you are well enough to walk around on your own. Maybe even clamp off your IV for an hour. Since it is not inside, dogs are usually welcome on leashes. \n\nI had my dog visit me a time or two durong long hospital stays using the second method.  \n\nGood luck to you. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me.  I probably would not bring my dog in just because she is a greyhound and 10 y/o so she is not a fan of being awake for more than an hour haha.\n\nWhen I have surgery at home, I have pretty much constant visitors so I have one to two meals a day in one of the hospital cafes so I manage to get up and about a bit. I am not good at still.\n\nI am a PhD student which means I get alot of work done in hospital which is nice. I wrote my honours thesis in hospital which was actually quite good. I had surgery in Germany three times in the three months I was there, recently. That was the worst because I was there for 3 weeks with two visitors the whole time and I could not communicate with anyone very well. I just got really bored. They let you just wander away whenever but I was a super small building on a massive campus so I could not go very far. I do not recommend having surgery in a foreign country but if you have to, their technology is fine and it turns out you only need minimal communication haha. I think I would be too afraid to have surgery in most countries. But Germany is not one that I would be afraid of. I did have to be medivacced out of Mexico though because of a shunt malfunction. It came on fast and was severe (only two months after one of my surgeries).\n\nGlad to hear your doing well! What subject are you getting your PhD in? I have been thinking of getting a MS in my field (my work will pay for most of it) but I feel like I just do not have the time to devote to it. ", "Damaged nerves after revision? Has anyone had a nerve damaged, cut or aggravated after a revision? I had a tubing revision in July. I have been having shooting and stabbing pains in the front and back of my head. My head is still numb and my shunt and valve (shunt is my original from 1987) are very sore and sensitive to touch. \n\nI have had 4 shunt series since my surgery and every one has come back fine. The shunt is working so my surgeon told me to see a neurologist for the pain.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Sorry that you have to go through that. Sending you hugs.\n\nI have been dealing with something similar for 20 years. I had a revision in 2001 where they took out the original shunt from the right-hand side and put a new one on the left-hand side. Ever since then, I have had daily pain where my shunt enters my head when laying down, touching my head/combing my hair or even without aggravating it. Sometimes the pain is so bad it feels like a whole headache. The last neurosurgeon I spoke to said it was nerve damage but the shunt itself is working fine. Unfortunately, I have not found any medication that works to numb the pain I have damaged optical nerves after my most recent surgery. The doctors informed me that I have lost 40% of my vision and it will never come back. It sucks but at least I am not legally blind (yet) I get the shot ring stabbing pain and just completed a Venogram MRI . I will get results today Thank you for your reply! Good luck on your mri results! Oh no! That sounds very similar to what I am experiencing. It hurts to brush my hair, lay down, tilt my head back etc. The doctor gave me neurotin so I am hoping it will help. \n\nI hope you get some relief soon! I know it is miserable to be in pain. \ud83d\ude22 Here is to hoping the medication works for you and the pain subsides \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe And thank you! I really hope so too", "Another hospital admission. My 3.5 year old son has been admitted to hospital because his shunt was extremely swollen and sticking out and he was really lethargic and just not himself. This now means we will be here for Christmas and most likely more surgery. Was really hoping for some normality/routine to start happening. But nope back to hospital schedules and ringing Every support service possible trying to get myself some assistance because hospital do not provide meals for parents but I am not allowed to leave him to go home and get food because he is only 3.5. Oh and no one can bring me anything because no visitors allowed due to covid. Really done with this year. Sending love to the rest of the group members xx I am praying for you and your son. I have had many a blessing and hope this trend continues on to you. Perhaps you will get a Christmas miracle? Thank you, it really means alot to me. I really do hope we get a Christmas miracle. He is such a happy bubbly loving and caring boy so I struggle seeing him be in pain and seeing fear in his eyes. I just want to take it all away from him. Dang.. I am sorry to hear this. Praying for you and your little warrior. Thank you xx  Been there! It is super tough. We had a similar rough spot at 3 years of age.  Hospital did not provide beds for the parent. I \"slept\" on two chairs and straight to work for about 4 weeks. No family where we live. Wife just had a 2nd baby at the time. I feel your pain. But it will eventually get better. Yeah the \"bed\" they have here for parents is a foam chair thing but yeah you wake up so stiff and sore. Glad things got better for you. I know things will get there. I am just tired and emotional. My hip is so out of whack from my daughter\u2019s last emergency shunt surgeries in august! I feel your pain. We were also in the hospital the week before Christmas a couple of years ago and got out Christmas Eve. Usually recovery after surgery is pretty quick. I hope you are out by Christmas. Also Childrens\u2019 hospitals are usually good about the holidays - when we were there my daughter got lots of free presents! Hang in there! I have slept on all of the combination chair / sofa / beds. I always refer to them as the worst transformers ever. It is extremely emotionally draining. What state are you in? So sorry to hear of this, wishing you all the best. Ouch!! Hope your hip starts to feel better soon. I am hoping we get out before Christmas too. Fingers crossed. I am in Queensland Australia. And your exactly right about them being the worst transformers ever haha. After this year I am already so drained and this has just sent me so close to breaking point. But we will get there. Thank you xx I just joined this group and read your post. Wanted to say I hope everything is okay. This year really has been rough for so many of us. I know we always care for our loved ones but do not forget to take care of yourself too!! Sending you a hug. \ud83e\udd17 Thank you. Xx I am doing my best to remember to take care of myself. Thankfully my son is doing okay but still an extremely hard time at the moment. Our hospital has really strict restrictions at the moment so no visitors, only one parent or guardian is allowed in wth the child, no interaction with other patients/parents so it is very isolating for both my son and I. They usually have meerkats that the children can go see and a huge fish tank but they closed them both off and same with the family hub room and the kids starlight room. Cannot wait to get home with my little boy to get back to some sort of normality and routine again.", "Struggling with my recovery Hi, I will try and make this as short as possible. I am 36m and I was born with hydrocephalus. I had a VP shunt placed at birth. I was lucky that I had great doctors and they caught it early. The only problem I had was when I was 13 I had to have my shunt tubing replaced.\n\nUntil last year when I was 35. My shunt finally failed and I ended up having 3 brain surgeries and my one VP shunt was replaced by 2 programmable ones.\n\nMy wife was pregnant when I was going through my surgeries. I ended up having to stay 3 months in the hospital. I lost a ton of weight, I was unable to eat, drink, walk or talk correctly. I also ended up with a lazy eye due to the pressure on my brain.\n\nMy daughter was born in December 2020 and at first I could not do anything. My wife had to care for me and my daughter.\n\nAfter 6 months of daily speech and physical therapy I am now (almost) back to normal. I can do everything that I could pre surgery (my eye is still cross eyed so I cannot drive) but now I can take care of myself, eat, drink etc. I can also help out with my daughter.\n\nBut I am not 100%. I tire easily and I am still underweight. I suffer from headaches and stomach issues.\n\nNow that it is been a year my wife says she is tired of caring for me and the baby. My wife has done a lot for me but she magically expects me to be exactly the same as I was before and I am not. I am trying to help with childcare etc but she just feels like I am a burden. It is frustrating. I am sorry to hear about your problems. What i do not understand is, you write that meanwhile you can take care of yourself and even help out with your daugther - why does your wife now (as things seem to get better) think like she does?\n\nAnd if i may ask: Why did all this happen? Did you get an infection or a bleeding during the shunt replacement? Reading about experiences with hydrocephlaus like yours always scares me to death and reminds me what a frustrating thing hydrocephalus is.\n\nI hope things will get better for you.\n\nKind regards I was unlucky in the aspect that I had to have 3 brain surgeries back to back and now have 2 programmable shunts (instead of one non programmable like before)\n\nHowever, I was very lucky to have my surgeries here in Spain (so I did not have to pay a ton of money like back in the US) and even though my recovery has been very hard I have not had any infections or problems with the shunts themselves.\n\nWhen you live with hydrocephalus you live with the reality that your shunt can break at anytime and your recovery may be super easy and simple or difficult like mine.\n\nBut you just got to live your life the best way you can. I think my wife is just tired. I am also tired. Sorry to hear you had to go thru this. Props to you for staying so strong and sounds like you have the right mindset to get thru this. Good luck to you. Babies are exhausting. They do not really care about your sleep needs or schedule desires. My daughter has hydrocephalus and I remember the first year she was home being absolutely exhausting. I would recommend some couples therapy to make sure you all are communicating well and try to work out a solution. My heart goes out to you. Praying that you recover fully, soon Thank you very much for your kind words Some shunt revisions suck. I have had about 200 revisions over 28 years and I have only had a handful knock me down like this, where I needed physical therapy to walk again and care for myself. Sometimes it just happens and I know that does not make you feel better, it made me rage at the walls. Do you have an OT? What about neurophysio? In addition be kind to yourself and your family. \n\nUnderstand that maybe you can only do what you have to do while you continue to get better, not what you want to do. This might mean no going over to visit family with the baby, they can visit you. No going out with friends, they can bring take out to you as long as they do not make a mess and help with the baby. No taking on extra projects right now, just get done what you need to.\n\nGood luck, you can and will get better and your child will be proud of you. Thank you. I am trying to get make sure I understand my new (hopefully temporary) limitations and that my wife does also. We are all trying... It is hard throwing a 7 month old daughter into the mix lol. My wife likes to compare me now to the me pre surgeries but I think that person is gone and I wish she would not compare me, although in her defense, I can hardly expect her to understand what I am going through just as I do not understand labor and delivery. I wish she would try though Honestly I did not get it either the first time. I am going through a new treatment at the moment and the second the doctor laid it out for me and I thought about working and everything I knew that the next three months would just be making sure I kept my job and that our pets were not neglected (we do not have kids). Friends could wait, family could wait, the house can get messy, we can have take out every night. This is how it will have to be, these are the only two priorities I have at the moment. Ya I am just trying to juggle my recovery, working, my wife working and taking care of our daughter. It is been a lot. This pandemic on top of everything else has not helped our stress levels. I hope my relationship smooths out in the future, I really do not want to divorce on top of everything else", "Anyone get headaches around shunt surgery site after Pfizer vaccine? \nMy head really hurts in that areas alone,  it is day 6 after the vaccine. I received the Moderna vaccine (both doses) and did not experience this side effect, FWIW. Hope you are doing ok, regardless! Okay thanks. I definitely have a really bad headache, and I am that area and never get them so feel like it is related.  Of course how would I know that.  Did you have a VP shunt? Yeah I have a VP shunt. If the tenderness continues to be an issue (like 24 hours from now or so), I would probably visit an ER just to be on the safe side. Might have an issue that popped up that was independent of the vaccine. So I do not Have a VP shunt , but instead they I planted a intrventriculat catheter - but the same material.  Not much an ER can do for me .  I was wondering if maybe antibodies are attacking the silicon or something causing the pain. I had this! Around my vp shunt I had pfizer Mine went away by now- you?", "Confusion about symptoms of over or under-drainage, getting shunt adjusted in 4 days but I am worried about miscommunications and misinfo. I am about 2 months post op for my first VP shunt for acquired hydro due to a pineocytoma. I felt better after my surgery but now I feel like I did beforehand. I called and my neurosurgeons nurse wants me to come in in 4 days for an adjustment, it will be the first time. She says it is over-drainage. \n\nMy symptoms have been: \n\u2022 Headache after waking up, in the afternoons and evening it is more severe, I have to have caffeine throughout the day in order to feel any relief at all. OTC pain meds do jack s%#t\n\u2022 Irritability, tiredness/ hardcore fatigue. No covid-19 or other acute illness\n\u2022 Worsening coordination&amp; balance\n\u2022 Difficulty waking up or staying awake\n\u2022 Tinnitus, esp at night and paired with dizzy episodes\n\u2022 Some pain behind eyes and base of skull where it meets my neck\n\u2022 Increased urination, like every 10 minutes, just like pre-op. Post op this improved.\n\nMy symptoms faded away after my surgery but as my headaches continue my other symptoms get worse &amp; happen more frequently. My confusion comes in where my neurosurgeons nurse says the only thing that indicates shunt issues needing adjustment are the headaches. She said the fatigue, lightheaded/dizzy episodes, sleepiness etc are not a symptom of shunt issues. But everywhere else I have heard they are classic signs of shunt issues? I want to trust her medical knowledge but I also want to trust the experiences people with hydro themselves have gone through. I do not really know what the truth is about this. How am I supposed to look out for shunt issues in the future if I am being told two conflicting things? This condition is complicated enough and the uncertainty is highly stressful for me. I feel like I am not educated enough about this condition and despite being treated really well by doctors for once, and building trust with my neurosurgery team, I feel like they are not being as thorough as they should about a condition so serious... I just had a VP shunt about nine months ago and I also have been trying to navigate the new process of having a shunt. I was over Shunted and one of the main symptoms I was having was when I walked it felt like my brain was rattling around in my head. Probably the best way to tell is get a CT scan or MRI. I am new to this so if anybody else has advice that is in the medical field I would listen to them. I try to get as many opinions as I can. I also have sleep apnea,  that I suspect contributed to my hydrocephalus. Your symptoms feel more than just over-draining. The nurse is probably just going by the book. Over/under draining can have various effects. Everyone will have drainage issues. There is no perfect level for all. CT scan should be able show a difference in vent size. \n\nHowever, blockages are not always so easily detected. Thanks. It is hard navigating this condition, I appreciate your response. \nIt feels more like pressure than space in my head, like my brain is trying to push out of my skull. I will call in the morning and ask if we can do imaging beforehand. Do you mean that over or under-drainage can cause secondary conditions? \nI will call in the morning and ask if we can do imaging beforehand, I do not want to have it adjusted and it be the wrong setting. \n\nIs it unrealistic to expect any setting to relieve my headaches completely (barring any other headache/ migraine disorder), as well as the other neurological issues I mentioned? A neurologist is also someone good to talk to. They can order imaging. I have also been experiencing double vision so my neurologist had me see a ophthalmologist who ordered a CT scan That is not unrealistic. You should not be having headaches regularly. Yes, drainage can cause secondary conditions.", "Has anyone experienced night sweats following a revision? I had a revision done about 12 days ago, but I have been having some minor night sweats since I came out of surgery. I was worried this was an infection since it can be a symptom but they did a bunch of tests and ruled out infection, I also have no fever or anything. Everything is healing well and I feel good besides a small head pain from the surgery, but has anyone else experienced night sweats? Not right after. But definitely had them before. Could be anxiety. Especially since you just had the revision and are probably still a bit worried. That is a common cause. You saw a doc and ruled out infection, that is the important thing. I had mine done 12 days ago too and I do not have that. My incisions are uncomfortable but I saw my surgeon and he took out my stitches. One of the 11 incisions got infected but I am on antibiotics for it", "Post Accident I was born 3 months premature and developed Hydrocephalus after a series of problems, which was treated by a VP shunt. Had about 8 revisions since. I am now 31(f) with migraines, but overall normal life.\n\nLast week, I got in a car accident. A Jeep rear ended my Honda Civic. At the time, I did not even think about me because I thought I was fine. I was worried about the guy in the Jeep. He seemed fine. We exchanged numbers...the whole bit.\n\nFast forward to a few hours later. Sore neck and shoulders with a minor headache. None have felt like \"run to the ER\" kind. Worried, I scheduled for a CT scan at Kaiser on the day of the accident. It is not until Tuesday. I have had headaches off/on since. My anxiety is saying it is my shunt and to hurry to the ER, but with little else changing I have reasoned with myself that I can wait until Tuesday to see.\n\nI am just curious if it sounds concerning or is it \"just whiplash\". Honestly, I would not be surprised if my current shunt was impacted in the accident. It is about 10 years old now. It is not worth chancing it. I would go to the ER anyway, last thing you want is something escalating. Go to the hospital and get a lawyer. Beyond just getting yourself checked out, a documented hospital visit is critical for getting you fairly compensated after the accident. Insurance companies will give you next to nothing if you are not represented. It is also a huge time saver to have a professional handle all the paper work and phone calls. Get it checked ASAP. You are probably ok but get it checked asap.  For me, a quick visit to the ophthalmologist verifies if I have pressure build up behind my eye = get to the hospital.   I use the eye doctor as Step 1 I overthink a lot about my shunt too but after an accident like that go asap!", "Those of you who have had shunt tubes break, did you feel when it happened?  I had a shunt break in my chest when I was a freshman in high school, in the spring of 1999. I never actually felt the shunt disconnect when it happened. I just had stomach flu symptoms for a few days, then they went away.  After they went away, the symptoms returned a few days later. It was after the second time having the symptoms that I got checked out.  The doctor did a shunt tap, where he inserted a needle \ud83d\udc89 into the shunt and took some CSF out.  I felt better right away.  They did another test, where the shunt was injected with a dye that they could trace with an X-ray machine, and from there, the doctor was able to figure out exactly where the shunt had broken in my chest.  They repaired the distal catheter and extended it I never felt the actual tube break but I certainly felt the after affects like increased pressure, headaches, vomiting etc. I knew that I needed to go in for a revision ", "Shunt valve replacememt Ok, so I saw a new neurosurgeon due to a military move I couldnt go to my original surgeon. So my valve is no longer staying programmed. He is going to replace the valve but not the brain catheter. He also maybe replacing the catheter in my stomach. I forgot to ask if I will have two cranial incisions like my original surgery or what?", "Sounds Hi everyone. So this month has been a bad month for me. I have been struggling with my hydrocephalus and it seems like it is getting worse. There is days where I am okay and there is days (twice this week) where i have to throw up so bad I cant eat and I have a headache so bad that I feel disoriented and I am on the floor trying not to pass out or throw up. I have a ct scan schedule for this Thursday and was told if it got too bad to go to the emergency room. It has not gotten there yet but today I heard my shunt (which is annoying but something that has happened and is how I caught my last malfunction) but today it sounded like pop rocks or like something was fizzling and my ears did this weird tunnel thing that only happens when my shunt wants me to hear it. Does anyone else have this problem? What did/would you do? It depends on if your hydrocephalus will show in a scan or not. For me, the changing of the ventricles is not as apparent as the symptoms, but if your symptoms are worse then they usually are during a failure, you might want to go to the ER. I know, for me the sound means that it is definitely failing, so going in early might be the safest bet. Well for me I get very very sick and the first time I heard a noise is how I caught my last malfunction. Maybe I am having another one? Hopefully not but we will see", "Core/abdominal exercise and shunt tubing/scar tissue Hi folks\n\nI have been doing pilates for a few months, and I have come up against some issues. I had my last surgery in 2019 with a new abdominal scar as well as the one on my head. I have a total of three abdominal scars from shunt surgeries. I am noticing that during my exercise routine, the scars will hurt before my muscles fatigue, and it is kind of getting in the way of me giving my best effort. I have also noticed that some of the positions where you are required to bend or twist, there is resistance. I know the shunt tubing is flexible but it feels like it is getting in the way. \n\nHas anyone else had these issues with core exercises? Have you found a workaround?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I have been given the all-clear by the surgeon to 'do whatever'. Besides, NHS + pandemic = good luck getting in touch with your doctor.)", "I think my Mom has it. Looking for advice ", "Using earphones w/ a programmable shunt? I have a codman programmable shunt and have not used earphones since I had my valve changed to a programmable. I am worried that they will mess with my settings. Is it safe to use earphones (specifically happyplugs and apple earphones) with a programmable shunt? I hope this is not a really stupid question! It should not be a problem. Ear phones have very small THEM fields associated with their function, and besides that, the frequency at which the shunt is adjusted was likely designed such that external fields do not unintentionally change the setting. So unless your neurosurgeon/neurologist told you otherwise it should be no big deal.  Awesome, thanks!", "Are people with hydrocephalus at a higher risk of developing schizophrenia? I study psychology and we were learning about schizophrenia and the neurological differences and it was found that those with schizophrenia often have enlarged ventricles. I have also studied psychology. Correlation does not lead to causation, so I would say no, we are not at a higher risk.", "Looking for advice on symptoms i have had for a while. Hello!\n\nTL;DR - Got fixed shunt replaced with variable shunt, now when it rains I cannot think, work, or remember things. \n\nI am definitely a fun and long case, but long story as short as I can short I was shunted right before college around 2007. Originally I had a fixed VP shunt, and that was fine. I had some revisions because I had terrible referred pain in my shoulder, and my surgeon thought it was the tubing causing issues. \n\nFast forward to 2016 and I am in the hospital with a serious brain infection, which it turns out was the cause of the shoulder pain. The neurosurgeon I who operated on me had put in a Variable shunt, which leads me to my current situation. \n\nFor the past two years i have had terrible symptoms whenever it rains or the barometric pressure changes. I get headaches, nausea, have that \"hat\" feeling around the top of my head, I feel pressure/almost water weight in my abdoment and sometimes have pain near where my catheter is.  \n\nThe real scary symptoms however are the mental ones. I lose my memory, I cannot think straight, cannot focus, and basically cannot work. My friends have also commented that my personality changes and I become very short tempered and sometimes irritable, which I know is because i am trying to find words or do things and cannot. \n\nI have been working with my neurologist the past 2 years to try and find a cure for the symptoms. I have tried nerve blockers, various medicine like Propranolol and Amovig. Nothing has seemed to realy help at all. \n\nI am convinced the issue is the change from a fixed shunt to a variable shunt, especially since all of these symtpoms started after I fully healed after my surgery/infection. I also do not know if the symptoms related to rain/pressure happened immediately, because it took me a while (with help from friends) to realize the correlation between my episodes of mental dullness and the rain. \n\nI am seeing another doctor now for a second opinion, but I wanted to ask if anyone has had similar situations or symptoms, and if I sound crazy. When it gets so bad I cannot go to work i am very concerned, and my neurosurgeon basically said \"pressure's fine, go talk to your neurologist\". \n\nAny advice would be helpful!", "Is pain on the opposite side of the shunt area in my head normal after surgery? I just had a revision done on the 10th of November and have been at home recovering ever since. Since yesterday, I have had off and on pain on the opposite side of where the new shunt is and it seems to come on with laughter or anything that makes me tense my head up. \n\nI have not yet called my doctor but wanted to see if this was normal for anyone else more informative? When you tense up, or do anything that makes you tense up, like that feeling in your head when you poop, that increases your intercranial pressure. \n\nLast year, I had an ETV and they removed as much of an old shunt as they could, but did not put in a new shunt. I still have pain around what they had to leave. I dunno if that helps or not. I hope it does. Do you not have a shunt anymore? Not a full functioning one, no. When did you get your shunt? When did they decide you could cease needing a shunt? Sorry if I am prodding.  It is okay. I got it when I was 9 days old. Last year, late October/early November, I had the surgery for the ETV and we agreed I did not want a new shunt. So they hooked me up to a pressure monitor for the week and my pressures were fine so I was okay. I took a risk, and there was a chance I would have needed to go back into surgery, but then I was okay.", "My BP is high I had a spinal tap and after taking 30ml I felt so much better!\n\nWhile im wiating for my follow up with the neuro...my BP has gone back up..it qas normal gain immediate after the spinal tap....and lasted about a week...\n\nIm back ro 200/106... horrible head pain...side pain...I feel weak..\n\nIve taken BP medications clonodine...to lover bp..but it keeps climbing...like just going for a shower I start at 164/94 and then im 204/108..!!!\n\nDo I go into the er? Its sunday..Mums day...n I am utterly lost....\n\nAny words is this just my new normal?\n\nId love ro have a shunt or burr hole to take the pressure off...please excuse typos...im.loosing my eyesight this year..from the increased pressure....I cant see very qell to fix all the errors.  Thank you for understanding!\n\nJ In no way is this supposed to be taken as medical advice in any way. I am also not a doctor nor do I know your medical history. Having a high blood pressure will cause you to have headaches. Your blood pressure readings are high and based on my limited research, your bp reading along with your symptoms are considered a hypertension emergency. I would go to the emergency room just for the peace of mind. I am an EMT, your BP is dangerously high. Definitely go to the ER as soon as possible.", "Ringing It is been almost 2 weeks now that I have had my shunt in and I have noticed a ringing, mostly in my left ear, when it is quiet.  I do not know if it is been there and I am just noticing it or it just started, does this sound familiar? *no pun intended*\n\n\nI have been experiencing an intense ringing for awhile, accompanied by vision loss and dizziness. I think it is related to a slightly higher intracranial pressure than I need. \n\nProbably just adjusting symptoms since it is only been a few weeks. Just monitor it for now and note if it gets worse or more frequent I am not a neurosurgeon but it is early days for your shunt. I do get a ringing sometimes, and sometimes I can hear the valve working but those are two different sensations. I know that my shunt is placed very closely behind my ear so...it is just one of those things. It might settle down as your shunt 'beds in' for want of a better word. \n\nDo you have any followup appointments planned? Do you experience any other symptoms with the ringing? Yes I have a follow up planned in 2 weeks, and I am not sure about the symptoms yet, today is the first time I have noticed it and it seems to come and go in sense of intensity like I am outside right now and it is barely noticeable but when I was in my garage earlier and it was quiet, the ringing was louder and more noticeable Will do, ever since my symptoms got worse months ago before surgery I started keeping a journal, it is crazy going back and reading some of that stuff, now I do it daily to keep track Good looks. Yeah it definitely takes the brain some times to adjust to new intracranial pressures, so just be patient, but mindful with it. \n\nHang in there! Best of luck I had this problem about a week and a half after my shunt was placed. Ringing in my ears was one of the symptoms I had prior to my hydrocephalus being diagnosed so I thought my shunt was either blocked or malfunctioning, so I got scared &amp; went to the Emergency Department to get it checked out. Everything was fine thank God, I think my body just needed some time to get adjusted to everything. \n\nI still get noises in my ears sometimes (very rarely) but  my Neurosurgeon said that is just one of the things that come along with shunts. He also told me that I would only need to worry about something if it was a constant thing e.g. constant ringing in the ears or constant high or low pressure headaches. I do not remember any ringing, but I do remember hearing things echo. That did not last long though. Thanks Got it, thanks I have had ringing in my left ear constantly since I have had my shunt (3 years) Oh, that is what that is? Sometimes I have random ringing in my left ear (had this shunt for a good 2+ years now) so I assume we are in the same boat. As far as I am aware, it is perfectly safe.", "Disability? Does anyone around you say you have a disability or your disabled because you cannot do certain things because of your Hydrocephalus and Shunt? I know there are certain activities I should not do because they could damage my shunt but I do not know if that counts as a disability? Thoughts? Yes...my mom tells people I am disabled all the time. I also have a.d.d. tendencies and a mathematical disability. I had an I.E.P. all throughout school and now have an I.S.P. and my mom is working on getting power of attorney so she will be able to make decisions for me. I have also never been able to do any after school activities except for girl scouts for a few years. I would say it is def a disability but only when it is convenient for me lol \n\nI mean the opposite would be an \u2018ability\u2019 and I do not necessarily find it to be a welcomed condition for me personally, therefore, disability That is funny! Only when it is convenient! Never thought of it that way. I personally worry about it affecting my potential for future employment if I ever lost my current job. I perform my current job like anyone else. I worry people I may work for in the future may be skeptical of my abilities. My math skills suffer because I loose the numbers I am trying to calculate unless I see them on paper. I got my shunt as a young adult so I got to do activities as a kid but cannot do those now as an adult which stinks. It is a federal law to discriminate against disabled people so no need to worry there. Worst case, you have a civil suit on your hands that will pay out I struggle to say I do, and I definitely do. \n\nRegarding your employer: document it in writing. You have the right to ask for accommodations, if you are in the US. \n\nYou might be fine now, but should the shunt stop working, you will not be fine. Let them know. In writing. Officially. Now. That really does stink\n\n\nI have had it since I was a baby so I have never been able to do any sports... I document it with my employer for two reasons. 1) in case I ever have a medical emergency or 2) they ever ask me to do something that I cannot do due to my hydrocephalus I wonder if getting frequent migraines counts as a disability.  these migraines cause extreme mental fog to the point I almost cannot function. My vision is bad too because of hydro pressure on my optic nerve but I am not in the legally blind category but I still cannot drive. I would think the migraines would probably be considered a disability because you get to point of not being able to function. I have had headaches like that in the past. I have gotten headaches so bad that I could not think straight every sound hurt and light was awful. Was there anything ( activity wise) that you were able to do? I have tried weightlifting here lately and after my neck ( where my shunt tubing is) hurts really bad like I strained the muscles along the path of the tubing. Your headaches sound like my headaches.  I am at work right now with one of these headaches. What type of work do you do? My employer knows I have a shunt etc. I have never had a seizure, so as long as that never happens I am OK. Sorry..I am on lunch right now. What do you do or take for your headaches? Reading with interest from the UK. My baby has hydrocephalus but so far is developmentally on track. Whether or not she will be classes as disabled seems to depend on the medical professional spoken to. Her neurosurgeon seems to think she is doing great where as her doctor and health visitor seem to have deemed her disabled. Nothing wrong with having a disability  just find it frustrating that the assumption is made when we all know every kid with hydro is impacted differently. Other than the usual exercises, like running, not really\n\n\nEdit: It also does not help that my immune system is not great... Extra strength tylenol but it is not doing jack shit. I work at a hospital. They do not require it, but if I am ever asked I let them know. I do not necessarily think it would ever stop me from doing my job, but sometimes we put patients in barometric chambers in cases such as carbon monoxide poisoning which I would imagine I should not be in? Unsure, definitely varies case by case. Yes everyone is definitely affected different from their Hydo..I have a theory regarding Neurologists and Hydrocephalus/ any other brain condition. When they say your doing great, I think they mean your doing great for someone who still has a liquid balloon in their head. The last Neurologist I saw said he was surprised to see someone like me function without too much difficulty. I have kept a steady job, married, raised two sons. It was anticipated that I would be non responsive and I should just enjoy every day as is. Tylenol does not help when I have a bad headache. I was prescribed Butabital which seems to help. That sounds like excedrin migraine.  My neurosurgeon told me after my last revision to stop taking that stuff.  I am not sure why because these days it is the only thing aside from codeine that helps Did they say why? A long time ago I was prescribed Darvocet. My Neurosurgeon retired and the Dr. that took his place did not want to prescribed me anything and said to take Excedrine Migraine. I tried it and it did not work as well.", "Becoming financially independent Hello everyone.\n\nI am in a tricky situation because I completed my internship mid-July last year but I decided to volunteer at the same place until I find a job. I chose to do this because I do not want to stay at home. \n\nIt is taking up a lot of my time and energy though so I am thinking about leaving because volunteering and job hunting is not something I can manage to do.\n\nSo one major problem is that I could have an anxiety disorder. I am not able to make a decision about what to do next because I am passionate about creative writing and singing but my family does not view such things as a career path I should follow. So I am  trying to think of other options until I am able to move out. Once I move out, I want to pursue my passions. \n\nI also find it hard to talk to parents about what I truly want to do and I also feel scared of the challenges that I am going to face in those particular careers and questioning if they are suitable for me.\n\nSide note: I had posted here a while back about the challenges I have faced living with hydrocephalus. \n\nOther than that, I attended a session with my therapist and we are yet to do further sessions. I am just feeling exhausted and I get anxious often so I was wondering how did any of you go about the process of becoming financially independent and what challenges did you face in the process?", "What is considered normal shunt pain?  How long after it was put in? I just want to rule out any typical post op pain.  \n\nOtherwise I  can feel my shunt tug a bit sometimes, the top portion will get a little soar if I sleep on it the wrong way..but do not think I have felt anything that qualifies as pain. It was put in when I was born in 1994 (25y) I do feel tugging and tightness and pressure as well. Turns out my shunt has been broken for 6 years so this maybe could be calcification discomfort. What are the next steps? None as I am moving countries tomorrow haha! It is bearable so hopefully this goes away on its own. Do this? Pop into any eye doc and ask them to verify there is no pressure building behind your eye, and explain your hydrocephalus.  \n\nThis is a black / white method to know if something is wrong. Thanks for your comment! it could be sinus pressure as well since my allergies are flaring up. Being a hypochondriac sucks. Is it pain at the sight of the shunt or a headache? Headaches are normal, though there is always a risk of a malfunction. Which can present with extremely painful headaches (for me they cause me to have seizures and pass out/vomit). \nPain at the sight is also common after surgery, or if you are over tired (weird right?). But if it is swollen, hot, or red, or feels pointy or misplaced, that is cause for concern. My shunt flipped over when I was in 8th grade. (side note, always inform your hair stylist of your shunt and let them know if something hurts. You are not being a pain, you are taking care of yourself. This girl twisted and pulled my hair so hard my shunt flipped upside down. I have a revision three weeks later.) \nFor me, pain is normal. I always have a baseline headache (generally a 6-7/10). But that is not what it is like for everyone. What is normal for you is not normal for everyone. Making sure you stay in tune with your headaches and pain is paramount. Keeping a pain diary can help, even just jotting down how your head was that day in the notes app on your phone. That can be very helpful for your surgeon and your pain team. You know your body best. If something feels wrong or if you are just thinking \u201cthis is not normal.\u201d Get seen and speak up. Your surgeon is there to listen and so is your pain team, and letting them know your concerns only brings a stronger relationship, which is so helpful for long term treatment. Thanks for your reply! My shunt has not worked for years now. Thankfully I have never had issues with it. I turned my neck a certain way and now I and then I get an ache near the shunt \u00e1rea and my tubing down the neck. I am a severe hypochondriac so this pain/ache does not help. I am going on a flight tomorrow so the anxiety is high. Wait your shunt has not worked for years? But you have never had any issues with it? I am confused. If it is not working that means you should have revision. But when a shunt stops working, if it is not treated the individual generally dies. So it cannot have been malfunctioning for years. Have you ever had a revision? Ive had MRIs done they have always looked normal. My shunt works but my tube is broken. I went last August and it looked good. My doctor wanted to take it out but I did not want to. I just worry about these pains and if they are normal!! My doctor always told me that if I am not profusely vomiting then I am fine..... but I always worry. The tube is broken? As in it is disconnected or it is kinked? If that is the case, again that is hard to believe it is been happening for six years, if you are saying it is \u201cbroken\u201d since that would cause tremendous pain. \nIf the pain is getting worse, it is cause for you to see your surgeon. They went to medical school. They know when something is not right, so if they want to replace the tubing you should get it replaced. I do not see any reason not to, or why you would be confused about the pain if you pretty much have your answer right there. You need your tubing to be replaced, if that is what they actually said was what was wrong.", "Does head shrink if you drain the fluid from head if you have hydrocephalus Just wondering since my head is disproportionate to my face and my head is very\" veiny\"  Its not a good idea to play internet guessing games with vision problems, loss of vision can be serious. If you cannot see, getting it checked by a professional is always the best option. I never said I cannot see I just said my vision gets blurred  The question would be why, and that can only be answered by your physician\n\n\n\n&gt;\"Since some children and adults with hydrocephalus can develop different eye problems and high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure can damage vision, it is important for patients to have periodic checkups for any vision issues.\" Yeah I am booking an appointment with my docter Hope everything goes well. I went blind for six months once (thanks to a reaction to macrodantin) and was afraid I would never see again. Now its the least blur and I am on it. Oh damn. What was the experience like  Terrifying and painful. It came on so suddenly. I was at work, then my vision in my left eye got fuzzy. By the time I had got to the doctor, I could only see light and dark on that side. People who were born with hydrocephalus do tend to have smaller heads after treatment.  Are there any images or links? No. Just data from a neurologist. You need a doctor though because an online diagnosis is pretty worthless. There are a lot of things that can cause cranial pressure. Even if you have developed hydrocephalus it is a different type than people born with it. Your head cannot change sizes as an adult though. The bones are all fused by the time you are one year old. The pressure people with hydrocephalus report is in the ventricals of their brain, which is essentially a cavity in the middle of the brain and since there is no where for it to go pressure builds. A preemie for example will show the swelling.  What If I  just had a large amount of fluid in my brain when i was born  and was not diagnosed properly the fluid did not increase or decrease over the years would it be possible if I removed this fluid that my head would go to it is original size also also can I see the data and can I send you a pic of my head  Damn at least you made a recovery.also want to ask do you have hydrocephalus as well  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).   We are not born with extra fluid in the way you are describing. That is not quite how the body works. Spinal fluid is constantly being circulated. It is not something that just sits in the brain at a set level. People with hydrocephalus essentially do not have the adequate structures to manage spinal fluid and it can build up to unsafe levels. Many people have a shunt put in which regulates the pressure. You need to maintane some pressure and fluid though so it is more complicated than just a drain tube. \n\nI do not have any data on head circumference. It is an observation our neurologist has made over many years. I am %1,000 not a doctor. You should really talk to a doctor. I am just a parent who has seen and read a lot. I am only qualified to give dumbed down descriptions and the observations of one patient to shed light to others.  By 18mos of age the crainial sutures are fused and the skull size/shape is set, so no, your head will not shrink if CSF is drained via a shunt. No. This is correct. How come ? So if you shrink the brain by removing  the fluid the  skull is just going to remain the size Your skull will fuse at a certain age.  It will only expand slightly if you are an adult with hydro.  Babies will have a decrease in size as the fluid has been removed and the skull is not fused yet. So if you have undiagnosed congenital hydrocephalus  and your 17 years old and get it treated and then you brain returns to the size it was ment to be your skull will not shrink to compensate the extra space between the brain and skull Age depending", "When you are not allowed to take a shower Hello,\n\nstupid question but do you good experiences with any kind of wet towels for the time you are not allowed to shower after a shunt surgery? I just had a sponge bath until they removed all my stitches I showered after my several revisions. I had to wait for the bandages to come off, but no problems with just the staples in my head. I did get a shower chair during this time as I was not all that coordinated yet. I had waterproof plasters and had first shower week after the surgery I was able to shower after three days. Two weeks of no showering for me \n\nDefinitely took daily baths though - usually with some nice Epsom salts I just had ETV surgery and did not shower for 3 days, hair wash in 5 days. Everything stayed intact. The wife had me wearing a shower cap at first. After my ETV I was allowed to shower but was not allowed to have water run directly over the surgery scar and had to use baby shampoo on it instead of regular", "interested in any input regarding my grandfather (he doesnt have a shunt) i live with my grandfather who is 83, he suffers from hydrocephalus. he cannot talk, walk, roll over move his arms above the elbow and struggles to blink. he also has severe demetia that began around the age of 70.he was diagnosed in his mid 60s and after a lot of discussion and investigations it became clear he was not a candidate for a shunt. so the fluid is just building up and affecting his CNS. this week he had violent hiccups that were making him very uncomfortable. he would moan in between each hiccup and as the day progressed the moaning would get worse. around the same time of the onset of hiccups he began to struggle to swallow his drinks and food. we were concerned he may have had a stroke and are still unsure of exactly what is happening. i did some reading and found out that the CNS damage can make the diaphram misbehave and that can cause hiccups.\n\nwe have a doctor coming to see him tomorrow but i have a bit of a tricky situation.  my aunt is my grandfathers main carer and can be very dismissive of my concerns. the thing is she doesnt live here meaning she doesnt witness everything i do. she also has never really read much about hyrocephalus, i read and was the one to inform her what could cause the hiccups. \n\nif you have gotten this far, thank you. i guess im venting  but i also want to know what to excpect as the illness progresses. i want to be ready for what is going to happen. im honestly keen to chat with somebody who knows, even just somebody with the condition. it would also be nice to talk to somebody with a loved one who has been struggling with this condition.\n\nthank you for reading :) That sounds like normal pressure hydrocephalus. That may help you in your research. I am not as familiar with it though all hydrocephalus cases as similar in them at they are characterized by a build of of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). I do not know what would cause someone to not be a candidate for a shunt.", "Does the thought of not having health insurance scare you?  Yes! I am going into college, so I only have a few more years on my parent's. I have heard so many horror stories of people not being able to pay for their surgeries anyway, or of people having cruddy doctors who mess up surgeries because they could not get better insurance to go to a specialist. I want to go into biological research, but do not know what kind of health insurance that will get me. I am afraid of being fired because of some sort of issue since that would leave me without health insurance.  Unfortunately, yes the healthcare system in America is so broken that those of us with this condition simply cannot take the risk of going without health insurance.  Even with health insurance though, just one revision will get you close if not completely max out your out of pocket costs which can be quite a bit.  I am fortunate enough to have a pretty good job with decent insurance so I cannot say that it scares me.  It does frustrate me quite a bit though to think about all of the vacations/nice things I could have if I did not have to pay through the nose to keep living through a condition obtained through no fault of my own. yeah, but there are also people who post about not being able to get treatment or having to wait for months because their headaches and stuff are not deemed \"bad\" enough for them to have the surgery immediately, so they progressively get worse. I am more afraid of that, especially if I live outside the States for a travel abroad program or something.  Kind of. When I was on my parents insurance I had to get two surgeries. Those were the only surgeries I had since being initially diagnosed. I currently do not have health insurance but I am also very lucky that I have had very few complications. My parents are worried that something will happen and I will not be insured, but as long as you are careful and know when something is wrong, it should be okay.  My mom's thought was \"what happens if you are not insured and it messes up tomorrow on its own ?\"  Yeah, I wish I could just cruise along like that, but the last two surgeries I had we did not know I would need them. Two weeks before the last surgery we went in with symptoms of failure and they sent me home because my ventricles were not large enough. Then I thought I had food poisoning, went back to bed, and was incoherent and confused in the morning and had to be taken for surgery. The other one we knew would happen but we did not know when.  Absolutely.  I have been working for the same company for my entire adult life (2019 is my 20th year fulltime with them).  I had planned on an entirely different career but by the end of college I realized that job stability was worth a lot more to me.\n\nI am really, really fortunate to have had the right talent and have been in the right place at the right time, because I will never have to worry about not having insurance, or not having enough sick time to recover from multiple revisions.  I think about it often, and I wish that all Americans could be in the same position. Quite frankly, the idea that headaches coming clearly as a result of hydrocephalus not being bad enough is perhaps the worst part about the system as it stands today.  Quite frankly, if you traveled abroad to a western European nation with nationalized healthcare you would probably be better off than being in the US. ", "Accomplishments ( let us hear them! ) Hey all! I hope everyone is doing well in these crazy times that we are living in.\n\nBeing quarantined at home I have gone through a lot of emotions.

This may sound like a strange question, but I was trying to touch base with people who have experience with NPH.\n\nMy father had a stroke back in November last year. Since then he is been recovering in some ways but going backwards in others.\n\nIn the days after the stroke he had a facial droop and weakness in his right side which has improved gradually.\n\nBut one thing that is getting worse is his balance. He uses a cane to get around and has had quite a few instances of falling over while standing, and really struggling to get up off a couch or out of bed. \n\nCompare to the last few years his cognitive abilities have not changed that much (He is always complained of bad memory).\n\nWhen he walks he used to stand upright - almost like he was marching. But I recall a time about 3 weeks BEFORE his stroke that his walking pace slowed substantially and he started to develop what we jokingly called his \"old man shuffle\" (he is 67).\n\nLately my mother told me that he has developed a urinary incontinence.\n\nI guess the fact that his \"changes\" started before the official stroke make me wonder if he has had a condition for longer which has been gradually getting worse - in particular, I am wondering if he should be checked out for NPH.\n\nWould anyone here care to describe their experiences with the condition? \n\nTIA! So I am like super young for NPH, but I have it. And yeah, that sounds exactly like it. I would definitely get it checked. Thanks for responding. I have congenital hydro myself (with a 30 yo VPL shunt) - and I am familiar with the vomiting and headaches associated with a shunt malfunction. \n\nWhat I am wondering is - in a NPH scenario, is your experience different? Do you get the headaches as well? Actually my condition has been stable for five years so they have only been monitoring me. My doc is pushing off surgery until absolutely necessary. I get dizzy spells and headaches but nothing as bad as when I was first diagnosed. My brain is extra weird, I guess :) It is my understanding that the three hallmarks of NPH are incontinence, a shuffling gait and dementia type symptoms (memory issues, confusion, etc).\n\nI would have him checked. I also would like to chime in to suggest that you have him checked. My mom has been \u201cliving\u201d with NPH for decades. Hi - my father in law (73) was in hospital from the end of April to mid-June with complications caused by a type of hydropcephalus. I had never heard of the condition, and followed this sub as a result of this to do a bit of learning.\n\nThe neurologists/neurosurgeons think that one of his ventricles in his brain has been blocked for quite a long time, perhaps since birth. They described that this, likely over the last few years, has been \"de-compensating\" in that, for his whole life, his brain/body may have been able to compensate for the condition but that as the brain ages and naturally shrinks his brain/body is strarting to be lose the ability to compensate for the condition.\n\nUnlike your father, he has not had a stroke (that we know of).\n\nLike your father, over the last few months his balance/gait became inscreasingly more \"unusual\" and, as you describe, he struggled to go from a sitting position to standing, get out of bed, and walk without a stoop/dragging his feet slightly. A seemingly common symptom of hydrocephalus is that sufferers describe a sensation of being \"frozen on the spot\" when they do eventually manage to stand up. He also had falls, as you describe.\n\nUnlike your father, his cognitive ability seemingly declined at roughly the same rate as his balance, and basic cognition began to fail (you would ask him a simple question and confusion was plain on his face).\n\nThe culmination of all of this was a couple of bad falls, and the confusion reaching the worst it had been. We knew at this point that something was really not right, and a visit to the GP ensued. Basically, the GP's advice was: \"Hospital. Now.\"\n\nHe was in the hospital for some weeks whilst observations were made and tests were carried out, culminating in an operation to alleviate the pressure. After some rehabilitation for a few weeks after the op, he has improved considerably. I would note here that neurosurgeons always make clear that their primary objective is to halt the condition as opposed to any reversal of symptoms occuring, and results vary quite dramatically on a per-patient basis.\n\nWe are currently waiting the results of his post-op 6-week MRI.\n\nI am really sorry for the novel-like response, and sorry to hear that your dad is having problems, but TL;DR - This condition seems to present itself differently in different people, so I would get him checked as soon as possible. Best wishes to you and your family. Thank you for such an in-depth response. It is very helpful to understand the experience of others. \n\nMy father does not have obvious signs of \"dementia\". He has always been and continues to be a total smart-arse. He would rather make jokes than talk seriously about his condition and how we can help him. \n\nI hope the condition of your FIL can be improved - it is terrible watching those we love decline. No worries, and thank you! OP, Thank you so much for your post. I am going through a similar situation with my dad. I will not go into details... It brings me much needed peace knowing there is someone out there like me and my dad just trying to keep fighting for a better future for ourselves. As a caregiver to another, your work means the world to your father, taking care of a parent when they need you is brave. It is grueling work. It is not fun. But we bring comfort to the people who created us and I owe my dad that much, to give him the comfort he deserves. I wish I had my mother to help my dad, but she is gone now and my dad is all I have left. I would give anything for him to not feel so trapped in his own body, limited. We are seeing the neurologist soon.\n\nAppreciate your mom while you still have her. Thank her for helping you father through this as well. You both, you give life back to someone who would not have one without you guys. \n\nThank you, OP. For letting me vent and sharing", "Anyone else have hydro because of genes I do not have hydrocephalus but my son does. He is 2 and had a shunt. We went to get a genetic test when he was born. There was something wrong with a gene called mpdz. I was wondering if anyone else has that gene mutation. It seems pretty common in people with Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome and people who have brain tumors near the pineal gland outside of that. My understanding is that hydrocephalus is typically a secondary condition caused by something else.  I had a cyst as an infant and was diagnosed with hydrocephalus in college.

Crazy part is that they would not of found out either because I had no side effects whatsoever leading up to them finding the tumor. The only reason they realized it was there was because I had lost my glasses at school, needed a new prescription, and they noticed swelling behind my eyes.

I was waiting for her to send referrals so my son could get some help in school. I have called the office several times and then the psychological testing place looking for the referrals right? Everyone was nice and helpful trying to figure out what happened.Well then last week I got a call from the Neurology place. They told me that his Dr was only SUGGESTING neuropsych testing. Smh. They said they do not deal with \"behavioral\" problems so therefore they are refusing to write referals. Nevermind that while i was there in person they were open to helping with. They told me to ask our primary care to write referrals.The whole point of the neuropsych testing is to see what damage may have been caused at birth so he does not fall any further behind in school. I looked it up and he certainly qualifies with his medical history for proper testing. I am so angry that 2 months wasted waiting on paperwork to be signed to get put on a waiting list for the testing. I feel like the school is pushing to have him diagnosed with something because they do not want to deal with him. He is strugging in school. Always in trouble. I have asked for them to write me something stating the issues so i have documentation but I have not been given anything in writing.They lied to my face about a local program that could help him with possible learning disabilities. Thankfully I did an intake appt for that program already but we are also on a waiting list for that :( I am completely lost now as to what to do as this school year is almost over and nobody seems to want to do their job. I am going to keep searching until i find someone who will help us.  Have you seen a neurosurgeon not just a neurologist? Yes. I wish I had a miracle cure. I have a shunt and have had 4 surgeries. But the shunt has not taken care of everything. Just remember you are not alone. Thank you! I had hoped when he had the shunt put in that over time more research would come out with alternative treatments. Everyone i meet who knows nothing about shunts ask me if it will be life long. Yeah I have had other headaches besides and there are days it gets extremely frustrating.  Like today. My head has been killing me for 2 weeks. Not sure where I go next.\n\nPlease feel free to keep in touch here. If nothing else I can sure listen/read. Does it get worse with weather changes or allergy season? He doesnt complain much about his head.  Yes to both. Especially when a change in weather is a day or so away. That is when I am the worst.", "Prep for surgery #4 Other than the obvious cleaning what do I have to do to prepare my house for my surgery? You do not actually have to clean your house any more than usual. Shunt revision surgery is pretty basic. Recovery from anesthesia is about your main concern. Just try and relax. Enjoy some movies or other relaxing hobby.  Oh ok my boyfriend said he was going to wash my sheets the night before and I bought sheets for when I come home That is awesome. Definitely treat yourself!  Yes I want ice cream before my surgery Yeah, there is not much to do. Just be sure to relax. Good luck!  how routine is it when your surgeon is telling you that the shunt is disconnected, turning into bone, going to shatter and is sticking to your insides? He said my brain might bleed and he was going to try to get as much of the tubbing out as he could Thanks They said my kitty had to sleep in the living the day after my surgery \u2639\ufe0f That may be because sometimes if they sleep with you they get curious about the tape and try to play with it ", "My son has COVID help and advice My son Patrick is 15. Also has adhd and autism. I just got the notification at 2am on Sunday. We got tested last Sunday so he should be okay. Will be notifying Dr and surgeon tomorrow. \nJust wondering if anyone knows of long term affects this will have on him.\nHe had his first surgery at 17 months, then at 23 months - last one at 29 months. He has a VP shunt, it is currently leaking more then it should, dr not doing anything about it (seeing different Childrens hospital on the 3rd)\nThanks", "Questions. I would like to ask a few questions if I may.\n\nHow long have you had your shunt, and how many revisions have you had? \n\nWhat kind of shunt do you have?\n\nWere you born with hydrocephalus or were you diagnosed because of something else? \n\nIs hydrocephalus considered a disability? I have had a shunt since may 2019. It was vp programmable but got infected   before leaving the hospital so was removed and a few weeks later replaced with a non programmable fixed low to mid pressure shunt. \n\nMy hydrocephalus is a result of a partially removed brain tumour.\n\nAs my day to day life is not impacted drastically it is not considered a disability for me, I think this is usually down to the side effects you feel. - Since 1986 (when I was ~10 weeks old).\n- Zero revisions. None. Zip. Nada. Zilch.\n- VP shunt (Pudenz-Heyer valve)\n- I was born with it! Congenital.\n- It depends on if there are other complications like Spina Bifida, which I do not have. For all intents and purposes it has absolutely 0 effect on my life, though I am still ultra careful about my safety (especially when it comes to my head!). Jeebus, lucky you :) Daughter has had a vp programmable for 12 years, no revisions. Result of spina bifida. Dude! Me too!\n\n-1986 (i think it was 5months)\n-no revisions\n-VP shunt Yeah, my medical notes also said something like \"Reason unknown\", which is hard to read. Like.. why me? Why?\n\nIt thankfully has very little impact on my life, apart from that I do not do physical contact sport or anything that gets my heart rate up too much like that, but I am in very good condition health and fitness-wise generally, so all good. I was a 10 week premature baby I have had my shunt since I was 2 weeks Old \nI was born and had a brain bleed at the time of birth which was the reason for the insertion of the device I have hydrocephalous secondary\n to cerebalpalsy as well as beckwith weidmann syndrome I have every characteristic of the BWS I had a Revision in 2001, Replaced in 2009 and again in 2019 I had my Appendix  Rupture in July of 19 and the tubing was in my belly where it had been since 2009 they rerouted it to my heart it is now a VA shunt and I am doing fine \ud83e\udde1\n\nI am fighting to get my disability I am 28 I have worked in the past but I now know that my brain due to short term memory loss along with my other condiitions I can not work I am fighting for my life every day with this shunt in my head hope this helps I believe I got my shunt put in in 1986. \nMy body rejected it once. The second one was fine.\nIt is not programmable. \nI was born with it. \n\nWhen I was about 10, my shunt broke in a couple places. I was very ill and had really bad headaches for a week or two. I passed out once. I think I got sent to the ER twice. Eventually I got better. My body started doing what it was supposed to be doing, so I never had to get a new shunt and the never took out the old one.", "How safe are stud finder\u2018s to use. I have had a vp shunt since I was 3 years old I was told not to use a stud finder by my parents did not know if they were just being overly cautious. The magnet in a stud finder is pretty weak, so I would doubt it could interfere with a VP shunt if it contains a magnetic control element. That said, not all vp shunts have magnets in them (mine did not, originally installed in 2012). Ask your doctor if you are really not sure though. Why would someone be told this? I have had several VP shunt revisions and sorry...but if you can go through a MRI with a shunt, I find it hilarious that someone thinks a stud finder would cause a patient problems.\n\nI have a Codman Hickman Programmable shunt and have NEVER been told that stud finders will be a problem and I do not think a VP Shunt is going to make you have issues with a stud finder.\n\nInstead of asking people on a website, I think you should be conferring with your doctor instead of your parents or anyone on a site such as this.", "Mom just diagnosed with hydrocephalus, brain tumor Hi all. I had never heard of hydrocephalus until about 12 hours ago. My mom, 55 years old and retired less than a year after a full career of public school teaching, looking forward to a retirement of snow bird-ing and expecting her first grandchild, has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus. She has a mass at the base of her head that caused the problem with the flow of cerebral fluid. \n\nShe has never had any health problems of note before. A couple months ago, she started to mix little things up, had a day where she just could not stay balanced, and one day threw up seemingly without reason (I can think of the times mom has gotten ill in my lifetime on one hand). In the past month and a half, she started to get severe headaches in the front of her head that she calls \u201cthunder headaches\u201d, and her balance got worse. She went to her primary care provider and they were not sure what could be causing it. They referred her to a neurologist who prescribed her a medication for migraines and set up an MRI \u201cjust to make sure\u201d for a couple weeks from now. In the past week, she deteriorated quickly and noticeably. \n\nShe is all but unable to walk for her vertigo, headaches wake her up in the morning and recur every time she so much as turns her head, so she became effectively bedridden. Just before it reached that point, she passed out in the garden and my dad found her, she did not know what happened. She had another puking incident. I also noticed her handwriting on the calendar\u2014it has changed from the small, neat, half-cursive hand I have always known to a large, sloppy scrawl, gone over as she clearly tried to fix her letters. For some reason this detail was an emotional tipping point for me because it gave me a glimpse of how altered her faculties really are. I begged her for days to go to the ER instead of waiting two weeks for her MRI and finally, yesterday, she did. They have done two CT scans and two MRIs so far and there is a 3 cm mass at the base of her head. They have given her steroids to keep swelling at bay and will operate today. \n\nI am still working out what that operation will be and what the options for hydrocephalus treatment are called. I was not allowed to be at the hospital with my mom and dad due to health restrictions still in the area, so I am getting this all secondhand through my dad. I am thankfully allowed to go in today now that she is moved on from the emergency department. It is the wee, wee hours of the morning right now, so visiting hours will not start for a while. \n\nI am terrified that she has reached a critical point and something will happen before they can operate today, or that it is too late. My dad is inconsolable. They have been married since they were 17. I am their only child and am pregnant with my first child. I am incredibly close to my mom. We really cannot lose her, we are all so unprepared. I hope that there is hope. Sending you a message. If it is any consolation, I am 61 and my hydrocephalus symptoms manifested very quickly as well, culminating in my falling into the bathtub and taking out the shower curtain. And once they drained me and installed the shunt...it was almost an immediate turnaround.\n\nKeeping my fingers crossed for you. I have a brain tumour and as a result hydrocephalus ( body tried to produce extra csf because tumour was blocking the flow). \n\nIt is scary i know and it is just as hard for family as the patient. Once it is removed they can then hopefully identify the tumour. Often people may have a small op initially ( biopsy) but it is good that they have managed to remove. \n\nThat initial diagnosis stage is terrifying, just be there for each other. \n\nThe shunt will help control the symptoms hopefully. Charity websites are the best source of information  bug for now just look after each other. \n\nP.s we have a brain tumour subreddit too. My 64 year old dad had his shunt surgery in February 2021. Hydrocephalus sounded so scary when I first heard about it too but when I did more research, I found that it is very common. The shunt procedure is very common too, even though it sounded terrifying to me. My dad also has a brain tumor and is completing 5 weeks of radiation. Before the shunt surgery, he was dragging his feet when he walked, could not control his bladder, was forgetting a lot, and was unbalanced when walking. After the surgery, it all disappeared! It was crazy to see him walk in a straight line with his head high. So, there is hope! I think the issue with older patients is the recovery process. For my dad, it took some time but he is slowly getting back to his old self again. Hoping for a speedy recovery for your mom! \u2764\ufe0f Hopefully your mom improves dramatically with a shunt. It often happens.\n\nAnd hopefully they can address that tumor effectively.\n\nI am sorry you are going through this. I am only 25 and I went through the same thing at 20 (I had an arachnoid cyst that was very large, causing headaches and extreme dizziness, confusion, the works). Your mom is very lucky to have a child who cares for her so much and pays attention! You all are doing the right things. Thank you for sharing. Did they tell you what kind of tumor it is? Did they remove it completely, partial removal, or was it in a risky location? No, I have never learned what kind of tumor it was. :-( I could only take so much time off work, so after I had to go back to work, I had to get word through my dad secondhand and he is not always the best at recounting information. At one point when I was there, the doctor did come in and say that they were fairly certain it was not cancerous\u2014it was made out of brain cells rather than originating elsewhere in the body (i.e. a spread of cancer). It was sent for biopsy but I have not heard about that so far. He did refer to it as a tumor, though. \nIt was completely removed, is not expected to grow back, and chemo &amp; radiation will not be needed barring a bad biopsy. It was a difficult removal insofar as it had its own blood supply it had been there so long, so she hemorrhaged when they removed it and needed a blood transfusion. I am STILL not completely clear on where it was located, but I am thinking she is experiencing some kind of aphasia that, because of placement, has to be Wernicke\u2019s. That seems to be her worst symptom. Her motor skills were the bigger concern, again because of placement, but are recovering much more quickly than her speech. This sounds like great news assuming the pathology is a slow growing grade 1 tumor. I wish your mom a good recovery!", "Vision Changes So last week I met with a new ophthalmologist (old one moved)... Anyway in the year since I got my last glasses prescription my vision has changed drastically for the worse in both eyes. Anyone have this happen so quickly? Any advice? I am going to try and get a second opinion this week just in case Could be optic nerve damage.  When I was born I had a shunt fail and it was not replaced for 3 weeks and as a result I now have 20/80 corrected vision  and shaky eyes I have thinned optic nerves from hydro already more on the right than the left. Plus a right sided lazy eye. Do you think my nerve is just getting weaker? I do not know really as I am not a doctor and do not know the nature of your hydro but I do know for me after my last revision last year my vision is noticeably worse.  I have not had an eye appointment to confirm yet what it is. Hi there,\n\nMy shunt malfunctioned over the last year, but we were not able to pinpoint what was going on at the time. I got my vision corrected (I wear contacts) in March of 2020. It had gotten 4 steps better as far as me being nearsighted. \n\nFast forward to September, my vision was completely off again and was blurry while wearing my contacts. Also I was having periods of time where my vision would be slightly double and not focused. \n\nWhen I went back to the eye doctor, they took a picture of the back of my eye and I had fluid all around my optic nerve and swelling. At that point we knew that my shunt flat out was not working properly.\n\nI had my shunt revised in October and my vision has now returned back to what it was before March.\n\nIf you go to an eye doctor, make sure you get a picture of the back of your eyes, it could be a game changer like it was for me. They did a pic but my optic nerve has always had problems so it is kind of hard to tell if something is going on or not", "I have had a VP shunt that has never been changed since I was 6 months old. I am 28 years old now. I have had chronic fatigue for years, ever since highschool at least. In recent months, my appetite has decreased, I get really irritable, and I experience frequent confusion. My uneducated opinion is that it is very likely shunt failure. I had a CT scan from a family doctor who said my brain ventricles appear smaller than normal and \u201cslit like\u201d. This sounds to me like over-drainage because of the symptoms I am having. The thing is I do not have headaches... at all... even when I was sick with the flu last year. The two neurologists that I saw would disagree with me that it is shunt failure. \n\nLet me give you an example of my confusion. I have two towels on the rack in my bathroom. I got out of the shower for a few seconds and when my shower was done, I realized the floor was all wet. Instead of doing the logical thing and using one towel to dry the floor and throw in the laundry basket to wash later and use the other towel, I got a pair of jeans to wipe up the floor. I did not think to use the other towel. The jeans did not work very well to dry the floor, so I left it. I am 28 years old and seem to have the problem solving skills of a teenager. It might be that, but I think the CT scan would have picked up more if not as the scan can monitor drainage as I understand it.  In addition, you might be overthinking the confusion part - especially when we are multitasking or thinking about a lot of things at once people just do that. I know I do on occasion (healthy or not) and so do others. Mistakes happen, but if your systems progress then obviously head to emerg. Almost everyone develops slit like ventricles after having a shunt for a long time. All shunts overdrain a little (when working) and cause slit vents. It is normal. If it were a shunt issue, you would most likely have a headache. \nThose symptoms sound like something else. And if you have seen a neurologist and not a neurosurgeon, you should see a neurosurgeon.\nI had slit ventricles for 5 years before having a shunt failure which was caused by a sudden blockage. I also had a 24/7 headache for 5 years due to some under drainage. When I was 10, my shunt broke in a couple places. I had really bad headaches and nausea/vomiting for a couple of weeks.", "Looking for parents experience with their children's diagnosis process Long story short my 9 month old had a routine checkup yesterday. She is slightly delayed in meeting her milestones so the Dr was concerned. She measured her head and it measured off the charts (although to us and family no one has noticed that she has an abnormally large head). Dr is concerned that there is fluid in the brain causing pressure and that is what is delaying her progress. Needless to say me and my wife are scared to death and I am over here thinking the worst. I am wondering if anyone had similar circumstances and wound up with a hydro diagnosis TIA My baby has hydro and his head used to be off the charts due to fluid. After the VP shunt surgery at 7 weeks old, his head became more proportional (around the 80th percentile, I think). He is almost 6 month old now, and mostly meeting developmental milestones, although we do work with a physiotherapist. Feel free to PM me any questions! So depending on how bad the hydro is that totally could be the case. My son would not last that long as he has it due to a brain bleed. I would get that baby in for an MRI as soon as you possibly can Well, your prognosis is already quite positive. Been diagnosed this late means the hydro would not be so severe and most likely developed slowly or after birth. \n\nOnce shunted ,your kid will absolutely show an increase in development,if the shunt is working. My son was shunted at 12 months. He was not delayed,but after his shunt was placed. He was very happy! Waiting on insurance approval \ud83d\ude11 My baby had a shunt placed at about the same age. After placement, and a revision, he developed rapidly. He is now a 6\u20194\u201d 19 year old basketball playing college student in honors classes with a good job. \nIt was a shock that he needed a new shunt placed last week, but he is coming through. It brought all of the same emotions that we felt when he was a baby. He will be back to work next week and cleared for basketball next month. College in the fall. \nVery few people who have not been where you are can understand. You have my respect for posting and your family has my deepest sympathy and humble prayers. Tip-Bug the crap out of your insurance. And also if you find like a supervisor or someone who is in your corner (or anyone from docs to nurses to hospital staff) keep in contact with them. Insurance can take their sweet time with approving anything and it is better to get this diagnosed as early as possible. But having people in your corner is a lifesaver. \n\nMy daughter was diagnosed at 4m and had her first surgery (ETV) and then had a second surgery (shunt) at 8m. We battled insurance a lot especially trying to get the MRI at 8m because the hsp had to schedule 3m out and the insurance company would not approve that far out. It was a mess. You are your child\u2019s biggest advocate so being insistent (not rude or overbearing, just insistent) in my experience will help the journey. \n\nDid your doc send you for an ultrasound? That is how we got our primary diagnosis. An eye doc can also tell if there is pressure on the optic nerve. Do not know if that will matter for insurance but it might help you know what is going on. \n\nI highly suggest checking out the Hydrocephalus Association. I have learned a lot through them. Same! Huge developments after shunted for my daughter. Hope she is doing well!", "Weather changes Hello all,\n\nI have had a rough last 4 days. I was sitting at work and out of nowhere I got a sharp migraine, and I have had it since. It is been behind my eyes and in my sinus area, but now turning into a what I thought was a shunt malfunction. So I went and got my pressure checked, but it was where it needed to be (1.5)\nIt looks like this might be my new normal for now. How do you guys cope with constant back pain/headaches? When I get high pressure symptoms (which is quite often even with a working shunt) I use hot- or ice packs on my neck and head, depending on what feels better in the moment. What also helps me is to be at least a bit active, allthough you might not feel like it. Showers also help dampen the pain a little for a few hours.\n\nI also try to get my mind off of it, that seems to help not getting overwhelmed by the pain. If that happens I start worrying too much about a possible malfunction, which it almost never is when I have high pressure symptoms. I suffer from migraines in addition to having hydrocephalus so you can imagine I have frequent scares. What helps me honestly is taking excedrin. Have you tried that? A few of things that really help me are:\n\n1) Having a barometer in my house. It does not help the headache, but it makes it pretty obvious when I am having a weather headache.\n\n2) Placing a cold cloth on my eyes/nose bridge and also the back of my neck. (If the cold is not enough use a magic sac out of the freezer.)\n\n3) Practicing reflexology on myself. I never believed in this prior to 2003, but when I needed emergency revision in the UK unexpectedly I was lucky enough to meet a nurse who was well versed in it. There is a week in London I barely remember, but the one clear memory I have is of lying in this doctors office and for the first time in days I could open my eyes and look around and talk to my mum for a few minutes without needing to vomit.

This is a weird post. Sorry. I am out of the country and trying to get home. My dad just had a shunt put in on Wed. He is suffering from Hydrocephalus. Unfortunately I am relying on my elderly mother for info and she says that yesterday the surgeon stopped by and turned OFF his shunt and said it was \"draining too much\". Is that a thing? She said he said to call monday and set up an appointment at the office for next week. What is weird is this all happened in the hospital. He turned it off while Dad was still in the hospital. He was moved over to skilled nursing last night. \n\nIf there was an issue, would not he go in a fix it while he is at the hospital? There is also the possibility that my Mom is not relaying all of the info. However, she is certain he turned it OFF. This is a really highly regarded surgeon and after the surgery, he said he was very pleased with the procedure. \n\nCan anyone shed any possible scenarios where this might happen? I know my info is spotty but that is really all I know. I will not possibly hear anything more till monday.\n\nThank you", "Running makes me dizzy/gives me a headache I have a VP shunt, right side. I am due for a checkup so I will be scheduling the doctor soon but I wanted to ask if anyone else gets this. \n\nI ran 2 miles today, more than usual for me but not a ridiculous amount, and after I went to sit down and my head was screaming. Standing up I was only slightly dizzy. I have noticed slight dizziness after running but nothing major and it resolves quickly but I have never had such a headache in years and it seemed to be bc of the sitting? Has anyone else had this happen? I used to have shunts before I got my ETV and am an avid runner. I have never had pain issues like that, though it is important to note that everyone is different that way. It may just be something to do with changing blood flow upon sitting/standing, which can happen after a run where blood flow is still altered. \n\nOther things to consider are:\n-Weather during your run\n-How you were before you ran\n-medications\n\nIt is something I would bring up to a doctor if it happens again though. There is no sense in trying to tough something out when a doctor could have a valid solution.", "Shunt infection or malfunction? I have had pain along my VP shunt tubing for the past couple days on and off around my collar bone. Today I noticed I have soreness on my shoulder and neck only on the side of my shunt. Should I be concerned? Be mindful the shunt in it is entirety is a foreign body. The body will always form scar tissue and calcium deposits around it. More than likely that is what it is. Scar tissue pain. Unless you have a fever and the site is warm to the touch I would not worry. Definitely warm to the touch and no fever today. I have never had this kind of pain or soreness in this area so I have been kind of freaking out. Will they scan to check for calcification you think? It can be warm to the touch and not be infected. I know if I over work my tube area it swells a bit. If I pull it too much it will swell. I would take an anti inflammatory (if you can) and try to ice or heat the area to relax it. If it still seems sore call your neurosurgeon. It is hard to see scar tissue unless you have an ultrasound done. Calcification will show up in X-rays and CT. But they will not go looking for it unless it is a serious issue like an infection or malfunction.", "Cannot find any medical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hydrocephalus in adults in general. Does anyone know of any? I have searched online for weeks but I cannot seem to find ANY medical guidelines for the diagnosis and management/treatment of hydrocephalus in general for adults. \n\nUsually organizations like NICE provide detailed comprehensive guidelines on most diseases. They are very detailed and help practitioners make decisions on diagnosis and treatments. I could only find one NICE guideline for Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus and Pediatric Hydrocephalus. Nothing for general hydrocephalus in adults. \n\nCAn someone provide a link to a medical guideline for diagnosis and management of general hydrocephalus in adults? Tried researching it as well.  Finally gave up Once they put in the shunt, its just about getting the flow correct and avoiding infection and other complications. There is not really much more to it than that. Infection is the biggest thing. I know about this because I am an adult male who just had his shunt removed less than a year ago. If I was still shunt dependent I would have had another one put in the next day. I asked what that would mean long term and my doctor (Michael Muhonen in Southern California) said \"You will just have another shunt. We may or may not have to adjust the flow. And we will have to keep an eye out for any infection signs in the first 2-3 weeks.\" Same procedure as when I first had it done at like 13 months old. My hydrocephalus was apparently a stenosis rather than complete blockage. Hydrocephalus is more of a disorder than a disease. Because of this I would think that what caused the manifestation of hydrocephalus in an adult would be more important regarding long term patient treatment than the condition itself. Look for shyma, stuff by dr Michael williams Well also shunt malfunction is almost always certain. So on top of infection the risk of the shunt just not working is the biggest thing. Since corriplexus builds up in the shunt, clogging it and preventing CSF so flow through. However they do have a new device out called the ReFlow device, which should help prevent the need for surgery when a malfunction arises. Hence the reason I said other complications. Gotcha, though that does slightly underplay the #1 complication for people with Hydrocephalus. Yes there is always a risk of infection, but only after surgery. Other than that, infection is not the main concern. It is shunt maintenance. Figuring out what setting works for you and recognizing when the shunt starts to malfunction. Since all shunts have a very high risk of malfunction. Even ETV\u2019s can malfunction (endoscopic third ventriculostomy). I know. I had my shunt for 28 years. Although I am one of the lucky ones who never had a problem of any kind. Got it partially removed last August so that is nice. Partially removed? That is not a thing,...the tubing has to be a certain length usually. Wait if it has not been working for six years how have you had zero problems? This does not make sense. Idk good luck to whatever you have going on dude.", "The irony of having a brain like a seive due to a tumour but needing a shunt from resulting hydrocephalus Is not lost on me... So you are saying the tumor made you smart? In what ways? Not exactly, I am saying it made me forgetful like the saying \" brain like a sieve \", you might be thinking sponge. But if my brain worked more like an actual sieve then it would not hold too much CSF \u300b and so would not need a shunt etc I see. Where is your tumor located. Sorry to hear you have to deal with all this. I had an arachnoid cyst near my cerebellum, not exactly a tumor, but it also resulted in hydrocephalus and I have a VP shunt now Hypothalamic 3rd ventricle. Low grade astrocytoma. Only reason it was operated on was size/pressure impacting me. They removed two thirds of it. Cyst the filled that gap but shunt helps. ( also vp shunt)", "What is your story?

He now has a VP shunt and is a year and a half old. The bleeds and hydro caused him to have low vision as well.  My twin sister and I were born 2.5 months premature. When I was a day old I had a brain hemorrhage that caused my hydro, and I had my first VP shunt put in when I was a month old.  I am now 40 and have had 26 surgeries total, including 17 shunt revisions.  I have had some vision issues as well that were mostly caused by my prematurity.  My last shunt revisions were in April/May 2012. My daughter had a brain hemorrhage that we discovered when she was about 10 days old. She was vomiting, had sunsetting eyes and a bulging Fontanel. She spent 21 days in the hospital with an external drain. She did not get a shunt, but has been monitored with ultrasounds and most recently a rapid mri to determine if she needs one. She is 15 months old now and seems to be doing fine but is slow to walk independently. How old were you when you found out you had hydrocephalus?  How is he doing now?  Geeze, I could not imagine going through this my whole life but you must be one hell of a strong person! Have any advice for a newb? He is doing well, thank you! He has quite a few medical complications and is doing amazing, he recently started crawling and pulling up and is working on walking. I am incredibly thankful that his shunt has been stable so far. :)  I am glad that she is doing better! Is the plan to monitor her? And I found out last October when I was 24 (turned 25 in November).  I am really happy to hear that! How long has he had the shunt?  I have arteries running into veins somewhere around my brain when I was born. It was found when I was 13 months old. I had an embolisation to stop the blood running into that area and a shunt put in at the same time. Within the next couple of years my ventricles collapsed and became rigid. The tiny ventricles cause my shunt not to work very well and block more often than normal. The least shunt revisions I have had in a year is 3 and the most is 15. My most recent one was November last year and I can feel my current shunt is on the way down.\n\nI am 26 now and I have had over 75 shunt revisions. I also had a subtemporal decompression cut on the right side of my skull when I was 7 but I do not think it helped all that much and it is mostly grown over now. Every now and then they talk about cutting it again and I decline. For anyone who has a surgeon suggest a subtemporal decompression, be aware that it is an awful surgery to go through, 10x worse than a shunt revision. I am not saying do not do it, but be prepared for the recovery to be long and painful. Thanks. :)  Shunts are great but they are not perfect, so I do not really worry about my hydro unless I start seeing symptoms over a longer period (more than a few days or so).  For me that means sleeping a lot more, or headaches that will not go away even with meds.  I would had 18 surgeries (including 10 shunt revisions) by the time I was nine, but I had a doc tell me then that they would get less frequent with age and that has proven to be true, I went almost 12 years between shunt revisions the last time (July 2000 - April 2012). Almost a year and a half! :) I think the first few years up to age 3 is prime shunt malfunction time because of their rapid growth. Fingers are crossed! I hope yours lasts a good long while! :) I was healthy and normal up until I was 16. I started having really intense headaches, and when get get an MRI when they found a brain tumour on my brain stem that was blocking the flow of spinal fluid. So they put in my shunt. Since then I have had two revisions. It is been very frustrating since I cannot ever drive and it has caused me to work a lot slower. I used to be one of the first ones to finish a test. Late to the party, but just found this thread while doing a search. I just found out during my anomaly scan that my little boy who is 19 weeks along has severe congenital hydrocephalus due to a blockage in his aqueduct. His ventricle is 17mm (normal is 10mm), his head is currently the size of a 21 week in utero baby and it has significantly decreased the size of his brain. We have an appointment with a paediatric neurologist next week for an MRI and to discuss \"options\". \n\nIt is hard to come to terms with it. Thus far it looks as though he will have mental and physical disabilities. Keeping all fingers crossed that the outcome is not as grim as they believe at this point. Hearing these stories of people leading healthy lives while living with hydrocephalus is keeping me together. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a Try to stay positive but be prepared for the worst if that makes sense. I have met a lot of people who had hydrocephalus and have the giant ventricles instead of the tiny ones like me and they have no disability at all. Please post any questions you have and we will try to answer them from our own experiences.\n\nGood luck! Hello - want you to know you are not alone. My wife and I found out at the end of December at a 18 wk checkup that our son has ventriculomegaly due to aqueductal stenosis. At the time his vents were @ 19 and 21. She is high risk, so we were getting frequent sonograms. Her last one, just 3 wks before, were great. Nothing wrong. Then this one, and our world turned upside down. \n\nSince then, we have put him in the hands of the best pediatric neurosurgeons and Fetal Medicne doctors the US has. We have done half a dozen ultrasounds since that day and 2 MRIs. At the last one, at CHoP, he was at 24 &amp; 25mm, with areas they deemed 'break through' - places his white brain matter have been breached by the vents. That was at 20 wks, and already able to confirm there will be atrophy of his WBM. \n\nWith significant impact this early on, and delivery at wk 36 at the earliest, there is so much time in front of him, where it will get much worse before we can do anything to help him. We have a 2yo daughter who knows him by name and gives him hugs and kisses every night, which is very tough to smile through. \n\nI feel helpless and powerless as a father and spouse - my wife is distraught and hurting so badly. Crying every night. She is in a fog. We are heartbroken for our little boy and cannot bring ourselves to gamble with his life and quality of, by bringing him into this world. \n\nThere are miracle stories all over the internet. But for every one of those, there are 100s of 'typical' outcomes. It will be very confusing for you, as you continue to search for answers. Just know that every case of hydro is so different than the others. Their story is not yours. Our story is not yours. \n\nAs a bearing mother, you have amazing intuition - trust yourself and your judgement. But listen to the docs, make sure you have the pediatric neurosurgeon present and do not leave until you are confident in their answers and diagnosis (even if you may not agree). \n\nIt will get worse before it gets better, but it will get better eventually. At least, that is what we are now praying for. Peace, clarity and the ability to find joy and light in this very dark place we find our family in.  Why cannot you ever drive? And I can understand your frustration. I used to be very sharp, when I earned my associates degree I graduated with high honors. Learning new things used to be a breeze and now it is become a challenge. How old are you now?  Why have you had to have so many revisions to your shunt? I could not even imagine all that you have been though. You are incredibly strong \u2764 I have had mild brain damage. I am very slow to rest to stimuli. Now I am 17 going on 18. My tiny collapsed and rigid ventricles seem to be the problem. They do not expand at all when I have increased pressure so I think the shunt just struggles a bit to draw properly and then blocks. I posted on r/neurosurgery a while back to see if anyone had any thoughts but the consensus was that slit ventricles are very hard to treat. \n\nI am lucky in that I have never known what it is like to not have a shunt so I feel really bad for people who get one as adults and then experience shunt blockage for the first time. I did have a few of good years towards the end of high school and the start of uni and I started to think it had gotten a bit better. Then over the last 4 years or so I have had one every few months. After this reprieve from revisions for a while and then going back into it, I can see why it would be both annoying and confusing for people going through it for their first time. I am in academia so there is lots of work flexibility too. Your story is identical to ours except my wife was pregnant with Twins. One of the boys was diagnosed at 19 weeks.  We were told the same things you were told.  I mean what you wrote is almost word for word what we were told. My boys are now both 16 months old.  He had a short not put in and so far no issues with that. He still is a bit developmentally delayed. He seems to lag behind what his brother does by about a month. Other than that is a normal kid with the greatest smile is have ever seen. Do not lose hope. Great things can happen.  Super super late to the party. Anyway I am a fraternal twin and during the birth of me and my sister I was stuck in the birth canel. My mom said I was almost grey but damn pissed lol. Anyway I was born premature and had my shunt put in soon after my birth. After that I had to have my drainage tube lengthened at 5 and there was possibly a revision I do not remember. My last revision was 12 and I am 24 so I am hoping I will be good but I still get migraines and that can be scary but so far nothing of concern has happened. Also side note people who have had a similar situation how do you feel psychologically. I believe my problems are genetic and probably family based but I have been told I could have ptsd from my trauma. I mean...I hate hospitals and needles but outside that I am not sure if my underlying psychological issues are due to this. Anyway I would love feedback. Super, super late but I have got a doozy.\n\nMy name is Steve, 23, I was diagnosed in 2010 after many inconclusive doctors appointments. When the MRI found my hydro, the neurosurgeon decided then and there that emergency surgery was necessary. He then went in to perform a third ventriculostomy (no shunt), and unfortunately, the procedure did not go as planned. My high tolerance to anesthesia was not known about, or documented yet so this led to me waking up during the operation. I do not remember this at all, apparently I started violently thrashing my head, which caused the endoscope to puncture a blood vessel.\n\nI woke up from that incident two weeks later, shunt in place. Recovery after being bedridden for so long was difficult, to say the least. I was fortunate enough to make a full recovery and was back in school about a month later. Fast forward almost 7 years and I have been lucky to only have had 3 revisions, one later that year and two in 2016.\n\nSo sorry for the late respose, I hope some of you guys get to read it, I was amazed at what you all have said, I have never met another hydro before.  Sorry for the late reply. I have no idea if my hydrocephalus is the cause of my psychological problems, but they did not surface until after my first surgery. After my hydro diagnosis I was sent to therapy for serveral months. They said that I did not have PTSD, but that I was likey bipolar as that disorder is in my family for several generations. \n\nJust under a year ago I discovered that I am not in fact bipolar, but I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which explains my psychological issues. I love how we are all late to this party, so I am going to keep the ball slowly rolling. \n\nI am Adam from the UK., I was born a few weeks premature, and had a shunt fitted at some point in the first month. I have been incredibly lucky in that I have never had any further surgeries. I come and go with symptoms, and recently im in a headachy and nausea phase, but it is not so bad. It will pass soon.\n\nI have never met anyone else with Hydrocephalus, and only thought to check Reddit after I needed advice with Life insurance.\n\nI am 28 now and living a good life, the only permanent issue I have is with posture as I have kind of curved around the tube a bit. \n\nI have also called it my 'toobe' my entire life instead of a shunt, as my parents told me basically nothing about it. Well hello Adam! Glad you found us and I am glad to hear that you are doing well! I have issues with headaches and nausea too sometimes. I could not imagine having to grow up with this my whole life, it is been hard enough as a grown adult. \n\nAnd my thing is freaking people out by showing them the tube that runs down my neck and the brave ones get to feel the device on the back of my head. I guess I have a sick sense of humor haha \ud83d\ude01 I am sorry I am just now logging onto this account to read it! It sounds like you have been through a lot in such a short amount of time. I am happy you are doing well now and it does help to know that there are others out there. I have been fortunate enough to meet one other hydro in real life (at my neurosurgeon's) but other than that I know the feeling of telling people about hydrocephalus and getting blank stares.  I do that an the time, the look on people's faces when I say 'give me your hand' and put it in the pump is brilliant. \n\nMy shunt is old and has a little reservoir outside which you can drain manually which I only found out last year. Do you have a programmable shunt? How does that work?\n\n What the heck?! That is pretty cool. And I do have a programmable shunt. I guess it pretty much does it is thing and if the pressure starts building up I just go into my neurosurgeons office and have the setting changed to either a higher or lower number. There is 8 different settings, 8 being draining the least and 1 being the most. I am currently at a 5, I have had to get it changed a few times the first couple months after having the shunt placed to find out which number works best for me. 5 does not quite drain enough but 4 is too much so I am also on this medicine that makes your brain produce less fluid to even it out. How does your shunt work? That is interesting, so it is more like switching it to a setting, rather than programming? There is no USB :)\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, my shunt works by gravity alone. There is a valve to stop anything flowing back up. I think the reservoir is there so you can test if it is filling, but it is not really for pumping  manually. Other it is passive. Do you have batteries that need charging?  \n\nBeing gravity fed, it does mean I will not be heading into space anytime soon sadly.

Unfortunately I think space is out of the question for all of us haha. I can hardly deal with slight altitude change. And nope, no batteries. I wish this thing could be more fine tuned though, with how different people's brains are it amazes me that someone was like \"yup 8 settings\". \n\nAnd so on yours have you had any issues with under/over draining?", "New to Community (VP Shunt has been in for 18 years). I just found this sub and I am happy that I did.\nI am 23/M and I had my first shunt put in when I was 4 months old. I had a Dandy Walker Cyst that caused my hydrocephalus. Between 4 months and 5 years old I am not exactly sure how many revisions I have had but I do know it is at least 2-3. My last revision was when I was 5 years old.\nJust recently (about a month ago-ish), I felt a warm liquidity sensation around my tube tract at my neck. Did not get any severe symptoms but did feel a little more tugging than I have felt before. So I scheduled an appointment and got a CT Scan and 3 x-rays. I believe he said the CT scan showed the shunt still working but the X-ray did in fact show that the tube was in 2 pieces.\nFrom what I have read, that usually means they have to replace it...\nAccording to him, that is not the case for me?\nHe said \u201cthe body can sometimes create its own cavities for the CSF to flow through. If you have any of the worse symptoms, call me but if not, we will call you in a year and schedule a follow up.\u201d\nKind Of had me sitting there worry and confused.. Should I be worried? Fine?\nLike my title says, I have had this one for 18 years with no issues. Thanks for your help and input! Hi! Fellow DW + Hydro here. Mine has never been touched since put in when I was 2 months old, I am 36 now. Just had two revisions to extend the tubing while growing up.\n\nI am afraid I cannot help with the diagnosis but feel free to chat, it is super rare to find other people with DW to talk to - you are the first one I know! I would be really interested to compare our daily lives and all. Mine is also in a few pieces but seems to be working fine From what I understand, if there is not a real serious reason for a revision, they will not want to do it (Also they rarely wan to remove shunts if they are not working anymore). And the reason is that every time they open you up there is a risk of infection and possible malfunction (&gt;90% are in the first six months), so they do not want to make the issue worse/cyclical. Also bodies are adaptable and CSF reabsorbs. Still not fun to think about! Thanks for the info and response. Since the last time anything has happened with it, I was 5 so it is just been so long that I hardly remember anything. Eases my worries a lot. That makes me feel a lot better. Thank you! You will know if you are having a prob and need to go to the hospital (vomiting, headache, dizzy, blurry vision etc) but until then do not worry, you might never need to fix it Those are the symptoms I do vividly remember. I think it is almost impossible to forget those kind of headaches... They are incomparable to anything else. Thanks for your feedback! I have been told that over time, the tubing in shunts are known to get brittle and kindof break partially. It is all normal, as long as you are not actively speeding up the process by like, wiggling it around, which I used to do when I was like 3. Shunts could break at any time, like everything man-made. As for your shunt being broken and working, doctors would want to operate unless you are symptomatic. Thanks for your response and sorry for my late one. It kind of wiggles around on its own.. it is already completely eroded in half. I have about 6-12 inches of tubing still connected to the shunt itself and then 5ish feet from the back of my neck to my abdomen that is no longer connected. I have been feeling discomfort (not pain; it does not really hurt) around the part that is broken and more in my abdomen. It is not painful at all, just not exactly the best feeling in the world. So I guess my main worry is the extra 2.5ish feet that is coiled in my abdomen possible causing issues/ or the other 2 feet from my collarbone area/neck to the bottom of my ribs, retracting and causing issues since there is no longer tension keeping it in place. Thanks for the info and that is basically what the neurologist said/ I somewhat knew. I made a long post to another comment right above yours I believe if you would like to read the whole thing. But the bases of it if you do not want to; is it possible for the broken tubing to cause issues? Like getting wrapped and causing blockage issues in the gut? I also have noticed my balance being worse but not extreme or anything. It is possible for the tubing to cause issues but that is generally quite rare.  I would keep a diary of your symptoms. Memory, balance, headaches and to check for papilledema. I appreciate your reply and input! I was experiencing some soreness around the tube track and minor balance issue for a good little bit. About a few weeks after posting this all the symptoms kind of went away which I am attributing to my body I guess getting used to the tube sliding a little bit. I was experiencing pressure changes in my right ear for a while that was painful just the same as you would experience when changing altitude. Was quite odd considering I was not changing altitudes due to COVID. Feel pretty ok now but I will take your advice if the issues pop back up again! Thank you.", "Shunt causing stomach pains My mother had her shunt operation 4 months ago to treat her hydrocephalus. The operation went well but she is now suffering with constant sharp, stabbing stomach pains.\n\nThe pains are not localised at a specific spot on her abdomen, instead they can occur anywhere but always the abdomen. \n\nDoctors have tested her for many things but now they are saying it could be that she is reacting to the antibiotics which cost the tube that runs from her shunt to her stomach. They have said that they can replace the tube with an older style tube which does not have antibiotics on it but obviously that means she will be more prone to infections.\n\nHas anyone else suffered with stomach pains similar to this after their shunt operation? Or does anyone have possible advice that I could give her? \n\nRunning out of options and I would not want her to have to go through another op to replace the tube and then possibly get an infection. She is 76. 1 month in from my first revision currently. I have good days and bad days. Some days it hurts all the way to my back and others it hurts to yawn. I went to the doctor yesterday and was told it was likely scar tissue and it stretch more, massage it and go on walks. We will see if it helps. Hope your mom feels better soon Hi! I had this exact thing! It is the tube and it will take a while to settle but it will. \n\nMine took a few months. It mostly gets caught on my womb which used to make me drop with pain. I still get it a bit now but it is just mildly annoying. It will improve. It is the tube finding the places it can go in her abdomen. Send her my good wishes, I know how she feels. It is the worst! \n\nGentle exercise can help and buscopan (it is a muscle relaxant designed for IBS) She might find it is worse after eating. The stomach contracts and relaxes and the movement causes the tube to move. Hence the additional pain. \n\nHope this helps! If you are in the states then find a muscle relaxant for IBS but check it is not a laxative too. You do not want that! That will do the opposite as there will be even more movement in there! Thanks so much, I knew someone else out there would be having the same problem. God bless Reddit \ud83d\ude02\n\nWe are in the UK but I am sure we can find something similar. \n\nThanks again Oh the UK! Fab! Grab Buscopan. Works a treat! \ud83d\ude0a Hi again, having spoken to my mum she told me she cannot have Buscopan as she has taken it before and it caused her to faint. Is there anything else you can recommend? Thanks for the info though, it has started to ease up and is definitely getting better so I think what you have said is right, hopefully over time it will get better. \n\nThanks Hi! I think the best thing is for her to speak to her GP and ask what they would recommend. It is basically anything used to relax the stomach muscles so they stop clenching so much. \n\nIn terms of more natural solutions\u2026 things like Rennies might help, or mint tea, or mints actually. Smaller, more regular portions may also help. It gives the stomach less to deal with. On bad days I avoid things like caffeine too. The doctor should be able to recommend something though.\n\nHopefully it will calm down a lot more and she will not need anything at all! In the meantime though, hopefully the above will help! \ud83d\ude0a Oh and also, gently jumping up and down on the spot can make it move out of painful positions too! Just covering all the bases here. Fantastic thanks for the advice! I will pass the tips on and hopefully it will help. Yes she spoke to gp but they have been unable to pin point it, they even talked about operating again and replacing the tube but I think she should avoid that as i could not imagine her going though the operation again! \n\nSounds to me like it is just the tube settling in the body", "FMLA/voluntary sick leave Anyone here need FMLA or voluntary sick leave for your hydro? Either for shunt replacement or  severe constant headache/recovery? And how did your supervisor/manager react to it? \n\nAlso how do they react if you need to take PTO for neurosurgery/neurology/ophthalmology etc. checkups? We tend to require these more than the general population so it is tough. (And you put in your PTO request on time etc.)", "New to this Hi everyone,\n\n\nHere is some background, I am a 27 y/o female, mixed Native American and White. I live in the Southern US (but I am from the Midwest)\n\n\nAfter four years of being sick, a cholecystectomy, and two misdiagnosis, my current GI specialist did an MRI on my brain and it showed mild hydrocephalus. We went over the results on the 18th and a referral to a neurologist was sent. \n\n\nI am honestly not sure how I have hydrocephalus, I have never had a head injury-there are no signs or tumors,hemorrhages, or meningitis. I have never had an MRI done on my brain before. So it is hard for me to say if I have had this my entire life, or if it started recently, or if it was the problem originally 4 years ago. I would like to hope that my faulty gallbladder was the reason for being originally sick. Because I felt better for like 3 months after surgery and then I was back to being sick again. I did somehow contract C.Diff. During that surgery-was treated but still sick after treatment for the c.diff. \n\n\nI have some symptoms that I am not sure if anyone else experiences, I am honestly really scared. I have some anxiety when it comes to \u201chead things\u201d.  But here are my symptoms \n\n-weight loss (I was 140lbs at my heaviest and now I am down to 112.8lbs I am 5ft 6.25in).\n\n-nausea and vomiting, poor appetite and stomach pains. \n\n-lethargic/exhausted all the time. Sometimes it feels like my legs have weights. \n\n- I get moments of where my vision will fade from my peripherals to the center of my vision-then I lose it for like 5 seconds. This usually happens when I take the stairs and while delayed-after I get up from sitting down. I say delayed because I could be 10-15 feet from where I was sitting before it starts to affect me. However, when this happens my body becomes very weak and my arms and legs will become shaky. (I thought this may be low blood pressure? But the GI specialist said it sounded neurological).\n\n-hand tremors. My hands shake slightly. \n\n-malnutrition and fat malabsorption (I have low vitamin K on and off)\n\n-memory issues and sometimes I feel like my brain has \u201cinternet explorer\u201d moments where it is like I need time to process what was just said.\n\n-I get dizzy and have fallen a couple of times. \n\n\nThis is all that I can remember at this time. Does anyone else have symptoms like this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! Excuse my formatting, I wrote this from my phone. Hey there! I am sorry it took them so long to diagnose you. \n\nI am from London but my story is kind of similar, it took them 8/9 months to diagnose me. Like you, I experienced momentary vision loss, dizziness, lethargy, memory loss &amp; severe nausea. I also experienced constant ringing/ murmuring in my ears, a feeling of fullness in both my ears, intense pressure behind my eyes &amp; the most ridiculous high pressure headaches. \n\nI was initially treated with an ETV but that failed, so I was shunted (along with many other things). Like you also, there was no explanation for my hydrocephalus - I had not suffered any head trauma &amp; I was not sick - so who knows where the hell it came from. \n\nMy advice to you is to try your best to not worry about it - especially once you get treated (I know, definitely easier said than done.) When I first got shunted, all I could think about was it failing and me potentially having to go back into hospital and have more operations, scans etc. But that really is no way to live. And thankfully, the condition is treatable and you can go on to live an amazing life. Accept it for what it is and never ever stop living your life and giving in to the panic. \n\nBest of luck on your journey!! \u2764\ufe0f I had the vision stuff and had to go to the bathroom alot. I also had no tumor or hemorrhage or anything like that. 26. Let me know if you have any other questions  This all sounds quite familiar. I also include constant headache, feeling off balance. How is your gait?\n\nI have been struggling lately, and just had my shunt adjusted today. \n\nOne strange (for me) thing about this kind of injury is that I lack any way to describe it, even to myself.  All other forms of injury that I am familiar with are of a set of objects. Things like a cold or a leg injury are attributable to certain body parts or processes. Hydrocephalus is related to everything, or nothing? It is nebulous to me. How do you describe it in writing? \n\nEvery time I have needed a shunt revision, I spent months leading up to it berating myself for mistakes, with no way to even describe to myself or others that \u201csomething\u201d is wrong. I described it recently as all the bad parts of being drunk. \n\nMy point is this: I am so sorry. The relief from a shunt is huge for me, and I hope it is for you. Get a second opinion, since it is not a minor surgery. \n\nThe radiologist should be able to give you a copy of that mri. If you can, get it, back it up some place. This is a baseline. At least make sure your doctor has a copy. \n\nAny changes they want to track can now be compared to that scan. Even years down the road. \n\nBest of luck to you, internet stranger. If I can answer any questions or help in some way, please get in touch! No question is too dumb. Happy to listen if that helps too. I was recently diagnosed with hydrocephalus although I am lot older, 56. Like you I do not know why I have this which is not that uncommon. They call it idiopathic hydrocephalus. It is scary, especially the surgery which will be my first outside of having my wisdom teeth removed at 18. I thought I had Alzheimer\u2019s so I am relieved that this is treatable. I have memory problems, headaches, pressure in my ears, balance problems, and go to the bathroom all the time. I am seeing a second neurosurgeon next week and am actually looking forward to surgery but I am scared of having a chronic health condition. Feel free to reach out and good luck to you. I am so glad to see I am not alone. This has all been so scary and I have been way more conscious of my symptoms now that I know this. It is comforting to see that you and many others experienced the same momentary loss of vision like myself, and are still able to see today. My biggest worry was going blind from this. I had my eyes checked November 2020, and they did a routine pressure check and that came back normal. But even with that reminder in the back of my mind I am nervous. I have not had my gait measured. I have not seen a neurologist yet either. This was discovered by my GI specialist when they did an MRI on my brain, and the results were reviewed this past Wednesday. He put in a referral but I have not heard from the referral yet to make an appointment. I plan to reach out tomorrow if I do not hear anything by morning time. Thank you so much for your reply. I can definitely understand what you mean by there is something wrong but it is hard to describe.\nI have had memory issues that I kept justifying as my ADHD. I allowed myself to trust my previous GI specialist and went with her gut originally that my neurological symptoms were just from malnutrition due to me going through fat malabsorption on and off. I chalked up any irritability I had to being justified for reasons x,y,z. \nBut I also had issues over time remembering what I was like before getting sick to even know if some of these symptoms were normal or not lol. It is been a roller coaster these last four years. \nWith my luck with specialists I have been trying to be a bit more on top of things now and I am going to be picky about this neurologist -I do not just want anyone to do brain surgery on me if needed. It is just hard when you are not sure or what sounds right/wrong. Hello!  I know it is all very scary right now.  I am sure it is due to the fear of the unknown.  I had my shunt inserted when I was 28 days old and I turn 48 years old in 2 weeks, so I have had hydrocephalus my entire life.  I had my shunt replaced in 2017 after it malfunctioned.  As odd as it sounds, neuro/brain surgery does not scare me as much as other surgeries.  If you have a neurosurgeon who is up front and explains everything, it definitely helps.  If they confirm it is hydrocephalus and you have a shunt installed you will hopefully feel and see immediate  improvement  in your quality of life.   Keep us posted! Hi there, was just hoping to check in and see how you are going? \n\nMy younger brother is 18 and was diagnosed yesterday. All he had was 4 episodes over a 3 month period of random extreme head pain and vomiting. Doctors thought it was just migraines and then my Mum requested an MRI to rule out anything else. Dr said it was not necessary but they were happy to oblige for peace of mind - lucky they did.. now we are in the land of the unknown and like you, have no idea what, how or when this was caused. He also has never had an MRI before now. Hey! I am glad your mom pushed for the MRI. I saw the neurologist September 9th, and she did not seem too concerned (I was shaking like a leaf from anxiety) just found it odd they could not see a direct cause. So I am being referred to a neurosurgeon to overlook the actual MRI imaging. Then we plan to go from there. The neurologist stressed that just because I am going to a neurosurgeon does not necessarily mean I will need surgery. She mentioned that with her older patients they can do spinal taps to release that excess fluid. So that was reassuring because I have a fear of medical stuff relating to the head (I blame the SAW movies for that lol). So not much more information as of yet, I do have to get a balance and vision test done this week with the neurologist to rule out vertigo and REM for being any cause of dizziness I get. But she did suspect that my memory issues and vomiting were most likely a symptom from the mild hydrocephalus I have. \nI cannot imagine the headaches everyone describes because I do not experience those (another odd thing because that is usually one of the first symptoms from what I was told). But from what I have gathered they are very painful. I am sending strength to your family and brother. I know it can be scary, I was terrified when I got the results, but after seeing the neurologist I have calmed down significantly. Oh I am so glad they do not seem too concerned and it is great that they are doing the additional tests. I hope for your sake that surgery is not required. I can appreciate being fearful of that and can see how those movies did it to you!\n\nHopefully the vision and balance tests come back good for you too \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc. \n\nWe were told today that my brother will definitely need surgery and that will be on Monday (he is currently in hospital). Hoping it all goes well. Appreciate your kind wishes \u2665\ufe0f I hope the surgery goes well! I have a bit of an update, I guess I have to get a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) before the neurosurgeon will see me. So it is been a lot of phone tag yesterday and this morning. Did your brother have a spinal tap done? Oh that is frustrating. The back and forth and waiting kills it. \n\nNo he has not had a spinal tap done at all. They have confirmed that the hydrocephalus is being caused by aqueduct stenosis through \u201cslice\u201d MRI.. they also did eye tests and confirmed he has grade 3 papilledema (optic disc swelling caused by additional intracranial pressure - in this case the excess fluid in his brain). They basically said they cannot wait or leave it because if they do, he could go blind any day. \n\nWhat are they hoping to achieve from the spinal tap? Do they think they can drain your fluid that way? Or are they just checking pressure?", "TBF to about 5 years ago after a shunt replacement (Attached is a photo of me post op)  Thanks for posting.   It is been so long since my last surgery, do you know why they operate towards the front of your head, is this to insert the shunt further into the brain? \n\nAwesome pic. Hope you heal well my friend Oh I am healed, this was five years ago. And they put it there because that is the site of a surgery prior, so there is less scar tissue formed. This was to replace a shunt that was 13-15 years old, I cannot remember the exact age Oh I am healed, this was five years ago. And they put it there because that is the site of a surgery prior, so there is less scar tissue formed. This was to replace a shunt that was 13-15 years old, I cannot remember the exact age They put my shunt on the upper right side of my head because of the shape of my skull. I think its placed for different reasons. Cool. I have had my original shunt for 27 years..\nWhat was the reason/symptoms you had to have your original shunt replaced? I had outgrown mine. I got it put in when I was 2 months old. It was starting to hurt, became red and tender, and was actually pulling down on my head, making me have a head tilt akin to a curious puppy. Curious..did the Dr. say anything about a 3rd endoscopic ventricularostomy? ( do not know if I spelled it right). The last time I saw my original Dr. he said if I had problems that is what he would do. The success rate was only 50/50 at the time. It scared the heck out of me to not be on the good side of that if I had to have it done.", "Are very frequent nose bleeds associated with hydrocephalus ? When my hydrocephalus symptoms were very prominent (severe migraines etc) I also used to get nosebleeds very often. Is it linked to hydrocephalus? As a kid and into my early 20's, I got them constantly. I had them almost everyday for 2 years and then one day they stopped for a little while and came back and only started again cuz my shunt setting had changed by itself.\n\nEdit: I have an Lp shunt Nuero told me nose bleeds can happen if pressure gets too high. Its never happened to me personally.", "Question for fellow short people F17.\n\nSo I am 5\u20191 and I have had a shunt since birth and have never needed an extension (although now I would since it is migrated (no longer in my stomach cavity) but I have been ok for years and it has not caused problems)\n\n\nAnyone around my height or shorter, have you had many or any tube extensions? M 30 5\u20194. I have a VP shunt and my last revision was number 30. The only time I have had to have shunt surgery and it not be an emergency was when I was 15 and they decided to schedule to have the tube lengthened in my abdomen. M35 4'10, never had a revision. I am 4\u20189\u201c and my father was in the military. I have had my shunt all my life. So, before we were stationed overseas I had surgery to have my tubing lengthened. Ironically and somewhat humorously, I have enough tubing to grow to be 7 foot tall with no issues. LOL considering I am 48 years old and I am not going to be growing anymore, I think I am set for life. LOL Yup! I am 5\u20192\u201d and when my first shunt failed when I was 3 months old, they revised it and placed an adult shunt with lots of extra coils of tubing, which would safely unravel as I grew. I started having issues when I was 15 and imaging showed I still had a lot of extra tubing left. Had another revision at 16 and they sort of fitted the tubing to my current height because I would stopped growing. 5\u20192 had it lengthen around 4y/o but not again after that I had my shunt lengthened at age 2. I ended up being 5' 3.", "Is it possible to hydrocephalus without gait or incontinence problems? Background: ~30f, probable craniocervical instability, hypermobility. I had a MAJOR migraine last year that lasted five days and was probably viral meningitis. I did not go to the hospital for stupid and regrettable reasons but I am still having problems that should have resolved by now. My primary physician deduced that it was viral meningitis and none of my imaging has shown otherwise (ct's, mri, mra- I have a tiny cerebral outpouching but no evidence of a hemorrhage of any kind).\n\nSymptoms: horrible cognitive \"deficits\". I functioned normally on a neuropsych exam but my personality has changed and I do not feel the same physically or mentally as I did before my migraine. I am more impulsive and have less of a filter. Constant sensation of dullness and dumbness unlike anything I have experienced before. \"Cranial\" nausea and a sense of high pressure in my head/brain. Unbearable sense of being inflamed in my head, to the point where I am surprised I can communicate properly sometimes. This has been highly noticeable for the past month and a half but present since the presumptive meningitis last year. It seems to come and go throughout the day but never goes away. Alcohol effects me strongly and weed/cbd make me highly aware of the pressure sensation and increases the sense of cognitive deficit dramatically. I am barely drinking and smoking at the moment because of this. Drowsiness, mental malaise. The pressure feels like how people describe rebound intracranial pressure problems.\n\nSymptoms I do not have: major balance problems (I have minor moments where I kind of tip over due to hypermobility), major gait problems, incontinence.\n\nI feel generally dazed and am unable to focus on anything. My behavior has changed a bit to the point where my relationships are suffering as a result. I have had concussions in the past but the meningitis* seemed to be the cognitive straw on the camel's back. My thought is that I may have developed some form of hydrocephalus during the meningitis? It is possible that my brain was damaged during the ordeal but I really do not feel as if the physical issues have completely resolved.\n\nIs it possible to have hydrocephalus without having the major outward symptoms? I have many of the other symptoms and I know it is possible to develop hydrocephalus as a result of infection. I plan on scheduling another appointment with my neurologist but I would like to have more information on this first. Umm, yes. You can have hydrocephalus without being incontinent. \n\nSauce: the only time I was incontinent with hydrocephalus coincided with being a baby, but I am pretty sure that is normal since pretty much all babies wear diapers, so I am fairly certain it is a baby thing and not a hydrocephalus thing. Not trying to be rude, but like, I am just really confused on the whole idea that this is a required symptom, it really threw me for a loop. They would be able to see hydrocephalus on any of the brain imaging you did.  So, did they? It is not hydrocephalus if they did not see it.  Hydrocephalus is pretty evident by a radiologist.  Have you had hydrocephalus before? \n\nAnd you said you had a neuropsych eval? So you tested for adhd? Have you seen a craniosacral specialist about your neck? Im not really sure what hyper mobility would look like, but the meningitis caused this?  Did you already look into long term cognitive effects from meningitis? \n\nI would definitely stop drinking and smoking for the time being.  They will in no way help your mental agility. Okay, thanks for that. These symptoms are frustrating because I do not present with hallmark features. Do any of the other symptoms sound familiar to you? It sounds like you may have been diagnosed as a child. The major symptoms are listed as hair disturbance, dementia, bladder control problems. Nobody mentioned it in my follow ups. Never had hydrocephalus before.\n\nI have had the neuropsych eval. Adhd has nothing to do with the majority of these symptoms. The craniocervical stuff is most likely irrelevant as well in regards to the sensations of pressure and nausea. I am aware of the cognitive effects of meningitis as written in the post itself.\n\nThe substance use was addressed in the post as well.\n\nThe only useful part of your response were the first and third lines, but thanks anyways. I had hydrocephalus as a kid, got a shunt, was fine for a while. \n\nAs an adult, I had a little minor calcified shunt chunk removal surgery, an ETV, then after that never felt the same until a year and a half after when it got really bad. It turns out I was introduced to some critters after/during the surgery, and my immune system just kept it at bay for a while until it could not anymore, and then I started really puking and not doing well. That is when they figured out I had meningitis (bacterial, so honestly the easier kind). It took like a year and a half to get bad enough that I stopped being able to communicate and people really started noticing, but before that, people apparently just thought I had started huffing glue or something I guess. \n\nNow 2.5 years after that I have worse ADHD but I am mostly healed or at least compensating. I know what you mean in part in a cognitive way. Some people say you should acknowledge new deficits, but I have had better luck myself--after healing for like 2 years at least--that at this point there might be some loss of executive function, but I am still me. I am messy, but I am me. I am short(er) tempered, but I am me. I am not exactly grad school material (yet) but I am still smart (but certainly less confident), and I am still me.\n\n\nI am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, but, if you were my kid or my parent, I would take you in for looking at low pressure hydrocephalus, but even more importantly, I would get you a lumbar puncture.\n\nThey really suck, make sure you have someone to drive you if you can, and if you can, get them to knock you out. \n\nI would want them to check the pressure obviously, but after that, get a culture. I would not be surprised if you were still sick. \n\nApparently some meningitis can be like walking pneumonia, life is okay, you are kind of okay, but it just really, really, really sucks. I had a TA for a class tell me about his friend who had chronic meningitis, and he was not a doctor either, but apparently it is a thing.\n\nI am sorry you are going through this. Know that if you are not still sick, you are healing every day. You *may not* be the same person, but you *are* still you, whomever that might be. Also, regardless of what happens, who is to say you would be the \"same\" person from one year to a next anyway? It definitely is, as hydrocephalus is very variable. I have had none of these symptoms and I am 27, diagnosed at like 3months old. I have been very lucky and only had one shunt revision, and one major bacterial infection. My only noticeable change post revision (at 14yo) was some sensory changes, specifically that certain things began to register as pain like the sensation of tickling and being too cold. Get a spinal tap and look for low pressure hydrocephalus, but if none of any of this was seen on imaging it may be something else. I am sorry you are going through this:( Thank you for sharing, I really appreciate it. I am a 24F from London and was diagnosed with hydrocephalus last August after experiencing symptoms for 8/9 months prior to diagnosis (could be congenital, could also have developed after a car accident - my consultant is not sure.) I did not experience any gait or incontinence issues - only really intense high pressure headaches, vision problems, nausea, brain fog and extreme tinnitus. So to answer your question, yes it is possible to have hydrocephalus without gait or incontinence problems. Wishing you all the best going forward! Hahahaha okay! What exactly were you looking tor then?\n\nEdited to add: \n&gt; more impulsive and less of a filter\n&gt; constant sensation of dullness and dumbness \n&gt; drowsiness, mental malaise\n&gt; I feel generally dazed and am unable to focus\n\nThese are common feelings or signs in ADHD You really seem to be cherry picking here.\n\n&gt;Constant sensation of dullness and dumbness unlike anything I have experienced before. \"Cranial\" nausea and a sense of high pressure in my head/brain. Unbearable sense of being inflamed in my head, to the point where I am surprised I can communicate properly sometimes.\n\nSide note- dullness in a physical sense.\n\nDoes this sound like ADHD to you? Combined with the fact that you know I experienced what was essentially a non-traumatic brain injury?\n\nAlso, changes in personality, dementia, confusion, and disorientation are symptoms of hydrocephalus and meningitis themselves. I would argue that problems with CSF or the meninges cause deleriousness (sp) or inability to focus as opposed to the contrary.\n\nI understand if you do not recognize my symptoms as analogous with your understanding of hydrocephalus, but I think I made it very clear that these symptoms are likely the result of physical, tangible problems. Just because it may not be hydrocephalus does not mean it is adhd. Get real. Sorry,  it was just a thought.  Im glad you do not have ADHD. I hope it is not hydrocephalus, but if it is I hope they find it! Good luck! I would say yes and that everyone is different. My dad (65 yrs old) also has hydrocephalus but he never had headaches (before his shunt surgery). He is one week post op and now says he has headaches for obvious reasons. But I always read many people had bad headaches but my dad never ever did. So for you to not have gait and incontinence problems, I would say it is possible. Were your CT/MRI scans recently done? Definitely a good idea to schedule appointment to see a doc soon. Sorry you are going through this. Hope you get some clarifications soon. This subreddit is amazing and I have learned a lot from everyone. Take care. Thank you. that is for normal pressure hydrocephalus, a specific sub-condition. those are not the only symptoms of hydrocephalus. I am glad you posted this. I am curious of the same because I suffer from terrible cognitive difficulties and other symptoms such as bladder control. I also have become invested in upper cervical care since I have gotten some cognitive relief when done right. This corresponds to the upper cervical reasoning of removing blockage to allow CSF to drain properly. Unfortunately I have not been able to keep the benefits for long stretches of time after each treatment. \nI have been looking up chronic, mild cases of hydrocephalus and it is hard to find any that are not severe to the extend that a shunt procedure had been performed as a child or as a senior.\nI have had mental slowness for life, which occasional windows of normalcy/sharpness, but it has seemingly gotten worse in recent years (31M). \nIt would be nice to get a definitive answer somewhere, despite the fact that I have never been diagnosed despite the CT scans and MRIs I have had of my brain over the years. I wonder if it should have come up then or if it could be harder to detect with those scans when not specifically looking for it.", "Abdominal and neck pain after eating Hi! I am 32F with bilateral VP shunts since birth. I have only had one revision, and was told last year that my hydrocephalus had seemed to have resolved itself because my hardware was no longer in the right places (migrated from ventricles I guess). \n\nFor the past ~8 months I have been having severe abdominal and neck pain after eating. \n\nIt is resolved with ibuprofen, so I am assuming there is inflammation somewhere. While my next step is to check in with neurosurgery, I wanted to see if anyone has had this happen to them.", "Has anyone here dealt with shunt infection? I had a new shunt put in 10 days ago. Since my surgery I have felt a wet / dripping feeling coming from my upper incision. I saw a neurosurgeon and he said it is likely the antiseptic dripping down, he made sure there was no noticeable leak. I showered a couple times hoping it was just antiseptic that would come off, but I still have the feeling. I do not have a fever, no redness, swelling, etc. just the odd feeling. I have spoken to 5-6 people from neurosurgery who have basically told me the discharge would be noticeable and even if it was not, I would have more symptoms if it were truly leaking. I of course now worry that I have shunt infection. My temp is not high, it is only 98.6-98.8. I have no redness, etc. has anyone dealt with infection, does it sound like it? I am hoping it is just my nerves acting weird around the area since they were recently cut open. my neurosurgeon team does not seem too concerned, so I trust them and will go in if I develop more symptoms. Until then, can anyone relate? I have had about 6 revisions in my life so far man. I am 21, I have never experienced anything like that. Mine is a VP shunt, so it might be different, but no matter. \n\nIf you believe it is infected, go to your neurologist/surgeon, that is the best thing to do. I would not risk a chance of an infection. \n\nHowever, my last revision was about 5 years ago, so I do not remember much from mine, perhaps I had fluid leak too and just do not remember. \n\nKeep me updated :) I had a staphylococcus infection in my spinal fluid following a revision 20 years ago. I basically had very similar symptoms a few weeks post revision that I did before hand (bad headaches,, light sensitive, trouble holding food down). I do not remember a fever, but it is been a long time. It took a long time a a full replacement, but they got it done.\n\nHang in there, listen to your body and do not give up trying! I have had 2 shunt infections and have had an actual leak in my shunt. From my experience, if you have an actual leak coming through your incision, there will be no question. When my leak was discovered, I had CSF coming through the incision and dripping on the floor. \n\nConcerning infection, I had a temp of 102 and redness and swelling at the shunt site, both times my shunt was infected.\n\nI have noticed through the years that the skin flap covering the shunt just feels weird. Sometimes it tingles, sometimes it itches, and sometimes it just feels sore. I have been told that this is normal and caused by nerve damage in the scalp. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask! Yes, I have and you need call the Neurosurgeon ASAP....My infection was serious and it was caught 72 hours after I was released. The shunt had to be redone of course and I was hospitalized for 8 days for IV antibiotics DESPITE the fact I am an RN...LOL...nothing worse than being told you cannot do IV antibiotics at home with a nurse coming in or at least letting you do your own IV's etc. I just talked to my daughters neurosurgeon yesterday about infection. The degree of your fever is not indicative of anything really. Ie you could have a low fever and an infection or a high fever with an infection. Your odds of an infection are also highest after surgery. I had a  programmable shunt inserted  in May. Within 10 days of fitting I had serious stomache pain and bad diarrea. Blood test showed an infection so had the shunt externalised and a external drain refitted to try and prevent it reaching my brain. The infection caused a pool of puss like stuff in my stomache,  had my appendix removed ( it was sat in it) and nasty stuff pumped out. Sample of my csf from the drain showed infection had reached my brain so was on iv antibiotics for several weeks nd shunt fully removed.\nMy main symptom was the stomach pain, and diarrea. at that stage I was still getting headaches and light sensitivity. Without a blood test or csf sample it may be hard to conclusively tell but push your Dr to get it done so you do not end up having to start from square 1 again. Mine was a staphylococcal infection.", "Biking I am an avid cyclist and recently had a revision to my shunt that replaced all of the tubing and the valve.  I am not sure if the new tubing is thicker or what but I have found that my helmet is more prone to limiting or cutting off the flow of CSF through the tubing.  Has anyone else encountered this issue?  Have you found a helmet that works well for you? What kind of symptoms do you have while wearing the helmet? Do they go away as soon as you remove the helmet?\n Well after just a few miles I start to notice a mild headache and when I take off my helmet my ears pop a lot. Well after just a few miles I start to notice a mild headache and when I take off my helmet my ears pop a lot. I know that I tend to get a headache and generally feel uncomfortable when I have something tight on my head. I have been told that this is from scar tissue. As far as the helmet compressing your shunt tubing, the tubing is fairly stiff going from the burr hole to the valve, so I do not think that the helmet would put enough pressure on it to actually occlude it. Just offering my experience, a call to your neurosurgeon could get you a definitive answer. How long ago was the op? Could it be swollen still?  Beginning of December.  That is what I had thought originally but out definitely seems like the actual tubing is larger this time around.", "Heart beat in ear? I am 14(going to be 15 in august)and have had my shunt for 14 1/2 years (spina bifida) I have had pain in what my doctor called my \u201cmastoid bone\u201d and in my neck but said nothing was wrong. Anyway does anyone have a shunt and a almost lumpy bone behind your ear? Also has anyone ever heard a heart beat in your adjacent ear from the shunt? I do not have a shunt but I too, hear my heartbeat and a strange static kind of noise when I stand up or may down from the opposite position. It only lasts for a short time but I attribute it to an inner ear infection/ inblaslmbcew, or for you, maybe an irritation from the shunt and tubing? I am going with irritation of the tube it is going on 15 years old I just think I got lucky it lasted 14 years Yeah, that is probably all it is! Mine is 18 years old and I will sometimes have pain but it is easy to tell that it is tube irritation from being covered in scar tissue and also against the skin. If there was something seriously wrong, you would likely have neurological symptoms.\n\nIbuprofen and Tylenol usually helps me :) I have a shunt, and that heartbeat in your ear is your pulse.  Find a way to position your pillow so your ear is not smothered by pillow/causing you to to feel pulse...I recall visiting my doctor for this very reason, that was over 20 years. ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRe pain\n\nWhat is your pain level?  is it 5/10, 8/10, worse? I have a big bump behind my ear that is really painful, especially when I stand up or try to move it really hurts, like a stinging kind of pain. I had that at first but now it is a little bit above my bump and behind my ear It is like a 5 at most it is not like a pain that will keep my from doing my usual things everyday it is just kind of there it is enough to be irritating but it does not stop me from my usual day Ok.  My thoughts are that this could pass with time. I had a similar issue and while it never completely went away, it did reduce over time. \n\nPerpective is very important, always balance how lucky you are given your medical condition VS the pain you feel.  I am not suggesting you suffer and not address your pain, rather the sooner you can accept it as is the better off your will be. It is 2020, and doctors still put a rubber tube in our bodies as a solution to drain fluid..this is old-school but the best known solution for our conditions.  \n\nDoes this help? I mean it does not make it worse! It started right before I started my freshman year and I was really stressed at the time and still an but I have been trying to take it easier and ironically since I have been taking it easy i have not had pain in 3 days", "My dad's getting VP shunt followed by radiation therapy. Hello all from Canada!\n\nI just wanted to ask what was your recovery like after you had the VP shunt surgery? I know everyone is different and can have different side effects/recovery rates. I was told after surgery my dad will most likely be in recovery at hospital for 3-5 days. My mind is racing for my dad. He is 63 years old. I am worried, scared and stressed. I have been reading that it has a high success rate and it is a common procedure. I was told the shunt stays in there forever and surgery only happens again if something happens like if a blockage occurs.\n\nAlso, did anyone have radiation therapy afterwards? If so, how are you doing now? \n\nThis will be my dad's second surgery. He had one in 2016 to remove a tumor but it unfortunately grew back which is now causing the hydrocephalus. The first surgery was done by entrance through his nasal cavity (that blew my mind!). So this VP shunt sounds a bit terrifying for us. I appreciate you all for reading this. Thank you. I am not a doctor, but I am guessing this is not simply hydrocephalus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you Dad has cancer and the tumor is interfering with how cerebral spinal fluid moves through the brain. So yes, that is hydrocephalus, but caused by a cancerous tumor.\n\nAgain, I am not a doctor, but maybe you might want to question your Dad a bit more on what is actually going on. Encourage him to be honest. I thought hydrocephalus is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) buildup in the brain? So hydrocephalus can be caused by many other things then, not just a tumor? (Sorry, I am learning as I do more research). \n\nThe tumor is causing enlargement in areas of his brain which also has the buildup of CSF . So doctors recommended to get the VP shunt to drain the fluid followed by radiation to shrink the tumor. We also know that tumor is benign.\n\nI guess I was looking for feedback from patients or people that know someone that had a shunt since this is his first ever shunt surgery. &gt;Encourage him to be honest.\n\nThis has been hard the past 24 hours, to get him to be honest and tell us how he is really feeling. We told him it is okay to feel worried or scared and to remember we are in the hands of good doctors. Hopefully he will speak more in a couple days, just giving him time. I cannot imagine what is running through his mind. :(  I had a VP shunt fitted 3 years ago to manage build up of CSF caused by a benign tumour. I will try and share some things I think may be helpful: \n\n- i was in hospital probably only for 2 days after surgery and then they let me home.\n- I took 3 weeks off work, so I suppose that is how long it took until i felt able to do everything that i previously did.\n- my shunt is programmable. You should ask your dad/his surgeons whether he is getting a programmable shunt. This means that they can change the suction levels really quickly without further surgery. For example, when I woke up after my surgery, I basically just had the worst headache and nausea and spent the entire first night vomiting every half hour or so. It felt like the world\u2019s worst hangover. This is because the shunt was **overdraining**, dehydrating the brain. The nurses reported this to the doctors in the morning and they came to my bedside, put this weird magnet compass thingy against my head, turned it, and changed the suction to a different level. I felt fine ever since. \n- for my shunt they made two incisions. One in my skull (obviously) and one in my abdomen. The abdomen incision is because when the shunt drains the CSF fluid it takes it to the stomach basically to get digested. For me, the abdomen cut was just so uncomfortable. It made it difficult to sit up, to stand up, to walk. Basically any bending or straining was really painful at first.\n- as I was recovering (probably over the 6 months after surgery or maybe longer), I would occasionally get a pang in my abdomen, that kind of felt like the pain you get when you have done too much running and you are out of breath. Here we call it a \u2018stitch\u2019 but it is not to do with an actual stitch like you might have for a scar. It is basically a sharp stinging pain usually in your lungs. I would get \u2018a stitch\u2019 semi regularly in my abdomen. I checked with my surgeon and he said it is completely normal, it is just the shunt touching a nerve.\n- early days after surgery sleeping was really hard. It was just so uncomfortable with the shunt down my neck. It felt to me like I was trying to fall asleep lying on top of a biro pen. I remember crying thinking I would never get comfortable in bed again. Do not worry, once the internal bruising goes down, you stop feeling it. You will be comfy again :)\n- for me, my shunt did get blocked 1 year after insertion. I do not think my doctors were super clear with me on this point, but shunts have a really high failure rate. 64% fail in the first 6 months. My symptoms for failure were similar to symptoms for the hydrocephalus. Headaches, nausea, double vision. I eventually had a TIA which is a transient ischemic attack (stroke). Do not ignore these symptoms (obviously I did not ignore the stroke haha but it did not need to get that far). \n\nThat is all I can think of at the moment for things I would want to know beforehand. I have not had radiotherapy so cannot comment on that I am afraid. Sending the best of luck to you and your Dad :) and do be reassured, it is a very common straightforward procedure. It is still considered hydrocephalus, it is just that the way his dad developed it was different than what you think. Hydrocephalus is the \u201caccumulation of fluid inside of the brain\u201d. So by definition, his dad meets this definition. Some people, after having a tumor removed, will develop Hydrocephalus due to the change in the structure of the brain. By removing a piece of the brain, the way the fluid circulates and drains out of the skull has changed and it now can not drain like it was before the development of the tumor. When the tumor is growing back, it can also block the flow of CSF and the buildup occurs, so to solve this, a shunt is put in to drain the fluid that can not naturally flow. This makes sense. Thanks for your reply! Wow, thank you so much for this detailed replied. I appreciate it so much!! Yes, definitely do not ignore the symptoms. This is why I tell my dad if he ever feels different or something is getting worse, he has to let me know so we can tell the doctors. I feel like I have a much better understanding from the patients point of view. Thank you again. I hope all is well with you! Bless your heart. \u2764\ufe0f Take care. No worries! Message me anytime if you have any more shunt questions :)\n\nI am doing well thank you, I am 2 years post my last surgery and completely back to normal in all aspects of my life :) I have had a shunt all of my life for a cyst that is in the back of my brain. Same as with your dad, it inhibits my body from regulating CSF in my brain and the the shunt corrects the inter-cranial pressure by regulating the fluid.\n\nShunts are amazing medical marvels and for most people, correct the issue of hydrocephalus without much supervision or follow-up complications.\n\nI recently had a revision on mine; the programmable shunts are the way to go. They can be reprogrammed at the doctor with a small magnet without much effort if the flow needs to be adjusted.\n\nHe should be fine with the shunt! Hope all goes well. I will ask if my dad's getting a programmable shunt. The more I hear about everyone is surgeries and experiences, the more amazed I am! It is so crazy to know that a device can be inside our heads and programmable to regulate the CSF. Unbelievable! Thank you so much for your reassuring reply. \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Had a vp shunt fitted may 2019 to manage hydrocephalus causes by a benign tumour. After thet removed part of the tumour I was still overproducing csf so needed a shunt.\n\nAn initial complication for me was an infection ( quite rare) so had it removed and replaced a few weeks later. \n\nThe shunt placement can cause different initial side effects, my replacement shunt was put on my left side so for a few days I could not always find the word I wanted e.g saying cat instead of table but fine few days later. I cannot sleep on my shunt side. My stomache scars are quite prominent but I am very pale. \n\nHowever, it is also meant that with a cyst growing now, I have not felt the impact as the shunt has helped to manage the symptoms. \n\nGood luck Shunts have been around since the 70s I believe. The technology has not really changed. They are pretty much one way valves that redirect excess spinal fluid from the cranium to somewhere else. A vp shunt feeds into the abdominal cavity. CSF or cerebrospinal fluid is pretty much blood minus the red blood cells. It circulates all around the brain and spinal cord to protect and nourish them. With hydrocephalus essentially the reabsorption cannot keep up with the production. For being in such a terrifying place the outcome for surgery is actually really good. My daughter had her first surgery when she was a premie and still on respiratory support at around 4 pounds. The procedure itself was pretty quick. I think more time was spent in prep and post than the actual surgery. It was probably between 1-2 hours despite time feeling completely still. \n\nI do not know much about chemo beyond the basics, but I cannot imagine the surgery effecting it really. That is my worry, an infection can occur. I am glad the shunt has helped managed the symptoms from the cyst. Thank you for your reply and stay safe! Your daughter is a trooper. What a strong girl.

New here and excited to find some sort of forum. My son is 5 and had his first shunt placed last May, first revision last week (the valve actually broke and the tubing came disconnected). His doctors are awesome and we are no strangers to the medical field but there is surprisingly few support groups near us, especially when it is just Hydro and not related to multiple other things. \nSince his shunt placement, he is been great. He bounced back from the surgery extremely well (he seems to have a very, very good pain tolerance for some reason) &amp; after his revision last week we have been the ones trying to hold him back from his activity. He had some eye wandering (exotropia) that completely resolved after the shunt but then developed esotropia and now has glasses. Other than that, he very healthy and extremely smart. \nI would be interested to see if any other moms here or younger kids/even adults report any difficulty with attention spans, depth perception, clumsiness, general quirkiness or difficult behaviors...we have been looking for support from someone regarding all this and finally found an OT that says she thinks he has Sensory Integration Disorder which I will admit sounds a bit made up but research shows me he fits a lot of this pretty well...still I wonder if his behaviors are a direct result of his hydro and the way his brain functions now.\n\nAnyways, I am just glad to find this subreddit and hope more people discover and start posting!", "Calcified VP Shunt for 4 years- Advice pls Hi Guys,\n\nSo i have had a VP shunt since birth (precautionary) and luckily i have never needed it replaced (F25). I have had a few scares when I would have pain and rush to the neuro to get it checked. Each time he told me everything was fine. 3 years ago I had an MRI done and he said that my shunt looked great but my tube broke and calcified. So technically, my shunt has not worked for 3 years. He thinks I do not need it and has been wanting to take it out. I would rather keep it since I dislike surgery and it does not bother me too much. For the past 3 days though, The back of my head where the shunt is placed has been aching. As well as a tightness in my neck where the tube runs down. The back of my head aches when I move my neck, neck tightness and shoulder aches and tightness. I am just worried now because i am moving countries in 2 days and i am not sure if this is muscle related or if my shunt is irritated or worse. Do you guys have any thoughts/ similar experiences? Hi, please find the link to the article below.  Now I am no expert in this field, but I am a chemical engineer and we do look at many forms of deposits and fouling in pipes and tubes, so the analogy is there.  From the article, they postulate that because the neck places mechanical stress on the shunt, it has greater susceptibility to calcification fouling, because the bending and turning provides a disruption of flow that can cause nucleation of calcium from the CSF.  The patients described in the paper showed similar symptoms.  I would say if your doctor wants to take it out at this point, it might help with those symptoms, but you are perhaps better asking them if it will fix those symptoms.\n\n( Thanks for your comment! I started getting pain when I suddenly moved my neck at a weird angle and felt a twinge of pain in the back of my head where the shunt is located. I am moving countries in 2 days so I will not be able to see him. I just hope it goes away on its own. My severe hypochondria and anxiety does not help at all. Thanks for your comment! I started getting pain when I suddenly moved my neck at a weird angle and felt a twinge of pain in the back of my head where the shunt is located. I am moving countries in 2 days so I will not be able to see him. I just hope it goes away on its own. My severe hypochondria and anxiety does not help at all. Well I would say if he was so casual about wanting the surgery as you described, it is probably optional as you would have been kept in otherwise!  Have a good move!  Hope it all goes well! Mine is calcified too, mostly in the chest area. It bothers me, but as of the last time I saw my neurosurgeon I was not showing enough of, or the right symptoms to operate. What makes the surgery to get part of my shunt replaced beyond normal complications is that shunts become frail the longer it is in our body, and will most likely fall apart when neurosurgeons try (or attempt to) remove them. With mine it is still doing it is job even if there is places where it is not connected, because the hole exists where the shunt used to be. Of course I do not know what your scans look like, but is there a chance that it is still working like mine? I think it does not work at all! Neuro said the shunt looks good but my tube is calcified. I can feel my broken tube. I had scans done last August with the same pains etc and everything was fine but I do not understand why I have this. It is so uncomfortable. I started feeling pain on Tuesday when I went a weird angle with my neck. I am not sure if I irritated something and now it just needs to get used to the position. I am alert with no nausea but where my shunt is located (back of head) along with my neck and shoulder feels so tight, achy and lots of pressure. My anxiety is through the roof because I am moving countries in 2 days and I just want some peace of mind that this pain is just because of the tube getting irritated from that sudden movement. Where is it broken/calcified? Mine hurts too, especially when I do a lot heavy lifting at work too fast. My shunt is on the right side of my head in the back and from there I have a tube that runs down until my abdomen. Where it is broken is next to my collar bone. 90% of the time I do not even realize I have a shunt, but there is times like these that I feel pain in the shunt \u00e1rea and panic. I am also a hypochondria so this is a bit of a nightmare!! Does your shunt feel sore sometimes when you move your neck too fast, or move it at a weird angle? Yes, but mostly when I sleep wrong.

I go to a HUGE hospital in Michigan and have been helped by them and then too, I also have been helped by the local hospitals I have had surgery at.\n\nMost hospitals have things that can help you with the cost of things. Call the Social Work department at the hospital you have had surgery at.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making a GFM after the hospital has helped you and you have got a balance. Thank you! I will contact them shortly! You are welcome. I did not know that hospitals helped like this. \n\nYou might want to wait to ASK for help WHEN the bills finally do come in. IF you do it ASAP, they are going to tell you to WAIT anyway, and then too they might be so willing to help. (this is just my opinion).\n\nFrom experience you should not arrange payment for hospital bills until you have received 3 like bills. A lot of the time hospitals will re-submit bills because things have been added, etc. or something was not added to the bill etc. I was told by the major hospital I go to for my brain surgeries to wait until you have received 3 like bills, so I always WAIT.\n\nAfter waiting for the final bill, I would then set up an appointment or just \"drop\" in on the social work dept. Make sure that you have a copy of the final bills with you when you visit the Social Worker. \n\nThe last hospitalization I had the hospital wiped almost the entire bill away. I think I ended up paying $600, which I was allowed to make payments on. \n\nLastly, do not \"ignore\" the bills...it just makes it worse and worrying about not paying is really hard on everyone. Even if it takes you 3-4 yrs to pay the balance, most hospitals WILL work with you IF you are trying. I have never seen a hospital billing department refuse to work with me, ever.\n\nGood luck.

You are good. Based on my experience, hell yeah you can. I do everyday and have never had an issue. I use it it to medicate and had a consultation in a medicinal state, but moved back to a lame state.\n\nEdit: worst case, it slows your CSF production for a short while by paralyzing the cilia that produce the CSF, which will not affect anything because your shunt function is based on intracranial pressure, so if the CSF drops below that threshold pressure, it will stop shunting fluid and not bother you. So you will feel great because you have a lower intracranial pressure AND you will be stoned.\n\nDouble edit: your neurosurgeon cannot advise you to do so out of risk of liability. Them telling you to do whatever you wanted meant go for it, otherwise they would have explicitly forbidden it. Toke up. Reduces inflammation and makes you feel better. \n\nIve only been smoking for a few years, but have had 4 of my 13 in that time period and have smoked after all of them.

I started to realize alot of my quirks were not quirks, they were symptoms. And its all been downhill from there. Hello,\n\nbefore thinking about costs for surgeries / meds: Is it possible for you to get an MRI scan to better determine if you really have hydrocephalus? I am. In two days. And my other doctor does not have high hopes. Just was hoping for answers to dull some of my worries One of the great things I have learnt about some of the meds recently is that some of the ones not covered by your insurance have coupons from the manufacturer that will then cover a lot of the copay so that they are not like $700 (I think sometimes they literally become free). The migraine sub has a lot of info on this. I do not know a huge amount about it because I am from Australia so we have a socialised healthcare system but I am glad the manufacturers are sometimes helping people access the meds in the US. I understand your concerns as mine are the same. I was recently diagnosed and have a second MRI (a CSF flow) and an LP scheduled soon. Find out what your benefits are and make sure the facilities, doctors, and labs are in network. Costs are public, and will be shared as long as you ask. I know how much my second MRI costs (my portion) but am still I am terrified of the surgery/hospital stay and how much it will cost. Good luck and feel free to reach out if you have questions. Had shunt surgery in Q2.  Private insurance through my employer, based in north eastern United States.  Hospital bill = $63k.  My deductible was previously met for the year.  My out of pocket cost was $8 for my spouses meal. My mother had all the symptoms of NPH, and rather severe. She also had 3 MRIs done since 2014, the latest one being in the fall of 2020. Last 3 MRIs reported on NPH characteristics, but no one said anything to her about it, probably since her symptoms were so mild at that time. Now I have been her 24/7 caregiver for the last 3 years, and look at all her medical reports/tests/etc, I found the note NPH in her latest MRI. I brought it to a recommended neurologist and he said \u201cshe definitely does not have NPH, and I would not even recommend a lumbar puncture\u201d. So, I brought her to Mass General Hospital in Boston for a second opinion. Her doctor thought that she might have it, and ordered the spinal tap. She met with 2 neurologists and a neurosurgeon after they saw minor improvements following the tap, and they all agreed she had it. Had her shunt in Feb of this year, and she slowly gained abilities and is now a far cry improved from where she was even 3 years ago. \n\nMy point: always push.

I was wondering if anyone who has a VP shunt put in later on in life could tell me whether or not you get worse muscular pain from all the coughing compared to before the shunt was put in?

Coughs and colds are the literal worst and I have taken myself to hospital before because I did not realise that there would be such a difference after the shunt. \n\nI find breathing in steam to soothe the cough helps. He needs as much sleep as possible too. Having the shunt slightly lowers his immune system so he will take a little longer than he used to to recover. Sleep, steam, eat, drink repeat. \u2764\ufe0f Oh thank you for this. I thought it may be slighter sore as it is a foreign object inside of his body by his chest \u2764\ufe0f It is likely the shunt. If it does not improve after the cold has gone then you should take him to hospital.

Have you been referred to a neurosurgeon? They are the experts, more than neurologists, for hydrocephalus. I would see one right away to get an opinion on surgery. Hydrocephalus is progressive so early treatment is important. I needed surgery to place a shunt. Even with revisions, my day to day experience is massively improved with the shunt. \n\nBrain injury inhabits a zone I do not quite know how to express, which is somehow not necessarily painful, but is systemic in a way no other injury I am aware of is. \n\nThe point I am trying to make is that brain injury sucks ass and makes everything lose it is edge. \n\nTreating hydrocephalus made that brain injury 2 points better on a scale of 10. Fewer headaches, less fog, less confusion. Go to the doctor\u2026the symptoms you describe may be a shunt malfunction. You should at least get evaluated by a neurologist or neurosurgeon", "Time off work So I am having an emergency surgery but I am wondering how much time i need so I can Gigi back to school and work I had an ETV and I took a full month off work and then slowly started working from home etc. I found it did take some time to get used to thinking and more so having the energy to think! That question is going to be answered differently by every person you ask.  It also depends on what kind of work you do.  After my last (emergency) surgery I found it took about a week before I felt like I was back at full mental capacity which is really all I need for my work as a software developer.  In terms of physical recovery it took about 2-3 weeks before I felt like I was back to full strength.  For reference, I am a 34 year old male whose hydrocephalus does not affect me in significant ways as a husband, father, software developer, and cyclist. I did two weeks after my ETV thinking it would be alright to return to grad school but found it tough in the end.  I went back because I was bored at home but that is not the right reason as I learned.  I would instead recommend taking as much time as the doctors recommend.  Remember that even though the physical recovery can be quick, the mental (psychological and emotional) recovery can take a lot longer.  I am still feeling burnt out and a bit lackluster after everything that went on in my last surgeries four months ago. I too went back to work about 2 weeks after my ETV. But i went back part time until my disability was approved. Forgot to mention I was part time back at school for the first few weeks, too. I went to class a couple days a week, did some research, etc. Only went back to lab work after 8 weeks. How long ago was your ETV? Wondering how you are doing long term as mine is new and I am still a bit antsy about it. Mine was nearly 2 years ago (two years in January ) and i have been okay. Not completely, i do have some symptoms but they come and go. Just go to your neurologist and have a MRI in a few months to see how it is doing. Report your symptoms if you have them to your Neuro. Great to hear!  How are your symptoms?  I get occasional dizzy spells but have been told it is ok.  Great to hear from someone else with ETV on the sub! For sure ! My symptoms are mostly dizziness and loss of balance but brain fog and difficulty speaking are there too. I also do not have a good memory any longer and forget a lot of stuff. So much so that i write down what i have to do for each day. Yeah my short term memory has taken a while to recover.  Probably should not be on reddit in the office for just that reason hahaha.  And at least improvements are happening all the time.  Hope you continue your recovery! It all depends on the person. I have taken 6 wks off for one revision and another revision I was back to work in 4 days. I just got out of surgery 4 hours ago and they did more than I thought I work at a restaurant. My surgery was an emergency one and the pulled the catheter out of my brain and changed my valve and the tubing. I need to go back to school as I am a digital communications student. And I want to go back to work at well Did you have a shunt put in? You too!! I am probably older than you  (well on Sunday i will be) and i am not sure if my memory will return. \n\nI hope that you pay attention to your pressure and symptoms and get occasional scans and exams if there are any. Let me know if you ever have questions and update me on how you are occasionally. Sounds great! Thanks! Yea they pulled that one part from my brain changed the shunt and the tubing So your brain will need to seriously recover. I do not know how you went with your first surgery, but I rested heavily for 4 weeks after my ETV on the recommendation of my neurosurgeon. I am a lawyer though so I could not really go back to work easily. Ill be 3 months post op soon and only recently feeling about 95% back to normal but every brain is different. My first 4 went ok I had them when I was a baby. The 5th one I threw up for 3 weeks then had a seizure. My 6th one was going well until Thursday. And this is my 7th one. My fianc\u00e9 works with me so I think when he goes back Ii want to go too so I can get used to being awake for 8 hours then ease into work. But til I feel like I can work I am just going to hang out at my job", "Papilledema from Hydrocephalus? Does anyone have papilledema from hydro? My son had it until his pressure was correctly regulated. If you have a shunt and are still showing papilledema I think you need to see your neurosurgeon to see why your pressure is so high. Yeah I am getting another surgery next week to fix it I had papilledema to the 300 level when I had fungal meningitis. This was pre-shunt. It started effecting my vision. (But it all came back thank god.) Unfortunately this is one of the  first symptoms you get in event of shunt failure. It sucks. \n\nI know a person/friend who went totally legally blind from papilledema from hydro. (Within 2 weeks.) Sorry i am no native english speaker: What does \"legally blind\" mean? Is the person unable to see anything (like if a light is turned on or off) or is the vision of the person very bad? Damn, and yeah I am on diamox until they change my shunt this week Yep, mine was bad prior to me being shunted. It caused issues with my vision too. Yes I have it, it is slowly going down but it is there I know the feeling :( How is your vision? My vision is 20/20 with glasses as long as I am on diamox. I am getting a VP replacement on Wednesday. Fingers crossed and prayers they fix me this time! Good luck to you, I did not know I had Hydrocephalus when mine was discovered so I had some vision loss in one eye but since you already have a shunt it sounds like yours should be fixed before there is any serious problems Legally blind means your blindness is so bad that you qualify for disability. It is a pretty complicated term but you can find more info online. \n\nYes\u2014 it is very bad. She needs to learn Braille and can barely see shadows with the lights turned completely on. She is almost completely blind. \n\nHer case is incredibly rare and brought on by extreme hydrocephalus\u2014 from fungal meningitis. BUT I tell people this because people do not normally talk about these things. \n\nHydro-research is underfunded in a lot of ways so I feel it is a form of advocacy to bring up these kinds of cases to people. (Galvanize action if you will.) Best of luck to you. I am sure you will do great. Whenever my shunt was blocked I did. It was normally the indicator that it was blocked. Yeah mine is blocked , getting another surgery", "Newcomer Support Megathread I have noticed a lot of posts on here are from new parents who want to know about our/our parent\u2019s experiences in having hydrocephalus and how our lives have turned out. I thought starting a megathread where everyone can go to read about the negative side of hydrocephalus as well as the fulfilling lives that follow. Feel free to comment what your experience has been like and maybe some hopeful words for all those nervous newcomers! Thank you for this! These threads have been really meaningful to me and my family. I am just hoping it gets more people involved. I will go ahead and post my story when I have time I am 29 now and was diagnosed at 13 months. I had my first shunt put in then and my arterial veinal malformation embolised. My ventricles collapsed and became rigid when I was about 3. I had a lot of shunt revisions due to my ventricles being collapsed. I have had somewhere between 150-200 revisions. Luckily I live in Australia so everything was paid for and hospital care was really great. \n\nUnfortunately we did live about 2.5 hours from the nearest hospital until I was about 7 so there was a lot of driving back and forth and I have two older siblings which made it hard. I know my parents struggled quite a bit and it probably was difficult for my siblings although they have never complained. I am very close with both of my siblings too.\n\nA year and a half ago I had cerebral stents placed to open up my blood vessels and allow the diffusion of CSF into the vasculature system. This was attempted as they would decided shunts were not working for me with how much they were blocking. It was very successful and I have been surgery free since. This is the second longest I have ever gone without surgery. I had trouble sleeping for about a year after this surgery but really that was the only side effect. Given I was still able to get back in to cycling and running and working full time, I still count this as very successful.\n\nWhile my surgeries are probably on the high side for someone with hydrocephalus I have been lucky to not have many other effects on my abilities. Due to this I have progressed through school at a normal rate and never been on disability. I am currently finishing up my PhD in Chemistry and work full time. I moved out at 19 and now own two houses with my partner of 11 years. I compete regularly in triathlons and play a couple of team sports when I have time. Hydrocephalus does not always mean there will be a big change in the normal expected life experiences of a person. I (M23) was premature, my mom birthing me at 29 weeks (I know, terrifying). I was diagnosed with Aqueductal Stenosis which meant that my 4th aqueduct was closed leading to hydrocephalus. They put in a ventriculoperotineal (VP) shunt, still have the scar above my belly button. The technology was new at the time so following the first procedures I continued to have revision surgeries once a year from 1-5 years old. I cannot leave out my parents, now older they openly discuss how they felt during this time. I was their first kid, they were terrified. Luckily my extended family is large, supportive, and close by. We are fortunate enough that my dad co owns his company with my uncle so he picked up the slack giving my dad time to be with me in the NICU. And I have to give thanks to the Ronald McDonald House for giving my parents a place to stay right next door to the hospital during my stay.\n\nAfter that I had a very normal childhood. Aside from avoiding playing football and never scuba diving I can confidently say I had a very normal childhood. When I was 14 my appendix burst and because of fear that an infection could have gone to my brain they moved the shunt line to drain into my pleural cavity (VPL). Now I am 23, I check in with my neurosurgeon every 2-3 years just to be safe. Occasionally on a rainy day I will feel a little more tired, barometric pressure affects the shunt minimally. With friends and dating it can be a little weird when they ask about the scar or feel the shunt. I am comfortable talking about it, it can just be a lot for other people to take in. I guess the only other downside is that I tried to get in the bone marrow transplant list and after informing them of my aqueductal stenosis and their lack of a medical professional on site they said they were too afraid of an infection and said I could not sign up at this time (PS if there was an infection in my brain I would be dead but ok).\n\nFinally for all those parents out there wondering if their kid can live a normal life. I am now living in an apartment on my own working as a server at a popular new restaurant while just receiving my EMT-Basic license. Hoping to start working soon! I try to give back to the March of Dimes as they are an amazing support network for parents with premature children. Also spend some time volunteering at the local children\u2019s hospital in the play room. Making sure kids can keep busy and meet their developmental milestones while in the hospital. Funny enough it is the same floor I stayed on as a kid! Even saw some familiar faces. I am exploring the vegan diet. No affect on my shunt so far not that I expected there to be. I also love running, going to train to run a half marathon at the end of the summer! Hope this helps calm your nerves a little, I will try to get more info from how my parents handled this tough time. Good luck! Parent perspective. My daughter was born premature at 27 weeks due to some complications. She had a grade 3 intraventricular  hemorrhage that led to her hydrocephalus. This is a case of acquired (not congenital / born with it), non-communicating, obstructed hydrocephalus. It is the most common form for premature babies. She had her first surgery around 1 month old. She has had 2 revisions that were both before her second birthday. She spent probably 6 month in hospitals in her first two years of life, including her 4 1/2 month NICU stay, revisions and close calls. The probability of a revision is pretty high in the first two years of life due to the constant growing and development they are going through. In these first couple years I transitioned from a person who hated the hospital to one who feels very safe in one. Children\u2019s hospital, NICU\u2019s and ante/postpartum wings, and women\u2019s hospitals are generally nicer than generic adult ones. \n\nEveryday life with a toddler who has hydrocephalus in my case has been very much like that of a normal little kid. She is pretty tough. It is almost concerning at times how she does not seem to be phased by physical pain, though her ego is just as fragile as any little kids. She does have to go in for extra check ups but that is pretty easy to deal with. We live in a city and everything is close. The vomiting is the hardest thing to handle. Mine throws up a lot, more hereditary than anything, but it is definitely something I have to keep an eye on. \n\nParenting can be unnerving at times, but much of the time I really do not think about her hydrocephalus. I do get anxious about vomiting, but it has gotten better and I have learned to consider the other symptoms of a shunt malfunction before throwing everyone in the car and heading to the hospital. The pediatrician will always send you to the Er. The Er will frequently admit you. No one wants to be the one to discharge a hydrocephalus kid only to have them need a revision a day later. Consider this with your insurance planning (US). Also a go bag can be nice, but really remembering a phone charger and an extra set of clothes and comfy shoes is really all you need. People may treat you like a hurt puppy. They may avoid asking questions because they are uncomfortable. It can be easy to feel isolated simply because most people will not ask you about things because they think it will upset you, and you will not want to talk about it for fear of being a downer. \n\nMy daughter is nearly 3. Has zero cognitive issues and negligible physical impairments stemming from her prematurity. At a play ground with kids all born healthy I feel unlucky, but in the context of a Children\u2019s hospital seeing the hands some people were dealt I am thankful for all the health that she does have. \n\nI am totally happy to answer any questions private or posted regarding NICU and hydrocephalus life from a parent perspective.", "My 39 year old Aunt is currently in the ICU   . \n\nPlease pray for my Aunt Liz, she is only 39 years old, she had a stroke because of her high blood pressure and is in the hospital in the ICU , she been here for two weeks now. She is not able to speak. When she had the stroke she fell and hit her head, which caused bleeding in her brain on both sides. They put a tube in her head to remove the blood. The bleed is smaller now. The doctors do not know how long it will be until they find out how much damage has been done. They want to put a shunt in her head. What should my family and I expect?.... We have absolutely no idea, please inform me. If could take months. Please keep her in your prayers. Sorry to hear about your aunt, I do not have any advice but I am thinking about your family Thank you A shunt is just a drain, in an of itself it is nothing to worry about. The stroke is the big thing. All the best and sending healing thoughts her way.", "Why does the neck part of my shunt hurt sometimes? I have had a VP shunt for 10 years, and sometimes I get this random pain in my neck right where the tube passes. The pain usually lasts for a few minutes and goes away. During that pain, I try to ease it by turning my head to the side to apply a gentle pressure to that part in my neck. I cannot apply my hand directly to the spot because I still feel squeamish if I touch that part of my neck with too much force. I am thinking it has something to do with dehydration but I am not really sure. I would like to know that as well! Particularly annoying when it is focused right where the shunt connects with the back part of the neck. I have only had a shunt about 18 months but I do know what you mean. I think it must be kind of like when you move your neck in a certain way and it pulls s little like a muscle/sleeping funny I had that a lot when I had a shunt, no clue but maybe just occasional inflammation? Really not sure but I got it every so often, never terrible but certainly uncomfortable. There is plenty of causes. Can you give us any more details? I am not really sure how to elaborate, but it is normally sudden pain, sometimes a pulsing pain. It is specifically just in the spot of my neck where the tube passes by. It can happen at random times, like sometimes when I am lying in ned, sometimes when I am at work. NSAIDs do not relieve this pain. Any swelling? No swelling", "Weight change Has anyone suffered from changes in pressure headaches etc with weight gain, I have been getting a few pressure headaches lately and think it may be weight related. I am about 30 pounds heavier than when the shunt went in, obviously I am going to work on loosing weight anyway, I think there must be a particular weight where they kick in. Sorry, it has nothing to do with weight. Depending on where you live the weather changes have the most impact. I get them the other way, when j go down in weight significantly i get the headaches. I have gone up in weight the last year and a half, about 30 lbs, and had no problem", "What would you do? I am feeling so defeated.  Decided a hydrocephalus community may be able to understand me/give me some guidance.  I have adult onset, diagnosed at 23 I am now 31.  My last shunt was placed 5 years ago but I am having some symptoms that are freaking me out.  My usual dull headache has morphed into a throbbing pain that is pretty much always there and then there are sharp burst of pain on the front part of my forehead. I am using my icekap a lot! I am also super nauseous, been throwing up all weekend. \n\nI called my neurosurgeon, because I have not seen him since 2015 when he put my last shunt in apparently I would be a new patient in their system. They recommended I contact my neurologist who I have an active relationship with. He orders a CT but it came back normal. \n\nWhen the nurse told me she was so excited to tell me my CT looked great!! She wanted to call me RIGHT AWAY.      \n\nI cried.  \n\nI am no closer to any answers, or a resolution.  \n\nI am in constant pain, I am always feeling on the verge of puking and I am also having these weird ass visual disturbances. I keep thinking something is right behind me or next to me.  It is not scary but it is as if someone is standing by me, I look and no one is there.  Driving home I thought I kept seeing deer.  I feel lost.  \n\nAny advice? stay safe fren You too \ud83d\ude0a sorry you are going through this.  Can someone advocate for you? Help you stay on top of appointments and research options? \n\nLet us know. i have gone through 3 revisions, if you have any more questions i can answer what i know Keep pressing with your neurologist or GP.  Those symptoms should not be a normal life for anyone, and I am sure in time you can find a treatment.  Good luck and be well! Ask if you can have a shunt tap! My kid's shunt sometimes shows no change on the CT but he will be in full blown failure that is only diagnosed by symptoms and a shunt tap. I had this problem (normal pictures, normal everything, but awful pain). Something they did to try to check if it is \"worth fixing\" (because these folks forget that it HURTS and it ruins your life, and that is reason enough!) Is a lumbar puncture to do something like an open pressure reading. The thing about lumbar punctures though is that they REALLY SUCK if you are awake. There is crazy random pain that does not make sense in different parts of your body, it is awful. Anyway, they did not think it was \"enough\" because I was only slightly above average pressure, so that is when I got a second opinion, and the second opinion was horrified that the first people had not done anything. \n\n  *  So your best option might be getting a second opinion.\n\n  *  Another option that was mentioned in this thread was a \"shunt tap,\" which sounds A LOT better than a lumbar puncture. The bar for better than a lumbar puncture is pretty low though. Eating dog poo and ripping out your own toenails are also better than lumbar punctures IMO.\n\nIf you do get a lumbar puncture, if you can get them to give you more than a single Valium and a pat on the arm, I would take it. You really should not drive afterwards anyway. \n\n  *  You could also have over-drainage. If it even slightly feels better when you lay down flat, that might be it.\n\nThis is kind of obvious but if you get worse, go to the ER. \n\nThe majority of people on here have spent time where you are right now, and I know it does not make the pain and neuro symptoms better, but you are not alone in this. \n\nAlso, if you are on mobile, there are apps that will take your brightness below \"0%\", and I noticed that this helped a lot for when I had to use my phone. I am on Android, and I use Lux Lite. \n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV. This is not medical advice. Thank you everyone for your replies! I have not been able to respond until now.  My neurologist actually called me later in the evening after getting the note from his nurse that called me to deliver the \u201cgreat news\u201d from my CT. He wants me to push to see my neurosurgeon.  He is thinking everything you guys are saying.. maybe a shunt tap, possible ICP monitoring, revision.  Either way it would be from him.  I have had all of them before with previous shunts it is just been a while and his office is at a new hospital so the system sees me as a new patient because of it.  I need to get a message to his MA or him directly. Hopefully with the CT and talking with my GP and neurologist already will help me get the message past the receptionist.  \n\nI do have a good team around me that will make sure no matter what needs to be done will be done.  Just stinks that we have to suffer for a bit before things get figured out.  I was on disability for a while, I have only been working for less than a year and all of this run around gives me weird ptsd.  The admin aspect of healthcare is exhausting. Makes you think you are crazy and want to give up for sure. I will not though, thank you all so much for your kind words and answers.  Just having people understand what I am feeling helps more than anything.  \u2764\ufe0f I feel your pain. 4 years ago when I was 42 my headaches started and after 3 years ago my neurologist at Johns Hopkins finally get my settings rights. Before my VP shunt and ASD settings were set I had your symptoms and when they did CT scans and MRIs everything looked \u201cnormal\u201d. Keep advocating for yourself and have a family member help you with that. You may want to see a psychiatrist and just see what they can do also. Scan after scan coming back normal is so frustrating when you know something is wrong! I was able to get an appt with my neurosurgeon for aug 5th.  Fingers crossed I can make it till then and we can figure something out.  \n\nWhat is ASD? I have a programmable shunt, we have been playing with my settings.  Have not had an adjustment in a few yrs so I imagine he will start there. I have a programmable VP shunt and the ( (anti siphon device) which basically fine tunes the flow from the shunt. The shunt has levels 0-8 and the ASD has 0-25 (I think) to go in smallest steps. I got it 2 years ago and the surgery went off great. It was installed behind my right ear and kind of makes my glasses slip around a bit.\n\nI had 17 adjustments until we got it where I am now. I get slight headaches once in while that I can still function with. \n\nI have been through it all and Johns Hopkins has been amazing. I have to check in with them every 12 months unless there is an issue.\n\nIf you have anymore questions or anything just shoot me a message. I feel just as lost as you and just found this community. All I can offer for now is solidarity because I am just beginning to understand what the hell is going on myself. You are not alone! Thank you  :). I am still struggling with symptoms but trying to make it to my appt with my neurosurgeon on the 5th. One week \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb.", "17 year old with 16 year old VP shunt My 17 year old son received a shunt when he was 11 months old because he  developed meningitis following surgery to deal with a huge arachnoid cyst. He had four surgeries by the time he was two. We have always been vigilant because we know how often shunts can fail. We have had some scares, but never needed a revision. Last year he developed a tremor, so we had appts with neurosurgery and neurology. \n \nHe had a brief MRI and X-ray to look at the shunt. His shunt tubing has broken at the level of his neck. The neurosurgeon said that it is possible it broke years ago and he has functioned fine without it. I have read up about this and I have read about similar situations where it seems possible it is still managing to drain, just not in his abdomen. \n\n I have a couple questions if anyone has any insight. We have follow up scheduled. I would just like to hear from people who deal with it firsthand. 1) if you have had a shunt tubing break, did you have a revision?  2) did you feel any discomfort around the breakage? This group has been really helpful to my son and me. Thanks! I have had several shunts break (and in several different locations) - I had my first one placed at 6 months old and I am 31 now. My most recent revision was in April 2021. It was my 6th revision - they seem to happen about once every 7-8 years now (they were more frequent when I was younger).\n\nI do not usually experience pain at the specific point the tube has broken. Instead, what I experience is what you will typically see when you google \u201cbroken shunt symptoms\u201d - awful, awful headaches + nausea + dizziness + fatigue. \n\nMy most recent broken shunt may have actually broken originally around December 2019, nearly 18 months before I got it fixed, based on symptoms I had then. However, they receded and it seems the tube was able to drain fluid for a while longer before it became quite an issue for me this year. So that is definitely possible. \n\nI hope this is helpful and that your son is able to get the help + relief he needs soon!\n\nEDIT: Meant to add that I believe my own shunt placement was done in connection to having meningitis as a baby as well, though I am a little unclear on those details and will need to ask my mom again. An interesting connection, though! My shunt tubing has never broken but much like your son my 1st shunt did last a very long time (almost 18 years to be exact) and then all of a sudden this year it just malfunctioned... I am sorry to hear that. Did they revise the existing shunt or place a new one? I hope you are recovering well. At first they just replaced the catheter but I was still having problems after so they replaced the whole thing...thanks but it was back in February to March of this year...I am doing just fine though...hope your son is doing ok... Thank you. This was really helpful. One of neurosurgeons made it seem like the break with no immediate symptoms could be a positive thing. Meaning he no longer needs the shunt. It sounds like it is still just as important to keep the emergency plan in place. Yeah, absolutely. If there are not symptoms, I think most neurosurgeons definitely prefer the, \u201cif it are not broke\u201d approach because poking around is always risky, even if it is \u201croutine.\u201d\n\nI hope he stays symptom-free for a long, long time, though! :)", "Feeling objects inside my head + feeling like my brain is about to pop. Is this hydrocephalus? It started 3 years ago and it got worse with time.I was really stressed out and I started to feel an awful sensation in the right side of my head,followed by a reduced ability to feel emotions.\nI should mention that those wires I feel were \"born\" out of that heavy, extreme pressure I was feeling in the right side of my brain when I forced myself to remember something. \n\nWith time it became worse and worse.I found it harder and harder to remember what I was doing yesterday,two,three days ago. So I tried to force myself to remember which was a great mistake.\n\nIt almost felt like something in my head cracked,followed by an intense pressure in the right side of my brain and an almost metallic feeling. After that weird pressure started to fade away,I started feeling some weird things inside my brain.I can feel two sets of wires that are hoof shaped on the right and left side of my brain,and at their base there is something round,like a ball made of clay.I can feel another ball of clay right inside my head and something like a wall right in the middle of my brain(but the wall is not complete,there is a hole in it and next to that hole that hole a ball of clay...).I can feel other things too but only occasionaly...What is the most perplexing thing is that there is symmetry,are those the contents of my brain??\n\nNowadays I lack completely the feeling of hunger,emotional response,ambition and I find it really hard to think :/\nAt the same time, I am pretty sure that my skull suffered physical changes, it definitely changed it is shape almost like it is about to pop. It definitely grew in size in one part, did something like this happen to anyone else? This is a situation for a doctor. Even knowing a a patient has hydrocephalus only does so much for addressing their current condition. Doctors have to rely on imaging like MRI, CT, and x rays to diagnose the current shape of a particular persons brain. I am sorry you do not feel well, but please seek trained and equipped medical advice. No one here, even a doctor, can give you accurate information.", "Cannot believe it is been that long ", "Is it ok if my baby lays on the side of the shunt (VP)? Anything I should be cautious with? ", "Some weird new symptoms? So I have had hydrocephalus since birth, I am in my mid-twenties now and have been lucky enough to only have 2 surgeries, both when I was 12. I went for a check-up with the neurosurgeon recently, I had been experiencing some minor headaches (pressure/fullness especially around shunt area, which I found alarming) but I got those intermittently for years. Anyway the doctor said that my shunt tract felt like it was wearing out or something, and also that the shunt slipped out of the ventricle. My ventricles were always wicked small and on the scan, they are quite visibly larger than they usually are for me but still about the range of \"normal\" and since my symptoms were not serious or anything they just decided to wait and see. Which makes me mad nervous, I hate feeling like another revision is inevitable in the near future, although the doctor did say there is a not insignificant chance I will not need surgery at all (has anyone else been in a similar situation and what became of it? that is my first question)\n\n\nAnyway yesterday I noticed right above my shunt there is a large dent in my head that feels quite alarming to the touch. It does not hurt at all, but what could this mean?\n\nThanks yall!  To a laymen it sounds like your shunt is not working at full strength but you are not accumulating an excessive amount of fluid either. I am sure you could find someone to do a revision if you wanted to be super proactive, but obviously it is not a fun thing to go through. In my limited experience with my daughter her symptoms got pretty obvious that something was really wrong over the period of about 3-5 days. Vomiting, inability to focus vision, lethargy are her symptoms that a shunt has really failed. \n\nI cannot comment on the dent really beyond people have weird shaped heads. When in doubt call your neurologist and speak with the nurse about any concerns. They should be able to at least give you a little clairity.  I am happy you have only had two surgeries! That is awesome! Honestly, in my 4 surgeries, ( I have also had a shunt slip from my ventricle) it was totally worth it to get that shunt out and a new on in ASAP. I know surgery is terrible, but you having pain often is even worse. I am coming up on three years since my last shunt surgery next month, and I am so happy I had it! Hey there, I am 30 and just had my first revisions as an adult after being totally symptom\\-free for 22 years. When my shunt first failed last year, it did so really intermittently and it was difficult to catch on scans. Think of how your car makes that weird noise all the time except when you bring it into the shop. It seems that sometimes individual shunt components can start performing poorly for a while before failing altogether and requiring immediate surgery.\n\nI am not a medical professional by any means but here are a few things I can share that I wish I would known during the last year:\n\n1\\) **Annual baseline scans when you are in full health are super important.** \n\nAs an adult born with hydrocephalus, you are more likely to have slit\\-like ventricles, or ventricles smaller than the average adult\\-onset patient. This can make failure a lot more difficult to diagnose unless you have a comparison shot that the radiologist or neurosurgeon can look at to show normal functioning. I know for me, even a small dilation of the ventricles can produce extremely disruptive symptoms.\n\n2\\) **Stay close to a neurosurgeon who has treated you before and knows your case, if you can. Document your current treatment as thoroughly, but concisely, as possible.** If this is not practical, call your latest neurosurgeon and ask him/her to write down your shunt configuration, valve type \\*and pressure settings\\*, as well as any information they have about the cause of your last failure, and keep this information with you on a laminated card in your wallet. If you are traveling to another country, run that bad boy through google translate and keep a copy on you at all times. Drug allergies? Note them down too.\n\nI had my valve fail on me while I was abroad and was treated under emergency conditions by a surgeon who I would met on the night of surgery for the first time. I was basically treated similarly to an adult\\-onset hydrocephalus patient with a valve that did not do well for me and has since been replaced. Now, I do not go anywhere without my insert.\n\nThere is an iphone app called HydroAssist that has a cool way to note down your shunt valve settings, but it seems totally useless in practice since first responders or doctors a\\) cannot unlock your phone and b\\) are probably unaware of the app\n\n3\\) **Keep a diary of all your symptoms**. My mom was on my case to do this but I resisted initially due to inconvenience. Later on, became extremely useful.\n\n4\\) **Shunt failure symptoms as an adult may be different from those you experienced as a kid**.\n\nWhen I was a kid, shunt failures usually resulted primarily in an enlarged 3rd ventricle. As an adult, all my failures have resulted in enlargement primarily of the 4th ventricle. As a kid, it was all splitting headaches and vomiting. As an adult, it was slight mental fogginess, spatial disorientation and a true positional vertigo that came out of nowhere and stuck around, double vision when looking in one direction, and a wicked tinnitus, but absolutely no headaches at all until the total failure of the valve. This all happened in the space of a few weeks from totally excellent health as an adult prior to shunt failure.\n\n5\\) **Hope for the best but prepare for the long game.**\n\nMake sure you always keep the best health insurance you can afford. If you are unemployed at any point, medicaid/managed care can be a great option, particularly in NY and MA\\- definitely check to see what health insurance plans your primary neurosurgeon is in\\-network for before making any decisions. Travelling abroad? Get travel medical insurance. Travelex and Aon offer some really comprehensive options. They cover you for up to a month for about $100. Sounds like a lot, until they fly you home for free, with special accommodations and cover your treatment. I was lucky to benefit from this last year.\n\nTake the extra deduction from your paycheck for long\\-term disability. This will give you peace of mind. When I was a kid, I would get a shunt revision and be back in school the next week, no problem. This year, I had to take almost 9 months off due to all the complications I experienced and the need for repeated revisions.\n\n6\\) **When the sh\\*t hits the fan, have a good support network in place**.\n\nFigure out who will be available to help take care of you\\- try to spread it around between SO, family members, etc. so that it does not all fall on one person.\n\n7\\) **Mental health is as important as physical health.**\n\nGetting a shunt revision as an adult is a stressful experience. First, there is the ambiguity of not knowing whether your shunt is failing or if it is all in your head. Then, there is surgery itself which may come with its own complications. There is confronting your own mortality, realizing how fragile your health really is, after coming off of the post\\-20s delusion that you are invincible. There is dealing with your loved ones whose worry about your well\\-being can sometimes even express itself as hostility, nagging, resentment, over\\-parenting, etc. There is being yanked out of a really promising job or professional setting, trying to manage your employer's expectations. There are likely financial stresses and considerations. \n\nANY ONE OF THE ABOVE WOULD INDIVIDUALLY WARRANT SOME TIME WITH A GOOD THERAPIST. Remember that even though you have overcome a lot, you are still human. Please make sure you are getting the mental health support you need. I have a great therapist, but even with her help it can be tough. Mindfulness, meditation, therapeutic coloring books. They are all very much worth\\-while. The good news is that, after coming through all this, nothing will phase you! Now that I am re\\-entering my old life, all the things that used to stress me out in normal life seem totally insignificant.\n\n8\\) **You are not alone**.\n\nThank god for this reddit sub! There are also some great resources through the hydrocephalus association. Later on when you are doing better, paying it forward and talking to families going through this crap might make you feel good too.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me if you have anything you want to discuss, or even if you just want to vent.\n\nLook, let us hope it is nothing. Maybe your symptoms are coming from something else. But if your shunt does fail this year, you will definitely get through it, and you will be a stronger adult for it.\n\nCheers and best of health. I have kind of wondered if adult symptoms may differ from childhood symptoms. I feel like last time at the doctor, we left it as we were waiting for the symptoms I experienced last time. I am probably going back into the doctor soon , and I will ask about that I mean if it was that cut-and-dry, I would do it. I am not 100% sure my symptoms are due to my shunt or something else, and additionally I know that new shunts are more likely to fail than ones that have been in for some time, and since I have had my current one for twelve years now, I would rather not \"start over\" so to speak for that reason Excellent response!", "3 Lessons Hydrocephalus taught me ", "Feel like my shunt is shrinking? I feel like my shunt is shrinking into my head, or like my skull is growing around it.  Cannot put it into words.\n\nI had a revision about 10 years ago, and I am curious.  Is this normal?

My hydrocephalus is due to a blockage from a benign tumor, but due to the tumor being too vascular they were unable to do a biopsy.  \n\nFor about the last month or two my symptoms have started to come back (losing balance, headaches, blurry vision). I had an MRI Monday and the neuro called and confirmed my ventricles were enlarged again.  I have another appointment with him on Monday to discuss my options.\n\nIf my ETV is failing, am I looking at getting a shunt or can the ETV surgery be performed again? Following this for my own questions... My son's Neuro says an ETV can be performed again. He has not needed a re-do, five. years out from surgery. The longer you are from surgery, the more likely that you will not possible ever have an issue again. Although it can be re-done, I would imagine it would depend on whether the NS thought it was working for the individual or if they would be better off with shunt. How old was your son when he had his first one done? My baby had his at 4 months and it is still working at 7 months. They said if it fails they will do a shunt, but I am wondering about another ETV. He was ten. He had a shunt from 11 months to age 8, then multiple shunt revisions until age ten, when they decided he might be a good candidate for  ETV. My own research on ETV is that some cases are a good match from the get go, depending on the underlying condition that caused hydro, where obstruction is, etc. For some, later placement is more successful, but again, this all depends on the particular presentation. My son has an arachnoid cyst above the brain stem. Thanks for the info. I had an appointment with my neuro today - shunt surgery is scheduled for Thursday. :( Mine failed back in february and I had to get the whole thing replaced.  My symptoms started in january.  My vision is already very bad from the resulting optic nerve damage hydro caused me before birth but it got worse and I got an extreme migraine that came and went and got worse each time leading up to where I would see flashes of light in my vision like someone was taking flash photography inside my eye even when my eyes were closed.  I started to hear what sounded like a loud windstorm outside but it was also in my head.  When I was in the car it felt like I was on a roller coaster.  These symptoms intensified over a few weeks and I finally went to the hospital expecting to get some migraine medication because every previous time I went in saying my shunt is probably failing they said nope it is fine here is some migraine medication so I expected the same but nope doc comes back and says your shunt is broken and you need to go for surgery.", "3 year old and eating habits. Anyone have any idea how to get a 3 year old to eat more or eat anything? A way of adding more nutrients and calories to build him up? \n\nHe eats very little, it has to be specific brands or he will not eat whatever it may be. His near 2 year old brother is about to be bigger than him and already weighs more.\n\nWhat about these weight gain supplements or similar, given in small amounts like a milk shake mix? Would something like this help build him up a little (if we can get him to eat it?) would it be safe?\n\nHoping someone here has some experience of this.\nThe little boy in question is my girlfriends son, he is an amazing little boy and I am still learning a lot about hydrocephalus.\n\nMany thanks. That sounds like a question for a pediatrician. Kids can be picky, but I have never heard of hydrocephalus effecting appetite. I would want to make sure it is not something else.  Never heard of it! Every official medical website I have been on for the topic of hydrocephalus says that eating disorders are normal/common for anyone born with hydro. \nNone seem to advise on how to get a child to eat better though or give supplements to give! A feeding or speech therapist would be beneficial, your pediatrician can send a referral. If he is losing weight or not following his growth curve on the charts they may suggest a gtube. Pediasure is a cmon suggestion to increase weight but does not help eat more, as it often fills them up. Lots of butter and oils added to his foods, and keep trying to branch out what he does eat. How much does he weigh? What is his height? Is his growth chart looking good?  I have been to a countless pediatricians, neurologists, surgeons, specialists and know scores of nurses and therapists. Everyone on this sub has first hand knowledge of the condition. Just because my research into where how the disease manifests does not make my knowledge any less credible. Nausea can be common. I would work with your care team to asses the nausea and ensure everything is working well. There are nausea medicines for children on the market, but again you really need professional consultation. Messing with the ph of their stomachs can have implications as well. I have always found liquids to be easier to get into an unhappy child and would look towards shakes. There are a lot of protein shakes though with various levels of protein on the market. The more protein content in them can result in the chalky like taste that some people find unpleasant so finding ones they like will take some searching.

Keeping that in mind, how can I actually tell if its just the hydrocephalus or the coronavirus?  Coronavirus is an upper respiratory virus - meaning its a fever and cough if infected. The headache you will get from any type of virus (cold, flu, even covid19) will feel like a sinus headache where you are all stuffed up whereas pain from hydrocephalus will manifest as a much different feeling.

Since then, he is dealt with a lot of people telling him he cannot do a lot of things because of it, so he has some confidence issues.\n\nOne aspect of our job is memorizing complex passages of text and being able to recite it from memory as part of a product presentation. As his coach and mentor, I wanted to reach out here to ser if any of you have any tips or tricks for helping him be able to memorize things more easily. He is such a smart guy and I really want to help him see success, especially when he is got himself so convinced he is a screw up just because he learns more slowly due to his condition. So any advice you might have I would very much appreciate!!! You are such a nice person!! Thank you for being so considerate. Personally, I do not have memorization issues outside of normal people's. The only advice I have is practice makes perfect. Just because it takes you longer to memorize something does not mean you cannot do it.  I have never had trouble with numbers, but perhaps breaking them down into rhythmic groups can help remember. Instead of 26589632 maybe 265 89632 works better. \n\nOnce you have a rhythm, it becomes easier to ad to, like remembering the words to a song you have not heard in 10 years. From what I have figured out, just going over it over and over again does not work for me anymore since my last surgery. If there are concepts to understand, I would make sure he understood them, and if he needs to talk about things in a particular order, give him a reason why that order is the way it is. \n\nHow verbatim must the memorization be? There are portions that have to be exact, others just the concepts. I think his biggest struggle is if he gets interrupted in the middle of the presentation, it is much harder for him to remember where he left off. Why cannot he cheat with say a notecard as back up? I do not know exactly what your selling, but it seems like you could be able to get away with some well placed chest sheets. I just read how they changed scripts a lot in \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and in one part of the movie the character is doing something like reading a sacred parchment which actually has the new script written in it. \n\nFor what it is worth there memory troubles can happen to people with hydrocephalus, but it is not a given by any means.

I wanted to first say hi and offer a digital shoulder, as I too know how hard it is feeling like things are so out of your hands when, as a parent, it is our naturally occurring job to take care and fix our kids when they are unwell. Just a quick question. I am eight weeks new to this hydro thing (as my 17yr old has just been diagnosed and had an urgent ETV 2 weeks ago) so pardon me if I am being too basic, but did they do an MRI which monitored how much fluid was actually flowing to where it should be? If so are they doing that again at 1 yr to see what the fluid levels are?  I am not sure where you live, but did they send out a full letter of diagnosis outlining what their findings are and what is planned? It sounds like their communication may be lacking. Keep smiling and try to rest up, the mental stresses and strains are exhausting. I joined this sub just 2 weeks ago and it is been a great support space already, great you found it too. No, we have not received any paperwork but our whole state is in disarray after two hurricanes. They did do a MRI, and an ultrasound and her pediatrician says they trust their prognosis but I am just a little exhausted by the \u201cwe do not know why\u201d behind her delay. :( So I was diagnosed at age 20. As a child, I had difficulty crawling- I kind of skipped that and went straight from army crawling to walking (again, a little later than normal) and I never had excellent balance or hand/eye coordination, but other those delays I was perfectly fine. I think they call it compensating? I do not have a shunt and just get an MRI every two years to make sure the fluid remains steady. And yes, for the past decade, they have told me there is nothing they can do so I would assume it is normal-ish at least. My daughter was a preemie that developed hydrcephalus in the nicu , she was the same way.. This was in the 80's, she persevered and went on to get her master's in psychology\nStay positive..we went through some tough times but in the end it all turned out great On this topic, I have switched pediatricians because he has a tendency to not listen to the needs we have in our household right now.

I got my shunt put in at age 17 in 2007 when it was discovered that I had congenital hydrocephalus and had 10 times more spinal fluid in my brain. No one ever caught it when I was a baby, so I went years with symptoms and finally an OBGYN found the hydrocephalus after she wanted an MRI of my pituitary gland. It is been since 2007 that I got an adjustment from my neurosurgeon but ever since then, I have had no issues with my shunt. I have been to plenty of checkups and gotten lots of Cat Scans to make sure everything is working well. No complaints for many years, and I am very happy about it. Has anyone else had their shunt for a very long period of time? I am always nervous about a malfunction but have yet to experience that, and I am very grateful. I have had my shunt since I was born. I only needed a new shunt when I had appendicitis and had to get my original shunt removed in 2011. Since I got my new shunt, I have had no problems whatsoever. I am 20, by the way. I got my first shunt placed in 1995 when I was 21.  I had a large brain tumor that blocked off the way you normally drain spinal fluid.  That one lasted until 2015.  The tubing broke off in my neck and they replaced the entire thing.\n\nI had two more brain surgeries in 2019.  I had a brain infection from a pseudocycst that had formed along the shunt tract and my liver.  My neurosurgeon removed my shunt and I spent two weeks in ICU waiting for the infection to clear up.  They replaced my shunt on the other side of my head due to their being too much scar tissue on my right.  The first two shunts I had were non-programmable, the one I got in 2019 is programmable and I absolutely HATE it.  I have had pressure headaches on and off ever since I got the new one. We do not like your kind here. \n\n\nLol jk. Glad you are going strong and have not had issues with it. Lots of people have lots of issues, so you are a lucky one! Had my VP in since 2012.. Never needed a revision so far. I am still at least 2 years before another appointment to make sure it is still working I got my first shunt at 2 months in 1986 and did not need it replaced until I was 11. I have had 19 revisions total, but my last one was in 2012. I have had about 9 revisions. My last was in 2012, and now I am going into a police academy, so I count myself pretty lucky too. I feel you. I have had 6 revisions, but i have seen other redditors on this board state they have had over 50. \n\nMy first lasted 15 years, then I had an undiagnosed malfunction for 5 years (legit TERRIBLE \ud83d\ude22) then I had three revisions in three weeks. \n\nMy last revision has been going strong for three years. \n\nSince MRIs/Cat Scans cannot diagnose a malfunction for me, My doctors advice? If you are not dying, puking, or bleeding from the brain, we are not operating. So - My shunt is still going strong. Every day i say thanks to god that my shunt decided to work today! I had a shunt last from March 1996 to November 2011 and have not had an issue with the 2011 shunt since, so yes! On the other hand, I have a friend who is the same age as me who has had around 150 surgeries, so there is a very wide range. I think as long as you keep checking in, you will be just fine! 19 revisions as in replacements or just check ups????? Surgeries to replace the shunt 19 different shunts ? 9 different valves and 10 different full shunts What was your symptoms for those undiagnosed years?", "My 4 month old just had ETV surgery Our little man had hydrocephalus, head getting larger, eyes gazing downward (sun setting eyes)...anyway that surgery was Wednesday. We have noticed that his neck is stiff maybe? He can turn his head both directions but seems to struggle a bit. Wondering if anyone has had experience with an infant getting this surgery and what other things you noticed after the surgery. \n\nI read up on shunt surgery (could not find a whole lot on ETV)  and saw a post op side effect can be stiff neck and shoulders. I am hoping that is what it is. We see our neuro next week and will bring it up if it does not improve obviously. My 9 month old son had hydrocephalus and ETV surgery this past December. We did not know he had hydrocephalus until one morning he would not wake up. There is only one thing that I noticed weird before and even after his surgery sometimes he would tilt his head to one side, put a hand up and scream (hard to explain). I talked to his neurosurgeon about it at his 1 month follow up appointment and he said his CSF flow looked great but if I wanted to I could take him to a neurologist. I am not even joking when I say the next day he stopped and has not done it since.\n\nIt is very hard for me when he is crying or having a bad day to stop overthinking like what if a cyst grew in his brain again and that is why he is crying? It seems like you could possibly be having that same issue. It never hurts to call the neurosurgeon and let them know or even your pediatrician for a check up. When is your next appointment for the neurosurgeon? our apt is next week...we phoned them about something yesterday that I did not mention in this post. He seems to be clenching his fists more than we remember. They said the cranial pressure is decreasing and his body is going to go through some changes.\n\nAs far as the neck thing goes, we did not really notice it until today. We saw our pediatrician today and she was not concerned about it. They are not seizures and they are not infantile spasms. \n\nLuckily today, we noticed the fist clenching seemed to have not been as frequent as yesterday.\n\nI agree with you though, any little issue brings your worst fears to light and you think something is wrong. We were told our boy has a \"dandy walker variant\" cyst on his, I think 4th ventricle which they think was blocking the flow of CSF. They said they cant do much about the cyst right now. \n\nso many unknowns with this stuff. Best of luck to your family and your son. I am glad those symptoms stopped for him! This is anecdotal because I do not remember being 5 months old, but I think those symptoms are fairly normal. The shunt is in the neck (I think... I just have a VP shunt) and the surgery can make it quite tender and sore and painful for a little baby to move but if he can turn his head that is a good sign.\n\nIt is good to follow up with your neurosurgeon with your concerns because it is what they are there for. I hope your little man heals up quick and leads a healthy life :)\n\nIf you would like more info I can ask my parents if they noticed anything specific after my surgery - I am now 20 so clearly everything went fine My daughter had an ETV at three weeks, then a do-over at 3 months. The biggest thing we noticed is that her soft spot was ridiculously sunken in for a few days post surgery. But it evened our after a bit. My advice is to look for the signs of failure, measure the head circumference often, and do your best to just enjoy your little one without obsessively looking up too much information. I know this post is about a month old now, but I hope your appointment went well. I should have made an update, but I did not. That appointment you are referring to did not go as we would have liked. The neurosurgeon decided within 1 minute of seeing him that the ETV was not working and he would need a shunt. We were admitted later that day and he went in for a shunt the next morning. That was on Feb 23.\n\nHis recovery with the shunt went a lot smoother than his recovery from the ETV surprisingly. Right now they have the shunt programmed at a 2 of 8 which means it drains more. 1 would be max setting. His soft spot has been really sunken since they did that so its clearly working. We were concerned about how sunken it was but the neurosurgeons said it is fine.\n\nWe had a bunch of follow up appointments yesterday (endocrin, neurosurgery and nuerology). Neurosurgeons still want the setting to remain at 2 as his eyes are still not 100% looking forward. He can certainly look forward a lot more than he used to, but he still has a downward gaze sometimes. Kind of disconcerting, but like you said, enjoy the time with him as he grows up and dont look up too much info. I try to tell my wife that lol.\n\nHe just turned 5 months yesterday. Started eating real food this week and he loves it. He can almost roll from his back to his stomach so we have stopped swaddling him, but he is getting more comfortable sleeping without his swaddle.\n\nAnyway, long post...sorry! Thank you sharing your input. I will probably make a new post at some point! Do not apologize for the long post! We are all here to support each other. I am glad he got the help he needed and that it is working well.", "Advice for playing PS4 Hi my girlfriend and I both have Hydrocephalus and Hemiplegia. I am a massive gamer and have been playing games for most of my life. My girlfriend wants to be able to play games with me. She has a one handed controller but is struggling with the spatial awareness and reaction times for games such as COD and Uncharted. Does anyone have any advice for improving reactions in games for someone with hydrocephalus? I started playing single player games to begin with, getting a feeling of mechanics. Honestly I still suck at it, so I usually let my friends do the heavy lifting while I play backup. If it is an MMO, I heal and if it is a two player game I pick off enemies as a sniper or whatever How long has she been playing? Hydrocephalus on its own should not directly effect reaction time. It could be more about practice, repetition and identifying patterns. Ever since I got my VP shunt (idk what it is called I am only 14) my reaction time had been slower but not significantly slower, your gf must be In a worse situation than me but I just kept playing and it got better. There is websites where it tests your reaction time and if you practice it you will improve. Hi thanks for replying. What single player games do you play? Any recommendations to easily learn controls. I will look into setting up a sniper class for COD as well. My girlfriend has been playing tekken 7 and A couple of racing for a few months with a regular PS4 controller with the controls modified for one handed use. However she is only been using the one handed controller for a couple of weeks. Thanks for replying. I will check these out and see how we get on.

The first one hurt so bad it felt like they parked an 18 wheeler on my head and the other two were not too bad", "NICU baby with hydrocephalus This is for parents of babies with a hydrocephalus diagnosis... \n\n\nFirst off, meningitis and hydrocephalus is a mthrfcker. Excuse my language but that is how I feel. \n\n\nI need some input from parents that have had babies with bacterial meningitis that caused enlarged ventricles and subsequent hydrocephalus. \n\n\nThey say my son\u2019s hydro is obstructive and non communicative.  He has just finished his 6 week course of antibiotics for his e. Coli meningitis. CSF cultures and mri show he is clear of his infection. But mri does show a narrowing of the aqueduct and swollen ventricles. His FOC is 30cm and grows 0cm to .5cm a day.   \n\n\nHe is 70 days old born 25+4. So he is 35+4 now and 10 weeks old. He is clinically doing so well. No issues with feeds. PDA closed on its own. Gaining weight and is currently 1800g almost 4lbs. \n\n\nHe was intubated and then on cpap and then high flow of 6 for a week and then moved from high flow of 4 then to 3 in less than a week. He is currently on high flow of 3 and 21% oxygen. No As and Bs for 5 days then he had 1 two days in a row after they moved him to the flow of 3, 2 days ago. They had to put him on the flow of 2 for his MRI and because he did so well they trialed him on that after his MRI. He did not tolerate so they put him on the flow of 3.   \n\n\nNo seizures. No brain bleeds. Very active, strong, feisty, and alert during cares and holds. Has zone 2 (previously zone 1 but has improved) stage 2 ROP as of Monday and has eye exams every week.   \n\n\nThey want to do surgery on Monday because even though he is doing well clinically, his FOC is getting bigger and his fontanelle is full and he is showing some veins in his scalp. But it is not bad enough that they would do the surgery yesterday or this week even.   \n\n\nThe first neurologist we met said we could do VP shunt or ETV. Then today\u2019s neurologist said her boss (who I have not met) said they would likely do a VP shunt based on the \u201cscoring system\u201d they used with my son\u2019s stats.   \n\n\nThey have not tried spinal taps. It was never even discussed but I read about that being an option that works for others when I searched on this group. Should I push for that? Or should I push for ETV before a shunt? The doctor today said ETV could be possible, he definitely fits the criteria, but I would have to really push for it.   \n\n\nAlso, if you have gone through this already, how is your child doing? Are they neuro-typical for the most part or do they have a lot of disabilities? Did you run into a lot of failures and operations? I am thinking about requesting an actual sit down with his whole team so we can discuss this. Since his teams have changed I feel like the new doctors are not as invested in this case and are very hands off and flippant and I do not like the feeling that my son is just another number to them.   \n\n\nOur previous team would show me his imaging and go over things with me. Whereas as of recent, I have not even been shown his most recent MRI and that is after the attending said she would show me! Our last resident would call me with results or come by in person but now I have to really nag them to tell me anything and they move so slow! It took neuro 2 days after his MRI to even talk to me about surgery.   \n\n\nI want my son to have the best possible outcome with the least amount of intervention. And since they seem to think his case is not emergent I would like to take advantage of the time we have to suss out the details with the team to try and avoid a shunt (if at all possible) that will be with him his entire life and possibly give him another infection or require many revision surgeries.  I had twin boys, Lincoln and Logan, born at 23 weeks 6 days. Lincoln had a cat 4 brain bleed which caused hydro. It seemed stable, but around 155 days in the NICU he started sundowning and a VP shunt was inserted. It was like night and day, he had always been subdued and slightly cranky, after the shunt he was all smiles.\n\nLincoln is almost 2. He does have slight cp and is delayed, but his prognosis is very good. We have been lucky and no revisions have been needed. Many times it is easy to forget it exists. \n\nThe biggest issue with shunts so far is that nothing can be taken for granted. Lincoln throws up and we have to go to the emergency room to get a shunt scan. He falls down and I wince hoping that this is not the fall that breaks the shunt.\n\nSorry if this does not answer your question, but take it from someone on the other side. Life becomes normal again and the beeping eventually stops. :) Thank you. Any story with a happy helps at this point. I am glad you all are doing better &lt;3 I would definitely encourage a sit downtown with the whole team. My daughter was born at 27 weeks due to TTTS and was in the NICU for 139 days. She had grade 3 IVH and got a shunt around 30 days after being born. Honestly your sons breathing sounds incredibly strong to me. As for etv vs a shunt I think it has something to do with age and size but I am not a piediatric neurosurgeon. When my daughter got hers the mentioned something about how she was big enough to get a vp shunt and had she not been they would have had to go back later to give her one. Sitting down with a group of nurses, respiratory therapists, assorted occupational/ lactation therapists, doctors, and case workers was really helpful for us and the team in getting everyone is expectations and understanding on the same page. My daughter is a year and a half now and hasnt needed her age adjusted to track her development for a few months now. ", "Looking for suggestions I have posted quite a bit on this page about my 10 surgery journey for hydro and I am at kind of a crossroads again. A little while ago I had gone to the ER for an mri and X-ray because I have been having problems again and they said everything was fine. But it does not feel like my shunt is ok. I have been told to talk to a neurologist but do not exactly know where to start. Is there anybody on this page in the Gresham Oregon area who knows of a neurologist I can go to that will accept ohp insurance? Have you tried OHSU? I would go to them personally.  Does not your doctor have to refer you to the specialist though, so they should have someone they know of. I have not tried OHSU. But my ns has referred me to somebody and I had an appointment with them in March, but then I had and EVD surgery and had to stay in the hospital for two weeks, so I had to cancel the appointment. I would reschedule with them but my boyfriend works until about 3:30 without overtime and it takes us almost 2 hours to get to the office. Could he plan on taking a sick day for medical reasons? \n\nIt may be difficult,  but your health is really important and something that needs attended to. He could, but I also ended up losing my insurance right after my last surgery and I am currently trying to apply for it again, so it will be difficult to know when he could take a sick day. But as I wait for all of the paperwork and stuff to go through I am looking for neurologists that is are closer to me so I do not need to take an almost 3 hour round trip from my neurosurgeon\u2019s office.", "Iowa peeps? Anyone here from IA? I am trying to figure some stuff out and it would help if I talked to someone from IA I am from Wisconsin so kind of close? You okay?", "My brother was a healthy adult till age 25, until he got Hydrocephalus. (Please read and help) He moved to the US and got a meningitis vaccine, he began to get bad headaches and the doctors found a small tumor in his head which causes hydrocephalus. He is had it for 3+ yrs and I feel really bad for him. \n\nI have a few questions. \n\n1) Do vaccines really cause a disease? (Even if there is a .0000000000000001% chance) I need to know, I am not an anti-vaxer. From where I come, I have seen from second-hand experience how vaccines saved real lives. \n\n2) Does the removal of tumor end the hydrocephalus?\n\n3) What are the lesser known limitations of a person with this ailment. Like can you drive etc?\n\n\nI am sorry if these questions are stupid or long. I need to know. My brother prefers not to talk about these things. \n\nPlease talk to me. __/\\__ 4) Anyone tried the Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy? \nI heard it is a cure for Hydrocephalus. \n\nPlease respond. I was diagnosed late in life with hydrocephalus. I had an ETV to help the drainage of the excess fluid.\n\n\n1. Not really sure where you are getting at with the vaccines causing brain tumours thing. Sounds a bit far fetched and not really anything to complicate  helping your brother get through this. \n\n2. Having the tumour removed would probably also help, although also realise I am not a doctor so I cannot really say anything with certainty.\n\n3. Symptoms I had included headaches although I was hospitalised shortly after. Was all a bit quick. I am sure other people's experiences maybe different.\n\n4. An ETV just helps drain excess fluid from the brain. So yes it can help. I have an ETV for obstructive hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. Not sure it works for tumour-based hydrocephalus but it is great if you can get it to work. 1. Correlation does not equal causation. I seriously doubt the meningitis vaccine had anything to do with the brain tumor.\n2. I was diagnosed with hydrocephalus caused by a blockage of the flow of CSF; though it was not a tumor, it is the same concept. Once this was operated on, it essentially cured the hydrocephalus. Obviously, my case is not his case, but based the on limited info you gave. removal of the tumor may help the hydrocephalus along with draining of the CSF.\n3. I cannot speak for limitations of active disease as I was too young to remember, but now that it has been essentially taken care of I can drive, etc. My doctor\u2019s concerns before they knew for sure how I was going to recover were whether or not I would have peripheral vision. Should I have had damaged eyesight, I would not have been able to drive. Limitations are entirely dependent on the person,  though given more information I may be able to help you. Now, I do have brain damage from the operation but due to neural plasticity my brain essentially rewired itself and I have no discernible limitations.\n4. I did not have that done, so I cannot give my insight, sorry. :(\n\nSend my well-wishes to your brother, I hope he can get it taken care of like I did. I do hope it turns out to only be obstructive hydrocephalus as that tends to have a better prognosis once operated upon. I have a shunt that stopped functioning and it was not even a problem since the underlying problem was \u201cfixed\u201d and CSF was able to flow. He can drive, ride motorcycles, and live a very normal life...but it all depends on your brothers' doctors and how they feel about his capabilities.  For example, I am partially blind in my right eye due to symptoms caused by a benign tumour in the brain, therefore after my shunt was put in I required a doctors note from an eye specialist stating my vision is sufficient before receiving a standard drivers license. \n\nI would not worry too much about the vaccine stuff...one of the largest social experiments ever conducted is vaccine treatment, by far and large they are beneficial with virtually no side effects.\n\nRemoval of tumour is based on where it is located / danger to the patient / growth rate etc etc. THERE IS NO SAFE SURGERY so if it aint broke then do not try to fix it. Thanks a lot friend. You have given me a lot of strength. \n\nI am in your debt. I wish good things on you. \nI hope things work out for us. Are you cured now? From what I have read ETV can cite hydrocephalus while other treatments like shunts/meds help manage it. Did your ETV cure your Hydrocephalus? Thanks a lot of replying. Thanks a lot for replying. \n\nIts such a hard thing to watch someone suffer. I wish surgery was not so risky. \n\nThanks for the perspective. Yea, what he has going for his is that the techniques, procedure, and equipment have come a long way over the past 20 years.  I used to lay in a CT scanner for 45-60 min, then MRI came along and in 15min I am done. Vaccines do not cause hydrocephalus\n\nTumor removal may help.  An etv or shunt can help \n\nMost people with hydro live very normal lives It can, but sometimes the ETF closes up and another op is done.  Same with a shunt.  \n\nI have got a friend who was born with hydro, she has a shunt, its been  revised twice, and she had two healthy kids,a great marriage,  and a great job.  \n\nI think you are doing what psychologists called catastrophizing.   Hydro is not a death sentence Etv surgey is not that risky, nor is shunting Glad to help! Cure might be giving it more credit than is due, but it is supposedly a more reliable method, yes.  But it is only good for certain types of hydrocephalus as well, and it can still fail, though the chances are lower than with a shunt.  Some people can go their whole lives on one shunt, after all. So far yes. Although need to have check ups yearly to make sure the hole does not close up. After 6 years I will know for sure. Yeah I agree. If it is not treated it can be fatal. But when treated you can lead a normal life. Hey. In my case I am untreated.  Basically born with a narrow aqueduct,  had hydro, but then it arrested and stabilized.   No one knew I had it till I was 28, and no operation because I am stable , just regular MRI's Oh. So the surgery needs to be repeated at periodic intervals? I have heard that shunts require multiple operations. That is kind of scary when you think about it. There is no cure for hydrocephalus.  I wish there was. There is treatment.  \n\nIt is  possible his hydrocephalus will dissolve with the removal of the tumor,  but more than likely he will need a shunt.\n\nETVs and shunts have basically the exact rate of failure overall.  Shunt is the  easier of the two operations.  \n\nGood luck to your brother. 1. I have never heard of a vaccine causing hydrocephalus until now, and considering it is a tumor, and not meningitis (which can cause hydrocephalus) then I doubt it had anything to do with it. \n\n2. I have never heard of someone is hydrocephalus going away from having a tumor removed, but I have met other people (on fb) whose hydrocephalus was caused this way. \n\n3. It depends on the person. I personally do not drive (m33). Things kept on getting in the way of learning when I was younger, and do to ongoing health issues that has to do with hydrocephalus I do not feel safe trying for now. As long as he feels safe doing it, does not have seizures, and his doctors those disapprove of it there should not be a problem. What kind of alements have you heard of? I can fill you in with some common ones that you have missed. Personally for me, the ones that are not obvious are nvld and memory issues. Most of my others has to do with being diagnosed late, and those are not all considered normal.\n\n\n4. No, it is another treatment, and there is a chance that it would not be recommended or even work for him. But there are people who have had much better luck with ETVs than shunts. Yeah, for sure, but as long as you know the signs it is fairly ok.  I have had 7 revisions on mine but that seems to be more my case in putting out a lot of material in the CSF that can block the shunt, others do not have that issue as shown from the other cases discussed here.  Whatever treatment is proposed, have faith in the doctors that they know what they are doing though, hopefully all will turn out. It only needs to be repeated if they find it has closed up. If after 6 years it is still open then I should be ok. First, if your brother has been diagnosed and has had a tumor in his brain for 3 yrs along with the diagnosis of Hydrocephalus and the Neurosurgeon has chosen not do surgery, there is most likely a reason and it is probably because the tumo is NOT malignant and not causing what the neurosurgeon deems as issues to remove the tumor. Apparently the tumor is not malignant.\n\nThe myth that vaccines cause issues like you asked are just that...a myth. Of course you will have anti-vaxxers that will differ with this opinion.\n\nThere is thousands/maybe millions of people who are unaware that they have Hydrocephalus. Many adults have been diagnosed with Hydrocephalus due to the technology known as CT-scans &amp; MRI's. Prior to that, many patients went undiagnosed and asymptomatic as well.\n\nShunts \"can\" require multiple revision surgeries...and it is different for every person. I know several people who were shunted as children and have only had to have revisions as they grew, but now as an adult, none of these people have had have had further surgeries...and again, this varies from person to person. \n\nHaving revisions are not that bad.Sure, it requires some recovery time, but I can think of worse surgeries to have \n\nI have had 29 revisions and my Hydrocephalus issues are not typical, so for me to tell you things would not be fair. I am someone that has had quite a few issues over the years.\n\nI truly believe that if you are asymptomatic I suggest you leave well enough alone. As the old saying goes, \"IF it are not BROKE, do not FIX IT.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor someone like your brother, I doubt that hydrocephalus is going to suddenly become a huge medical issue for him. He is probably had Hydrocephalus for a number of years and the tumor as well. \n\nMy neuorosurgeons said that at the time I was diagnosed they had NEVER seen a patient with the size of my enlarged ventricles that I have....most people with the ventricles size I have are taken care of by care-givers/family members....which is RARE.\n\nYour brother and millions of other people who have hydrocephalus can and do lead productive lives. Many go to college, have degrees, marry have families etc. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Nursing. I have 4 children and have been married for years. I drive and do pretty much anything I want. I do not like boats or heights...but this has NOTHING to do with my diagnosis of Hydrocephalus.\n\n   Lastly, I am mildly curious as to why you, and not your brother is so concerned? Has he given you and your family false information and has possibly done so in an attempt to make you and other family/friends feel sorry for him? Honestly, if he is working and possibly having a few headaches, it is not a big deal. Most hydrocephalus patients have headaches from time to time...it is our new \"normal\".\n\nIF you have further questions....feel free. Most neurosurgeons who do shunt surgeries do 100's of them a month....it is not THAT risky...ALL surgeries have risks, but very few shunt patients DIE from complications due to placing a shunt.\n\nDid you look up any information about shunts? The first shunt was made by a man for his shunt who was born with Hydrocephalus by the name of Holter, thus the name of the shunt was called a \"Holter\" device. The man that developed and made the shunt for his son, had no medical expertise. This was made for his son in the 1950's :  \n(\n\nHolter's son was born in 1955. Casey Holter died, but Mr. Holter went on to make another shunt which saved another child, etc.\n\nHere is a lot of information about the different types of shunts nowadays. There is more than just the VP Shunt available today. This info is from the Hydrocephalus Association : \n\n(\n\nThis is what a Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt looks like within the brain :\n\nThere is a lot of information out there online. For patients and families often more information can overwhelm a person so it is best to leave things in your doctors hands. Honestly people do live productive lives with Hydrocephalus for the most part. 45-60 minutes in a CT-scanner? I have had my shunt (it was placed when I was an adult for 35 yrs and I have never been in a CT-scanner for 45-60 minutes....ever. How or why would a tech leave you in a CT scanner for that long? While they read the scans or had to re-do the scans would be a reason, but to scan someone THAT long? Hardly. Yea.  I do not know.  I have a benign tumour in one of my ventricles, maybe they were scanning in other locations looking for other possible tumours. Hey... coming across this comment because my grandmother has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus after a lengthy period of trying determine what was wrong with her. She is in her mid 70s and her walking had become extremely slow shuffling and imbalance and she is had some other problems with hand control and movement and mental sharpness. They did a spinal tap to test the response to draining the fluid, and she was immediately much better, so then they recommended she get a shunt.\n\nI have to ask her and her doctors specifically, but I am wondering why they did not choose to do ETV instead. Based on my reading it seems ETV might produce better results and without having a device and tubing in your body. Do you know of a reason why they would go with a shunt over ETV? I think with an ETV there is a chance that it may not work. In my case the drs said try this first and if all is well then we will leave it at that. If the ETV failed then they would do a shunt.", "Help! VP Shunt making me constipated? I was shunted last September and have dealt with really bad constipation ever since. Has anyone else experienced anything similar or is it just me? Yes absolutely. If you go on the hydro association fb page you will find that is a super common occurrence. I got shunted for the first time in 2019 and I was constipated for over a year. Side stabs + Metamucil + water + miralax + 20 min walking a day and I managed. It gets better but it takes an long time and you have to try to be patient. (I also drink green juice everyday.) \n\nYou know your body best and if something seems more off than what I am saying the best is to just explain this concern to your doctor and trust your instinct. \n\nWish you the best of luck. We are all in this together.\n\nEdit: also probiotics, prunes, veggies My son's shut actually failed due to constipation. He was so full of poop it stopped the shunt from draining properly.\n\nWe did not find him for over 24 hours (He is an adult). That one cost him a solid two weeks in the hospital plus a couple weeks in rehab after.\n\nKeep track of your poop and do not let it get extreme! Great advice - thank you! Oh wow! Hope he is doing better. Thanks for the heads up.", "Seasonal settings changes Has anyone had to get settings changes on their shunts done seasonally? For example spring/summer setting change and fall/winter settings change? I live in Myrtle Beach and the season fluctuate drastically. The pressure change is pretty evident with the seasons. I feel like I may need to get a settings change. I do not think there is any proof to that theory. A Dr will not adjust your shunt on the season but you could ask. Funny thing. My doctor agreed and did. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That is good! But are you sure it is seasonal and not overdraining?", "What cannot you do? Is there anything you have found or been told that you cannot do because of your hydrocephalus? I understand rollercoasters/rides that cause g force ( basically any good ones) can potentially cause problems and I believing diving (if deep enough) could also be a problem. I am not a huge roller coaster fan but the ones I have been on I have no issues. Keep in mind I do not think I have been on one since I got my programmable shunt. I know people have been said they have been told no scuba diving with a programmable. Personally, I have been refused as being a bone marrow donor. They could not give me a reason why but they do not accept anyone with a history of brain surgery. Also not sure if it is related or just a coincidence I usually set off the alarm in Logan airport and have to have a pat down. Most other airports I have been fine in. Used to skate a lot more, bmx, and paintball. Now I still skate, but do not try to do tricks, just transport. I also rock climb and surf which is super fun. Way more things you CAN do than things you cannot. It is been awhile but I have not had any issues with rollercoasters.  I am pretty sensitive to pressure when diving.  The pain was unbearable for me around 15 feet down.  I was not \"diving\" but snorkeling with flippers. Flying is always a challenge for me. The pressure in my head gives me symptoms of a malfunction. But I just try to sleep through the plane ride. \n Also, when I was in middle school I had my doctor refuse to sign my release form for football. I always tell people I have a pretty normal life other than the headaches and long doctor visits. My daughter has hydrocephalus, and was treated with ETV last year. It is not known how long she was untreated, but she went to Disney with no side effects six months previous to her surgery. She is only been told not to scuba dive but she is not that bothered. I have an ETV and was told there was really nothing I should not do.  When I had a shunt, they said heavy contact sports (e.g. gridiron football, rugby) were not recommended but those devices are pretty sturdy. Heights and ladders are my problems I had to think about this for a couple days. The only thing that I have ever had doctor's orders to not do was contact sports. But the thing I literally cannot to, or would need tons of practice first is stuff that has to do with fine motor skills, especially tieing knots. I was dx'd late I have very poor motor skills, and a speech inpedement because of that. I have basically been told that I could do pretty much anything. I have been told that I should avoid getting hit in the abdomen though. I have also asked about weightlifting, and the doctor told me to avoid movements where the neck is being pulled. \n\nOn that note, is there anyone who does any kind of weight lifting or strength training? What is the heaviest you have lifted without any problem? You can pretty much lift as heavy as you want. Worked in construction for years and keen into bodybuilding for about 6months now. Sometimes I might get light headed if I am doing really heavy squats for to long. ( It will always pass after a few minutes) \nEveryones different though, go at your own pace and find what works for you.", "Any VA Shunts out there? My daughter just had to have her shunt converted from VP to a VA. Wondering if anyone has one and what kinds of issues (if any) you might have had. Thanks! My son originally had a VP, then almost a year ago had to switch to a VA. No problems or complications yet besides a shunt malfunction. I was super nervous to switch him to VA too but we had no choice. We had no choice either. This was the second pseudocyst she developed in her abdomen. \ud83d\ude12 My son developed a pseudocyst as well. It was after a bowel obstruction surgery. They said they could but the VP back in but chances were very high we would be back with another pseudocyst in a couple months. 35 year old male here.  I switched from a VP to VA shunt two years ago and it is been no difference.  I ride my bike quite a bit and have not had any issues. Thanks! It just sounds scarier to have it in the heart! I will admit, I was not thrilled about the prospect either at the time.  With there being less distance to travel, I think it is a better option to some degree since there is less tubing to potentially break or shift around in weird ways.  Also, it was way better than needing to have my abdomen drained every month which was why I was switched.", "Has Anyone Had A Spinal Tap? I have been having headaches and gait changes with my Hydrocephalus. My neurosurgeon brought up a spinal tap to test pressure. This is after CT to assure my VP shunt is working. Curious to if anyone has had one and what was the procedure like? My son has had a few. He is 4. He was sedated for one and awake for the other. Recovery was quick. I hope they sedated me haha. My anxiety cannot. Thank you so much for your input.  Mine HURT!!! I could not walk and I slept allot but I think the sleep part is because my shunt is broken shattered and clogged I have had two epidurals before awake and they were pure hell. Honestly thinking about refusing if it is not under anesthesia. ", "Is this experience normal? Hello I am 17 years old and will be 18 next month. I believe I was less then a year old when I got diagnosed with hydrocephalus.  I however do not have a shunt. Throughout nearly my whole life I have had ADHD and autism as well. When I was 11 I got diagnosed with scoliosis.  Anyways, what I am trying to say is that my life has been somewhat normal-ish so far and I am wondering if it is common to go your entire life without needing a shunt or if I will need one later on. \n\nHowever, recently (around a year) I have been having memory issues and have been urinating more often then usual.\n\n\nNote that my doctor suspects I may have neurofibromatosis as well and I am being tested for that soon Memory issues and incontinence are known to be associated with hydrocephalus. I did not have any operations after my initial shunt placement until I turned 35. Then it broke and they had to do 3 brain surgeries back to back and now I have 2 new programmable shunts. You never know what you will need or when unfortunately. Best of luck to you. I am just concerned because prior to about 6 months ago my memory was like a tank and I never forgot things\n\nNote that when I said prior to a year ago in OP I was referring to urinating more often May i ask why your doctor suspects you could have NF? If a test turns out you have it they may do an MRI of your spine / pelvis to see if there are any neurofibromas there - they could play a role in your change in urinating. (Of course if you get the MRI you may have to get your shunt checked afterwards if its a programmable one) He thinks I have it because I have a decently sized flat light brown spot on my skin under my armpit.  I also do not have a shunt so I cannot get it checked. \n\nAnother reason he thinks I have it is because I have ADHD Oh sorry, i did not read carefully enougth that part about your non-exsiting shunt.\n\nWell, what i would recommend you to have your eyes checked, especially for papillidema and if available let them do an OCT scan. It could help to determine if you hydrocephalus is more active then the doctors may think. Ventricles often do not change even when the pressure rises - at least it may take a while till you can see changes on an MRI.", "Legal question!? About me. Please read 4 years ago I found out I had a brain tumor (3cm in the 4th ventricle)  and I needed brain surgery.  I had 30% chances of surviving, most likely I was going to be handicapped.  I thought I was as good as dead. I did research and based on that I could expire any second now. I was afraid of dying in my sleep. \nThen I remember that 3 years before this I had this incident where I went to the hospital and they scanned my head. The dr dismissed my visit with a panic attack and told me to go home. (I still have this paper)\nWith shame I never told anyone about this. \nThis dr saw choose to keep my tumor a secret. (Tumor was like 1\n5cm in my 4th ventricle) \nI went to get a power of attorney so in case I miraculously survived and was in a ventilator like the dr said I might me, instead they could possibly sooner than later work something to plug the cord. \nI went for the surgery and my life was saved, but I am not the same person, I need help and people dont even seem to see it since I look like a normal person. Others dont even believe I had 9 brain surgeries since after the surgery I had to have a shunt due to the scar tissue etc. I stopped telling people i even had 1 brain surgery.  \nMy friend believes this is gross malpractice and even though I am in Illinois there is something that can be done. /r/legaladvice is probably your best bet for help. Thanks", "Information Hi there! I have just found this sub and thought I would ask you about your experiences with the big H.\n\nI have congenital hydrocephalus which had been managed by a mixture of VPerotenial and VPlural shunts.\n\nMy last revision was 1990 while I was in primary school (6 revisions) and now, 26 years later, I feel no ill effects. \n\nFrom reading this sub it seems that it is quite a common problem - but I have only ever met one other person with the condition. \n\nWith each year that passes and as my responsibilities grow (married 12 years with 2 kids - 2.5 and 1, mortgage and business to run) it strikes me that perhaps I am on borrowed time. That eventually a blockage or breakage will occur and I will be in a world of hurt (financially and physically!) The last time I was out of action for 5 months!\n\nI am interested in getting in touch with others who have the condition and perhaps have more modern experience with shunts etc. \n\nHas anyone ever 'grown out' of your H? I am thirsty for knowledge!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "To those on this subreddit with Hydrocephalus: what else do you have to deal with as a result of your Hydrocephalus? As an individual with nothing other than Hydrocephalus and yet painfully aware of the privileged position I hold within the community, I would like to hear what are some things people with Hydrocephalus have to deal with. This is in an effort to be a better advocate for those within the Hydrocephalus community who cannot as easily explain what it is and its effect on those who have it. My parents treat me like I am a very fragile piece of China. I have had to have three shunt in my head. I have relearned to walk... twice. People I know get all panicky and bombard me with questions if I happen to fall. I have more anxiety about any symptoms I get.  I missed a crap ton of periods which means a  heavy flow. People pity me rather than empathize with me.  People drastically underestimate me. I have extremely bad daily migraines, life threatening epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and vision issues. I am lucky in that I have only had to have one revision but my seizures scare the $#!+ out of everyone. I believe my biggest issues are still to this day motor skills, speech delay, and balance. All of which are symtoms of Dandy Walker Syndrome as a result of Hydrocephalus. At least that is always how I have understood it. I may do tasks in a different order then others or perform tasks in a way that is unconventional to others. Also, there are times I know what I want to say but may stumble my words a little. The biggest one however has always been poor balance. Trying to stand on one leg is virtually impossible for me and sometimes I have a hard time walking innately straight lone for long periods. All in all I feel like I function rarely well for some one who lives with hydrocephalus. Although sometimes I feel like the general public my find it comical or work places using it against people with similar conditions. I feel we can still do the work. Just in a different way and it may take a little longer to figure things out. My 9 month old daughter has hydrocephalus. Any advice for parents on how to better support a daughter with hydrocephalus while growing up? Try to treat her like she does not have hydrocephalus or any illness for that matter. There are things she cannot do,but few and far between. She can do almost everything anyone else can. Above all,make sure she knows she is not alone and that she is loved. Having chronic illness of any kind can feel very lonely,or like no one understands/gets you. Make sure as she grows that she has access to online hydrocephalus groups. It has been very helpful to me personally, and think those of us with the condition need to see that we truly are not alone in the fight. Thanks for the advice and sharing. I will definitely keep your advice in mind for the upcoming years. Hope you are doing well and thanks again,! No problem! - Headaches...constant pressure within the whole skull, as well as more localized pains such as a hammer to the back where it meets the spine. This affects me enough that it is impossible to hold a job as the pressure can become overwhelming in an instant and I can be mid-conversation and then nearly on the ground doubled over screaming in pain with zero warning. The last job I had (in 2010), I had at least a dozen instances of an attack like this happening while at work...no job can endure that kind of unpredictability.\n\n- I am perpetually aware of the newest shunt I had inserted in '03 (I feel the under side touching the surface it rests on, as well as a 'tightness' in the skin over top of it).\n\n- The placement of that shunt is also in such a spot that I am forced to sleep on my left side or with my head turned 90 degrees to the left if I try to lay on my back, otherwise the entire weight of my skull pushes directly onto the reservoir (that I was told to never put pressure on).\n\n- My patience for needless bullshit is less than nil. I am in too much pain to put up with anything that does not directly lead to accomplishing whatever I am trying to get done at a given moment.\n\n- Growing up, I was treated like a piece of glass and was never allowed to be involved in any sport that was remotely physical and my parents always pushed that any time I tried something new to \"make sure they know about your shunt\" which just caused them to treat me differently and also made me incredibly isolated and a loner as kids always looked at me like I was some kind of a weirdo. I have headaches 365 days a year so theres that. I have meds, but they dont always help. I also have IBS the shunt tube is in my stomach muscle so i dont know if its directly or indirectly the reason as that is where the csf drains. The rest of my ailments are age related arthritis, bone spurs, memory, but all in all it could be worse im still able to function and be self sufficient. I hate magnets and the fact that people do not seem to take it seriously that my shunt setting can be changed by them. Alot of other things suck, like the constant fear of any kind of symptoms or the need to explain it to people and then them forgetting, but having a programmable valve is hands-down the biggest hindrance on my daily life.", "Hydrocephalus as part of L1 syndrome Hi all,\nOur son was born with hydrocephalus about a month ago. After meeting with geneticists, we are thinking that it may be part of L1 syndrome or L1cam. Does anyone have any experience with this diagnosis? We have read up on it and we are a little concerned about the long term prognosis. Speaking towards the hydrocephalus aspect of his diagnosis there should be no majors concerns about his development being limuted  or his long term health. I have no experience with the L1 aspect though. I am a parent of a child who has hydrocephalus steaming from IVH due to prematurity.", "Social Anxiety I had hydrocephalus as a result from the removal of a benign brain tumor. \n\nEver since having a vp shunt surgically placed, I have had severe social anxiety to were I cannot even hangout with my friends. I had to miss all of last year  for recovery, as I still have double vision (as a result of the hydrocephalus). What can I do?\n\nI am so self-conscious, and feel like I am a ghost and missed out on everything ... I just do not know what to do. I am with you. I had an arachnoid cyst in the posterior fossa portion of my brain. Ended up having a VP shunt placed after many complications. Feel free to message me, as we sound pretty similar! Hey, I have this too. It is not so bad as you describe. I had a brain bleed and the blood on the brain can lead to paranoia and social anxiety. It may be you have some old blood up there causing you problems. \n\nBut from experience, the best thing to do is see people one on one to start with. Doing things that make you feel calm. For me it was feeding ducks with my best friend in the sunshine. And just for an hour or so. They were really supportive and helped me slowly get back to some kind of normal. \n\nI still have horrific anxiety but I just tell myself it is the blood not me. You just have to tell your brain who is boss.", "Should I be worried? So I just had my last shunt revision 3 weeks ago now which makes 10 surgeries since August 2018. I have not had anymore malfunction symptoms but the more I sleep on the side with my shunt- my right side- the more my head starts hurting and puts me back to sleep. Has this happened to anybody else or should I talk to my ns/neurologist about it? Never had it happen when I had a shunt (Had it revised 7 times, now have ETV), but I would check in with a doctor about it.  Not sure on the system you are in, but you could even start by seeing your GP if its easier to get an appointment there and see if there is a need to go up the chain.  Hoping the best for you!  I am four weeks from my last surgery and hoping all goes well myself. To add to this, never be afraid to call and ask your doctors about insurance over the phone. Plans do change and it is complicated enough that the medical office generally have someone on staff or someone they can link you to to get you pointed in the right direction. It is much better to call and find out you need to set up a prior appointment than, set one up, wait done span of time, only to find out you did not go through the right procedure to get treatment. I have my next post op in a few weeks, I have had 10 surgeries since August 2018 and I have had several different types of shunts placed including a week and a half stay for an EVD. My current shunt is a medium pressure anti-siphon shunt and it seems to be working other than waking up with headaches (which started happening after my first revision in August). I have talked about the headaches in the past but they brushed it off because it is not a malfunction headache. They have told me to talk to a neurologist about it but I cannot get in until September. I am just curious if anybody else has had this happen and how they have felt with it. Thanks for the advice Are you me??? My head hurts when I sleep on the side with my shunt as well. I had mine placed in March. I was diagnosed this year and I am 28. My neurosurgeon told me the same about my headaches. \u201cGo see a neurologist bc your shunt is working properly.\u201d But, I have tried every migraine med in the freaking world, narcotics, Botox, dry needling, massage therapy, etc nothing has worked. I finally quit going to pain management and stopped all of my meds. I have actually turned to some self treatment. Cannabis did not help. CBD made me sick as hell.", "What are the upgrades: Vp shunt vs older shunts My shunt is 30 years old, I am curious as to what the new VP shunts do compared to mine. I will jump in here too as a curious party. My current shunt just hit the 20-year mark in August. Last I heard, shunts from that era were only expected to last about 20 years. The technology has not changed much. There are programmable ones, but as far as I can tell they do not really go that route unless it is necessary. If you have not had a problem in 30 years chances a neurosurgeon is not going to change anything. They do put barium on the tubing now. It helps them to show up on scans better. The new ones can make very incremental changes. I thought this as well but my shunt is 30 years old, I just had an MRI and the neurologist said my shunt is draining well, no need to worry. Thanks. Thanks. My first one lasted over 20 years and was broken for the last couple of them. My advice is if your having problems, get it throughly checked (shunt study with the nuclear shit in it). I was miserable for years because my shunt barely worked and scans did not show anything concerning (because the shunt was just barely working). Since then I have had another failure, I hope this one lasts 20 years. Mine is made by Ferrari - has a v4 engine and is really sexy looking. \n\nJust Joslin. No real difference to my knowledge, consistent with what everyone else is sayin Haha.  Truth be told, I am jealous everyone with VP can tell people that their half human, half machine. Absolutely.  I second this.  \n\nIn fact I have an open invitation for MRI scans, my Neurosurgeon says to come in if I ever take a blow to the head, or feel headaches that are not normal ( Canada)\n\nMy family had to move from a rural town of 5000ppl - Clearwater BC, to the city- Vancouver BC, just so I could be closer to Children\u2019s hospitals for what ended up being several shunt revisions.   \n\nMy doctor are very sympathetic to what I have gone through,  even today30 years stable condition, they still treat me like gold. I am thankful. Mine is 36 no problems that I know of. It is a Holter. It is a silver lining to have that one liner at dinner parties I guess lol Smaller, lower profile My daughter has a conventional shunt, so non programmable, it is almost the same as it is been for ages just a little smaller Thanks. Ah interesting.   My valve does stick out a bit, but it is not a problem whatsoever. I recently got a new valve that is programmable and its is SMALL compared to my old one I got in the 1990's. Thanks. Good to know. Congrats on having the same shunt for 30 years! WOW! The biggest change is the invention of programmable shunts. Another advancement in the past 30 years would be the ETV surgery that makes shunts not needed for some people. I know eh?  I have gone to bed many nights, hundreds/thousands of nights in a row wondering when my shunt will need replacement.  \n\nPost surgery trauma is real, but on the plus side I have nothing but positive results from every MRI scan. Hey! My shunt turned 30 this month too! 1990 was a shit of a year was not it. Well actually 2020 was not much better ;)\n\nI have come to the conclusion that either I have outgrown the need for a shunt  -  or I have a ticking timebomb in my head. Every morning I wake up and contemplate this. Ah.  Go get it checked, I was a bit surprised to hear that my shunt is 100% functioning, that I do in fact still need it, and no symptoms indicating I will ever need it replaced.  \n\nI too thought that perhaps it had stopped working, that I was doing well without it, neurosurgeon laughed- I need fluid drained from my brain and there is no other way to do it. \n\nThat Billboard chart is a classic! Thanks for the laughs.\n\nI last saw someone in 2015 when I had unexplained pains around the shunt tract along with headaches. My old neuro had retired and the one I was referred to basically said - without vomiting nothing could be done. I did have my first ever MRI - by there was nothing to report.\n\nNow off to listen to the B52s. It is a little old place called the Love Shack. \n\nDepends what your shunt is for, shunts typically  treat an underlying issue.  For me, I have Tectal Glioma..tiny tumour in one ventricle blocking fluid drainage.  So for me, a shunt is required to live, whereas I have heard of others who grew up with a shunt that was no longer function( not fact checked) \n\nAnyway, stay gold pony boy.", "How much emphasis on hydro headaches being positional is too much? My NP puts a strong emphasis on whether headaches are positional before considering adjusting my shunt/ treating me. I have had my shunt since Jan 27 2021, and I still feel like I know nothing about my condition, I am not confident about my symptoms being attributed to hydrocephalus. I had hydro for over 6 months in a severe way that caused un-shunted slit ventricles, and during that time my headaches were all the time, no matter if I was upright or laying down. I had all the symptoms of untreated hydrocephalus. \n\n(\n\nNow, I have been adjusted multiple times since then and still have debilitating headaches but thankfully not at the same pain level as before. I have had positional headaches on and off since then. It feels like the same sensation as when I had an LP before, the spinal headache before a blood patch, as if gravity was trying to force my spine out of my body, just not to the same pain levels as what I felt after the actual LP. \n\nSince my last adjustment in June I have not felt a lot of relief. My headaches are almost all the time, and sometimes not positional. I have had pain along my shunt line including where it goes into my head, and during those time my gait, brain fog, memory, and understanding of anything going on around me is acutely worse. I thought it was because of the weather, as my hydro symptoms come back/get worse when it is stormy and the atmosphere has been unstable since June, but I also now feel the same on sunny days too. My symptoms get worse in cycles every few days. Sometimes my shunt feels like it is not working as well as it should, the only way I know how to describe it is that it feels sticky inside. I have had a shuntogram but not the one where they inject dye into the shunt, my NP wants to avoid that if possible because it is invasive. The shuntogram seemed normal but the radiologist could not tell if the ending of the tube went into my peritoneal cavity or not due to gas. \n\nI called my NP last week saying I thought I was having problems with the shunt, when she called me back I was in the car and having symptoms, therefore experiencing cognitive issues, so that made communicating difficult and I ended up not being as thorough with my symptoms as I wanted, only getting out that I was not sure if my headaches were positional all the time, but they are sometimes. :/ She wants me to keep a headache journal for the next two weeks and then get back to her and she will help determine if it is all because of hydro. She seems to put a lot of emphasis on the headaches being positional, and does not seem to attribute the rest of my reoccurrence of hydro symptoms as being due to hydro. It is all very confusing for me, I am not confident in my ability to communicate what I am going through anymore, and it is really stressful.\n\nPart of my problem is that I am in tx where covid is overwhelming the hospitals, so I want to avoid my condition getting worse and needing the ER. Another thing is that my surgeon team is in Houston so a lot of communication is sub-par over the phone, and she only wants me coming down there for adjustments or surgical interventions because the hospitals there are even more overwhelmed than my city. I can get down there no problem, but this uncertainty about my symptoms is making the situation feel more dire. I also will not be seeing any neurologists or neurosurgeons in my city if I need a second opinion, and explaining would take up more text than needed. After an already long post. \n\nI need help figuring out what to do from here, waiting another 2 weeks and documenting headaches that are barely relieved by anything is almost unbearable, and my memory issues are already getting in the way of keeping the record. Can anyone advise? I feel so lost I have had hydro since birth. (I am a 36m BTW ) I originally had a non programmable vp shunt for 35 years but last year it failed. I now have 2 programmable shunts after having 3 brain surgeries. (I now live in Spain BTW)\n\nI have had a long hard and slow recovery. I had issues with them finding the right pressure settings etc. I lost mobility and speech so I had to go through 6 months of hard rehab and speech therapy.\n\nThankfully I am now doing better but I still have more problems with these shunts than I ever had with my old one.\n\nThsnkfully though, I am alive and mostly funci\u00f3nal. I have had great doctors here who listen to me when I complain about something (even though Spanish is not my native language)\n\nMy advice is to get a 2nd opinion. Find a doctor who will truly listen to you. You know your body better than anyone. Do not let them dismiss your pain and concerns. If you do not feel confident I do agree with getting a second opinion if you can. \n\nHaving said that, on the positional thing, I did have ICP monitoring done once for three days which showed issues only at night when I would have been laying flat for long periods. It turned out my shunt was partially blocked and would struggled when I laid down for a long time. Maybe your setting or your valve is giving you some grief and they are trying to nail it down.", "Hydrocephalus &amp; Chronic Headaches I have headaches almost daily but my family has figured out that most of them are probably from the chronic headaches which I got from my mother. Does anyone else deal with both and have a way to tell them apart? \nThanks! I have dealt with 'chronic daily head pain' since puberty.  My hydro related headaches (or at least those I attribute to it) are usually located around the reservoir. My other headaches include a jack hammer to the hard bump at the base of the skull, an overall clamping sensation and the occasional club to the head out of nowhere.   Rescue meds do not help for me, and I do not have the will to subject myself to round after round of new steroid based meds, so I have embraced medical marijuana as it at least 'turns the volume down' from a 7 to a manageable 4 or 5. Acupunture!!! Acupuncture acupuncture acupuncture \nIt is like flippin magic Thanks! fyi: it sent a wave of unreal pain coursing through my body when I tried it. I deal with both, and sometimes I cannot really differentiate between them.  \n\nLike I am not sure what the cause of my current headache is. I deal with both. I also have chronic migraine, and the thing that probably caused my hydrocephalus was a brain cyst/tumor which also the main symptom was unending headache. So I am no stranger to head pain and it all melds together after a while, but I can tell with 100% certainty when I am feeling more intense pressure in my skull it is the hydro. I have it all the time as I am pre-op for a shunt but when the pressure gets more intense it is the hydro. Like when certain weather rolls around I feel it a lot worse and it is disabling. \nI guess for you telling them apart would depend on what your current treatment for your hydrocephalus is, and if you have the pressure headaches related to hydro because it would kind of be odd for you mom to also have the pressure headaches unless she has hydro as well, does that make sense? Do you need to be able to tell the difference for treatment options or just out of curiosity? No kidding? \nI am sorry to hear it \nIt has helped me immensely. I am going to get another treatment here in an hour. I feel great afterwards and my pain comes back gradually after like 2 weeks Thanks for the info! I can never really tell either unless I start throwing up, which is why I wanted to know if anyone else had an earlier catch tactic. My mom does not have hydro, and I want to know bc when I have a bad headache, I always freak out bc I never know which type it is. I just give myself a week deadline. If the headache &lt; 5-7 days then not hydro. If the headache &gt; 5-7 days, I class as hydro. Thanks! I think I might start using that. I have also dealt with chronic headaches since puberty that has mostly been attributed to my hydrocephalus. I can tell apart what is causing my headaches by location of the headache. If it is by my reservoir or behind my eyes I believe it is typically shunt related or a migraine. If it is in the inner corners of my eyes it sinus related and taking a tylenol sinus gets rid of it right quick. If it is around my forehead it is a normal headache and I just take extra strength tylenol or excedrin. Thanks!", "Advice needed on requesting accommodations from HR Has anyone here reported their Hydrocephalus to HR at work? Did you request any accommodations if so what? I recently left an abusive employer who used my brain tumor and hydrocephalus against me. I was their golden child on track for promotion when I was diagnosed and then they gave the promotion to someone else and the reason they gave me was they did not think I was reliable because I was off work for six weeks, all of which were spent in the ICU, and it put them in a bad spot. Which yeah not ideal that I was out for six weeks but I came back and was performing at the same rate, and of course every time they mentioned it it was a verbal conversation so I had no actual solid proof to hold them accountable. Which brings in baggage to this new job. I want to start fresh and I am very proud of where I am at in my career and we pull hate for stupid hydrocephalus to derail it. My employer does not know anything about my health history and I feel like it is my information to keep but I do not want to have an issue and have it become and issue with them if that makes sense. So it may be safe to be proactive and report it to HR so that it cannot be used against me. So had anyone down this and was it helpful. I am also brainstorming if there are any reasonable accommodations I could request that would help me do my job better. Thanks This is a pretty nuanced topic. I would also suggest searching online for information regarding chronic illness in general as it pertains to your employer. You legally do not have to disclose anything. That being said needing multiple weeks off is going to cost you. It sucks, it is unfair in general, but it is going to be a fact of life unless you find a really awesome employer. My business has took a significant hit the first two years of my child\u2019s life because I was essentially away on vacation to them. They felt bad that my life was not going well, but they still needed services rendered and without me they had to turn elsewhere. \n\nI can say from personal experience that if you ever think your employer is not treating you properly that you should document everything. Dates / times / what was said. Keep a journal or a file and update it immediately. Do as much communication in writing as possible. I work in HR and have hydro resulting from a brain tumour.\nIt should not matter but it may depend where you live as to how to bring it up. I am Uk based and most employers will have a form etc re any health conditions allergies etc on hiring. Similarly if classed as a disability you would need to inform your employer if you were later likely to use that against them e.g. discriminated against for your hydro or want some sort of accommodations made.\n\nIf you are uk based you can raise a claim with ACAS / speak to them  are support. The difficulty is proving that there reason for not promoting was hydro. Try and ask for written feedback e.g. via email. \n\nCharities e.g. shine have good resources such as shunt alert cards and dealing employer information. There is no one size fits all as your symptoms will vary in nature and severity from others too. \n\nWhether I mention it at Interview for me kind of depends on if I think it is relevant e.g. justifying why currently not driving.\n\nIf I can help let me know Thank you. This is helpful insight. I am US based unfortunately When I was still working, I made a point of letting management know about my condition and what I would look like if things were going down hill (it happened a lot...to the point where I have been on disability since 2010 because it was happening so often - in the last job I had, I was there for about a year and a half and had no less than a dozen flare ups that made it impossible to stand let alone make it through a dishwashing shift). Over my working career I have not reported anything to HR regarding my hydro and I have never felt the need to as my shunt failures are typically gradual and I can function OK up to the point of final failure. \n\nI have had two rounds of revisions while working (three revisions in 2000 and two in 2012).  At the time of the first revisions I would been working at the same company for 5 years (4 years as a student, 1 year fulltime) and although the initial shunt failure was a shock to management they were fairly accommodating with time off to recover.\n\nWhen I had the second round of revisions in 2012 (still at the same company) management was fully aware of my condition and although I took a month off to recover it only cost me a few weeks sick leave (of which I had plenty saved).\n\nI am most certainly the exception to the rule as I have been extremely fortunate to have worked for the same company my entire adult career and they provide excellent PTO and sick leave benefits.", "Missed diagnosis of Hydrocephalus for 2 year little boy ", "Hydrocephalus gone? Hi, I am 31 (F) and decided to get looked at in the ER for a lump along my shunt tract on the right side; no other symptoms. \n\nI have had two VP shunts since birth; one revision on the left side. \n\nI do not have a previous history with this hospital, so no prior scans. Doctor said they found that tubing on either side was not in the ventricles, and that the ventricles were normal sized. He said there is \u201cno sign of hydrocephalus\u201d. I will be getting a second opinion, but has anyone had their hydrocephalus \u201cdisappear\u201d? I am 32F and have been told for years that I likely do not need the shunt anymore but that removing it has more potential harm than leaving it in Thanks for replying! I am hoping that is the case for me, and it is not some mix up or something. No problem, best to check with your neurosurgeon though Ok so first hello.\nSecond they have used that term on my and I am forever shunt dependent. I thought the same thing. I thought I was cured!! But when they say \u201cno hydrocephalus shown\u201d it just means that the shunt is doing it is job.\nThis disease has brought me to hell and back. I have been in comas. My heart has stopped. Ive had seizures.I have had surgeries. Seven in my entire 22 years on this planet and 3 since February. My last one was October 17th. I am not doing well with this shunt. I went last month for them to make an adjustment on my codman valve and the change worked for a bit. I have not said anything to my surgeon yet because I do not want to have to postpone my wedding again with only 3 weeks left. But I know what it is like before I have a seizure and i feel like I have time before it get deadly. Hi! They said my tubing is not even in the ventricles, even so, there are no signs of hydrocephalus. Oh! That is good maybe you are not shunt dependent anymore!!! My hydrocephalus was determined to have \u201cresolved itself\u201d\u2014 this was discovered about 10 years ago and I am still shunt-free (had the non-functioning tubing removes a few years ago because it was really calcified and painful). I know it could return at some point so I am still vigilant about monitoring my headaches, but just wanted to chime in and say it is possible, if unusual, for it to go away at least temporarily.", "Double vision?

I specially cannot focus when switching from looking at something near then far. Occasionally. I also have Nystagmus (rapid eye movement) that is constant. I guess I do not worry about it too much, I mean, I am more concerned with other medical issues that crop up occasionally with Hydrocephalus, but then too, I have been shunted since I was 30, and I am 64 now, so I really do not let too much bother me any more. Sure, I call the doctor if it persists of course.\n\nI will also add I have a constant headache that the last Neurosurgeon I have had shrug his shoulders at. My ventricles are huge due to the fact that I was not shunted until I was 30 yrs old however, this last joker of a Neurosurgeon decided to inform me my \"ventricles\" have improved. Really?

(I usually crochet)\nTake care! I took myself off of society months ago, idk how to incorporate back. \nBut what ever I do I do not want to leave the dogs. \nMaybe even train to work from home. I have double vision 24/7, but the neuro I saw in January said he sees no sign of that at all. I have had it for the longest time and I had surgery to correct it when I was 8 or 9 (I am 29 now). But it came back", "what to expect so tomorrow I get the date for my surgery. I am excited but also scared I have no idea what to expect. \n\nwhat was your experience with this surgery and what should I expect in terms of pain or anything that happens after\n\nalthough this will be my 4th surgery I only kind of remember  what happened before my last one when I was 5 and not the recovery I did not get shunted this time around, but...\n\nWhen they did my ETV, I was in the hospital for a week. Hurt like hell. They sent me home, and I was on narcotics still for a while after that. If you have strong kidneys, get them to get you some torridol, which is iv ibuprofen. Did way more for me than all the morphine they gave me. But they can only give you so much in a span of time, I think because of kidneys. They may be able to give you more, since when I needed it, I had other medications that started actually making my kidneys shut down, but that was a different surgery later on. \n\nI felt stupider for a while. That was probably all in my head, pun intended. \n\nThis may or may not apply to you, since the ETV was literally them cutting a hole, and this is placing a catheter:\n\nDepending on your condition now, after you heal, you are going to feel so much better. It is important to take it easy for a while. Do not lift heavy stuff. Do light cardio, like go for a short walk. What is going to happen, is anything where you strain is going to make you hurt, sometimes maybe not right away. I had this where if I strained, a few hours later, I would be incapacitated with pain, anywhere from a few hours to 3 days straight.\n\nThe reason why they did my ETV is they needed to take out my shunt, as it had calcified and shattered in my neck and hurt like hell, and they were not sure if I was shunt dependent or not.\n\nAnyway, I know this was not the exact answer to your question, but I know that anxiety feeling you might have right now, and I wanted to make sure you know that everything will be okay, since no one has commented as of me typing this. You are going to be okay, and this going to probably make your life so much better. thank you. it helped a bit. I know I will be ok because God will be there with me and my family too. my doctor thinks that it is calcifying and over draining. so he said he can either do it now or I can do it later when the shunt completely stops working which is soon. his words exactly. your story scared me a bit, to be honest.\n\n&amp;#x200B; This is just plumbing stuff. Yeah, it is on your brain, but it is literally just plumbing. Brains are tougher than you think.\n\nDo not freak yourself out. You will be the same person when you wake up. \n\nI am really glad, out of all the brain surgeries a person could need, that this is/was our problem. This is going to physically hurt, but you will hurt if your calcified catheter breaks, which was why mine was taken out. If you do not care about scars, I would encourage them to get as much of the calcified shunt out as possible.\n\nAlso, fun fact, I had my last two surgeries at Dell children's in Austin, and they were when I was 18, and 19, turning 20. At least you are not going to turn 20 in a children's hospital. Super awkward. I noticed your username is Texas themed so I figured I would include that I grew up in South Austin, and I commute to Texas State. So howdy, neighbor! Thank you! I turned 21 in June and I really do not care about scars I already have 2 and I have come to terms with them shaving my head because they did it a few months ago for a test I had &gt; ...literally just plumbing. Brains are tougher than you think.\n\nFantastic metaphor. Stealing this quote for my 2 year old with shunt/hydrocephalus :) If you have long hair, you can keep most of it if you make someone brush it. Then when you get your duck fluff, it will poke through your other hair. \n\nThe plumbing thing, I think was originally told to my dad when I was born, by a pediatric neurosurgeon in Atlanta. It depends on what/how much of the shunt needs replaced.  If they need to cut into your abdomen to replace the tubing down there (assuming a VP shunt) then most movement will be painful as they mess around with your abdominal muscles.  But that is just it, it is almost entirely just the incisions that hurt.  Once the correct pressure has been re-established all the brain stuff is good to go.  I just had a revision in the beginning of December 2018 and that was my experience.  Mine was a little easier because I have a VA shunt which means my shunt drains into a vein in my neck so other than a little irritation when moving my neck I was fine.\n\nTake it easy for a couple weeks after the surgery.  General anesthesia and the trauma to your body from surgery really takes it out of you and rest is about the only solution for that.\n\nBased on your comments in this thread it appears that you have a personal relationship with God.  It is such a relief to be able to cast these cares on Him and know that ultimately He is in control and will never leave your side.   I do not know if they are going to cut into my stomach i think they might though i have short hair it does not reach my shoulders You will be fine. You had your appointment, right? How did it go? I am having surgery on Valentine's day but there is pre op tests that I need to get done by the 8th I am still waiting on the email though  Hope you are feeling better! From my experience as a parent, my daughter seems to bounce back the second the anesthesia wears off. She has only had revisions to the cranial portion and is still a toddler, but I believe the pressure aspect is alleviated almost instantly.  Its getting allot worse I had to go home early today because of it and I am extremely nauseated Did you not have surgery yet?  no, I have it on February 14 Surgery was not bad. Recovery kicked my ass. \n\nI was up and off pain meds a few hours after I came out of surgery. \n\nHowever. Do not push yourself. I did and regretted it. You just had brain surgery so act accordingly haha. \n\nWeek 1-3 I could barely walk. I felt drunk. Vertigo killed me. Showering literally took every ounce of strength I had. Definitely invest in a Boppy pillow and a recliner. It is much easier setting up the first couple of weeks as I found if I laid flat the fluid made me feel like I was drowning. I used a cane a good month after surgery until my fluids leveled out. \n\nThings I found that helped:\n-bath seat: so much easier sitting down showering. \n-when washing incisions ask for a bottle of surgical scrub before you leave the hospital. Most nurses will slide you a bottle on the sly. I would mix it in a squirt bottle and gently squirt my scalp and stomach (vp shunt) in the shower and it helped tremendously. If not use antibacterial hand soap. \n-stool softeners. Surgery and the pain pills screw with your digestive tract and left face it constipation is not what you want after brain surgery \n-meal prep before surgery. Light and balanced meals you can easily reheat. Because screw cooking haha. \n-nonslip socks. You are going to walk like a drunkard for a bit afterward. \n-no bending down. It hurts. \n\nThese are some of the things that helped me. It took me a little over a month to feel \u201cnormal\u201d again. Be patient with yourself.  Thanks!! So in place of a body pillow my boyfriend bought me a giant bear and I really hope this surgery works I am sure that would be awesome. I have a huge sloth I use at time to prop myself up to sleep haha. I hope your surgery goes well. Just take it easy and do not be too hard on yourself!  ", "What type of job do you have? I have Hydrocephalus due to aquaductile stenosis \nwith a VP Shunt. I work as a welder/ machinist. I am curious what type of work do other people do who have Hydrocephalus with a shunt. If you are able to work that is. Software developer Project Manager Personal assistant/administrator English as a 2nd language teacher I work as a scrub tech on the Neuro team. Me too! :) I acquired my hydro very recently from an extreme bout of meningitis and am so scared it is affecting my cognition so I am so happy so hear about another SDE with hydro! Do you do anything to monitor your cognition + make sure it is on top-top shape regardless of the hydro? This is a field where substantial ego is involved regarding intelligence let us be real\u2026 so it can be a bit harder when the brain gets affected by outside things. I also have a little bit of slit vents. It sucks. Construction, commercial framing and drywall, training to be a foreman Accountant It never occurred to me about my hydro affecting my cognition.  I am lucky to have found a company where having ego regarding intelligence is not encouraged.  We are a team and collaborate really well.  I have had hydro since 2007 and have been in software since 2010.  The companies I have worked for have always been very supportive when I have had revisions.\n\nShoot me a DM sometime, I would love to chat. Human resources I had to go on disability around a decade ago because my chronic head pain gets so severe, so often, that in the last year I was working I was forced to bail mid shift around a dozen times while dishwashing in a corporate events setup. I just started as a city bus driver. Very cool! Congratulations! How old are you and how long have you had your shunt? I am fortunate I have not had to leave work with my headaches. 39, last one was installed in '03, the others were installed in the early 80s. I am a paralegal. I am sorry to hear that. I hope medical advancements will come along and help you get some pain relief. I am currently trying to get set up with a new neurosurgeon as my shunt is blocked and the last doctor overseeing me passed away last year. In the meantime, medical cannabis has been my salvation. Ditto to the medicinal cannabis! In addition to hydrocephalus, I have spina bifida with tethered cord syndrome and it has been a lifesaver! I was able to drop so many prescriptions and say goodbye to the horrible side effects from them! Good luck on your neuro search! I just had to get a new one too. It is daunting. Me too! Sorry to hear that. As rough as my situation can seem at times, I have to remember how lucky I have been that I have only required 5 surgeries in 40 years, and did not end up with a more complicated case. I went from 5 different meds to just weed, and also no side effects. The cause of my hydrocephalus has never been nailed down, but one possible reason is aquaductile stenosis. I am a corporate paralegal working on contracts. Very cool. Mine was brought on by a car accident at 19. I did not hit my head in the accident but after started showing symptoms. Almost a year later I was diagnosed and shunted. It was said my Hydro was so far gone I probably had it my whole life but did not present til after the accident. Nice. I got mine in '93. No revisions. Produce Clerk for a Kroger division. 14 years with Kroger, 10 in produce. Cool. My son works in prouce for a grocery store. Impressive! I cannot keep numbers in my head long enough to do that. Thanks for replying. I get confused sometimes and do not know if I could do that type of work. Awesome! I framed houses before my accident when I was 19.. Congrats on the Foreman position. WAY AWESOME! Did you learn second language before Hydrocephalus diagnosis? I learned Spanish at 27 years old (well I am 36 and still learning!) it was not easy but totally worth it to be bilingual. I am not like a native Spanish speaker but I can communicate pretty much everything I want to say. If I could go back and change anything though, I would learn Spanish at a much younger age. What did you use to learn if you do not mind me asking? I have been wanting to learn. I know a few words but not enough to really communicate with someone. That is cool. Thanks for replying. Your answer is encouraging. Inially, I took one year of Spanish in high school where I learned nothing (mostly my fault)\n\nBut I moved to Colombia in South America where Spanish is the native language. So I forced my self to learn it to survive.\n\nThen I met my wife (at first we only spoke Spanish as she did not speak English) then, I took a few proper actual classes and had private tutors in addition to studying on my own.\n\nI realize my journey to Spanish fluency is not for everyone but it is how I did it :) That Is actually pretty Cool.. I have had my struggles but overall, life's been a good ride. If you are really serious about learning Spanish the easiest way is to force yourself by moving to a Spanish speaking country or getting a partner that speaks Spanish.\n\nBarring that, there are a ton of free apps like duolingo I am a chemist/physicist, currently working in academia (at a university) as a postdoctoral research associate. Now that is amazing.. Nice! How lucrative is a scrub tech job? I am in patient care That is dope! Are you also researching for a hydrocephalus cure It depends on what service you cover and how much call you take. It also depends on what hospital you work at. On the Neuro team, you can make between $17-$20 a hour with weekend call once a month. I am not because I am not in human biology at all. I actually did a year of medical imaging and was not really a fan of human biology haha. However, I personally had two stents placed in my brain after about 200 shunt revisions and have been neurosurgery free for about 2 years now (my personal record). So I consider myself pretty much cured. I am currently struggling with some headaches but I think if you did this kind of treatment for someone who did not have a ridiculously long and convoluted background to balance that you would have a lot of success. I wow 200 revisions?! And I am glad you are okay now \nIt is a treatment more than a cure but I understand. \nI am wondering if I would be okay to move out of state for my Masters Entry Clinical Nursing. I would argue, as would the radiologists that placed them, that it is a cure as I no longer have any pressure issues and I now regulate the pressure in my brain, myself. The stents should never need to be replaced since there is no working parts and by having them there my brain is reabsorbing the CSF itself into the veins. Did you have high pressure issues like me? Thanks for the advice! My wife probably would not go for the Spanish partner..lol. I will check out duolingo. Just tried Duolingo. Pretty Cool! Thanks!! Oh cool\u2014 what kind of law do you para-legal for? When my shunt blocked I definitely had high pressure issues. With no shunt at all I would have high pressure issues too. I have a codman Certas plus valve and am having under draining symptoms again. .. wondering if stents would work for me since you mentioned them. Do you have a shunt as well as the stents ? I am a social worker That is cool. We adopted our nephew when he was 5. Went through alot of stress in his teenage years. Dealt with social workers alot. You have a tough job. Thanks! I do not do hospital social work, I am in community mental health. Very kind of you to take in your nephew. Like parenthood, social work is tough,  but rewarding. I am a night auditor and a service representative at a gym :) Thanks for responding! Of course! I just found this subreddit so I was browsing through it hence the super late response", "Keep it neat,high, and tight, and ignore the scar. ", "Diamox Has anyone with ocular pressure and facial numbness had diamox work to pull the fluid out?\n\nI was in the hospital for two days under shunt malfunction watch and after having an LP . I used Diamox for over 5 years after my shunt it helped a good bit then I developed slit ventricals apparently helped too much \ud83d\ude0c. The downside to Diamox is you feel like crap on it and it gives you an awful taste in your mouth. Nothing you eat if you can eat tastes right. However, about 15-20 min after taking it you will be peeing like crazy. Five years?! I think I had slit ventricles before . Now they are larger.\nI am only taking them for the papilledema because my cranial pressure was 21.\nMy appetite is more controlled now thanks to this diamox! I wish i had it for the appetite control lol I almost went blind and the Diamox held it off until I got a Shunt. Then I was on it for 5 years until the Shunt could get things straightened out. It was very scary I am mostly deaf only 60%  left in one ear. Very thankful for the awful medicine. Whoooooaaa! I also had a stroke (that came from an injury) that caused me to get pseudo tumor cerebri which caused the fluid on my brain that caused me to have to have the shunt. My journey all started almost 11 years ago. I have facial numbing from the stroke and Diamox causes some tingling with the hands I believe. It gets easier to not notice the longer you take it though so does the penny taste in your mouth that it gives you. They had me on Diamox and Spironolactone and Topomax. I have Seizures from the brain damage. I have migraines a lot and recently have discovered a new medication that really helps Aimovig monthly injection and Ubrevly you can take the Ubrevly up to ten times in a month. They both work amazingly!!!! For pain my doctors have found Nuycenta to work the best and not make me foggy at all. Strong as hell I tell you that. I have congenital hydrocephalus. The numbness shit gets on my nerves tho I think anyone with Hydrocephalus is strong as hell!! We push our bodies to places no one should ever have to experience.. I am always happy to talk if anyone has any questions I have been through a lot and tried a lot and have had some success. Right?!\nAlso, are you forced to work? I know SSI are assholes No I have been approved for SSDI since I had a massive  brain stem stroke. My survival rate was 3% and vegetative at best. Originally I could not walk talk or feed myself. I have come a very long way but I still am not anywhere near the person I was before all of this and I could never do my job now with a TBI. I miss working though but to be honest i am so sick most days I would have fired me if I was my boss.. U are the one and soooo inspiring!!! Thank you, I have tried to look at my entire situation as positively as I can. Do not get me wrong I have my \u201cVery Bad Days.\u201d This is not a good way to live but the alternative is much worse. I have done years of talking through this to try to handle it as best as I can. It helps to have a lot of support and to be honest having a group of peers who are going through the same thing actually helps. Sad to say but it makes you realize you are not \u201ccrazy or loosing your mind\u201d, that all of the little strange things that you have noticed are really happening &amp; that when you tell your doctors they just quickly dismiss you like it is nothing when many months down the road some miracle happens and the problem is shown through an ER visit and there shown a new direction... It is so sad because so many months of suffering could have been saved and so many months of lost time could not have happened if they would have just stopped and listened to what we were describing that it was more important than they thought.  I like to ask them if this was happening to their mother, sister, or daughter what would they do for them? Sometimes they stop and listen. Make full eye contact when you say that! It takes a cold hearted person to look you in the eyes and dismiss those types of questions especially when you are so sick and practically begging for help. If they just listen they could have helped so much faster it is sad because we are the ones that have to live this life and we all want the best life we can have! I say advocate and NEVER EVER give up on yourself!", "Anyone else have feel tired, fatigued, irritable ? Seems like ever since I have had a shunt my energy has been low, anyone else going through this? Yes same here.  I had surgery to replace my whole shunt back in february.  I was on bed rest for almost the rest of the month at home.  I became accustomed to just laying in bed watching youtube on my phone.  Now months later I feel tired almost no matter what I do how much sleep I get it does not really matter.  I do not feel motivated to do anything really and things I would normally be happy to do at work now seem like major annoyances. Interesting...my surgeries were many years ago, but I can relate.  Constant fatigue, feels like I am pushing myself through the day. \n\n While we are on the topic, maybe try this: take elemental iron.  My son was diagnosed by a pediatric sleep specialist to have low Ferritin (iron) levels.  In his blood work the level showed normal, however, the specialist wanted my son to start taking iron to see if his sleep improved, and it did. Then the specialist pointed at me and asked me to do the same,  stating the fathers side tends to be the culprit..and since I have been taking one capsule of Palafar 30mg each night with vit c, empty stomach, i have been sleeping deeper. \n\n\\*\\*Iron is fat-soluble, not water-soluble, so you must get regular blood tests to ensure you do not end up overdosing/poisoning yourself witih too much iron, but, since I started taking iron a year ago I have not come close to the limit.  Hope this helps. funny you say that about iron levels.  I also have a blood condition where my blood cells are malformed and as a result get destroyed and recycled prematurely.  This has also contributed to my overall drowsiness and lack of energy basucally my whole life.  I was told by my doctor to take an iron supplement to help replenish the lost iron through my body having to constantly replenish faulty red blood cells Costco - Palafar capsules, red pack behind the counter.  Do not get the pink pack, unless you are pregers I just had mine on Valentine's day and another on in March. I am mostly always tired but I never thought it was because of my shunt I do not know if it is the shunts fault ,  just putting it out there is all. Yea I have no idea I am still recovering. Maybe if I ask my surgeon I can find out", "6yr old son vomiting and saying his head hurts My 6 yr old son(nearly 7) has had a VP Programmable shunt since birth. A few days ago, he vomited for over 24 hours about every hour and said his head hurt. He finally made it an entire 24 hours without vomiting and went to school and made it the entire day. Believe me, if he was showing any signs of not feeling well, they would have called me. They are always trying to send him home for one reason or another.  After nearly 48 hours without any issues, he has started up again. No fever at all throughout these last 4 days. No other symptoms aside from being pretty tired most of the time. He has never vomited until this incident.\n\nIs it possible that this is shunt related? He last had a CT about 4 months ago and everything was deemed fine by his neurosurgeon.\n\n Definitely call his neurosurgeon or the neuro on call.  Call his neuro or take him to ER. Vomiting is a clear sign of a shunt malfunction. Speaking from experience, 5 revisions later. ", "Momentary hearing loss and ringing in ears Hi everyone, just a quick update. I have what is considered mild hydrocephalus but my lumbar puncture came back normal so my neurologist does not want to do surgery as of yet. He does think it is the cause of my frequent urination, weakness, and my legs acting up/buckling. He said he wants to monitor things for now (get another brain MRI in six months) and if my symptoms get worse then there will be another lumbar puncture and if surgery is required he said that he would want to do something like a spinal shunt. \n\n\nAnyways, tonight while sitting on the couch watching tv with my boyfriend, the strangest thing happened. We use air purifiers but they are in the corner of the room. My left ear had a whooshing sound similar to the air purifier. Which at first I thought was the air purifier. But then the hearing in my left ear went out completely, I got a pain near my left temple and after I had a high pitched ringing in my left ear (I am assuming is tinnitus). Then while the tinnitus was continuing a few minutes later the hearing in my left ear came back. Which made me notice the whooshing sound I heard in my ear was not exactly the same whooshing from the air purifier. Then after 10-15 minutes the tinnitus faded away. I have never experienced this before. I have had random ringing in both of my ears on and off over the years, it would only last like 30 seconds though. This seemed more intense. And I was wondering if anyone else experienced this? I am just wondering if it is something worth bringing up to my neurologist.", "question so a few days after I saw my surgeon my left eye has started twitching and sometimes it hurts or blurs my vision. I do not know if it is my actual eyeball doing something weird or if it is the muscles around my eye. makes me wonder if it is part of the sickness or stress without me knowing it. has this happened to you before? I get that every now and then. Usually I fix it by blinking. Stress could be a part of it. It is never a bad idea to ask a professional if you are really worried.  sometimes it hurts but mostly it bothers me\n\n&amp;#x200B; I think it might be stress, but you could always get it checked out if it continues for a long time.  I thought it was stress too because like I said it started after I saw him and I got the surgery date", "Anything helps ", "Waiting for a CT. Hospital lights are too bright. Unhappy camper. ", "Just had a vp shunt put in, what are some side effects you guys experienced? So im 22 and i just had a shunt put on the 15th. Ever since ive had the surgery ive had back to back issues. Two days after the shunt i had a terrible headache that just kept getting worse and worse so i went to the ER. They kept me for about 5-6 days and ran multiple tests on me and discovered that my ventricles were still enlarged and that i had some bleeding in my brain now. So they made some adjustments to the shunt setting and now i only feel comfortable if im laying down. If i sit up or try to play games or walk i get extremely dizzy, lightheaded, and i feel pins and needles in my right hand. Please any input would help, i feel helpless in this situation and i just want to feel better again. It sounds like it is a programmable shunt? If so I would go get it checked out, they may need to adjust it. My son had a VP (now has a VA) and his early shunt failure symptoms can look like that. Yeah they can put a magnet up to my head and adjust the settings. It would suck if its already failing, i dont want another surgery 10 days after my other one! I understand! My son had a BUNCH last year. Sometimes they work for a long time and other times they go through a cycle of failing. There is no rhyme or reason and it sucks! If you dont mind me asking, how old was your son when he got diagnosed with hydrocephalus? My neck hurt for a while after mine, and I had pain around the incision for a while as well, but nothing like you have mentioned.  I had a shunt for 10+ years before ETV and really never got any major issues like you experienced, so I would consult your medical professionals for further guidance and rely on emerg still if necessary.  That said, best of luck and I hope you heal well. Thank you :) and i had an etv done back in 2018 and it must of failed because my neurosurgeon said that im having a lack of CSF in the front cortex of my brain and that it would require a shunt placement. I should also mention that i was doing fine up till the 20th of june when i was drinking and fell and hit my head on a deck. So words of advice to anyone who has hydrocephalus, treat your head with care. It was at birth, he has Spina bifida and most kids with it have hydrocephalus Were you just diagnosed? Is this congenital or did your hydrocephalus have another cause?\n\nMy kid was 11, which is super old. Most kids are diagnosed as babies.\n\nHe has had a rough time but we eventually got him straighted out. It was a long process.. I was diagnosed at 19, they never really gave me a real reason to why i have the condition. They are saying it could be due to the amount of trauma my head has taken through my life up till now. Ive had 2 surgerys so far, an ETV and a shunt placement a week ago. It is a tough condition and a rough recovery, the ETV recovery was a lot easier than what im experiencing through this one so far. Im glad your kids' doing good, i wish them the best of luck and health! So you had the shunt put in on the 15th. When were you discharged from hospital?\n\nIn answer to your question: I get a lot of headaches, nausea and loss of appetite, and my right side is weaker than my left. I have a VP shunt and have no side effects or issues with it. I live my life normally. Mine was fitted at 23 and it got blocked after a year and I had a shunt revision at 24.\n\nInitially I had pain in my abdominals (where they had cut for the drainage site) and of course on the site of entry on my head. It was painful to lie down on the side where the shunt was, it kind of felt bruised all down my neck and I could only lie on one side for a couple of weeks. \n\nThe day after my surgery I felt like shit, I was vomiting, had the worst headache of my life, could barely move from the pain. But then my doctors came round and said it must be over-draining so they readjusted it (mine is programmable too) and after that I felt absolutely fine. When my first shunt became blocked about a year later, I had a searing headache, I had pins and needles in my hands and feet and lost the ability to wiggle my toes or fingers, I lost my ability to form sentences, and I was vomiting. Called an ambulance and it turns out I had a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) which is basically a mini stroke. \n\nAdvice - if you are getting headaches and/or nausea, it sounds like your shunt needs to be reprogrammed or potentially it is not working at all and you may need a revision. Look up VP shunt failure rates to be a little more informed - I did not feel like I was fully informed of how common it is for shunts to fail in the first year. Good luck xx Good Lord, let us see here: nausea, dizziness, occasional blurred vision, headaches,malaise, unbalanced, fatigue and or drowsiness\n\nHowever some of these occur only the days following surgery.  These are the ones I can remember at the moment. It sounds as though you have a shunt malfunction occuring to me,but I am no doctor. I have, however,had some experience with this type of thing,seeing as I have had 11 brain surgeries,the last one I had being in January. I had a VP shunt put in at 24. It took about 2-3 years for me and my doctors to figure it out. We had to keep adjusting it over and over again. It was not failing but I would be either over draining (cause horrible migraines, prefuse vomiting) or under draining (back to having hydro symptoms). I have had so many shunt function studies done and it seemed to be functioning properly. We finally figured out that my shunt does not drain while I am laying down, so while I am sleeping my csf builds up. I was put on acetazolamide to limit how much csf my brain produces overnight and then about a year ago I started using CBD 1000mg tincture to help with the inflammation of my brain and I would say I am close to being back to normal that I will ever be.\nIt sounds like you are overdraining. If you are okay laying down that means your shunt needs to be set at a higher setting.\nI hope you get your shunt figured out soon. I know it is a rough road but you can do it \ud83d\ude0a They released me from the hospital after one night of monitoring, i went home for 2 days and my condition got progressively worse so i went back and they kept me for 5-6 days. Im definitley experiencing the loss of appetite headache and nausea, its just these other side effects im having are worrying me. Thank you, i have an appointment with my neurologist on the 25th of August So ima have him make an adjustment then. I dont feel like mine failed though, it just feels as though it needs adjusted again, because after the first adjustment i felt 10x better than what i did Yeah it might take a little while for you to find your sweet spot to counterbalance the hydrocephalus without overdraining. Hope your next appointment comes with more success! :) Its a long journey but keep in touch with your neurosurgeon,  I have been shunted my whole life. \nWhat type of shunt do you have? That seems very soon to discharge! I appreciate that it is not your decision. Shunts can fail very quickly so I am surprised they did not observe you for longer. I would contact your neuro team if you can. I have a vp shunt the one that goes into your stomach i believe. They adjust the setting with a magnet and a dial Ok so you have a programmable shunt. I had that for two years ant it was Medtronic strata valve 2 Not sure where you are. We are in the US. He had a few medtronic shunts put in that just did not work well for him.\n\nHe got a Sophysa shunt (popular in Europe) and he has not been in the hospital since. Not sure why, but it works for him. We did that after a few years of him going downhill. \n\nWishing you the best! Mine was put in shortly after birth, and I have always had a fixed pressure shunt. I am 29 now and I have had 28 shunt revisions. I did go through a time where I had 8 shunt revisions in one year. I would go home and spend not even 24 hours at home and the shunt has already failed. I have also had to have it externalized 2 times for infections. The only sign that I have that tells me that my shunt is failing is that I have a crushing headache, irritability and sensitivity to light. Do not let them send you home when you feel like something still is not right. When I was 20 I had my first non programmable vp shunt placed and I needed a replacement within days. And then had countless complications over the next 3 months. Basically lived in the hospital. I am 22 now and my dms are completely open if I can offer any advice or a place to vent when you need it. You got this!", "Working in a restaurant I have been working at my job for a year . I work at a restaurant and they are so understanding and supportive to me. I am 4 weeks post op and have been back to work for about a week now. This last surgery they moved the valve from the back of my head to the top of my head. Today I was trying to help one of my coworkers and I took her headset. I put it on and immediately felt uncomfortable because the headset went right on top of the valve. I found a quick fix luckily I had a beanie where we keep our stuff. It helped. I am curious as to what solutions other people have came up with working with this disease or any suggestions people might have. I often tape gauze around the end of the arm of my glasses and safety glasses because they press on an area where I have had a lot of revisions and it starts to hurt. I am now looking into prescription safety glasses which will be able to be adjusted so this does not happen.\n\nI am glad your revision was successful! This is my third one this year. Hopefully this one works. I sometimes have that problem where they hurt but if I am doing headset at work because the valve is on the top of my head I get scared Kudos to you for getting back on your feet at work after 3 surgeries this year! I commend you, my friend. Although, if you did need the rest, that is so respectable too -- following your needs. How does your brain like the new shunt placement?\n\nIdk what specific solutions you may be looking for, but self-care is my #!, from super rest to clean diet. Swimming helps get movement while relieving the neck tension from scar tissue/angry nerves. Hi. Thanks. I think it is going well for the most part it is just getting used to the new placement and the incisions healing. One got infected so I am on meds for that. There is still things I cannot do at work but I try. Sometimes I get tired fast but I try to work through it. Hi. Thanks.

I have had several surgeries and am healing. Although; have tried to get into nursing but without funding- cannot do it in state.\nThere are options out of state but I would be myself.\nIs anyone into speech pathology? How is being a traveling medical professional working for you? I am not a medical professional, I am an academic, but this also has a lot of travel. It is been okay for me. I make sure I am super prepared with insurance and stuff before I go. I did end up having surgery three times in another country (Germany) once but it was all covered by my university's insurance and it was fine. How did you take care of yourself in another country? I ask because I want to get my MSN out is state but I would be by myself! \nI have had several surgeries in the last three years  I had had about 150 shunt revisions by that point so the only difference for me was the language barrier really. I guess also the hospital did things a bit differently to what I was used to but I got used to it. I had a super supportive boss there. I had thought about travelling to the UK (I am Australian) so that it would just be reciprocal health care and I would not need to worry but the professor of the group convinced me to check with the university insurance back home to see if I could go to the nearby hospital as she said it was a very good hospital. They gave me a lot of help like free taxis to and from the hospitals for surgeries and visited me a couple of times with food since I did not have family there. Hospital in Germany is a bit weird in that I could just wander out when I wanted to. I got a lot of panicked calls from my university Dept back home since they must have been told I needed support but I did not really need anything. So I just had to be awake for their calls which was kind of annoying at the time but hilarious to look back on. Wow!!!!! I am shook, I am have seven surgeries but am scared because I would be alone if something happens to me. I have looked into UCLA grad school and would have to ask about their disability support program. What ways do you think would help me succeed by myself again with hydro? I also have neuropathy here and there too. \nI have been trying to go for nursing for a couple years now. For me it was just knowing I was covered insurance wise wherever I was. Being from Australia I have never paid for anything medical ever. Like I pay for medical insurance for the dentist and glasses but I have never paid a cent for my shunt surgeries or hospital admissions or ambulances. I also lived rural for a long time and had to be transported a couple of times so there is been a lot covered by Medicare. I do not go anywhere if I am not 100% sure that I can cover the medical costs if anything happens.\n\nSchool-wise I have always been relatively okay. I missed a lot of days but managed to get through with good grades so I did not stress too much about it. I never had allowances from the schools or unis for exams or anything. I went all the way through PhD so it can definitely be done. And you have  had 100+ shunt surgeries? Including revisions on the distal shunts?! \nI am so glad you commented today because I have been like, how am I going to do this for two years ?\nI am USA so I pay for private insurance.\nCalifornia (originally from there) has Medi-Cal so I should be okay on that part. I will about the home health care if something happens\u2026\nDo you have a fb or are you apart of any groups for hydro? I would like to keep in touch with you if I may . \ud83d\ude0a I am shocked reading about those 150+ shunt revisions. Was all of them surgeries including opening your skin etc.? Yeah. 90% of them were replacing the proximal catheter and the reservoir/pump only, the rest were replacing the whole thing (including the distal catheter). So most of them they only opened my head and not my abdomen which is nice I guess? I am pretty good at rebounding from them, like I would wake up pretty much 100% better and ready to do everything, just with a little bit of wound pain. The decline into needing surgery was more of the issue. I do not know what to say...just wondering how anyone can cope with this.\n\nMay i ask why so many revisions were necessary? Did the catheter / shunt itself get clogged? Yes they were blockages. Mostly in the catheters, sometimes in the pump bits. I have slit ventricles and I assume this caused me to have more revisions than normal. What type of shunt do you have now to prevent the blockages and increased fluid? I have stents now instead of a shunt. So they found areas in my veins in my brain with narrowing and opened them with stents. Lowering the pressure in the veins causes the CSF to naturally diffuse into the vein on its own and be reabsorbed in the vascular system. My shunt had blocked well before we placed the stents so I am just using the stents now. Some people have the stents and a shunt or the stents and medications like acetazolamide. Ahhh I see, I am back on the acetazolamide as of today\nI was told today that the Codman Certas plus 2 valve is the highest drainage at 1; which is the setting I am on and I am worried!\nI see my nsg tomorrow because my last shunts did not drain enough and the one I had in March was clogged/blocked. The other option is the place a second shunt which I know is something some people do. My major shunt problem was constant blockages so it was a little different to that. I actually have no idea what brand shunts I had. Yeah they mentioned a second shunt and that it most likely will not fix the under drainage cause my ventricles are small", "1 week post op VP shunt ", "Question for women with hydrocephalus... Hi,\n\nI am an early 20\u2019s woman and I am thinking about starting a family soon but I have a nonprogrammable VP shunt that drains to my abdomen. Has anyone had experience with this? I have not reached out to my neuro team yet btw. Thanks for any insights! Following this as same shunt etc My friend with the same situation recently had a kid, it was a scheduled C-section.  Same, it had not even crossed my mind that pregnancy could be a problem for me.. 32 years old and shunted since birth. Also have a programmable VP shunt (this one is 10 years old). \n\nCurrently 24 weeks pregnant. No issues so far and none predicted. I see my neurosurgeon in a month to get his advice on the birth, but that is mostly to decide whether to deliver at my local hospital or one with a neurosurg team just in case. Natural birth with spontaneous labour is the plan for now. \n\nThis is my first so I cannot provide much guidance for now, but feel free to ask any questions that I might be able to answer until someone with more experience comes along. A shunt infection means I have had a laparomoty ( vertical scar from belly button to bottom of stomache ) so not sure if c section would be an option  for me ?\n\nI have heard sometimes pregnancy can actually \"fix\" hydro From everything I have read up on it, you should be fine to have children. No more likely to have complications than someone without hydrocephalus and/or a shunt. Thank you for asking this. I am not planning on getting pregnant anytime soon but it is a concern. There is not a whole lot of info out there. Congratulations!! Please let us know what your neurosurgeon advises. :) Have you gone to the hydrocephalus association website? ( There is some information on pregnancy and there is also a peer mentoring program where you can connect someone with hydro has had a successful pregnancy. When I was trying to get pregnant a few years ago my surgeon gave me the go ahead, but I have a programmable. Will do :) Nahhh that is incorrect I did think as much. I have a shunt like yours and had to have a C-Section.  They considered me high risk due to the shunt.  Any questions, please let me know!  My son was born 17 years ago so things might be different now. Thank you for this update!!!", "I have a VP shunt. Anyone ever experience discomfort in there stomach where tubing is?  Yes. I would get pain in my side where it is when I ran. Ok. Also, these past two days I have had symptoms of Nausea, upset stomach/ diarrhea (gross tmi sorry) and overall just flu feeling. Then the stomach tubing discomfort came a long. I was just hoping that my symptoms were not correlated with my shunt and maybe I just have a stomach bug. If that is the case, I wonder why my shunt tubing is sore.  Sometimes you just get sore, I think. But I would still talk to your neurosurgeon or neologist if things get worse or do not get better. I hurt after it calcified and I fell and the shunt snapped in about 3 different places in my neck. They took it out in November. I sometime get diaphragm irritation due to the tubing. Involves a very painful stitch in my stomach and side. It often radiates up my back and into my shoulder as well. Usually caused by being too cold or being exposed to a fan. It takes all day to shake and is literally some of the worst pain I have ever been in in my life.  My office is freezing so that is a good point. I suppose I will just keep an eye on it. Thanks! Good luck to you, I do not wish that pain on my worst enemy.  If you have a fever, that is a sign of infection which is bad. You might be getting symptoms of a migraine though. When I first got my shunt installed, I had horrible nausea from migraines but I did not know it was from the migraine, because I never had experienced a migraine prior to the shunt.\n\nDefinitely watch out for fevers and go to the hospital right away if you get one. If you are light sensitive, invest in a good pair of cocoones (eyewear brand). If you feel a sharp pain where the tube is in your head, that is apparently a tension headache. It is normal. Yes, I can feel the tension when I get these when I feel the back of my neck. It is always on the side with my shunt. Very weird. Much discomfort in my chest where the tube crosses the collar bone and below. Does not help when 4 and 2 year olds like to apply pressure at just the right point. Last shunt went in in 1990. Not even sure if I still need one. Late to the party, yeah definitely occasionally get pain. Nothing intense, but yeah for sure.  I do. Allot of times my scar hurts or the tubbing in my neck. Right now the while thing is messed up and I am very sick ", "Season headaches What are your worst seasons for pressure headaches? Rainy seasons are the worst for me, which i imagine is the case for most of us. I usually have bad days when the weather changes rapidly in the same day though, whether it is from hot to cold or cold to hot.  I think most of the Plains states are the same with that. A lot of the time when we change seasons or a couple days before a storm hits is what gets me. Mom of a kid with hydrocephalus here - What do your headaches feel like?  As far as I can tell, it is from the season change. It feels like a small aching but it usually goes away after a few days of a weather change. I have had this condition since birth, I just wondered If anyone else finds relief with anything except ice or heat. My headache has pretty much gone away. Yay for weather changes. Anytime a storm is brewing, I am usually aware about a day before hand. Thanks for sharing. (Father of a baby with a shunt and hydrocephalus.)  I have NPH Hydrocephalus.  Experiencing a headache cycle for the last 8 days.  I think it may be due to the nor\u2019easter we had last week.  Have not had pain and vertigo like this in 8 months.   The only way to resolve it is bed rest, hydration, maxalt and no electronics.", "Noise-Cancelling Headphones Hello Hydro Homies,\n\nJust wondering if anyone has a recommendation for good noise cancelling headphones? I have a programmable shunt and I did not know if there are magnets in them that might reset it. I am not entirely sure, but several years ago I tried VR and it messed me up pretty badly.\n\nThanks! I use the Apple AirPods Pro which offer noise cancellation. I have been pretty satisfied with them and like that they go in ear and I have not had any problems I use Sony noise-cancelling headphones as I have pretty horrendous migraines and am extremely sensitive to sound (associated with the trauma of having ya skull drilled into- fun stuff). Never had any issues with them, sound quality is amazing and they they feel so light and cushiony on your head too!", "Those of you who have had a shunt replaced due to headaches (overtraining) and had improvement, what kind of symptoms were you having?  Headache that developed when I was upright but subsided somewhat when lying down.  New plumbing installed and I was good to go. Was it every day?  Any other neurological or visual symptoms?  Thanks for the reply. It got a little worse every day until the surgery. Both times this has happened to me I have had mild to extreme headaches in upright positions. After laying down, the pain subsides after anything from 5 minutes to several hours. \n\nBoth times I have had to have shunt revisions, with either new valves and leads the first time, to a complete replacement the second time. Second time did not help me much, so I then had an ETV 2 months ago. On the mend now,  but not 100% still. Thanks for the feedback. Hope you find some relief! Overdrainge is a common issue. It can happen at any team really, but it usually happens when you are upright. It needs to be resolved before your vents become slit and noncompliant. I have been in to see my surgeon and I think a valve replacement is in my near future.  It will be my first but I am not really worried about it.  Made it 8 years on the first! I had 2 shunts put in when I was a baby and only had to have a revision (replacement) when I was 32. I was told by my neurosurgeon that he knows of patients who are 50+ and have not had any issues. So you might not even have to get a second revision after that for a very long time. Wow! How were your headaches growing up? I sure hope not!  Thanks for the info. I cannot remember vividly since I was a baby basically and now I am 35. But the little I can remember that were not too bad. I considered myself lucky because they said I would more than likely need a revision at 16 but did not need to since it was working fine. Usually the headaches I got where because I was sleeping in an unelevated position. And that is only because I moved alot while i was sleeping. Hopefully this helps put your mind at ease a bit more.", "What is your biggest fear as a shuntee?  Honestly, reading through posts on this sub I am realizing I have pretty mild case of hydrocephalus.  I cannot say I am scared of anything.  I serve a God who comforts me in the occasional pain before a revision and who I can go to be with if this condition does end up killing me. We are all in it together. That is the other comforting thing, at least for me. Before I found the sub, I knew of one other friend of mine who has it Getting a staphylococcus infection in the spinal fluid again. Those six months stunk.  Having the Hydrocephalus come back &amp; it being caught too late like it was the first time.  Some days especially with the cold weather it can be tough\n Most definitely. It gets incredibly painful due to the headaches, do you get shunt pain in the abdominal area? As I have found that  ice cold, or very cold water makes the pain go away rather quickly. \n\nOne other thing, i have read in a few posts that some people experience immaturity, as they are of an older age, but feel far younger, i myself experience that. However as soon as the fluid is drained i feel like my actual age. \n\nI was just wondering if you or anyone else in this forum experiences the same issues? Be it cognitive fogginess or an inability to recall information?  Not generally unless im having a malfunction,  I dont have things that make things in my day more difficult  Oh that is great news. I hope that they find an actual cure for this condition. ", "Am I the only one? I only used to experience the daily headaches, after my revision in 2000/2001. I was 10 or 11. Now as an adult, it feels like my symptoms or side effects have become worse. I experience things like confusion and forgetfulness very often.\n\nHas anyone else noticed their symptoms getting worse as time goes by? Yes! I feel the same way sometimes! Which symptoms of yours have gotten worse, if I may ask? Sometimes i will stare out into space. \nI will day dream. \nI will have lots of confusion. \nI have Nystagmus and it gets worse when headaches arise. \nHeadaches are always a pain. \nIf you are symptoms are getting worse and worse day by day i would definitely see your doctor. Could be sign of malfunction. \n\nAs a child, i do not remember much of my symptoms- i just had two revisions this month and i am more aware of my symptoms and how i can react to them. Always get to know your symptoms. My first revision my legs went completely numb and I was in malfunction and had a shunt infection- so now if my legs ever go numb again, i know to probably see my doctor immediately. See, I never knew this about the legs going numb as a symptom for a malfunction.  I  always read about your typical headache, nausea, not being to keep awake etc. So thank you so much for this. I learned something I had to google Nystagmus lol. But after reading what symptoms it consists of, I can say I relate.\n\nI currently do not have a neuro that I am seeing, so I need to urgently find one and have a proper evaluation with him/her and see if it is not a malfunction (hopefully not).\n\nHoping you recover(ed) well from the revisions. I read \u201cshunts can have crazy symptoms\u201d and went \ud83d\ude2c But thank you so so much! I will def message you I know. It is scary. Super scary and weird. \nSome patients will have the typical, textbook symptoms. And then other patients will have crazy off the wall symptoms. I am on of those patients. My eyes go crazy, my legs and arms go numb, etc. \nyes please message :) It is also not always the same symptoms. That is what is hard. My legs have only gone numb once with a malfunction. Symptoms differ from time to time that is why hydrocephalus is so annoying at times haha Lmao so this printout I got of the \u201cregular\u201d malfunction symptoms could turn out to be useless \u270d\ud83c\udffd Got it \ud83d\ude02 Please do not let that scare you! \nAlways always look for the regular symptoms too!!!!

Some patients could have the basic throwing up, sleeping a lot, headaches, etc. and some patients could have weird symptoms along with the regular symptoms. \nPlease do not push small symptoms aside!!! I will remember that and be alert to what my body\u2019s trying to tell me. I have a couple of more questions, but I want to message you about them tomorrow morning Of course!!! I am an open book and would love to chat about it!", "Headaches and food Anyone else experience that the usual hydrocephalus headache is eased in a way by things you eat during a headache. This question comes up because I just ate chocolate and my headache just eased.", "VP Shunt and covid vaccine Hi everyone! Just after some advice and experiences before I speak to my doctor really. \n\nI am 26, live in Australia and looking at which vaccine would be best for me. I developed hydrocephalus a couple hours after I was born, had my shunt put in and have had relatively smooth ride since. I had the tubing replaced (broken) when I was 11, had a quick check up when I was about 22 and everything is fine. In fact my neurosurgeon assumes I do not even use it anymore.\n\nMy question is, has anyone had any particular side effects or anything with any of the vaccines? Where I am in Australia, the only vaccine readily available is AstraZeneca and I am concerned about my shunt with the possibility of blood clots. Just after any experiences that anyone else may have had! Thank you :) I am in the US, so we do not have the AZ vaccine. I have a VP shunt and I am 31 and have had it since approximately 6 months old with a half-dozen revisions. \n\nI did not have any hydrocephalus-related side effects with either Moderna vaccine dose I received. I had the oft-reported immune reaction to both doses of a sore arm, fatigue, and slight fevers. You might double check with your neuro if you are still in touch with them just to double-check, but I have not seen news of any approved vaccines having hydrocephalus as a contraindication.\n\nI hope you are able to get it soon without issue! :) 37, 2 Pfeizer shots, absolutely no side effects. Do it! I had Astra and have a VP shunt. The first dose was horrid, I had quite a serious reaction but I am also on birth control and am at risk to clots so I suspect this is why (rather than linked to shunt). Second dose I got Pfizer and other than a sore arm for a couple days, I was fine. It is better to have it than to be unprotected :) 27 here, 2x pfizer - first dose  high temperature body aches for around 2 days, second dose i had what i think was called brain fog for 3 days just couldnt put my thoughts together although doubt its anything to do with hydro as my healthy mom had same symptoms 36, male, VA shunt, Moderna, no side effects. 47, M, VA shunt. I have been fully vaccinated (Pfizer) since April with no hydrocephalus issues. After the second injection, I felt horrible the next day, but other than that, nada. 24m, 2x Pfizer. No major side effects other than feeling tired and having a sore arm for a day How did you react to Astra ? I got Astra too and had a reaction that I did not see in any of the expected symptoms list . I am also in Australia and had Pfizer. I have stents instead of a VP shunt now and have pretty bad migraines at the moment. I had a 17 day headache/migraine after the first shot. Second shot is Sunday so I am prepared with triptans, we will see what happens haha. I have confirmed cerebral clots so I was ruled out from AZ. \n\nDo look into the plan for your area before going ahead with anything as the time between vaccines for AZ is much longer than Pfizer (3 months vs 3 weeks). So if you start AZ and 4 weeks later they release Pfizer to your age group, you would still be able to get fully vaccinated with Pfizer quicker than with AZ. I was basically bed bound for a few days. Severe migraines/vomiting/fever/chills/fainting/aches/shivering/diarrhoea/rashes/hives etc etc honestly the list goes on\u2026 I was in a real bad state. Took me around a week to fully recover and I slept for around 16 hours a day. Pfizer dose 2 was fine, just had a sore arm I think it is important to remember that the systems affected by Hydrocephalus are not the same as the one that run your immune system. You will be fine\n\nAlso I am 26 and fully vaccinated with moderna 28, Pfizer, no side effects with first but felt flue like tired and achey after second bit only got 2 days I had only the minor typical side effects to Moderna. I was more afraid of neurological side effects of COVID. Got my first jab of Pfizer yesterday! Arms a little sore but that is it :)", "Should I be this normal...? I was diagnosed with hydrocephalus not long after birth and had 4 related surgeries before I was 7. I am declaired healthy since I was 10. Apparently there are extremely rare cases when the issue resolves itself and a shunt is no longer needed for life. I still have the equipments in my body though even though I no longer need them. \n\n\nI still have health anxiety due to being ill as a child and when I read up on hydrocephalus the studies mention that if it is caught early and shunt revisions are done well then the children can have \"close to\" normal socialization and cognitive abilities. some of these studies were written by the neurosugions who treated my during infancy. \n\nI am a really high functioning adult now. I did almost on top of my class in university. I speak 3 languages. I should be doing well right? I have my struggles, but I am doing generally well I think. Nobody would guess that I had hydrocephalus which should mean that I am not cognitively impaired, right? I think I am as close to normal as I can be. but when I read studies that say I can only be \"close to\" normal, I get really anxious. My normal is not everyone elses? I am not smart? I am not actually capable?\n\nI have this recurring strong fear that I am actually mentally disabled due to hydrocephalus even though I know I am not. My childhood neuropsychologist said so. But then I read the studies that say I should not be able to do this well in life and I feel awful. I am only close to normal... and I am not sure what does that mean. \n\nI feel like an impostor because of hydrocephalus. Is there anybody else that feels like this? Wow this is me to a T. I was diagnosed at birth (1995), and had 4 revisions between 95 and 99. I have been fine ever since. I get occasional migraines and I have vision loss in one eye, but I graduated near the top of my class EARLY with a bachelor\u2019s in biochemistry, graduated with a 4.0 for my first master\u2019s, and I am now in the process of completing my second. I have a full time job and a part time job, I drive, I am married, I have a beautiful 2 year old son and now I am pregnant with a baby girl. I played sports my entire childhood and no one would ever know I had hydrocephalus unless I tell them. I am not just \u201cclose to\u201d living a normal life, I am absolutely thriving and I am not afraid to be proud of that. I do not know if my shunt is still medically necessary and I still have the equipment.  I know I am lucky but I am trying to take advantage of it as best I can. Thank you for sharing!! My daughter (3yo) has hydrocephalus and your story is inspiring!! This might be easier said than done but I would recommend taking it one day at a time and not over thinking it. I am 30 years old now and I had somewhere between 100 and 150 shunt revisions between when I was diagnosed at 1 and when I switched to stents at 28. I went through school with no extra provisions, other than some extensions when I was not at school, I did an undergrad in physics and chemistry, first class honours in chemistry, my PhD in chemistry and have just finished my first post doc in chemistry and started another job in a physics department. I have a spouse and we own our home and another house to care for family. I am physically mostly fine, a little bit of blindness at the bottom of my vision but it just means I cannot see my feet if I look straight ahead so I have to look down a bit when I run. I compete in triathlons and play a few team sports.\n\nIf you find yourself really dwelling on this issue of \"should I be able to do this?\" Then I would suggest maybe getting some therapy to deal with this because it is not going to help you. Just take each day as it comes and try your best in what you want to do with your life. Did you have any complications with your pregnancy? I have always wondered if my VP shunt could cause issue as the belly expands.  \n\n\nAlso, I am very happy to hear you are doing so well! And using your circumstances as motivation to do well. Hydrocephalus effects the system that protects, nourishes and removes waste of the central nervous system. There are many ways that system can back up, which is why there are multiple types and a large variety of symptoms that people with hydrocephalus experience. Thanks to modern medicine it is looked for an caught in infants and treated quickly. The prognosis for patients with hydrocephalus is really good. I do not know what studies you are reading, but I would suggest you stop. Research is not really made for that and it is not a very reliable way to diagnose yourself. It can be great for justifying your opinions. You sound like you have had good and timely treatment. Be happy. I was monitored super closely because of my shunt but did not have complications related to it. I was induced early for high blood pressure and hemorrhaged after my son was born but neither one of those things were related to hydrocephalus. Thank you so much for your reply! You really should not be thinking about yourself the way you are. I have learned a long time ago that everyone is \u201cnormal\u201d is different. That goes for people who have defects and people who do not. As another of those rare cases who is not shunt dependent, I can relate to this story. I was in high school before they realized I did, in fact, have some definite, problematic cognitive issues. Have had plenty of experiences on both sides of the coin, i.e., I have won academic awards and yet my story of the attempts to get through college would make your head spin.\n\nI am one who tends to research the literature deeply; although there are many things that are painfully familiar, there are definitely some descriptions that do not fit at all. I have often said I am on \"both sides of the fence\" because although I have some unusual learning disabilities, I was bright enough to get three college degrees with a 3.7 GPA. I have definitely had moments of  \"is this really possible?\"; \"Am I really this functional?\"...since I did manage, after years of bust my butt work and much accommodation, to find a niche in the world of work and a decent career. So you are not the only one who feels that way. Many of the studies I found in the literature were either really outdated, done on people who had extreme degrees of problems owing to hydrocephalus, or both. The high functioning ones like us tend to, as one special ed teacher I came to know as an adult put it, \"fall through the cracks in the system\". We are not fake, the system just does not know what to do with us when we do not fit into their neat little boxes... Thanks for sharing, I am glad to be not the only one! Also congrats on every success! That is a really lot of revisions, sounds rough! I cannot even imagine having that many!\n\nThanks for the kind reassurances! You are right, I do tend to overthink it, although not as much as I used to, but I still tend to. I am in therapy (not exactly for this), but I feel kind of stupid for bringing this fear of mine up often, (I know it is irrational most of the time) I just mentioned it once or twice, passingly. I will have to try to be more open about it! They are old studies, written by my neurosurgeion, who operated on me during the 90s. There is not really much in my native tongue, so I have read some stuff in english, but these ones from my doctor have me worried to most. But you are right that the study is already 2 decades old, and medicine improved a lot even since then.\n\nI also think that reading up on this stuff will not make a different in my brain or how do I function, and at this point maybe does more harm then good, making me more worried. I do have to stop. It is funny, but when I think about other people I rarely think of them as normal or not normal, it is only when it comes to myself. You are right, that it is very normative, and not helpful, I will try to improve my thinking, thanks! Thanks for sharing, it is really cool to know I am not the only one, I never spoke to people who had similar cases. Our story does seem really similar, like in many of the points you wrote!\n\nIf it is not a problem, can I PM you? I just have a few questions, if you are up to it. Not a problem. feel free to ask any questions the reply might have inspired. I am shunt dependent, and was unlucky enough to have other issues the correlated with hydrocephalus. Do not use functioning labels, it is dismissive and rude.\n\nBeing disabled because you have hydrocephalus would not necessarily be a bad thing. I have been doing it since birth. No it should not the surgeon should put enough tubing in for growth etc. How would you switch from a shunt to a stent when a stent does a different thing.\n\nDo you have a VA or IHP? I had VP shunts. My stents are placed in narrow areas of my cerebral sinuses. By expanding these areas the pressure goes down in the vein and the CSF is then able to diffuse into the vein with normal fluid dynamics and is reabsorbed in the vascular system.", "Well then... I had a headache that was bad enough to seek medical attention yesterday afternoon and got home mid morning today.  Reading over the reports, a CT that was done of my neck shows that there is a buildup of fluid in the tubing as it passes my throat on the way from behind the right ear down across my ribcage.\n\nApparently this had also appeared in CT's from a few years ago, but it was never mentioned to me by docs to the best of my recollection. However, I had noticed a small bump in the area a few months ago but thought nothing of it at the time - I thought it was just a sore muscle that was close to the tubing and continued on dealing with all of my other problems.  I ran my fingers over it today and felt how large the buildup is... yup, scary as fuck now.\n\nAnother kicker: the neurosurgeon who was last overseeing my care passed away sometime last year, whereas I had not seen him in probably three years as his instructions were along the lines of 'Your condition appears to be under control at this time and yearly follow ups are unnecessary. Get in touch if anything drastic occurs.'\n\nI found out about his passing not from his office, but from a receptionist at a new chronic pain specialist I was visiting last month while they were asking questions about my history of care...I have not been able to see a new neurosurgeon as of yet thanks to Covid.", "Has anyone else been given Acetazolamide for elevated intracranial pressure? Is it normal for the side effects to SUCK in the beginning ? If so, how long do they typically last before your body gets used to it?  I use to take it and the side effect that really bothered me was tingling in my feet. The tingling lasted until I came off of the medicine when I had my VP shunt installed. Ugh! For me it is tingling in my hands, legs, lips &amp; feet. \n\nThey replaced my second shunt with with ETV just over a year ago, but my Neuro recently found that my ICP is STILL high, thus the meds. \ud83d\ude22 Ugh. I hated this. First off it was like $700 a bottle and the side effects sucked. I felt worse on it than not :( My insurance is covering it completely, so I guess I got lucky.\n\nBut I thought the headaches I was getting before I started it SUCKED! Everything im dealing with ON IT might suck MORE.\n\nWhat side effects did you deal with? Tingling, vision issues, and the worst was that I would basically throw up after every pill. I felt like I had to plan out when I would take it so I could work in time to vomit after I have not taken it since I got my shunt in Aug 2017. My issue for the past year has been low pressure headaches even though my ICP is \u201cnormal\u201d. I go back to JHU in Baltimore tomorrow to have my shunt or anti-siphon device adjusted. Sorry you are still having issues. Did you have to taper it? My Neuro has me doing 1 a day for 5 days, 2 a day for 5 days, then upping to 3 a day. Good luck tomorrow, and thanks for the well wishes Yes and then had to taper back down when I asked to be off of it Would not this medication just be temporary? That is the thing.\n\nI read that it is intended only for short term use.\n\nNaturally I was a bit confused/concerned when my Neuro said I am likely to be on it for the rest of my life. Here is what WebMD has to say about the side affects :\n\n(\n\nOf course, with any medication you have to give it awhile to see how it is going to affect you. \n\nDo you also have issues with snoring too? I would ask for a referral to the Sleep Disorders Clinic as well. Yeah.\n\nNeuro already wrote me a referral, but the place she referred me has been jerking me around &amp; unfortunately I am kind of at their mercy since there are not a lot of people who do sleep studies here. I am sorry to hear that. I would get a 2nd opinion Just did! And? I am being kept off any meds for the time being and am being sent for more tests. Thanks.\n\nEhh, American healthcare at its finest, lol. You are right....I would explain what the good Ole' American Healthcare system has done to me, but I do not think you would want to read the book I would have to write. LOL!\n\nIt is disgusting that those of us who have Hydrocephalus have to go through at times. I sometimes do not understand WHY these doctors go into neurosurgery if they do not want to help those of us who have been diagnosed with Hydro.\n\nI hate to see anyone dx'ed with Hydrocephalus to go through even HALF of the B.S. I have. (went through). Love, strength &amp; solidarity to you.\n\nIf we do not stick together, it feels like no one has our backs.", "Head tilt headaches? Hey all\nDo you guys get sudden strong headaches from just the movement of your head?\nI am trying to see if this could be hydro related or just Migraine fun. I do, I am not sure if it is related to hydro or not though. I have only had a shunt for about 6 months and still have trouble knowing what pains are attributed to it or something else. Sorry I could not be of much help!", "Worries about school My son is 3 and we are going to be starting with the school program this year. With him having a very low immune system and other medical complications. I am wondering if I should even send him to school. Looking for other parents opinions about schooling or homeschooling for special needs kids. I worry about hydrocephalus in general, but I am not really concerned about it with respect to my 4 year old going to pre-k. The worst case scenario is she has a shunt failure, but the time frame for which that manifests is much longer than a school day. Essentially a shunt failure does not sneak up on you. Definitely understand if it was him just having a shunt my mind would be set on sending him to school. He also has a feeding tube, cannot sit up or support his own weight, low immune system, scaring in his eyes which causes lack of vision, and seizures. So with everything my mind is just worried. How severe is his case. Im 20 and have had multiple surgeries throughout my life, but never had much problem with school. My worst has been when i had symptoms since the day before but thought it was just something mild until mid day when my headache got bad and while walking to the nurse office i passed out. Dont worry much, ik from what i just said it might sound scary but it was a one time and my body was already hinting since a day before, also every single other time if i just feel bad i wont go to school that day, just in case. So in short, out of 17 years of school now only once has it caused a problem and it was totally preventable.\n\nHope this helps. He was born with hydrocephalus so his head is quite bigger than other kids. He is 3 now but cannot support hisself to sit up he holds his head if his chest is supported though. We have been through 3 shunt revisions so that is not new to us. But with him also being on a feeding tube, has seizures, and little to no vision, and non verbal. School just worries me. Mhmm honestly that is more severe than me, my only suggestion here is assessment with a neurosurgeon.", "What should I buy food-wise? Hey everyone! I am finally in the process of being able to get my VP shunt surgery. What would be some easy foods I can buy to make recovery a bit easier. I know that for most people recovery is quick. However, I am a bit concerned that because my last surgery recovery took almost a month and I almost passed away. I am worried that recovery will be longer than usual. Anyway, I am rambling lol \n\nThank you for any help. I bought a big box of madras lentils from Costco that you just stick in the microwave. It was pretty low maintenance and comforting Oh yeah, the lentils are great. I also recommend the Shoyu Ramen bowls! I love Mac and Cheese... To be honest, I would just get your favorite foods no matter what they are. The worst is to have to do/eat something that you do not like while recovering.", "Pain relief? Has anybody found any pain meds or other forms of relief for these horrible headaches? Ice packs? Other things? (Also, do you currently have a shunt/no?) \n\nI am just currently in so much pain- feels like a tea kettle trying to explode out my head. I am trying encasing my head in ice and I took a Percocet, which I think is taking the edge off, but thought I would see what works for you all. \n\n\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 Tie some fabric around your head.. not too tight, but just snug enough to put steady pressure on your scalp...it is like a head massage, except it is all around your head. \n\nSorry you are in pain, what is your diagnosis? Stretching and massaging helps relive the pain a bit for me. Kind of a long storry, but: \n\n\nSo the doctors appointment was because I have been having basically constant horrible headaches that I am 97% sure are high CSF pressure headaches. I used to have really high CSF pressure and produce too much. When I had my Chiari decompression surgery, they also put in a shunt for the CSF issues. Was all wonderful and no problems. Then when I went septic with the UC botched surgery in 2016, they removed the shunt so the sepsis would not mainline to the brain and kill me. They did not put it back in right away because my body had been through so much trauma, and then I was doing fine without it, and I really did not want more surgery,so I never had it put back in. But now I am having those headaches again. Not only have they been really painful (and you know they have got to be bad if they are even showing up on my radar), I am realizing while I went through treatment for the ptsd from the UC, we never dealt with the Chiari related ptsd. Which made sense, because at the time of therapy I had not had any Chiari/headache symptoms or any triggers for that since 2010. This August will be a decade since my decompression. 10 years since I have had to even think about any of this stuff. But these headaches have brought all of it slamming back. So not only have I been in pain physically, I have been falling apart emotionally. Reliving the fear of seeing doctors and getting potentially ignored or downplayed, probably having to have more lumbar punctured and scans and maybe surgery, alll the feelings of having to involve Matt in medical stuff that he did not sign on for, having to deal with medical shit i was so sure I would never have to deal with again, all of it. It is. So. Much. \n\nAnd then I have not been sleeping well because of the ptsd and the pain, and I have not been completely forthcoming with Matt about how badly this is affecting me because I do not want to make him worry even more than he already is, esp since he is dealing with some work stuff that is stressing him out and making his anxiety bad, and so I did not ask him to take me to the doctor this morning. Also bc I thought I would be okay. But I did not sleep much last night because part of me is even more afraid of what happens if it turns out that this *is not* csf related (bc if it is, like my logical brain thinks it must be, it is honestly an easy fix), because then idk what it is and that brings up other ptsd shit or not knowing what is wrong with me and all that Jazz. \n\nThen last night when I was preparing for the appointment by making my timeline and making notes and stuff and printing off the surgical reports for the doctor that my mom had sent me, I read them, and that really did not fucking help my anxiety. and whenever my ptsd and anxiety get bad, it raises my BP which spikes my ICP, which makes my pain worse, and that turns into a vicious cycle. \n\nTLDR; Chiari malformation, Syrinx, depcompression, hydrocephalus. Decompressed 2010. Shunt removed 2016. Moved to Denver from Houston in 2018. Bad pressure headaches off and on sense, getting worse. What kind of stretches and massages? Thanks for the detailed reply.\n\nI also have anxiety, apparently living with a brain abnormality can cause a bit of mental stress...I rate in the 95th percentile for anxiety I  my class/age/sex. \n\nBreathing and yoga have helped.  You have to take control of your mind, read The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.  He is not a religious preacher, just spiritual thinker who has figured things out..Oprah talks about him often. \n\nLet me know if this helps. I start with my neck then move to my temples. Literally just pressing against my head relieved pain, although temporary. Also a hot rag rinsed off and applying that can help too! I have found fioricet helps with my headaches 9/10 over opioids. \n\nI typically due the ice pack thing if it is a really bad headache and take half a Percocet. Hm, I do not think I have ever tried fioricet. I will ask my doctor about it, though! I saw when looking it up on google that there is fioricet and also fioricet with codeine...which do you use? I am allergic to codeine so definitely the one without it \ud83d\ude02 \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 plz no codeine for you With codeine.  I just took it.

Hello Everyone,\n\nI may have brought this up before, but I just get embarrassed and feel alone on some days.\n\nI am 28 and still wet the bed at night and have problems with my brain getting the signal to go to the bathroom during the day. I often do not know until it is too late and have bladder and bowel accidents. Even though setting an alarm helps, I still have to wear GoodNites (pull ups) during busy days or NorthShore Supreme medical diapers at night.\n\nI know it is not my fault since I have a lot of medical conditions that affected my development. (Hydrocephalus, brain bleed from being born premature, spine/nerve issues) I also have Autism and Tourette's Syndrome, but I just feel like I am the only one.\n\nIs there anyone else with similar experiences or conditions?\n\nI appreciate everyone sharing their experiences and helping me feel less alone in dealing with my medical conditions. I am sorry you are dealing with these symptoms! It must be hard.\n\nMy son has hydrocephalus but has never had this type of issue. I think it would have more to do with you spine/nerve issues. I am not a doctor or anything, but I suggest you talk to a neurologist about the problem. I struggled with incontinence for many years (well into my teens) and one thing I would recommend that helped me for a while is an alarm you hook to the crotch of your underwear and it goes off when it detects urine. It is not a guarantee fix but it might work for you. If you want to try it, I think they have them on Amazon This can be difficult when diagnosed with Hydrocephalus. ( I was dx'ed later in life at 30 yrs old) I am now retired)  I would (if I were you) start trying to limit the liquid you dink 3 hours prior to bed-time. If you are thirsty, eat 5-10 seedless grapes. This will quench your thirst and stop the need (pretty much) to drink fluids to see if this helps. OF course if it does not (and you have given it a good amount of time to make sure if it helps or not)\n\nRight now I am going through issues like this with urine incontinence. I have an appointment with my PCP at the end of the month to rule out that they Hydro is not the issue (and I do not think it is. Then too, I am not one that focuses a lot on the medical issues I have. (and I have other medical issues as well)  (*and plz note that I am not saying you are over-focused here at all.)* \n\n*I am the champ at not focusing on my medical issues*. I want nothing more than to try to live a full life without someone constantly reminding me about my XYZ medical issues LOL! \n\nGood luck! Younger than you but my son who is nine has urgency with urine so likely an overactive bladder. He is wet at night and it can overfill the pull ups. I have always thought the hydrocephalus was to blame. Chatted to a friend whose child is a year older with hydrocephalus and he has no problems. I wore one of those things with a sensor that I put into my pull up when I was growing up and it did not help. I tried again a few years ago as an adult with one I put inside my nighttime diaper, but it did not train my brain after a few months it just made me tired. It helps to know Im not alone. I was a preemie so I am smaller and still have to use GoodNites pull ups as Depends are too big. But Im embarrassed to admit in high school for my bedwetting I had to switch to heavier medical diapers at night due to leaks. It helps knowing Im not alone. He was born at 33 weeks. He is been referred for ADHD but that takes years here to get a diagnosis. You are definitely not alone, I have even chatted to friends at work and heard of a couple of children with no neurological problems that have been wet as a teenager. All the best to you. I have had bladder problems since I was a baby \nAnd since diagnosis at 40 I hardly have trouble.\nIf my pressure plays up I seem to have less warning that I need to go and have to make a quick dash Hi there. My mom is 55 and was just diagnosed with hydrocephalus caused by a brain tumor. She started exhibiting the first warning signs (that we noticed) a few months ago, and among the strange behavior was several instances of bowel incontinence. Now, interestingly enough, though she has progressed rapidly, this has not happened again in a couple months or so. But this was never an issue she had before... we assume that correlation = causation in this instance Cause for this might be a neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  \nA spastic neurogenic bladder ca be casued by HC.\n\nI would propose to contact an urologist and have a urodynamic testing. \n\nThere exists medical treatment for such cases.", "Shunts AND a CI? Does anybody here have both shunts and cochlear implants?", "Connections I know that there are quite a few things that can come with having hydrocephalus depending on the type and how procedures go. I was just wondering if depression was a connected symptom . I know I have heard it before and as I have grown older the past year or so I have felt it come in waves. \n\nHas anyone else come across this, or is this something entirely separate I should be looking into ? In my experience, especially after a procedure you can experience chemical imbalances that can definitely cause anxiety and depression and the like. If they are continued problems for you, I would suggest having it checked out as in can be totally unrelated. Yes, I have had all of the above.  Stay close to your doctor and inform him/ her of any symptoms.  I often used to feel overwhelmed and anxious. \n\nIt is the brain, anytime there is work done in your head you can have side effects.  I for one am very sensitive to meds, take very small doses compared to others.  Effexor is an amazing drug I used for a year or so to calm my mind. Depression is definitely if not a symptom, a result of having Hydrocephalus. I have have communicating Hydrocephalus for 17 years (IVH at birth) and I have always been depressed. I was diagnosed in sixth grade. It just comes with the territory of chronic pain, and that goes for any chronic pain disorder. It messes with you and how you see things. It is hard to be excited to wake up the next morning when you know it will hurt. It is hard to get out of bed when that motion makes you feel dizzy and like you are going to puke your brains out. It is hard to be excited about life when you constantly have to plan around having brain surgery (50 and counting for me). It sucks and I am sorry you are going through it. But there is a new reflow device out that could possibly save you from another surgery, I just got it and it is helped me to not be as anxious about surgery. (Just look up Joseph Madsen ReFlow shunt Device.) best of luck to you. I had my last revision 12 years ago and I have not had any trouble since . Well maybe a few headaches here and there but that is mainly with allergies :). \n\nWhen it comes to the depression it just feels like I am being resin on in my head or I am under water. I have been in meds before (vivance ) but felt it messed to much with my emotions . I am an actor and I cannot be all up beat in a sad scene lol .   \n\nMaybe I just need some motivation and I need to find my passion again.  It is been a while since I have made anything really worth while and when I do, I feel on top of the world. Hell even finding this group make it all better . I cannot say I have found anyone where I live who I can relate to hahaha . Yeah, I mean Hydrocephalus is different for everyone. For me everything hurts and I have a headache 24/7, and two shunt surgeries a year at this rate. And just as that is different so is depression, it can be triggered by things and then dial down when something nice happens. Motivation is hard, and it is even harder getting the motivation TO GET motivated. I have issues with that. I just make myself do it even if I do not want to. Even if I am scared it will make my headache worse or I am tired, just little things at a time. Like talking to a friend. Or reading a book. Or cleaning something. Small victories will turn into big ones, not right away, but slowly. I am just now learning how different is is for everyone . I see a lot of posts of people dealing with pain and I count my blessing that I am not experiencing those symptoms . I do have headaches here and there but I have notice it is more of the depression and sadness that I am dealing with.  It is nice to k ow there is a community to reach out to . My mother is the one in my family with hydrocephalus, she deals with depression and has been on some sort of antidepressant for the past 20 something years. My sister and I (her only two children) dont have hydrocephalus but we both deal with depression. I would say just let your doctor know and be open about it. Medication, situations, and natural imbalances can all affect your mental health. I was born with hydrocephalus and had quite a few surgeries to correct it. By the time I was 9 I was medically cleared and my shunt was non-functioning and deemed no longer needed.\n\nCorrelation does not always equal causation, but I have minor depression and severe anxiety.

Occasionally I will have severe pain related to my shunt that puts me out of commission for several hours to a day or so and I never know how to address it with work. Today I was at work and had to leave early because the pain was really bad and I threw up. I feel guilty for leaving early and was lucky I even had coverage so I could. Currently I am in bed trying to wait it out. \nAnyway. I did not explain to my boss why I needed to leave other than that I felt sick. I know I am probably not obligated to, but it is tricky since this both relatively rare (so people do not often know about it) and something that can come on suddenly for me. \nHow do you guys approach it? Edit: a word Legally I do not believe you have to divulge anything about your health to your employer. If you really like your place of work I would consider telling someone. Lots of people have conditions and many of them can be quite embarrassing. As a hydrocephalus parent I have had my perspective changed about a lot of things due to my experiences. It is made me a more compassionate, understanding and patient person. Sharing life experiences can better people around you. That is just my personality though. I am sure there are people on this small sub that are really guarded too and there is nothing wrong with going about your work career keeping it all to yourself.  Most people I work with do not know I have hydrocephalus.  I told a few coworkers and that is it.  My boss does not know.  I get severe headaches from time to time and sometimes just go home early and no one questions it.  My biggest fear is that if my boss or HR found out they would simply fire me.  They like to say we have insurance for health matters but if things are bad enough the coverage some people get is being \"let go\" Most people at my job do not know about my Hydro., but I did let my supervisor know before I was hired about it if I did end up needing surgery for it while I worked there. I let them know that I have not had a problem in years, but if I ever did, this is why. Generally I know by now how long I will be out, my recovery time and everything else and so I will do my best to keep them updated if surgery does need to happen. I felt better about being upfront about everything so they would know, just in case. ", "Trying to Help my Husband- Advice Needed My husband was born with hydrocephalus and has had many revisions over the last 36 years. His most recent revision was in 2015, and beginning shortly after he began to experience headaches, nausea and vomiting, dizzy and fainting spells, memory loss, imbalance, and heaviness in his head. These symptoms have progressively gotten worse and in the last 3 months, we have been in the emergency room at least 10 times with episodes of him passing out or having these symptoms for days on end with no relief from prescribed medications.\n\nHis mother and I firmly believe that the shunt is partially malfunctioning- whether that means that he needs a new valve or a new pressure setting or something. The valve in his shunt has never been replaced and is not adjustable, therefore it has been set at the same pressure for 36 years. Unfortunately, all of his tests have come back negative, which is actually normal for him. During his last shunt failure, the CT scan and shunt series and eye pressure tests were normal, so they did exploratory surgery and found that the stint was clogged. \n\nThe doctors now are refusing to do anything more than medicating the symptoms, which is so frustrating. How do we get the doctors to listen to us? This has been going on for so long but we do not have any answers. Has anyone heard of a partial shunt failure like this? I would appreciate any advice anyone has to offer.  I have had similar problems where the CT would be within a normal range, and when they finally got in there, there was high pressure. Just to get my facts straight, you said that he has had many revisions but he still has his original valve? At least in my experience, having had over 25 revisions, they rarely do not replace the valve.  Best regards to you and your husband. When you find out what you need to do please let me know because I need to do the same im going through the same thing but im 20 and I have had 2 revisions Get a second opinion, if possible. It sounds really serious. I hope things are better by the time you read this. I believe that I have some of these symptoms. It could just be intoxication, or dyspraxia, or something. \n\nI mean I smoked some green, and I do not know if that messes with things a bit. \n\nIn the UK, when all your records are one record, and I do not know if I can still opt out of it, or it is too late, then your medical records become less involved with medical people or something. \n\nI did not even know that my health visitor 14 years ago, wrote down that I was worried about my Nan smoking around my son, in a social services file, when I thought I was telling her confidentially. \n\nI am not sure I know what confidential really means.

Anther thing, when your headache first starts, take two tablets (I used Excederine PM) and then if your headache does not stop, 1 1/2-2 hours later, take two more tablets. Continue with 2 tablets every 4 hours until the headache goes away.\n\nIF you are trying to stop drinking caffeine, or you eat a lot of chocolate, and stopped eating the chocolate, headaches are worse for the Hydro patient for the most part.\n\nTry heat or cold packs. While it does not make sense to let a patient continually suffer with headaches, due to the recent opiate crisis you will be hard-pressed to get a doctor to write for narcotics. It is sad, but it is the truth.\n\nI have been shunted for over 30 yrs and I do occasionally get headaches that would make most people curl up into a ball. I use essential oil, hot baths, etc. Sometimes a ice pack at the nape of the neck helps too. Agreed. Try quitting all meat, wait two weeks and see what happens.  Then cut out dairy, wait two weeks and see what happens.   \n\n If your issues are diet related then this  is the best thing to fix since cutting out foods is easy. Fioricet I take topomax daily, and maxalt when thier really bad. Ive headaches since the shunt was reimplanted in 1982 when i was 11 or 12 im 50 now. I havent had a day that was headache free so i just live with daily headaches 365 days a year.", "Gym and Flying with a VP Shunt? 15M and i had my shunt put in a month ago or so all going well atm, i was curious as to when i can fly or go back to gym for cardio / moderate weight lifting? My daughter has a VP shunt and we have flown together a few times. Have not been a problem from what I could tell. If the shunt is there it is there from my point of view, I would not know why flying should be a potential issue albeit a mere month in the brain. \n\nAbout gym - I have no idea. That is a question for your doctor regarding your personal situation. A shunt itself should not be a reason to avoid exercise or air travel, but again, your the details situation your case could be different. I have had my shunt in since September of last year and I waited for about 2 months before I started exercising. My advice to you would be talk to your neurosurgeon and most of all, listen to your body when you do eventually start working out. i just got my shunt a month ago aswell and just flew yesterday, all went well. just bring 2 Tylenol  or so if you need it. i am not sure specifics but if you have a programmable shunt be sure to not go through the metal detectors or body scans to avoid risk of changing your settings, tell them and they will pat you down. it is a pain but it is safe.", "Drinking and smoking with a VP Shunt Hello, i have had my VP shunt for about two weeks now and i was just curious about a couple things. \n\n\u2022 Can you still drink alcohol? if so is there a limit? \n\n\u2022 Can you still smoke marijuana?\n\nthank you. I dont drink anymore, but have after my shunt was put in. I still smoke.\n\nIf you are having symptoms I would not, but it should not be an issue otherwise.\n\nTalk to your doctor first obviously. I smoke and drink whenever I feel like it lol never a prob alright thank you. sounds good. thank you. I smoke with no issue whatsoever but drinking the hangovers seem to be worse so I just toned it down but you can still drink. Just expect a 3 day hangover if you go to hard I have had a shunt since well before I could drink. I think it was kids that finally made me give up on all-night sessions (their 6am starts do not give a crap if I have a headache!) My grown kid has a shunt. His doc told us both that drinking is bad. You get dehydrated and your brain like shrinks...causing worse headaches and shunt issues.\n\nHe had nothing to say bad about smoking. I imagine that is  because no Dr can legitimately say smoking is ok... I have only had my shunt since November but I definitely do not drink as much, the hangovers seem worse.  I do smoke too and have not had any problems Yeah just do not overdo it. I had a VP shunt put in as a baby. I am a former alcoholic. After several years of drinking heavily on a regular weekend (12 drinks in a night), I underwent a MRI 2 years ago and last year and both times my shunt was fine. DISCLAIMER: I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice. Also because this is my experience it does not mean you will have the same experience. Heavy alcohol use is bad for the brain anyway and can lead to wet brain syndrome. I once read in a guide made by the Hydrocephalus Association that some people might want to avoid drinking because hangovers can mimic shunt malfunctions. I personally drink socially and have been drunk plenty of times, but I know that if I have a headache and irritability the morning after, it is likely because I drank, not because there is something wrong with my shunt. \n\nSmoking can cause complications with anesthesia (at least cigarette smoking, not quite sure about marijuana) so I personally avoid it so that I can have the best surgical outcomes when I do need a revision. \n\nI think this is something you should discuss with your neurosurgeon. They will be most qualified to tell you whether you can use substances based on their knowledge of hydrocephalus and your personal medical history. Drinking until tipsy is usually fine, drinking until drunk is a recipe for disaster. Kind Of leaves me bed bound for at least a few days. I have smoked weed a couple times since my surgery and i felt ok the next day. Remember to just stay hydrated and you will probably be alright I have got a VP shunt and I smoke &amp; drink, no problems for me but listen to your own body. Hello!I have  had a VP Shunt for 9 years now.I have done some intense things to my head since then.Black out drunk, hit it repeatedly, and i smoke everyday.I used to get paranoid, and it is warranted.Anything that feels wrong, go get it checked out.I am trying to see what my head would look like bald, as i am drinking with a shunt!  Curiosity i swear. lolYou know your body. Be careful with medications though bbI hope you have no complications and thrive  \n\n\nEDIT: My Neurosurgeon advised NOT TO get tattoos, also to take antibiotics before and after dental exams.   \n\n\nI am planning on getting a tattoo, i will update if i have complications. I drink in moderation, I am terrified to get drunk because I have this strong feeling that my shunt will be affected\u2026 Can you elaborate on why your neurosurgeon advised not to get tattoos? Sorry it took so long to reply, my neurosurgeon said not to due to possible infection, \nI have to take antibiotics even for a dental cleaning. \nHes very protective. But if I do get a new tattoo I will take some antibiotics that I have saved from my dentist. They want me to take 4 before hand... ya naw. \n\nI save some. Shh", "Our son was diagnosed with Ventriculomegaly. Our son was born Sept 26th of 2017. My wife with gave birth to him after 5 hrs of grueling labor, in the last minutes of the labor he got stuck. They advised us that they would like to keep him overnight to monitor him since he had such a rough delivery. As parents of a two year old as well(his birth was super quick) this was all new to us. The next morning they told us that his breathing was erratic and that he was having a tough time making his own oxygen so they wanted to keep him in the nicu until they could get him stabilized. 24 hrs later he was doing great. His breathing was stabilized, they took him off of oxygen and removed his iv and mommy was going to be able to start breast feeding. 30 minutes later he developed a fever of 102.1 and they were unable to diagnose it. They advised us that we should send him to Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital to have him evaluated and give him further resources that the regional hospital we were at did not have. So 5 days after delivery he was on his way by ambulance to Children\u2019s. To spare the long 29 days we had there, he had 3 spinal taps, a ekg, multiple mri\u2019s, X-rays, and countless amounts of blood work with no diagnosis. But with the MRI they noticed brain bleeds and enlarged ventricles. So neurology came on board to review his case. They noticed that his ventricles have continued to increase in size but it has only been a slight increase. After 29 days we onward home for the first time in over a month. Since our time at home his bottle feeding has gotten really good, he is such a happy little man he is always smiling especially to the people he knows the most. The neurology specialist had us coming once a month to get head ultrasounds but our last visit she pushed us out to every two months. His fontanelle has always stayed soft, his head continues to enlarge in size(this week he is at 43 1/2 cm) it enlarges about a cm every two weeks. He is starting to get some spider veins on this sides of his forehead but overall he seems really healthy. As a parent I pray daily that he does not have to have any surgery\u2019s but at the end of the day I only want for him to be happy and healthy. Thank you guys and gals for reading our story.  My daughter has hydrocephalus, but it occurred differently than your son. She was born very premature and her ventricles do not disipate spinal fluid well. Do his ventricles drain spinal fluid like normal? Glad to hear he got to go outside and leave the hospital! That was my favorite thing to do was show mine the outside world after months in various NICUs.  That head growth sounds extremely rapid, and the fact that you are being followed by a neurologist instead of a neurosurgeon seems to be a red flag to me. My son never had any symptoms of pressure except increasing head circumference, but his brain was under pressure and he needed a shunt. I apologize it is a neurosurgeon not a neurologist. His head growth they said is normal. His is enlarged at the moment to the size of a 5 month olds head size Yeah they said his csf is flowing normal as of now but if his ventricles continue to grow they will eventually cut off the flow of csf which at that point he would have to have a shunt.  I wish you all the best! For us, the eyes were the biggest giveaway that her fluid was building up. She had the symptoms of a stomach bug, but the way she was darting her eyes back and forth, would not make much eye contact and generally was not tracking well were the most unique signs she needed help.  They told us that eyes are usually the most common indicator that CSF is building up to rapid for it flow properly. His eyes look really good as of now. The only milestone he has not been able to reach is holding his head up on his own but I think having a head the size of a 5 month old is probably a big factor for that. But overall this experience has just been scary for us because every little thing we always think something is going on.  You are preaching to the choir with the fear aspect. Interestingly mine lady has a head in something like the 5th percentile. She was able to pick her head up when she was a whopping 4 pounds. One benefit she is gotten out of this is she is very used to being handled and poked. Check ups are actually really smooth. A heal stock does not ruin her day and such. Did you get sent home with an apnea monitor or anything?  Our little man\u2019s head is in 79 percentile. He is able to pick up his head but you can yell control is not on his side. Yeah our little man is also use to check ups too. They did not send us with any apnea monitors they just told us to look for certain signs but the last visit to the neurosurgeon she did not seem to have much worry about things and she moved our appts to every months. Our last visit they told us that his ventricles were slightly enlarged but they are hoping that they will come to a stopping point and his body will grow and fill out his body to wear his head does not appear as big as it does now. I am just a worried parent because I have not ever been thru anything like this.  I think you are doing well by talking to other people like me who are going through similar things and educating yourself. I have had a terrible 2017 with hydrocephalus just being a small portion. It is very treatable though and not as uncommon as I initially thought. A lot of people have it and lead normal lives. Going to the various hospitals and seeing how tough other families have it has given me additional perspective. I tell myself if those parents can do it than so can I. Some days are easier than others. Make sure to keep an open line with your spouse because the ptsd can make you introvert. I certainly hope your struggles stop, but if things get tough you would be amazed how much strength you can summon when you need it for your family.  **update**\n\nOur son had to have surgery Friday night. We had went in for a routine check up and the doctor noticed that his eyes were showing signs that the pressure was getting to be too much. We were rushed to radiology from ultrasounds of his brain and once we seen the first scan we knew it was time. Soon after neurosurgeon\u2019s were there to meet us and tell us that surgery was a necessity. The surgery started at 9pm and was done by 10:45. He had a rough night after the surgery but by the next morning he was all smiles like nothing happened. \n\nFrom a parent stand point I am doing fairly well, the acceptance that something that was once a possibility has become a reality has been tough but I am starting to come to grips with it and I am thankful for groups like this and the education it provides.  Is no 20 and he had a brain bleed more than likely from his delivery. He was more sluggish at first and had trouble  staying awake the first few days of life.  His doctor did not diagnose him as having hydrocephalus I believe because he was meeting milestones and doing well even though his head size was very large.. Being new parents we did not question it even though his head size was off the chart after a month period at age 12 he fell  and hit his head horsing around with his sister and had a CT scan done. At that point we discovered he had a stable hydrocephalus. So basically brain bleed resolved on its own and he has not needed a shunt. He does struggle with memory and attention that I feel are probably from the hydrocephalus but I do not know that there is any way to know that for sure. He also has anxiety problems which again I am not sure if it is related to the hydrocephalus but I have to wonder.", "My dad has hydrocephalus and has been struggling with balance and dizziness lately. Is there anything I/we could do to help him with his symptoms and make having this issue any smoother for him? He is been having a really tough time lately  My old NS recommended sea sickness meds for my dizziness.  But they can cause drowsiness, so I would be cautious with them. Have him evaluated for inner ear issues. The symptoms can be the same and everyone concentrates on the hydro and misses the inner ear. When he lays down fast on his back and you check his eyes, if they are wiggling back and forth rapidly that is a sure sign, but it is usually attributed to hydrocephalus instead Have him evaluated for inner ear issues. The symptoms can be the same and everyone concentrates on the hydro and misses the inner ear. When he lays down fast on his back and you check his eyes, if they are wiggling back and forth rapidly that is a sure sign, but it is usually attributed to hydrocephalus instead I second that. For me adjusting the shunt pressure helped. it took a WHILE though of just waiting it out. it sucked bad :( If he is having balance issues he could be over draining or under draining. Balance difficulty is one of the symptoms of shunt failure. I would have him make an appointment with his neuro for a CT scan to be sure. ", "New to the group So I was diagnosed at the age of of 11 ish months? I only know the story from my mom (a well-seasoned nurse) I am now 27 yo and have been told that the issues have been resolved (I had bi-annual MRI\u2019s until the age of about 14 ish?) we never removed the shunt because as my mom said \u201cif it are not broke do not fix it\u201d especially since brain. \n\nNow I knew there was a tube in there, I can feel it behind my ear, I know the scar on my belly where the excess is, but today, 26 years later, I realized the \u201ctendon\u201d in my neck that gets tightish when I turn in a certain angle (sometimes not all the time) is actually the tube. I almost had a panic attack in the middle of a work meeting when I made the obvious realization and was so afraid I was having a relapse or whatever but it was just a shattering realization. I never wondered why the \u201cneck tendon\u201d was only on the right side of my neck and not the left. \n\nI am now typing this and it is gone? Does anyone experience the tube maybe catching on their collar bone? Am I just going nuts because I decided to start drinking coffee the last few weeks? \n\nBut also, it is kind of cool to know there is a community out there so I am saying hello! I have had hydrocephalus since I was about 2 (am currently 19) and I can assure you that you are not going crazy, I have been experiencing the pulling in my shunt for as long as I can remember. It will get caught on my collarbone, or just in my neck since my skin and muscles like to grab onto the foreign object. Sometimes when it gets stuck, I move my neck around, or if it is stuck on my collarbone I actually tend to try and pop the collarbone and the pulling will reside", "This is not mine but thought it would fit here ", "Only had one shunt replacement Hey this is my first post on this forum but so happy I found it . I am a 22 F and I have had hydrocephalus since birth but I have only had one revision when I was a year old and that is it I have had the same shunt for 20+ years has anyone else had few replacements or none at all most people with my condition I have read usually at my age have had maybe 4 or 5. Revisions or replacements I have only had one revision at 2 weeks old after the one installed at birth failed...25 female I am 22 I have had 7. 3 of them were last year and I might have to have another one soon Most people would have revisions because they would need to change the length or position of tubing as you have grown.\n\nIf you end up going in for a new one, see if you can get a programmable shunt.\n\nMy partner has surgery 4 weeks ago and last week when the pains set back in they just adjusted it to a more appropriate flow rate without surgery and she is recovered perfectly. \n\nWish she had that several surgeries ago... Installed at 10 weeks old in mid-'86, now 34 years old with 0 revisions.\n\nI did have some potential issues at age 3 (screaming, rolling around, holding my head in pain), but they were resolved by the time my parents got me to the doctor. And at age 22 I also had a few months of weird fuzzy/tingly headaches which only resolved after I had a CT head scan, but otherwise no issues at all and thankfully no real impact on my life either. I am 29 and I have had 28 shunt revisions. I think it really is just about luck with these shunts. They are just a tube that is in the body that can get clogged. When they get clogged they have to be replaced. There is studies being done that show the placement of the shunt makes a huge difference. It could be luck or it could be the shunt is in the best possible position or your body has learnt to compensate,but that is rare.  Hopefully you may go another 20. You have not had many symptoms?

Any good organization recommendations or social media groups? Max Greenfield (actor) does a pretty good job of promoting awareness. Depends where you live etc sometimes. Pretty good here in the uk with charity groups etc. Mines linked to brain tumour so tend to merge the two", "Are there any benefits to a non programmable shunt compared to a programmable shunt? I have a non programmable shunt and I have always wondered why non programmable shunts are even a thing like being able to control the pressure seems to have so many benefits \ud83d\ude02\n\nFor reference I had a severe brain bleed which led to hydro - does the type of injury determine what type of shunt someone has?\nI was shunted in 2004 so idk maybe they were not popular then lol I vaguely remember being told that they try non programmable first by default and if revision is needed due to over drainage they switch to programmable. I almost switched to programmable a year ago due to severe migraines but literally 2 minutes before my surgery they cancelled it as they suspected my migraines were unrelated to the shunt. I have had a revision which is also non programmable I was born with hydrocephalus and had a non-programmable shunt put in in 2000 at 8 months old. I do not know much beyond that, but I personally do not think I would see much benefit from having my pressure changed. It is never even been mentioned to me before, and I only learned about programmable shunts through this subreddit. So my hypotheses based on all that are A) programmable shunts did not exist back then, B) they did exist but they were prohibitively expensive, C) neither of our conditions warranted putting in a programmable shunt when a non-programmable one would suffice, or D) we were both scammed. Fair, as I said I only vaguely remember (I was on lots of strong medication so memory is fuzzy). My valve is set to high as I had a lot of swelling which I think was why they considered the switch to programmable as more control of drainage. When I recovered and was able to research shunt surgery I did wonder why they did not choose programmable. Programmable shunts are useful at initial diagnosis just because everyone is brain likes to sit at different pressures and it may take a couple adjustments to find the right setting (at least in my experience).  Device-wise though they have to be more complicated and usually the more complicated something is the more likely it is to break.  At my last revision they put in a non-programmable shunt because my setting had not changed for 10+ years.  I am hoping this one lasts longer than the 12 years my programmable shunt lasted. Programmable sucks when it is 6 month old and you have to go through the first 6 ish years of life (currently at 3) and you have to be afraid of magnets I have had 17 revisions and up until my last revision in 2012 I have always had non programmable shunts. The doc who did the last revision said he always used programmables, but my neuro told me that in my case it probably did not matter if the shunt was programmable or not.  Since I have had the programmable I have never had to change settings. Ive had a programmable one since i was 10 currently 23 had a revision at 22. Yeah magnets suck but i actually  have not had much issues other than me literally outgrowing the cath. The shunt is the same the revision was for the cath as the cyst changed with age. The adjustable nature has happend a few times where i needed different settings. Had a chiari malformation decompressed and the shunt needed to be more closed after. Than the revision for the cath happend and it needed to open back up due to displacement of a longer cath. Over all its down to the patient. For me programmable was by far the best rout and has prevented allot of revisions. I am not sure if you can have MRI\u2019s with a programmable one. My last MRI they asked which one it was so I am guessing the magnetic field would mess with a programmable one. Yes. I had to switch to programmable after a scare in 2017-2018 because of over draining I am now in a medical journal because I was misdiagnosed by the Mayo Clinic with Encephalitis. I had neuropsychiatric symptoms which I had never previously experienced.", "How to bring up your hydrocephalus with your partner? So I have always been pretty embarrassed of my hydrocephalus and have told almost nobody I have it outside my family. Why this makes me embarrassed, idk, I know it is irrational but its my issue. Anyway I have been seeing someone for about six months now, we have been talking about moving in together, and I have not told him about it yet. My hydrocephalus doesnt really impact my day-to-day life at all, but I do think this is something he should know. How should I go about bringing this up ? What if he gets pissed I did not tell him sooner? Share it! Do you have any revision scars? That is how my wife and I waded into the discussion. I cannot imagine someone being upset, but for the purposes of a long term relationship, you may need a revision and that is something they would need to cover in advance. No shame in being a shunt buddy, we can do anything, be proud of being you! I told my husband while we were dating but he already knew something was a little different.  I explained to him how weather changes effect me sometimes and the symptoms to watch out for if I start gradually  seeming off for a month or so. Now he is aware and I told him I have not had a surgery in a really long time, but that it is always a possibility.  Do not be embarrassed of your Hydrocephalus. Be happy that you are able to advocate and educate people on it Oh I do not know - you should make some really outlandish stories for your scars and have a little fun with it. You only get these opportunities a few times ! \n\nMy grandfather used to describe my scars as \"the belly where the pig bit yer\". We are 10x more preoccupied with how are shunt/scars look than others. No one cares. It is weird at first, but people instantly get over it. It is more something we build up in our heads. In reality, nobody cares!  I would tell your partner asap. I started dating my bf when I was 18 (I am 28) and he ended up saving my life. For 7 years I would get the debilitating headaches that would radiate down my back and cause me to throw up and black out. My neurosurgeon at the time was Ben Carson who said my shunt was fine and that due to my history of depression I was probably just making it up or was in fact crazy. I went to so many doctors and neurologist but everyone kept saying I was crazy. My boyfriend watched me day after day throw up like the exorcist and cry myself to sleep. He went to our uni library and did his own medical research about hydrocephalus matching my symptoms with peer reviewed medical articles. He was convinced my shunt was overdraining and found a neurosurgeon close by and begged me to give doctors one more chance. Turned out he was right and saved my life. \n\nSide note: when I met him I was instantly infatuated and desperate to keep the conversation going when we hit a lull I asked him if he wanted to feel my tube. It was true love at first tube touch.  Now that is a pick up line I never thought of! I joke around with people and tell them I have got a needle in my brain and a tube all the way to my stomach.

I am far to scared of hospital things related, i can walk in on one, but seeing blood, syringes, or (idk what is its name in english) catheters makes my arms weak. It all goes back to when i was hospitalized (8 times now) and when a nurse could not find my vein so they poked me 10 times in each arm, and i can still remember how they moved the syringe while inside of my arm to find the vein. I do not have PTSD from the surgeries themselves cause I had a great support system at the time, but I have had to struggle with debilitating health anxiety.

I have really bad depression since my nine surgeries. It is a combo of the actual surgeries and the pain killers. Be careful with them I get panic attacks when my head hurts for more than a day bc I was in a coma for a little under a week after my last surgeries. To pile on to that, I had 5 surgeries during that time at the hospital which was roughly 6 weeks. Omg yes! I sometimes wake up to my left arm straight and stiff like I had it at the hospital when I had an IV. When this happens I have to calm myself down and remind myself that I am at home with a normal pressure level on my brain and none of my shunts have malfunctioned or I would be vomiting profusely. (I have my hydrocephalus treated by 3 VP shunts 2 non-programmable and 1 programmable) Waking up to a panic attack is one of the furthest Things from fun I would say that counts.. it is a post trauma response,so.

Threw me right into a panic attack as I attempted to dodge blocks that were not actually there. My poor mother had to watch me until it wore off. Thank God I was in the hospital. Not clinical ptsd, but everything happened so fast and I was thrown right back into school. I did not have time to process it. I went through years of no insurance (thanks USA) and every little possible symptom caused me to spiral all the time. Still spiral from time to time.

I would say I have a minor case of PSTD. When I was a teenager I once had 7 surgeries in five months. For years afterwards I would wake up panting because I had the nightmare that I was having surgery, or a spinal tap. I also could not look my surgeon in the eye for years because I was too afraid of him. When I learned what PTSD was after 9/11 I though that was me. Fortunately, it has gotten better over the years. I have hydrocephalus and CPTSD. (Lucky enough to be born with a stage IV brain tumor into an extremely poor and abusive household.)

I imagine it just depends on how fast my brain would swell from fluid accumulation? really do not want to get a CAT scan just to be told I am okay and a hypochondriac. Though i am due for one I guess, my last check up and scan was in December last year, I am in college and on my mom's insurance, but it is not great insurance and neither of us have any money right now. My family lives paycheck to paycheck and I live on my own. I could just be fatigued from lack of sleep, but i feel light headed and there is soreness around my shunt so I am just concerned. I think its better to have it checked, especially if you were on due for one anyway. If its really broken your symptoms may progress suddenly which may be even bad as you write you live on your own.\n\nJust curious: May i ask how much you have to pay for a CT of your head? Here in Germany its usually covered by any insurance, but even if you have to pay for it on your own its \"only\" about 170 \u20ac. If you are paying out of pocket here in the US, a head CAT scan is $1,500-$8,000 and really can cost up to $10,000. It just depends on the facility and how many pics they take. \n\nAs for OP, I second getting it checked just in case. At most places you can talk to the people at the reception desk and set up a payment plan. I will never understand why such examinations are so expensive in the US. Its the same xray machines and i do not think the doctors salaries will differ that much. I do believe with my mom's insurance we still wound up paying upward of $500, but i may be wrong. I do not think it would be that broken, it was just a bump on the head. The only thing I have ever been a hypochondriac about is my hydrocephalus, but that is again because I have never experienced a need for revision YET. I know it will happen, and it is just scary that i do not know what to look for and will not know until it is too late. I should have phrased better, I do live with my fianc\u00e9. But he is here for two weeks at a time and gone for four, and my sister and I check up on each other daily. So I do think I can wait it out Yeah, none of us do I suppose if i start having symptoms I will. The soreness subsided and I ate something and feel better. So i could have just been having bad anxiety and I am okay. I am a hypochondriac when it comes to my shunt since I have never experienced a shunt failure yet and i know that it is bound to happen sooner or later. Heeeey! Also 19, and have had a shunt since a couple months after birth! \ud83d\ude04 given that it is been atleast 5 hours, I am sure your shunt is fine. I have a VP shunt, which has failed, and I have also accidentally broken multiple times, I am not sure about other types of shunts, but im pretty sure you would be experiencing something unpleasant by now. Typically nasuea and heavy drowsiness. If you shunt malfunctions, you will most definitely know, in which case, I would recommend calling 911 if you are alone, incase you were to pass out while driving yourself. Hi, that is actually awesome to meet someone my age with it! Less awesome that you have it and have had complications. I have never met someone my age with it, I am sorry you have had to experience so many revisions though. It sounds painful and unpleasant. I am terrified of the day i need a revision and would love to have someone around to give me guidance if you want to pm me! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 In a perfect world you would get it checked. It is been a while like you have stated. In general though, shunts are supposedly pretty durable. My daughters neurosurgeon said he has seen just a couple broken shunts and they were from blows so severe he believed the shunts actually prevented skull fractures. I have taken a few whacks to the shunt (it is on top of my head so I sometimes hit it on car doorways) and am usually fine afterwards. My old shunt was at the base of my neck and I once fell backwards on a trampoline and hit it on one of the springs around the edge of the trampoline and noticed within a few days that something was off and ended up needing surgery. It is tough when insurance will not support your needs, but I would say maybe wait and see how you feel. Is there anyone at all who can check in on you from time to time just in case of an emergency? It is incredibly unfortunate, but that is just how my life is! Around 6 brain surgeries! The last one was in 2016, which was the cause of me growing too fast for my shunt cord to catch up. \ud83d\ude06 if you are being serious, I would genuinely enjoy that! Or if you just want a friend to chat with, I would be perfectly fine with that, too! Do not be afraid to message me if you want, making new friends is always nice, and honestly, internet friends sometimes make better friends than irl ones. They were concerned about the potential of me outgrowing mine. But now I am done growing the only point of concern is just the tube in my brain is *just barely* long enough to get to the ventricle. One doctor said this was problematic because if i got a concussion it could move out of place. The next one said it was not an issue because scar tissue has essentially sealed it in. So i dunno what to believe. I do feel completely fine and it is been two days so i think i just had a caffeine induced anxiety episode lol. I will shoot a message! That is incredible. It makes sense. I would assume medical devices are made to be durable like that because people are just prone to accidents sometime I have family and friends, i made them all aware of the incident and gave them a list of general symptoms to look for and told them if i experience them do not let me write it off as something it is not. It is just so scary not knowing how I am going to be affected if i will be.\n\nI have never heard of a shunt in those places! Mine is behind my ear. I have gotten hit on top of the head so many times if i had a placement there I would definitely have needed a few revisions by now. Is that your choice to have it placed there? Or is it due to where your fluid accumulation is? I have actually done this to myself and broken it, I hit my head on a metal bar because I did not duck down far enough and my shunt was the highest point of my head apparently. I had really clear concussion symptoms. Headache, nausea, blurred vision, dizziness, forgetfulness ect. I could get by and keep doing things but it was hard. If you are not noticing anything then I would say you are okay.\n\nEdit: I am female and was 23 at the time too so very similar, I am 30 now. Ouch I am sorry to hear that happened to you. I think I am in the clear, thank you for taking the time to respond &lt;3 I have found shunts to be pretty resilient, but if you are concerned speak with your surgeon. They will be the experts on the types of symptoms you should be concerned about. I think hydrocephalus makes all of us hypochondriacs. You are not the only one. ", "At what age where you diagnosed with Hydrocephalus?  3 months  5 months We included this question in the survey we use for all the VIP posters at the Denver HA walk (in 10 hours from now!). Most were in utero or within a month of birth.\n\nMy daughter was born 16 weeks premature and developed meningitis at about a week old, and was shunted about 6 weeks later.  Before I was born.... 10 months 28 years old, still unshunted because mine was arrested at birth, according to my previous doc (Michael Williams) \n\nI have a narrow aqueduct between 3rd and 4th ventricle but since I am stable, no need to operate, and may never need an operation.\n\nI walk a bit funny due to nerve damage, and I pee more often than most, but unless you paid attention you probably would not notice.  No cognitive impairment, unless you count getting a PhD and torturing myself for 8 years. Would you mind if I messaged you about some questions i have? no worries dude, feel free too\n\nnow is a good time because i am at home for a few more weeks on paternity leave. 11 months. Iirc I was the latest diagnosis my neurosurgeon had seen (if anyone here lives in or around Indianapolis, shout out Dr. Boaz). My case is somewhat 'mild' from what I know. My first shunt lasted 17 years. The late diagnosis did not seem to be an issue until my teens when I discovered my cognitive impairment. I am currently 5 years operation free at the moment though and I could not be happier about that. Congratulations on being 5 years operation free :)  I was diagnosed at birth and had my first shunt placed at 1 month old. I had over 30 shunt revisions up until the age of three. Question: does anyone experience ringing in their ears or lack of coordination? I would love to connect with someone who experiences the same things and would love to talk about those experiences. Around 13 years old. Funny enough it was the mall eye examiner who pushed for an MRI. I was also diagnosed at birth, I have very poor coordination, I have the ringing in the ears, high frequency issues, constant headaches, I have luckily only had 5 surguries. The Dr told me at 11 that I would always be dealing with headaches.  How did you get diagnosed?  random ct sinus scan I was 3 weeks old. That was when I had my first surgery.  How many after 3? ", "My 66 yr old mother was recently diagnosed with hydrocephalus. She also has an acoustic neuroma (benign brain tumor) that will receive radiation treatment to stop the growth. Cisternogram shows that it is not NPH and neurosurgeon says he rarely shunts for non-NPH. More in comment post. The acoustic neuroma will receive radiation over 3 treatments via CyberKnife to stop the growth. Neurosurgeon stated in his notes that excess protein from the neuroma could possibly be causing the hydrocephalus... but if the radiation treatment only stops the growth of the tumor, is this it then? Will she have memory loss, walking issues, no will to do anything, and incontinence for the rest of her life? I am the one caring for her, and the news from the radio-oncologist that the tumor will only be slowed and not reduced in size was devastating. Is this seriously it? I have hydrocephalus and am shunted. Each patient is different. However I can say I only have walking issues on low/high pressure days. I do not have incontinence but my brain does tend to delay signals of needing to use the restroom (meaning I can go from not needing to go to needing to go now). My memory is awful. I have pretty severe aphasia (I mix up words constantly). \n\nThere is no way to know what her symptoms will be like until she is healed from the procedure. Be patient. Be understanding. Hydrocephalus is hell at time. Between the headaches and the added issues above it can be very disheartening for the patient. \n\nWell wishes and blessings sent to you both! I appreciate you sharing your experience with this so much. Thank you. I am worried that the doctor will not shunt at all since he says it is not NPH, and that there will be no relief of symptoms. Her short term memory loss is pretty bad, and she does not seem to have motivation to do activities she once liked. Despite being on antidepressants and my attempts to get her into art (she is an artist), everything seems to fall flat. I am terrified that this is how it is going to be forever. Have they said what her ventricles look like? It is odd they do not want to shunt. Has she gotten a second opinion? My hydrocephalus was caused by a benign brain tumor called a colloid cyst. It is very slow growing and it took 32 years to become an issue but I was shunted immediately. Granted my situation was pretty emergent and my brain was dying. \n\nThe lethargy is normal with hydrocephalus. We are tired all the damn time. My activity comes in waves. Most days I am content sitting on the couch. Some days I am ready to take on the world and have 47 different projects going. The brain is a fickle organ. It runs the show and were just along for the ride. No, the neurosurgeon did not indicate the condition of the ventricles, or maybe I was trying to wrap my head around everything and missed it. He did indicate in his report that the excess protein created by the neuroma could cause the hydrocephalus under the circumstances... so I suppose if the tumor stays as is, the condition should not worsen, but if it shrinks, then maybe? We will be seeing the neurologist early next month, who can hopefully give us some better insight and offer some solutions.\n\nAgain, I really appreciate you giving me insight on your experience with this. I do not get a whole lot of information from my mom on symptoms other than the ones that are obvious. Have you thought of contacting another Neurosurgeon, someone that specializes in NPH?\n\nI too have hydrocephalus (not NPH) and getting another opinon from someone else would be my next best bet.) \n\nI would go to the Hydrocephalus Association's website and ask who the best neurosurgeon for NPH would be. Sometimes \"the best\" neursurgeon for this kind of thing will reveiw your mom's records first before they agree to see you, ,possibly saving you a lot of time and travel as well.", "EVD pressure headache Hi everyone! I currently have an EVD and am awaiting surgery, but today the nurse shut off the drainage so that fluid can build up in my head and the ventricles will be larger for surgery. Unfortunately, I have a HUGE pressure headache, and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to get rid of it naturally, since I cannot take any migraine medication. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Ask then to unclamp the shunt to reduce the pressure and relieve the headache. Then clamp it back off. It is what my neurosurgeon did before he left the hospital for the night before my shunt was replaced the next day.", "Terrible non-positional headaches after adjustment Hi, I hope you all are not tired of my posts. It is 11pm on a sunday night and I am going to call my neurosurgery team asap tomorrow about this, but until then I am hoping  anyone can weigh in on this. \nI had my shunt adjusted friday, felt great on the 5 hour ride home-It was the first time I had not had a headache since the last adjustment- and then the headache started creeping back in. Now 2 days later it feels like something is wrong and if it does not clear up I want to go to the ER. It feels similar to the spinal tap headache I have had, except it is not positional, it is all the time. Sort of like my pre shunt hydro symptoms. I am having moments of cognitive difficulties likeIm in slow motion and everything else is too fast, almost like confusion, when the pain spikes. \nThe thing that makes me worry is that... I have already been on this setting (2.0) and the same thing happened last time. But the next one up (1.5) causes positional headaches and other symptoms that make me not functional. \n\nI have had an MRI friday where I was adjusted same day, a shunt series x-ray and CT. All images look good and my slit ventricles that prolonged untreated hydrocephalus caused have actually opened to a healthier size. I have not had a shunt tap test or anything more invasive than images yet, and my NP usually says to wait the full 2 weeks to adjust before calling about negative symptoms but I do not know if I can wait. I just feel very sick and wrong. I have no idea what is next for me and I am worrying bc the neuros in my city are not that great, even (especially) in the ER. \n\nMy first shunt setting was 1.5 when I had the surgery in Jan, then 2.0 in april, back to 1.5 in may and now 2.0 again. I feel like maybe a shunt is not the right answer if it is not working, and then what if it is clogged or something? It already migrated over my collarbone and is stiff from there up to my ear. It hurts where it goes into my skull, and I have felt it move which caused a LOT of pain. I am wondering if it is related to the veins in my brain somehow because of my symptoms, but I am N.A.D. and my apparent veinous malformation in my brain is apparently benign/ just there/ incidental. Or if most of this is just post-op suffering, but idk because it is a different recovery than my craniotomy. It is so easy to worry when feeling like this, has anyone gone through anything similar? My hydro was caused by a brain tumor/cyst last year and my shunt is vp medtronic strata 2 or nsc valve.", "Getting Ready for September! ", "This is a brain/hydrocephalus related playlist that I started around the time I made a Spotify account 5 or 6 years ago. A good amount of the songs are pretty vague, and one or two are mean spirited but it is obvious in the titles. Suggestions are welcome.  Should add Jaded after Brain Stew.  ( Brain Damage: Pink Floyd\n\nTrip at the Brain: Suicidal Tendencies\n\nWater on the Brain: The Hollies Nasty Girl by Vanity 6 \"I guess she is just used to sailors, I think she is got water on the brain\" holy shit this is hilarious. followed immediately", "Common Symptoms? ANY REPLIES APPRECIATED I have two \"symptoms\" that I am concerned could be related to my shunt.  \nMy background: First shunt placed 3 weeks after birth after being born a day short of two months early(in '95 if that makes a difference). At two years old my shunt malfunctioned and a new one was installed (could not think of a better word). This is the shunt I have now. It is a CODMAN HIKIM PROGRAMABLE shunt.   \nMy first 'symptom' that is a concern of mine is \"blind spots in vision\" when I turn my head. I have been to a neurosurgeon and he said everything is fine except I might have a bit of slit ventricle syndrome. I have also been to a ophthalmologist. He also said nothing wrong with my eyes.  \nMy second symptom of concern is buzzing around the valve when I change from sitting to standing or laying to sitting. Not every time but often. I assume its its a pressure change but i wanted to know if anyone else experiences this.  \nSIDE NOTE: If anyone has been told they have Slit Ventricle syndrome I would like to hear some of your experiences. I do not remember what the neurosurgeon told me about it.  The vision thing idk,but the the buzzing is just your shunt draining. I have heard buzzing before as well and freaked out. Then I found out that it is normal Awesome Thank you. I figured but It had been bugging me. Get your eyes checked.  The director or even optometrist will be able to immediately tell of there is pressure building behind your eye.  \n\nWhen everything checks out-ok, ignore symptoms like you described..,we are an odd bunch, life is abnormal for us but manageable when we are not in fear of revisions.  \n\nHope this helps. Im definitely used to the buzzing, I cannot imagine that is not what you are hearing, no worry would be my guess. Over draining is bad. Once you have slit vents ,it will be very difficult to get them back to normal.  I agree with the advice being given. What level is your shunt on? Perhaps get it adjusted. This is helpful, I appreciate it. I had the pressure in my eyes checked and they said all good. It just feels really scary when I see (or do not see) in those spots. I figured it was just time to decide this is my normal but I decided I would try here first. I have no idea what level its on. As far as I know it has not been changed since I was 2 or 3. I remember the neurosurgeon mentioning it looked like slit ventricle syndrome but he did not mention needing to fix anything. Even said no need for more appointments unless something new arises. (Which was weird for me because since that revision when I was 2 I had had yearly visits to check everything was good until I was 19) Is this something I should try to talk to another neurosurgeon about then? Like a second opinion? Or like the above replies, ignore it all now? Have they mentioned sending you to a neurologist in case the vision thing is being caused by something else? Also are you aware they just barely started using programmable shunts when you got yours? I think if you hear the shunt buzzing (which is normal) it is some proof that the shunt is working. Every time I have had a shunt work, I hear it buzzing, and when it begins to fail / headaches return, I noticed the buzzing disappears. If you do not have constant or frequent headaches, I doubt you have slit ventricle syndrome, more so just slit-like ventricles from the lack of over drainage protection on the HAKIM, but I am no doctor... that is just what happened with me. \n\nI had a HAKIM as well, and it last me about 7 years, but it overdrained a lot, they had to put in a anti siphon device during my next revision. It is all normal.  \n\nWe are not suppose to be alive, hydro patients survive where treatment is available and they do not survive elsewhere.  It is serious stuff.  \n\nI have the following:\nSee tracers/floaters \nSmell a funny odour in the mri\nHave terrible balance\nAm paranoid every time I have a slight headache \nCheck the room when I wake up, I have woken up in the hospital several times with a shut revision. \n\n... it is been 30 years since my last revision.  I just laugh at myself and remember that I am lucky to be alive, albeit a basket case-some days. Definitely needs to be adjusted. Your csf flow is different at times. I would 110% recommend a second opinion. They most likely will not operate based on those symptoms. But you need to do something. No, I have been going to doctors for low income for awhile and unfortunately that seems to go along with them not caring....at least in my experience.  \nYup, I am aware. One of the reasons I am abit worried about issues. Ohh\\~ Thank you for your reply,it helps me thank you. Ok, Thank you for your reply! No medical insurance then? Just through the state which does not allow for much I guess.. Do you have a general practitioner that seems to be doing the same. Also are you in the US?

And the dr.s here were not helping saying it was mental. Lol \nI am not going to lie, it is still scary.  \nReal Neuro said when he was doing the surgery and he went to remove the tip from the 1st shunt it was really stuck in the brain. He said he had to place the new shunt in the other ventricle side. So now I have two tips. And 1 reservoir. \nBut I will ask him. Eventually If all the tips get stuck how many can the brain hold!? \nI do not think 1 week or 1 month would have changed that. You are not dumb, never say this to yourself or in writing or to anyone else. I think you are a rockstar and an awesome person.\n\nInteresting that they left the other reservoir in your head, who is better than one I guess:) They left the tip part only. Like in the ventricle that is behind my left eyeball. \nBut still 1 reservoir. Yea.  Based on what I recall, it is just too dangerous to operate in such a small area like inside the ventricles.  They can do it, but it is not worth the risk/benefit.

I have Chiari (base of brain slumps into spinal column - easiest description for me to come up with) and had surgery to correct it.  It left me with chronic hydrocephalus that required an lp shunt.  My head pressure (as I call it) was so severe it popped my brain surgery sutures and caused the CSF to pool in the back of my head's tissues and caused the docs to put in a shunt to move the flow of CSF.  It is been three years and everything seemed alright until recently.  I am starting to get the familiar pressure behind my eyes (vision changing slightly, again); tightness of the skull \"feeling\" and pounding heart/shortness of breath upon exertion.  I am thinking I need to get either an lumbar puncture to check pressure; and/or ct scan to check my shunt??  I hate to think this is a problem. It is been going on for a couple weeks.  Any advice? ", "COVID-19 Vaccine (Moderna) Not sure if this would be helpful for anyone but I thought I would document my experience getting the Moderna vaccine.  I am lucky enough that hydrocephalus is the only health condition that affects me on a regular basis (no headaches, just conscious of incisions and the occasional revision).  \n\nFirst off, I live in Pennsylvania which has done a horrendous job of getting the vaccine distributed.  PA is still officially on the first part of the first phase of the rollout which includes anyone 65 years and older and a handful of conditions.  There is no centralized place to sign up and schedule.  Despite this, providers know they need to get the vaccine so you just have to gamble to see if you can get scheduled or on a callback list.  Luckily, when I called UPMC (I live in the suburbs of Pittsburgh) and told them I had hydrocephalus with a VA shunt the person scheduled me right away.  Incredibly there were several appointment slots available the next day.\n\nSo I got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine this morning.  It is now evening and the side effects have been minimal.  My arm is a bit sore and through the course of the day there is been slight fatigue settling in.  I will try to update here as I go through the next day to report any symptoms.\n\nSo have no fear, get the vaccine and hopefully we can get back to some semblance of normalcy. Awesome! Not sure what everyone else\u2019s states are like, but my spouse and I actually qualified for vaccines because we are the full time care givers to our child, who has hydrocephalus. One of the few perks of us all ending up in or more likely to end up in a hospital is that the powers that be want us vaccinated should we have to make that ER trip? I cannot say I have enjoyed having hydrocephalus but yeah, take advantage when you can. I have hydrocephalus and had a vp shunt 9 months ago. I got the vaccine today and I am doing well. I am 51.\nI know a lot of people that have had the vaccine now. Its safe I encourage people to get it. That is great to hear.  Which variant of the vaccine did you get?

I swear sometimes I am lying down in bed with my head against the pillow and I \"hear\"/feel like a whirring inside my head where the shunt is. Anybody else experience that? No, but when I tap my chest I can hear the chord jiggle in my brain. I was worried I was the only one! I kind of figured it was a draining of fluid, but I definitely hear it. Haha nice, I can rub my neck and do the same thing! Haha same! I am glad it is not just me. I do not think I hear every day though, only when it is like actively draining, which is usually accompanied by some light symptoms. Does that sound right to you? I do not get symptoms or if I do they are so light and common I do not notice them, but I definite hear it Nice, cheers! I have got an old school one circa 1990 and I am sure I can feel it when there is a pressure release. Could be my imagination though - who knows. My wife says she knows the days she would have had horrible migraines when she feels her VP shunt draining significantly. \n\nI am not sure if feel, but she says often that she hears rushing like water moving in her right ear. She is 16 months in so far. Yes, I hear/feel my shunt sometimes too! Nice to know that I am not the only one. Yes, it is very weird.  Not the draining specifically, but I know when  the days will be tough a couple days before a weather change from warmer to cooler weather. ", "Scans are 'normal', but I am in agony. It feels like a kick drum pedal hitting directly over my shunt non-stop.  I have been in quite a bit of pain since Monday or so and ended up going to emerge Tuesday night, they did a basic CT and medicated with a morphine/toradol mix that did not do a damn thing, sending me home still in agony around 3am.  I am waiting to hear back from a neuro at the hospital closest to where I live that was supposed to be arranged from another ER visit about a month ago.  I am currently medicating with medical cannabis on a pretty constant basis just to keep from putting my head through the wall... I am so exhausted by dealing with this. I am sorry you are going through so much pain. Does your neuro want to replace the shunt? Are you having pain only when laying down or standing up? I have not had an appointment with this neuro yet, so not sure what they will say. the pain is constant regardless of position. My daughter had shunt failure symptoms a month ago. Her scans were all normal and ventricles looked fine. Three days later her symptoms resurfaced and scan should enlarged ventricles. She got a revision due to a clogged tube and was back to normal after surgery. I think shunt failures may not always show up during initial scans after symptoms arise. Sorry you are not feeling well.  Are they comparing your CT scans to your healthy baseline? They might not be noticing the failure if they do not have something to compare it to. I have had multiple scans over the past few years due to dealing with near constant headaches, many of which occur directly at the shunt site (any time it is one of those, I tend to get it looked into just to be safe)", "Mental health and hydrocephalus Hi! I wanted to talk to other people with hydrocephalus about mental health struggles they have had or learning disabilities. I come from a family that does not believe in mental health. The \u201csuck it up\u201d method is how my dad got through things. In my adulthood, I am now battling all the mental health issues I have always suffered with not even knowing what was going on. I have ADD, anxiety, and depression as well as severe PMDD. In school, I struggled to do well and had to work a lot harder than my friends and never understood why. I had a lot of trouble, but I managed to get a (useless lol) college degree. Now, I combat depression and anxiety attacks as well as a complete lack of concentration if I do not take my ADD medicine and horrible anxiety attacks if I do not take my SSRI. I have gone two years without any medicine, but my anxiety attacks were too much to handle. Although the medicine helps, I am still left with hours of uneasiness to the point where I am afraid to leave the house or work overly stresses me out. I am a very social person, so this is weird for me. I have had two brain surgeries in the past 3 years, but I am coming up on 3 years with my current shunt. I would just like to talk to others who have experienced mental health issues with hydrocephalus. Here is to hoping our shunts do not break!\u2764\ufe0f I fought mental health issues before I was diagnosed and still do today. It is not been easy. But I would not trade where I am today for anything. Thanks for replying. I struggle with hating myself over my mental issues. I grew up in a home where psychiatric issues could be worked through by the \u201csick it up\u201d method, and I have guilt about taking medicine for it even though I need it.  I used to be that way about meds. Now I do not care. I will do whatever it takes to stay healthy and healing. This sounds exactly like what I have been experiencing throughout my life. I have only had a few revisions in my life but the last one that I had back in 2011 led me to a really bad Staph infection and because of that things have never been normal. I get really bad daily migraines and other symptoms regularly now. I have recently been diagnosed with Anxiety/Panic disorder which does not really help my situation. I do not want to go into complete detail as it would take forever for me to type it all out and it would be a really use response. If you want to talk I would absolutely love to. I was on medication for a year almost before stuff started getting better(or so I thought). Went back to my Dr. today and was told that I need to go back on medication as all my Anxiety and all my depression is starting to come back again. I would love to hear more about it!

I have a VP shunt.  \n\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has headaches preceding rain. I seem to get around 2 days notice of an incoming storm. Is this common? Very common. When storms occur there is a change in barometric pressure which for someone with a shunt can affect the way the CSF flows through it. Since the shunt works off pressure. For me it is not always a headache, but usually like a pressure feeling or a kind of haziness in my thinking. Oh yeah, I am definitely familiar with the hazy thinking that comes with it. Seems like the best thing I have found to do when I get it is something mindless ... video games or something. When I have it, I can hardly even follow movie plots. It is very common. I do not get them, but I know a lot of people do. Some people get them even without a shunt. They say it is caused by the change in atmospheric pressure.  I get a pretty severe headache at the transition from cool spring weather to hot summer weather.   I do. I just got one Tuesday.", "Headaches I developed hydrocephalus after I needed brain surgery to remove a benign tumor (everything is fine now.) I know the difference between hydrocephalus headaches and normal headaches. I know it is common to get headaches after getting a shunt placed because your body has to adjust to a piece of equipment in it. What is annoying is that nothing can take away these headaches. I was taking Tylenol which did nothing then switched to Motrin, which helps, but does not take the headache away. Are there any other pain relief meds I can try to take the headaches away? They are not too bad ... more of an annoyance. But I would rather not have a headache than have one. Have you tried Nurofen (Ibuprofen)? Idk if it will work for you, but I tried it for a few days, and I left off using it because the relief only lasted for like an hour or so Not a perfect solution but I find caffeine sometimes helps me...\nHave you tried track them to see if there is anything that makes it worse, position, food, weather. I am in the exact same boat. Except luckily, I do not get headaches. Can I message you about your experience sure Yeah, weather seems to he a factor. I have bad allergies and live on the east coast, so change in weather happens frequently and screws up my allergies. Not much I can do about it.. No, I have only tried motrin and tylenol.\nMotrin kind of helps with relief, tylenol does nothing for me. Caffeine helps me, too. The headache clinic here wants me to stop using Caffeine completely. I have also tried CBD oil, which helps.", "Will a VP shunt always need to be replaced? Hello everyone! \nI am new to this community. Just got diagnosed with hydrocephalus a month ago. I had my VP shunt inserted, but reading all the entries online I have realized that many people are getting there shunts replaced or revised. Should I expect this to happen to me? \nAlso side note. Does anyone else feel a pulling from their shunt when you turn your head? I hate turning my head to the right because I can feel the shunt pull. Will that ever go away? \n\nThank you. And I am really happy to have found the community. I have been a bit lost as to everything with hydrocephalus. Yes, shunts have a shelf-life and HAVE to be replaced when they do not work anymore (or have a defect). Shunts are the things that get rid of that spinal fluid in the brain  and when they do not know properly... oh boy, you can be prepared for hell.\n\n Shunt tubes are the same - they need to be replaced, if anything happens: defective tube, the tube has a clot (I often get tubes clotted by lime after 3-4 years) or the tube rips over and spinal fluid starts to leak out (also happened to me). Hi Smokey, welcome to the community! \n\nI have a VP shunt and I have had the same one implanted since about mid 2009. I had three revisions in that year, as they all miraculously failed, one after the other. So I have not had any issues with my current one since. \n\nIdeally, a VP shunt lasts about a decade or so. But because it is just simple machinery, it is not a matter of when it will fail but when. This is not meant to scare you, it is just a reality. There is no set timeline for the lifetime of a shunt. It is just a combination of luck and knowing the symptoms of shunt failure. \n\nNow, onto your question about the tugging sensation you feel... that varies from person to person. Your body will take some getting used to having a tube placed in it. But normally it is not a sign of any immediate danger. If it persists however, talk to your neurologist. :) \n\nFeel free to PM me, \n\nI would love to chat. \n\nSincerely, \nA 21 year old college senior, living with Hydrocephalus, and applying to Law School in the Spring Hi!\n\nI have a non-functioning shunt as my hydrocephalus was obstructive and thus fixed by an operation, but I do feel that pulling you describe. I think it is just a matter of getting used to it, because after all it is a foreign object that sits in your neck. Unless it is inflamed, infected, etc, you are probably fine. If it is bothering me I take ibuprofen/tylenol but that is rare. Glad to have you here.  It all depends on luck really. There is nothing you can do or not do to prevent a shunt revision. I am 28 and I have had a total of 27 shunt revisions. One was a planned revision and the rest were emergency shunt revisions with two of them putting me in the neuro icu to externalize the shunt to check for an infection. Luckily no infection in either case. Good luck in the future!! I consider myself lucky.  I have had a shunt since around birth and only had to have shunt revisions to add more length as I grew as a kid.  It was not until this February I had to have the entire thing replaced due to a break from calcification over time.  I am 30 now so basically the whole shunt minus the revisions from growing as a kid I got almost 30 years out of my shunt 30 years!?! Hope my shunt lasts at least half as long XD Hello! I also consider myself lucky as I have had the same shunt since 2001. I do not remember a pulling feeling so I hope that goes away for you.", "Update on New Shunt Anyone else recently had a vp shunt replacement too? \nI have a Delta one valve and was Re evaluated this morning that it is working!

I (25M) have arrested hydrocephalus that was successfully treated at 9 months old with a third ventriculostomy (no shunt). I was wondering if anyone in this community has had this or a similar procedure while participating in extreme activities. A few of my friends want to go skydiving and are asking me to join them. I plan to try to get an updated MRI looked at from a neurosurgeon (the person who performed my procedure is long retired.) Just wanted to know if anyone else has participated in skydiving and get safe about it. Thanks! ( came up last year. There is even a user who is a shunted skydiving instructor. I am 30 and have had 30 shunt revisions. Skydiving was always a dream of mine and I decided one day to ask my neurosurgeon and neurologist about going skydiving. They saw no issues with me going and I scheduled my jump. I have gone twice and anytime anyone ask about it, I urge them to go. My ultimate plan is to take a large group and jump with a large group. From the time I walked into the drop zone my first time, through watching the required video, to getting the harness on and getting on the plane, I was comfortable throughout the whole thing. If you have a drop zone near you, I would highly suggest you visit. When you show interest in going skydiving, there are people there that will explain everything to you. The people that are at these drop zones love to see when people are interested and wanting to go skydiving. Thank you for your comments! I was able to check out the post from about 8 months ago, and that was helpful. If anyone had a surgical correction without a shunt I would be interested in hearing from them too. Thanks :)", "Do you ever have days where you are just grateful to be here?  Since I had an emergency ETV done this past Summer which had some complications, yeah.

Born extreme premature in GW 25 @ 698 gram and had her first hydrocephalus related brain surgery weighing in at just above 700 grams. Not even 2 years old and have had 6 brain surgeries so far, *currently* with a working VP shunt.\n\nAll praise to science, the medical devices &amp; pharmacology industry. But perhaps most of all, thanks to all the healthcare proffessionals out there. Love you all. What is the reasoning for an emergency etv instead of a shunt? My understanding is that an etv is a way to subvert the need for a shunt for patients that meet some specific set of qualifications; Obviously I am wrong.  Honestly, I have no idea, especially since I had already had a shunt in place previously. \n\nI apparently met the criterion, and apparently agreed to the procedure, though I do not remember much past the dinner I would had that evening before going to the hospital with what we thought was just a really bad migraine.  The last 4 or 5 days have been so rough for me with this weather we are having. Feeling grateful for that long stretch I had where everything was fine but I feel so shitty right now.  New shunt for someone in my family, how does the weather affect you? We live in a hot, humid place, is that worse or better for shuntees? Sorry for the total noob questions... Honestly, for me, it is not so much one weather type over another (I guess the surgery sites hurt with cold weather but that is pretty much any surgery, I would imagine). \n\nIt is actually the quick and sudden weather or barometric pressure changes that take place in a day or two. For example, it is been cold and rainy the last couple days, through this morning. I wore a beanie and a jacket on the way to work. It is now 70 degrees and sunny. The sudden shift really messes with my equilibrium and I get symptoms of head/ear pressure and tinnitus. I can usually tell if it is going to rain in the next few hours based on how my head/ears feel. \n\nI think your weather situation is fine as long as the shuntee is already well acclimated to that type of weather.  Thank you so much \ud83d\ude03 You are welcome! Hope that helps. Good luck to you and your relative.  Yes!!!

I would checked this page out a few years back and it seemed pretty dead then so I had not thought to look again until now. \n\nA little about me: I am a 24 year old guy who first became symptomatic shortly before my 13th birthday. About a month after I turned 13 I had the first of what would end up being 17 surgeries over a five year period. Life's had it is ups and downs but overall, compared to where I was at, I am doing great thankfully. \n\nThe main reason I am posting here is to get feedback on a silly idea I had. I have been toying around with the idea of making a few videos kind of detailing what my own personal experiences were like, how I am doing today, talking about other people's experiences...I dunno. It seems like people have so many different experiences with hydrocephalus that I am not really sure my thoughts or experiences really amount to much. What my goal is is to kind of give people who are or were in my situation an idea of what to possibly expect from dealing with hydrocephalus, or for those who are doing as poorly as I was when I was at my worst, give them hope that things will get better for them. \n\nDo you guys think there would be any interest or would it be worth my while? On one hand, I feel like maybe something I say could help others maybe? But on the other hand, when I read about other people who have undergone surgery many more times than I did or who are worse off than I am, I feel my opinions are inadequate because I got off relatively lucky with all of this. I would love to hear some honest feedback one way or the other. I think that would be a great idea. I wish we had youtube when I was diagnosed. All I had was comfort of a 1970s medical book to help get through it.  I say go for it!!! I think that this is a phenomenal idea.

In short GP-MRI-SURGERY\n\nThey took away part of the tumour but I was still over compensating with the production of csf so needed a shunt ( fixed low to mid pressure vp shunt).\n\nAfter several months mri scans showed the cyst had filled up into the space where they removed the tumour. As I have a shunt I had not yet felt the impact. If I Do start to feel the pressure etc again, they have advised that I have an ommaya reservoir where they can then manually take out the liquid in the cyst periodically. \n\nI would always follow your doctors advice, you can always get a second opinion. If your quality of life is still pretty good and this is not debilitating keep up with the monitoring. If your symptoms change or increase in anyway tell them. Ok thank you. Btw I forgot to ask, how did your surgery go? Did you have any cognitive impact or memory problems after? I would say I was in a bit of a fog for several months after but I had had a lot of surgeries over 2 monthd due to various complications. \nMemory is definitely worse but then I used to have excellent memory so luckily still ok ish.

My VP shunt might be calcified, I am in pain, and my neurosurgeon does not seem to be worried at all. Any thoughts/stories? Hey everyone! \n\nI am new to /r/hydrocephalus. Have had a VP shunt all 18 years of my life, minus a little more than a week. Had a few scares through the years, but never a true malfunction and never a revision.\n\nI had some bad, scary pain and went to the ER Monday. They took x-rays and a CT scan. CT was normal. ER doctor thought there looked to be a break or a blockage in a bent out part of my neck.\n\nTuesday morning ended up at the local neurosurgeon's office and he said it looked calcified from the x-rays, and thought there might be a break. Did not know if it was old or new. I remembered I was walking and reading about a week before and I tripped and fell, and felt pain in my neck, but I did not think about my shunt then.\n\nThere is a part in my neck that is bent way out and feels abnormal. It is not going THROUGH the skin or really irritating it on the outside, but it looks pretty lumpy. It hurts all around there and if I touch it or bump it, pain shoots up and down my shunt.\n\nNow I am starting to have focusing problems in my classes and in general. I am not going to say how long this took me to write. I have been having random dizzy spells and weird times where my vision can see depth (have pretty bad strabismus and no real constant depth perception). Last night I felt like I was going to be sick and also was sweating like a pig. I did not have a fever, or at least my roommate did not think so, but neither of us have a thermometer. It is been harder to walk back and forth to class balance and strength wise in my legs. I am left handed, my shunt is on the right side, and my right arm feels more numb and way weaker than it should. I feel really out of it and lethargic. Am I imagining it?\n\nAnyways my main questions are:\n\n1. Does anyone else have experience with not having malfunctions or revisions, and might that mean my hydrocephalus might be under control without the shunt, especially because it is calcified?\n\n2. Does anyone have any experience with their shunt calcifying?\n\n3. When I was little, even if I only had a little headache, I would rush off to the ER and get CTs, MRIs, even an ultrasound. It always ended in \"dehydration\", or non shunt related things. Now that there is a case for a shunt malfunction, the neurosurgeon in the town I am in now does not seem concerned. I am a sophomore in college in a medium sized city with one neurosurgeon. Should I calm down, or should I get a second opinion? Is freaking out over possible shunt malfunctions a pediatric thing?\n\nTL;DR: I am scared for once a potential shunt malfunction is what it looks like and needs replaced, but my small town neurosurgeon is either too busy to deal with it or does not think it matters.\n\nSorry about the novel!", "Hydro in pop culture I am parked in front of a tv, watching a marathon of House and they were mentioning CSF at on point and that got me wondering what other media has touched on the subject. No real reason, I am just bored lol. I wonder how many famous people have hydro. My understanding is that hydrocephalus is usually a secondary condition caused by something more glamorous (at least by pop culture standards).  So I doubt hydrocephalus gets much mention. It is the only diagnosed thing that I deal with - albeit as an abnormal version (multiple shunts due to multiple pockets of fluid rather than just one). I get frustrated that discussion of hydrocephalus either stops at childhood cases, or focuses on the untreated cases as a curiosity or like a museum exhibit. I know it is a rare enough condition, but I would just like to be able to find other people with similar experiences...hence why I like this sub. I saw an alien show where they found a big skull and thought it was proof of aliens until they found the shunt tubing and decided the person just had hydrocephalus Hahah my friend was sure it was prof I was an alien \ud83d\udc7d Interesting, I have never heard of that before.  It is the only diagnosed thing I deal with as well at the moment as well but I had a cyst before my diagnosis.  Thanks for sharing! The way my parents told it to me was that it is almost unheard of in North America but is slightly more known in Europe(where my dad is from). I have not found anything online about it, but speaking with someone at the local hydro group, they would heard of it. One of my early shunts is in the front left quarter, whereas the other one and my newest one are in the rear right. Hydrocephalus is mentioned on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, so is normal pressure hydrocephalus. \n\nAs far as famous people.... there is an ex-NFL star who developed hydro after some concussions/brain injuries.\n\nEdit to add: it was also on an episode of \u201cER\u201d Listened to the Pet Semetary audio book and it was the first time I would heard the diagnosis even get mentioned in something that was not a medical text book. Maybe not wholly pop culture-ish but with the resurgence of King-based  movies, I thought it was a neat tie-in I distinctly remember an episode of ER where Dr. Weaver finds a boy on the street and takes him to the ER and feels his shunt track and figures out he must be shunted for hydro. And me as a child did not know what hydro was but found it terrifying and interesting that someone could feel that. I did not know what my future was in for \ud83d\ude43 The UK has a show called super vet and a Chihuahua had it, not much else I have seen though It is featured a couple of times on Holby City (BBC in UK) that I am aware of. Once where a teenage girl was getting her shunt replaced by an ETV (and if I remember correctly the op could not be completed - the NS character is an alcoholic so it was something to do with that or him being cocky). More recently (last year maybe?) there was a story involving shunt malfunction with a young woman. Neither story covered it any detail. I will have to watch that episode because I have had similar experiences, though not as a child on the street \ud83d\ude02 I myself work in the ER, and in a slow moment I was telling one of the nurses and the doctor about my VP shunt and the nurse was like \u201ccan I feel it?!\u201d (referring to the shunt track) and it freaked her out. Made me laugh.\n\nI had obstructive hydrocephalus that was corrected by surgery after the initial shunt placement, so my shunt was left to lapse and my neurosurgeon said it was safe to leave in, so it just chills there and it is a great conversation piece \ud83d\ude02 Meredith grey and Derek shepards adopted daughter Zola was born with it on greys anatomy. Derek operates on her. Yup that is the one!! My mind was blown by her quick recognition. The marathon is still playing, and the episode on right now just mentioned NPH, lol. Had you heard that one of the original shunt designs was for Road Dahl's child who developed hydro after being hit by a car?\n\nI think that is quite cool. He is also my wife's favourite author. I believe Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th movies has hydrocephalus? Not exactly an ideal rolemodel for us, but it is something! Raymond\u2019s Run", "Jiu jitsu Hello I am 17 years old and have had a vp shunt since I was two years old with no problems so far (not even headaches) do any of you know if it would be ok for me to start doing jiu jitsu? Any feedback is greatly appreciated! I was advised by my neurosurgeon to stop tae kwan do, just because of the potential risk of getting kicked in the head during sparring. \n\nI would not recommend it, just because of how high contact jui jitsu tends to be. You can tell people not to hit you in the head, but inevitably, you will take a hit to the head. The likelihood of it getting damaged is pretty high in those circumstances. The danger there is the shunt getting damaged and malfunctioning, causing them to open you back up to change it out. \n\nIt is your life, and you do you booboo, but I would advise against it. Just because of how good you have been doing, you do not want to risk them having to open you back up and then introducing a scenario where you start to have headaches again. Just because you are not having pressure headaches anymore, does not mean another brain surgery will not cause more damage to the dura and create migraines stemming from that. \n\nAsk your surgeon though if you are not sure! But I 100% guarantee they will tell you no lol I have been doing Japanese Jujitsu for 21 years now with a VP shunt. Just be mindful of your shunt and do not do moves that would obviously injure you/the shunt. Make sure you are doctor/NS is aware and discuss the risks and benefits. \n\nBenefit: Helped my balance and coordination tremendously!\nRisk mitigation: There are certain types of throws that I do not let people do to me as they are higher risk throws. I only do Randori\\*/Freestyle grappling with people I know and trust when training. Make sure EVERYONE you work with is aware and at minimum the sensei/senpai needs to be made aware. \n\n\\*If you are planning on doing BJJ I would caution against it due to the heavy Randori component.\n\nMy NS at the time I started said it was not a problem and when I moved to an adult NS, he told me not to do it anymore...by that time I had been doing it for almost 10 years and basically told him that is not happening. This is excellent advice.  Make sure everyone is aware and be aware of your body and surroundings (something you will learn in martial arts).  I had a VP shunt when I trained and earned a black belt in taekwondo (VA shunt now).  Admittedly I trained at a more traditional school where sparring was not the priority. My daughters neurosurgeon actually said the exact opposite regarding the durability of shunts. He said the only the only two shunts he has seen broken were from blows so severe they would have likely resulted in skull fractures. Essentially, the shunts prevented serious injury! No kidding....wellllll that bums me out a little bit lol I could have played football Also, ( is a great read from someone in my system of Jujitsu with Hydrocephalus that earned his 3rd degree blackbelt. I am testing for my 3rd degree probably about 1 year after I can return to the mat (post covid; covid has delayed me quite a bit). I guess it is less likely you have CTE so you do have that going for you. Lol indeed. Silver lining I was advised by my neurosurgeon to stop all contact sports for risk of disconnecting the shunt. I used to be super active.", "2 weeks post surgery, has anyone had nerve pain / numbness following a revision? I really appreciate all of those who take the time to reply to my questions on here, I have never met anyone with a shunt, so it is very cool to hear from so many who have dealt with the same stuff. I had a revision done 2 weeks ago (16 days) and I have been having some odd symptoms, though my neuro team does not seem too concerned. \n\nthe shunt I had prior to this surgery lasted ten years, from age 11 to 21. Supposedly I was living with a blocked shunt for many years, and for some reason all the scans I had in that time looked normal till one day my ventricles finally got big and that is when I had surgery. Immediately after surgery I had no headache, I am guessing since there was so much fluid built up, relieving it relieved my headache. About a week after the surgery I started to get another headache, but it is only about a 2 or 3 out of 10. I am hoping they just need to find the right setting since they put in a programmable valve. \n\nI have been having 2 concerning symptoms, 1. Minor night sweats, and 2. Slight Numbness &amp; tingling in both my feet. Of course these symptoms are symptoms of malfunction / infection, so being the hypochondriac I am, I went to the ER 2 times and I have seen 3 different neurosurgeons at the place I had the revision done. They did some tests and deemed my shunts fine and no infection. I did not have night sweats last night so I am hoping it was either anxiety or a side effect of the anesthetic... but has anyone experienced tingling or numbness in the feet? I am hoping my nerves did not get messed up or anything. All my neurosurgeons and people from the neuro  dept said to see neurology, there is nothing wrong with my shunt. Has anyone felt this way after surgery? Thank you.      So I am 3 weeks post op. My shunt lasted about 16 years. I turned 21 in June and had 3 revisions this year alone and 7 in my life. I think the night sweats you are having are anxiety because you have them then you do not. The numbness could be circulation. It does not sound like you have an infection. \n      I have 12 scars on my stomach 1 on my chest and 2 on my head. One of the ones on my stomach got infected and I am on meds for that. The first surgery was done to try to relieve headaches and some problems I was having. The second one was done after being rushed to the emergency room after a seizure. This last one I was just supposed to see my surgeon and go to work after and ended up being in the hospital a week because I had another emergency surgery because I had symptoms of severe blockage that was shown on a CT scan I had a few days before. \n     There is numbness in the incisions on my head but I understand that nerves we are severed and need to reattach But I am no doctor you should get a follow up Are you taking any medications such as painkillers? It is weird I have head a numb spot on my back (it kind of comes and goes) and I think it is only been in the last few years since surgery but I have never mentioned it to my dr", "Stephen Dolle on his ongoing battle with hydrocephalus.

I had my shunt placed at age 10 and had a revision a few months later. My second shunt lasted for 12 years, and at 22, I started having terrible headaches. My shunt had slipped out of my ventricle. I had surgery 7 months later because the catheter of my third shunt started to come out of the skin on the top of my head. My fourth shunt was placed in a new spot behind my ear (it had always been on the top right side of my head). I am coming up on my third year shunt replacement free. I wish there were more options and ways to manage hydrocephalus. It is really disappointing that there are not other ways besides brain surgery to fix the issue. Hopefully one day there will be. I hope you have many more revisionless years! Thank you.  I hope I will not have to have another one anytime soon.  I just do not know how to explain things to a friend of mine. I also know that we cannot really predict when the shunt messes up.   What are you having trouble explaining?  I tried explaining to my best friend exactly why I was afraid to tell him about my hydro.  Because you do not just tell anyone.  He is in the Army and said he would get leave for my surgery when I have to have one but I do not think he knows how scary it is.  I am in a similar situation. First one at 3 months old. Replaced a couple tubes when I was a kid due to horse play. When I was 14 my tube was calcified and I broke it popping my neck. When I was 18 my skin broke around the pump on right side of he back of my head exposing the shunt. They moved it to the left side of my head above my temple, running down behind my ear. 15 years later I am still on the same tube and shunt.  I have had mine 20 years now. That is awesome  I had my shunt since 4mons for 20yrs to the date before it had to replaced That is awesome  ", "Anyone end up in a coma? When I had my shunt put in I had many complications:\n\n\\- body rejected the shunt\n\n\\- fluid was not draining so I was forced to sleep on an incline bed\n\n\\- blows to the head (car accident and hockey stick)\n\nOn 2-3 occasions I slipped into a coma, going to bed feeling ok and waking up days later in the hospital.   Anyone else go through this? I have when I was a baby", "Hospital stays I am curious to know.\nHow long were you in the hospital after revision surgery?\nDid anything happen during your stay? Anything go wrong?\nWhat did you do during recovery? \nWhat did you take with you? I had two revisions in the past year.  The first was to move me from a VP to a VA shunt (move the tubing from my stomach to a vein in my neck).  I was released the same day, only to come back to stay the night with an intense low pressure migraine because apparently the surgeon was not careful about how much fluid leaked out during the surgery.  The second revision replaced all of the external tubing because the valve had failed (presumably due to age).  After my experience in early 2018 I specifically requested the surgeon take care to maintain a reasonable fluid pressure once I was patched back up.  The hospital (different from where the first one was performed) kept me overnight and i was good to go almost immediately and left the hospital, with no issues, the next day.  Recovery for both surgeries was difficult mostly due to the fact that I am a fairly active person and general anesthesia really takes it out of you for a couple weeks.    My child\u2019s revisions took about 48 hours or so in the hospital. She honestly was happy and playing with her iv shortly after waking up. They kept her for observation since she was all of 12 pounds and a year or so old. I am always surprised how quick the surgeries are and how quick the recovery can be. Most of the surgery is waiting on anesthesia and most of the recovery is anesthesia.  I have had 25 revisions, all VP Shunts, 5 have been in the last 10 years. The last 3 for me have been 24 hour affairs where I was discharged the morning after surgery. I have also had revisions where I have been in the hospital for a month. The longer stays were because of shunt infections and were more than 20 years ago.\n\nI like to write, so I would always bring a notepad to the hospital with me, otherwise, I would pass the time by reading. One of my stays was a week, the other was three days. I do not know how long when I actually had my shunt placed or my first revision when I was 3. I brought my stuffed animal shark and my own blanket. I mostly just listened to music and slept. As far as electronics go. I brought other stuff but did not use any of it like books or video games. My little girl had an ETV/CPC in May '18. She was in hospital for a full week after surgery. Things looked really promising. However, it failed. So she had a revision in December '18. She was in the hospital for 4 days for that surgery.  My revisions usually take about 12 hours. My stay usually lasts four to five days from admission to release time. The things I bring with me are usually a suitcase, books, a stuffed animal and anything essential. My parents are at all my surgeries and my brother checks in when he can. I hope that helped. If you have any questions,  I am here  That sounds like it hurt \ud83d\ude14 My boyfriend is scared I will not remember him after the surgery I hope I am not there long I just adopted a kitty on Saturday\nI live to read and write too. Books are already in my hospital bag I think maybe I will just take a blanket. My boyfriend wants to take all my video games and my laptop and all my chargers. But I am like what books am I going to take? I got this shunt placed when I was 5 but now it is clogged and shattered and hurts allot Thank you . My dad and momma are coming from my home town and my brothers too  because I moved to Houston when I turned 18. I use backpacks for everything lol. Thank you . My dad and momma are coming from my home town and my brothers too  because I moved to Houston when I turned 18. I use backpacks for everything lol. So they are going to do surgery, replace the line, reconnect it where it needs, and adjust how much tubbing is in your head? \nThat sounds painful!! Yes he wants to change to valve in my head and try to get as much tubbing out as possible because it is calcifying and sticking to my body by forming scar tissue in my chest and neck Fortunately the surgery does not interact with that area of the brain. I asked our neurologist similar questions about the effects of the surgery and how they would pertain to memory and the like and the  truth is that the surgery has essentially no effect on the patients cognitive ability. Damage to the brain occurs if the hydrocephalus is not treated and cranial pressure remains high for an extended period of time. I have never read of any cases of amnesia brought on after a shunt surgery or revision.  That is what I told him. My surgeon said that this surgery may cause more brain damage when he does the revision My experience for what it is worth comes from my daughter who was born very prematurely. I am not sure how that effects later surgeries. I do not know your case nor am I a medical professional in any capacity. My daughters surgeries have all been fairly fast and honestly seemed routine for the surgeons. ", "Will my fog ever go away? Hello Hydrocephalus Reddit,\n\nSo I found out about my hydrocephalus after blacking out from binge drinking. I only say this because I had little to no symptoms up until this point.\n\nThe cause of my hydrocephalus was a brain tumor, which they removed. I did not need a shunt at this point.\n\nAbout two months later, I had a really strange headache and went to the ER. They sent me home and said everything was normal, and not to come back unless my pain was so bad that I could not function. \n\nWell that day came in about a week. At this point, I went back to the ER and I received a shunt.\n\nI woke up from that surgery feeling almost no pain, but with a mental fog that would not go away. \n\nSo now, it is 6 months later, and that fog never quite went away. \n\nI am a college student with a 3.76 GPA. Last semester, even with that mental fog, I maintained that GPA. But now I realized I have to at least try to get past that if I want to get the most out of grad school.\n\nAnyways, I ended up deciding to stay a fifth year in college in order to give myself time to prepare. \n\nDoes anyone have tips to beat this feeling? Or at least work around it? Is the mental fog a confusion or something else? I have only ever had confusion before a shunt surgery so I may need clarification.   It is a confusion and a lack of being able to understand my surroundings. And a lack of short term memory It sounds like a possible malfunction symptom but every case is different.  It might be scarring on the brain that is causing the  short term memory loss. That sounds alarming. I never considered that possibility though.  I have had hydrocephalus since I was born (not congenital my mom is very petite and my head got lodged in her birth canal causing a subdural hematoma) in the past 5 years I have had 18 brain surgeries including 2 brain infections and 3 abdominal infections. After my brain infection I was a completely different person. I felt like all the happiness had been sucked out of me. I did a lot of research regarding hydrocephalus and for me antidepressants helped but at the time I was suffering from ptsd. My cognitive abilities have returned but it takes a lot of rest and unfortunately time for the brain to heal. My best advice moving forward is to do your own research and remember the doctors and surgeons may have the degrees and expertise for surgery but you are the expert on your body. I was told I was fine for 7 years while my shunt was malfunctioning even Ben Carson (who was my original neurosurgeon) said I was fine and was probably making up the pain for attention. Advocate for yourself and do not be afraid to stand up to the doctors. I wish you all the best  Jesus. Ben Carson. I will take everything you have said to heart. I am going to just take my time to let my brain heal and hope that with practice I can start to do better at basic mental skills. It took me a good year before I could mentally handle college classes. In the mean time, I would try to break up your studying in to small sections and try to figure out the easiest study method for you which it sound like you have done well with your gpa thus far. After my 4th surgery, I try to go back to school and could not remember anything. I would just try to give yourself some time and make sure you talk to your professors. My professors were very accommodating and understanding.\n\nI forgot to mention how disoriented I can become. This has honestly happened forever but is much worse post surgery.  Hey, jumping on this post quite late. After 20 years of hydro exp. (brain tumor too), and 2x longer in university than I should have due to shunt malfunctions, my advice is that it *can* go away.\n\nOf course not a doctor, so disclaimer: seek medical advice.\n\nSometimes, it just takes the body a bit to fully recoup from surg, yes longer than the 6-8 weeks to really fully be back in balance. My argument is when the CSF levels are rebalanced, your brain can become more clear. Post-tumor is still healing from trauma. I went super into diet, sleep cycles, light regular activity (rather than intense activity that wears you out/down), and maybe it helps 10%. But it is really the CSF balance by shunt/neuro. When I have had an imbalance that is not treated for 6 months, I am foggy and struggle in school and everything goes out of whack. When it is at a good pressure, I have clarity. \n\nI had a 3.7 also with a good wave of health first years of university; then 3.1 when I just pulled through. But it is not a straight decline; A's again in good health - so my grades follow the levels of CSF literally. That is great that you are taking the extra year; I needed 4. Still looking at grad school too. \n\nJust know it is possible to rebalance, but there will inevitably be changes from your former self. The fog is not necessarily a stasis though. You are going to have to do mega self-care to not stress your body, and try keeping a regular rhythm of wake/sleep, meal times, find out if certain time of day gives a bit more clarity, and that pushing through will not always give you the best results -- rest is *often* the best medicine. Wow dude you came at the right time. \n\nI ended up medically withdrawing from last semester because I missed too much work but since then have recovered a lot.\n\nI think the key is to rest a lot. I was pushing myself wayyyyy to hard and too far and I just cannot do that anymore.\n\nI am actually doing an independent project right now with a professor I love and am learning to work at the right place and eat right and all that jazz.\n\nI am also on an anti depressant now so that also helps Good to hear! That it is helpful; not that you had to withdraw. It is a bummer, but not irreconcilable (i.e. that is life, but that sounds insensitive). Yup, pushing through is imbued in our culture, but it is a fallacy. Slow &amp; steady. You seemed to learn the lesson quicker than I did -- I have 13 withdrawals (medical) on my transcript (stubborn af...).\n\nThat is great, I did an independent study too for prof research, and it is honestly a better experience than class (and a plus for grad school!). Does your prof know the situation, or just happened upon the opportunity? My professor knows everything. She actually visited me in the hospital when I had my tumor removed.\n\nWorking with her so far is a blast. She has given me a lot of structure but also room to explore and figure out things on my own (it is a philosophy and literature project, by the way).\n\nAnd deciding to withdraw was honestly a positive thing for me. Staying in that semester would have been the real bummer. I am learning to ride the waves, if you will. Take advantage of the good days, nap on the bad ones.\n\nAlso noticed that it is harder for me to wake up in the summer and I am guessing it is hydrocephalus . I live in a place that gets about 80 degrees and very humid in the summer. Does that happen to you?\n\nFor the record, I have talked to my doctor about all of these symptoms. Sounds like you have found a pretty awesome backup plan, and to have her on board &amp; visiting in host is actually amazing. That major combo seems pretty flexible to follow your interests? Did your health experience shift your research focus at all?\n\nYup, good days, bad days. Roll with the sucker punches. :)\n\nHeat is the bane of my existence! Although other hydro people say they are fine with it. I just completely wilt and get a gnarly headache -- big cause of school delayed, cannot do campus in the heat, brain does not work. Like to the point where I realize it is not safe to drive  and I have forgotten my phone passcode. I am going to Scotland this summer to escape the heatwave! \n\nOthers say weather/storms/barometric pressure affect them. This is not just a hydro phenomenon though, migrainers, general headache-ers, and other pain is often complained about with barometric shifts.\n\nIf you are interested in the nerdy/research theory side, I can go into vasodilation and components of brain pressure, in relation to heat/activity (research level: basic). Helps me validate my experience I suppose.\n  **Not to minimize hydro extra sensitivity to barometric pressure change** So funny story actually, before my experience I actually studied the philosophy of death and dying, then I got diagnosed with a low grade cancer and needed radiation while simultaneously being diagnosed with hydro. So not a huge shift in my research after the fact. Still on mortality.\n\nI actually am doing part of my research on post colonialism but seem to be looking into paths on spirituality from a global perspective. This is surprising for me because I am pretty atheistic, but this experience really made me think about what it means to have a mind and what the mind needs to produce experience. Maybe that is inspired by the fact that my brain looks nothing like I expected. And so this thing that I thought was my mind does not actually look anything like I think it should. In spite of this, my conscious experience seems normal...\n\nYes I love nerds. Explain to me all of the brain things.", "Concern About Another Revision My girlfriend just had a shunt revision on Valentine's day (she is usually the one that posts on here). Post surgery she was doing great and she had minimal pain. Everything was good until about a week ago. She started feeling really nauseous and was constantly vomiting. And tonight while at home she had a seizure or passed out or something along those lines. So we rush her to the ER.\n\nThis ER is at a different hospital then where her neurosurgeon is, but it is the closest hospital to us. Now after the neurosurgeon at this hospital looked at her scans he says he believes the shunt is failing and she will need surgery again. My concern is if she really needs another surgery or is it something that can just be made by better by changing the pressure in her shunt. Plus this hospital and neurosurgeon is not her normal neurosurgeon and I am just not sure what to think or what we should do. There seems to be something else going on, In my experience, I have never heard of a variable pressure shunt causing a seizure. Please take her to her normal neurosurgeon as soon as possible. He would be the one to determine if it actually is the shunt causing the issues.   Usually she should find relief in certain positions if it is the shunt. Shunts can get blocked any time unfortunately:-( best of luck! OP here (was finally able to charge my phone), turns out the end of the shunt is coiled up in her stomach, they strongly believe that is what is been causing her to feel really bad over the last week. I know her original surgeon did tell us it was coiled be he did not believe it would be an issue. Anyway, they did a shunt tap and she seemed to feel much better after getting some of the csf out. So she decided to have her surgery here tomorrow, since we are not sure when we might be able to get ahold of her other surgeon. The fact that her symptoms subsided after the shunt tap tells me that her shunt is probably malfunctioning in 1 of 2 ways; either the valve is malfunctioning, or she has an abdominal pseudocyst, which is basically a blockage at the end of the shunt that drains into her abdomen. I suppose there could also be a kink in the tubing in her abdomen that is backing the shunt up, but a kink would be a surgical error that a competent neurosurgeon should not make. I have spoken to her several times here on Reddit about her shunt, so please let me know how things go, and tell her BrainPains says hi!", "What is it like being a Neuro Nurse? I am a psych grad and have been a mental health aide for over two years working in memory care,  group homes and for adults with developmental disabilities. \nI,  alone, have had hydrocephalus since birth that made me have multiple brain surgeries in order to survive(VP shunts). I am a brain surgery activist here in Houston and am taking nursing prerequisites. \n\nWhat is it like being a neuro ICU nurse?  Becoming a neuro nurse is my dream job because I love helping ppl like me with my condition. \n\nAny uplifting information is great! Just wanted to say that my hydro warrior and I are in the Houston area, a lot of pedi/nicu nurses at memorial Hermann were really quite awesome. Nice to meet another hydro warrior in the area Hey nice to meet you!  Do you attend any of the Hydrocephalus meetings?  (At least before the pandemic?) My daughter is 15 mos so we are still fairly new to the hydro world, I did the online conference a couple weeks ago though Ok me too and I have had hydro since birth and am here if you have any questions! Absolutely! Thank you", "New research for Shunt Obstruction  Here is the link for more information or to join the ( Thanks!  I have always wondered if anyone was looking into this! Ikr Blockages are what cause so many shunt revisions. I hope some good comes out of this. I had plenty, I think 8 shunt failures and most were blockages before they decided to try ETV. Would also like to see her thoughts as a fellow chemical engineer also. Really cool perspective. So is your ETV working well for you? My son has had quite a few revisions for several reasons but was not a candidate for the ETV. He currently has a working VP shunt and an inactive LP shunt. He has had about 19 neuro related surgeries so far plus all kinds of other surgeries. \n\nIt would be great if you could talk to her about Chemical Engineering. Maybe you will be able too. 2 years in, still going strong.  So I guess we will see.  Hoping your son is doing well now.\n\nI would very much like to.  I am in a very separate niche field now in chemical engineering, but always love to learn what others are researching. My son is doing good health wise right now. Thanks!\n\nI hope you checked out the website. In the pics above, you can see other upcoming webinars and past webinars. The HA has been very helpful in research and support for the Hydrocephalus community. Sounds great! I had not previously joined as I am in Canada and the site seemed US focussed but will follow along for these things. Glad to hear your son is doing better!", "Do you think I have it? My symptoms started a few years ago. Constant head pressure, feeling unnatural when walking, stiff neck, and fatigue. Is it possible to have just a mild case? I think I may need to see a doctor. I remember a couple years ago walking down the street and all of my symptoms temporarily remitted for about 45 seconds when they quickly returned just as before. This caused me to consider a physical diagnosis rather than a mental one. I do not really suffer from anxiety or depression, so I do not think that is the cause. I think that I may have hydrocephalus.", "Weird question about nausea Hi everyone, I have had a weird experience with nausea ever since I can remember and have just been informed that its not something people without shunts experience (who knows maybe it really is just a me thing). I have not been able to find anything online so I thought I would ask here.\n\nWhenever I am over draining (Programmable VP shunt) I get nauseous. When I lay down the nausea subsides. The problem is I only feel the sensation in my head? \n\nI feel like I am going to throw up but my stomach feels fine, and most of the time I never even throw up. It is always been there when I have felt nauseous in the past so I am having a hard time describing this symptom in a way other than nausea.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this?", "Anybody else have this problem? Or is it just me? I get (late) up for the day.\nMy shunt starts over draining because I am standing/sitting upright.\nI get a bad headache.\nI lay down and take a nap to counter that. \nThen I end up only getting to sleep at 2 or 3 am.\nAnd I get up late the next morning... Yes, very much so. Caffeine helps with the overdraining for me though! Talk to your neuro surgeon. Do not programable shunts stop over draining? Thanks for the tip. I will try that. At this point I am willing to try almost anything I did, at my last appointment with him in January. He seemed to be focused on if the shunt was sitting properly or not, and nothing else. I think I might have to look for a second opinion. Although I am not sure if mine is programmable I have a very similar problem which, after some time, has gotten better. I am glad it is gotten better for you. How did you cope through it? Did you take anything for the headache? To be honest, it just went away after some time. No over the counter medication has ever helped for more than 30 minutes if at all. Alrighty, I see. I appreciate the insight though, thank you. I guess I need to be patient and hope for the best. And it is the same with me and OTC meds. They only work for so long. And all they do is make me sleepy. They do not combat the headache", "Baby wipes instead of bathing Hi peeps, I decided to go through with the surgery I am just gathering the necessary \"equipment\" ie duffel bag activities and aftercare items. My question (for now, odds are I will have more questions later on) is are baby wipes a viable option for \"bathing\" as I wont be able to actually shower for a while after surgery. Thanks everyone! So I just had 2 surgeries back to back last month. And I thought the same thing too but you will be able to shower 2 days after your surgery just be gentle. My surgeon told me only to use baby soap for a while I had Staples for one and glue for the other be careful with the glue it falls off by it is self Yeah. They are an option, but you usually do not have to wait that long after the surgery to shower, at least in my experience. I was told Johnson and Johnson. Baby shampoo. Used it daily right after surgery I love cleaning up twice a day, makes me feel better especially when I am in the hospital or sick. \n\nWhy shower? put on some tunes and have bath.  Baby wipes suck and are terrible for the environment.  \n\nAnd you will not be \u201cdirty\u201d since going surgery to a hospital bed or home does not require rolling in mud.  You can have a bath to wash your business end and presto, your clean.  I have been in a coma and woke up several days later in the hospital with a catheter... I felt dirty but quickly gave up wanting to be clean after realizing I was lucky to be alive.  \n\nHope this helps. last time i was in for a revision (2003) one of my ward-mates was in dire need of a shower and the nurses brought him some kind of wipe/cloth that had soap in it but dried with no residue and there were also 'dry' shower caps for washing your hair.  might be worth asking about. From what I understand, I will have an incision in my stomach as well as my head. I do not have insurance so I would like to avoid any unnecessary infections. lol suppose I could get some waterproof medical tape? You could get an infection if you are in contact with the incision area.  \n\nJust do not expose yourself to any physical activities and do not touch the incision areas with unwashed hands.  Look up wound care, and you will notice the process is pretty standard.  \n\nI am in Canada, I do not understand why America does not have a better medical system. Honestly same... our President doesnt help", "Anyone has a family member age 50 or older survive hydrocephalus Anyone has a family member age 50 or older survive hydrocephalus?\n\nMy mom is currently in the hospital since memorial day.  She is very weak right now.  We have transferred her due to the other hospital misdiagnosed her since memorial day. \n\nI am just looking for a little hope someone is family survived hydrocephalus and that she gets better soon.  \n\nMy apology for posting under the wrong section.  I was not sure where to post this under.  \n\nThank you.  Hi there,\nI hope your mom will be okay and is properly getting treated now. My dad is 64 years old, has hydrocephalus and had his shunt surgery back in February of this year. I feel like with older patients such as our parents, the recovery process is what takes the longest. It took my dad some time to get back to his normal self (he also has a brain tumor and is not 100% yet but definitely better than before). After doing research when I found out about my dad's situation, I learned that hydrocephalus is very common and so is the shunt surgery. Have the doctors said what the next steps are for your mom? There is hope. It is hard to believe that when we see our parents very weak but know that there is hope and they will get back to their normal self if they are properly diagnosed. Hang in there. \u2764\ufe0f They figured out the solution for now. Its 50/50 chance for adults.\n\nI was just hoping somone post a story that someone can survive hydrocephalus at an older age instead if a child age. \n\nThank you so much! Im educating myself the disease I do not know much about. Your post made me cry because she acts like she is 80 with dementia she is only 54.\n\nLast week the doctor drill a hole into her skull to release the fluids. They said something is probably with her kidney. We were able to transfer her to a different hospital because we did not feel confident with the hospital since they only have 1 MRI, and they did not give her oxygen tube (?) To help her breathe.\n\nThe new hospital is slowly releasing the fluid and trying to locate where the infection (?)is targeting where exactly it is not in her blood yet. Possible tumor in her brain or not. We feel confident with the new hospital that they will discover something.\n\nMy dad and I decide how she does 2 weeks from now. I just hope we dont have to decide the fate on my mom just yet. My dad was the same! It was like he had dementia as well. Some of the symptoms my dad had that were related to hydrocephalus were memory loss (especially short term - it was to the point where he forgot he ate something an hour ago and thought he needed to eat again), balance issues (he could not walk standing upright, it was like he was going to fall with every step he took), and he could not make it to the washroom on time.\n\nI hope the new hospital you are at now will figure things out for your mom. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk! \ud83e\udd17 I definitely will for guidance!\n\nAgain ty Hydrocephalus how we refer to it is a pretty big umbrella that goes over a lot of different situations. I was really scared of it when my then, very tiny daughter, was diagnosed. In its most basic sense it is a pressure and fluid issue. Fortunately the medical community has figured out a variety of ways to manage pressure. The system in which the spinal fluid moves through our brains and around our brains and spinal cord have multiple places that can essentially develop blockages for a variety of reasons. That is where most people\u2019s cases vary. It is hard to comment on other people\u2019s situations from a keyboard, but I do wish you the best. My knowledge on cases is much more centered around little kids. In their case mortality is pretty much the same as non affected individuals. My daughter was only a few pounds when she got her shunt, and was in a rough spot in the NICU. The improvement post shunt was dramatic. Intracranial pressure messes with a lot of functions. Ty so much for posting this. I never heard of this brain function name before, only dementia/Alzheimer's.  I am trying to educate myself as much as possible to see what I can do to help her.\n\nI just needed a little cheer up hope that this hydrocephalus can be recovered just so I can feel positive that my mom is going to be ok. \n\nAgain ty for posting helping me get through Hydrocephalus is not an actual disease. It is a condition. ( has some great info too. Well organized and written informatively without getting too heavy on medical jargon. If you are stuck sitting in a hospital do not forget to get out and move around. Sometimes just a walk a walk can help you manage the stress even if it is just for as long as you are walking. Again ty and bless you Is definitely higher than a 50/50 chance for an adult. Much higher. What is their solution? &gt; balance issues (he could not walk standing upright, it was like he was going to fall with every step he took), and he could not make it to the washroom on time.\n\nThis is exactly my mom(61). How much improvement did your dad see? My mom is like a cripple at the moment when walking.\n Shes going in tomorrow morning to drain through the spine and see if there is improvement. If there is they will do the shunt on Friday. I saw a huge improvement in my dad. He does not have balance issues and does not have anymore accidents when going to the washroom. The shunt definitely worked for my dad. I hope everything will work out for your mom!", "Might this be Hydrocephalus? (MRI Results, Symptoms) Hi everybody, \n\nA few months ago, I (25F) had an MRI done on my head. \n\nThe MRI results stated that my cerebellar vermis is hypoplastic, and that there is **relative prominence of fourth ventricle**. The fourth ventricle prominence made me think for a moment, considering that this language, to my basic knowledge, indiciates hydrocephalus might be present, or that maybe this should be looked into further.  \n\nDue to this, I spoke to my neurologist, who told me there is nothing to worry about. It made me  skeptical considering the symptoms I have been dealing with are in alignment with hydrocephalus, and have been increasing in severity. \n\n\\----------\n\nApparently these are the common symptoms, and I am experiencing all of them now, having to adjust my employment, education and social life due to them: \n\n\\- Headaches: especially after work or after participating in conversation. Bright lights, movement, and sounds are uncomfortable. Conversations, the sound of people talking, can sound like nails on a chalkboard sometimes. \n\nDifficulty Initation Movements: Yes, sometimes I command myself to move, and it is like my whole body is falling behind, almost freezing up. I think my manager at work is aware of this. \n\nChanges is vision: My focus goes in and out, like a camera, from blur to focus, constantly. \n\n\\- Breathing issues\n\n\\-Difficulty focusing: I cannot even express how hard it is getting, day by day to focus on small tasks. \n\n\\-Unsteady walk: Vertigo and losing my balance is becoming a constant. Some days better than others. \n\n\\-Irrritability: Very on-edge on a daily basis, over the smallest things. This is not in my character, but so many things bug me, simply for being in my presence. \n\n\\- Drowsiness: It is a constant. I do not drink alcohol, and drink about 2 coffees/day to keep me awake. \n\n\\-Changes in personality and behavior: the most prominent aspect. I am angry, depressed and have difficulty focusing on my thoughts. \n\nBladder Control Problems: Yes I go to the bathroom all the time, even if it is just a little urine. \n\n\\- Think I am developing dystonia on my face, along with constant cramps in hands and feet. \n\n\\-----------\n\nWhat are your thoughts on all of this?\n\nShould I investigate the fourth ventricle situation further, with a different neurologist?\n\nPlease let me know. I have a new line of occupation soon and I want this to go away so much. \n\nYour time is really appreciated. The headaches and balance issues were something I experienced and were a determining factor in my neurosurgeon wanting to operate. I would schedule an appointment with the surgeon and get his opinion. Mine continued to investigate my issues because I had symptoms, and ultimately a lumbar puncture was the determining factor for operating. Hey, thank you for sharing this. So I do not have a neurosurgeon, but a neurologist. Should I consult a neurosurgeon? Also, did you have an enlarged fourth ventricle as well? I think I had an enlarged fourth and tiny third, which indicated a lack of flow of CSF Thank you!\n\nThat is helpful to know Please explore that further with a different neurologist and even neurosurgeon if possible. Your list of symptoms are definitely a cause for concern - I experienced a majority of them before my diagnosis and treatment too. Best of luck! Thank you so much for your comment Hey Bright-Intern-5997: Would you be able to share your story and recovery via chat with me? I would really like to hear about what you experienced in some more detail and how you went about treatment. No pressure though Of course - not a problem at all!", "Cats can get hydrocephalus too! (She had surgery and it is under control now so she is a happy kitty!)  Aww.....and you are right. Cats can and are born with Hydrocephalus. I have seen 2-3 photos of cats who have hydrocephalus....poor babies! \n\nI was shunted at 30 yrs old. My ventricles were huge and I suffered from headaches and other issues basically from birth, but my head circumference was not off.....etc. My head was only 1 cm different than the average female head....so the doctors had no clue until technology came in the form of the CT Scan. I have headaches, Nystagmus (rapid movement of the eyes) and I vomit quite a bit as well. I was shunted at 5 months! I am sorry to hear you still have symptoms. As far as I know, mine was caused by obstruction and was relieved by surgery after the shunt drained most of it. Still have my shunt though! Now it is mostly something to freak people out, it does not work.\n\nMy head was huge as a baby though, so my parents knew something was up... Thanks. When I was born, I looked like any other baby. By the time the surgery was done (I was 30 yrs old) the doctor said he was not sure what symptoms he would be able to get rid of or lessen for me. I have headaches daily.  It is difficult sometimes, but I try to just push through it and go on with my life.\n\nYou seem to be doing okay and that is great. Many hydro babies do very well and I think that is wonderful. My parents were really upset when I was diagnosed simply because they felt they did not do all they could, and that was not true. They took me to every single doctor that was mentioned or they were referred to and all the doctors said they did not really know what was wrong, but to just let me do whatever I thought I could do. IF I could not do something, I would not. When I was 5 one doctor though I might have a slight case of CP....but he was not sure, and my folks just allowed me to do whatever I could do, etc. I have balance  issues and I am also scared of heights, but I think that is a pretty common thing really.\n\nTake care....and if you ever want to chat, just feel free to msg me! Yeah, my head was big and I had sundowning of the eyes like the kitten in the photo. Yours must have come on slowly, because it sounds like your parents were thorough. Mine was very likely congenital. I am actually missing my entire right temporal lobe and turned out pretty normal!\n\nI hope you find some form of relief for the headaches, I wish I could offer some advice but I do not really have any neurological issues anymore. :(\n\nAnd thank you, I will be sure to do so. I do not know many other people with my condition, even if mine is technically in remission... Hey, hi! You and I are similar, I was also born with hydrocephalus,  but not shunted until I was 30. Head was only a bit bigger than normal. (Not sure of the actual measurement)\nWas not diagnosed until I went to the ER for headaches that were too much to bear (shows what I knew, they are still my normal).\n\nAlso, there is a Facebook page,  that I have followed for years. They try to help hydrocephalic kitties! There are multiple causes of hydrocephalus so it is hard to know exactly what caused your obstruction from context. That being said you mention the surgery drained most of the fluid and that you still have a shunt. That fluid is cerebrospinal fluid, frequently referred to as CSF. We constantly make CSF. It is integral to brain function. We actually make about 500ml of CSF a day. Your excess may have been drained in surgery, but we are continually making it. The shunt itself actually serves to regulate the amount of CSF in the ventricles. Sorry, I meant drained the excess fluid. The shunt no longer functions. \n\nI am not 100% sure what caused the obstruction. I think it was entrapment of the temporal horn, iirc.\n\nSorry for not clarifying! I got side tracked looking that up. Every time I research I keep finding new information. Somewhat ironically I posted in the first place just to share info.", "Shunt I have had a shunt my entire life. Yes, it has not always been a good time but without one I would not be here. I think I can make a better one. Does anyone know where I can get one? I know that sounds weird but I am being serious.  Wait, you want to design a better shunt?  I would like to try.  Well shit, go for it. Not sure how that would work, but if you go through with it, that would be HUGE for all of us. I often daydream thinking of how to make shunts better, or make them last longer. Just little ideas here and there. I wish you the best of luck tho. Not sure if this is any help, but my dad is a physician, Mom is an NP, and I am on track to getting into PA school this year. Let me know if there are any questions you would like me to relay.  Assume you have a shunt? I am pretty sure I can make a longer lasting one. I just need to get my hands on one so I can find out...\nIf you do have a shunt and have had to have revisions can you tell me why? \n\n In my experience, my VP shunt malfunctioned because my pump stopped working or the tubing that connected to it had broken.   yea, know I can make it so it would not clog.", "23 weeks pregnant and scared. Hey everyone, new here. I am 23 weeks pregnant and my baby was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus and an under developed cerebellum. I have a daughter who is about to be 2 and this is all so scary for me. They say that the cerebellum could appear under developed because of the spinal fluid on the brain creating pressure. That maybe once the baby is born they will put a shunt in and see if that helps the cerebellum go back to normal size. But there is still a 50% chance that it will end up in my taking my baby boy home for at home comfort care. Looking up and researching at home comfort care for a newborn has to be one of the hardest things I have ever done. 50/50 chance everything will be okay. I really cant decide if that is good or not... all just so much and having to see a fetal specialist every two weeks and still come home and raise my 2 year old has been a lot and this has all only been going on for 3 weeks. I was directed by a friend to seek out groups on Reddit and Facebook to try and find similar stories to mine to feel less alone. Thank you all for taking your time to read my story and any advice is helpful to me! Thank you! I have typed out my story years ago, and I will copy and paste it in another comment. It is similar to yours. Please do not give up hope. My daughter is now a completely healthy, unbelievably smart, and very compassionate kindergartener. She had some delays with her motor skills early on, but is now at the same level as her classmates. \n\nI worried myself very sick, and now it is just a distant memory. \n\nPlease reach out to me if you need to talk. *this is my original post almost 5 years ago\n\n\n6 months out , I want to share the story of my daughters medical diagnosis during my pregnancy (possible triggers) happy ending\n\nHi everyone! I was a huge lurker in the subreddit during my pregnancy and I still love to read everyone is posts. \nI have recently written all of this out. Ive struggled with deciding if it is something that I am going to share publicly (Facebook, etc.) for months now, it is by no means a secret, but I worry about people treating my daughter differently once is widely known.\nI guess I just needed to share it somewhere. As wonderful as things are now, it felt amazing to put it all on paper. I am hoping that it can provide hope to someone who is facing a terrifying diagnosis of their unborn child. \nForgive me for any typos/errors, I was pretty emotional as I wrote it out. I would love to hear your opinions on if you would want everyone you know to know about it. \n\n\n\nEarly in my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with a low-lying placenta. At the time, the thought of having to have a caesarian section was pretty sad for me, but I just hoped that when I had a follow up at 30 weeks it would be up where it should be. In 99% of women it corrects itself, so I was pretty sure I would be fine. \n\nThe day of my follow-up ultrasound, I was so nervous. I really wanted to give birth naturally, I had imagined it that way for years. My husband  was with me, as always, and he held my hand as the technician started the ultrasound. Pretty much right away, she told me my placenta was exactly where it should be, I breathed a sigh of relief, my biggest worry had gone away. As per usual, the tech let us know that the doctor would check to ensure he had all the photos he needed and then she would let us know that we were free to go. It took her awhile to come back and when she did, she let us know that she needed a few more pictures of the baby's head. I was a bit concerned, but brushed it off thinking since that was not the main focus of the day, she just had not taken enough photos. After a quick couple minutes she finished up and we went to the consultation room to wait for the doctor. We waited and waited. It is all pretty foggy at this point, but after about a half hour, I remember looking at My husband and saying that something must be wrong with the baby's brain. After 45 minutes a doctor finally came in, at this point I was shaking and expecting the worst, the worst was exactly what we got. He explained to us that at some point our daughter had had a stroke, it had caused part of her brain to liquify, she had something called porencphally. He gave us a list of problems that this could cause. Maybe she would be paralyzed or have an inability to eat on her own or worst of all, maybe she would not be able to breathe on her own. He let us know that I would need to have a c-section after all since the baby would need immediate medical attention and that we would be meeting with many specialists within the coming weeks, I had to have an MRI done on my baby belly within days to get a better look at our daughters brain . I do not really remember leaving that day, just that we had to be taken out the back so that the other pregnant women would not see how hysterical I was. We went home that day and cried. I cried for days. My husband was amazing, but I cannot imagine how hard it must have been knowing something was wrong with your baby and seeing your wife unable to find even a second of joy. I was terrified, I could not even get my mind to imagine her being born, were we even going to make it that far, I started to doubt it. I had done everything by the book, eating perfectly and caring for my body, why was this happening to us, we tried so hard for so long to have this baby, I guess I assumed everything would be perfect. \nAfter taking some time off to let myself be sad, I went back to work, hoping to occupy my mind for a little bit. Part way through the day, I started having contractions. I panicked, what if I was in labour already? I could not just have this baby, I needed a c-section and special doctors! I called My husband at work and he picked me up and rushed me to labour and delivery. I was a mess, crying and unable to breathe. They were able to tell us right away that the baby was not coming out that day. They set us up with a bed and listened to me explain what we had just found out about Her. Since my pregnancy had been upgraded to high risk, they called for an obstetrician to come see us. When she came in she asked if we had received the results from our MRI. We were not even scheduled to meet with the doctor yet to learn more about what was happening, but the obstetrician had access to the results right now. I was nervous, We had not had time to mentally prepare ourselves for the results that day and now we were going to hear them. She looked it over and gave us the news...  Our baby did not have porencphally, she had something called hydrocephalus. The part of her brain that looked like liquid on the ultrasound was actually one of her ventricles filled with fluid. It was taking up a lot of space in her head, but there was a chance that her surrounding brain was intact! The list of complications was still long, but this was a much better diagnosis. It was the first time I had been able to muster a smile in days. \n\n In the coming weeks we met with neonatologists, a new, high risk obstetrician and a brain surgeon from the children's hospital. Things were still pretty uncertain, you do not really know how a baby's brain will be affected until the child is born and starts to develop, but there was the option of surgery, which was not there with the initial diagnosis. The only thing we could do was have ultrasounds done every couple weeks to monitor the size of the affected ventricle. If her head became to large, we would need a c-section to birth her safely for both of us. We had 4 ultrasounds and every time, the area stayed the same size. So far things were not getting any worse! \nWe had a lot more information at this point and we were able to relax a little and actually look forward to the birth of our baby girl. \n\nOur doctor decided it would be best to induce me early. That way we would have more control over everything and we could have the proper doctors from the nicu there in case she needed immediate attention. \nOn December 3rd, we went to the hospital to have our baby girl. Labour was amazing, I would go as far as to say I had fun. 15 hours later on December 4th, Our daughter came into our world. Instead of being whisked away by doctors like I had assumed, 2 things happened that I had barely let myself dream would be possible, My husband got to cut the cord and I was able to hold our baby before she had to be taken to the nicu. She was ok!!! It was the most amazing moment of my life. \n\nShe spent her first week in the Children's hospital nicu under observation and having tons of tests done. Things were so much better than I had dreamed. The nurses even told us that if they had not known about her condition, they would have no idea that anything was wrong. \n\nShe is over 6 months now and she is doing so great. She sees her paediatrician every month, she sees her neurosurgeon later this month and gets her 4th MRI in a couple of months. She is had genetic testing which determined that her condition is not genetic. She is had 2 full hearing tests and she can hear perfectly! We measure her head circumstance monthly and call them in to her neurosurgeon. \nWe actually do not know what caused this to happen. We know that she had a brain bleed at some point between 18 and 30 weeks and it caused scar tissue that blocked the ventricle from draining properly.  \nThere can still be complications and if her head ends up under pressure she could still need surgery. As for now she is behaving as a baby without this condition would. She is meeting all of her milestones and does not seem to have any headaches, in fact she is the happiest baby I have ever seen! Facebook has excellent support groups. My son has hydro and a cerebellum defect and a shunt. The drs were wrong about ALOT. You will also see similar stories on those pages. Babies brains are very resilient and after the shunt is in his prognosis will be more clear. Hang in there mama \ud83d\udc93 Do you have any names for the facebook support groups? I would love any information you are willing to share. This helps ease my mind in a lot of ways! Sure! I am part of the groups \"Hydrocephalus\" and \"Hydrocephalus support group\". They are both private but pretty quick to add you. My daughter was diagnosed with a fatal brain disorder called holoprocencephaly. We were told she would be hospice. They said small cerebellum severe hydrocephalus, possible acc, no visualization or the septum pelucidem and behind in growth. She was misdiagnosed with the hpe, they have since treated the hydrocephalus, and though delayed she is doing awesome. You are welcome to check out her Facebook page Miracle Girl Clarissa Fae. Not all stories turn out well but not all of them turn out poorly either I agree with the comment from tittoilet.\n\nI was born in the 1950's. Back then, no CT-scans/MRI. When I was born I looked and acted (at first) like a normal baby. My head was not enlarged at all. My mom noticed I had trouble sleeping etc. I did (and still do) have an extreme case of Nystamus (rapid eye movement). (I wear soft contacts that do slow some of the rapid eye movement down a little bit) There were things I could never do as a kid, skip, hop etc. ***It took me 3 yrs to learn how to ride a bike***. My parents took me to countless doctors. One doctor at the University of Michigan (I was 5 yrs old at the time) gave my parents t***he best advice they could have EVER been given.***\n\n***\"Do not try to coddle her. Let her do what she can. If she cannot do it, she will not. All humans know their limits, and your daughter will too.\"***\n\nSure, my mom had a lot of anxious days. I damned near killed myself learning to ride that bike but by gosh, I did it! I graduated HS in the top 10 of my class (I was 5th) and went onto Nursing School.\n\nI was a teen model, I have had singing lessons and spent years playing all kinds of musical instruments, piano &amp; organ. (I can play everything in Winds but I cannot play the drums, my coordination is off for that, LOL!) I teach piano to children.\n\nI was not properly diagnosed with Hydrocephalus until I was 30 yrs old. I was immediately shunted. I have had headaches and vomiting issues all my life, and the neurosurgeon said at the time of the first surgery that he really did not know if by being shunted would get rid of the vomiting (or the constant feeling as I am newly pregnant with morning sickness) and my headaches can be OTT sometimes, so no, there was no magic pill for that.\n\nNowadays things are so much better as far as the knowledge &amp; the technology we have today for diagnosing and dealing with Hydrocephalus. While this has not been proven, the OB/GYN my mom had when she was pregnant with me stopped her labor (he wanted to sleep) and used what was called a \"saddle block\" at the time. The Chief Neurosurgeon that I see said that doing those things in labor probably did not help matters either. (Most babies with suspected Hydro are born via C-section today).\n\nJust to let you know, I married, had 4 children (and I had each of those children with no pain meds, no epidural, etc. My labors are ridiculously short...the longest labor I had was 3 hrs and 10 minutes (my 4th child) the shortest 1 hr, 15 minutes.(my 2nd child).\n\nI drive, swim, I have a BSN (Bachelor's) degree in nursing. I am not crazy about heights, but a lot people are. I drive, I sew (make all my own clothing) knit, crochet, etc.\n\nWhat I am trying to say here is try not to put your child in a box. Celebrate the highs and do not get too uptight about the lows (consider them small stuff). Do not get caught up in the constant running the kid to the doctor or worrying constantly about symptoms, etc. As far as my Hydrocephalus, I take each day as it comes and rarely think \"OMG is that a symptom of Hydro, or is there something else wrong.???\"  Try to live a normal life with your child\n\nThe waiting and seeing is hard I know, but do not worry until you have to (in other words you will know more once the baby is born.)\n\nAgain, had my parents hoovered over me every single minute, I would have never married, lived in Germany with my husband (he was stationed near Frankfurt while in the US Army.) or been able to raise four productive amazing adults. We have 7 grandkids too. I also learned to speak fluent German when we lived near Frankfurt. Learning the language enable my hubs &amp; I to go with other GI's and their wives all over Germany &amp; Europe simply because no one else in our group of friends had the grasp of the German language as I did and I did not know a single word of German until I moved there 30 days after we married.\n\n(BTW, I have a sister-in-law who was born with a cleft-lip and palate (surgically repaired) and the way my MIL treated her had long lasting effects. My SIL has never married, etc. It is a stark contrast to watch my SIL and realize the gift my parents gave me just by listening to that doctor so long ago. That same doctor suggested my parents walk thru one of the units in the hospital with gravely ill children. My mom had always said ***\"When we walked thru that unit/floor I suddenly realized that your medical issues were nothing compared to what other children were diagnosed/dealing with.\"***   Mom was right. It was a great lesson for her. (she said.)\n\nTake care, and feel free to DM me if you like.", "Your revision experience? Hey all. This is partly vent and partly questions about your experience (I have been lucky I guess bc I have only had one revision and I am mid 20s)...\nAnyway, I had similar symptoms to what I am experiencing now earlier this year and it was determined to be just a bad migraine (history of migraine). My parents are kind of acting like that is what they think it is as well. I saw my neurologist earlier this week and discussed everything I am experiencing with her and she ordered a CT to check etv function (waiting on order to go through)... anyway:\nRecently I have have had a range of my normal symptoms and some new chaos happening recently and will divide it into categories and you tell me if you have experienced anything similar?\n+Migraine that does not respond to meds for very long (like abortive meds that usually get rid of it completely only work for 30 min then it is like I never took meds, happened earlier this year too)\n+Heavy head (common)\n+Sleeping is all I want to do (happened earlier this year)\n+moving head makes me nausea/dizzy (severity of earlier this year)\n+intermittent vision change (eyes see different colors, brand new)\n+Pain closing R eye (common with my migraines)\n+sleeping on back/ Right side = feel like I am hanging upside down (slightly elevated is most comfortable) (common)\n+Slightly tacky at neuro appt (brand new)\n+stiff neck (brand new when accompanied with headache)\n+pain touching R half of head/ etv reservoir (happened earlier this year)\n+hormone changes? (New)\nAny advice? What have you experienced? Do symptoms change between your revisions? My only revision b4 now showed dull headache and lack of energy/ wanting to sleep a lot I recently had a revision on an ETV and went to a shunt again, which I had before ETV.  I found weird symptoms in the week before ETV failure, started with a strange positional headache that was too mild to be a concern, then I remember going for a run and feeling like I could not feel the ground in front of me.  2 days later I got a severe headache and had operation that night.  So yes, I have noticed a lot of different symptoms, and a lot of similar ones to you.  Good luck with it. So I have had about 200 revisions so I do not know if the symptoms were always the same but they were definitely always very similar in progression. I do not remember colour blindness happening every time but also I only ever found out about that when I had the test done, I never noticed it on my own. So I was really good at progressive blindness until it was pretty much completely blind without me noticing it haha. At the end of the day, if you think there is an issue, just get it checked, worst case they say it is not pressure and fix the pain instead. I hope you feel better soon; I have had a history of migraines and to me, they are hard to distinguish between that and a shunt malfunction. I only present with a headache that will not go away with medication when my shunt is failing. After having 30 revisions, you would think I would be able to tell the difference between a migraine and a shunt failure headache, but I just cannot and go to the hospital regardless.", "Had Brain Surgery in March and wanting to move out This is going to sound complicated but long story short I have moved in with my godmom twice and am fed up with her animals tearing up the house , my bedroom door (I do pay rent and have replaced the door before and it is torn up again).

I just could not deal with that situation either. Hope you find a solution. I am looking at psychiatric positions in hospitals.  Might get a place with my sister. Just a note - are you allowed to drive this soon post surgery? In the UK it is 6 months minimum before you are allowed to drive again. Just thought you should check as it could invalidate your insurance if you were unlucky enough to have an accident if you were driving when you are not supposed to No I could drive. Ah ok must be different rules where you are :) just thought I would make sure! :) Yeah I am in Texas but if I had seisures,  it would be different.  Many hydro patients start driving after about a month.  After the shunt revision I had in 2018, I started driving three weeks later. \n\nThanks for checking on me!", "Coping with an acute awareness of your shunt reservoir? I have got 3 shunts, but the most recent (installed in '03) bothers me quite a bit because I am constantly aware of 'something' sitting just behind and slightly above my right ear. The feeling is really hard to describe...almost like a pencil tucked behind the ear, but underneath the skin. The feeling can be very distracting sometimes and often elevates to painful.  Painkillers do not do shit, and medical cannabis only does so much to take my mind away from it, but it is a losing battle.  \n\nMy neurosurgeon says that all of my scans show it to be functioning properly. has the shunt bothered you since it was inserted back in 03 or did it just recently start bothering you?  \n\nlast year I went to a trampoline park and after that I felt my shunt a lot more than before as if it got dislodged while I was on the trampoline.  It did not turn into pain that needed pain killers it just started feeling like it was there in my body.  I had my shunt replaced back in february of this year but they could only take out so much of the old one due to calcification so parts of the old one are still in my abdomen and the new shunt is draped over top of the piece of old one.  This I can feel too I have always been more aware of it than the old ones, but the 'hyper-awareness' comes and goes.  Maybe you need to find ways of learning to ignore it? They might have therapies to retrain yourself to stop focusing on it like they have for tinnitus.

You are welcome, and thank you as well!", "VP Shunt mystery/seeking help Glad I found you guys \ud83e\udde0\n\nUltimately I have  a question about my VP shunt, not looking for medical advice,  just seeing if ANYONE has had a similar experience, or has any clue what might be going on. The doctors sure do not.  \n\nBackground: I am 33F and live in New England,   USA .\n\n I had a benign brain tumor removed from my cerebellum in two surgeries,  when I was 13 and 15 (1999 &amp; 2001). The tumor was massive, about the size of my fist,  and slow-growing. It was attached to my brain stem, so in '99 they were only able to remove  80% of the tumor. They monitored me closely  following my first surgery, I had  MRI's every 3 months for over a year, until eventually the worst case scenario happened and the tumor reestablished the blood supply and began growing again. Surgery number 2 was able to completely remove the tumor as it has pulled away from my brain stem. \n\nDuring my first surgery I also had a VP shunt put in to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid, and there was a lot. \n\nQuestion/Concerns: I have had the same shunt for over 20 years now and literally never had a problem,  no replacements or fixes. The thing is a beast, and apparently that is pretty incredible.  \n\nOver a year ago I started getting pain and swelling in the incision site on my abdomen. I am pretty thin, and you could/can literally see a lump of swelling right where my shunt disappears into my abdomen, where ir drains into my stomach. The lump is painful, and is located directly aboveb the incision. \n\nWhen I first had it checked out I was sent for a CT to see if it was a hernia. Scan came back perfectly clean. \n\nThen, the pain and swelling went away. Completely. This lasted for months. \n\nLast November it came back with avengeance. For seemingly no reason. I had not fallen, changed meds (im.on no medications, have not been for years) hurt myself exercising, been in an accident.  Nothing. \n\nI ended up calling the neurologist and they sent me to the ER thinking it must be the shunt itself malfunctioning,  after all it is never had a tune up.  \n\nThey checked every part of my shunt, blood work  (to look for infections), did more scans (xray and CT), and found nothing. They also checked my organs. Liver and pancreas are functioning great. No hernias. \n\nI also get extremely dizzy when I bend over, or lay down flat on my back. This happened when I first had surgery,  but went almost entirely away for years and years. Now, it is back and it cannot be a coincidence. \n\nSo, I then met with a neurosurgeon.  He felt my belly where the pain is, could feel the swelling,  made me cry from pushing on it. But ultimately told me he did not know what to do. I lost  it, started balling, just wanted some answers and am scared and frustrated that no one seems to have a clue. He ended up saying if I am absolutely sure I want to remove the shunt, we can. He is a surgeon,  that was the only comfort he could offer. But obviously that is a major surgery and I am not going to just do that. \n\nThe swelling and pain come and go in large time frames.  It will be here for weeks, sometimes months, then recede for a few months usually. Right now it is painful and inflamed,  the swelling is all around my incision and travels up my shunt towards my chest slightly. \n\nRight now it is extremely painful, swollen and inflamed. I have a photo of the swelling if anyone thinks that would help. I just cannot attach it to this post \ud83d\ude44\n\nIt is entirely baffling. If anyone has ever experienced anything like this PLEASE let me know your thoughts. I had EXACTLY what you are experiencing.  I had a shunt placed in 1995 due to a large benign tumor (size of a large lemon) at the base of my cerebellum.  They removed the back of my skull to remove the tumor and placed a VP shunt in my head five days later.  That shunt lasted until 2015.....20 years.\n\nThe second surgery I had was in 2015, the tubing broke off in my neck so I had to have the whole thing replaced.  Fast forward to 2017, I  start having transient pain in my abdomen, close to the incision site.  I went to the dr on and off to see what it was, as at times it was debilitating and would wake me up at night.  Other times it would not hurt at all.  Well, my husband found me on the bathroom floor in 2019 having a seizure, he rushed me to the hospital and found out I had a pseudocyst that had become infected and caused me to have a severe brain infection.  My neurosurgeon told me I was about 12hrs away from death when I arrived at the hospital.  I spent 2 full weeks in ICU while the infection in my brain cleared up.  They had to remove my old shunt an I had to have an external one  until they placed a new shunt on the opposite side of my head about two days before I was released.\n\nI would suggest going to see your neurologist and asking them to just check out the possibility that this is the cause of your pain.  If you have any questions please ask! I have read about those, that is one of the on reasons I could find as to why my symptoms would come and go!\n\nBut I have not had anything done to my shunt. My dog DID pull me on my face a few years ago before all this started. Maybe something tore and could have created this pseudocyst? That is the only injury I have had that could have possibly done any damage. \n\nSo, when you went to see the doctor before,  when you started having symptoms,  what did they say? Did they do imaging and saw nothing? Would this cyst show up on a MRI? That is the only thing they have not done yet. \n\nWhy do they need to replace the shunt after all these years? Meaning,  our shunts certainly are not doing anything,  right? So why not just take it out? \n\nThank you so much for responding to this \u2764\ud83d\udc9c\u2764\ud83d\udc9c\u2764\ud83d\udc9c I went to the doctor on multiple occasions.  I know I had a CT and it did not show up.  They kept telling me it was my gallbladder......I honestly do not know if they found out I had the cyst until I was in the operating room.  I was so doped up everything is a blur.  The reason I had surgery was because they tested my  spinal fluid and found out I had a massive brain infection.\n\nHonestly, you only have to have the shunt replaced if it fails.  Mine is doing it is job, I would be dead without it.  The tumor I had was so large it blocked the way my brain drains  spinal fluid naturally, so I have to have it.  You probably still need yours as well.  \n\nGood luck with everything.  I hope you get a resolution to your issue.  :) Can I ask if your symptoms got worse before this happened? Like, did they get progressively more painful, intense, or did the pain and swelling stay about the same? \n\nI am in a bad way right now. The pain is more intense than it has been, consistently, and it is inflamed and bulging out of my abdomen. It hurts more when I breathe deeply, or cough, or laugh. Basically when my abs tighten, like when it is pushed on from behind if that makes sense. Also very, very sore to the touch - but that is always been the can when my symptoms are flaring. But this intense, stabbing pain is mostly new - I have had it happen a few times in short bursts, but never for days. \n\nI am a bit concerned. Yes, that is exactly what happened to me before I passed out.  You need to get someone to check for a pseudo cyst before it is too late.  I am not trying to scare you but you could die if that is what it is. Something similar happened to me.  I had my shunt for 3 months.  My abdominal incision was swollen to the touch and when pushing or leaning on the incision, I felt a reverse effect of the fluid.  I could feel the fluid going back up the shunt and into my head. Possibly not into my brain as the shunt is one way valve but I did not think that sensation was normal.  Anyway, after weeks of telling my surgeon and dr something was wrong, I began to have severe neck and head pain.  I suggested that possibly the shunt was working but maybe it was pooling into one spot and not fully capable of draining.  I was told that was not possible.  Long story short, I am day two post op.  They found a kink in the tube, the tip had implanted itself into the fat of my abdominal vs the cavity.  And it was infact pooling and causing the shunt not to drain.  It is unfortunate but you really have to be your own advocate.  If you feel something is not right, keep pushing and insisting.  Hope you feel better soon!  I was miserable for a few weeks but feel so much better now. Hi!\n\nAre you already involved in the local chapter of the Hydrocephalus Association? If you are we may have met at some point. I am in Massachusetts. You can find us on Facebook State of Massachusetts Hydrocephalus Association Community Network. Did the swelling in your abdomen come and go, though? That is the weirdest oart of all this - it is totally fine for months at a time. Then, it starts hurting,  sometimes it is just mild irritation, but like right now it is stop you in your tracks, take your breath away, intense  stabbing pains. It is mildly better today than it was Thursday and Friday, but still worse than it is ever been before. And this has been going on oj and off for over a year and *supposedly* \"it is not the shunt \" \n\nYes, it fucking is. Excuse my mouth, but it is the shunt. I am calling the neurologist tomorrow,  we will see where it gets me. With my luck the swelling and pain will have dissipated by the time they can see me \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2c Yes some days it would be more swollen than others but I continued to get worse.  This is not that difficult to confirm I do not understand why they do not order a\nCT scan or MRI to check.  If the pain comes back, I would suggest going to the ER. I have been to the ER and had CT and shunt series xrays done. They found nothing. The pain is mildly better today, going to see how it is tomorrow and if it is still bad I am going to call the neurologist and insist I need to be seen. Problem is, if it is not bad then it is just a waste of everyone is time. For the last 3 days it is been so bad I could not even take a deep breath without doubling over in pain. Now that it is almost Monday and I can actually go to the doctor it is subsiding. Go figure. So, we will see. My thoughtn is it is a pseudocyst, leaking  CSF fluid in my abdomen. I have all the symptoms,  and it is easy to miss on a scan. But, who knows. All I know is something is seriously wrong with my shunt and I would rather catch this before something bad happens to me. I had a pseudocyst develop at the distal end of the shunt once before. I did not have any symptoms except for what appeared to be a small hernia at the site of my last surgery in my abdomen. I went to my GP who referred me to have an abdominal ultrasound. Once they were able to local the distal end of the shunt, they could see a pocket of fluid that had developed at the end of my shunt. My CSF was draining into the pocket and we have no idea how long it was doing that for. If I were you, I would ask to have an ultrasound of the distal end of the shunt. \n\nThis is a photo of the swelling, lump/bulge in my abdomen. If you look closely you can see my incision, and the lump is directly above it. Right side, under my rib cage. I just put a photo up of what mine looks like in thecomments. I know it is not super easy to tell how much it sticks out, but it is pretty significant when it is flared up. I will be calling the neurologist tomorrow, even though it is starting to subside. Go figure. Mine looked similar to yours. I am glad to see that you are going to ask your doctor about it. Keep us updated! Just wanted you to know I am doing alright! \n\nPain is better,  and I am fucking pissed. I am not going to waste my time or the neurologist if my symptoms are essentially gone. I mean, it is still sore and lumpy,  but it is about 25% of what it was Wednesday evening through Saturday evening.  \n\nI have noticed my shunt itself seems to be aching, the part on my head. It is like a weird headache,  just on my shunt. That started last night, but it is really more annoying than anything. So, I do not know. I am frustrated that things are slowly subsiding honestly.  It will be back, that is a guarantee.  Maybe I should just go to the ER next time shit gets bad. \ud83e\udd14\n\nEdit: I also added a photo of what the \"lump\" looks like in my abdomen. I realize it is not that easy to tell how much it sticks out though You still need to be checked out.  I would go months without any pain at all and then it would start back up.  I am not joking- it was on and off for almost 2 years.  Please get it checked out, for real.    I am glad you are not hurting at the moment, not please get yourself looked at. Are you still doing alright? Yes, I am still kicking! Things have subsided almost completely. Still a few weird twinges of pain in my abdomen and in my head (right on the shunt, been getting weird, pulse like headaches for just a split second), but the lethargy has stopped to. Today was the first good, normal, day I have had for almost a week. \n\nI know I need to be looked at, and I am just waiting for this shit to hit the fan again. I will be marching my disgruntled ass into the biggest ER in Maine on day one of my abdomen swelling, *trust me*! I just want them to have something to look at that is indisputable. I regret not going last week/weekend. \ud83d\ude4e\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1e\n\nBut, it will be back. I had the pain on and off for two solid years.  Please get an MRI with contrast to see if anyone can see anything. I have talked to some other people who say it is also a pseudocyst,  was told by like 7 other people  (i shared my story elsewhere just to see how many people i could get to weigh in). Was told by most that it would not show up on a MRI, but to ask for an abdominal ultrasound. Either way, yes I will get checked out! Let me know what you find out!!", "Indoor Skydiving Many of you may have been told by your neurosurgeon not to go skydiving. Would this also apply to those indoor skydiving tunnels? Never felt like hydrocephalus has held me back until I saw that those exist \ud83d\ude05 I have never been told that I could not go skydiving.  I imagine the issue is the pressure changes involved so indoor skydiving really should not be an issue.  To be clear, I am not a doctor, just someone with hydrocephalus.  If you are not sure, please ask your neurosurgeon. Absolutely just wanted to see if anyone else has looked into this I have gone skydiving twice and enjoyed every moment. I asked my neurosurgeon (he was the one that was going to say if I could go skydiving or not, my parents did not think he would let me) and he said he did not have any issues.

It affects people in all walks of life, from every socioeconomic background.\n    One to two of every 1,000 babies are born with hydrocephalus, making it as common as Down\u2019s syndrome and more common than spina bifida or brain tumors.\n    Hydrocephalus is the most common reason for brain surgery in children.\n\n**There Is No Cure**\n\n    There is no medical therapy to treat hydrocephalus. The only effective treatments are surgical.\n    While many people are helped by surgery, many more need further operations to stay well. Of the over 40,000 hydrocephalus operations performed annually (one every 15 minutes), only 30% are the patient\u2019s first surgery to treat hydrocephalus.\n    The medical costs for hydrocephalus are over $1 billion per year, yet the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invests less than $1 million per year in hydrocephalus treatment.\n\n**There Is a Crisis in Diagnosis**\n\n    A recent study estimates that 700,000 older Americans are living with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). This disorder often goes undiagnosed and untreated, with an estimate that up to 80% of cases remain unrecognized.\n    Of the estimated 5.2 million individuals diagnosed with dementia, 10-15% are believed to actually have NPH, which is treatable.\n    Research suggests that treating hydrocephalus in the elderly population would reduce U.S. health care expenditures by $25,000 per patient, or $184 million, over five years. Mistaken placement in an extended care facility or nursing home, for example, costs considerably more than the minimal extra care someone might need to stay at home after appropriate treatment for NPH.\n    Hydrocephalus also goes undiagnosed and untreated in younger adults, leading to substantial workforce loss and health care costs.\n\n**There Is a Crisis in Access to Care**\n\n    Doctors are sometimes understandably reticent to take on complicated hydrocephalus cases, particularly in adults, because little is known about the disorder. We do not always know what causes it, and we do not yet know how to make these people well.\n    There are fewer then ten centers in the U.S. specializing in treating adults with hydrocephalus.\n\n**More Effective Treatment Is Needed Now**\n\n    Over the last 50 years, there has been no significant improvement in hydrocephalus treatment and no progress toward prevention or cure.\n    Research is essential. At the very least, we need better treatments, with more positive long-term outcomes, and diagnostic tests that are accurate, cost-effective, and noninvasive.\n\n", "Long term effects of teen hydrocephalus?

As in chronic hydrocephalus. So I am not really sure.  Rather or not he has a shunt, especially since you do not know, he should definately get checked out. With people with shunts those can be symptoms of shunt failure, or if it was not a chronic case, it could mean that it came back.

I have also had intermittent extreme pain along the track and in my abdomen where it terminates. After years and years of being told I am fine I have come to accept I am going have to deal with the occasional pain although it essentially leaves me useless until it passes.\n\nDoes anyone else get pain along with track? Have you found out what caused it?\n If I had to guess, on a shunt and catheter of that age, it is probably just calcification. \n\nI have a shunt from \u201891 that has not really given me any pain but a newer shunt placed in 2016 has given me a lot of trouble with abdominal and shoulder pain. Doctor says it is \u201cirritation of the diaphragm\u201d, most likely because of the new catheter.  I also get the pain in my shoulder, it sort of radiates down. Calcification is something I need to look into because I am not familiar with that. Did you have the pain with your newer shunt from the beginning?  With calcification, basically your body just builds up deposits around the catheter over time, not a whole lot can be done for that from what I know. \n\nThe shoulder pain is the worst! That is exactly how it feels for me as well, sharp pain down the shoulder and abdomen. Yes, the irritation started basically right after surgery and was a real problem for me during the first few months. I believe the pain came from the catheter trying to adhere and settle in. Over time, I found that keeping my abdomen and head warm really helped. I used to sleep shirtless all the time, that has not been possible for me since the surgery. Little things like using a heating pad during flare ups or sleeping with a beanie have done wonders, the pain is a lot less frequent now.  Thanks for the info! I swear finding other people, let alone adults, who have a shunt for hydrocephalus is like finding other members of a secret society.  No problem, I came here right after surgery looking for info myself, and found comfort reading other people\u2019s experiences. Been here ever since trying to return the favor. \n\nI know exactly what you mean, haha. It is a shitty club, but at least we can be here to support each other.  I have a high tolerance for pain, but the shunt pain can drive me to tears. That was the case last night when I was at work and it is like how do you even begin to explain that to someone who has not experienced it?

Have you tagged now as shunt-bearers and will consult you guys on behalf of her in the future.\n\n:) \u201cShunt-bearers\u201d... I love that! I also had my shunt placed in 1989. I just had an appointment with my neurosurgeon yesterday. I have two fractures in my neck area. I am getting a complete removal done in 2 weeks. They are going to have to remove it in 5, or so, pieces due to calcification. Since it attaches they will have to clip it and work it out. I would not classify my shunt as painful but i would say it gets uncomfortable depending on how I sleep and if I position my neck in certain positions for an extended period of time. I get random sensations along the tract regularly.  This is one of my fears. Best of luck with your surgery! I take it this is your first revision? Have you outgrown needing it or will it be replaced?  Yep. It has not been touched at all since it was placed. Dr. is going to determine if I am still shunt dependent once he goes in, but he said his expectation is that I am no longer going to need it. The thing up in the air right now is how the old shunt is going to do coming out of my brain. If the risk of a brain bleed arises they may have to leave it in place.

I guess the difference would be that I was able to avoid having a shunt replacement surgery and instead did a ventilatorostomy My understanding is that after the hemorrhaging scar tissue can form  which can create an obstruction which results in hydrocephalus. In my daughters case, she had a grade 3 ivh, they scanned her daily hoping the pressure in the third ventricle would normalize, but it did not so they intervened surgically by placing a shunt. At that point the bleeding had already stopped. Because shunts are considered forever the doctors try and avoid having to place them. If a patient has an intraventricular hemorrhage that does not stop bleeding they should not be considered to have hydrocephalus. I do not know how that should be treated, but it would be a presumably worse situation. The body has a cascade of events to stop internal and external bleeding. So the bleeding no matter how severe just stops by itself through body processes (but secondary issues like hydrocephalus get treated)? Yep! Hemostasis is pretty neat. The body can do a lot of cool stuff. So many mechanisms and feed back loops in play to keep us working.", "Does anyone here know if Hydrocephalus can an have a negative impact on intelligence?

Lol I was j/k, the Hydrocephalus card will do fine My gf said \u201cwelcome to the club\u201d Welcome friend. You will be fine. Push on and keep us updated. Will do, thank you Welcome, brother! Your induction will be swift and wholesome. \n\nMake sure to move your neck a lot, and try not to favor your left side when you sleep, otherwise it will get stiff as fuck and they will not let you leave the hospital lol\n\nWhen I first got my shunt placed, I did not want to put any pressure or anything on it, and just kept my head cockles to the left to avoid putting pressure on my right side where my shunt was placed. I had to stay in the hospital an extra 2 days for physical therapy to loosen up my neck before they discharged me. Do not be like me lol Duly noted, thanks for the advice Thanks Welcome, comrade. It is not a club you would perhaps choose to be in, but it is a friendly bunch. \n\nAlso, I second /u/ragergage - PT was not happy with my neck position because I was trying to make the stitches not hurt. I hope you heal well. Make sure to focus on your head\u2019s posture. I was 5 when I got my last revision and did not pay attention to it. Now my head sits comfortably slightly tilted to the right (toward the shunt line). Just a few degrees off, but noticeable if someone looks long enough. I was DX'd at 17 months, but I was very likely born with hydrocephalus, or acquired it very soon after. How did you acquire yours, OP? Sorry to welcome you to this exclusive club but we are here if you have any questions or just want to vent. When did it start for you? Thank you Duly noted thank you Well about 13 years ago I started getting bad headaches, MRIs confirmed that I had an inoperable mass in my brainstem that was constricting the flow of CSF from my brain (Obstructive hydrocephalus), it was not too bad so we monitored the buildup and the growth for years.  Fast forward a few weeks ago and all of my motor and cognitive functions go out the window, slurred speech, impaired vision, I cannot walk and my body starts shaking uncontrollably, the pressure was too much, it was scary, I felt like someone else was in control of my body. &gt;Thank you, I think it is good to have a support group, like minded people who understand your struggle I have always had issues with my brain but the hydrocephalus started acting up these past few weeks, it was scary because I went from some symptoms to barley able to walk in the span of 2 weeks, I will copy my answer from above here -   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well about 13 years ago I started getting bad headaches, MRIs confirmed that I had an inoperable mass in my brainstem that was constricting the flow of CSF from my brain (Obstructive hydrocephalus), it was not too bad so we monitored the buildup and the growth for years.

You are welcome! Welcome to r/hydrocephalus! We are a very supportive community! Welcome! Nice of your surgeon to cut all of your hair. My surgeon only cuts the half that he is operating on. I work at the same hospital that my surgeon works at and with my last revision this past October, I had a fellow coworker get the clippers from the OR so I could cut all of my hair off. The orange Chloraprep is a pain to get out of your hair. That was all me, been rocking the baldy for a minute I never got a card :/ I was j/k, I never got a card either, I ended up getting one with my medical bracelet, a literal lifesaver", "No more awareness in Texas ", "My pain leaves me breathless. I am aware of my head pain constantly, both the increased pressure and the sensation of the shunt resting on the surface with the skin stretched tightly over it(it is really hard to accurately describe, but the back right quarter of my head has a strange sensation that never disappears).  The pain is often so intense that my breathing becomes laboured and my heart rate increases dramatically while I am sitting still.  Headache meds do not do a goddamned thing and I have zero confidence in attempting treatments like nerve blocks after blocks administered by ER docs had no noticeable or lasting benefit.  Medical marijuana has been the only thing keeping me remotely sane for the last decade, but I realize that it is not a solution and more of a bandaid. I legitimately dread every conscious moment of the day and struggle to sleep at night because of the placement of the shunt. To complicate things further, I found out recently that the neurosurgeon who had technically been in charge of my care for the last few years, though never actually  did anything and I had only seen a handful of times, passed away about 6 months ago, so now I have got to figure out if there is another one that actually knows more than a basic textbook overview of hydro while in the middle of a pandemic and I just want to scream and/or put my head through a wall. It sounds like you could benefit from finding a psychologist as well as a new neurologist. I really do not know much about pain management, but labored breathing is a common symptom of anxiety and stress. ER staff really is not equipped to dole out long term treatment. It is not really their job and because of the pharmaceutical drug abuse epidemic they are pretty stingy with drugs even when people deserve them. It is a huge challenge to find the patience to find good long term treatment, but it is going to be way more effective I am once you get there. I am sorry to hear your struggle. Med mj has helped me substantially as well.  Have you tried increasing the flow rate of your shunt so your pressure headaches are not so intense? That probably sounds like a simplified response, but might be something to look into \n\nHang in there my shunt is not adjustable. the laboured breathing is because the pain inside my skull is overbearing and physically draining. Do you have access to other offices? I know you said your current doc passed away, but do you live in a country with access to other physicians? Or could you travel to seek other physicians? \n\nReason asking, and I am not doc, but if you are still having severe, persistent headaches, it does not seem like the unadjustable shunt is correcting your symptoms. Either it is not shunting enough, or it is shunting too much. Regardless, a second opinion from a new neurosurgeon might deem it appropriate to get you a adjustable shunt to help improve your quality of life. \n\nEither way, my heart goes out to you, friend. I am finally getting back to a stable intracranial pressure from a failure I had back in the fall. Shit is miserable, and people who do not have hydrocephalus do not understand what life is like. I am so sorry you are going through this agony and torment, but know that you are not alone and that shit can be done to help you. This is not a forever thing. please look into dr mark gordon he has a list of supplements that can reduce brain inflammation, maybe it will help you. I am going to be contacting the hospital at some point to figure out whether someone has taken over their patients, or whether I might be able to find a neuro at one of the closer hospitals to me but with covid and all, setting up new appointments unless critical seems like a fools errand. I mean...first step is contacting them, right? The sooner you get your foot in the door, the sooner you will get scheduled for an appointment. \nLike I said, I had a failure in the fall and was not necessarily \u2018critical\u2019, but I bugged my doc enough that we finally found that it was a blood clot in my catheter. And this was after like 3 visits over the course of 2 months. The doctors\u2019 offices are still functioning. \n\nYou just got to be brave and reach out to them, man. Oh my gosh! I have literally the same problem! I have had about 10 surgeries in the past 3 years for hydrocephalus and each surgery has left the constant headache worse than before. Nothing works for me either and I too have lost hope with any treatments. I have become depressed and barely get out of bed most days. The only thing that is kept me going is knowing that I will be embraced by the Lord one day in heaven. Keep going strong and I will be praying for you!", "Seeking advice - Migraine vs ", "Burr Holes in the Morning I do not have a shunt but had hydrocephalus due to a colloid cyst that was resected about 8 months ago and as a result of that have a burr hole in my head where they gained access to use their endoscope. \n\nI have noticed the depth of the burr hole changes throughout the day, especially compared to the morning, has anyone else experienced this? Like near the end of a work day I can clearly feel the outline and depth of the hole but if I lay nearly flat when sleeping I will wake up and it feels quite a bit more shallow. I was hoping someone here may have some insight on this as when I told my neurosurgeon\u2019s PA at a follow up appointment he simply responded with \u201cgravity\u201d and shrugged lol. \n\nTldr; burr hole deep by end of day, burr hole more shallow when waking up, anyone else? Thanks for any replies, I thought perhaps you all would know best so I figured I would post here. I have very few side effects, my greatest being newfound health anxiety that seems to be getting better as time passes. Thanks again! Gravity is the correct answer. In depth explanation - more CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) drains when you are upright. Also more CSF pools in your lumbar thecal sac when you are upright. These two factors mean that you have less CSF pressure pushing the burr hole up when you have been sitting/standing upright most of the day, therefore the hole will feel deeper. Conversely, when you lay flat overnight the pressure in your head equilibrates and there is  more CSF pressure pushing the burr hole up. This is a result of intracranial pressure which changes based on many factors (i.e blood flow, blood pressure, CSF flow, amount of CSF, etc).", "Who has Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida There is a Subreddit that I am trying to fix up called r/Spinabifida.

I was born in 1983 and at that time there was not a lot known of Hydrocephalus and the causes, especially in Albert, Canada where I live.

So I was born with bilateral lambdoid craniosynostosis and have had many surgeries since I was a baby to make room for my brain as it grew. Later in life when I was about 24 I was having headaches so bad that I was unable to keep a job, I was having blackouts and pretty much missed out on a lot of important moments. I ultimately was diagnosed with chiari malformation type 1, because of the craniosynostosis I had to have an unorthodox surgery to fix it. It was called a skull extraction surgery. Basically three pins were placed and everyday for a month in a half I had to turn them three times a day to slowly pull my skull apart to relieve the pressure being put on my brain and spinal cord. After the pins were removed and I had the surgery to remove the brackets they were attached to I formed a literal hole on the top of my head that would not heal, on top of that I was having CSF fluid building up in the space where the skull was pulled apart and was just putting the pressure back on my brain. Fast forward 2 years later 5 more surgeries, 3 different picc lines and a lot of stress, they diagnosed hydrocephalus and placed a VP shunt and closed up the open hole. Now I am in recovery and still having fluid build up! It is extremely frustrating and I am to the point where idk if I will ever have a \u201cnormal\u201d life.

I get my life insurance and medical insurance through my work. However, I also have hospital insurance through AFLAC. There is a death clause that pays out quite a bit.

I had a recent MRI showing \"significantly reduced\" CSF flow in my cerebral aqueduct and 4th ventricle (aqueductal stenosis maybe?). No doctor has mentioned that my fluid is building up anywhere else, though, so I am confused about where the extra fluid is going if it is not going into the ventricle. Does anyone know- if fluid flow is impaired somewhere, will it definitely build up somewhere else? Would impaired flow give you hydrocephalus down the road if you do not already have it? I am seeing a neurosurgeon in October but am just trying to learn as much as I can before then and appreciate any understanding you can help with!! If you have stenosis it just means that there is a narrowing of the channels between the ventricles. It might not be severe enough for you to have symptoms and that your ventricles are draining, just not at a normal rate than someone without the stenosis.", "Is there any way that hydrocephalus could cause dementia/ memory loss at 28 years old? I already had a neuropsychological exam from a psychiatrists office (which the quality was... questionable) but I am having another one this time ordered by a neurologist.  NPH causes some short-term memory loss, however I do not think at your age your hydrocephalus is causing your memory loss. We all experience memory loss from time to time you know, such as where you left your keys, your purse/wallet, etc. \n\nOf course if this is getting serious where you are forgetting where you are, or where you live, or other pertinent issues most people know, I would have that checked out, but I do not think Hydrocephalus is the cause really. \n\nThen too, I tend NOT to blame every issue (medically) that pops up....mainly because I hate going to the doctors, etc. That is just me though, I am one of the worst patients ever. If your shunt is failing, it can cause memory loss, miod swings, disorientation, headaches, increased urination, issues like that. I am 32 and have had a shunt for 3 years. I suffer from mild to moderate aphasia as well as memory loss. My shunt is fine. My memory however is not. Because there are no specific state licensing requirements for the professional designation, anyone with a phd in clinical psychology can call themselves a neuropsychologist. As such, the safest course is to only use the services of those who are board certified in clinical neuropsychology by the American Board of Professional Psychologists - those credentials are commonly noted after their names as \"PhD, ABPP-CN\". Just because someone has a doctorate (e.g., phd psychologists) or a medical degree (e.g., psychiatrists, neurologists) does not mean they have the specialized training and expertise in brain-behavior relationships.   \nSeeing a neurologist is a good idea because changes in cognition, particularly at your age, can be evidence of a serious (but treatable) underlying medical condition. Any /sudden/ changes in cognitive, psychological, or behavioral functioning should be addressed immediately, as such changes could indicate a medical emergency.   \n\n\nGood luck! My comments on this situation are purely based on my own experiences and not facts...But i have hydrocephalus and have experienced that my memory has gotten worse over time.Not to the point of dementia but still faded. Absolutely a sign of shunt malfunction.", "VP Shunt Ligation I developed hydrocephalus after a chiari decompression surgery in 2014. Then had an adjustable VP shunt placed post decompression. For the first 5 years I felt fine. No headaches or problems of any kind, but in 2018 I started developing headaches that would start towards the end of the day, every day. After I went to bed and slept the headaches would usually go away by morning. \n\nMy surgeon team came to the conclusion that my hydrocephalus had corrected itself and the headaches were due to over-drainage. A shunt ligation was recommended and I had the procedure done on December 30, 2020. My shunt is now completely closed off.\n\nHas anyone else had this procedure done? If so, what was recovery like for you? I am still having headaches all throughout the day, and worried this procedure was not the right choice.. Does it take awhile for everything to balance out pressure wise? A shunt cannot be turned off , as far as I know. Did they remove the shunt or catheter? Over draining happens to all shunts at some time or another. The procedure was a shunt ligation. They clamped the tube shut so it does not drain anymore.\n\nEdit: all the hardware is still in place. I would definitely get a 2nd opinion. I have had a ligation done. Unfortunately mine only lasted 3 days before it had to be opened up again. Sorry to hear that. If you do not mind me asking, what symptoms were you having post ligation? I have had issues with over drainage and slit ventricles for many years so my NS ligated the shunt to see if I was actually shunt dependent. These were the days before variable pressure shunts. Post ligation my symptoms were much like a shunt failure, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision and unsteady gait.", "Throwing up only between 3am to 6am. Has that ever happened to you?

The pediatrician has tried to reduce milk and antacids but neither worked and so nobody really knows what is causing it. We tried to book an appointment with her neurosurgeon but they said they do not think it is shunt malfunction and not to come in.

I felt like puking at work and did not know what to do, had to stop.   \nMy brain was slamming against my skull, front and back and side to side with every movement.   \nIt got so bad I had to lay cushions on the living room floor because I could not stand the gravity change walking up the stairs.   \nTurning over, sitting up. Looking at the ground and it rushes at me.   \nI went to the dentist during this time thinking it was related to my TMJ. she gave me a CRANIAL SACRAL message.

NOTHING did.   \nI walked into taco bell (because apparently I am a fatass and cant pass up that pity fast food run) and EVERYONE stared at me, the floor came at my face and I saw every spec on the tile.

Had to let that come down before he placed me with a ventricular-peritoneal  shunt.

Oh ya, 16 staples there too, almost half my head shaved, but this nurse is like LETS SEE YOU WALK. ha ha  \n\n\nI felt like I was punched in the ribs for a few days, painkillers helped ease the transition but if you cant take them, honestly not sure.   \n\n\nThe after part was a whole new story. Mental illness manifested afterwards and it got messy.   \n\n\nHaving a shunt was a burden mentally. now I could care less, maybe that is my depression but whatever happens, happens. make sure to carry your shunt ID card with you in your wallet.

My 25 year old son is in the ICU.  They found him unconscious in his apartment last Thursday.  He could have been there for up to 36 hours before being found.  They do not know why.  His shunt seems to be ok, but I really do not like or trust these doctors, but we are stuck with them at this point.\n\nHe is very confused and keeps asking me to take him home.  I patiently explain that he is in the hospital, but he looks so damn sad.\n\nI am so tired of this.  This doctor will not listen to me.  I do not know what caused him to go unconscious, but I do know that re-programming his shunt to a lower pressure makes him worse.  I know it, the rest of the family knows it, but the doc will not believe me.  He points to a scan and laughs at me.  I do not care about the scan.  I know he is worse because his memory is worse, his gait is worse, his vision is worse and he just has \"that look\".\n\nSo he came here on a helicopter and the first thing they did was lower his pressure, despite the fact that they said his shunt was working just fine.  He woke up and was actually pretty aware. The first thing he said to me after they removed the ventilator was \"What happened?\".  He knew he was in the hospital, etc.  Now, two days later, he is getting more confused, his memory sucks and he looks \"shunty\".  It is because they turned his pressure down...but the doc will not believe me.\n\nThe longer he keeps the pressure low, the harder it will be to move it back up.  When we turn the pressure up, my son's ventricles tend to really over-react and balloon up.  I was afraid at one point that he would never get better because we would never be able to get his pressure up to where he does better. \n\n We managed to do so because I sent him out of state to another doc who put in a different shunt.  My son was doing so well for about a year, then this happened.  I cannot send him back to the other doc now as he is too serious to move and it is across the country.  I am stuck with this horrible doctor.\n\nThe old doc is caring for him and he fucking will not LISTEN to me.  When I say he is been doing great for a year, he says \"Well look at him now!\"  He totally discounts the YEAR my son has had with no headaches, better memory, being able to walk unaided because this episode happened.   He says that the shunt did not cause his episode, but then has re-programmed it.  He will not turn it back up, even though my kid was doing well with it like that for a year.  I feel like I am insane because he acts like what I tell him is impossible and it is not.  I know it is not normal, but my son was not diagnosed until he was 11.  Maybe his brain just developed with high pressure and that is why he does better that way.  Whatever it is...it took me five years and a cross country doctor to get him fixed and now this asshole is going to un-do what I worked so hard to do.\n\nBut then again, I am afraid to flat out demand he do it because I am not a doc and what if I am wrong, but I have been down this road before and it sucks.  What if I put my foot down and my kid gets worse?  What if he goes unconscious again and does not come back?  I am so frustrated.  I know, know, know that he needs that shunt turned back up NOW, but I cannot trust that judgement.\n\nI am very afraid, very sad and do not know what to do.\n\nThe only theory they have come up with for why he went unconscious that makes sense to me is that he was severely constipated.  They think that maybe that blocked up the end of his VP shunt. That makes so much sense to me that he would be fine when he first woke up and now he is not because of the shunt re-programming, but he will not listen.", "Did you all have early puberty?

I am female, I did not but I did develop migraines with aura I started my menstrual cycle in the beginning of the first grade and had large boobs. Yep. Yep, 6 years old I think.", "Weather changes and VP shunt Hi guys, \n\nI (29F) had my first shunt revision in November 2019 in London. My original shunt was put in at 6 weeks and has not needed to be revised. The weather here has been really sunny (26 degrees C) and I have been feeling a kind of stuffy feeling in my head since Saturday evening. Kind of like blocked sinuses but a little higher up. I am not sure if this is the pressure changes in the weather or something more sinister. \n\nAny advice would be great, thank you so much. Typical things to worry about are vomiting, pressure pain or nausea when lying down or sitting up, headaches. I know for a lot of people there is more symptoms from the shunt than there are talked about. Like a lot of people deal with frequent headaches, or pain around the side of the shunt. Hopefully what you are dealing with is more like allergies and not a real shunt issue. I think it never hurts to contact your doctor and let them know though. but really because you are saying the weather has changed and it is sunny, my first thought is allergies. Maybe try taking a Claritin for a few days and see if you notice a difference? Sounds more like allergies, but I do not know what type of hydrocephalus you have. CSF circulates from deep the brain down towards the brain stem before circulating around the spinal cord and brain. It is then reabsorbed around the brain and filtered down through various sinuses. Typically people with hydrocephalus have some sort of obstruction or area where pressure builds up in or between ventricles which are the areas deep in the brain. I have never actually read of any issues with the reabsorption regarding the sinuses. Also keep in mind these are not the nasal sinuses or any of the others located on the front of your face. Hi, thanks for your reply. I have tried to contact my neurosurgeon and could not get through but I have booked a call with my doctor tomorrow morning. I have taken antihistamine but it did not really help. My first thought was allergies but when it did not get better, I thought it might be the shunt. Hopefully the doctor can help somewhat I have had this problem for as long as I can remember.  It is usually in late May early June when the temperature fluctuates and we get frequent thunderstorms that I get the feeling you describe.  I am sort of afraid to go to the local nurse as I work on a college campus and get to use the school facilities.  They are really uptight here about COVID and any sneeze, sinus thing or headache that gets reported gets you quarantined for 2 weeks I have always had weather headaches but only known about my brain tumour  ( and subsequent vp shunt ) a year. I really suffered last week to the point I went to A&amp;e in case it was my shunt or an infection. Persistent but moving  headache, occasional nausea, migraine like symptoms. Thankfully it was ok and feeling much better this week. I am glad you are feeling better. I have an appointment with my GP this afternoon to check my sinuses and to see if it is not anything more serious. How is this going for you? I am in the UK too (NI) and my head has been sore and fuzzy for a few weeks. I definitely think it is a barometric pressure issue. It was at its worst for me when the storms were building and when the thunder and rain started. Hi, it is definitely gotten worse with the storms the last few days. My sinuses have been blocked for a while too. It is easing on and off though so I think it is definitely the pressure. I think I will just have to try and get used to it.", "LP Shunt Pain Please read and answer if you have/had an LP shunt!\n\nI have had an LP shunt since 2002, with the last surgery on it being done in 2006. I have not had a flare-up with increased ICP since then, just migraines. However, a few months ago, I started having a lot of pain in my side where the reservoir is located. I have chronic back pain for multiple reasons, including the shunt surgeries and LPs. But this is different. It gets really bad when I am sitting or standing for any period of time. I have no idea if this is something to be overly concerned about, or if it is just related to my back pain. \n\nFor those who have/had an LP shunt, have you experienced this? What is causing it, and what can be done?", "Another shunt revision So I posted about my low pressure hydrocephalus back in March and I thought the low pressure valve my ns put in would fix everything. But I went to see her today and she planned for me to go back in by 6:30 tomorrow morning for another revision to put my delta valve back in. I am kind of nervous as this will be my 7th surgery within a year and I was wondering if anybody had any tips or advice that they use to calm yourself down before your revisions? Just here to say I hope your surgery goes well.  Heal quickly! Thank you! I do not know you, but am thinking about you and hope it goes well. They are never easy and it takes a strong person to do what we endure. Bump some of your favorite music that reminds you of when you felt the healthiest...\n\nGood luck!!! Thank you! We are all here for you.  I am in Vancouver Canada and rooting for you. \n\nSorry you have had so many revisions, but lucky we live in 1st world countries that have the resources to help us. Please post a reply when you can. Thank you! I am actually heading to the hospital now, I will update if anybody wants me to To calm yourself down, know that this is something you have overcome before, that you will get through it.   Focus on deep, slow breathing. Thank you, I got out of surgery a few hours ago and so far I am okay", "Pregnant with hydrocephalus Hello, I am pregnant and I have hydrocephalus. I was wondering if anyone can tell me about their pregnancy? Or if they got an abortion? Did it effect your shunt or anything? Also I have a VP shunt if that helps. \n\nI was thinking about getting an abortion but my mom keeps saying that it is high risk. There are lots of people with shunts who have babies, congrats on your little one! I had 3 children BEFORE I was diagnosed with Hydro. After I was shunted I asked the Neurosurgeon if it was okay for me to get pregnant because of the shunt placement, and he smiled and said \"It is okay.\" Women who have hydrocephalus can have children.\" \n\nI had my 4th child 2 yrs after my shunt placement. I had an uneventful pregnancy, although my OB/GYN was a little nutty with overdoing Ultrasounds every 6 wks until I asked the Dr. to STOP the Ultrasounds and he did.\n\nSure, a pregnancy with a hydrocephalus patient is usually watched pretty carefully, but none of my doctors mentioned an abortion, etc. I ate well, did all the things I did with my other 3 pregnancies. My Neurosurgeon told me not to worry, things would be fine (I was a patient of the Chief Neurosurgeon, Professor &amp; Chair Of the Neurosurgery Dept.)\n\nI doubt that any OB/GYN would tell you that the pregnancy is \"High-Risk\". Your mom is making a big deal out of this. Just because you have hydrocephalus does NOT mean your child will be born with Hydro. None of my children have Hydrocephalus. They all were good students in school and went on to college and are all married with children of their own.\n\nThere is babies born every year to moms that have hydrocephalus....it is not that uncommon. \n\nNo, I would not get an abortion just because you have a shunt. \n\nCongrats, ENJOY your pregnancy.....You will be just fine. I have a good friend with hydro and a shunt.  She has two healthy kids.  I would not worry My partner has NF1 complicated by Hydrocephalus, which put pressure on her optic nerves and cost her sight when she was 8. Our daughter is now the same age, with the same conditions. The only difference is we caught it, even though we had to be insistent on getting her an MRI, before our daughter lost her sight.\n\nWe were told the only complication between Hydrocephalus and pregnancy is where your drainage tube from your shunt is located. Caesarean sections(C-section) is not an option if you have a drainage tube in your abdomen. Natural birth is your only safe option at that point. Otherwise you risk the death of the mother. I would say consult your neurosurgeon before making any decisions about having / not having the baby. I tried unsuccessfully last year to get pregnant on my own. Before I started I consulted both my neurosurgeon and a fetal maternal medical specialist and I was told there was no additional risk for me.  Also, did you realize the hydrocephalus association has a peer support program where you can reach out and speak with someone. (", "Is it possible to live a normal life with hydrocephalus? I am 22, just had surgery in October. Unfortunately my headaches came back only a couple weeks after having surgery. I have had hydro since I was a baby, but I was pretty lucky, only having one revision at age 11 and that one lasting up until this most recent October. They think it is overdraining and that is why I am having headaches now. I am scared to get a possible ETV or even just an anti siphoning upgrade since they are not sure it would help. I am not realizing just how much this is going to follow me throughout my life and it is causing me some severe depression. I want to go back to school but I cannot because I have to have surgery again. It is hard for me to work but I am trying, and while all my friends have \u201creal\u201d jobs and live on their own I am stuck at home, in pain, worrying, barely able to work a minimum wage job. I had to sell my car because I cannot work yet and stupidly did not save enough for my surgery. Is there any hope, does anyone live a successful life while dealing with hydro? My mother has hydrocephalus and she was able to get her early childhood education degree and worked in schools with children until I was born. It can happen. It may take time and you might not take an \"ordinary\" course/path to get where you want but still. Yea. I have come across a lot of people with careers. A high percentage of people with shunts overdrain. It is a very difficult problem to resolve and can lead to bigger issues ,if it is not fixed. Yes. I was not diagnosed until I was 30 yrs old.(When I was born there were no CT-scans). I have had headaches all my life. When the Hydro was discovered, the Neurosurgeon told me that while I might be able to get rid of the vomiting and the dizziness, he really was not sure, it would all trial and error, and it has been.\n\nI have had 23 revisions and most of them were done in a 55 day period. I have vomiting issues every day, and my headaches range from 2-3 to an 8 and often are so bad, I just cannot handle them. I did  manage to keep my nursing job for quite a few years, etc.\n\nHydro is different for everyone. You have to decide what is important I guess. I am not afraid to tell someone NO, and I have long ago decided I am not Superwoman either. I think that it is pretty common to worry about the \"what if's\" and that in itself can be scary.\n\nDo you have a programmable shunt?\n\nAn EVT might not be as scary as you think. There was one woman that commented on here that said her son did VERY well after having an EVT done. I did ask about having it done (EVT) but was told no.\n\nYou need to start thinking about the small things you have accomplished. Perhaps jotting things down prior to  bedtime and making lists to get things done might make you realize that you can and do accomplish more than you realize.\n\nDue to the fact that you are only 22 yrs old, filing for disability probably is not going to pay you a lot, because you have not worked that long.\n\nIt is better to think of the positive things you accomplish rather than thinking you CANNOT.\n\nYou had surgery in October, that was not that long ago. You did not mention what you do for a job, but maybe a job change might help you.\n\nSorry I was not more help to you. Yes absolutely. Sounds like you are going through som rough times, but you will make it out on the other side stronger. yup I am only 14 and I have had 6 surgeries and I have had a relatively normal life. The only key difference I can think of is having to explain what Hydrocephalus is. I have found a situation that works for me now. It took me a while to graduate college, and then few years of no job or crappy jobs to finally find a sustainable situation. It is hard enough without hydrocephalus. Some days I feel like a fraud, or like I will not ever amount to anything, or that I am just going to get stupider. But over the years I have also tried to instill in my mind the reality that I do not need to tell myself those negative things. Even if they are true, and I somehow guessed my awful future, why allow something that has not happened yet to make me suffer now? It has all that time in the future to cause me suffering. I chose to love and accept myself now, because hating myself will not change the possibility that my life will be a waste.   \n\n\nIn reality no one really knows wtf they are doing. They are just good at BSing a specific aspect of life.  You do not know what the future holds. Allow yourself to be proud of any small victories, especially ones that improve the quality of your life even a little bit. Admit to yourself that you are brave. I know you are brave. You have hydrocephalus like the rest of us. It is forced us to be brave. Hi. Im 36. I had an ETV in august and the first few weeks was very difficult but everything is ok by now. Im playing tennis  very often and im visiting the gym few times a week and no pain...nothing. I feel myself much better than before the operation. So dont be afraid. Everything will be ok with you \ud83e\udd17 This was so inspiring to read.   Just turned 40,  and have **Hydrocephalus.** I have had a couple of headaches now and then when I was younger. I would check up with a neurosurgeon and he would explain what could be the cause. He made sure to get CT scans done before the appointment. That way he can see what the issue might be. There were a couple of times where he said one of the ventricles collapsed so he would have to calibrate the shunt again. I would advise finding and talking to a doctor.", "Options for Overdraining VP Shunt My wife has a programmable VP shunt and a programmable anti-siphoning device referred to as a shunt assistant (ProGAV 2.0 and ProSA 2.0, respectively). The ProSA is supposed to prevent overdraining when upright but it is not. This seems not uncommon as I research online but there is never any solution provided. NS does not believe there is anything wrong with the devices and does not have a plan of action moving forward. I am in the process of getting second opinion with different NS. My question is: What are the options? She cannot continue overdraining and she already has an anti-siphoning device set to highest setting so what is the value in getting a different brand/model if functioning correctly? Anyone been in this situation before? I have an old fashioned valve (VP-shunt) with no gravity or anti-siphoning device. So full overdrainage. The body gets used to that situation. I was told not to change anything as long as the whole system is working. The NS do not have seen that patient improve to much after a change.\n\nBut it is important to see the impact to the brain: Is there an indication of slit ventricles? Does she suffer from neurological problems like headache, vomitting, ...?\n\nIt might be worth to get a second oppinion. Try to find an NS experienced with HC. Experience makes a huge difference.", "Anyone else feel really immature for their age with hydrocephalus? So I am 29 years old and have had a shunt my entire life.  An obvious side effect of my hydrocephalus is optic nerve damage due to pressure which I already know.  One thing my doctors never mentioned is anything with social maturity.  I feel very immature for my age.  Mentally I feel like I am 16-17 years old.  Throughout my life I always felt like I was behind the curve with regards to social development but as time progresses I feel like the gap between the mental age I feel and the age I am and how I should be acting grows.   Can anyone relate?  Do you think it is the Hydrocephalus that could have caused this? I completely get this!! I was honestly thinking about how socially stunted I felt today. My dad was talking about making me get an apartment at school instead of commuting from my parents' house, and I told him if that happened, I would probably go the whole day, maybe days on end, not talking to a single person. \n\nI think it could be indirectly as a result of our hydrocephalus. I think maybe our parents raised us a little bit more cautiously. I think we did not go \"out\" and play, and we did not play sports as much. I think all that and more put us at a slight disadvantage, and it sorta snowballed from there, and so here we are now. \n\nFor reference, I am 20. My take on this is \u201cwho really knows\u201d. I am definitely on the introverted side. I have spent some years thinking about this and there are plenty of people who are introverted without hydrocephalus. I do really well in leadership roles and have a strong personality when I am confident. But I really struggle talking to girls and with social cues in general. I would guess that not much of this is due to my hydrocephalus. \n\nI will say that my abundance of caution is something that I would apply to hydrocephalus because I would always think twice about if some activity or outing without medical treatment in nearby range. \n\nMy most recent job put me in contact with so many \u201ckids\u201d who are nowhere near mature and they are 18-27 and have the maturity of 12 year olds. So whatever it is, I do not know how much you can blame on the condition vs just who you are and the conditions of your upbringing. I too have problems picking up on social cues.  I think that is a common issue with hydrocephalus.  When I was a kid when my mom was still alive she was overly protective.  She wanted me to wear a helmet pretty much everywhere to protect my shunt if I fell.  So I basically had no friends and felt isolated.  My mom passed away when I was 12 of cancer and I stopped taking all the overcautious measures but the social damage was already done.  To make things worse when I was 16 I found out I would never be driving with my eye problems.  All this led to social isolation up until I was 21 when I started college.  Even though no one seemed to care about my condition I still isolated myself out of habit.  So I guess it is some of my upbringing and early life experiences. My son is 8.5 yrs old. Shunted at 1 month old due to hydrocephalus and grade 3 or 4 bleed. He was 7 weeks premie. He acts much younger than his age and is socially awkward. He is very sensitive and I struggle to get him to express his feelings. When he does usually he cries whines or balls his fists sometimes giving angry looks even when not angry. His expressions do not always match his emotions. I fear for him as he will get picked on without being able to pick up on social cues. I recently got him involved with a therapist. Hoping that helps. The first one tried labeling him ADHD before ever meeting him! We are going to a new private counselor who does not diagnose just to get money.He struggled with schoolwork last year. A couple years ago everyone told me its just a \"boy\" thing. \"Girls mature faster\" Not so sure that was the case. 29 and shunted since birth also. I have always been a bit socially awkward. It seems to have improved a bit over the past few years. Not sure about maturity though. I always put it down to a difficult childhood but who really knows.  Do you have issues with the extra fluid putting pressure on your optic nerve? My eye Dr said to watch for that in my son I had many of these issues growing up too interpreting emotions of others.  What is worse though is the eye problem caused by my hydrocephalus.  My 2nd grade teacher even abused me because I was different and never helped me what so ever.  Actually quite the opposite.  At one point she even put my desk in the back corner of the room and put a cardboard wall around it.  Throughout elementary school I was very emotionally fragile.  It was not hard to reduce me to tears which other kids just fed off of.  I think this is where my current social anxiety stems from.  I hope things go better for your son than they did for me.     \n\n\nI have dealt with 2 types of therapists.  Ones that diagnose and prescribe medication straight away just to get money and ones that say everything is fine you are just growing up and that is normal for your age.  Sometimes I think they are not even qualified to be therapists.  \n\nTo this day I have all the symptoms of childhood ADHD and doctors say I am fine.  To put things into perspective I have been side tracked 7 times just while writing this post  \n The damage was initially caused by fluid putting pressure on the optic nerve but that was before my shunt was installed.  Since then no fluid has built up around the optic nerve.  The damage from that initial pressure that built up is permanent  My son is 6years old. Shunt placed at 3 days old and has had 5 shunt failures/revisions, the most recent just on August 28,2018. He is repeating kindergarten for the second time and is much more like my 4 year old daughter in maturity. He is hyper verbal which I just recently discovered is called \"cocktail party syndrome\".  However this makes people think he is more mature than he is but it is actually the opposite. \n\nI worry he will always be a little socially awkward. \n\nHe also has Dandy Walker Syndrome and is missing 3/4 of his cerrebellum. I still feel socially awkward at 29.  I think I had cocktail party syndrome as a young child too.  Make sure your son gets the right teachers at a young age.  Several of mine in the 90s were abusive toward me because of my condition and I could not prove it to anyone.  That messed up my life and gave me a negative outlook on education and caused me to act out a lot more and get it trouble.  The right kind of help goes a long way.  All I got were visual assistants when in reality I needed visual and social help.  This may sound ignorant but I was not aware kindergarten was \"failable\"  I know my school was concerned about me because I could not tie my own shoes in kindergarten.  I did fail gym class for a few years but never was held back by it.  \n\n\n  I do not know if this is a side effect of my hydrocephalus and mental development but I have an irrational fear of making big decisions sometimes even small decisions.  I was not allowed to grow in confidence as a kid because my mom was overly paranoid about my safety and planned my entire life for me.  I think the technical term is called peter pan syndrome.   I sympathize with you and your mother as well. I do fear that I am paranoid and may not let him experience life as he should because I do not want him to become hurt or ill. I think it is hard for people to see that hydrocephalus is such a major medical issue when by all appearances, most kids with shunts \"look\" fine.\n\nHis teacher last year was not helpful, and mostly treated him as a rule breaker and not for his issues and learning disability. His teacher this year however is completely on board with getting him the help he needs so he can function as other children without being \"different\". It will be a long year! \n\nI do think that you realizing you are 29 but functioning as a 17 year old on maturity scale is important. What I mean is if you were 29 and did not notice you were not mature, would be a much different scenario. I hope you are well and wish you the best! Oh my gosh I felt like I was the only one! I get very overwhelmed in certain social settings, and although I am getting better, I generally wait for people to approach me, because I am scared to talk to people. I generally played by myself as a child and had a hard time making friends because I was put in special ed classes due to the affects of my Hydrocephalus. It made me feel like less of a person because I had to go to class in the middle of recess while everyone else played outside. Even though i am 22 now, I find myself reliving those memories and feel like people are judging me even though it was all in my head. Does anyone have advice on how to explain to friends/family that you have Hydrocephalus? I find it hard to explain this to my friends and feel unintentionally attacked when they say I can do something if I really wanted to but cannot because of my Hydrocephalus ;(   I honestly do not know. I have been really academically successful, but socially, crap. Most of my family never really wanted to have anything to do with me, and the other half mostly tolerates me. In a last ditch effort to learn how to socialize normally, I am trying to join a sorority this year at my college. I would not tell people unless you are close to them. Do not lie to people though. ", "iPhone 12 and VP shunts I am considering upgrading to the iPhone 12, but I have a programmable shunt. I heard the iPhone 12 has a magnet, that allows you to stick a wireless charging device on the back. So, I am guessing that is  big magnet. Anyone know about that? Anyone have the 12? Has anyone had experiences with magnets affecting their shunt settings? From \n\nThough all iPhone 12 models contain more magnets than prior iPhone models, they are not expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference to medical devices than prior iPhone models.\nConsult your physician and medical device manufacturer for information specific to your medical device and whether you need to maintain a safe distance of separation between your medical device and iPhone. There are tonnes of Android phones that are superior to iOS phones - just get one of those instead and you never have to give it a thought again in your whole life.

She has screaming tantrums at night many nights and I just get so worried it is related to headaches and that maybe she is in need of a shunt. It would be so relieving if she could describe her distress, but the little speaking she does do goes out the window during these nightly tantrums and it is really just a sing to her to soothe her process.\n\n\n\nWe have not seen a neurosurgeon in about 8 months now and our old one left the practice. She has eczema and it could be growing pains or teething too. She is not grasping at her head but IDK... Just worried. I feel like I never see anyone post about themselves or a child having a diagnosis and not getting a shunt/ETV. Do not want an unnecessary surgery but do not want to fall short of doing everything she needs.\n\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts around what I can do to know if any behavior could be related to a blockage? For those with shunts that have malfunctioned or those who were diagnosed late, were there symptoms of the blockage?  Sorry for long post I cannot really answer your questions as my older child has a shunt but his younger sister does wake up screaming in the night on occasion. She is two and a half years old now. She was late to talk too and was around 16 months walking aswell. Hopefully there is another reason why she screams in the night. She has excema and an egg allergy so I have always blamed this. My daughter was almost exactly the same. Her last MRI was at 24 months, and then we were told that she would not need anymore follow up. She was also slow to walk, they told is it was due to her head being large. She is now a perfectly healthy 4 1/2 year old, and is meeting or exceeding all milestones for her age. \n\nWe were told that if she was ever having any signs of headaches or vomiting, to ask her doctor to schedule an appointment with a neurologist to be reassessed. Maybe start with that? Thanks for sharing your experience. \nI associate developmental delays and behavioral things to having correlation without really knowing. \nI have been thankful she has not gone through the MRIs lately but lack the confidence that it is \"over\" as something that needs to be monitored.

A CT and MRI was done to rule out a tumor and found slit ventricle syndrome. I have visual loss and stuff too. We just moved and i dont see neurologist till next friday to even get into a surgeon.

Women (or men, I do not judge) will see you, if your head is bigger, you will probably just be more attractive to them, just like a little bit. You will be \"cuter,\" but since you are an adult, that will translate to being more attractive. This idea I am taking from how younger kids have proportionally bigger heads when they are little and do stupid things, so their parents will not just give up. They are too cute to give up on.

They had me come back into the office to get them out  Most people will request you come in. My daughters would frequently undo themselves and work their way out. I would just end up pulling out the last couple. It is at least an option at least to remove stitches at home, especially on other parts of the body.  They glued me back together and gave me a couple dissolvable stitches, but I waited maybe 2 months to have a haircut just to be sure.  I had surgery feb 7 and was able to wash my hair after 2 weeks.  I had stitches and not staples (not sure which is better)  but since my operation was a sudden event due to shunt failure and I had cut my hair a week earlier I am still rocking my partially shaved head from the operation.  My head incision site is still a bit to tender and painful to go over it with clippers. I will probably cut my hair end of the month I got it cut yesterday \ud83d\ude01", "New surgery to treat hydrocephalus in babies ", "We are a team of neurosurgeons and APPs from Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Hospital, working during COVID-19 crisis, AMA!  ", "Shunt setting changed &amp; brain zaps This last Tuesday, I had an MRI and saw my neurosurgeon. He said that everything looked great on my MRI but my right lateral ventricle was \u201cslitlike.\u201d Long story short, we found that my shunt was on setting 1 (high draining/sucking) when it was supposed to be on setting 7. We have no idea why it changed. They decided to crank it back to 7 during my appointment and I have been feeling awful ever since. I am dizzy, have pressure behind my eyes and am experiencing frequent brain zaps with and without movement. I do not have a fever. Are these symptoms something to be concerned about? Should I try to ride this out for another week or go to my doctor/ER immediately? When my settings have been changed, it usually takes about a day to recover from (even when the setting is adjusted right). But since last Tuesday? That is a LONG time. You should see your doctor ASAP. ", "My shunt gets infected every year or so &amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year it was really bad. It got infected about three times within like six months. The infection traveled to my brain, my skin, and my stomach. Not just that, it has always been hard to get the hospital that I go to, to listen to me. They never listen when I tell them that I think something is wrong with my port. In saying that, I honestly think because of that dismissal, and all those months of waiting\u2026 while knowing that THIS was festering inside me\u2026 I think that is why it got as bad as it did. But, of course\u2026 it is never the hospital\u2019s fault. They told me it was because I must have did something. \n\n I do not want to go through all at again. But, of course my shunt, port, catheter, whatever you want to call it\u2026 will get infected again. Also, I have a VA shunt, so my heart and lungs can be affected as well. But, my question is if I do not seek treatment, what honestly would happen? And if I do die, how long do I have? \n\nIf cancer patients have a choice, we should too. Right? Or is that too out of line to ask? This is an an incurable rare disease that just keeps happening over and over again. And even when you are not acutely terminal, you still have chronic signs and symptoms of it. You are not just in remission. So, why cannot we have a choice? What makes you think it keeps getting infected?  What has been your most recent treatment concerning the infection? I am very sorry for your bad experiences. As much as i know there are catheters that are impregnated with some kind of antibiotics in order to reduce the risk of a shunt infection, maybe you could ask your neurosurgens if this would be an option once you have to have another revision? I guess your whole shunt has been replaced with every infection? I do not have much experience with this condition tbh and therefore do not have answers but I think it is a great idea to talk to your primary. That it is bad enough to cause you suicidal ideation is concerning and breaks my heart. Tell them what you have told us about the infections and that it is negatively effecting your mental health as well, maybe they can help you find a new neuro team for a second opinion or investigate the cause of your infections. Are you seeing any type of counseling? I would suggest that first and foremost. It sounds like you are dealing with PTSD like symptoms because of your last infection. Instead of all these plans you are laying out, I would seek some help that can help you move on from your past experience. I know you said it is gotten infected multiple times but at the end of the day the last time could be the last time", "Does anyone on here have slit-like ventricles, or slit ventricle syndrome, with headaches? Male, 21. Born with hydrocephalus, it grossly failed in 2009 at age 11/12. Codman programmable shunt was put in, and all was good up until about 3 years ago. Since then, I have developed headaches that have become more and more common, and for the last year, they have been non stop 24/7. I have had so many cat scans, all \u201cnormal, no evidence of hydrocephalus, slit like ventricles\u201d etc. they have changed the setting, but ventricles do not budge and headache does not go away. That being said, the headaches are bearable...they are not horrible, but they are constant. Neurosurgeons are not sure what to say, one thinks it is either \u201cpartially working, or I am not shunt dependent\u201d.  I have no papilidema (not sure if i spelt that right) no mental disturbance, etc. only the headache. It is been like this for years. Surgeons are quick to say \u201cjust a headache, unlikely due to shunt if you ONLY have a headache\u201d  I have had it adjusted, nothing. Even when it is set at 200 or at 0, I feel the same, just a headache. I have had them every day for 3+ years, they have gotten slightly worse but not by much. Imaging (CT, shunt series, etc.) all looks the same from the past 3 years. Seen 3 different neurosurgeons at UCLA. \n\nIt is extremely scary, I am pretty scared and maybe this thought is not logical since I have had the headaches for 3+ years, but every day I am scared the pressures just going to build up to some point one day and kill me, or cause coma, or something serious. If I COULD just live with the slit ventricles and treat them with migraine meds, I would since they are not horrible, but I have trouble understanding whether or not it can be simply \u201clived with\u201d since I do not and have not had any other symptoms for the 3+ years I have had headaches. Curious if anyone else has slit like ventricles, SVS, a similar story to mine, or treatment of slit ventricles with migraine therapy.  The worry and the stress of thinking I am going to just drop dead is 10 times worse than the actual headaches. Thank you. I have had slit ventricles since I was about 3 and I am now 28. Mine have not expanded at all in that time and I have had over 100 blocked shunts. I did get more than just headaches though. I would have nausea and fatigue in particular. Sometimes I did just have headaches which I would treat with pain meds. Without all the other symptoms I never assumed it was a pressure problem. Slit~like  vs slit ventricle. You would probably have slit ventricle syndrome now.  It is not easy to get them back to normal.  You would need an anti siphoning device. Do you usually get your headaches after standing up for a while? They usually do not change whether I am standing or laying, but they slightly improve at night when I am laying and going to bed. As of yesterday, im currently being suggested to try out migraine therapy for them, to see if that helps for the management, since the headaches themselves are not too interfering with my life. hopefully it brings improvement. Yea.  I hope you find relief. You should ask about  adding anti siphoning devices to your shunt or catheter. Thank you, will do Slit vents usually happen over time and they are difficult to fix unfortunately Do they have to be \u201cfixed\u201d or can they simply be managed thru certain pain therapies like migraine therapy? Pain and migraine therapy is not a solution. It might mask the headaches for a bit.  You need your vents to increase in size. Only way is to decrease the csf flow", "Shunt related headaches I am M24 and have had a shunt since birth. Many revisions, but the last one was when I was 14. Have not had any problems since. Yesterday I had a migraine that was so bad it was making me feel nauseous to the point that I did not eat dinner. Usually I would think nothing of it, but wanted to see what other people\u2019s shunt headaches felt like. This felt like a tension headache, almost like a band squeezing around the side of my head. How has anyone else felt it? I think mine my be weird because the occipital plate of my skull shattered during one of my brain surgeries, so the back of my skull is missing. But, with that in mind, here is what mine feel like.\n\nIt feels like my head is going to explode from the inside out. There is a pounding, throbbing feeling that grows from the inside of my skull, my ears have that sound you get when you place your ear next to a seashell ringing in them, and the back of my head literally inflates during very severe headaches.  Ok so definitely different than what I was feeling but you and I would most likely have different symptoms. Thanks anyway! My headaches start out with like tension headaches. A telltale sign for me is 'sunset eyes', where it can hurt to look directly upwards. Though given enough delay between headache and other symptoms, it can progress to nausea as well for me.\n\nGood luck! When my shunt got blocked the headaches were always 1) worse first thing in the morning 2) coupled with nausea 3) make me feel like I just want to curl up and sleep. Usually I would just log it (like actually make a physical note somewhere of the date and time of the headache) and monitor for a few days. If the log shows I have been having headaches regularly I called my surgeon. It is quite easy to explain away headaches when you do not want it to be anything brain related, eg. \u2018I was stressed at work\u2019, \u2018I did not get a good sleep\u2019, \u2018I did have one glass of wine last night perhaps it is a hangover?\u2019. But making a physical note of it reminds me that it is not actually normal to have a headache everyday. \n\nKeep an eye on yourself, and call your surgeon if it repeats! :) Thanks! I did write myself a note, as well as describe how it felt, so I could refer back to it later.   I hope it is nothing \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb I hope it is just a headache for you and not shunt failure. I am a male turning 30 next month and my last revision was back in October of last year and it was my 29th revision. My only symptom that I present with is just a headache that will not go away. The pain starts at my forehead and behind my eyes. If I wait to see if it is shunt failure, the pain gets worse and it feels like my eyes are about to pop out (not possible) of their sockets due to the pressure. Eventually the pain is too great and I force myself to go to the ER. I had those types of headaches awhile ago. When I went to my neurosurgeon he found that I had scar tissue wrapped around the tubing in my neck and belly. It was causing it to pull the part of the shunt that is in my head. I dunno if this is the case for you because after he said that, it was obvious because when I moved my head you could see my scar pull with it. My head is between a vice. If you still have it on Monday call your doctor. It is better to get checked out when nothing is wrong compared to letting it go on. That was the biggest mistake I made 10 years ago. My fear delayed the necessary surgery a month. The next morning it felt fine, so I am just keeping track of it I have the exact same thing! I am M16 and I have been having headaches 24/7 without relief for the past year or so (I have had maybe two or three weekends headache free). Literally 99% of my headaches are the exact same as what you described. Ok thanks for letting me know. I will have to take better care looking out for them. Have you talked to your neurosurgeon about them? They should know. Yeah, I have had multiple MRIs and surgeries but nothing has helped.", "Motor vehicle accident Hello new to sub.  I am 23m had vp programmable shunt placed when i was ten after passing out due to growth of a very large arachnoid cyst.  \n\nI have had a chiari malformation that was decompressed at 17 \n\nAnd a partial revision last year right at the start of covid before lockdowns. No issues full recovery back to normal. \n\nI was unfortunately rearended at a full stop from a larger vehicle than my own.

However the symptoms have not gone away and ive only seen pas on the matter. \n\nSymptoms im having are that of overdrainage now. Im wondering if the car accident is capable of tearing scar tissue around my decompression site allowing for more flow now after the accident. Im at a loss for why i feel bad.  I am having a cervical and lumbar mri done and wondering if this may be the case. I do not have anything to contribute but I hope you get relief/answers soon. Absolutely. I would contact your neurosurgeon or primary care physician immediately.", "Has anyone else had this happen with their shunt? My shunt is 21 years old and was placed when I was an infant. I have had no revisions and thankfully very few problems with it. My shunt is non-functioning and does not do anything.\n\nA year ago I went to see my neurosurgeon because the tubing was starting to calcify and bend. He did a few scans and determined that everything was fine. \n\nI have recently noticed that my shunt has bent in two more places, and that a part of the tubing in my neck has disappeared. I cannot feel that part of the tubing in my neck anymore and it is not visible. I am not too concerned about it, because my shunt does not work anymore, but I was just wondering if anyone else has had the same problem. I am wondering if it has broken or if it has moved a little bit. I do have pain in my neck sometimes, but it is mostly just annoying. \n\nI have visits every 1-2 years with my neurosurgeon, so I think I have another appointment coming up this summer, but I just wanted to ask here to see if any of you have had the same experience.", "Experience with ETV? Hi everyone! I am getting an ETV this week and I was just wondering what side effects occurred afterwards and people\u2019s overall experiences? Hi I had one 6 months ago. I made a post about it here\n\n\n\nBut I can answer any specific questions you might have about it as well I saw that, thank you! I was just wondering if re-learning to walk afterwards is typical, or specific to your case? It is not typical and the doctors were not able to figure out why it happened. If I had to guess the issues were due to balance. I was not paralyzed or anything like that and my legs were not weakened, I just had trouble staying stable on two legs. This is was my first and only brain surgery so the pressure in my head was really high so I think the pressure change did it I had an ETV 10 years ago and have had no complications.  Following the surgery, I stayed in the hospital two days. The next week was pretty rough, with intense headaches, nausea, and tiredness.  I did not have other side effects. By three weeks after the surgery, I was able to fly across the country and return to college. I dealt with chronic headaches following the surgery for over a year (this was the symptom that led to my diagnosis). They gradually improved and are no longer an issue for me. I had mine 4 years ago. Had mild-severe adjustment headaches for about a year after. Still get headaches with changes in atmospheric pressure or stress. Had some memory issues after but nothing disturbingly different. \n\nYou will be fine. God speed with recovery! Same,  I had one 3 months ago and everything has slowly fell into place for me thankfully, some headaches, especially if exercising which is normal they said.  Best thing to do is to stay positive and listen to your body.  Best of luck! Got one 10 years ago. Zero complications or revisions.", "Sleep in a tilt? Hey guys. My 8mo baby had a VP shunt surgery a week ago and the doctor told us that she should sleep in a 30 degrees angle for a better CSF flow. For how long should she sleep like that? Did you also had to sleep in a tilt when you got your shunt too?", "Hydrocephalus in Haiti- we need help  \n\n\n\n\n\nHydrocephalus is a condition in which excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up within the fluid-containing cavities or ventricles of the brain. The term hydrocephalus is derived from the Greek words \"hydro\" meaning water and \"cephalus\" meaning the head. Although it translates as \"water on the brain,\" the word actually refers to the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid, a clear organic liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. CSF is in constant circulation within the ventricles of the brain and serves many crucial functions: 1) it acts as a \"shock absorber\" for the brain and spinal cord; 2) it acts as a vehicle for delivering nutrients to the brain and removing waste from it; and 3) it flows between the cranium and spine to regulate changes in pressure.\n\nWhen CSF builds up around the brain, it can create harmful pressures on the tissues of the brain confined within the skull. The accumulation of CSF occurs due to either an increase in production of the fluid, a decrease in its rate of absorption or from a condition that blocks its normal flow through the ventricular system.\n\nHydrocephalus can occur at any age, but is most common in infants and adults age 60 and older. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), hydrocephalus is believed to affect approximately one to two in every 1,000 children born in the U.S. The majority of these cases are often diagnosed before birth, at the time of delivery or in early childhood.\n\nHaiti is the poorest country in our part of the world and with a population of about 10 million people, it does not have *any* trained pediatric neurosurgeons. As individuals affected by hydrocephalus, whether having it ourselves or having a loved one who has it, we know all too well what this means for the children there with hydrocephalus. These kids went untreated and suffered the debilitating, and sometimes deadly, results of this condition. The majority of children with hydrocephalus in Haiti were male (54.8%, n = 197), born in the rainy season (59.7%, n = 233), and born in a coastal/inland location (43.3%, n = 61). The most common surgical intervention was endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) (45.7%, n = 175).\n\nhelp use save these kids cos every children count by your donation do it on:\n\nvenmo: +1786228486\n\npaypal: \n\nzelle: +17866228486 You should start a gofundme instead of using what looks like a personal zelle/Venmo account. Yeah. I am ready to send money but not to some random dude. I will look for a hospital or whatever. If you are scamming...shame, shame, shame on you. I am giving you the \"mom\" look...

My Neuro just gave me Compisine for me to take on an as-needed basis for headaches. For anyone who has taken it, do you find it to be effective? Anything I should be careful of? I have never taken it for headaches, but I do know someone that takes it and says it works fine for him. Not only that but Compazine is used largely for nausea as well.\n\nI do not think you need to worry about Compazine too much, just take as directed What is the limit to this per day? It should be taken every 6 to 8 hours each day. It can be taken with/without food.\nU should also jot down the foods you eat while noticing nausea etc. Sometimes ppl do not realize that there might be a food that U are consuming that makes you nauseous without realizing it. \n    While keeping a food diary for a few days I noticed that is certain foods bother me more than others, so I avoid those foods altogether and/or try introducing the foods back into your diet after a few weeks, etc. Everytime that I have had to go to the E.R.  for migraine/pressure relief, they would give me a benadryl/compazine cocktail. I hated it. It made me feel so drowsy, but without being able to go to sleep. As an everyday solution for headaches, I would be miserable. There is no way I would take it. I would refuse.", "First shunt, 2 1/2 wks post-op hair cut indecision. TLDR if you are a woman or had long hair before your surgery, what hairstyle did you go with post op? Did you shave your whole head?\n\nI am 2 1/2 weeks post op, my stitches are out, and I still do not know if I should shave the rest of my hair off or not. I have struggled with caring properly for my long, frizzy, wavy curly hair my whole life, but despite that my hair was important to me bc of my culture and the fact that it was a barrier between me and the world. And then I had surgery last year for a cyst removal where a large portion of the hair on the back of my head was shaved. Ever since then I have had massive self esteem problems related to hair, despite the fact that I was able to hide it the surgery site with ponytails until my new hair grew in. When the new growth was 3 1/2 inches long I cut the rest of my hair to match the length, but longer on the top for a feminine kind of look. I got used to having short hair for the first time in my life, and the look was starting to grow on me, but I did not get the chance to learn to love it.\n\nNow, on the right half of my head I have the hair shaved back about 4 inches, going down in a curved manner all the way to the right side of the nape of my neck. The shunt device is an inch back from my hairline above my right eyebrow and is very visible. The incision is also still pretty thick and raised. I fear if I shave my hair and go without a head covering that it will be super obvious and get me stares. I am really self conscious even around my family. Right now when I leave the house (very little trips out in public, but I have to walk my dog every day) I have been wearing a hat or a scarf sometimes, but the scarf does not stay on very well. It would be easier for overall hair care and growth to shave my head but I still have reservations. I just feel so low about how I look now, and I do not know how long it will take for the hair to grow enough to hide the large lump the device makes. I hate wearing hats and scarves too, but wigs are not an option because of sensory issues. \n\nI do not really know what to do and would love to hear what others decided to do with their hair, if you all went out the house with your head uncovered before your hair hid the shunt device or not, how long it took for your hair to grow in over the device, etc. I just got my hairdresser to tidy up the shaved side and redo my layers (since I had to shift my side parting to the opposite side) as soon as I could after the stitches were out. Then I maintained it with the shaved side being about an inch and a half long to cover my scars (coloured it dark purple while I was at uni, then when I graduated switched to black with dark brown highlights - I am naturally dark blonde). I have quite thick hair (hence I had layers to start off with) that grows about an inch every six weeks, so I am lucky in that sense.\n\nWhen I felt ready, I let the shaved side grow a bit more before cutting the other side so I had something like a pixie cut, then grew it gradually over the next two years to shoulder height. \n\nI really miss my half-and-half hair sometimes because it meant half the time styling! I got lots of compliments on it. When I tied up the long side, people did not notice the other side was short unless it was pointed out. \nDo not worry about your hair/look.  Embrace the scar, after some time, you will not be bothered by it. and I thought *my* hair grew fast at half an inch a month, lol!\nWas your hair exactly half and half, or was your longer hair over the halfway mark a bit? I see some interesting looking 1/4ths, and 2/5ths shaved hairstyles when I do a search that are giving me ideas. I am bad with words rn but it is like the longer hair is more over the side than directly in the middle.\n\nWas your shunt one of the more noticeable types? Mine is like a large goose egg and idk how to cope with how large and odd it looks to me. How long would you say it took for your shunt to be hidden? Evening out your hair into a pixie cut when it is long enough is a good idea, I am thinking I may do the same. I understand what you mean and where you are probably coming from, but hair is v important in my culture and to me personally as a woman who had long hair their whole life, so it is been hard to cope with this huge change. It is at the same level as learning to deal with the fact that I need an implanted medical device, which can fail or become infected, to survive. And my shunt is quite noticeable on my temple. I am sure I will get used to it over time but I do not want to keep looking like someone pulled a prank on me in my sleep with hair clippers, you know? But I do not know if I want to shave it all off either. I think 2/5 short, and the rest was layered from mid-ear down to just below shoulder length. Look up how Natalie Dormer used to have her hair - the parting was a bit further toward the middle than hers. I would use curling tongs to make it wavy and give it more volume for extra contrast :)\n\nI cannot think of something to compare the size of my valve bump to. I think it is about 1cm tops raised from my skull.\n\nYou probably notice yours way more than others do! That is what people kept saying to me while I was waiting for my hair to grow enough to cover it. I get it.  And I bet seeing my pictures are not entirely helpful since I am a male.  \n\nI wish you nothing but love and strength. Nobody except you knows how much you went through. I had my surgery back in 2019 and they shaved in two places, the top of my head above my right eyebrow and near my hairline but also behind my right ear. I did not mind so much that people would see the wounds/staples but it did not heal properly and now I have some unfortunate spots where the hair has not grown back. \n\nI changed my hairline slightly to cover the area, and told myself that when my hair behind my ear reaches my shoulders, I will cut my hair to match it. However, it is now passing my shoulders and the rest of my hair is at the bottom of my back!!! \n\nI like my shorter piece of hair. I cannot see my scars on my head so having the slightly shorter piece is my little reminder... though with the shorter hair on top I am thinking of cutting into bangs very shortly once the non-essential shops are open again. I am thinking of having it cut like the Korean hairstyles with the super thin fringes and flowy layering. I find that it looks so beautiful and stylish! Hi!  I understand how you feel.  I was wearing a partial wig on my first day of junior high school in 1979.  I just had a full shunt replacement in December at age fifty-three. The original shunt was on the right.  The new one is on the left &amp; really protrudes  Most of the hair on the right side of my head&amp; half-way around the back was shaved.  Going for my first haircut next week! Personally, I feel better doing something fun with the hair I have rather than shaving it. Good luck &amp; take care. Every piece of input is helpful, I appreciate hearing from everyone! Your words did have an impact on me, I enjoyed the post you linked. It furthered along the thought process of me beginning to accept how my shunt changes my looks. I ended up shaving all my hair off a few days ago, as I realize I hate dealing with hair that is uneven in such a big way. Sorry for the late response, I am in tx dealt with utility outages and service is still spotty that sounds like a really unique and pretty style! I love the idea of having the shorter section as a reminder of your experiences and quite literally your growth. I already ended up shaving my hair a few days ago but will keep this cute idea in mind for if I have to ever have another brain surgery. Something fun if you are open to it could be experimenting with dye. I was considering dyeing mine pink or something. I ended up shaving my hair a few days after making this post, because I realized I cannot stand having uneven hair, but depending on how the hair over my shunt grows back in I may still experiment with dye... Was considering trying a wig as well. It must have been pretty hard to adjust to that in high school. Hopefully your new shunt is working well and you find a fun way of expressing yourself through your new hairstyle! That is about how big my shunt is as well, I feel pretty hyperaware of it. It is the first thing my eyes are drawn to in the mirror. \n\nThat is a really cute hairstyle (that you referenced) and my hair sounds like it was shaved in almost the same spot as yours. I do not think I could pull off a look like that, I consider it more bold for me than a shaved head. So a few days ago I shaved mine. Also did it bc I realize the first brain surgery I had made me realize I hate having my hair so uneven. \nSorry abt the late reply, I have not had utilities and my service has been spotty bc of the weather that passed thru tx.    That is great you are open to trying new things.  I used colorful scarves when I was in school.  Today they would have to sell matching scarves &amp; masks!   My big \"hair day\" is this Thursday.  I use highlights to bring out the natural red in my dark hair.  Fortunately, not many grays yet!  I am still getting used to the way this new shunt protrudes.  I hope your new shunt works well for you &amp; that you find a fun new hairstyle/color. I am so happy for you.  \n\nEnjoy living without the burden of obsessing what your hair is doing: how it looks, and if it is covering your scar.  \n\nStay in touch.", "Shunts keep getting blocked, what do I do? I had surgery in oct 2019 for a revision, it had been blocked for a couple years (I only get minor headaches when it is blocked), it blocked only 2 weeks after getting it revised. I had it revised again last month, this time, they moved it to the front top of my head, and added an anti siphoning device. Again, I feel the familiar headaches, and I am 99% sure it is blocked. Has anyone else dealt with continuous blockages? I am a candidate for ETV but my ventricles dont always get bigger during a failure so I am not always a candidate (they are small at the moment). \nTo anyone who dealt with this, I know everyone is different, but what ended up working for you?? I have had about 200 shunt revisions over about 26 years. Some years I has none, some years I had 15. It was almost always the poximal catheter or valve that blocked. I am not a candidate for an ETV because I have slit ventricles and they have never expanded. We would do ophthalmology to look for pressure on the optic nerves to check if it was blocked.\n\nIt was then decided I was having too many revisions and shunts were not working for me. So I had stents placed in a few veins in my brain about a year and a half ago. These opened up the veins so that CSF could diffuse in and be reabsorbed that way. I have not had to have any further surgery since this other than venograms to check its work. This was performed by interventional radiologists who I was referred to by my neurosurgeon.\n\nIf you are not super unwell when your shunt is blocked, you may be able to take something like diamox which reduced the CSF production and that could be your treatment instead of a shunt.", "Shunt adjustments do not do anything for headaches Hi guys. I have hydrocephalus and chiari malformation  (lucky me). Anyways I had a decompression done in 2010 and right after that they put my vp shunt in for the hydrocephalus. All of my other symptoms disappeared except for my headaches. No matter what the adjustment to my shunt is I still have the constant headache. Wake up with it go to bed with it. It is extremely upsetting as some days I cannot even move my head without a severe pain bringing me back to reality. Was wondering if anyone else has had this issue or anything similar...???? Sorry to hear about your constant headaches. I too have hydrocephalus and constant headaches. I also have a porencephalic cyst that has caused issues. I certainly do not mean to be discouraging, but tomorrow is the 31st anniversary of my headaches starting. If you are interested in talking with someone else who knows what it is like to have a long term constant headache, please hit me up.   Thank you.  Hey, just wanted to say that I also have hydro and a near-permanent headache, regardless of my shunt.  It gets really frustrating. Right! Have they put you on any medication that helps with them? Imitrex did for a bit, but my body adjusted and then it did not. \ud83d\ude16  Mind if I ask you somewhat personal questions? I have absolutely no one to talk to about this who understands just how miserable my days are. How old are you and how long have you had the shunt? Have you had any revisions? You can message me if you are more comfortable that way. I messaged you.  I will answer any other questions you have, just message me back. :)", "Malfunction Symptoms? 48F, i have had a shunt since I was 28 days old. In 2017 I had it replaced.\nI had been experiencing symptoms of malfunction for years but it was never diagnosed because we had been told my shunt was not needed and that I had outgrown my condition when I was a young child.\n\nEverything has been fine since 2017 when I had my surgery. However, I have late, I have had a dull headache for four days or so, feel slight lightheadedness, and my right shoulder, which is the side that my shunt is on, is sore.\n\nMy neurosurgeon has ordered an updated MRI, but I will not be getting that until January 18.\n\nMy question for you is this: \nIn the meantime, how do I best manage these symptoms? Has anyone gone through this and gotten relief using Tylenol and what else did you do to lessen the symptoms until you could see your neurologist?\n(I have a Coffman Certas Plus set on 5.)\n\nTIA.", "Shrooms So,\n\nI took magic mushrooms twice with friends a few years ago. About a year ago, I had surgery to remove a benign brain tumor, and later VP shunt surgery for hydracephalus. Would it be safe to do shrooms again now? Would a small amount be okay? Do not want to overdue anything. Sure \nI have done them plenty\nI stay away from acid just because I have heard about acid interacting with csf, and I do not want that to interact with the shunt \nBut mushrooms are okay. Maybe micro dose a little before taking a monster amount just for good measure", "Programmable VP Shunt Hi everyone I have Spina Bifida and hydrocephalus and I recently got a new shunt that is programmable. My question is does any one else experience clicking or movement in their head? I feel it every once in a while and it creeps me out Yes. My wife has a shunt and hears it all the time. That is messed up lol. I got a programmable shunt as well. Put to the highest setting apparently but never hear anything Yes! I have a programmable VP shunt for hydrocephalus. My first ever revision at age 28 and every now and again I hear clicking and buzzing. I spoke to my neurologist and he that this is normal and just movement of fluid through the valves or movement of fluid due to gravity. But it is definitely disconcerting! Hey, thanks for sharing.\nMy partner and I had no idea programable shunts were a thing.\nWe will make enquires with her neurologist over the next few days as most times her shunt, if it is having issues is blocked or not draining enough and this time it is taking too much.\nRather than surgery every 18-24 months this sounds much less invasive.", "Is the ETV a very dangerous procedure? Have one coming up and really nervous I have had shunt revisions only, and I understand the chance of dying in a shunt surgery is virtually 0, the risks are there but very low. With how invasive the ETV is, and from some horror stories I have read, I am worried as hell. Having it done at a good hospital and my success score is 80%... but a 1% chance of dying, or waking up with a lifelong mental issue like lose of memory is giving me insane worry. I had an ETV done for obstructive hydrocephalus in July 2019. \n\nWas in hospital for 5 days, recovery was not too bad, was back at work after about a month. \n\nI was 30 when I had it done and the holes remain open and I do not have ICP any more. I understand that this means it will likely stay open forever now.\n\nSo all in all, a positive experience for me. \n\nI had this done in Brisbane, Australia. \n\nHappy to answer any questions? I also have one, have had it for 1.5 years and no issue. Performed in Canada. I really have not heard the horror stories of ETVs and I am not sure where they come from, my neurosurgeon and neurologist were very keen on its success and it beats having shunt after shunt (I have burned through 7). Also happy to answer questions. My daughter had an ETV. The recovery was longer than we expected intellectually, but it did happen. A big part of that might have been from how closely together her shunt placement and ETV happened. Be gentle with yourself. It is a safe surgery. You said yourself, you are having it done at a good hospital. It is normal to be nervous... but you are going to be fine. Better than fine, because of how much this will help you. Hugs, ET. Did you have a shunt before, or was ETV the first treatment? Same here, had only shunts my whole life. Most have lasted years but I have had 3 shunts in the past 14 months because they keep getting partially blocked. Hoping the ETV fixes that. Did you find recovery to be easier or the same as shunt revisions? My revisions have always gone super smooth, I have woken up feeling great and home the next day. Thank you very much. First treatment. Recovery was fine. Was out of hospital in 5 days (mostly because it was partially over a weekend) and felt fine after, just like any shunt revision. I had some weird brain zap things for around 6 months after, but they have all subsided. There may have also been some endocrine abnormalities, with weird sweating patterns and such, though I personally cannot be sure if it was that or in my head. I had an ETV and while mine was not successful, I found it a lot easier to go through than shunt surgery. I feel like shunt surgery is a hell of a lot more invasive than having an ETV and therefore is waaaayyyyy more painful. \n\nI was discharged 2 days after surgery (would have been the next day but I got a temperature) and I started feeling like myself again about 5 days after having my ETV. In terms of the risks, I completely understand where you are coming from. Unfortunately it is just one of those things that come along with treatment for our condition. From conversations with my Neurosurgeon and from what I have read, they are generally safe. I also like the idea of there not being a foreign object in your body if they are successful. Hopefully yours is successful! Wishing you the best of luck. Hey I am also from Canada and my mother is having her first neurosurgery appt for NPH this week at st. Mikes in Toronto. Do you happen to be in Ontario? \n\nI am also interested in learning more about etv vs shunt, and the pros and cons of each for an older adult. Any thoughts or direction on this would be amazing. No, NL. I do have a family friend with NPH that was treated by shunt, and I do not think that ETV is all that common in NPH patients though I could be wrong. I have had each though and recovery is similar, though in NPH I think recovery is generally a tad trickier, though far from impossible. I personally like the ETV, but it all depends on the patient pathology, and her neurologist/neurosurgeon will know that best. They work in teams on this so they will certainly drum up the best solution. I would not be too concerned if they suggested one or the other, I know people who have had shunts for 30+ years with no issue and have heard of others going longer. Ok this is very helpful. All the best and thank you", "VP Shunt Recovery I am an avid gym-goer. I love to lift weights, I love dieting, I love scheduling, cooking, etc. This summer, I began to have seizures, it was discovered that I had a strange occurrence of epilepsy. Since then I have had two more. So recently I was rushed to the hospital for the last seizure, I then had a VP shunt procedure done. I was told that the shunt and the seizure were not related to one another, and I have hydrocephalus which is also not related to the seizures, so I guess what I am wondering is should I keep it? Also how long after getting a VP shunt until I can safely lift weights again? or get back to my normal routine period? I do not want to change my routine for something that I am told was a waste of energy, to begin with.", "Trying to understand MRI...unsure of condition? Hi! I already am diagnosed with gray matter heterotopia which causes seizures. I luckily have only had 2 seizures in my life--one at 15 and one a few months ago at 23 which I had to get a new MRI for since I was off meds at that point. I had heard new research that suggests covid affects gray matter so I pulled up my recent MRI to have a look and see if that had or would affect me.\n\nI saw that in the MRI that I have pineal cysts and mild aqueductal stenosis that has caused \"ventral displacement of the tectum\" but NO evidence of acute hydrocephalus. However, this appears to suggest some sort of hydrocephalus. I do not expect anyone to be a doctor hahaha but I was never even told that I had any of these other brain abnormalities. I do not have any symptoms that suggest this, but I have always had difficulty moving eyes/eye pressure that I thought was related to my (also horrible) sinuses. The addendum basically only said that these issues were incidental and nothing else.\n\nLooking to see if anyone also has pineal cysts/aqueductal stenosis. Is it just not a big deal to certain doctors if those conditions are causing basically no symptoms? Would you bring this up to your own doctor if this was you? How has it affected your life? Should I expect anything later in life? Thank you all in advance &lt;3 Non of those structures are made of gray matter tissue. The abnormalities, if they have not been addressed probably are not remarkable enough to diagnose. An aqueductal stenosis for instance is just a narrowing of a portion of the third ventricle. It can be narrower than average person and you still may not present with hydrocephalus. I am not sure if you are reading the MRI or reading the notes of your imaging, but you may be reading too far into it. Everything gets documented even if it is not relevant or prominent enough to diagnose as an abnormality, disease or condition. Intraocular pressure, eye pressure from inside, should not be tightly bound to your nasal sinuses. It is a pretty simple thing to have checked though and if you are experiencing eye pressure you should definitely have that checked. It is one of those symptoms that is good to catch early and in indicator for developing something like glaucoma. Oh, I know that the gray matter thing does not relate. Just a super long backstory lol. I had some other abnormalities that they also have not brought up so I guess they just do not think it is enough to affect me. I am a writer, not a science person, so it just kind of struck me that they would not immediately tell me anything abnormal that goes on in my brain but it is good to hear that it could just be there and not too big of an issue! \n\nI have always had vision issues and eye pressure and where I have other brain abnormalities may affect my eye area so I will definitely get that checked out. I have a habit of ignoring some health issues and learning to live with them because so many people have just said it is allergies/sinuses. \n\nThanks for helping calm my overactive nerves! No problem! We are all very different machines! I would bring it up with your doctor if you have a chance and just ask if you are curious about all the brain stuff. Definitely bring up the eye thing because it is an easy supposedly painless and routine test. I have had some incidental findings on my scans as well that no one seems to think is an issue. My pineal tumor with cyst was one of those written off by neurologists in the past. Mine was symptomatic and caused me a lot of issues and eventually after being dismissed so many times I requested to see a neurosurgeon who worked mostly with pineal cysts and he agreed it was pretty detrimental, then he removed it. I am still not sure if the mass caused my hydrocephalus or if it was a complication of the pinealectomy, or both. I think it was both. According to the surgeon, pineal cyst/tumor symptoms are quite similar to hydrocephalus at it is extreme, and pineal masses can obstruct csf bc of where it is located in the brain. I also had struggled with moving my eyes and pain behind them due to the cyst, and had severe issues with sleep and extreme headaches. I am doing better now but still having issues because of my shunt. The other incidental findings I am not exploring, even though I have family history that implies it could be more than a simple anomaly, because it is so hard for me to deal with medical things now. It is taxing to get doctors to listen to me. \n\nMy best advice is that if it is concerning you, if your symptoms and progression matches with a symptomatic pineal cyst, and/or to hydrocephalus, to bring it up with a doctor you trust. They should do tests and work to rule it out or any other similar neurologic conditions. You do not have to be acutely or severely effected to be effected, if you know what I mean... If it impacts you you have every right to explore answers and treatment. Do not accept anyone writing you off because it was an incidental finding. My neurosurgeon who did my pinealectomy reassured me he is very much used to patients being written off because of that, and getting worse because of a lack of treatment which happened to me. At the least, they can have you do a series of scans every year or few years to monitor the cyst growth and make sure your not becoming symptomatic.", "Anyone with the Codman Certas plus valve have high pressure issues ?

My daughter with hydrocephalus gets headaches too. I have a trick that helps me sleep. I put icy hot balm on my forehead, back of my neck,  and right behind my ears at the jaw muscle. Once the icy hot wears off, I take a hot shower and re-engage the icy hot. Then I can fall asleep at least for a few hours. That Is awesome,  thanks!

We just moved to Amsterdam and I had a feeling no one knew anything about shunts or hydrocephalus. I asked them if they had plans to reset the settings after but they looked clueless and said no. I insisted so they took an xray and after an hour of wasting my time, they said we can go home and everything looks good but considering the doctor's and nurses had never treated a baby with hydrocephalus makes me worried. Should it not have been reset? What should I be looking out for in my baby? Thanks The doctors do suggest getting it checked after an MRI but in my experience it has never needed adjusting. I had a programmable go shunt put in in October of 2018 and had it removed in March of this year. Every time I had an mri my ns had to change my setting every time. In my experience it changed so much that I developed low pressure hydrocephalus. But that is just my experience. If your child seems to do fine and does not have any problems, then theirs might have stayed the same pressure and they will be okay I gave a programmable shunt my MRI tech called me and said he was not going to do the MRI until I had an appointment with my surgeon within a 24 hour period after the scan Our 22 month old son has had a VP shunt since he was 1 month old.  He ALWAYS gets it reset after an MRI.  While it might be ok, our NS said that the magnets can mess up the shunt and it is always better safe than sorry.  I would maybe call around and see if there is a better pediatric neurosurgon who can reset it. MRI certainly can change the shunt setting. An x-ray will confirm the level. No need for a resetting. You should have a neurosurgeon on call and get his opinion when matters like this arises. GPs do not specialise in the area. If the magnets in an iPad can reset a programmable shunt, I am pretty sure an MRI could do the same. I would get it checked out. The techs who do the scans usually do not really know what they are scanning, just how to operate the machinery. Find a neurosurgeon who knows what they are doing and ask them. \nAlso, if it was a CT scan, there should not be a problem because that uses X-rays. You used both terms in your post, so I do not know if your child got an MRI or a scan with radiation. If you got one with X-rays, they would not need to check the shunt because there are not magnets, but MRIs have them. He got an mri scan but an X-ray after the mri", "Over ear headphones hurt side of head Hi I find that using over ear or on ear headphones tends to hurt the side of my head where my shunt is. As such I cannot use any gaming headsets. Does anyone else have this problem? And could anyone recommend some high quality gaming earphones. At the moment I am using apple EarPods and they do not always work properly. I have been advised not to used any types of those larger, over the ear headsets, as they might contain magnets strong enough to reset the shunt. It is never happened to me, but I do not use those types of headsets.  \n\nI use AirPods myself, but I just got them not too long ago so they are at peak performance. \n\nHang tough Hi thanks for the reply, I have never heard of the headsets containing magnets that affect shunts. Yeah I also have a pair of AirPods sadly they are not compatible with PS4. It is a shame that there is no standard gaming earphones, at least not that I know of. Sennheiser wired earbuds are highly regarded. I watch an Apex Legends streamer who uses them exclusively. I had the same issue, but then I read a review for these headphones:(\n\nthat noted they were comfortable for larger heads.  I bought a set a couple years ago, have never had any issues with them and they are by far the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever owned.  The sound quality is fantastic. I the pair I use is the Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II and they do not seem to bother my shunt (though I cannot wear them for a really long time because of headaches). \n\nThey are not cheap, so you might try to find a pair to try on at a store like Best Buy just to see how they work for you. i do not have a recommendation unfortunately but i have this same issue, especially with glasses. commenting so if someone is reading maybe they have a good tip as to help with the glasses pain! Had the same issue ! I found that Corsair works perfectly. The padding is enough to add comfort but not add more pressure to the shunt. I have personally worn them all day with no problems Did you YouTube how to connect AirPods to ps4 I believe it is possible As far as I know it is not possible without an adapter.  Thanks I will try that out. That will be good if it works on remote play as that frees up the USB port. Thanks for all the replies. Unfortunately I do not think I will be able to use any on ear or over the ear headphones as the weight of them presses on my shunt and cause me pain. I think I am going to try and get my AirPods to work with my PS4. That way both my USB ports are free for other devices.", "Wife\u2019s VP shunt continues to get \u2018debris\u2019 Hey all.\nMy wife\u2019s been having a tough run lately.\n\nHer vp shunt has blocked with \u2018debris\u2019 5 times in the last year.\n\n2 years prior it did almost the same thing resulting in multiple surgeries.\n\nShe is 33 and has had 31 shunt revisions.\n\nAnyone else had issues with repeatedly blocked shunts due to \u2018debris\u2019 assuming its concealed fluid? \n\nWhat was the resolution or information you were provided that is provided any relief? The placement of the shunt goes a long way. Have you asked them about the placement and their research into it. There is some study about it. My son had many problem with his programmable shunt until I sent him out of state to a completely new doctor. That doctor gave him a Sophysa shunt. They are not very popular here but are in Europe.\n\nIt did the trick. He has not been hospitalized since after about five years of hell.\n\nTry a different doc with a different approach? A completely different shunt? Good luck. I know it sucks. Yep, they are considering changing which side of the neck it runs down. \n\nIt is possible the scar tissue from previous surgeries is too restrictive on the tubing and exacerbating it. Preventing it from flowing freely. One of few theories at the moment. So sorry to hear that she is going through this. I had a period of time where I had to have 8 shunt revisions within a years time due to debris blocking the shunt. I just turned 30 and have finally fully recovered from my 31st shunt revision. Sadly, there really is not anything that can be done to improve her chances of the shunt not failing. Reading over all of my doctors notations in my medical record, he did state at one time that he was going to try and move the position of the shunt from the back to the front of the ventricle to hopefully reduce the chances of it failing.

I do not know the qualifications but after the second failure my neurosurgeon did an ETV procedure and I have not had any problems since (now 35). Not sure how common of a procedure it is for neurosurgeons, I had mine done at Norton's in Louisville, KY by Dr. Raque if you are interested in another opinion. Did they fully remove your shut at the time of the procedure? How did it go? Hopefully you and her are doing better in the month or so since the procedure. Physio gave a few days of relief but the pains come back.\n\nShe is currently booked in for a planned surgery to move the tube placement so it is not between scar tissue. \nThey hope that will get rid of the pains and reduce chance of the tubing being constricted which could be a cause of the fluid congealing and blocking the valve. Seems your second edit was not as long ago as I thought. It really does suck how much of medical treatment is just trial and error. Hopefully this trial is a success and best of luck with the upcoming operation, whenever it may be. They did, at least I hope they did \ud83d\ude01 Did you happen to ask about ETV? Not yet, we have not been back in person since the plans for the upcoming surgery to speak to them.\n\nForced to quarantine because of a potential covid exposure so we had to lock down and keep getting tested so she is be guaranteed clear of it prior to surgery.\n\nNot sure how we would go with that but we can ask, she was born without one of her ventricles which makes the HC more troublesome. I was never given much information on that procedure to be honest, but being born without one of the ventricles seems like it might require a different plan altogether. I really hope they can figure something out in her case soon though. Thanks for keeping in touch all.\nMy wife has had the follow up procedure to move the tubing out of scarred tissue territory which had immediately removed the chronic neck pains.\n\nIt will take time for her to fully recover to ensure all pains have cleared and more-so to see how much relief this gives her in terms of reducing blockages. \n\nFingers crossed,m and thanks for all your feedback.", "Working and Disability I am about to run out of FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) time for my job.

The device provides continuous cerebrospinal fluid flow from the ventricles of the brain into the right atrium of the heart or peritoneal cavity.  The design allows the health care provider to non-invasively adjust the valve pressure with a magnetic tool.\nReason for Recall\n\nMedtronic is recalling the StrataMR Adjustable Valves and Shunts due to a design problem which may cause the valve opening pressures to be higher than specified and increase the resistance to the cerebrospinal fluid flow. If this occurs, there is the potential for under-drainage of fluid. Underdrainage occurs when the cerebral spinal fluid is not removed quickly, fluid builds up in the brain cavity and the symptoms of hydrocephalus recur.

Would we be notified by the Neuro if we have this shunt? My daughter got a new shunt in 2015, and I have no idea the brand; although, I do know it is adjustable. I stumbled across this recall by googling Hydrocephalus and chronic pain together. I would contact the Neuro's office and ask them what shunt your daughter has. Also there are Shunt medical cards that either you or your child can carry just in case, I got mine from Medtronic. I wish you and your family all the best.    ", "Is it possible for a VP shunt to last forever? I have had a hydrocephalus from birth due to a very very very rare birth defect where I have absolutely zero cilia (hairs that absorb spinal fluid) in my head. I have had a VP shunt since I was 6 months old, I am now 16 and have never had revisions or issues. Is it possible the shunt could last my entire life with no need for a revision? Iv had mine since i was 9, Im 28 now and i have never had a revision. there are some people that just get lucky with shunts. About the worst thing that happened with mine was the tubing in my neck shifted a bit when i slept in a weird position. It was extremely painful but eventually it settled back in place. \n\nHave you ever had anything go slightly wrong with yours yet? No, nothings ever gone wrong. My one ventricle was larger a couple years ago but they did not do anything, this year they both were the same size. I am also short so there is lots of tubing still in my abdominal cavity Over the last year I have been having some medical mystery symptoms, (vomiting completely randomly like mid convos, headaches everyday but not horrible) and had an MRI a couple months ago and they said everything was working fine so they think it is unrelated. I am about 12 years past my last revision, so I am crossing my fingers I can keep this going. There is no expiration date of a shunt that I have ever heard of. My child\u2019s was actually implanted with extra tubing in preparation for her growth when she got it as an infant. Anatomy note: Cilia do not absorb. They are small projections of a cell that help aid in movement of fluids such as csf or mucus. CSF is absorbed back into the veinous system through arachnoid villi. Anatomy has ton of similar sounding and looking words with completely different meanings (Eg peritoneum and perineum) Well from reading others experiences and having my own, usually when you go a long time without problems you may have few if any revisions in the future. Some people unfortunately have multiple revisions a year. I can only hope yours and mine will last forever. Btw im nowhere near the most knowledgeable person here so just take what i say with a grain of salt. Im sure someone will chime in here soon I had the same thing happen when i was around that age. I went to the doctors and had mri's and ct scans done just to make sure and everything was fine. In hindsight i think it was just being a teenager. Keeping up with friends, keeping up with school, staying up late, puberty. All while having hydrocephalus. It was a pretty stressful time for me at least. Now that im 28 i could not imagine doing the things i used to do Yeah cannot relate I already graduated and never leave the house lmao. I also definitely do not think throwing up everyday randomly for a year is normal but ya know to each their own experience They do theoretically last forever, but like any hardware, there are points of failure that can occur. I am 31 and have had 6 revisions, and they seem to have settled into happening once every 6-7 years (with the most recent being this year). I have had my VP shunt break in multiple ways and for multiple reasons, unfortunately. But some people just get really lucky and do not have that experience at all! \n\nAs long as you are not noticing really bad (unbearable) headaches and all the other symptoms of hydrocephalus issues, I am sure you will be good to go for a while. :) I did not realize you were throwing up on a day to day basis. That Is on a completely different level. I would see a Gastroenterologists to rule out any digestive issues.  Ive heard of people in their 60s that have had no issues with theirs, im 35 and so far so good. It is possible, major part is how you look after yourself, make sure that you sleep at regular hours, dont stay out on the sun without any head cover and dont stress - these are the things doctor told me when i was discharged and had my shunt replaced once at age of 6 now i am 27 - in 21 years i had to have only tube replaced as it was simply too short but shunt itself is all good Mines lasted 35 years with only 1 unrelated complication, but never had a revision No. Nothing lasts forever. I am 29 and had the same VP shunt since I was born, no problems 27 in two weeks with one revision at 2 weeks old\u2026 Mine still works perfect after 13 years since placed. Revision was bc cath got block by brain shifting over time.", "Supporting Someone with Hydrocephaly So glad I found this community! \nMy little sister got diagnosed with hydrocephaly a little over a year ago at the age of 15 and has since gotten two shunt surgeries. Her neurosurgeon is amazing and she is finally starting to feel \u201cnormal\u201d again which we all could not be more thrilled about, however, I feel that there are some ways in which I could better support her as a sister. \nDo you all have any advice on how to handle her frustration with this illness? Her reading skills and short term memory issues are still understandably frustrating her, as well as the overall fact that she cannot just be a \u201cnormal\u201d teenager, and when she talks to me about them I want to be as supportive as possible. \n\nTLDR; How would you want a family member to respond when you vent about your hydrocephaly frustrations to them? \n I have nearly 2 year old with hydrocephalus and when she was diagnosed I naturally did lots of research. I was happy to learn a few things. One was that I actually knew a person with it and it just never came up. She lived a regular life. I also learned that there are almost no limitations for my child. She does not need to be bubble wrapped or held out of certain activities. Whenever we travel I make sure I know where emergency neurosurgeons are located. Symptomatically all people are different. I would respect her complaints about head aches. They are a common complaint. She is probably going to be treated like a wounded puppy for a while, so respect her physical needs, but treat her like a normal person.  I was 12 when diagnosed, so the timeframe is similar.  I also had two revisions at 19.  I would say I appreciated having people there when I needed to vent frustration, most of which was similarly because I did feel like I could not quite get back to things I had previously done, not that I was severely restricted, but because I could not quite catch up socially and academically with the other kids.  Regarding how I would want people to respond, just listening is big enough.  But the question is a bit misdirected (not your fault) because you cannot pick out the response someone will have to any given complaint.   Moreover, I would personally feel a bit weirded out if people walked on eggs, or acted too methodically in consoling my issues, because it does not help you feel back to normal.  Probably the biggest thing is not lingering on the issue too long, but moving forward.  I do not often think of my shunt now, mostly because I still can accomplish most things fairly well, much as your sister probably will with time.", "New to this forum! Hi, my names Samantha (21F) and I am from Manchester, England. I have had hydrocephalus since birth. It was discovered when I had been experiencing a cold for two weeks and my mother had a feeling that something was wrong. I then had an operation at 5 months old to insert a shunt. I have not had many problems since then (I have been very lucky). I was discharged from the children\u2019s hospital when I was 13/14 after an MRI scan of my head that I would have yearly to monitor my condition.\n\nWhen I was 17 I had to go into hospital as I was experiencing major headaches, nosebleeds and my shunt was very prominent from my neck with a rash also present. (The rash also comes up when I am stressed, crying or anxious too. Does anyone else experience this?)\n\n They took me in overnight. I am not sure what the procedure is called but they did something to do with a \u201creservoir\u201d that you have along your shunt to see if the shunt is functioning correctly. Thankfully, it was. However, when looking back at my last MRI scan from the children\u2019s hospital, they discovered a small glioma in my brain that they say could have been what caused my hydrocephalus in the first place. \n\nAlthough I have hydrocephalus, I do not really understand a lot of the symptoms of it. I know that I experience vision problems (I have had glasses since I was 3 years of age), I struggle with my balance, my memory and incontinence (which I feel very ashamed of and do not know how to control). I have recently been under investigation for a possible thyroid nodule which I am worrying about. Despite that, I live a pretty normal life. \n\nI do not know whether this is the right place to ask for advice or help but\n\nI have been very down the past few years and I do not know why. I have seen that people with hydrocephalus can suffer with depression and anxiety and I have had CBT to help me with how I am struggling with university and workloads but nothing is helping. \n\nI am starting to read into everything and I just want answers but I do not know who I can talk to about getting extra help. I do not know whether I am struggling with depression but I definitely suffer with anxious and intrusive thoughts. \n\nI really do not want to self diagnose but I do not even know how I go about that getting a diagnosis because the last time I went to my GP they just commented on how a lot of their patients struggle with anxiety. \n\nI am struggling a lot with writing; I feel like I do not have an intelligent bone in my body and I keep forgetting a lot of simple things. I would really appreciate some help. Hey friend! Welcome. \n\nI definitely feel you with the depression/ anxiety issues. \n\nHave you tried seeing a therapist at all? I have found that to be helpful. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this, but we are definitely a loving community. Feel free to air your grievances here. \n\nShit sucks, but you have got people who can partially empathize here, which is nice. \n\nHang in there! Your writing is very clear and coherent, and that tells me that you *do* have an intelligent bone in your body. I find it helpful to try to notice when I am making judgements about myself - would I think that was a kind thing to say if I said it about or to someone else? If not, do not say it about yourself!\n\nI cannot relate to your struggles as I was only diagnosed with hydrocephalus as an adult, but I imagine the fact that you have grown up with this means perhaps people around you (parents, doctors etc) assume you know everything about it? As a kid you would possibly not have been told the full story, so perhaps it would be useful to ask your parents (or book an appointment with your consultant!) to just give you a run down of all the details about your brain and your medical history. \n\nAlso, mental health difficulties are extraordinarily common. They may be related to your struggles managing the symptoms of your hydrocephalus, or they may not be. Either way, speaking to your GP is the best place to start, and it is absolutely ok to let them know that you did not find CBT that helpful! There is lots of other therapies that you can try. I personally like DBT and mindfulness, but it is not for everyone :) Good luck x Hi! Hydro guy with 36yo, shunt at two months and never had issues (one surgery to extend the tubing and that is it). Like you, it took me way too long to start researching this stuff which is really silly...\n\nFeel free to chat if you want to ask questions or just compare symptoms. I do not think I have any particular issues (super lucky given that my hydro came from Dandy Walker Syndrome!) but maybe it will help with the anxiety and just having someone to talk to. Hello!  Know that each person on this forum is here to support you.  Message us often and we will share what we know.  \n\nPlease do not be hard on yourself. Be persistent and work through your symptoms but accepting those that cannot be treated is just as important.   \n\nYou are  alive!  Now what you do today and tomorrow is up to you, make the best of your next 70+ years you have left on this planet. I am 29 and like you, I have intrusive thoughts but they are more about my lack of moving up the \u201cladder of life\u201d like my friends. All of my friends are married and have a home for themselves and kids and a 4 year degree or more. While, I have a 2 year degree, slowly and I mean slowly working towards my 4 year degree while still living at home with my parents. I have dropped multiple classes due to having to have shunt surgery and not being able to retain all of the information that I am learning in my classes. I just keep reminding when these thoughts pop into my head, that I am still working towards my goals and to just keep pushing forward one day at a time. I agree. Reaching out to your community is a hard thing to do sometimes but when we do we find that we are not alone. I am also new here. I was diagnosed with hydrocephalus in 2020 I agree. Good luck and keep up your hard work! Oh what a year to get that diagnosis! I hope you are managing ok! July 2020. They told me in the hospital and I had a vp shunt put in that day. I really like the surgeon. Nice guy and good at what he does. I was getting horrible headaches and I could not sleep. It was rough. \nI think I have it sorted now 6 months later with a couple adjustments. \nI have other issues I am dealing with now, afib and my sleep apnea. They all seem to be tied together. \n\nI just had a catheter ablation last week that did not seem to solve my afib so I am trying to figure that out.\n\nThank you for asking. This seems like a great place to chat about hydrocephalus.  \nEveryone is very kind.  Its good to reach out to others. Its hard for me sometimes but when I remember that there is strength in numbers and I can help it is good all around. \n\nWhat is your story. If you do not mind me asking Oh it really sounds like you have had a rough year! Glad the hydrocephalus seems to be settling for you now. The afib sounds scary on top of all the brain stuff. I really hope you are able to find support in places like this! \n\nMy story.. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour when I was 22 after like a year of symptoms like headaches, nausea, extreme fatigue, and eventually double vision (that is what got me to the hospital which led to a diagnosis). I had surgery to remove the tumour but they could not remove it all. I recovered after about 6 months and got back to work, but after about a year I started experiencing the same symptoms again. The tumour had grown back a tiny amount and caused more hydrocephalus. They managed it this time with a vp shunt. A year after that I had a stroke (a transient ischemic attack) Turns out my shunt was blocked, so I had a shunt revision. That was about 2 years ago and all good so far :) Wow that is a lot. You sound like a positive person, fingers crossed for you. Keep up your bravery!\nI think what Ive learned this year is be a squeaky wheel when you do not feel good. \nNice to chat with you. Good luck to you. Haha lots of people say I am brave, but (as I am sure you will understand!) you do not get much choice about it! Just got to keep going :) good luck to you too - hopefully you can find a community of people who can relate to your heart troubles as well!", "What is the worst you have seen with this condition My mom is 65 has had shunts put in, in 1995. She is needing replacements just now but her condition has gotten pretty terrible. We have been in and out of the hospital for the past month and a half and she is still in ICU but that is because she is had complications with it. Hoping this does not last. There is been times when is she is been pretty much a vegetable and not even remembering the simplest things, like the year. Has anyone ever had experience with this? Apologies if this makes no sense going on about an hour of sleep. Her being in ICU has pretty much caused her to get delirious and trying to help her stay calm has been an adventure. My son handles his hydro very well, he had an ETV on day 1 on life, and has not had a problem since (now at 13 months). However I saw my grandma slowly succumb to and die due to dimensia. It was very hard to deal with and process appropriately, particularly the intermittent remembering. I cannot imagine the distress your mom's shunt replacement and subsequent complications has caused you, and I empathize greatly.\n\nSome of the hydro groups on Facebook have real horror stories. Parents from less wealthy countries post about lack of access to medical care and death of children, and individuals whose hydro or hydro-tangential developmental problems mean they will never walk or worse, children with more surgeries and complications than age. Adult onset hydro and related are discussed there, but there seems to be selection of users, e.g. older individuals use fb less, so less discussion of old age hydro issues.\n\nAgain, I am sorry to hear about the problems your mom's hydro is causing. Everything about this condition sucks. Has she had the new shunt put in? She had it put in during thanksgiving but had complications from it. Now we are waiting to get the whole thing replaced since it ended up getting infected.  She currently has a VP tube directly from her brain draining to help. Just waiting for her to finish her round of antibiotics for her to get the device put back in. Thank you. I appreciate it. I will check out the Facebook page and see what people have to say. Right now since she is been in the hospital and ICU for the past month she is gotten pretty delirious but we are still staying hopeful that once the shunt gets replaced it will get a bit better for her.", "Does hydro affect both sides of the brain? My hydro was caused post a big hemmorhagic stroke, leaving me with cerebral palsy but only affecting one side (as the hemmorhage happened on one side of the brain) Yes, it does affect both sides.", "Snorkeling As long as you do not dive deeply, has anybody had a good experience snorkeling with one or more shunts (I have two)? I do not have trouble with water depth or altitude. I have gone skydiving and scuba diving. I also have two shunts. I stopped snorkeling after my neurologist found out and told me that I could not scuba diving due to my epilepsy. Sorry to hear they you had to stop! I will be receiving a cochlear implant, so maybe that is the reason for why I am not supposed to scuba dive. My neurosurgeon said no to scuba diving and skydiving. Snorkelling is fine as long as I do not dive  deep. That is what I have heard, too, and what my doctor has told me. I have two shunts as well and I have never had trouble with snorkeling. However, if I go more than 3 feet deep my head starts to hurt really bad due to the pressure. That is great to know, thanks!!", "Sleep Does liquid retention lead to hydrocephalus?", "Am I allowed to drink If I have Hydrophecalus? I have only drunk once. Yes its fine. Never had any issues with drinking other than hard hangover afterwards, being Eastern European with Hydrocephalus aint easy, i would suggest though that you drink resposibly so you dont bang your head somewhere Also worth to mention that if you are on some medication double check with your doctor or at least read leaflet I' do not know if the hangovers are worse ( obviously dehydration is not great for hydrocephalus ) because of hydro or because I am getting older but its definitely a consideration I was asking the same questions back in college. Years later and a mostly responsible amount of beers and whiskey later I am still here. \n\nI usually do not drink a day or two after a bad headache though. But that is just a precaution. Should not affect anything with your shunt, but as with anything like alcohol, moderation and self discipline are key. I would definitely check with your doctor if you are on medications or if you have any other conditions. Speaking for myself, my neurosurgeon told me I am ok to drink alcohol if I want (I just do not because I have really bad nerve damage and find that alcohol really exacerbates the pain). Take this for what it is worth.\n\nWhen you drink, your brain gets dehydrated. When your brain gets dehydrated, it basically shrinks. When it shrinks, it pulls away from your skull. This is what causes a hangover headache.\n\nThink of your hydrocephalus and how that will affect it.\n\nMy kids doc told him he was better off smoking weed than drinking because it will not make his brain shrink. I have never got drunk I have only done shots of alcohol nothing else. It was my second time but I just wanted reassuring that it will not fuck me up. Which it sounds like it does. Also if you really are concerned for my safety please do not panic because the only go to drink that I like is Malibu which is not great but it is more of a mixer. Yes I am young I am not at legal drinking age  but I have only taken shots of alcohol. And only twice now that was my second time. Just make sure you Uber home.", "Anybody else get headaches when lying down?  Hi there.  First time on this subreddit....I do not have hydrocephalus,  but my wife does, due to a benign (?) tumor in her midbrain that shut off the cerebral aquaduct ( it cant be biopsied, but not growing). She had an ETV instead of a shunt. She has hella headaches upon laying down at the end of the day - not as bad in the middle of the day (for a nap).  Next neuro visit, we are going to  talk about this exact issue. I will report what transpired. Its almost the same as me! I have a germinoma in midbrain but it is not benign but I started chemo. They did an ETV while doing the biopsy. Now everytime I go to sleep i wake up with a strong headache usually requiring opiods. Please tell me what your neuro said because I would also like to know Sorry to hear your situation, hope you find relief. I will let ya know ..", "I am entering my 6th month since I had my ETV This is a really big deal for me so I wanted to share. \n\nI did not know I had hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis until I was 26 years old, I found out because an eye doctor saw the increased eye pressure and I got an ETV a week later. \n\nRecovery was hard, I needed help learning to walk again and was constantly tired\n\nI have made huge progress, and now that I am nearing the 6 month mark, it is more likely that the hole they made will not close and my surgery will be successful and I will be shunt free, but I also know with this disease you never really know. I will have more info in October when I get my follow up appointment, but things are finally starting to look good for me Thank you for sharing your experience. Wow, thanks for sharing and I wish you the best moving forward. I saw a neurosurgeon last week who thinks I may be a candidate for ETV. Congratulations on your progress and great news about the hole still being open at 6 months! Why did you need help walking again? I did not know that was an issue for someone so young. Thanks for sharing.  Currently 2 years out myself after a number of shunts, with the same pathology. Glad to hear it worked for someone else.

I was feeling along my shunt today and noticed it- should I get it checked out?  Not sure what kind of shunt you have. Also, not sure if this is too obvious: my shunt has a spot you can press in to sort of \u201ctest\u201d it to see if it is draining correctly. Could it be something like that? I have been told not to do that at home, only for neurosurgery to do it. This may be the case, was just trying to help narrow down the possibilities of what OP might be describing to help them out with their question. This is good info, through, so thank you! :) I press mine on the daily. Non programable shunt though. Not great to give that kind of medical advice to strangers on Reddit. Unless someone is trained to do that on themselves, it is risky. My neurosurgeon told me it is not a big deal\u2026 I am saying what I do that is all. Can you actually feel the draining happening or being blocked? That is really intriguing. Mine is also non programmable but from 1984, so I am not sure if it is even possible to do the same. I actually feel the reservoir compress and I kind of hear it. I actually find it helps a lot when I do it myself. Call. Your.

Prior to getting my shunt placed, I wanted to go a get some chiropractic adjustments - specifically neck and shoulder adjustments. Am I able to do this with my shunt in though? Has anyone else gotten adjusted on their shunt side? What was it like? Did it affect the shunt in any way? I would love to hear your experiences. \n\nI keep on forgetting to ask my Neurosurgeon when I speak to him, please help! I am no doctor,but it is probably not a good idea.

Is it safe? You know, I have hydro (non-shunted) so it is a little different.  I am pretty sure you couild contact the Hydrocephalus Association for the deal.  This has got to be a topic they discuss.  Have you ever connected to them? Yes I have. From what I have been told, it is different for everyone. I was told you could get pregnant while having Hydrocephalus but it could cause complications in the third trimester with the change in pressure and the shunt may need to be altered. I have obstructive Hydrocephalus so I was trying to see if anyone else, by chance, experienced this? Out of curiosity has anyone ever talked to you about ventriculomegaly?\n\nMy oldest (now 17) was diagnosed with arrested hydro at 18 months, no shunt.

Wife and I had a baby girl almost 2 years ago, no issues with birth other than her BP trending higher so they induced and delivered her at 37 weeks and 1 day.  We got pregnant again and this time a boy (my joy!). Everything was going well and looking good. Wife's BO then started trending higher and we were talking with her OB Dr about inducing. They scheduled a Biophysical to check everything was alright to deliver. He passed that no problem. Wife and I left to go home and got a call back from the Dr saying \"yea we need you to go to this hospital and have a level 2 ultrasound done. Your son has fluid in his brain\". We jumped in the car and took up.. the whole way thinking \"what the hell is going to happen\".  We got the ultrasound done and my wife being a nurse noticed he had what looked like an blood clot or something and his brain did not look right.. met with the Dr at the hospital and was basically told he may die at birth 30%, or be born with a 90% chance of being intellectually challenged.. his head was large and they did not recommend vaginal delivery, they wanted to keep him in for at least 2 more weeks and just monitor Wife's BP.  We then transfered everything over to Abbot Children's Hospital and started a day with meeting with different Drs and such to go over things with wife and baby. Wife had her appointment and her BP was staying high and the nurses and Drs came in and said \"were having baby today\". This was a week after our unfortunate news. Scared and worried we waited for everything to line up for a C-SECTION. Our son was born that night, looking normal other than he is a big boy, long and his head was not very large at birth. This week we have meet with a few neurologist to go over plans for our boy. His head has not grown much but a little and they have watched the pressure in his head.. they say he has sings of building pressure in his head, jittery, sleepy, temps up and down. He is been eating some via bottle and the rest via tube. He was off oxygen and then put back on because he was resetting a little. We have surgery scheduled for Monday. It is just hard seeing your little one like this and surgery is a bit concerning especially him being only  a week old. They are going to put in a shunt for him, they do not see any reason for developmental issues as his brain tissue looks good.\n\nJust wanted to share our story and maybe get some advice from anyone here. \n\nTL;DNR. Week old son has been diagnosed with Hydrocephalus and is having surgery Monday to put in a shunt. Concerns and worried. Hi, my little one had a similar issue at birth. It took them a little longer to catch it (not til after birth) and he unfortunately had a severe case and the surgery at about 2 weeks old. \n\nHe is two years old now and a sweet, smart, perfect little man with language and motor skills ahead/on track. \n\nStay strong! Hello, I am a 23 year old male born WAY early at 29 weeks of pregnancy with hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. The day I was born the doctors were pretty much immediately getting my parents ready for the worst news possible. Had a VP shunt put in within my first weeks alive. My first five years I had a revision each time, the technology was still new when I was younger. Even had a 6th revision when I had appendicitis because they were afraid of infection, made it a VPL shunt. So after 13 surgeries, 12 which were neuro, I can gladly say I am alive and healthy as any other person. I know the stats can be scary but I hope people like me can inspire your wife and you to keep up hope. My parents went through some seriously tough years but keep your loved ones close for support and find communities like these to talk about your feelings. Love and good thoughts to your baby boy, would love to get an update to how things went. God speed. Hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis is known to be the type of hydro with the best outcomes. Also, doctors always try to prepare you for the worst, so not everything they say may turn out to be true. Thank you all for the support and your stories. Will keep you posted after surgery tomorrow. Surgery went well.  He was awake when he came back from recovery and they said he was wide awake with them. He was just taken off his IV so they are restarting his feedings, he is only taking about 10-15ml of breast milk via bottle the rest is still fed through his feeding tube.  Otherwise they took his dressing off his head.. looks good.  He has an ultrasound today to check placement of his shunt.  Seems good so far all in all.  Thank you for the support and stories, again, appreciate it all. Glad to hear.  It is a tough journey, but getting the right treatment matters most. Hope he does well.", "Is anyone with a shunt really anxious about people touching their neck/head? Part of it for me is that those areas are really tender due to scar tissue and having old tubing that they could not remove. It is to the point that I cannot wear lanyards or certain types of necklaces (thankfully I was able to trade my work lanyard for an arm sleeve). Anyone else? I feel the exact same way! I have two shunts (one on each side of my head) and I always get really anxious when people touch my neck/head. I just guess it is because our brain remembers all the trauma and kind of instinctively warns us about any potential danger with it. Makes sense! I get a shiver down my spine every time someone does it, especially down the old shunt line, despite the fact that I no longer have any shunt tubing.  Strange but interesting that others have it! Wife knows to keep hands away from top left side of my head, and I cannot wear ballcaps any more, but beyond that... Yes. I hate when people touch my head as my scalp is super sensitive.", "36-year-old VP Shunt I have had my shunt since I was 2 days old. Myelomeningocele/congenital Hydrocephalus.

He also stated that since I am not sick enough to be in the ER, I am \u201cprobably not shunt dependent\u201d, and he will follow up in 6 weeks after my shunt series x-rays. Meanwhile I am in constant pain. Anyone have headaches not related to their Hydrocephalus, basically could it be something else? Have you found anything that works for pain? I have only tried Tylenol and Imitrex and they do not help. I also have severe fatigue to the point I barely make it to work. The last time I needed surgery was 31 years ago so I am a little nervous/mad he mentioned surgery without even having x-rays or CT Scans. Ahhh. The last VP shunt I had, I had had since I was about 5. We thought I was no longer shunt dependent.... And then, at 27 I started having terrible headaches - but the CT scans did not show anything abnormal. I talked to a doctor who my insurance claimed was the \"world's authority\" on shunts - and he told me that my symptoms were not consistent with shunt failure. I was given migraine meds and told to keep an eye on it.  \n***That night...***  \n\n\n  \nI had the first seizure I had ever had, in the middle of the night. I fell out of bed and landed on my neck, cutting off my air supply. Thankfully *the cat* heard me fall, and started howling until my Mom came to my bedroom to investigate.  \n\n\nMy point: be very, *very* careful. After this event, they scheduled me right away for shunt revision. Duly noted. That is one badass cat.\n\nI literally JUST got my results after posting this, and my shunt IS disconnected. I feel like I am not being taken seriously because I have been so lucky for 36 years (all things considered). It is like you have to have a seizure or become comatose...or die for medical professionals to take notice. It has probably been disconnected for some time now, but I have been in pain for some time now. My follow up is not until the 28th, but I am considering being such a pain in their ass that they see me sooner. 36 y.o. here and never had any issues so far, still the VP shunt I had when I was two months.\n\nDo not you have any other surgeon or neuro doctor you can go to to have a second opinion on the matter? No, I do not have another neuro doctor as I have never had an issue for the past 31 years. I would have loved to seek a second opinion instead of resorting to Reddit. I just got my results, and will go from here. Keep at it. Though I guess it depends on where you are and how the healthcare system works whether there is a way of making your concerns heard by someone who will listen.\n\nI got my shunt at 10 months old after a tumour and they assumed I was not using it as i did not have any issues until my teens. You can probably get the gist from my history commenting on other threads what happened next.\n\nUnfortunately, I do think doctors treat shunts like a house of cards and will not touch them until the situation is dire, so you might need to mentally and logistically prepare for that (i.e. Be aware of the symptoms, carry a shunt alert card, update your emergency contacts and, if you live by yourself, make it possible for a trusted neighbour or paramedics to get in of you cannot get to the door - I have a combination-entry key safe by my front door for this reason). The thing is I do not think my issue is related to my shunt, I was just a little let down that they instantly go to that. They even tried to tell me that I \u201cprobably\u201d outgrew it, when I was full grown the last time I had x-rays. I will continue to explore other routes. Crazy, I have had my shunt for 18 years. And I have recently been struggling with fatigue and migraines. Migraine meds do not work and I was put on light depression meds for the fatigue and that does not work either. Also struggling with nausea which does not seem to be connected to anything. My neurologist says nothing is up, but something tells me to be suspicious, like you. That is crazy...very similar to my issues. As you probably know headaches are super tricky to DX especially when you have got the added complication of a shunt. My shunt is 7 years old now and I have had headaches the last five of those years. My neurosurgeon wanted to do surgery (naturally) but my neurologist wanted to try some more medications. Been doing great on aimovig which is a migraine preventative. I smoke weed to help when I get a migraine because like you nothing you can get at the store or pharmacy works. Basically I would try to go the non surgical route first and see if you can find relief. If not then a new shunt it is!  Thank God that is a minor procedure at least. Best of luck hope that helps. 31 years ago was your surgery related to hydrocephalus, or might this be your first need for surgery since your initial shunt placement?\n\nHow is your vision? Do your headaches change depending on whether you are standing up or laying down?\n\n46/M, shunted at birth (VP), 5 revisions since about age 20. Now VA shunt.", "Can dogs detect hydrocephalus?? My girlfriend has a dog that is clingy to me than he is to her. I have hydrocephalus and he follows me everywhere, even when I try to shower. I have had hydrocephalus since birth, and even though this dog is hers, and she is had him since birth.. (the dog is about a year old) he prefers me. We sleep in separate beds because I tend to move around a lot and he chooses me to sleep with instead of sleeping with her. I have tried Googling it, but nothing came up.", "My Experience I have hydrocephalus.  My shunt was inserted when I was 28 days old.  I have had 5 surgeries.  Several were done when it malfunctioned during my childhood and one was simply to lengthen my tubing to accommodate growth (which is funny since I have been 4'9\" since grade school but have enough tubing to grow to be 7'). LOL\n\nWhen I was in my early teens we were told I had outgrown my need for the shunt.  While it was kept in place, for the next 30 years it was never looked at again, and, any medical issues I have had since (chronic headaches, vertigo, back/neck pain) were all determined to be allergy related or no known cause.  Hydro and a potentially failing shunt were never discussed.\n\nIn May 2017 I woke up one day with double vision and paralysis in my legs.  I was rushed to the hospital and a neurologist initially diagnosed me with Guillain Barre Syndrome.  3 weeks later I was completely blind and now my arms were also losing function.\n\nI was transferred to Hopkins and was immediately had my shunt checked and it was determined I DID still need it and that it had malfunctioned.  It was replaced immediately.\n\nI regained use of my legs and arms but not my vision.  However, otherwise, I am fine now.\n\nI have seen many threads about peing no longer needing their shunt and if they should remove it.  I am sharing my experience, not to scare anyone, but to encourage you to always live and consider medical issues as if you still have hydro and  need a shunt, even if the doctors say otherwise.  Get regular check ups to ensure it is still working.  Always tell other health providers about it.  Do NOT have it removed.  Even if you supposedly do not need it, the shunt is not hurting anything.  Leave it in place.\n\nI just do not want anyone else to let their guard down and stop living like they have hydro and go through what I did.  I love my life and it worked out for me.  I am not complaining.  However, if what I went through can help someone, that is my goal. Wow! This is just shocking medical practice. I hope you can some sight back. Thank you. I did get some of it back but I am legally blind now. I can no longer work and I am considered disabled. But, it could be worse. Thank you for sharing your story. I am so sorry you went through this, and are suffering the after-effects. Sending you all the hugs", "I am lucky if I can get a shunt to last for more than a few years IF that. Does anyone else have this continuing problem?  Do you know what the issue is? It is common people\u2019s bodies to reject implants. I have felt that the Codman-Hickman Programmable shunt I have has never worked from the get-go (after 21 revisions of a VP Shunt). \n\nI went to the Neurosurgeon last week, and suddenly he is trying to convince me after 16 yrs that the CT-scan looks \"better\"??\n\nThe first shunt I had only lasted 16-18 months. When it was finally looked at (I began to complain 2-3 months after it is placement) the Dr. took it out and it was FULL of calcium &amp; protein deposits.\n\nI think some people are just more prone to these shunts not working and needing replacement that others.\n\nSorry to hear about yours needing replacement that often. I wish I could get MY neurosurgeon to make up his mind. 6 months ago, he wanted to do an EVT.....just a few weeks ago, \"You CT-scan looks better than previous scans.\" I am really confused so I know how you feel.....so sorry! :( With current VP shunt failure rates, it is not you fault. I hate to post statistics because they put people in a fatalistic mindset &amp; they attach to the numbers, but it is common. You are not alone. At all! \n\nPersonally, yeah, I made 3 years this year without a new shunt for the first time in a decade+. Woo. I joke that I am rough on mine, but it is not like I am going smashing it against the wall or someone is fist. Some just do not need another one. It is an imperfect solution. \n\nSorry for your repeated surgeries too. \n\nAs u/Quilt1974 is sharing, a huge issue can be due to build up in the shunt. I call it the cell poop factor. This is not scientifically valid, but I wonder if diet for a less inflammatory lifestyle has an impact on the protein deposits (as seen in other neurological inflammatory diseases with protein deposits).", "Infection Ok so I do not have an infection on any of my incision but what does it look like? What are indications of infection or what should one do?\nAlso how do you clean your wounds? You will likely be able to tell it is infected. The wound will look pretty gnarly and you will likely have some tenderness and you may not feel well.  In terms of cleaning, I waited until my stitches were out to clean the actual incision site, just for fear of pulling my stitches or something of the like.   Well they told me I could talk a shower after 3 days so I took a shower yesterday. The Staples scare me tho If they gave you the green light then you are good to go. Just be careful I took another shower today it is scary because without looking in a mirror I have no idea where my scars are plas my boyfriend does not let me take a shower when I am alone ", "THE WAY I SEE IT, PLEASE TELL ME I AM WRONG, SORRY, I NEEDED TO VENT. My daughter has Tourette's syndrome and we do not know what to do anymore.\n\nA CT scan showed Hydrocephalus in the first two ventriculus, and bowing in the third, without a tumor. She was born premature and had a rough child birth, perhaps those two things may have damaged her fourth ventricle, preventing it from fully developing.\n\nAs the choroid plexus produced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 0.2 - 0.7 ml per minute or 600-700 ml per day, the rate of her body's absorption of CSF would have decreased, which meant her CSF pressure would increase as a result, because it is like filling a balloon faster than its draining. \n\nSince this happened slowly over time, her brain had room to grow, and now there is no more room left, so her brain tics in distress. \n\nThey performed an Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) surgery, to try and relieve the pressure in the third ventricle, but the Tourette's or the tics did not go away.\n\nWhat if her brains expansion from the Hydrocephalus, damaged the arachnoid granulations ability to absorb the CSF. \n\nWhen pressure initially released from the surgery, maybe the reason it looked like there was flow from the third ventricle, is because there was, initially, until the pressure equalized across the fourth ventricle.\n\nWould not that mean the total flowrate would have dropped back down to what it was before, because of the Hydrocephalus.\n\nAn ETV would not have helped her tics in the first place, because that could not have stopped the CSF pressure from rising, because the four choroid plexus are still producing the same amount of cerebrospinal fluid, at the previous absorption rate that caused the Hydrocephalus in the first place. \n\nHer TS is now including episodes of narcolepsy cataplexy, and sometimes it is hard for her to wake.\n\nThe VP shunt has to be the best solution, because the shunt will make sure the CSF pressure stays low, allowing her brain a chance to recover, if it ever does.\n\nI love her more than there are stars in the sky. \n\nI hope the VP shunt is the safe option, because I am dead without her. Hope it works.  Give it time as it takes a while for swelling to go down and for the brain to fully adjust, follow surgeons advice.  \nKeep us posted. My personal experience with a vp shunt is that it takes time for things to reach equilibrium. And for me, revisions frequently. \n\nOn the other hand, some stuff is markedly better. Other stuff I had hoped got better never did. \n\nI had thought of sickness as being something amiss. You broke a bone. You have a cold. \n\nHydrocephalus, for me, means that every part of your reality is impugned, and it is so hard to determine what is real and imagined. \n\nPerhaps I misunderstood your question, and I apologize if so. \n\nLife with a working VP shunt is an order of magnitude better for me. \n\nI got my first placement as an adult, likewise my first onset. \n\nBest of luck to you and your family I do not believe ETVs work for everyone, which is why vp shunts are the more common intervention. My daughter was premature as well. Often that can result in an IVH (intraventricular hemorrhage) , essentially a bleed, which can create scar tissue which is what hinders the csf flow from the ventricles. Vp shunts are great devices. I forget my daughter has one at times. I understand the patience needed for this is unbearable at times. You are doing great. Thank you, my fear is that a VP shunt makes her more miserable than she is now. She is starting to get depressed and exhausted from the tics all day. Thank you so much. This brings tears of joy in my eyes. My own experience was that I am not made more miserable. \n\nAt no time ever has the shunt been a hurt except overdrainage once. \n\nI first got fitted with a static valve, which was fine until it needed adjustment.  Now I have an adjustable valve, and it is saved me from going back to surgery 3 or 4 times in as many years. \n\nYou are doing the rightest thing any parent or doctor can do. You know that, right? I do now, thank you.", "Current AMA with Hydro. Patient ", "Having surgery soon to fix disconnection between valve and distal catheter. Have not had a revision in over 2 decades. Am a bit nervous. I am 23, last revision was when I had just turned 2. Since then, really have had no symptoms: I always say I do not know what a true headache is, and I am seldom nauseous (I mean, if I am, it is from imbibing a bit too much alcohol). I still do not have any symptoms really, albeit a small tender bump near my shunt. It often shrinks and grows back in size over the course of the day. Felt it since about May. It was found out in March after getting checked out by my neurosurgeon for an issue that my parents and I were not sure was related, that my ventricles had enlarged. This differed radically from my last visit 6 years prior, when I had slit ventricles. After talking to my normal neurosurgeon's PA (who unfortunately is in the stages of retirement), and another neurosurgeon who is fairly new, and whom is going to be performing the revision, it seems that the longer part of the shunt tubing (which after Googling, I realize must be the distal catheter) has disconnected from the valve itself). If any draining is occurring, not all of the CSF is draining directly down the tubing, and some of it is getting trapped essentially in this \"pocket\", as they called it, under the skin near my shunt. My neurosurgeon's typical adage is \"if it is not broke, do not fix it\", and I never have any symptoms. Well, I still do not really have any symptoms, but it is technically broke now, therefore we should fix it. I do not like it, but I get the point.\n\nApparently, I had around 5-6 surgeries related to head stuff/hydro by the time I was 2. But of course, I do not remember that far back. Am still in college so I was initially concerned about how long the recovery time would be. Amazingly, both the PA and this new neurosurgeon said it would be just a day, even if re-connecting the catheter and valve will not work, and the entire tubing needs to be replaced! So I am happy with that I guess. Overall, just anxious over getting general anesthesia, since apparently they hook you up to a ventilator since your muscles are relaxed so much your brain forgets to keep involuntary breathing going. tl;dr I do not want to die!\n\nMaybe I am getting panicky for nothing; after all, people have surgeries literally every day, and neurosurgeons perform brain surgery nearly every day. To top it off, this is a pediatric neurosurgeon performing this. If he is careful enough to treat a small child/baby, he should be just as careful with an adult. \n\nThoughts? Advice? Good vibes? I could sure use some :) Just look at it this way:  Even though you do not remember, you have been through it before, so you can do it!\n\nSending good vibes your way! Tons of good vibes your way! You are going to do great. Neurosurgeons do this type of surgery all the time and are really good at it. It is scary for the patient and the parents (our son is 3 and has hydrocephalus and a shunt) but for the neurosurgeon it is like tying shoelaces. They know what to do. \n\nThe intubation may give you a sore throat but I have heard recovery is quick!! Maybe download a favorite movie to bring if you feel up to watching it after. I had surgery recently and the waiting and iv was the worst part for me! I hate needles. Once it was time for surgery they gave me some versed which made me really out of it and then the anesthesia so it has a very dreamy feeling in my memory. \n\nSending you best wishes. Surgery is never fun and brain surgery sounds scary I know! You will be fine and it will help. Also, I am amazed to hear you have not needed surgery in two decades! How wonderful! \n\nLet us know how it goes :) hugs!  I really appreciate your input! I am sorry you have to go through this same sort of thing with your little man. Here is hoping he is as lucky as I have been and the shunt he has now lasts him just as long, if not longer, with minimal to no symptoms.\n\nI am keeping my fingers crossed that a complete replacement is not necessary. If it is, well then, shit, that sucks, but I cannot very well object! And yeah, the only other \"surgery\" I have had done since the last revision was getting my wisdom teeth taken out, but that was done under local anesthesia, so I did not have to worry about a machine doing my breathing for me! That and I hate not knowing the exact extent of the procedure beforehand. Thank you so much! Yeah, my mom keeps telling me the same thing. They usually say moms know best... Right? I am 27 and I have had about 120 shunt revisions. You are going to be okay, you can handle this. You may need slightly more recovery time than they say, you will not be stuck in hospital but you might be a bit tired. Speak to whoever you need to at your university ahead of time so that if you do need some extra time, they are aware beforehand. \n\nGood luck, you will not need it though, you got this =) Oh gosh. I am sending you an internet hug if that is okay. I sincerely hope you do not need any more surgeries! Do you have a very complex case of hydrocephalus?  I just have slit ventricles. So every piece of debris in my CSF is going to go straight into the shunt. I am actually having surgery on Monday haha. It is a different one this time though. They are putting stents in some of the blood vessels in my brain where there is narrowing. Once this narrowing is corrected, the pressure in the veins should drop and allow CSF to move into the veins and drain that way. After 26 years of surgeries, I am sceptical, but we will see haha. Usually so. :)\n\nI went through two surgeries last year (neither of them related to my hydro), and I know the fear is real.  \n\nBut you will be okay. &lt;3 120?! Jeez! Yeah, I am sending you an internet hug too! That makes my problem seem so insignificant in comparison! Luckily, since I am doing this next Friday, I will only miss a blow-off kinesiology class, and it sounds like they are just going to the gym that day. Nothing big. Then I have the rest of the weekend at home for recovery if need be.\n\nHere is hoping your surgery on Monday goes over without a hitch! :)\ud83c\udf7b My fingers are crossed that this next surgery helps! Keep us updated :) You will be fine. I am almost 30 just had my 6th revision and everything came out fine. Good thoughts and prayers going out to you.  Good luck! Please come back and share your experiences. Perhaps you could tweet from post op :) That is a good idea I have not thought of before! I am much more of a lurker than a poster, as most of us probably are haha. I will make sure to keep you all updated. How did the surgery go?  Fine, thanks for checking back in! :) Check my post history for an update I made shortly thereafter! Ah! Thanks,just read it! My son has hydro. I pray he has the same sort of hydro experience growing up. ", "What could it mean when your CSF is high in protein &amp; red blood cells?  Your csf is derived from blood. We have a blood brain barrier in place to remove certain proteins, red blood cells and pathogens from the csf. It is essentially in place to protect or brains and spinal cords from infection. Red blood cells in the csf could be a sign of bleeding, or a that the sample got contaminated with regular blood during the extraction. I do not see where it says your red blood cell count.   How many cells? That was a very comprehensive CSF profile they ran.  What did your neuro say?   You had only borderline protein elevation but also pleocytosis so definitely an inflammatory profile.", "I have had 5 surgeries in the past 2 months So, as said in the title, I have had 5 surgeries in a short period of time, and they have complicated my life quite a bit. I now deal with a tremor in my right hand and short term memory loss. Has anyone else had this (even just 1 of the problems) happen to them? If so, do you have any ways to fix the tremor or correct the memory loss? I am currently in therapy for both, but I would like the opinion of someone it has actually happened to. Thanks for any advice you can give me! I had 6 surgeries in the space of 1 month and dealt with a short term memory loss and struggled with my speech a little bit too. These problems kind of just started going away by themselves as I started to recover. \n\nI had a follow up with my Neurosurgeon who said that it should start getting better in the next couple of months and tbh he is right. I am finding that my memory is getting better as each day goes by (it is been 8 weeks since my last surgery.) I still deal with a little bit of the short term memory loss but I get over this by writing EVERYTHING down. I find it pretty amazing how our brains heal themselves! Thank you for the reassurance and the tips! No problem at all. Be patient with yourself, your body and brain have been through a lot the past 2 months. Give it some time and I am sure you will start to see things improve - wishing you a speedy recovery!! Thank you! I have had over 200 shunt revisions and some of them were definitely in short spaces of time. I have often dealt with the memory loss just before and just after surgeries. I also had to relearn to walk after one of my surgeries. It is just a lot of waiting really, it will generally get better with time and therapy. I am sorry you are going through this. Thanks for letting me know your experiences! I had a series of 8 shunt revisions within a two month period. My short and long term memory have been horrible but it just takes time. I just took it slow and did not push myself too hard during the recovery process. Ok, thank you for the advice! I have had 8 revisions over the course of 3 years (16 in total) with 5 of them being near-death experiences. I have experienced all three of these problems, I usually have tremors in each of my hands and a mild speech problem. However, the memory lose is usually only after surgeries in which I will not be able to remember the day before or sometimes the entire week. What I have done to cope with the speech problem is I try to speak a lot slower which usually helps and to help with the tremors I will occasionally flex that limb which will help for a while.", "How often for Shunt replacements ? I am 15 had a shunt put in on 11 may 2021 after 2 failed etvs (1st in 2015 and 2nd in January 2021). i had to get a shunt put in because the etvs were not working and pressure was too much. Just wondering for anyone else how long did it take for you to need q shunt replacement or even if you have needed one after your first shunt placement? I am 16, and I had my first shunt revision when I was about 5 and my second shunt revisions about a year ago (so when I was 15). I think most people with shunts have to have it replaced at some point in their life, but others have not had a revision their whole life. When did you get it first put in ,as a baby? Yea at around 6 months I think I had three operations as an infant (insertion, revision, addition of a second shunt) and was then 'normal' until needing another shunt added at 22. It really depends on the person, their health, and their lifestyle. My shunt was placed at age 2 and was fine and dandy until age 12. I started to experience headaches and other symptoms of shunt failure, but these symptoms are so *generic* that my family and doctors thought I was **nervous, anxious,** basically thought \\~everything else was wrong\\~ before looking at my shunt.\n\n3 years later my shunt finally was replaced for the first time. \n\n6 months later my shunt had to get replaced due to a clog at the catheter. \n\nFour years later, my shut was replaced three times in three weeks because it would not stop clogging. The last revision that week the doctor turned the catheter into two and it finally worked.\n\nMy final revision (for now HOPEFULLY) was because of me. I got into a T-Bone accident in 2017 and my neck took a whiplash. The shunt broke in my neck and I got a headache a few months later (**take note, whenever your shunt breaks get it replaced!!!)** \n\nAfter all these revisions, I make sure to take it easy with hardcore sports, try not to put myself in dangerous situations. Always make sure I have health insurance lol. \n\nGood thing is that whenever I have a **shunt headache** (I KNOW when) that a surgery is quick and I am good as new the next day. Only fentanyl fixes the pain. It is just getting there and getting through the ER paperwork BS that is annoying. \n\nLast thing - figuring out the root cause was took forever in the beginning. I have slit venticle syndrome. I dont have hydrocephalus. I have chiari, and make an excess of CSF fluid (which raises my ICP pressure). knowing what you have will help tremedously if you ever have to go to the ER. There is no actuwl timeline, not like a car, where you should get the oil changed every 25,000 miles (or whatever it is). The shunt gets replaced whenever there is  a problem. Some people have to have a revision every year. Some people can go 30 years without needing a revision. I would say that, sure you would need at least one replacement if you are a child who is still growing. No specific amount of time Had placement at 1 month old, surgery to add longer shunt at 8 years old, got infected so another surgery a month after, then a fall / concussion at 16 that caused a failure/blockage, did not need another one yet and i am 33", "Traveling Ok so if you have been keeping up with my post you know my troubles with this disease the past 3 months and everything else I post on here. \nMy birthday is in 2 weeks and my boyfriend wants to take me back to my home town so I can see my family. He is concerned if I will be ok being hours away from my doctors and that something else will happen to me.\nAll 6 of my incisions still hurt so should I get pain meds from my surgeon before I leave or what do I need to do? How long ago did you get your surgeries? I had my 5th one Valentine's day and my 6th one March 5th or 6th it was a Monday Usually after a month you are okay to go back to your everyday routine, but if they all still hurt, you might want to check in with your ns about it just in case. If you are not having malfunction symptoms, you could be fine to go, but I would check in just to be safe Got To live your life.  I understand 100% why you are fearful of travelling, especially since you just had surgery, but the benefits of seeing family/friends vs potentially having complications is not an issue in my mind, go on the trip. \n\nI could not play sports, attend sleep overs, or travel for most of my childhood life.   Mom made sure I was safe but I missed so much.  \n. My mom did not let me play sports but there was this one year when she let me play soccer. Other than that I was allowed to go to sleep overs Safe than sorry. One never knows when there will be a shunt issue, however,in the first two years,the odds are higher. I just ask for the medicine If you are not far away from a decent hospital and your boyfriend knows your issues and can advocate for you if you cannot, go travel. You cannot live your life in a bubble. Shunts are the same everywhere and if something goes wrong, someone will fix you up. If you do your research and make sure there is an NS around where you are going, you will be fine. If you are still concerned, call the hospital near where you are going and tell them about your history so they know about you if you show up. Well the reason I moved to where I live now is because we do not have the medicine to actually treat this disease well enough Oh... Well, that is a problem. Maybe ask your neurosurgeon if he thinks you are well enough to go? Hi I know this is random but can you message me I have a question You have been messaged. Medicine for? The pain from my incisions. But I did not ask after all", "Hydrocephalus and vertigo I have been experiencing vertigo lately, moreso in the past month. It is become so bothersome that my PCP gave me some zofran, which helps a lot better for the nausea instead of just meclizine. I recently read that some hydrocephalus patients experience vertigo. Now I am wondering if anyone else here has had vertigo too, and if so, how long did it last? Months? Years? I work full time, and it is happened a few times already where the severe dizziness and nausea hit at work, and I had to sneak away to grab my zofran from my backpack. The past 2 days, I have had 3 episodes of vertigo. Also, I just had a CT scan of my head 2 months ago and my neurosurgeon said everything looked fine.", "Has anyone had the vaccine yet? Just wanted to see how others who have chronic headaches from hydrocephalus/shunt have felt after getting the vaccine.  Im scheduled to get the vaccine in a few weeks.  I know one of the side effects is headaches lol", "Neck pain with non-functioning shunt Hello all!\n\nI had surgery to insert a VP shunt at 5 months old, and my hydrocephalus is essentially nonexistent now but of course the (non-functioning) shunt is still in since my neurosurgeon says there is no point in putting me through another surgery to remove it. \n\nI have had it in for almost 20 years but recently started having an issue \u2014 basically i will wake up and have pain in my neck on the side of my shunt. It is not unbearable, but enough to be quite a nuisance. \n\nDoes anyone else often wake up with a sore neck due to their shunt? Any remedies? Is it a soreness like you are sleeping in an odd position or is it tender to the touch? Does it go away after you have been up for a while? It is soreness, and yeah it goes away... but I sleep the same way every night and sometimes I wake up with the pain and sometimes I do not \ud83d\ude02 That is a good sign in my opinion. As long as the shunt and tubing sites are not tender to touch then I would lean more towards the cause being a physical issue unrelated to the shunt. It is not a bad idea to bring this up with your doctor though since I am just some guy on the Internet. I plan on doing so. I would be a lot more worried if it was still a functioning shunt, but the neck pain is extremely irritating.\n\nThanks for your reply regardless! Did they remove the tubing? Nope! It is still all there That happened to me. The pain actually got worse and worse, and my shunt ended up bowing out of my neck under the skin quite a bit. I finally got an old pediatric neurosurgeon to take a look at it, and since it looked really gnarly, they did me a huge favor and ended up taking it out the next morning. \n\nIf you go this route, you will probably have super visual scars, so be aware of that. \n\nI do not regret getting it out, as time went on I had less and less quality of life. The pain was unbearable sometimes.\n\nMy one regret was that after I told the doctors to take out as much as they could, after they put me under, my mom told them to minimize scaring. They left some pieces in, and I actually got really sick a year and a half later due to this fluke of them introducing bacteria, and it slowly growing until it developed into bacterial meningitis. I was 18 at the time of the surgery, but it was in a children's hospital, so yeah, they listened to her. My pediatric neurosurgeon still sees me (for scoliosis) and said he would be willing to take it out when my scoliosis surgery is done but it is not mandatory.\n\nI am sorry that you had that happen, but yeah if they take it out it will be all of it. We already had a discussion of the pros and cons of keeping it in, and he said nothing dangerous will happen by leaving it in... plus I do not need another scar \ud83e\udd23 but I appreciate the insight from a person who is had it done. \n\nBut the pain I have sounds like the beginning stages of what happens to your shunt (the bowing) so I will schedule an appointment with him to ask. He is treated me since I was an infant so I trust his judgement. Thank you for your reply! Maybe it is scar tissue or calcification that only gets disturbed occasionally? I am thinking it could be scar tissue Gladly! Good luck! Definitely sounds like it. Most surgeons will not operate until one is symptomatic. Try an ice patch before bed or some gel for scar tissue. Hi there! I actually have this issue as well, my shunt has not been working for 3 years. It is been going on for three days now. It is uncomfortable to sleep on my right side and my neck and shoulders feel so tight. The back of my head also aches when I move my neck. I just worry because I hope it is nothing to worry about. I have this too! How is your coordination? I am really clumsy and I do not drive very well. I get stressed but I read that it is common. I am extremely clumsy, to the point where my friends make fun of me, but i am a great driver. I was not at first but once it was muscle memory I was fine.\n\nI am always stressed but I do not think it is related to my hydrocephalus, because my whole family has some form of anxiety \ud83d\ude02 Well, when I posted this it had been bothering me a while, but it went away! If your shunt is non-functioning and you do not have any other signs of infection, I would guess you are okay. :) hope it feels better! Thank you for your reply. I still have those aches and pains in neck tube. It actually has not worked for almost 6 years now and thankfully i have never had any issues. Dr thinks I never needed it in the first place (cautionary move when I was born). I hope he is still right LOL. I moved my neck to a weird angle the other day and felt pain in my shunt, i am not sure if I injured something and that is why i am having these pains. I do not have nausea or lack of appetite. Total opposite, i am always hungry :D hopefully this goes away soon, it is been almost a week now and I will be on a flight tonight. My hypochondria is really kicking in today :X Glad you are feeling better kind stranger! Sorry I meant stressed about driving. I have bipolar but schizophrenia and depression are in my family so I guess it checks out.\n\nWhat country do you live in? I am wondering if it might be worth taking out. I am from Australia but I am working part-time right now so maybe in the future. I am trying to get fit and I think I still walk a but funny. I live in the United States. And it is normal to be stressed about driving! Depending on where i am going I tend to get a little nervous and easily lost haha\n\nI spoke to my neurosurgeon and we decided it was not worth the risk of taking it out, especially since I need scoliosis surgery. It is essentially just chilling in my system, apparently the pain is normal and he just said run of the mill pain meds should do the trick and if they do not come see him again. \n\nI walk normally but I was lucky that I was extremely young when I got hydrocephalus, because of brain plasticity. My entire right side temporal lobe is damaged but since I was so young, other parts took over. Only thing I notice is my clumsiness. Well it is good you have not had any issues! When I made this post my hypochondria was definitely kicking up, but yeah apparently those aches and pains are entirely normal as long as one does not have a fever, etc.\n\nThank you! Hopefully the flight does not irritate it. Never really bothered me and I fly a ton. And sometimes it is just because you slept on it wrong lol", "How is IIH different from childhood onset Hydro. Aside from time of shunt placement?  As far as I can tell, as a non doctor, the bighest difference between the types of hydrocephalus and IIH is mainly the cause. They manifest somewhat similarly, but because their causes are different the treatments can vary. Because of the causes IIH can sometimes be treated with drugs for instance. \n\n&gt; While hydrocephalus is typically a disease that strikes children, there are several forms that can affect adults.\n\nThe most common forms of adult hydrocephalus are obstructive hydrocephalus, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension). The evaluation and treatment of these conditions is often quite different.\n\nIn adult onset of obstructive hydrocephalus, there is usually a mechanical blockage of the spinal fluid flow including tumors, webbings, Chiari malformation or prior hemorrhage. The usual treatment involves either endoscopic third ventriculostomy or shunting. If an MRI or CAT scan shows hydrocephalus and the patient is asymptomatic, immediate evaluation is appropriate.\n\nThe condition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is different than many forms of hydrocephalus. This disease typically is seen in older patients. The three classic symptoms are gait difficulties, memory difficulties, and difficulty controlling one\u2019s bladder. These symptoms can also be seen in many forms of dementia, so careful evaluation is needed in order to decide whether a particular patient would benefit from shunting, which is the only treatment for NPH.\n\nAt UNC, we use a team that includes neurologists, neurosurgeons, physical therapists and speech therapists to perform a lumbar drain trial in patients being considered for shunting. The patients are admitted to the hospital for testing of their gait and cognitive function. A lumbar spinal drain is then placed and several days of spinal drainage is performed. If patients have significant improvement, as judged by their physical therapy and cognitive testing by their physician\u2019s and family\u2019s evaluations, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is often placed. If the patients do not benefit from the lumbar drain, then it is presumed that the permanent shunting procedure would not benefit the patient and other treatments are explored.\n\nPseudotumor cerebri is a third and distinct form of adult hydrocephalus that involves high brain pressures without dilatation of the brain spaces. It is frequently seen in younger women with primary symptoms being headaches and visual difficulties. In severe cases, swelling in the back of the eyes, termed papilledema, can be seen by a skilled ophthalmologist. Initial treatment is usually medicine to reduce spinal fluid production, but if this is unsuccessful, shunting procedures can be necessary to protect the patient\u2019s vision. At UNC, we have traditionally performed an image-guided, stereotactically-placed ventriculoperitoneal shunt for treatment of this condition primarily in patients for whom vision loss or impending vision loss is the primary issue.\n\nUNC Neurosurgery has much expertise in hydrocephalus in both adults and children, and we have a strong interest in helping patients who are suffering from it.", "Shunt Infection? Has anyone had a shunt infection? One of my incisions is infected. My neurosurgeon\u2019s office just had me send in a picture and they prescribed me antibiotics and said to keep covered and Neosporin on it. \nI am wondering how to tell if it is in the shunt not just the surface layer.\nMy whole right side of my head (where the incision is) is swollen and painful, my right side of my neck is sore and hard to move, I am also vomiting a bit. My abdomen is also painful especially around the incision. Also extremely tired and loopy.", "Vinyl Hydrocephalus Window Decals! ", "Where Are Your Hydrocephalus Headaches Located? I was doing a lot of reading about different headaches and how you can sometimes classify the source of a headache by where it originates from. But when I go to look for the same relationship with hydrocephalus headaches I cannot find anywhere that documents where people commonly feel the headache from.\n\nIs it because it does not have a source, as in it is just **all** of the head? Or is it just because everyone is headaches are different? Is there a specific way you personally can tell if a headache is hydrocephalus related? I do not have hydrocephalus, but my son does. Prior to his shunt placement his headaches were in his forehead, kind of where the \u201cthird eye\u201d would be. I was diagnosed 6 years ago after surgery to remove a tumor on my neck, my \u201chydro\u201d headaches, as my hubs calls them, always start on the left side of my head in the back behind the ear (my shunt is placed on the right side of my head) but then hurt all over after the first few hours From personal experience, the headache associated with shunt failure (at least for me) seems to originate from the center of my head outwards. I guess that makes sense though since the ventricles are very enlarged should one be suffering from shunt failure. Generally front of my head, like someone is squeezing it in a vise. Had a running one the past few days so was able to immediately comment on it.\n\nSolution was two Tylenol and two Advil. Works every time.", "Hydrocephalus Mobile App hopes to be new mHealth Test ", "If someone has a bilateral brain bleed leading to hydro, do they have shunts on both sides?

Hi all! \n\nMyself and two others are students at Stanford University working on a class project that involves improving the detection of shunt failures and the consequences of current shunt-monitoring methods within hydrocephalus patients. \n\nWe wanted to directly get patients' perspective and thus created this survey. If you have hydrocephalus or anyone close to you does, would you be able to fill out the survey? It should take 5 - 10 min. If you would like, you can also add additional information either in the survey or on this forum post. \n\nSurvey link is ( \n\nWe will be summarizing the results from the survey and presenting it during our final presentation, but all responses are anonymous. No identifying information is collected. The survey is optional, and each individual question is optional as well. \n\nThank you so much for your input and time! Will you be posting your presentation here so that others know what you found? Hello, sorry for the late reply. I guess our project had two main aims: (1) to identify a significant need area, and (2) to propose a solution to that need area. As the survey questions might suggest, the need area we found was that shunts have a relatively high failure rate, but there is not a good way to monitor flow in shunts. Our concept solution is trying to address this but because it is in development we cannot share the progress. I am really sorry if this was not clear in the original post. I am just so happy, even if I do not know the results until years down the road, that research is being done to find a way to reduce the amounts of shunt revisions someone has to go through during their lifetime. I speak for all of us that have shunts, thank you for doing this kind of research and study!!", "Still having fluid build up So I have had the shunt for about 6 months now. It has been working pretty well for the most part, but recently I have been having a lot of fluid build up on top of my head. I guess I should mention that I also have craniostenosis and my skull has a few pretty deep dents, and have had a craniotomy as well, which has left a pretty large indentation, so the fluid tends to sit in these spots and seems to take a lot longer to drain through the shunt. I guess I am just wondering if there is a fix for this? I know the settings can be adjusted on the shunt, but my drs seem to think since the fluid build up comes and goes it is not worth changing the setting. I am just frustrated because this has been 21 surgeries, and the end goal was supposed to be no more debilitating headaches and now I am not even sure what will cause this build up of fluid. I am stuck again and feeling frustrated.", "One reason ", "Pressure when leaning. Newly diagnosed (may) as result of  brain tumour, now partially removed. I have a fixed low-mid pressure vp shunt but have noticed when I lean forward my head feels heavier and increase in pressure. Anyone else ever had anything similar? Hi. I hope you are feeling better. Sorry about the tumor. I have had hydro since birth and was first shunted at 20. For the first 11 years, I had a fixed valve, and now I have a programmable one. \n\nLeaning forward increases abdominal pressure, and that increases intracranial pressure. You may also notice the same feeling when you do other things that increase abdominal pressure like sneezing, coughing, straining, lifting, etc. They are all considered Valsalva maneuvers. \n\nI hope this helps. Be well. It really does, thank you so much. I initially had a programmable one but got an infection so they went to plan b. Thanks again You are welcome! I know it is overwhelming. The doctors give a lot of info, but I think sometimes they forget we do not know as much as they do. The hydrocephalus association (Hydroassoc.com) is a great resource for info and support. They have pages on IG and FB too. This happens to me as well. Be careful with stuff involving lots of bending or anything upside down (like certain yoga poses or whatever). It is not a sign anything is wrong, but it might cause some pain. Thank you for asking! This happens to me as well (programmable VP diagnosed September 2018). I get these pains and honestly thought it was because my shunt was not working correctly but at a lower setting, I was having a much bigger issue. Does the pain ever stop? It has not for me and my Programmable (Codman-Hickman) was placed in 2001. I get horrific headaches EVERY day and with the current Opiate crisis....getting a doctor to listen to you is like talking to a wall. I get a headache everyday and I am met with take ibuprofen. It does not help at all. I am already over this and I have not had my shunt for a year. Have you tried Excedrin PM? This sometimes works for me. I agree about Docs giving all kinds of info...we do not understand or need. When I had my first VP shunt place they did not have internet and the doctor opened this book with clear pages that showed you what they do.....uh....no thanks. I told him just to schedule the surgery and do it...and I am an RN! LOL!.... Yup, this, thanks for sharing!", "Has anyone has my experience? I am apparently exhibiting both high and low pressure and they prescribed me an abdominal pressure increaser that is pretty much a giant bandage and in a week I am supposed to add a wedge to my bed. I do not see how I come out of this not needing surgery because if it works they need to add a siphon and if it does not I am supposed to start exhibiting high pressure. Has anyone had this happen?", "Others experiences I am just wondering what other peoples experiences have been with hydrocephalus.   I have often read about other people who have had an unbelievable amount of revisions and surgeries and this has luckily not been the case for myself. \n\nI was diagnosed at 6 months old (currently M22) and had my shunt placed in. Throughout my childhood I had zero limitations on sports I could do, so I was an active kid. I even became a (relatively) successful swimmer, and was able to swim for one of the best teams in the NCAA. \nI would go to a doctor once a year for them to check my head out, but they always said that I was fine and eventually we just stopped going to the doctor. \n\nHowever, in the summer of 2015, during a routine weight session I felt a pop in my neck and after meeting with our medical staff we came to the conclusion that the shunt, or at least the calcification around it, had broke.  After a number of different doctors visits and a number of different tests, doctors determined that I did not need the shunt anymore and that they problem had fixed its self; I then had surgery to have the shunt removed.\n\nFast forward less than a month and I had symptoms that many sufferers of hydrocephalus have: Headaches, vomiting, blackouts. I needed emergency surgery to get a shunt put in again, therefore confirming that I do in fact need it. \n\nTl;Dr, I have hydrocephalus and have had virtually zero complications and live a normal life, one that is equivalent to a person without hydrocephalus. Does anyone else have any experiences like this? I would love to hear any stories that you guys have!  I had an ETV before I had a shunt and also lived a very normal life, going to school &amp; going out. I was relatively ok with the ETV and it was great, no shunt and no foreign object to worry about in my body \u2014 up until 3 months ago when I started having hydro symptoms again (vomiting, headache, balance worse than usual) and the neurosurgeon said my csf looked \u201cstuck\u201d. It sucks but that is the reality of this condition. Hope things get better for you though! I am one of the people that had many revisions. I had a shunt placed when I was an infant and through the years I have had a dozen or so revisions. I had an ETV done in 2007ish. I still have seizures, but AFAIK I do not have any hydro problems anymore. How frequent are your seizures? And do they impact your daily life? If I did not take seizure meds they would be every night. On Oxcarbazepine they are are like 1-2 a month, but can get worse when I am stressed.\n\nBefore they figured out it was seizures I would have terrible headaches, night terrors, and such. They really affected my life, but now not so much. I can usually go to work the next day if I have a seizure at night. My story is similar to yours. Diagnosed at 5 months, shunt in until end of middle school. Discovered the shunt was not functional but I did not need it. Mine, however, was not removed at all, even though it was not functional, because of the calcification. They did not want to do anything invasive if it was not causing any problems.  Fast forward about 11 years  of normal life. Developed very bad symptoms (vision problems, headaches, strangely no vomiting though). Lost weight because I could not eat without getting nauseous, could not drive or work. I consider this to be the end of my \"normal\" life. Had surgery 5 weeks after the onset of those symptoms. That was 1.5 years ago. Been a lot of ups and downs. My shunt is adjustable, so we have tried different settings, but it has never been normal again. \n\nI have noticed that a big factor for me is barometric pressure, I bought a weather app that tells me the pressure and Ive realized that I can pretty much explain a bad day by looking at the changes.  I am a relatively rare case. I was 17 in high school and the Marines (American military branch if your not from the country) came and did a recruitment event. There was a pull up competition for T-shirt\u2019s, water bottles, etc. I am not jacked by any means. But pull ups are my strength bc I am a climber and I am long and lean. Anyways, normally I could do around 20ish unbroken, however around 8, I got this weird headache. I let go of the bar and when I came down the headache intensified and my vision blurred, almost like that D-Day scene from Saving Private Ryan. It was weird. Anyways, CT scan revealed hydrocephalus. Got a shunt. Four years later (active lifestyle with no limiting factors from the shunt) I am bench pressing at the gym and I get another headache. Stupid fucking valve had malfunctioned. Revised the valve, past 4 years have been great, really hoping I do not get a malfunction again, but I am kind of guessing I will. My hydrocephalus is cause by this stupid, super tiny, tumor (benign), that has not grown or changed at all, but it is just big enough to block the ventricle where a normal persons CSF wouldmdrain. Unfortunately it is surrounded my arteries and it is super small so no1 wants to cut the goddamn thing lol. \n\nTLDR: super active like you, diagnosed 17, one revision four years later, doing great now. \n\nPs: do you do cleans in the gym? Shot in the dark, you might not be into Olympic lifts, but on the off chance you are, i was wondering what you do with cleans. My shoulders naturally sit forward slightly so in the catch position the bars weight is usually sitting on my shoulder rather than over my shunt trail. \n\n Wow that is crazy.  Actually doing cleans was how i felt the pop in my neck.  That pop was likely the calcification around my shunt breaking.  Thankfully I have not had an issue with catching cleans and it hitting my shunt trail.  I have noticed that I feel occasional kinks in my neck near the trail, but I am not sure if that is related. Wait so it was not the catch that caused the pop? It was the movement? Or did the catch cause it?  You know I am not really sure.  I originally thought that the catch itself was what caused the pop, but I think that there may have been additional factors involved as well.", "Surgery number/lifestyle Hey all, just wondering how many revisions you all have had and if you live a \u201cnormal\u201d life. I know that each person is different and this community has shown me how blessed I really am. \n\nI have only had 3 surgeries and life a normal lifestyle (college D1 athlete and graduate and can live on my own).  I just had my 4th surgery yesterday at 7AM. I live a somewhat normal life . I am just in and out of the hospital and neurosurgeon and neurologist appointment I have kind of lost count of how many I have had.  But I live a normal life 99% of the time :) if you have any questions,  do not be afraid to ask I have had 7 total revisions and I would say I live a normal life.  I have a wife and two young boys and we live in a house in suburbia.  I work as a software developer and I bike to work on a pretty regular basis.   I have had 17 revisions (26 surgeries total), and life is pretty normal. I have had four surgeries and live a normal student life. Prepping for college right now and will eventually live on my own. ", "Son has hydrocephalus My son was a premie and had an intraventricular hemorrhage they found 2 weeks after birth. He ended up with hydrocephalus and was given a shunt at 1 month old 8 years ago. He was involved in therapy to catch him up as a baby. He goes back every couple years for a ct or MRI.\n He started school late bc of maturity issues and i wasnt sure if it was related to the shunt or just a \"boy thing\" we did 2 years prek then kindergarten. He is in 1st grade now. We used to think he was high energy but he settled down. He was in trouble all last year for talking out of turn normal kid stuff. This year the teacher has been a little more helpful letting me know specifically his behavior rather than \"oh he was bad\" She told me a couple months ago he gets distracted easy, is very unorganized, his desk is always a mess. All of the sudden he is having issues chewing on his shirt and pencils. He refuses to do his work and has fallen asleep in class. He gets emotional if you call him out on anything.The teacher and principal called me last night for an intervention. It is possible it may just be an anxiety thing but to be safe I am about to call neurology to have a check up. I remember them telling me if he suddenly falls behind in school or has issues being sleepy or stomach issues to call them. \n   I can relate to most of the things you describe (granted my memory is a bit fuzzy going back to 1986 for 1st grade), but I remember always getting in to trouble for lack of attention. I even repeated pre school (my Dad gives me stick about it to this day). Even now I have to work really hard on tasks which require a lot of concentration. If I am out seeing clients during the day I can be mentally exhausted and ready for bed before the kids are.\n\nIt is hard to know what is \"normal\" and what is hydrocephalus- related (since I have had the condition all my life). Maybe your son's fatigue is related to the condition - or maybe he just resists sleeping at night like a normal 8 year old!\n\nThe thing I have learned after having kids though is they all do their own things and in their own time. Hopefully your little one will too! \n\nThe best thing my parents ever did for me was to not accept mediocre performance and to keep pushing me to do better. I was never able to use it as a crutch - and perhaps that approach might work for others. \n\nGood luck. This sub is not very busy, but we are around if you want to chat.\n Thank you! Yes it is hard to tell what is the norm 8 yr old boy vs what may be an issue with the shunt. He lies about everything too to avoid getting in trouble i just found out his teacher has sent 6 notes home about his problem. Hes used to be afraid to tell people when hes got a headache or if hes tired so its difficult to know what is really going on. The nurse doesnt take him seriously. I just found out he has being hanging out in her office. Instead of calling me they talk and she sends him back to class. Why do you think he lies? Is he trying to avoid going back to the doctor perhaps? \n\nI never passed on notes either - they got thrown into the bottom of my school bag where sandwiches went to evolve into higher life forms. I recall one time having a teacher staple a  note to the front of my pocket so it made it home. But surely your child's  teacher could email you - it is not 1986 !\n\nI can recall spending a lot of time in sick bay at primary school with headaches. With hindsight I know that in 99% of those cases nothing was wrong with the shunt (or wrong enough to go to a doctor!) and I should have just gone back to class (as I do today at work!)\n\nWhat does your son say about everything?\n\n\n Did the ivh cause damage? He could have difficulty with executive functioning. I would definitely call neuro and also try to see a Dev ped  I was thinking about that they cleared his dev ped fairly early from reg visits but had said call if we need anything.  Maybe. I was hoping as he got older he would be able to let us know if hes having any pain I am sorry you are going through this. My wife and I have had a similar situation recently. Our daughter had an IVH as well and was shunted after about a month. She is now in kindergarten and has done very similar things this year. She had a seizure back in September, and then started complaining about headaches for about two months or so. She was real sluggish and just did not seem to be engaged in school or dance class. The teacher was telling us about things like toe-walking and getting confused that we were never seeing at home. We were getting very worried. We met with her neuro and everything seemed to be fine except that they had to classify her as epileptic since it was her second seizure in about a year. The strange thing is after the beginning of this year, she just kind of came out of it. We thought for sure her shunt was not working properly or something. I still do not know what the cause of it was, but she is great now. She, like your son, is very sensitive. \u00a0I do not know if it is the case with your son, but our daughter is very sensitive to being sick or tired. Any time she is overly tired or even mildly sick it seems like it is amplified tenfold. I hope that you get it figured out. It is difficult having a kid with a shunt. It is a constant battle to determine what is normal and what is not. I wish well for you and your son. Yes my son is very emotional and sensitive. Sometimes when hes sick he plobs back in bed dramatically and says \"well i cannot go to school...\"  I called neurology we have an appt set up. I was irritated though bc whoever is running the phone is not a Dr and was trying to tell me his behavior isnt related to the hydrocephalus and cut me off before i could finish...going to have a talk with the Dr about her staff when i see her. We have dealt with those same issues too when calling our Neuro! It is so difficult to tell what behavior is caused by the shunt versus what is personality versus what has been brought on by being tired or sick, yet some people act like they know even though they are not a doctor or the parent. I wish I could help you, but the only thing I can say is follow your gut. Even though you feel so much uncertainty, you definitely know more about him than anyone else. what grade of IVH does your son have?  I think it was a grade 3 ", "Slight worries Hi all , I have seen a neurological team at my local hospital and they said my VP shunt is fine. But I went in with a dull and sometimes sharp pain around my shunt area (behind right ear) They said its draining fine and not to worry.  And 2 days later I have still got it has anyone else experienced it.. Hi,umm as a person who has had multiple shunts in the past,I can tell you there are going to be unexplained pains that happen now and then.What I usually do is take a mental note of it and see if it gets better or worse.\nThese things usually happen in cycles and will be worse one week and better the other.I have also seen that your bodies position also plays a huge role.\nHope this helps :)\nI think youll be fine :) Thank you im 21 years old and I have had 18 revisions thanks for your rearassurance Goodluck bro,or bro-ette :)\nItll be alright...trust me.Ill shoot a prair up for you...\nHere if you need help. 18!? I am sorry you went through all that. I have had 3 and I feel its enough for a lifetime. I wish I could be of more help but that is concerning. If it keeps up go back to your doctors and insist they check it out further. I know that is pretty weak as support goes but if my wife the RN has taught me anything, it is that insistence often gets you better results. Yeah ive also had like 15+ with complications and shit...It gets a bit rough but it gets better guys &lt;3 I had similar pain and it centralizes around my collarbone too, plus muscle soreness on shunt side. I went to the ER and they did shunt series xrays to check for discontinuity of the tubing (head, chest, and abdomen) and it was fine. They did bloodwork to check for any signs of infection and it was fine. They diagnosed me with a \u201cneck strain\u201d and sent me on my way. I know it is certainly shunt related, but doctors will not bat an eye unless you are throwing up with a fever, etc. Keep a log of all your symptoms and if you can, I would advise getting some bloodwork just for your own peace of mind Omg that is exactly what I had...I slept on a couch for 2 nights and got a sore neck though...so it actually be that And in the end what was it??  Still just trying to get used to the intermittent pain. ER visit was on Friday, been having this feeling for a week now", "How do your hydrocephalus headaches feel?  To me it feels like my brain is going to explode Like someone is pressing on my forehead with a hydraulic press Feels like there is not enough space in my head and my brain is expanding fast. Also the pain is so uncomfortable and intense that usually causes vomiting and fatigue Do the pains in your forehead worsen when you move your head? Like death All the above well... there is the 'overall pressure like everything is expanding' headache, or the 'it feels like a piston the size of a beer can is being pushed directly onto my shunt reservoir' or perhaps the 'drill ripping into the spot where spine and brain meet'.\n\ntake your pick, would not recommend. Like I have vices on both sides pressing inwards \nAnd my jaw is tight and painful \nWhen really bad it is a sharp pain all over as well Not really, no. Now, if I move quickly, yes, but not typically when I move around normally Depends on if my fluid levels are high or low. I feel like my skull is being crushed I cannot see straight I cannot think I can barely move thru some of them it is like getting beat in the head with a sledge hammer by a road raging psychopath I felt like blowing my brains out. That was before I got my first shunt. Painful Hi everyone. I apologize for my hypochondriac questions in advance. I have a tectal plate glioma sitting behind my thalamus. I have my first \u201cwait and see\u201d mri coming up in a couple of weeks. I was told when it was found to be on the look out for blurred or double vision, unsteady gait, and headaches. As I mentioned earlier this diagnosis has turned me into a hypochondriac. I am trying to understand if these vice crushing headaches are mild or are they strong and debilitating?", "Reading Problems (Going to see my ophthalmologist in a couple days but wanted to see if this has happened to anyone else/ anyone has tips)\nSo recently I have been struggling with double vision/cross eyes/ so many names of the problem. I have had it since birth due to the increased icp on my optic nerve making my eyes not look in the same direction. But it has gotten really bad recently to where my eyes are not reading the same line or words are moving (with or without glasses on). I am struggling bc I am trying to read books for college and falling behind. Everything I try has either backfired and given me a headache or flat out not helped at all.\nAnyone have similar issues? When I was 4 years old I had an operation to straighten my left eye that was permanently cross-eyed. I have trouble with reading too.  Whenever possible I try to find audiobooks.  I have optic nerve damage from ICP as well but it resulted in significantly reduced far sight and nystagmus (involuntary shaking of the eyes) this is where my reading issues come in.  I also have trouble remembering what I have just read. Working memory issues. As a kid I would have to read books in school then write reports and discuss deeper meaning in the books.  I pretty much failed these assignments.  It is like most of my mental energy went to the act of reading and not remembering or interpreting. I am having double vision problems. I am 51 and have only had my shunt for hydrocephalus for 9 months. I was over shunted for a couple months and then I got adjusted and ever since then I have been experiencing double vision. My ophthalmologist answer was a prism in my reading glasses. They also did a CT scan for tumors Thank you for info about nystagmus. I noticed my 7yr old daughter eyes starting to do this more and more.", "Just felt the need to post about some of my experiences So I have 3 shunts after 11 brain surgeries. That is one peculiarity about me in the mess that is me. Then another thing is that after the first 6 my tastes changed... For the better. My neurosurgeon has said on multiple occasions that this is generally the opposite of what happens with brain surgery. And while I was in the hospital,nurses asked me \"If I could be anywhere right now,where would it be?\" So,having not seen my beloved pets for months now, I said \"home\". I have been told that I said it in the most pitiful voice,which is believable. I had not been home in a half a year. Just an fyi this occurred in the first long hospital trip, thankfully the longest. And then there was the Ativan trip that terrified both my mother and I. So what happened was I was given some ativan for anxiety (I needed SOMETHING to calm my anxiety, I was a silent mess) and my mom saw me moving in the bed and staring at the corner of the room. She asked what I was doing and why I was staring at the corner. I told her that orange blocks were falling from the ceiling and daddy was in the corner in a trenchcoat. she told me that he was not there and there were no blocks. That is when I freaked tf out, probably panic attack. Wow 3 shunts? Where in the brain are they all? One front left,one front right,and one around my spinal column to fix the cyst that was blocking flow. I often think shock people when they hear just how many shunts I have and I am like: what? Is not that normal for hydrocephalus? Until I remember it is virtually unheard of. Haha yeah I was pretty shocked to hear that you have 3! I have only one. Do you have ongoing symptoms? Not really. The only thing I can think of is anxiety, but that could easily be caused by so many other things that have happened to me.", "Full time psychiatric worker and am exhausted So I had a shunt revision in March 2020. I work full time at a great hospital and finished my degree.\nNow that I am on brain surgery watch due to optic nerve swelling; the medicine I am on makes me tired. So does the mental exhaustion of my job full time. \nI applied nursing school and would need to take my work load down a notch anyway. Is there anyone else with hydro that experiences this? Do you work part time temporarily til u get the job you indefinitely want post op? I do not have hydro, I am a parent of a hydro kid, but I can identify somewhat. I am in school, watching my kid and working. It is exhausting, but I try and tell myself that it is the price to pay to go back to school. Sounds like you have already got a legit job that you should be able to take some pride in and boost yourself up. I cannot speak towards how you feel about a potential issue regarding your optic nerve. I am running on Benadryl to be able to breath and it sure makes it hard to focus. I just do my best to keep a schedule and slot in my high focus items into the time of day when I know I will have the most energy. \n\n\n\nCheck out pell grants and whatever scholarships you can. Talk to your financial aid office and see if they have anything they can help you with. Health care programs usually have more opportunity for aid and grants than general education stuff. Thank you for the insight but I am reaching out to hydrowarriors who are experiencing similar feats. Healthier ppl cannot identify with exactly what I am saying.\nIt is not the financial aid that is getting to me , it is the hydro stress, being brain surgery post op with everything else I did cut my work load when going back to school for my BSN. I know some that did not have to do that, but I seemed really exhausted after my 2nd shunt revision.(I have had 21 revisions since I was first shunted at 30 yrs old. \n\nI think this is normal, and if you can, cut back a little on your work load. Omg and you are an RN?  That is awesome and ahhh I see, so it depends on everyone is body. I have had four brain surgeries ; congenital hydro. I am thinking you and my psychotherapist is right/ my work pad will have to go to part time.\nDid you have to live by yourself during your BSN ? No, I was already married, but my husband was trying to get on SSDI at the time for a uncontrolled seizure disorder....so it was tough on us, it really was. But we made it through. If you have to go back to living with your parents, there is no shame in that you know. I have got hydro, and although I have not had a revision since 07, but I definitely feel it a lot when I have hydro related migraines. The most helpful thing was getting FMLA and taking time off when it hurts too much. Take care of yourself! I am a year and a half surgery free for the first time in my life (I am 29 and have had over 200 revisions). I still find I get tired sometimes for no reason and my brain just fogs up. I am working full time while finishing my PhD thesis. I try my best to be easy on myself and to prioritise my life clearly. I will give up most things for writing my thesis. I will push back some chores to go for a cycle because this helps me stay energised. It is taken me years to get to a point where I can kind of do this though. Before I would just go hard til I crashed. Strong human! Hydrowarriors are the strongest ever. Congrats on the phD", "New Shunt Feeling I am now 25, and I have had my newest shunt for about 3 years now. Within the last day or so, my shunt has been feeling like it did when it was first placed. It does not hurt, I am not disoriented, I do not have any headaches, and I am not vomiting, but it when I move my neck I can feel it more than I usually can. Anyone have experience with this? Should I go to the doctor? Like I said I am not experiencing any symptoms of shunt failure, but this is unusual. Sometimes I get that. Nothing feels wrong, you are just more aware of having something in your body that does not quite belong. I have had the same shunt valve since I was born and I still sometimes get that weird sensation of knowing it exists in my body, no pain, just a sort of acknowledgment. I would not worry about it and eventually the feeling will pass.  That Is exactly what I am talking about! Thanks for the tip, I have a rather scary experience with shunts, so When someone says \"Well, are you having symptoms?\" my first reflex is \"WELL, THAT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING.\" A doctor will not care if you are not symptomatic It is more than likely scar tissue or calcification. I have also noticed when it is colder my shunt feels \u201cstiff\u201d.  haha. Sleeping always makes everything better. The human equivalent of \"have you tried turning it off and back on again?\" I thought that usually hurt more? I have had random sharp pains and stuff and that is what I have been told, but if it is not painful then I do not know if that is it.  Everyone is different. My neck feels like that from time to time and I was told it is scar tissue. The shunt and tubing is a foreign body. Your body will always be trying to walk it off with scar tissue or calcium. It is totally normal. Rub it enough to warm it up it helps.  If I get pain in my tubing, it is usually referred pain and there is some part of my shoulder that I can find and rub that has that hurts-so-good feeling and then it fixes itself. I can press also right where my skull connects to my spine and I can feel it up and down my shunt tubing, but then the pain goes away. I just hate actually feeling the tubing. \n\n&amp;#x200B; Ugh, me too! I am not a particularly delicate person, but I get paranoid about being able to feel my shunt. My last shunt malfunction and revision was a couple of months after I started weekly, full body, deep tissue massage, and I refused to have another one for months afterward. No one and nothing is allowed to go near it. Still feels the same way, but at least nothing is hurting. Also, I am able to stay awake so that is good..although it also means that I could not get to sleep until 3AM. I can hear it occasionally draining, so it does not seem like it is blocked or broken.", "Anyone here with optic nerve damage The damage is caused by Hydrocephalus. \n\nI am seeing an optical neurologist next week for the first time and In one eye I only have decent peripheral vision in one side. I am feeling pretty alone about this and hoping someone can explain what to expect to me and how to move on/forward from this Hi, i had intercranial hypertension about 10 years ago and the increased pressure caused damage to my optic nerve.  I lost peripheral vision in both eyes, and some colour vision. My depth perception is impacted and my night vision, or anything like going from outside sunshine to an inside darker room can take more time than normal to adjust. \n\nYou are not alone! You are amazing and your brain will adapt.  The hard part was learning what had changed because noone could tell me.  I learned my colour vision was impacted when I got lost during a trail race (could not see the orange arrows, and struggled to identify the trail dimensions) when I would been fine previously.  Then I tried to give a speech and learned I could not read from notes anymore - my eyes could not track between notes and the audience and back.  Colour can be hard because I second guess my style and taste more than normal but I learned to be kinder to myself, and stopped wearing so much makeup because it was harder to see subtle changes in tone etc. \n\nSo now i look carefully at my surroundings when running on trails; I learn my material so I give speeches without notes; my skin is better from less make up and I take time when going into a building for my eyes to adjust.  I still have appointments with the ophthalmology team to test my peripheral vision and I am aware when driving I have blind spots so i scan everywhere (I just kept my licence by about 10 degrees of vision)\n\nI hope that helps. You are really not alone.\n\n*edit 10 years ago not 20 Do your eye doctor do anything to help? Is there straight up nothing they can do? I am sorry but in my case there was nothing they could do, I have a shunt to help manage the pressure but the damage is done and it is slow to come out so took about 5 years for them to say \u201cthis is where it is going to sit from now on\u201d. They continue to monitor me to make sure it is not getting worse and that is about it I have lost all peripheral vision on the left side and my hearing is going just as quick on that side. My heart is with you friend, stay strong as you are able to My hearing has become more sensitive for me strangely. Things sound louder When I woke up after my  last valve replacement my hearing was so sensitive I kicked my family out into the hall for breathing too loud \ud83d\ude05 So your hearing was more sensitive and now it is going? Are you going deaf? Immediately after the first surgery and before the second. Everything hurt and I felt like I could \"feel sounds\" with my entire body, any sound was very loud. After the 2nd much more invasive surgery to fix something they did in my head that they were not even supposed to I have begun losing hearing in my left ear as well as the eye unfocussing almost hourly. However, the doctor says there is nothing wrong so", "Hopeful about Shunt Adjustment Does anyone have the ProSA shunt assistant with a high setting near or at the max of 40? Curious if you had it at 36 or lower initially then moved it up and your symptoms improved. My wife is seeing our neurosurgeon soon and currently has ProSA setting of 36 with what seems to be signs of over draining when standing. Hoping this helps her as she has to remain supine most hours of the day. does it actually help? I have been wondering about having one put in Are you asking about the shunt assistant or the shunt itself? The ProSA allows more control over pressure while upright vs a shunt alone. My understanding is pressure is different depending on position. My concern with my wife\u2019s situation is that she is almost at the max setting and I do not know what can be done if the max setting does not help. The shunt assistant\nI know this is stupid to say but I would try to get an appointment with her neurologist pretty soon and talk to them.", "Malfunctions What are your signs of a malfunction? I know they are different for everyone I have been really lucky with my 1981-vintage VP shunt; my only malfunction was a long time ago (1997), and I had a calcium barb form around the end of the peritoneal catheter; felt like it was poking me as I would breathe. \n\nNever thought I would be grateful for my Atari-level-technology giant shunt, but I think that is what is kept it working all this time. I had a shunt put in when I was 6 months. It broke in a few days. I had 2 more in a short time. That lasted until I was 5 I and had to have it revised. That lasted until February 14, 2019. I had a seizure March 14 2019. That lasted until October 17th 2019 and I am still adjusting. I went from a 1997 valve to a codman programmable valve Dang. Hope this one works out. I am having trouble with it. I had to have it adjusted but idk if it is working People are told to watch for headaches, blurry vision, dizziness, loss of balance, and vomiting \n\nNever had a true malfunction but a brain bleed that went along with enlarged ventricles ... signs all looked like a stroke (trouble speaking, weakness on my one side, some facial drooping) as well as the vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, and headache \n\nIdk even after hearing to watch for the signs I still could not recognize it on myself - luckily the people I was with called an ambulance I had a seizure and woke up to my boyfriend on the phone with 911 and my grandma. (He had both of our phones) the first thing I said when I woke up and realized what happened was \u201ccall my momma\u201d she made a 5 hour drive in 3 hours and was there in time for my surgery I usually get bad headaches, vomitting, burry vision, and dizziness. I get that too before it gets super bad Ouch not fun. Hope ur better: I have my days but we are working on it I feel ur pain. I punched my gf once in my sleep while sleep scratch I g my shunt cuz it hurt. I injured her but she was more worried about me then her injured body. We luckily dodged a bullet though. By pure luck we dodged a bullet. When we checked in morning all I had was a infection. But she had bruises from me scratching, After that my arms were always around her at night. If I did not place them around her at night I was in big trouble cuz I was bound to Open up my scars cuz I almost did once. Passed out that time scared the crap out of her doing that. Am I proud of that? Not really. I do not sleep punch I used to sleep walk my mom told me cuz one time I went to sleep in my room and woke up on the couch. She said I walked out of the house and my dad had to get me. Apparently I kick in my sleep cuz my boyfriend always tells me This last surgery my stitches came loose but it was ok cuz they were going to take them out soon anyway Well I did sleep talk to my gf. I told her I loved her,shut up I am talking,my head hurts,I am sorry for telling you shut up. And I did kick once, same night I had a nightmare and she was crying in the morning all bruised and bloody(my blood not hers,in my nightmare I ended up cutting my arm it got all over her during the night. Luckily it was small cut. But she is tough. She forgave me for injuring her though I had to hold her. When we later found out I had somthing like a seizure but not really like it, due to nightmare Ouch. I told my gf. If I ever get surgury you will be the last face I see and first face. I do not want to see the nurosurgon face at all I hate surgeries. And I told her if I get surgury to make sure my hospital stay is short. Having a Puerto Rican girlfriend is amazing they get shit done but can have a protective attatude I have never done that. Seizures yes but no bleeding I like my surgeons I have 3 and my stats are 2 days to 2 weeks long I do not cuz all they do is fix me then pass the visits to staff Lucky. I bleed easy. So when I see my woman I get 2 options taped hands at night or hold her all night.", "Our little 2.5 month old after his second shunt surgery (first revision)  It took a solid 1.5 months after his first surgery before the doctors listened to me that his head was still getting bigger.

I need to know I am not alone! Not a nurse, but hoping to have a career in medicine (biochem student right now). You are definitely not alone! Mine is congenital as well, though it was caused by an obstruction and was operated on to the point it was deemed 90% fixed That is awesome. I was considering being a physician assistant too. I am graduating with my Bs in psych this month,  praying I get a math waiver to complete it. Mines was caused by a brain bleed. \nHow many surgeries have you had? Going to nursing school is something that you probably can do without too much hassle.\n\n I have been a RN since 1974. (I am retired now). I first worked in Neurosurgery. I actually was not shunted until I was 30 yrs old. I had a few health issues that no doctor in the late 50's until 1980 could figure out. I would been taken to several doctors and to major hospital clinics over the years, but until CT-scans came along, the primary doctor I had just kept telling my parents (and my husband after we were married in 1974) that they did not know what was wrong, a possibility was I had a slight case of CP....and of course they had no clue about my severe Nystagmus either! \n\nI was a good student in school (Elementary, thru HS) and probably would have graduated closer either 1st or 2nd of my class but I endured years of bullying and while I got good grades, school was a nightmare. While I hated school the drive to get good grades stemmed from the bullying I am sure.\n\nI had no issues with the academics in college at all. I took college prep courses for nursing while in HS as well.\n\n Still I got my RN degree with stellar grades and when on to get my BSN. If you have had a lot of issues due to your Hydro, you might want to think of a career that is not so fast-paced perhaps, although I spent the first 10 yrs of my career working in large hospital's ER. I then went into Labor &amp; Delivery. My last 6 yrs I worked in Neurosurgery.\n\nAs I got older, the headaches got worse and the vomiting was even worse. I decided to take an early retirement which I am so glad I did. I was able to spend the last 10 yrs 24/7 with my husband who became disabled due to a difficult to control seizure disorder. It was amazing I was able spend those last few years with him.\n\nGood luck....if you are not having tons of issues due to Hydro, I would say go for it....if it takes you 1-2 yrs longer than the average  person that does not have hydro, that is okay. I did not have to take any time off during college, in fact I did not take the summers off ....which I preferred. Two, I believe. Have not had any since I was two years old, I believe Not a nurse, but I have worked in healthcare since 2015 (26 f) with congenital as well. If you do not have frequent shunt issues, I would say go for it! It has not held me back at all career wise. I did not have problems until 2017. \nI just had my fourth brain surgery in March for a non programmable shunt and am in online college. I am praying that I can finish nursing school to work in neurosurgery and go on missions. Awesome!  And I am going for it Hope the best for you. Take care.", "New to forum I (22F) was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus late 2019 in St George\u2019s Hospital, London. It came as a shock if I am being honest, I was the passenger in a nasty car accident the February before and was extremely lucky. I had bruising to my knees and whiplash but that was all. Two weeks later I started fainting, not losing consciousness entirely, but mostly the room would spin, my head would feel heavy, body disoriented and I would often fall down. I have no history of headaches, migraines or fainting before this accident- other than when iron levels were low but I knew this was different. My GP diagnosed me with anaemia (which I already had and took supplements for). I was reluctant to pursue further out of fear of what could be wrong. I often overthink so I just trusted my GP and told myself it would be ok. \n\nIt was not ok. The day I called NHS 111 I was at University in my third year of my degree. It was 7 months after my accident and 1 month after my 21st birthday. I lost sight in one eye and feeling of my left side. I fainted more than 60 times that day. I also had other various side effects like vomiting, heaviness behind my eyes and in my neck. After 24 hrs in a&amp;e for a \u2018headache\u2019 I received the news and was sent to St George\u2019s the next day for diagnosis and treatment. \n\nI have found it really hard knowing I have randomly got this shunt in my body and there is no real cure. While I am incredibly lucky in the fact I have only had the one surgery, managed to live semi-normally afterwards and still achieve a 2:1 in my degree- I suffer greatly from Chronic Migraines due to the trauma of the neurosurgery. I also have had fluctuating hormones and weight changes since surgery. I was told not to eat before the surgery which took days to happen due to other emergencies occurring in the hospital at the same time. Because of this, I left hospital at 7st 5-8lb (the skinniest and most unhealthy I have ever been). Also, due to the pandemic I have also really not been given any clear advice about my health condition and it makes me feel very isolated. \n\nIve been told the swelling/fluid build up was caused by the car accident yet another neurologist claims it is congenital. Ive been told that there is a blockage in my spinal cord and brain but test results do not indicate it to be anything serious. They described it to be membrane blocking the fluid from normally draining down my spine ??? I have been told that the brain swelling may have been there for years and may have concealed my migraines. That the new low pressure has made the symptoms more noticeable. I feel that most of this information is very conflicting. \n\nAll in all, I take strong meds for the migraines and I am in chronic pain most weeks. It can be quite scary as these symptoms feel often very similar to the initial symptoms of hydrocephalus (pre-op).\n\nDoes anyone have similar symptoms/diagnosis? I have not met anyone yet who has gone through this and more specifically got a diagnosis in adulthood. It would be nice to share thoughts/experiences. \n\nTLDR\nNeurosurgeons diagnosed me with hydrocephalus after extensive testing in St George\u2019s in early adulthood and since my brain surgery I have suffered with chronic migraines, hormonal/weight changes (mostly losing lots of weight and I am only 5\u201d4 8st 3lb). Looking for advice and to meet people like me :) ( Welcome to the club, I was diagnosed as an adult with obstructive hydrocephalus (I have an inoperable mass in my brainstem), I did not do anything about it for 8 years until I could not walk or talk and was having trouble thinking.  Got my VP shunt put in in November and I am still recovering (it takes time), the Hydrocephalus Association has local Facebook groups that you can check out for meet ups, and the people on this sub are pretty good at answering questions, I find that people with our condition are better to talk to about it because they understand it and the older heads will have good advice, again welcome This makes sense to me. I guess I was given a lot of false hope in hospital. I was told that my recovery would take less than 3-7 days and that I would return to normal health straight away. But this just did not happen and I have been doubting EVERYTHING since. I agree, it is definitely better getting advice from others with the condition. I did not know of the FB group, how lovely Hey there! We have pretty similar stories. I am a 24F from London and I was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus in August of last year after having had symptoms for about 9/10 months. \n\nLike you, I had an accident that resulted in me having whiplash but I did not think anything of it. Soon after the accident I started having really bad high pressure headaches, vision loss, intense nausea and constant murmuring in my ears. I went to the doctors and was also told that I was anaemic and that the symptoms I was experiencing were related to that. \n\nMy symptoms got progressively worse while I was doing my Master\u2019s and I eventually forced my doctor to send me for a CT scan of my head. They found that my ventricles were very large and sent me for emergency surgery. \n\nThe first surgery I had was an ETV. I was sent home 2 days after surgery and everything was fine for about a week. I then started experiencing CSF dripping from my wound. Went back to hospital and had another emergency surgery to get a shunt placed. During that surgery, they took a sample of my CSF and found out the next day that it was infected. \n\nLong story a little less long, I was in hospital for a month after that and had 5 more surgeries. My last surgery was to have another shunt placed and thankfully everything is fine now. \n\nIt is a very unique thing we experience but warm welcome! :) How long ago was your surgery?  What type of shunt do you have?  The reason I ask is because after my surgery I was still having all of my pre-op symptoms but worse, I reported it to my neurosurgeon about a month after surgery and they had me come in, I have a VP shunt so it is programmable with a magnetic device externally.  They adjusted my shunt from 2.0 to 1.5 and within 30 minutes everything went away and felt better then I have felt in years, the pressure in my head went away, I felt it drain like a clogged sink, talk to your neurosurgeon and find out about your shunt and settings It is a very similar experience, thank you for sharing. I was actually readmitted to hospital last March for a revision surgery due to \u2018low pressure headaches\u2019 but it was cancelled the morning of as my consultant was not 100% sure. My anxiety comes from having to go through it all again mostly due to the horrible possible risks of brain surgery. I am sorry to hear you had numerous surgeries in a short amount of time! That cannot have been easy. \n\nAlso, have you considered what happens when/if we have children? I would like to have children some day and I am not sure if I can anymore (as I would not want to pass this on to my children and obviously there is risks for a shunted mother to carry a child). What are your thoughts? My surgery was in October 2019. I have a fixed pressure VP shunt set to high. My first question was \u201cwould not it be better to be low-medium or a shunt where you can adjust the pressure so I can accustom to the normal pressure???\u201d. \n\nBut unfortunately I reacted quite horribly to the lumbar puncture. When they drained the fluid initially (all was well it was clear and fine) my pressure fell from upwards of 28 to 15 and I started feeling extreme nausea and shaking. My surgeon said that the pressure was so high for so long that my normal pressure is a little higher than the norm. Generally I would been producing a high amount of fluid so the highest setting would be best long term. In all fairness, I have had one checkup since my surgery and they said everything is working really well. \n\nDue to the migraines that they thought were \u2018low pressure headaches\u2019 (which meant the shunt was draining too much fluid) they booked a revision surgery to get the programmable shunt. This was cancelled the morning of my surgery as my consultant was not 100% sure it was the right thing to do. My ventricles were normal so they were reluctant to change to the programmable shunt because of the migraines, JUST in case it is an unrelated condition - ie the shunt is working and doing its job so they did not want to mess with that until the migraines become an everyday occurrence. Hopefully this makes sense \ud83d\ude06 Ahh, I am really sorry your surgery was cancelled. Is your shunt programmable? If so, has your consultant said anything about maybe changing the setting on your shunt to make it drain less instead of having surgery? My consultant told me that low pressure headaches are often associated with the shunt possibly draining CSF too much. \n\nI was actually having this conversation with my Mum the other day - from what I have been told, hydrocephalus is not genetic. Experts are still investigating though, so we do not know definitively. If it does turn out to be genetic then I do not think I would want to have kids (although I have ALWAYS wanted to have them.) I just do not think it would be fair to pass that on to an innocent child/children and possibly subject them to some of the hardships I have been through. \n\nHowever, I have read loads of stories of women that have hydrocephalus and shunts who have gone on to have multiple healthy children and had pretty normal pregnancies. So I am going to keep the hope that I can still have healthy kids who will not have the condition and experience an easy-ish pregnancy! Makes complete sense, sorry you have to go through this, I am still new to all of this and hoping my terrible headaches do not come back (fingers crossed).  Playing devils advocate have you ruled out sinus or tooth infection?  I used to get bad migraines when I had and infected tooth that was cracked, it is how we originally found out I had a mass in my brain. I am sorry we both had to go through this! Oh my gosh, it is crazy how things work out right? So did you have an X-ray for your tooth or something which revealed the mass? \n\nI had a similar thing, when I called 111 they basically told me to get some rest. As all my blood pressure/ heart rate etc was ok they were not too concerned. Towards the end of their assessment I told them I had not urinated in over 24 hours and had a bad headache and that is why they took me to A&amp;E - where I had the CT scan and found the brain swelling. I had really bad cluster headaches for years and we could not figure out why, it was a tooth infection and the hydrocephalus combined, we found the mass after a CT scan 8 years ago Unfortunately my VP shunt is fixed pressure so I cannot adjust unless they revise it to the programmable (which they almost did but that was cancelled as you know). \n\nI think I am going to agree with you there, I would struggle to have children of my own if they were to be born with the condition. I am an adopted child so that could be an option for me but who knows- fingers crossed it is not genetic. Perhaps there is prenatal tests that can assess if the foetus has the condition? Though I have not heard anything about this. It is all so vague online! Oh wow, that does not sound very pleasant. I do have a wisdom tooth growing through at a weird uncomfortable angle so that may be causing some headaches. But the migraines are just idk different? They are simply unbearable. Ive been recording a migraine diary since March to see how they fluctuate so it is unlikely to be due to the tooth unfortunately. Fingers crossed the meds I am trialling prevent the frequent migraines I am having. But I am glad you managed to find the treatment that works great for you! Hey - I am a fellow St. George's outpatient! I have had hydrocephalus and a shunt since I was 10 months old in 1991 and it was due to a tumour (I was treated at the Atkinson Moreley Hospital in Wimbledon then - the wing at St George's replaced it in 2002). \n\nYou can read my comments history for what is happened since, but basically I went 16 years with no revisions until in my teens I had symptoms very similar to yours, and, like with you, they do not seem to know for sure what changed to cause the symptoms. I am currently at 9 years since my last surgery (I have had 9 related to the shunt).\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions you think I might be able to help with! I was diagnosed late, but not quite that late at 12 years old.  My pathology is aqueductal stenosis though, purely congenital from what the neurologists think. I did not have anything when I was younger but recently got an ETV and had symptoms after that persisting for a few months that felt somewhat endocrine, things like feeling a bit overly fatigued, and having weird sweats.  No headaches continued after my surgery, but the changes can vary. Keep in touch with your GP though, they should be kept privy to those symptoms. Good luck and keep us updated Hey! 9 years since the last is very good ... at least in my opinion. I guess the most difficult part of it for me is not being given definitive answers. I think the only way I am going to get them is by suffering with the symptoms for a while and learning what works/does not work for my body. But Thankyou for sharing :) Unfortunately, yes, it is a lot of just getting used to it! What was weird for me is that I know no different so there were things I thought everyone had for years, like getting a headache and the pumping sensation  from bending down to tie my laces. Ah the joys of brain surgery! Actually, I have experienced something strange since the surgery- every time there is been a storm (thunder and lightning) around 10 minutes before it starts- my ears start popping, ears buzzing and I get a little dizzy! I find it cool Thanks for sharing! I have had similar symptoms which I put down to hormonal imbalance as I am on the contraceptive pill. I changed my pill and now I am ok but due to the surgery and migraines I am thinking of coming off the pill ASAP. Definitely crucial to keep up to date with doctors That seems to be a common thing lots of people with shunts experience! I have only ever seen neurosurgeons and scientists say there is no evidence, but I definitely think we are more sensitive to air pressure changes. For me, it feels like something is lightly pressing down on the back of my head, there is a little pressure behind and above my eyes and I get a sort of muffled 'buzzing' in my ears (I am using your word as it is pretty close to it, but it is difficult to describe!)", "Old tech=better? Hi, I had a previous non programmable vp shunt from 1984 until 2020 and never had any problems. Then in 2020 it finally broke and they gave me 2 new programmable vp shunts.\n\nI have had nothing but problems with them! It would take me way too long to list all my problems but I am less than 2 years in and already I am in for my 4th revision with these new shunts.\n\nYou know that washer/dryer your parents have had since the 80s or the refrigerator your grandparents have had since the 70s that will outlast the heat death of the universe?\n\nThat is how I feel about my body. It is so annoying that this supposedly superior technology has caused me so many problems in such a short period of time. I flippin flippin hear you and it just sucks. \n\nAnd we cannot ask for the old ones because they are not longer within the standard of care I would ask your neurosurgeon why they chose a programmable shunt because not all new patients get them. Maybe your symptoms changed or they anticipated a change. My kids surgeon has always told us he liked the simple non programmable ones if they worked purely for the fact that it is less to go wrong. Are your shunts malfunctioning or is it the catheter? In this most recent surgery they replaced one of the the shunt catheters but not the shunt itself Same! I got my first shunt in 1995 due to a brain tumor.  My shunt tube broke off in my neck in 2015 and they replaced the whole thing. They replaced it with a new, non-programmable shunt.\n\nFast forward to 2019, my shunt fails again, this time I had a psuedocyst and a really bad brain infection.  After two weeks in ICU they replaced my old shunt with a programmable one.  I absolutely **HATE** it.  I have headaches anytime the barometric pressure changes.  It really sucks. I hear you man.... That sucks I just wish I could get a non-programmable one that is set to the programmable setting I have been living comfortably with for a decade. If I am not going to get it programmed again, then I do not want to have to deal with all of the hassle of avoiding metal detectors and MRIs.", "How does hydro affect you? I have had both hydrocephalus and cerebral palsy since birth so tbh apart from migraines and early puberty, idk how else it affects me since I have had it my whole life so I would not really be able to tell if I had memory deficits etc. I was born with hydrocephalus and had my 1st shunt installed at 28 days old.  I, like you, do not know life without it.  I know my childhood neurologist said it impacted my balance, which is probably why I was never able to learn to ride a bike. (I am 48 years old.)  Other than that, I really do not know how it has changed my life.  HOWEVER, I have lived the past 20 years with a shunt that was not working, and it was never caught because it was believed I had outgrown my condition, so, years of headaches and back pain were dismissed as sinus headaches and bad luck.  In 2017 I lost my vision and it was determined my shunt had failed so I had it replaced.  Now, again, other than my blindness, I really do not know how it has impacted my life. I have had hydro since birth. I have had 30 revisions in 30 years. Over time, I can tell that my memory is being effected. In high school, I was able to easily make A\u2019s and B\u2019s in all of my classes. Now, working and also still going to school, I am struggling to pass my classes with C\u2019s and D\u2019s. I have to study for longer periods of time and write nearly everything down (future plans in the week) so that I do not forget them. I have had hydro since birth, I am 16 with no revisions. It is effected my vision, early puberty, wacky depth perception, migraines. I have definitely been more affected mentally than physically. I have noticed I am very paranoid, I think about my shunt malfunctioning basically every day. I also seem to have pending doom mentality, I fully think i am not going to make it out of my first revision, whenever that happens.", "PLEASE HELP! 11year old niece and possible shunt failure Started Saturday night- out of nowhere she said she got kind of light headed. Few second later she is screaming,puked grabbed the side of her shunt. Came home in pain tried to sleep it off.\n \nSunday-went to Vanderbilt hospital critical care. \nX-ray could not find shunt \nMRI found shunt-doctors said it was fine.\nThey did not reprogram shunt after MRI as dr said it was not needed.\nAlso said her optical nerves were swollen eye pressure in left 19 eye pressure in right 16(shunt side)\nMonday-went to doctor Monday nothing was done she is complain about a headache in front of head and left to shunt(all right side)\n\nTuesday-Wednesday(her neck&amp;back is swollen,whole right side of her face is swollen all around her shunt. \n\nAny help is great! Go elsewhere and fast. That is a definite sign of failure. Maybe the tubing broke and it is leaking out, which would cause the swelling. Optic nerve swelling is also a big sign of shunt failure, and if the shunt is not fixed it could lead to permanent vision problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I agree with serotonin, she needs to be seen immediately.  Did they say the ventricles look fine? I am confused about the MRI situation. Like, they could not find the physical device or they could not find anything wrong?  \n\nAlso, puking is another big sign of failure because somehow that reduces pressure inside the skull when there is too much fluid.  They just could not find any of the shunt on the X-ray. X-ray technician came in and ask where it was because the could not find/see it. You can literally feel it and see it on her. how can you not find it on an X-ray? \n\nBut found it when they did the MRI and the doctor said the shunt was fine. You should probably get a second opinion, especially with all those other symptoms (and because they did not seem too competent since they could not find what they could physically feel!).  VP Shunt?  Cannot a broken tube cause swelling due to CSF pooling near crack/breakage?  Front headache has always been sinusitis in our case, but the rest sound like definite failure symptoms.  Please, I hope you can go somewhere else tonight!  When things settle I would love to hear what it is and how she is doing.   I once went in and nothing was caught on the xrays either, had to got to a seperate hospital. Jumping on the advice of everyone else, get into the hospital!\n\nSending positive vibes! ***UPDATE***\n\nWent to ER this morning \n\nNow going home until the doctor talks to neurology and the eye institute.\n\nAlso said she has tenderness in the shunt tube track which could mean a leak. But without \u201cother signs they cannot say its shunt failure\u201d\n\nI am sorry but vomiting is not a \u201csign\u201d\nSwelling of the face head should neck is not a sign? Headaches are not a sign?\n\nI am at a loss for words here.\n If she has had a neuro she is seen before, even when she was younger, you could try getting her in with them on the schedule, then going to the emergency room of the hospital the neurosurgeon works from after getting on the schedule, if it is not quick enough.\n\nI had a problem similar to this when I was 18. I got an old pediatric neurosurgeon I had when I was 10 to put me on the schedule to look at it. I ended up with the pain being so bad that I went to the ER there, and they admitted me and ended up scheduling the surgery to take my very broken shunt out and give me an ETV for 9 am the next morning. \n\n The shunt probably calcified and snapped in her neck. I know how the pain and the swelling feels. It was unbearable, and relentless, and I am so sorry that she has to go through this, because it absolutely sucks. \n\nFor before getting surgery:\n\nWhen this happened to me, all that helped was laying in bed in a dark room and trying to just sleep through it.\n\nI think also what might have made the pain worse was that my muscles in my neck and at the base of my skull were really tight. It was explained to me that there are two sort of lines of muscle on the back of your neck, and when they tighten because of the pain you have, it makes it worse because it tightens around other nerves. If those muscles are tight, it might help to massage them or roll them out with a bouncy ball. If she is having pain from this, this might help.\n\nFor the pressure pain, if it is worse after laying down, she is got higher pressure. Try to keep her sitting more upright or at least inclined. \n\nIf it is better after laying down, but worse when she gets up, that is probably low pressure. Keep her laying down as much as possible. \n\nI would not wish this pain on my worst enemy. If you cannot get this fixed, or get her functional pretty quickly, I might try to talk to her school about some sort of medical leave of absence. I was in my sophomore year of college when this happened to me, and I lost a semester because of it. My daughter had xrays and an mri done for a potential shunt failure that came back fine. 48 hours later we were back in the er got another round of xrays and mris that showed enlarged ventricles and the need for a revision. It is interesting how the symptoms of shunt failure can present themselves prior to the physical enlargement of the ventricles showing up on scans. One caveat was that our neurologist reviewed all scans and was not happy with the clairity of the images. My take away, that echos our NICU staff, is parents know more about their child / patient than the doctors sometimes. Also, having good clean imaging done and readily available of your healthy brain is a invaluable resource. Know what your happy brain looks like and be an ardent advocate for treatment when you know something is wrong.  Techs are not doctors and while they do their best some are better than others. I have seen bad scans before when there was an actual problem.  Absolutely! Over that revision and the following, I came to the understanding that my ventricles do not show change at this point, thus a usual sign for neurologists is kaput. She needs a CT scan. They show the best detail with the shunt and the tubing. \n\nShe is showing typical signs of shunt failure. I am curious to if she is seeing a neurosurgeon. A neurologist is not what she needs and most GPS know zip about hydrocephalus. \n\nI would go as far as trying another hospital. \n\nDo not take no for an answer. You are her voice and you are her best advocate. Ask for a shunt series and maybe even ask them to take fluid out of the shunt tract to check for any infection.  Update\nThank you all for you input.\nDoctors did nothing at all and just kept saying she did not have enough signs of shunt failure.\nBut she is doing better now.", "How likley are unintentionally setting changes of adjustable shunts? Hello,\n\ni guess most people today get adjustable shunts inserted. Some of those shunts have locking mechanisms which should prevent unintentioned changes in their setting, however many shunts do not have a locking mechanism, they could be changed in their setting by magnets.\n\nDoes anyone know if its\n\n\\- ok to use clippers for a haircut\n\n\\- ok to use earphones, especially in-ear headphone? Yes and yes. Earphones or headphones? Both should be fine. Thank you for this question! I am getting an adjustable VP shunt on Tuesday and was wondering the same thing. I had heard about iPads and airport security screening from similar posts. I think you should be good to do both of those things. I would advise you to double check with your neurologist when it comes to the magnets stuff though cos your particular shunt may be different. \n\nI had similar questions around getting an iPhone 12 (because of the magnets) and asked my neurosurgeon - he said it was absolutely fine. He told me that the magnets they use for my particular shunt are very powerful and not even a 2T MRI machine could change the setting. So yeah, double check. I wish you all the best for the surgery. May i ask if it is your first shunt or a revision? In both cases i hope you will do well afterwards! Thanks a lot. Here in Germany it seems that one of the most often used shunts is the Codman Medos Hakim. As much as i know it has no locking mechanism and its necessary to check the setting after MRIs. No it is the first surgery, not a revision.", "Hydrocephalus and Aging My last shunt revision was two years ago at the age of 22. My doctor told me that most revisions happen before a person is done growing, and are much less likely with age. Is this true? Has anyone heard anything to the contrary? I had my last one at 8 yo due to scar tissue around the cord coil. I am 26 now. When I was in the hospital back then there was a 70+ year old on my floor getting a revision. \n\nIt is all up to chance IMO. My doc told me the same when I was about eight after I would had my 10th revision since birth. Since then I have had rounds of revisions much further apart, at ages 16, 23, and 35. I am now 41 and my current shunt is still going strong. I am 30 and had my first at 3 months, and then my second (also my last) at age 5 when there was a blockage. So I still have an old-school shunt - the manual press and see how long it takes to refill. The neurosurgeons I have seen have said they think I do not need it anymore but that the only reason to remove it would be cosmetic. They mentioned that it is unlikely to cause me problems but of course to keep an eye on it. The neurosurgeon told me that 1/3 of kids need a revision before age two. There is enough abdominal tubing though that height and growth should not be factors. I think it is just a coin flip.  Okay from what I have heard, they have a high failure rate after like 5 years. I got one in 2010, then needed a revision in 2014. 18 yr old to 22. It also depends on your activity level. I skate, surf, rock climb, crossfit, etc. and I guess those activities can fuck it up.  I have had my first shunt for 18 years now. I am 26 so who knows. I think it all depends on the individual and the shunt. I am 38 and had my last lot of revisions in 1990. I am hoping, as you are, not to have to go through that crap again :) I am 50 and my last shunt was placed during the Nixon administration, when I was 6. My last distal tube revision was when I was 11. No problems since then.", "Is it possible to not need a shunt later in your life? Think if heard of people getting shunts removed when they are older", "Just a curious question So about a year or so ago my mother had convinced me to try a little bit of weed with her, it never really had any effects on her other than calming her down. But when I had tried it, I do not remember anything at all from afterwards other than walking to my room. She said the type of weed was not strong enough to give memory loss like I had and it had never happened when her or her dad had tried it. Has any shunted person ever had that kind of effect, and if so will it keep happening or does it eventually stop? I have not had much of an experience like this back when I was shunted, though I will say weed can sometimes have some funny effects on first-time users.  I definitely felt it pretty hard the first time I tried weed, and though I did not get that effect it might not be far from expectations. I have not. But are you on meds by chance, or consume alcohol? You say back when you were shunted, does this mean yours was taken out? If so, does that also mean your hydrocephalus was corrected? Yes and yes. When you receive an ETV the flow has a natural path, and while they do sometimes leave shunts in as a redundancy in case the ETV seals back. In my case the shunt was blocked though, so they just removed it and performed the ETV. MRI shows that the flow is good and the ventricles are in good shape, so it is looking all clear! Congrats! I just had a revision due to a malfunctioning shunt, but the surgeon said it may be time to remove mine as well. Fingers crossed. Cool! ETV is a good surgery, but of course only works for some. I hope your shiny works though, best to stay out of surgery! I used to be on meds and I do not consume alcohol Maybe your mom has a higher tolerance, do you smoke often? I have a lot of experience with weed and I have noticed I have a lower tolerance than my friends (or used to haha) i usually attribute it to my bad lungs taking in more ??  Idk I do not, after that time I was a little afraid since I got picked on for the things I said when I do not remember I think it is a new smoker thing, I have asked a neurosurgeon before if it is ok if I keep smoking after a brain bleed and they said I can live my life how I want and that it will not effect CSF at all It can hit you pretty hard if you are a first timer. I do not think it has anything to do with hydrocephalus, you probably just got a little too high. Different effects happen to different people.", "Headaches upon standing at the end of the day? I have a non-programmable VP shunt, originally placed in 1981, revised once in 1996. I have an office job, where about 1/2 my job is desk work, and the remainder of it is in an indoor, clean workplace, with standing, bending, all that. \n\nI get headaches sometimes that I have had difficulty getting answers on. They typically happen at the end of the day, 4:30-6ish. It is just after I have been sitting, either driving or at my desk. \n\nThey come on suddenly, and it only lasts 10-15 minutes. Intense pressure, simultaneously, on both my eyes, as if someone were pressing on them with their thumbs from inside my head.  I usually see a thin ring around the center of my vision in both eyes, similar to the aftereffect of a bright light\u2014 that phosphene shimmer\u2014 that pulses in time to my heartbeat. Usually makes me sweat at the end, and my back tenses up between my shoulders. \n\nI have read about _spontaneous intracranial hypotension_, and much of that sounds familiar. I had a headache doctor once mention \u2018siphoning headaches\u2019 and positional causes of headaches. \n\nAnyone else ever have this sort of headache?

Most likely overdrainging.  This happens to a high percentage.  Your vents can be slit, which are not good. I would get a check up.  Make sure it is nothing seizurish Thank you. I will investigate the overdrainage situation. I appreciate the help. I experience the same thing! While I would not describe my headaches exactly the same way, I get them if I have been sitting most of the day. My neurologist thought it could be overdrainage and recommended laying down flat for a bit when I get the headache but also laying down during the day if I have been or will be sitting all day. I too have an office job where I sit 99% of the time- if I feel a headache coming on I try to lay in my car during lunch for a bit and it has actually helped a lot!", "Discord or other online groups? Laundry list of neurological problems here wondering if there are any like, online Hydrocephalus support groups. I cannot really go outside a lot, let alone to however far the closest one might be, if one even exists near me. Are there any places online? Discords, forums, whatnot. This Sub could work but I feel like there is a very different type of stuff that goes on each.\n\nSorry if this has been asked before, the only post I could find has been deleted. There are many FB groups and several here as well. I do not do discord or Telegram short of my game ( i play a live online game) communication. There are a ton of FB groups most of them are made up of parents with young kids with hydrocephalus( with a few adult members as well) I have found this group to be really helpful. \n\nThe one thing to keep in mind is that everyone one has different experiences with hydrocephalus. So you can learn and grow from any group.\n\nFor instance , I am not really limited at all with what I cannot do ( minus crazy roller coasters) . So seeing everyone else\u2019s experiences with this sheds a whole new light on the condition for me. It also makes me really great full to interact and learn from everyone In my opinion the Facebook support groups are full of people overseas posting go fund new and general bitching about symptoms but not willing to go to the doctor. I left them all. \n\nThere is honestly not many good support groups for our disease. There  used to be a group called Hyceph-L. It was a listserv and University of Missouri was also involved. I do not remember all the particulars, but a man by the name of Don Cook started it YEARS ago. I belonged to it for several years. When Don Cook died, a man connected with the college (not sure if it was the guy or his child that had hydro). I think the demise of the group came when other social media sites came about....such as FB, etc.\n\nContact the Hydrocephalus Association. Maybe they can point you in the right direction for a group you might enjoy.\n\nLastly, Don Cook worked hard to get the group out there.....and it showed. He was absolutely awesome, helped a lot of scared parents that received a diagnosis of Hydrocephalus for their child. He really helped adults too. Years ago, I was contacted by the President of the Hydrocephalus Foundation, to take over her job, but I had just went through several surgeries within a 55 day period and a year after that, lost my husband too (not from hydrocephalus though he died from an ER doctor's neglect) Again, I would contact the Hydrocephalus Association to see what they have. I have had decent experiences in fb groups, but the ones for people with hydrocephalus seem a bit more quiet. Seems like from these replies that right now it is just FB groups, then?", "My journey with hydrocephalus Hello, I am new to this group. I wanted to share my story related to hydrocephalus and ask if anyone else here has experienced similar challenges. \n\nI discovered that I have hydrocephalus at the age of 8 years old. Thereafter, I was admitted into hospital and  underwent surgery to insert a shunt that will drain cerebrospinal fluid from my head. Was discharged but the following year, I had to be readmitted and undergo more surgeries at the age of 9. \n\nThe challenges that I have faced are: \n-low self esteem because for a long time I wished that I was normal but I have come to accept myself with my condition. I am still working on loving myself 100% though.\n\n-being slow, hands shake all the time, poor balance.\n\n-mental illnesses which include anxiety, depression, cptsd (not sure about this, I might have it at the moment), OCD. \n\nOne thing I have need to add is that I have grown up in an emotionally abusive home. \n\n- I have also struggled to make friends and start dating. I have greatly improved in my social skills so I have been able to form healthy friendships but sometimes the friendships do not feel extremely fulfilling. I think it is because I have a hard time communicating my feelings to other people and I have a tendency to bottle things up.  I do not have many friends which is something I do not have a problem with. The problem comes in when I am trying to make new friends and at times I feel like I am not as important to them as they are to me. Most of my friendships eventually fade as much as I believed the friendship was genuine.\n\nI believe communicating my feelings would go a long way in making things better for me though. \n\nFeedback would be highly appreciated.

I seem to suffer from the same problems and acquired hydrocephalus last year after a brain bleed from complications from surgery. I applaud you for being so strong, as I know this has been the most challenging time of my 28 year life. Nothing but good wishes for you going forward. Thank you so much for the kind words and for your response too. I hope that you get through this difficult season of your life.

Yo Really? That is awesome! Yup indeed. :) If it is now to personal or awkward, did your skull fix itself completely? I have a forehead plate that is kind of just free floating. So, they did the surgery early, when I was about two years old, so the skull was still growing. Since it fused too soon, which is the definition of the condition, they had to cut it apart. The issue was, I honestly think that I would not have needed my shunt of they had caught this earlier. Due to the increased pressure they believe that caused my hydrocephalus, because the waterways were damaged and my ventricles were basically perpetually inflamed. To answer, with exception of a small pen sized hole on the top of my skull, everything did heal together. I was only a couple of months old, but my skull never fused. I have two one inch holes in my forehead, and a free floating forehead plate. They did not find my hydrocephalus until I was two, but like you it had some time to cause some damage (I am legally blind in my right eye). When you say legally blind, do you have no vision in the eye, or limited vision? Or decreased depth perception? I really am lucky that I did not sustain any super serious damage Decreased depth perception and blurred vision. When I tested my eyes for the DMV, I could only see the light through their machine, not any of the letters. \n\nI would say you are pretty lucky. But now you have to make sure your shunt always works so you do not go through that again. That would suck...", "Which clock is wrong? ", "What a relief I have had hydrocephalus since birth and had a shunt implanted shortly after birth.  Over the years I have gotten extensions as I grew.  My last surgery was when I was 15.  I am now 29 and for the past year and a half or so I commonly woke up to migraines that Tylenol did not seem to help with at all.  However most of the time by the evening they would subside and I could at least have a pain free evening.  I did not bother going to the doctor since every time I went to the doctor in the past it turned up nothing and I end up feeling like a hypochondriac and wasting a couple hundred dollars on a doc visit I did not need.  But back on the 7th I had the mother of all migraines.  It felt like my eyes were going to explode out of my head so I went to the nurse and she set up an appointment with the doctor to get some xrays done and turns out a simple trip to the doctor to get some prescriptions for migraines ended up in me getting sent to surgery to get my shunt fixed.  The surgeons removed most of my 29 year old shunt and replaced it with a whole new one from my understanding.  They could not get the old one completely out because it was fused with tissue in my chest or something so now I have 1 and a half shunts.  the surgery was on the 7th and I am recovering nicely.  Still feels a little painful to walk around with 3 incisions (1 on my stomach, 1 on my neck and one on the side of my head).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to say it is a relief finally biting the bullet and figuring out what was wrong with me.  The whole ordeal took me by surprise thinking I would just go get a prescription and be done with it only to get rushed into surgery and having to take a few weeks to recover.  I am glad the shunt was the problem because there is an obvious solution to that problem. Otherwise I would still be in the dark as to what has been causing these migraines for over a year. That is awesome! Something similar happened to me over 3 years ago. The recovery is always fun but it is awesome to hear you are all good!

What features/other community are you looking for that this subreddit does not provide? I am not speaking on reddit. I am speaking on an app for hydrocephalus. Just a general question. ", "Has anyone had an ETV that brought them relief after having many shunt revisions? Also , is it generally a low risk / safe procedure? The chances of artery bleeds / injury to the fornix / memory really worries me. Having an ETV in a couple months, had shunts my whole life, I am 26. Success score is 80-90%. I used to be worried about shunt revisions, till I met people who have had 40+ revisions, I realized they were pretty safe and routine, but the upcoming ETV is scaring the hell out of me because I do not know what to expect... is recovery similar? Is it generally safe? I had an ETV and while mine was not successful, I found it a lot easier to go through than shunt surgery. I feel like shunt surgery is a hell of a lot more invasive than having an ETV and therefore is waaaayyyyy more painful. \n\nI was discharged 2 days after surgery (would have been the next day but I got a temperature) and I started feeling like myself again about 5 days after having my ETV. In terms of the risks, I completely understand where you are coming from. Unfortunately it is just one of those things that come along with treatment for our condition. From conversations with my Neurosurgeon and from what I have read, they are generally safe. I also like the idea of there not being a foreign object in your body if they are successful. Hopefully yours is successful! Wishing you the best of luck. I appreciate the reply, thank you very much! ETV is much better Than shunt surgery ... I had 2 ETVs and 2 shunt...\u2639\ufe0f I understand your apprehension. I was pretty freaked out going into my first etv. \n\nI would say it is more invasive in that they are going into your brain more than the shunt surgery, but it is much more likely that it will be a one and done, versus the shunt surgeries. \n\nThe only negative I have found is it took me a couple months to adjust to the new intracranial pressure, compared with my shunt where I did not have any adjustment time. Maybe that is because the last shunt surgery I had was when I was younger and my etv was placed when I was 23. \n\nBut you will be fine. The docs know what they are doing. The incision is tiny and does not hurt as badly. You will be okay. I did at 24.  I have got no memory issues, nothing really weird, I feel fairly healthy.  Sure, there are risks but if it was not inherently safe, they would not be doing it.  It definitely is not routine like a shunt, but for those with whom shunts do not work, I would hazard to say it is a lot better.  Recovery for me was fine, a few weird endocrine things did happen (salt imbalance maybe???) and I was dizzy for a bit but beyond that it felt fine and I no longer have to worry about a shunt that could be damaged if I fall, or the blockages I had (7 in total).  1.5 years later I still feel fine, hoping that it works in the long term as well though of course you will never know until you have had it.  My doctors said the procedure was great and very good for my case, the reason they had not one it prior was just due to lack of a trained surgeon on my first few surgeries, and then lack of resources and time later on.  Feel free to PM me if you want more details. So my little had her etv at 3 days old, recovery was not bad, she ended up with a shunt but that is because success rate for a 3 day old was like 30% Did the etv heal over? I had my etv in july since then i had the tumor that caused the obstructive hydrocephalus removed but im curious like just in case it comes back and the aquaduct is blocked it might be nice to have a backup lol.", "Please help So I have posted quite a bit on here before about my surgeries throughout my low pressure and medium pressure hydrocephalus, but I have started having a new weird symptom about a month after my surgery in June and I just wanted to know if anybody has had a feeling in the back of their neck at the base of their skull that feels and sounds like pop rocks? I have had it since July and my mother- who does not have hydrocephalus- has it too, although she is had symptoms close to my malfunctions including headaches and dizziness. My hydrocephalus was caused by an accident when I was young so I did not get it genetically from her, but we are wondering if maybe she could actually have hydrocephalus? Does anybody else have experience with this? Does it hurt when you hear those sounds? \n\nIf no, then i have same and attribute these sounds to bones / cartilage.  I have been in a few car accidents as a passenger, my neck and back are trashed, but regular exercise and stretching has allowed me to avoid pain. I have the same exact issue, although I only really noticed it after my last revisions in 2012.  It is constant when I turn my head from side to side, but it does not hurt at all.  I have not had any head/neck injuries in addition to my hydro, so I just figure it is cartilege. Ours does not hurt, no. We have also never been involved in any kind of accidents. I am so sorry you have been involved in a few though. I was told that a weird bubbling noise that I occasionally hear could actually be CSF draining/filling/moving. My mother does not have a shunt so I cannot really say it is because of hydro, but ours both comes randomly, it is not every day either. That is strange as I have only been hearing/feeling it for not even 3 months yet- I had my revision in June and I have been hearing/feeling this since July- and my mother is a non shunted person who does not have hydro. Is it normal for shunted and non shunted people? Or should she try to get it checked out? I would like to preface this with saying that I am not a doctor, nor am I qualified in any way to make medical suggestions. I did not have it all my life either, and it is not always constant or really consistent. The lady I knew who had it, she did not have hydrocephalus, but a series of surgeries after being hit by a car and then later getting into an accident with a semi.", "Never had a shunt, just fenestration and diamox Title. Has anyone here avoided getting a shunt and is just taking diamox?\n\nAlso, anybody get the fenestration surgery done?\n\nWhen I had mine, they did a craniotomy and cut out the part of the cyst that was causing CSF buildup.\n\nIt was a major, major recovery and was very painful, but in 6 months I was back to competitive swimming.\n\nThe symptoms were pretty much gone for 2 years!!! Amazing!!!\n\nBut then I started to get some headaches, dizziness and problems again - doctor put me on diamox, said if it helped, I was a \"shunt candidate.\"\n\nWell, it did help. I liked not being dizzy. I did not want the shunt. I asked if I could just stay on this pill, and he said basically, \"Well, yeah, if you want to.\"\n\nSo here I am. No shunt, no dizziness, just peeing a TON, sometimes a little tingly, and no longer able to drink a drop of alcohol (I have tried and it can cause some pretty severe symptoms) I had my fenestration done in 94. I was comatose for 3 days after the surgery and spent almost a month and a half in the hospital. Definitely not a good time! \nI am assuming they did your fenestration due to headaches. How were they post surgery? How are they now? they did my fenestration because of the symptoms but mainly because of the size of the cyst - it was getting large enough that any larger and I could have died - it was blocking the flow of CSF from brain to spine.\n\nThe headaches are a lot better, but I cannot tell at this point if it is due to the surgery or the 2 diamox per day I have been taking for the past year (? maybe two years) or so.\n\nI do get dizzy occasionally. I have pretty much quit drinking too, kind of sad cuz I enjoy parties and going out with friends.\n\nedit: btw I upvoted you, not sure why you were downvoted You should not be on that medication for such a prolonged period of time. I would get a second opinion, it is rather unheard of! A shunt will not end your swimming, there is a lad in America who has a shunt and almost qualified for the Olympics. I am not a doctor and I do not have a shunt (etv) but I am not sure if the shunt surgery would be as devastating as the craniotomy for you. I have taken diamox before and after my etv and could not stand it. But that is just me yeah I am really not sure. The diamox is annoying because I pee a lot and I cannot drink alcohol due to the dehydration and drug mixing (it really makes me dizzy).\n\nWhat were the side effects from diamox that you did not like? I do not know, my neurologist said it is okay and that several patients are on it long term like me. My general doctor said so too.\n\nI really do not know. I keep reading about shunts getting infected, breaking, and people with shunts still having symptoms. If you have the symptoms as before, what is the point? Dehydration. Ringing in ears. Going to the bathroom a lot. Dry mouth. Dry eyes\n\nI am a month and a half out from my etv surgery and still recovering which has been hell. But I think the worst part of recovery was during the two weeks after surgery when I had to take diamox (2 in the morning 2 at night). It was so bad I actually stopped taking it early\n\nAlso it is the worst tasting pill I have ever swallowed\n\nI am in a similar situation to you (I am 26) and I would rather go back to my regular life than have to take that stuff every day and have restrictions Honestly getting a shunt is less awful than diamox. I hate diamox so much. And shunt surgery is cake compared to a craniotomy Ideally you would want to see a neurosurgeon.  Diamox side effects have been well documented. There are a few hydrocephalus groups on fb, and to be honest, I have not come across anyone using diamox long term like you. You could get their opinions. \n\nIf you are not getting headaches etc then a neurosurgeon would not shunt you. You would need to be symptomatic. Some people just adapt to the hydro. Shunts have a very high failure rate. Please tell me more bc my drs are telling me ill be on diamox my rest of life bc they want me on medication versus surgery, and I am adrenal insufficent and terrified it will cause a potassium issue which will trigger a addisons crisis and my heart stops when that happens, I feel like my drs are so stupid they are being reckless with my life! I am on day two of diamox and I hate it Im in Colorado if any one knows of a a GOOD neuro or other DR that xan assist me, im desperate I do not know anything about the adrenal gland, \"addison's crisis,\" or your conditions. All I know is I have been taking diamox twice a day for over a year now and I seem perfectly fine (actually, much much improved) except for a little dehydration.\n\nOther commenters are saying it is bad to be on diamox, but they have cited no evidence.\n\nI would say talk to your doctor, and if you are concerned, ask more doctors. The more opinions you get from more professionals, the better of a decision you can make. I saw a neurosurgeon when he cut open my head for the fenestration. I have since had 2 follow ups with him and both times he said I seemed to be doing great and that I do not need a shunt.\n\nMy neurologist is the one who suggested diamox because I was complaining about some headaches and dizziness - it worked. I asked him if I *had to* get a shunt, and he said no, it is not required given my specific circumstances.\n\nI do have doctors and they are on board with this treatment plan. &gt;shunt surgery is cake compared to a craniotomy\n\nyeah I can imagine. The craniotomy was the scariest thing in my life. I still get kind of scared/creeped out when I think about it. \n\nBut why do you hate diamox so much? I feel like it is not that big of a deal. Okay if you dobt know what adrenal crisis is, than u dobt understand its a chemistry issue on how this works in the cell, for ME that part is critical, so I dobt find this helpful bc u disregarded the factors that ARE why I am concerned I understand. I have been on it over a year and just gotten used to it!\n\nI would like to hear more about how the shunt goes and all that  afterwards - can you find me on here and give us an update after?\n\nHope you find relief! I only gave you good advice :)\n\ntalk to your doctor, and if you are still concerned, talk to more doctors and get more opinions. does not a shunt require a lot more visits to the doctor for adjusting and stuff? \n\nwhat about the risk of infection, breakage, blockage, and more?\n\nI have read that shunts need to be replaced after some years too, so is not that like signing up for many future surgeries? Ok you have nothing to offer diacussing diamox you just said talk to ny drs, when I wanted to talk to other diamox dependant other who know how it effects blood chemistry,  ie, why I was specific on the AI, so please stop, you are not being helpful or  even diacussing diamox What is wrong with you to keep mucking with some one who is telling you to stop?\n\nNo your \"advice\" is not good, that is a completely projected self evaluation, advice is helpfulwhen you actually offfer data, or something the person HASNT thought of!!\n\n, you only threw  the most BS answer possible, so pleae again STOP, if you cannot discuss diamox and have ANY knowledge of what that does with an AI pt , you do not even understand the nature of the physical AI crisis, please just STOP-\n\nIf you even googled it you would see this\n\u2010---------------\nShowing results for\u00a0adrenal\u00a0insufficiency\u00a0and diamox\nSearch instead for\u00a0adrenal insufficency and diamox\n\nSearch Results\n\nFeatured snippet from the web\n\n\ufffc\n\ninhibitors (Includes\u00a0Diamox)\u00a0adrenal insufficiency.

They did not implant anything inside me\n\n\nI know etvs are only available for some hydro patients but I was told it will lead to less complications and surgeries and hopefully that is true this is my post. You commented first. I was just trying to be nice. Forgive me for ever trying to be nice to you! I will not make that mistake again. Lmao\n\nI literally said \"ask your doctor.\" Not me. You might just be...really dumb. oh so is it kind of like fenestration? It is a new hole in the ventricle? I do not know what a fenestration is but here is a link \n\n\n\nYeah they made a whole for the spinal fluid to drain out of so i do not need a shunt have you ever had issues or symptoms since then? That is an awesome idea and procedure!\n\nlike, did you need diamox after etv, ever?\n\ndo you ever feel a little dizzy? I needed to take it two weeks after the surgery \n\nI had it 51 days ago, I am not fully recovered yet but yes I did feel dizzy and had to deal with a bunch of other side effects but I will make a full recovery I hated taking it. After every pill I would get extremely nauseous and often throw up. Plus ringing in my ears, tingly limbs, muscle cramping, and dizziness. But hopefully that does not happen to you. When my doctor weaned me off all those symptoms disappeared and now I would like to never take it again. As far as your shunt questions, I was nervous to get the shunt, but ready to move on, but thankfully I have not had to do much since I got it in 2018. I only have to get it adjusted after an mri and my doctor recently put me on visits only every two years. The risk of infection is highest in the first year but it is generally accepted that if you make it past that your risks are very decreased. I know people that got shunts in the 80s and never had a subsequent surgery. &gt;But hopefully that does not happen to you.\n\nI had tingling for the first 2 weeks, but it is going to be 2 years soon, and I have had none of the other side effects. Diamox is just part of my daily routine. My mouth is often dry and I pee a lot, but that is about it.\n\n&gt;I know people that got shunts in the 80s and never had a subsequent surgery.\n\nwell that is pretty awesome too then!", "BJJ and shunt ", "Seeking advice Migraine vs Shunt Complication Headache - Google is useless! Hello\n\nI am after some advice about how to tell whether my headache is coming from my chronic daily migraine or whether it is a shunted headache?\n\nContext - I have had chronic daily migraines since November they started after my shunt was revised my shunt has since been checked twice with no complications found however in the post couple of weeks the headache side of the Migraine and the dizziness seems to have gotten more severe and now I am panicking that the migraine is masking a shunt complication. I have also had a couple of instances of sharp shooting pain best to the shunt\n\nIf anyone has any advice or has been through Migraines with a shunt and knows how to tell the headache &amp; symptoms appear I would be most grateful of your advice \ud83d\ude42\n\nT.I.A Is yours adjustable shunt? \n\nMy partner found that after surgery there is some relief cause opening up for a revision relieves the pressure for a while til the shunt starts over or under draining again.\n\nAsk for a CT scan and shunt series x-ray and see if the ventricles are smaller than usual, which means it is over draining. \n\nThe symptoms sound the same as hers prior to her last few surgeries and similar I found complications.\n\nThen we got the adjustable and she is had it adjusted once without surgery which gave awesome results after a nap. Thank you for your advice I had a stint in hospital with a week of ICP monitoring and adjusting the shunt to rule the sunny out in early February and I do not want to keep going back in case it is nothing which it keeps seeming to not be when I take myself to hospital \ud83d\ude14 My partner had to do that at time and keep going back.\n\nHer neurosurgeon knew if she said there was an issue, there was. You guys know best.\n\nAll the other docs just gave pain relief til it was enough to go home.\nThat is does t fix the problem though and it comes back.\n\nIf you have a manual shunt, ask for scans next time you go in and consider changing the flow a little. \n\nGoodluck! Med student/hydro researcher here, we do not have any good literature on this issue, so for now we depend on patients. In the future we hope to be able to monitor Csf flow non invasively from home. You could ask your neurosurgeon/neurologist about trialing a headache medicine (like sumatriptan) but the worry would be that by blocking the headache you block the only sign of shunt failure, definitely something to consult the pros about. Thank you I have actually just had the surgery to insert the valve to check ICP levels without having to insert a probe everytime \ud83d\ude42 so I now know my shunt is working as they checked it over while inserting the Telemetric ICP monitor.

And super weird question but have you lost weight recently? \n\nThe tube length on your VP shunt is measured to be proportionate with your height and weight. And if you are a woman who might want to have kids they make it a bit longer too. \n\nI was a bit bigger when I had the surgery, then I lost 2 stone and suddenly the tube was stabbing me all the time! It is the worst. Mine gets caught on my womb (tmi I know) but that causes it to feel sore and inflamed. \n\nJust thought I would mention as it could be as simple as an annoying catheter poking where it should not. When mine gets caught down there I do some cardio as it makes it move somewhere else. \n\nNot sure if that is helpful, but I hope it is! I do have a VP shunt and I actually have lost weight recently! My shunt was placed when I was severely underweight (due to shunt malfunction that kept me asleep 22 hours a day and completely unaware of my own existence/ also on an ng tube). But I got my weight back to normal and then years later gained a significant amount of weight. I have lost more weight this past 6 months than I have in a very long time, and especially in the past month or so. This actually does help to explain things! I wonder what could help the catheter shift to a more comfortable position? Usually I can try to ignore my shunt inside me but this pain is such an unwelcome feeling (not to mention reminder of its presence). Ps I will try cardio when my cold is gone :) Hey! So, where are you? States? UK? In the UK we have a muscle relaxant called buscopan. It stops your stomach from moving around so much when you eat (or have a cold and are (grossly) collecting snot in there) and it will stop the tube from being quite so active. No muscle movement, no shunt movement. I was told to take it when my tube kept getting stuck on my womb\u2026 no words can describe that pain! \n\nAlso, just going for a light walk and stretching your upper body out while doing so can help dislodge it from wherever it might be stuck. \n\nSometimes though it is a little bugger and will refuse to move\u2026 just life with a shunt I guess.

Hello im John im 16 and when i was 10 i had a hydrocephalus episode meaning it gradually developed overtime. I had surgery at 10 and got a valve-shunt placed on the right area of my head. Now, after 6 full years without encountering any issue at all i got the pfeizer vaccine (1st dose) which came with really unbearable migraines, went to check it and apparently the valve was broken and wasnt sucking as much fluid as it was supposed to. When a valve breaks however it can still function it just absorbs less fluid. Anyways for some reason i developed a whole lot of fluid on the left area of my head, causing me to undergo 2 operations (on for fixing the valve and one for inserting another one). Does this problem sound familiar or was the vaccine a coincidence (sry for my english) If anyone has any similar story or knows anything about this please let me know, id be pleased to learn more about this! Would there be any way for them to know when the valve broke? (Before or after you got your vaccine?). That sounds tough, I hope you are better now.\n\nMy dad (65 years old with non programmable VP shunt) got the Pfizer vaccine. He was just tired with sore arm, no headaches or anything. Thanks for the response.\n\nThere would be no way to know unfortunately and that is why it remains a mystery. They dont know if they can associate the pfeizer with increased fluid on my head or the valve being ruined or just a coincidence. Tons of respect to your dad as well, glad he has everything under control. I am no way a medical professional, but it sounds like it was just a coincidence. I have had a shunt since I was 3 months old and I have had 30 revisions in 30 years. I work as a scrub tech at a major hospital and as soon as the vaccine was offered to the employees, I took the Pfizer one. The only symptom I experienced was the lymph node in my armpit on the side of the injection swelled up and was hot for a day or two with no other symptoms. I would say it is 99% likely to be a coincidence. There is a good chance that the intramuscular injection does not make its way into your brain, and even if it did, there is no real reason to assume it would cause a mechanical device to fail. Shunt Catheters (the tubing) do fail, especially when you are younger and still developing / growing. thi\u2026thirty revisions \ud83d\ude2d?? youre right. what i was thinking though was that they told me my second \u201cnatural valve\u201d (the one i was born with and hadnt changed till now) has stopped working as well and fluid built up. maybe it didnt cause the valve to stop working and it has a for a long time and the vaccine like affected the amount of fluid concentration in my brain? i dont know, just looking for people with similar stories Do not think that because I have had 30 revisions in 30 years that it is a lot or a little. Some people have gone days to weeks between revisions and some people are  in their 50s or 60s and still have their original shunt that was put in at birth. It all varies person to person. that is fair. anyways thanks for sharing your thoughts on this It is hard to know without knowing what caused your hydrocephalus. In a simplistic summation: Spinal fluid moves down essentially a one way path from deep inside the brain and is absorbed by the body at the end of the line outside of the brain. There are a few places in the middle that can cause the flow to back up. The how, when and where is different for a lot of people, especially those who were not born with it or who quickly developed it after birth. Do not overthink this one. You got this, and I am happy to text with you while you do it. If it helps! Checking in to vote on coincidence. Same valve since I was born (1984), had both Pfeizer doses and nothing but a sore arm for a day. Dont worry buddy mine failed only once in 27 years Hello John,\n\nAt 16, I think you have so many awesome surprises in life waiting for you. Vaccinate. Coincidence. I did get a headache, but it was not worse than usual. My arm on the other hand, felt like Mike Tyson punched it for a day. I got the J&amp;J and had a fever of 103 for a day but was sick with migraines for 3 days.  Not sure if any of it has to do with hydro but that is my experience. I do not see how a vaccine could cause a valve to break, so my guess is that it was a coincidence. I got my 1st dose of the vaccine yesterday and have had no symptoms other than a sore arm and my shunt feels fine. My daughter is your age and has a programmable VP shunt. No problems with her shunt after injections. Tho she did have a bit of a headache after the second shot. I am glad you got it all taken care of! Sounds like my last three valves; they were not suctioning enough fluid i dont think it broke the valve i just learned that my left natural valve has stopped working and fluid built up on the non valve area. (natural area) that is why im saying like perhaps it increased the fluid in my brain i dont know thank u man i apreaciate it a lot!!  Everything good now mate? Sad to hear that! I had migraines as well for 3 days, until i seeked help and got diagnosed again. Everything alright now? Hahahaha glad youre okay buddy, i think that is normal. Stay safe  I didnt even think twice about the vaccination i just got my second dose today. i was just looking for answers as to what caused my second complication. i thought it would be good if everyone with the same coincidence as me (if there is) would express their thoughts so more medical data is gathered. Appreciate the concern man, love from Greece Thanks for the insight. Im pleased and both saddened by the fact that im not the only one. Guess my case was a complete coincidence, since the migraines wouldnt go away. Appreciate the insight, have a nice day!!  I hope I will be ok now I hope that as well man, i really do.. hydrocephalus sucks Glad to hear that, hopefully that will be the case for me as well. It sucks because im an athelete and i have been required to stay out for more than 4 months in total due to the surgeries. Well, that is life i guess. Hope the best for you!

These past few days the weather has been going back and forth and it is definitely throwing me off.\n\nAny tips on how to keep this from affecting your day to day life? 100% yes. Got a revision in May of \u201816 and the only day to day symptoms I have at the point are weather related. I can tell when it is going to rain, and I also feel bad on days where the weather jumps from hot to cold and vice versa within the same day. \n\nThe only real consolation I have is just knowing that my symptoms are simply weather related and I have way less anxiety in regards to shunt failure/malfunction.

Is it safe to lie down flat? Will it cause pressure in the head? \n\nAlso, about the confusion, did it go away after some time? I know with surgery it takes time especially with the anesthesics and all, but were you able to get your memory back? I noticed my dad sometimes forgets he is at a hospital when he calls home, but then other times he is aware of his surroundings. I also understand it is different for everyone..\n\nJust wondering what to expect for my dad when he comes home from the hospital. I want to make him feel as comfortable as possible. \n\nThanks everyone. This has been a very helpful community and I have been learning a lot about hydrocephalus. Much appreciated to everyone here. The first few months after my shunt were a bit hard to get used to in terms of sleep, I found it was weird sleeping in it but it got so ordinary after those few months that I could not imagine life without it... until I had my ETV, now I am back to normal lol. And it will not cause pressure to my knowledge, otherwise it would be pretty hazardous. \n\nI fully recovered from each surgery within a few weeks. I never had any major confusion issues though I know it is problematic for some, especially in older adults. Some older adults find it is somewhat prolonged, though it would be inappropriate of me to make any commentary there. 18 years after my last revision and the presence of the shunt reservoir still drives me nuts (perhaps because it is the only one put in while I have a concept of life without it).  For me, it is placed in such a spot that, whether I lay on my back or my right side, the weight of my skull pushes down directly onto the shunt, so I am forced to sleep on my left side(any pillow sturdy enough to lift my head off the surface to relieve the weight would be large enough that  the shunt would make contact with it).  My two older ones were put in infancy. I do not recall having any major difficulties other than getting a momentary headache upon lying down or getting back up, but everyone is different. Knowing it is there does take some getting used to, though. Yes, I figured confusion would be a problem for older adults. But I am glad to hear life is back to normal for you. I guess it will just take my dad some time to get use to. Thanks for your reply. :) That sounds so uncomfortable to sleep with :( the placement of the shunt would be problematic depending on how you sleep eh, but I guess it just takes time to adjust to that. I hope you have been getting better sleep lately. Thanks for you reply! Yes, my dad will for sure say he has headaches. I just hope they are not really bad headaches for him. Definitely will take a lot of time to get use to. Thanks for replying :)", "Jiu jitsu.. Friends, \n\nI have been stable for over 25 years.  No revisions or issues since my last mri. \n\nI want to start training in jiu jitsu but am concerned about the twisting and pressure on my shunt during lessons.. what are your thoughts.  \n\nSince my last surgery, i have had several blows the head, and many examples of rough play with no issue or symptoms. This is probably something to ask a GP, but I went through a good amount of time with a VP shunt playing sports and had no issues.  The main problems I had with it were blockages, and from your history you do not seem to have had that same problem.  I think you have to get particularly rough with a VP shunt to cause any damage. Thanks. This info helps while I try to book with my neurosurgeon.  \n\nMy shunt was put in at age 10, then I had several revisions due to complications,  after that point I had to stop all contact sports and activities..could not even go to paintball or attend gym class without a helmet.   The only activity I could excel at in elementary/high school was weight lifting and racket sports.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I want to try Jiu-Jitsu and know that I cannot tell the club about my prior conditions or else they will likely not allow me in the gym..if they are like other facilities.   I would never be the suing type of guy anyway, if I go down with issues due to my shunt then it is 100% on me.", "Has anyone on here with hydrocephalus found any success with migraine therapy? I know that of course if there is an underlying issue, the shunt must be replaced. In my case, I only have headache, no other symptoms, and it is not horrible, maybe a constant 6/10. my ventricles are small, and my neurosurgeon told me that some with slit like ventricles find relief with migraine meds. Of course if they do not work over the next couple months, I am going to have my valve replaced, but has anyone on here taken any sort of neurologist prescribed meds to treat headaches that are possibly caused by hydro? Thanks. Well, I have not read much info about that. If you have slit like vents, it is best not to get them slit. You need to anti siphoning device. What kind of meds could they prescribe?  I am curious. Not quite sure about all of them but the first they suggested is called Emgality Looks heavy duty. You must be in a lot of pain.  \n\nI am surprised the nuro is not taking a closer look.  Have you tried cannabis?", "Just curious if anyone has had this issue Hey, so I fell in the shower a couple weeks ago and landed pretty hard on my chest. Now if I feel my shunt tubing on my neck I will feel the occasionally bump. It ends up going away and has not gotten any bigger or moved spots so for all I know it could be just scar tissue moving. I am not showing any symptoms or anything so I am a little less worried than I used to be but I just was curious if anyone has had these issues before. I live in a very small town where the doctors do not understand anything about shunts or Hydrocephalus and the nearest specialist is at least 6 hours away so I thought I would try and reach out to this community first.. I have had a shunt since I was a year old but sometimes they still freak me out. Is there someone you could email, call or FaceTime ? Imo it is prob nothing if you are feeling ok but just Incase it is something they would want to look at ? Idk I personally would not worry I have nothing useful other than my two year old has a shunt and as you probably did at that age, she spends a solid amount of time falling down and face planting. I like the idea of FaceTiming or Skyping a neurologist or someone qualified even if only to keep up to date with them and know who you would want to contact in case an issue did arise. I wish there was someone. My neurologist who had been with me since the beginning recently retired and no one at the hospital will reccommend anyone else. Hello friend, I am from Maple Ridge BC, were like neighbours eh!? Where in Alberta are you from? ...go into emergency in Calgary or Edmonton and one those docs will help you out. \n\nFrom what I know about shunts, if you were going to have a problem then it would have presented as a headache, or pressure behind your eye.  Any eye doc, even some opticians,  can look behind your eye and let you know if there is an issue.  \n\nI have had several shut revisions, but this last one has been with me through falls, bumps, and significant hits to the front and back of my head.  I have always been able to feel my shunt from the top valve to just under my collar bone. \n\nHope this helps. I live 6 hours away from Edmonton and 14 hours away from Calgary. Visiting those ers is not something I can just get in the car and do. I live in Grimshaw. Thank you though Got it.   Peace River or GP will definitely have doctors who can help you out.   It is not difficult to diagnose issues related to shut malfunction. Believe it or not I have talked to these doctors about this in the past(I have had a shunt since I was a year old). I had a malfunction a few years back and they almost killed me because they woukdn't send me to Edmonton right away because they had no idea what it was. I am pretty sure I am okay. It is been a month and still no headaches. I do have a little bump that comes and goes once in a while in the neck but it does not seem to cause me any issues. My chest is still sore but other than that I do not seem to norice anything. My mom and my husband who have both been through malfunctiosns with me say I am fine, especially after all this time so I guess maybe they are right.  Thank you so much for reaching out though. I greatly appreciate it You are welcome.  \n\nWe will stay positive and ensure someone is checking up on you each morning, if there is a malfunction during the night then you may not wake up, but you would likely have experienced this already if there was an issue.  \n\nStill, during your next visit to town go see a doctor and get it checked. \n\nTake care.", "2016 Hydrocephalus Association Conference will be in Minneapolis, MN ", "Pain around shunt? This morning woke up, sat up, and instantly felt like I would been smashed on the head with a mallet.\n\nMy shunt hurts? But also it is inside my head? Like when I turn my head I get dizzy and there is a stabbing pain from my shunt site to my forehead. Also my shunt site aches. If I sit still I am fine.\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? Similar experiences?\n\nAll appreciated. I would take pain meds and see if that helps. If you start vomiting go to the ER. If it does not go away in an hour or gets worse I would give your neurologist a call and see what they say, if you cannot get a hold of them go to the ER. Better safe than sorry Yeah. They always tell me that when I am there too.\n\nI am feeling a bit better now, but only insomuch as that I do not get dizzy/pain unless I turn too quickly. I have had my shunt since birth and have had zero revisions so honestly I am not the best person to give advice. I just know the brain is very very sensitive and you will vomit if the levels are wrong so that is a good rule of thumb My most recent revision was preceded by bouts of sudden, intense pain anytime I stood up. It would recede after 5-30 seconds or so but it was miserable. Sometimes had pain around my shunt, but not usually.\n\nPain meds did help, but only temporarily. The pain always returned.\n\nIf it continues more than a day or two, I would go ahead and call your neurologist and/or get access to testing as quickly as you are able (we usually just go to the ER, but I know that varies by insurance/region/etc.) I know I am not op, but this is happening to me and I am being told I need a revision, that it could be a malfunction of the anti-siphon device. It will be my first revision\u2026 I had no idea symptoms like this were a red flag and did not mention it to my new neurosurgeon. If it is not too intrusive could you tell me if it was due to a shunt malfunction on your part or an infection? I am wary of my situation and still not convinced it is not an infection of some kind OP how have you been since posting? I hope you are ok. I am going through this same thing and have been for months. I am told my anti-siphoning device could be malfunctioning and may need a revision. I have not mentioned these symptoms to my neurosurgeon, even tho they are concerning, bc there was not enough time. I reported to the doctor. Apparently we had a super high barometric pressure that transitioned quite suddenly to a massive low pressure system.\n\nThey said it is not uncommon to experience ice pick headaches from that, and not uncommon for them to centre around the shunt site.\n\nSo I will live. At the moment I only have a grumbly migraine. So that is progress? Or at least normal for the weather. Not too personal! Glad to share.\n\nI had to have a shunt revision to correct the problem; it was not an infection (that I am aware of, anyway). I actually took antibiotics prior to the revision because I have a separate lung disease and we thought that might help, but it ended up having no impact on the symptoms \tI was having.\n\nI do not know the specifics of what the blockage/break in the shunt was, but I ended up having to having to be cut open at/near my shunt site in my head, but not in my stomach. He essentially just disconnected the tubing from my former shunt site and put in a new probe* close by and reconnected it.\n\n* I think there is a better word for this, but I am still waking up.

You could ask to have ICP monitoring done. This would show if there are large changes in your pressure across the day. Particularly first thing in the morning after lying down all night ect.

Not to mention the stomach pain that comes with anxiety - thought it was shunt related \n\n\nI am thinking of seeing a GP about it as it is just horrible- do antidepressants / SSRI/ SNRI have negative effects on hydrocephalus? I do not think there is any interactions directly. But I do know some SSRIs do not mix well with some painkillers like Ibuprofin and Excedrin. \n\nCompletely person to person though. Sounds like me honestly", "How am I doing? Hey guys, I found out I had hydrocephalus three weeks ago after an eye doctor found swollen optic nerves in both eyes and he had me go to an emergency room. I was experiencing some vision problems and the occasional headache, that is it. Fast forward to now and I am 7 days removed from an etv surgery. I have been pretty weak and feel dizzy but experience no pain or headaches. The dizziness happens when standing or sitting up for long periods of time so I spent most of the week in bed. Also, while the vision problems are reduced, I still see them. I have a post op appointment next week but I was curious how my recovery has been to you guys. Any idea when the dizziness can go away? I am 26 and fit, doctors say I can do non contact sports in two weeks. Is that really something you think I will be able to do? Thanks guys I have an etv and experienced that immediately after surgery and after my most recent shunt blockage/ pressure imbalance. I also have vision issues sometimes immediately after standing as well. \n\nAre you taking any type of blood thinner? After I started taking a baby aspirin regularly, my symptoms seemed to dissipate. \n\nWhat are you vision symptoms like? Are they constant or do you have onset symptoms like the dizziness? Do your vision symptoms worsen when you are dizzy? You have a shunt and an etv? Did the etv fail? Did you have issues walking after the etv? I know I am only on day 7 so this will likely resolve but its frustrating\n\nI am not on blood thinners, and the vision problems normally happen after I change position but also just when rolling over when laying down. Usually seeing spots/colors for a bit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat was your recovery like? It helps me relax knowing the road ahead I have even if its a long one Hi \nI also had an ETV and before surgery I was extremely sick. I did have a big. I regained my eye sight after surgery but suffered from dizziness for a a few months after and and even after two years get it from time to time. It is normal with hydro and having an ETV means the flow can be slow at times depending on conditions.\nYou still need to heal from your surgery, so do not expect to feel better for a while yet, hopefully you will slowly have more good than bad days, take it easy and get loads\nOf sleep Thanks for sharing\n\nDo you know how long until you felt like \u201cyourself\u201d (out of bed rest and walking around like normal)\n\nAre you able to drive after surgery? I have both a VA shunt and an etv. I have a hard time regulating my intracranial pressure because of it. \n\nMy etv has never failed - I have only had failures with my shunts. Most recently, I got a blood clot on the distal end of my shunt catheter and caused a big hooplah, but my etv saved me quite a bit of misery. \n\nNo real issues walking that immediately come to mind, that said, I was in a pretty bad way when I had my etv surgery and was in the icu for a few days after surgery. So I took it pretty easy after but I was up and moving in a week with no issue\n\nMy recovery was interesting in that, I was very very dumb and went immediately back to school and did not give myself time to heal properly. I left school on a Friday, was checked into the hospital on Saturday, surgery on Sunday, icu for two days, and was back in class the following Monday. I was not kind to myself and I sincerely regret it. I definitely prolonged my healing process because of my stubbornness. \n\nIn terms of things you can expect for the healing process, I would say expect to be uncomfortable for a month or so while your body heals and readjusts to this new thing. It is got to find a new pressure that it wants to operate with. It might take some time, but your body will adjust to this new pressure and you will feel great. \n\nAlso - do not forget - while the procedure is routine and easy for the surgeons, you just had pretty intensive brain surgery. You body has never had to regrow brain tissue like it is actively doing right now. It is going to take a while for you to heal from the physical trauma of what that procedure did to your brain. \n\nSo be patient with yourself. If it feels good to lay down because you are  experiencing some dizziness, lay down. If I had to do it all again, I would rest and sleep as much as possible and be patient with you healing body. Trust it will heal and get back to normal. \n\nI also experience vision symptoms - I tell myself the vision loss and the weird spots and colors thing as well is just attributed to the intracranial pressure pushing on different parts of the brain weird. \n\nJust some other things, you might experience some discomfort when it rains, or when you travel to high or low altitudes - (not so much on a planes though which is nice.) Whenever there is a change in atmospheric pressure, there might be some sort of intracranial pressure readjustment and slight discomfort associated with it. I do not say that to scare you, but just so you know that it is no biggie if it happens.\n\nGood luck, hydrocephalus friend. Hang in there\n\nHappy to answer any other experiential questions you have as well Thanks for the heads up with the elevation changes. I have family in Denver so visiting might get interesting I feel like it took two to three weeks before I started feeling more energy. And was able to slowly get back to normal. I honestly cannot remember when I drove \nBut my nausea was playing up for a long time and driving was not much fun for me. My case was a little tricky because a second rare neuro co diction was found on the first MRI when they found hydro, they also discovered I had a dural AF fistula of the spine the may have affected blood flow to my brain. I have had it fixed since though. \n\nAlso my hydro surgery a nurse told me to remember my brain had just had just been opened and had surgical instruments inside it and that part alone needs to heal ( where they went in) and I cannot expect to feel normal for a while. Also hydro can never be cured so from time to time I will feel dizzy or tired and need to take it easy when it happens. Heh. I had my surgery in August 2017, and at my follow-up visit I proudly told the neurologist I was up to a mile and a half on the treadmill. He looked at me a bit oddly and suggested that I slow it down a bit.\n\nI look back and laugh, because prior to the surgery I was doing 5K's and running 2-3 times a week, and at that follow-up I was crying. I was probably their star patient because everything was going so well and there I was sobbing \"I want my life back\".\n\nAnd I did. Just took a while. Hi I had an ETV as well and did have some blurred eye site for a few months after, but it did come right. I was told the optic nerve can take time to heal after damage and pressure. \nI would say they will che k your eyes often as they do mine and they will see it getting better or worse\nI go ever 6 mths for a check", "Slipped on grass, headache since I was outside yesterday and i slipped onto my bottom and i have slept since and i have had not a headache really but my head hurts. does it have anything to do with my shunt?

My neurosurgeon says these things do not make any noise, but I can clearly hear it make some buzzing like noises when I feel a little more pressure in my head, or when I move my head to a certain position. The noises pulsate to the rhythm of my blood flow. Noises also occur when I stand up too suddenly and get lightheaded. Was wondering if this has happened to anyone? Yeah, it is not just you. It is been a few years but there would be times when I would be off in space or stop in the middle of a sentence and 'listen to it drain' as I would say. It would be a loud buzzing and then a tingle and it would be gone. I know exactly what you mean Yep. I have had a VP programmable shunt for 12 years now (before that I had a non-programmable). I hear the noise you are describing frequently. Especially at night when I am trying to go to sleep. \n\nNeurosurgeons are great at surgery, but they do not really know anything about patient experience, imho. It also happened to me when I finished the surgery for the first week. Then doctor told me that it might be something wrong with the pressure of the shunt. Then we adjusted it. I did not hear any noise until now. HECK YES!!! I hear/feel it often! I was told by someone i described it to said it sounded like a check ball valve rattling.. 10000%. I had my vp shunt revised 3 weeks ago and it is been buzzing/making draining noises like crazy. While it can be super annoying, it is also kind of comforting for me - let us me know it is working \ud83d\ude02 Not just you, I hear the same when I lay down on the shunt side. Not just thee, i heareth the same at which hour i did lie down on the shunt side\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` I posted a question about this experience before. When I asked my neurosurgeon she seemed completely surprised by this and had no idea what I was talking about. I was told by fellow redditors that it is the sound of the shunt working alittle harder (like when the pressure changes in your head when you stand too quickly). But it does mean it is working (at least from what i have been told). Someone had said they stopped hearing it then later realized their shunt was malfunctioning. Hello! Yep - I had it too! I was told the same thing. It is not just you. It can stop though. Once you are used to it and then it stops\u2026 that is almost worse. Mine buzzed all the time for a year and then just fell silent and it is never buzzed again. All the scans show it is all working so no one knows what happened. The buzzing is the sound of a tiny ball bearing in the valve. When it drains and sometimes just when you move it will tink about in there. It does not necessarily happen when it drains, it just sounds and feels like it does as sometimes it does. It took me a very long time to come to terms with the noise and what it meant\u2026 only for it to disappear again\u2026 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Yeah! Mine stopped being noisy so I spent a good few months in and out of hospital in a panic. Mine is still working though, so it is just a weird thing that happened. I reckon my ball bearing is stuck! Oh oh oh also my husband and I have worked out that if he places his ear right next to my shunt and I push the reservoir he can hear the noise too. This helped me realise I was not mad! \ud83d\ude02 *Is that what that is?*\n\nI feel like I vaguely know what you mean, but it might also just be the really bad pipes in my house. Might have to ask my neurosurgeon about this. yes!! I hear it every time I stand up and notice a pressure change in my head, this was the part that made me freak out the most. I feel more at ease now know it is just not me! Thanks!!", "My lab just published a study on hydro, would love to hear everyone is perspective on it  It is nice to see what most of us know organized and presented scientifically in a formal context. Shunts fail a lot especially with little infants and toddlers. The paper mentions astrocytes and microglia as potential culprits, but I was under the impression that ependymal cells that were the ones most frequently migrating into the ventricular catheters? The cost aspect of hydrocephalus also goes beyond shunt placement and revisions. There are obviously more check ups and precautionary imaging which add up, but overlooked aspect is the cost of false alarms. Neonates, Infants and toddlers obviously do not have the ability to effectively communicate symptoms so parents like myself frequently err on the side of caution and rush to the ER anytime their child vomits, has bad Visual tracking, is lethargic or has a fever. My child has accommodative esotropia and is a frequent vomiter. Even as a pragmatic and rational parent I have found myself at the ER so many times I cannot even recall. The ependymal cells do not seem to migrate in. Occasionally there are episodes of over-drainage or catheter migration where the choroid plexus/ependyma end up getting sucked into the shunt. The study cited in the sentence mentioning the microglia/astrocytes shows that they are likely the main culprits. My lab\u2019s current studies have found evidence of both. My heart goes out to patients and parents with the uncertainty and needing to go to ER. We are aware that it is a huge problem. I am trying to get a study started to see how this could be improved. Additionally, other labs are currently testing devices (that kind of look like band aids) which can sense CSF flow non invasively and can hopefully help with monitoring without needing to run to the ER. I do not think I have the medical background to understand the whole paper but I would like to ask if there is any data regarding people whose bodies have \"fixed\" themselves, thus erasing the need for any shunt? How common is that? How does it happen? It is not very common. I do not have exact numbers, and I can tell you that it varies by the etiology of hydrocephalus. Frankly, we do not know why it happens most of the time. Occasionally for cases of obstructive hydrocephalus, a membrane can rupture allowing the natural flow of CSF. This is a similar principle to how endoscopic third ventriculostomies work. Thanks for explaining. One other thing while we are at it, if you do not mind. How about inheritance?\n\n I have Dandy-Walker (which led to congenital hydro but fortunately I have no issues whatsoever!) and one thing I worry about a lot is if I want to have children. How well do we know if this increases the chances of hydro developing in my kids?  We do not know. Most cases of Dandy-Walker are sporadic (random). However there are cases where it seems to be genetically inherited, this second type seems to be less common. If you are worried and at a point in life where you are planning a family I would suggest genetic testing in order to give you an estimate of the risk of passing it on. I did a genetic test and basically what I have been told is that everything was right chromosome-wise, and that other than that it would be pretty hard to know where DW \"came from\" and/or come out with any sort of probability of passing it on. Could that be really the case?\n\nThanks a lot for your information! Yes, it is entirely possible we would not be able to tell where it \u201ccame from\u201d. The types of tests that can tell chromosome level problems (called karyotypes or FISH) are different from sequencing (and there is different levels of sequencing too). So there may be a genetic basis, although it could also have just been random or something that crossed the placenta when you were a fetus. If it was random, the odds of a child having it are low. Part of the problem is that we do not have an exhaustive list of which mutations could increase the chances of DW, so we might not be able to tell which is which.", "If you have experienced similar, what did you end up doing?

Apparently when my original surgery was done they did not have all the doctor's they needed so when they got to my stomach part my neurosurgeon just put it between my skin and the nerves in that area. And the shunt was draining into its self the entire 2 weeks I have had it. Yesterday (Tuesday) they did another surgery to fix the part in my stomach. It seems to be working I am way more alert and am able to walk. My only thing is that now they reopened my cut they made in surgery 1 but also made 2 extra openings and I do not know why. But now I have 4 scars on my stomach 1 on my chest and 1 or 2 on my head. So now I am at this.

I hope you are doing better :) Yea im gettin there hope all is well for your dad too", "PSA: Always get a second opinion Our two year old daughter has a shunt, and for the past three months she has been vomiting in the night. We called out neurosurgeon right when it started and told them we were pretty sure it was shunt malfunction. They told us there is no way, and that we need to see our pediatrician. For three months, we tried troubleshooting it with our pediatrician and messaging our neurosurgeon with updates and questions. A week ago, we begged and we finally convinced them to give us an appointment. They checked the shunt pressure and said everything was fine. We asked if we could do an MRI, and they said it was not necessary. Then yesterday, after months of no sleep and vomiting, we brought her to the emergency room and the neurosurgeon there spent an hour to take x-rays and MRI, and knew 100 percent that it was shunt malfunction and we were able to get her surgery.\n\nLooking back, I am beating myself up for not going to another neurosurgeon for a second opinion right away. I could have fixed this months ago if I did that. So please, do not do what I did. If you have a strong sense that something is wrong with your shunt and neurosurgery tells you it is not, go see another neurosurgery department for a second opinion. I will never make that mistake again.", "Shunt failure symptoms in babies Hi there! 8 months ago I posted about being pregnant and scared about my unborn daughter's increased ventricles/possible hydrocephalus (unsure how to link to it while on mobile, but will add the link when I am at a computer). She was born via emergency c-section at 36 weeks gestation when her ventricles increased rapidly in a two week span. She was shunted at 4 days old and spent 2 weeks in the NICU.  She is almost 6 months old now and is doing great! She is reaching her milestones within the acceptable times for her adjusted and actual ages. She receives physical therapy through our state's early intervention program as well. Her follow-up MRI a month and a half ago showed that the shunt was working perfectly and there is even more grey matter present now compared to my fetal MRI and the one she had in the days following the surgery. \n\nWe were told the signs of shunt failure, which include vomiting and other potentially normal illness signs. They did not tell us how long these symptoms should exist before considering shunt failure rather than a normal virus-type thing. Does anyone have experience or advice on this? I plan on getting in contact with our pediatrician and/or neurosurgeon about this as well. Cannot really help you but I just wanted to give you some reassurance.\n\nI am 37, shunt at 2 months, never had to replace the system other than expanding the tubing and besides some minor inconveniences with the tubing bothering me I have a perfectly normal life. Hope everything goes well for you! The first 2 years are really tough because babies really cannot communicate. Just a heads up: Pediatricians are all going to recommend going to the ER there is even a slight chance of shunt failure. Symptoms of a shunt failure are unfortunately pretty similar to a cold, which makes it tough. Vomiting and lethargy are the two big ones. You also want to look for inability to sleep and \u201csun setting eyes\u201d. Sun setting eyes is when they cannot look up and will usually avoid eye contact. If you see that it is time to roll to the hospital. When my daughter was less than 2 she had 2 revisions. Each time there was vomiting and vision issues. She was also lethargic and tired, but could not sleep. Revisions are a crummy thing to deal with an unfortunately more likely the first 2 years of a child\u2019s life as the grow and develop. Feel free to replay of pm any questions or just random parent stuff. Like mentioned, vomiting and being lethargic are the red flags. The other symptoms of a headache could be your little one crying if she is not tired or hungry. Watch for pulling of the hair or scratching. Good luck! Before the fontanelle closes, the head will bulge if there is too much CSF Ere the fontanelle closes, the headeth shall bulge if 't be true thither is too much csf\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Checking the soft spot and head measurements are other things you can look for as well that are not a cold related. We bought those head measurement devices and got the nurses to teach us how to use it. We also got them to show us how to feel the soft spot too. It is hard to explain but when our kid was in failure it was different than a cold, she was not \"with it\". She was lethargic and did not respond the way she normally does. We did not wait long to call the ER and ask for a neurosurgeon if we were unsure, waited like a day. It is just hard to tell, so do not feel bad about calling the ER. But I would suggest only calling the ER and asking for the neurosurgeon, in our experience others will tell you to go to the ER and not be helpful. We called when there were multiple signs that could be shunt related, not just one. Had some false alarms but being right once was worth it. My daughter had 2 revisions before she was 6 months old (she is 9 mo now), and it was SO hard to pick out symptoms like lethargy and vomiting (I cannot tell you how many hours my husband and I have spent analyzing where the line between spit up and vomit is).\n\nFor us there were 3 really consistent symptoms: persistent sun setting eyes for minutes at a time, bulging soft spot (including the back one before it closed), and fluid along the shunt track. It always started with the fluid, then her soft spot would gradually draw level with and protrude past her skull, and the sun setting would get worse and worse. There was never a moment for either of her revisions where I felt like we needed to rush to the ER, but rather everything together told us we needed to see the neurosurgeon. \n\nIn retrospect, she had basically every symptom possible except fever both times, but with such little babies it is so hard to say whether it is lethargy or a growth spurt making them tired, or what constitutes \"extra\" fussiness. Another symptom we could only pick out in retrospect that maybe your PT can help with is she would plateau on milestones in the week or two before a revision. For example, she had been making really good progress on propping on her tummy at about 4 months, then all of a sudden for a week or two no more progress. Our PT did not suspect anything at that point, but she was able to pick out a pattern leading up to both revisions when she went back through her notes. Oh my gosh this bot Shunt can fail anytime. Extreme sleepyness, excessive vomiting, extra fussy, bulging fontanelle. It sucks some of those are normal illness issues, but always worth getting an MRI to be safe. My little guy is almost 2 but his fontanelle is still our go to check for failure Thank you for writing this. I am also pregnant and reading how you have been able to live a pretty normal life is helpful.", "Color vision changes? Hi all \nHas anyone had change in their color vision due to hydro? The past 2 days it is like my right eye has a yellow tint to everything but my left eye is fine. I see my neurologist this afternoon (for a different reason) and plan to bring it up. The past few weeks so many things have happened out of the blue that I cannot figure out. If I put them all together it could point to etv failure or just be something else entirely.  I am just concerned now bc I have never had a vision color change like this When I first got my surgery for my shunt placement at 17, colors were more vivid to me. I cannot say there was any color change, but I did see them sharper. Ok As much as i know color changes in vision could indeed be due to hydrocephalus, so it would for sure make sense have this checked, maybe also by a MRI to see if the ETV still seems to work (\"flow void\" sign) Have you had any headaches? Or more headaches than usual? I have daily migraines (have for years) but they have recently gotten even more intense. I was red green colour blind for months and had no idea until I did the test. It turns out the pressure on your optic nerve can cause it. So I do not see why it could not cause this. Can you keep me updated on what happens, I have an ETV as well and there is not a lot of info on what symptoms are like if it fails", "New to the hydro issue Hi all, your stories on here are very inspiring - thanks for sharing. I am a mum to a 17yr old daughter who got diagnosed with a non-malignant brain tumour on January 6th this year, and as a result has severe hydrocephalus.  This resulted in surgery last Friday to do an EVT.  This was successful, however my daughter is due to go back to Uni on Monday as her holiday break is over.  I am really worried she will not be able to cope with the workload and walking to and from campus (she lives in Halls about 10 hilly minutes away) when she is only just had it done.  She extremely determined (read strong-willed) to get back into it but as a mum I am very scared that she is doing it too soon.  Any thoughts?  I am so new to all this it is a big old confusing nightmare.  Thanks so much. She will be just fine! If she is feeling up to it, let her go after it! I know it was important to me to fly under the radar on this sort of thing. It will be good for her to spend time with her friends as well. \n\nThe worst case scenario is she goes for a little while, realizes it is too much, and then comes back home for a while to her very loving mother. \n\nI understand your apprehension, but let her be the judge of her own body. I know I was back in classes 5 days after my ETV surgery. She will do great and be fine! I had etv surgery a couple weeks b4 finals in 2016. I too lived on campus in dorms. It was easy for me to jump right back into things after a day or two. It was my second brain surgery (first being initial shunt placement around birth). As long as she feels she is ready, you should let her go for it. She knows her body best. Thank you so much, I feel a lot better now about letting her do this.  Appreciate your time to reply. Thanks so much for replying.  I do feel a lot better now I have ready you comment and the one above.  So cool of you to take the time and reply. Your concern is not improperly placed. The surgery is serious, and sounds scary. I get it.\n\n However the recovery time is actually very quick. Faster than the most common surgeries like hernia repair surgery. I do not think you need to worry if the surgeon says its okay. \n\nI want to say I was also 17 when I had surgery (over 15 years ago)... I was very ready to get back to it after surgery with a much clearer mind than I had ever had. I have had hydrocephalus my whole life. I know that it is not the same as being diagnosed as a teenager, but there are things to look out for:  things she used to know how to do, on her own, she may need help with.  She may need to relearn a lot of things. It is brain damage. Www.hydroassoc.org has great information. They are based in Maryland, just outside DC. But they were founded in San Francisco, California. I grew up just north of San Francisco, and my family has been involved in that organization almost since it was founded. I am in my mid-30s now Kindness keeps the word going round. If I can help alleviate a lot a bit of stress from you, for 2 minutes of my day, I am happy to do so. \n\nHang in there! You are doing great Right back at you, you are obviously doing great too! Thanks so much, it is really kind of you to send through this information and the link.  I will check it out.  Stay well! Thanks so much for your reassurance.  I came here feeling quite concerned and you and the others have really helped. I had my VP Shunt surgery in my final year of university. I was very strong willed, I went to university 4 days after I returned home from the hospital. I personally think it probably was too soon, but it was also something that really motivated me to get better, accept support and recover. \n\nI probably would not have \u2018bounced back\u2019 quite like a did if I had not got back into university work and routine. Just make sure you check in with her regularly as the next 6-12 months of recovery are really important for long term wellbeing. \n\nThere is also accessible support groups/counselling on campus in many universities which I think your daughter would benefit from! I know they really helped me to accept what had happened, especially as my surgery came as a big shock. For context, I had a serious car accident causing my hydro! I had my first brain surgery at 21 due to a non-malignant brain tumor.  I went back to school and work a little over a week later.  She just needs to listen to her body.  If she gets tired she just needs to slow down a little.  I honestly think it is great that she wants to get back into the swing of things as soon as possible. I have had some of my surgeries during university, and personally, would really recommend she gets a bit of a break from school for now, even just 2-3 weeks.  She needs time to recover, and her professors and instructors would surely understand it.  Just my opinion, as I did find it overwhelming coming back into school immediately, less so due to physical aspects, but more that she will need time to get her head around everything. My son was diagnosed when he was 11. I was extremely anxious in the weeks before his shunt placement. It is now over 20 years later and we have spent a lot of time in hospitals (but not since 2014!!). \n\nIt is so scary as a parent to watch your child go through this and mine did not have a brain tumor to consider. I understand and appreciate your concern!\n\nAs others have said, your daughter will be fine. Let her go do her thing. Let her know you are there for her. Everything is going to be alright :) Awww thanks so much. Glad things are ok for you too. Thanks, I think the same but apparently mothers know nothing. She is a stubborn wee lass! Thanks so much, you are awesome. Keep well. Thanks heaps,  she reckons the other students on her floor (University halls) are great, so I am hoping so! I will be checking on her regularly, and I am a 90 min drive away thank goodness. That sounds very reassuring! I am sure university will be great for her recovery. I am guessing if she is 17, this is her first year of university? Which is usually the year where students focus on settling in, joining societies and learning the basics- so by the time the workload increases in second year she will be fully recovered (my fingers are crossed for you both). Best of luck! Mum, I think the fact that she is head strong and wants to return to Uni is a great thing. When  children have been diagnosed with medical issues a lot of the time, ***we tend to over think what is going on, and try to limit the things our kids can do. Plz do not do this.***\n\nWhen I was born (I am 66) in the 1950's there was no technology to find out if a baby in utero had Hydrocephalus, no CT-scans or MRI's of course. I was born looking like every other baby in the hospital. No enlarged head, no clear idea that I had Hydrocephalus at all. Sure, there were things my parents noticed  I had headaches even as a 4-5 yr old, severe nystagmus, I could not skip or hop like other kids, however, I was intelligent, did well in school. My parents took me to one of the best hospitals in the country when I was 5 yrs old. My mom said that the best advice the doctor they saw gave her was : \n\n***\"IF she can do something, she will. If she cannot she will not. All people know their limits, yes even people that have medical issues\"*** (even ones that were not diagnosed properly until I was 30 yrs old).\n\nWhat this doctor was trying to tell my parents was simple. He was trying to prevent my mom from turning into an OTT-over protective Mom which would not have done neither of us any good. She would have severely limited my physical and mental health had she hoovered over me constantly. Instead, I was allowed to do anything my younger sister did (18 months younger). Sure, it took me longer to achieve some things, (It took me 3 yrs to learn how to ride a two-wheel bike) but I went onto college, became a nurse with my Bachelor's Degree (BSN) I married, had the Fairy Tale life we all dream about, (he passed unexpectedly yrs ago) and I had 3 kids BEFORE I was shunted as well. (Our 4th child was born AFTER I was shunted)\n\n*PLZ allow your daughter to live her life*. You mention that her diagnosis is \"severe\" Hydrocephalus. Is that something the doctors termed (diagnosed)??? I was seen for years by the Professor &amp; Chair of Neurosurgery and he was rather shocked the first time he seen me. You see, he had my CT-scans in his hands and was a little shocked that I did not have a care-giver. At my 2nd appointment with this Chief Neurosurgeon he showed me my scans in comparison to another patient with almost identical scans ***who DID have a care-giver.*** This Chief Neurosurgeon referred to me ***as a miracle*** and also said that my parents were given EXCELLENT advice ***as far as not hoovering over me or trying to limit my activities because of an issue they had no clue diagnosis for at the time.*** *Even when I was diagnosed, I was not given any limitations (well, immediately after the shunt placement surgery I was told I could not lift 5 pounds for two weeks when I went back to work as an RN in the Emergency Room I worked at.)*\n\nI learned to play every single wind instrument in grade-school, JR high &amp; High School band. My coordination is a little off, so I do not play the drums LOL. I drive, I have had piano and singing lessons and have sung for years. I was a teen model, etc.\n\nMy advice to you is simple Mum....*just allow your daughter to go on living her life.* I promise if she has issues, she will let you know I am sure.\n\nGood luck and I think it is great your daughter is continuing to go to the University!!! YAY! Thanks - yes she is in her first year, so is making loads of friends which is also so supportive. You are so kind - best wishes to you too, and stay well.", "Anyone else struggle with their recovery post surgery? Hi, I will try to make a long story very short (PM me if you want more details) but I am 15 months post shunt revision and still struggling.\n\nI had a vp shunt placed at birth in 1984. In June of 2020, it finally failed. The doctors here in Spain tried to use the same shunt but could not.\n\nI now have 2 programmable shunts. I have had more problems with these than I ever had with my old shunt. I ended up spending 3 months in the hospital and I lost my ability to eat, drink, walk and talk normally.\n\nAfter I was discharged from the hospital, I started 6 months of speech and physical therapy 5 days a week. Luckily now I can walk, talk, eat and drink again.\n\nBut I am still underweight (I lost a dramatic amount of weight and had to be on a feeding tube)\n\nMy eye went cross eyed due to the the pressure from my shunt failure. I still walk unsteadily but I can walk. I cannot drive due to my eye. But I can do basically everything else.\n\nThis has been a long hard road for me and I still have a ways to go. I also had my first daughter during my illness (she is 8 months old now and the light of my life)\n\nI hope to eventually be back to the way I was pre surgery and I am lucky to be alive. Has anyone else struggled post surgery?\n\nTLDR: I am struggling with various health problems 15 months post shunt revision. I have never had complications that far out from a revision, but I have only ever had VP shunts placed, not programmable ones. My most recent revision was in March 2021 and I still have not gained the weight back that I lost. Otherwise, though, most of my symptoms have receded. \n\nI do not know much about programmable shunts, but you might confirm with a neurologist that your intracranial pressure is not still above whatever is \u201cnormal\u201d for you. I think you would know if the shunt was failing, but it is possible it might need adjusted and that might help with some of the prolonged symptoms you have experienced. \n\nCongrats on the birth of your child, though. :) I do hope you get answers soon and that you are able to continue to progress in your recovery from surgery. Thanks for the kind words. My daughter was honestly the only reason I made it through this. My doctors have done a CT scan and checked the pressure of the valves and everything seems normal. I guess it will just take me more time to get back to normal.", "Happy New Year! ", "ETV surgery recovery time? Hi Guys,\n\nI had an ETV exactly 4 weeks ago and i ve some questions about the recovery.\n\nThe good new is im mentally ok and i have no pain...the bad new is that im physically fragile. Even after a short walk i immediately feel that the pressure starts to increase in my head and i start to feel dizzy. Im a little worried because i will have to work again soon but im not able to...\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with how long it takes to recover?\n\nThank you in advance for your help. Hi there! I am just over 6 weeks post op from my ETV and personally I felt I turned a corner after 4 weeks post op.\n\nHowever, my neurosurgeon said it will take up to 3 months at best to feel back to normal.\n\nAs I understand it, the fatigue arises from the fact that the brain is so consumptive of energy and because it is still healing, it zaps us easily.\n\nI have slowly started working from home (I am a lawyer) and on Monday I went too hard doing work and house work and I was stuffed on Tuesday. We will have good days and bad but do not pressure yourself and listen to your body. \n\nWe owe it to our heads! Best of luck. Took me a while to recover but I think everyone is different. I had two invasive surgeries, and I did not feel physically back to normal until after about 6 weeks.\nMy workplace was good and let me phase in work gradually. Do not rush into things. Felt much improved about a week after surgery, but the rest of the recovery back to close to normal was pretty snail-paced. Took me about 6-8 months to be able to jog without inducing dizziness. 14 months out, I still feel like I am walking on a boat sometimes and get head pressure now and then. But feel a lot better and do believe the surgery was quite successful (MRI 1-year follow up agreed with that). I guess when the endoscope forges the hole in the floor of the third ventricle, there is a pressure release, and it takes a while for the brain to adjust to the new conditions/layout of your brain parts. \" im walking on a boat\" this is the best description of what i feel...yesterday i walked almost 2 km and it went pretty well...by the end i was tired and felt weak in my legs but i think this is acceptable 4 weeks after the surgery. I think this is an improvement :) I have had 2 shunt revisions and 1 replacement last 3 years, with the latest being in March when I got fitted with a Certas adjustable shunt. \n\nYesterday I had my ETV, because my neurosurgeon thought it would be my best option, as I have had severe headaches after getting the adjustable shunt put in. \n\nI see that there is quite a lot of difference in recovery times here, and I just hope my head and body will recover on the quicker side of things. I will visit my NS on monday and i hope i can start to work next week...i feel myself much better but im still fragile...im walking 3-4 km everyday but it still not so easy.\n\nGood luck to you \u270c\ud83c\udffb Thanks. So far the most pain is from the areas where they put the head frame/vice to hold it still that hurt the most. Especially sleeping has been an issue so far. Good drugs help though It will take only a few days dont worry. 4-5 days after the surgery i slept very well without any \u201chelp\u201d \ud83e\udd17 I often read about people with ETVs going ages to fully recover.  I often wonder if it is truly worth it. I ve read a few comments from you and it seems that you against ETV. Why? For adults and older children the etv is much better than shunt. Sometimes the success rate can reach the 90 + %. My surgery was only 7 weeks ago and i feel myself much better... im driving without any problem and yesterday i played tennis a few minutes. Im walking 4 km everyday so the progress is very good. Im very happy now \ud83d\ude00 That is not true.  ETV has basically the same failure rate as a shunt overall.  Personally  I feel the procedure leaves a lot to the unknown.  I have read a lot of people commenting on how bad their memory is after an ETV etc.  Scientists are only now finding out how csf gets to our brain and it is through the choroid plexus, the very bit that surgeons remove in an ETV/CPC. A lot of countries do not even perform this procedure. \n\nIf you take a look at the ETV fb group, then you would be very wary of doing an ETV.  Granted a lot of those people are ones who have issues already. As i wrote before there is a huge different between a child or an adult. (\n\nMaybe i was lucky because for me its 90+ %...the average ETV success rate is 73 % ( age 1+) infants...that is another question...:(\n\nI wont deny i felt short term memory problems in the first few weeks but now i think im ok...im working and i feel myself good Ps, an ETV is different than ETV/CPC (for other readers: combo of endoscopic third ventriculostomy and chorioid plexus cauterization). So in an ETV they do not cauterize the choroid plexus (the squiggly bits in your ventricles r/notscience).\n\nCould you link the ETV FB group? Cheers.", "I am lost Before my last revision 3 years ago, my shunt was malfunctioning for a lot longer than it should have been. I was experiencing symptoms for a while and hid them until it got really bad. I should have told my parents at the time, but I have always been one to keep to myself and let it get to me. This was going on for a couple years. I would get migraines and vomit once a month, than once a week, until it happened every day. I could not get surgery done right away, I lived in KS at the time and none of the neurosurgeons knew about hydrocephalus.\n\nWe ended up traveling to MI to where I got my first 15 surgeries done. The car ride was not terrible, I did not get the symptoms if i was in a complete lay down position. However a couple hours before my revision, I was experiencing extreme pain in my neck if I moved it an inch. The revision was successful sorta, I have not been getting migraines or vomiting.\n\nI am 19 now and have not been in the best mental state, I have gotten no where in life. I have severe anxiety, depression, memory loss, and cannot focus on anything. It is the worst when I am trying to learn something or am in a social environment, I constantly stumble over my words. I just want to feel normal again. Could there have been permanent damage done to my brain, since my shunt was malfunctioning for so long? and is there anything i can do?", "Can you help explain what to expect with fetus? We just found out at our 20 week ultrasound that our baby/fetus has 18mm bilateral ventriculomegaly, which is basically hydrocephalus...I cannot find anything concrete online.  What are the chances of survival till birth/after birth? Are they doing further testing? Ventriculomegaly can be caused by a few different things (which are more of a threat than the actual ventricle enlargement normally) but it can also just occur congenitally. In the later case, it normally fixes itself during the pregnancy. It also depends how enlarged the ventricles are. Keep in mind that I have not experienced this, I just did a bit of reading just now. Make an appointment with your doctor and ask all of these questions and anything else you are worried about. There is nothing wrong with making appointments until you feel comfortable with the answers you have received. Great questions.  the Ventricles are 18mm on both sides, plus the fetus has a VSD (Ventricular septal defect), or medium size hole in it is heart.  We did NIPT testing, which did not show any markers for the Trisomy's like Down's or Turners Syndromes. \n\nVentriculomegaly can go away (from what I have read), if it is under 12mm, but since both sides are at 18mm, so our doctor was very specific about it not going away any time soon.\n\nI have an appointment with a genetic counselor on Wednesday, I just want to go prepared with the right questions.  Thank you for your quick response! The further testing is probably what youre going to have to wait for here which sucks. I do not know much about the risks here for when it does not go down. I had a shunt implanted at 2 but I was not born with hydrocephalus. I will say that it can be rough sometimes because you can have frequent hospital stays for shunt issues and revisions. However, your child should still be able to lead a very normal life. I am 26 now and have had a completely normal life as far as education and working and everything goes, I just have surgery every few months. I wish you and your child all the best! Thank you!  This helps.  Are you happy?  I know the hospital stays sound like they suck, but other than that are you happy? Yeah I am! I had a very normal life. Went to school, started working part time when I was 14, moved out at 18, bought a house at 24 (when I finished honours) and I am now doing my PhD. Really the only difference is the hospital stays. They have been bugging me lately but I am just at a time of my life when it is hard to be off work so much and my surgeries have increased a bit which is not predictable. But really my life is completely normal. Honestly, until adulthood, this is going to be harder on you than your child. When I was in school, I told my mum I was sick and we went to hospital. Everything was someone else's problem. I was never worried about surgery, I trusted my parents and the doctors to deal with everything. I have hand held video games and TV and movies and played with kids in hospital and my siblings visited me a lot. But for my mum she had two other kids and had to be at hospital all the time with me. Plus as a single parent who could not work because I was sick, money was tough. I did not think about any of that though. My life was normal and fun in my eyes. So I would heavily suggest getting yourself and your partner into a support group and/or counselling. There will be help you can get but you need to find it and support groups will know where to look. My supervisor now has a child who is 7 and has had a shunt since she was 2 months old. They are obviously very stressed a lot of the time but I tell them the same thing. We (the kids) are really fine. Make sure you look after yourselves too. This is what I really needed to hear.  I can deal with me being stressed, but what I want most in life is for this little one to be happy.  THANK YOU SO MUCH! No worries =) I am heading back to hospital in a few hours actually haha. I will miss my dog but other than that it is fine haha. I hope the doctors can get you some results soon! Our story is similar in a way to /u/tittoilet. We knew she had hydrocephalus before birth but found out at 15 days that it was from a golf-ball-sized lesion compressing her brain stem. She is had 4 surgeries, had seizures and a large clot (basically a stroke) after her first surgery, but has had no cognitive developmental delays. \n\nPhysically she had some weakness on her left side and was a month or two behind her twin but she is 2.5 now and almost caught up. She has a larger vocab but her sister can run faster. If you put them side by side you would not be able to pick out the one that has hydro (apart from the shunt). I am so glad things are going so well! Thank you for the positive note ! Look up Dr. Kurtzberg at Duke and autologous umbilical cord blood stem cell infusions. She is had awesome results for hydrocephalus. The cord blood banking either free or heavily discounted when you know for sure that you are going to use the stem cells. \n\nThe procedure was around $10k when we did it but it gets discounted to $5k if your insurance does not cover it. They fought with our insurance for over a year and we ended up paying about $2k out of pocket. \n\nI think it was 3 or 4 days that you had to be at Duke. I think it was a Saturday-Tuesday. \n\nA friend of ours had their kid treated for CP with really good results and I feel it is part of the reason my daughter is doing so well.", "Has anyone had a revision during this ongoing pandemic? I had surgery back in October for the first time since I was a child (im 22) but it partially blocked shortly after and since then ive been living with a partially blocked shunt. I put off surgery initially due to the pandemic, but during my routine imaging done yesterday, they noticed my ventricles increased in size a little. My neurosurgeon said it is not an emergency given the small increase and no other symptoms besides headache / anxiety, but he did suggest I schedule surgery asap which I am going to do. This is only my 3rd revision in my life, so of course I am very nervous for serious complications, not waking up from surgery, etc. \n\nHas anyone had surgery during this time? was it different? Also, as a side note, how many revisions have you had? You are symptomatic? The situation in hospital  \nI had a surgery just some days ago due to HC. The situation that you face in hospitals may vary due to the restrictions that apply. I my case the main restrictions have been on visitors: They are restricted both in amount (two people over all te tme in hospital) and the visiting time (max 1/2 hrs in the afternoon).  \nThe most nasty thing is the protective mask which you are obliged to wear all the time when leaving your room.", "Vomiting a year post op Hi, I know intense vomiting is a sign of shunt failure but I want to know if anyone still has a problem with vomiting after a shunt replacement?\n\nI am one year post op, and I had 2 new programmable shunts placed. Well for the past year I have been vomiting on and off for no reason.\n\nThey have checked my shunts and they are working fine. Sometimes I can go weeks without vomiting and other times I will vomit 2 days in a row. It does not matter what I eat, it is not triggered by a specific food.\n\nI was on stomach acid suppressors which helped but my doctor took me off them because he said prolonged months of suppressing my stomach acid was not a good thing.\n\nI am at my wits end here. So annoying to have this problem. I would try and figure out if it is a separate stomach issue. Zofran is an amazing vomit stopping drug btw. How long have you had brain shunts if I may be so humble to ask anytime i have thrown up because of my shunt, food had nothing to do with it. moving too quickly/standing up/sudden motions of any kind usually resulted in it, though. however, the most recent time my shunt broke (March/April 2021), i had no issues with throwing up, so grain of salt and all that.\n\ni hope you get it figured out! I have been shunted since birth. So 36 years and counting. Thanks for the feedback Vomiting is a vague symptom, most of the time it is not going to be related to your shunt. I would try to see a gastroenterologist. I too have been throwing up very randomly for the last year, almost 2 now because it is taken me 8 months to get into the GI specialist. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night to vomit, mid conversation, very random times and at least 4 times a week. I had my shunt checked, have also had since birth but with no revisions. No issues they can tell. \n\nI could not let it pass without saying we are having similar symptoms. I definitely thought I have some freakish, only me illness. I will not lie, this is a great relief to me to know that I am not the only one going through this! I am going to the doctor again today to try and get this figured out. Feel free to PM me for more information if you want. May i ask what you mean by \"mid conversation\"? I remember one night when i was waking up and had to vomit. And i always again and again had to throw up depending how i positioned my head. I would not have had any time to react (for example get a bowel)\n\nDo you \"feel\" when its coming or does \"mid conversation\" mean that it could also happen almost instantly with no time to react? In the middle of the night it is pretty instant. I only gag maximum 2 times before I am throwing up. When I say mid conversation I mean I will be talking to somebody and just start gagging in the middle of my sentences. Sometimes it takes me a good 4 tries before I can get my sentence fully out. It is not instant when im distracted (ie: more gagging before vomit when I am talking) but is definitely pretty instant at night and when I first wake up. Elaborating further because I feel like I did not answer your question clearly lol. When it is mid conversation, I will be talking and just randomly start to gag, sometimes not even being able to finish my words. When it happens while I am talking I will usually just uncontrollably gag for about a minute with nothing coming up. I have thrown up mid conversation but it seems as though it is more gagging when I am distracted. \n\nAt night however is a whole separate story. I will be fully asleep and start to become consciously aware that I feel like I am about to throw up. Will not even have my eyes open yet and I am jumping up with vomit in my mouth trying to get to a trash can. It does not seem to get better/worse for me with certain positions. The food I eat does not seem to affect the throwing up, it has no clear trigger or pattern at all. All anti nausea medicine I have tried does not help. \n\nJust like OP, I am very over this. My esophagus is starting to take damage as well, it feels like there is fire in my chest now if I lay too flat. My vomiting almost always happens before or after meals (but no specific food triggers that I can tell) I also had grade 2 (out of 4) damage in my throat due to all the vomiting. The doctor gave me medicine to heal the damage but im not sure if it is fully healed or not.\n\nAt this point my doctor has basically given up and told me that I will just have to deal with the random vomiting unless their are other symptoms. This sucks. Just thought I would post an update. I am 10 days post op now and finally got all my stitches out. After 2 years of nothing but problems I am actually feeling pretty good.\n\nThey replaced one shunt and one catheter completely. All my random vomiting has stopped. I hope this is the last surgery I will need for a long time. This is my 4th operation in 18 months after going 35 years without any problems.", "Quick Update So a year ago I discovered that my VP shunt tube had broken into two pieces. Went and saw my neurologist and he said \u201cwe have seen this happen plenty of times before. Normally the CSF will continue to flow in the tube path without complications.\u201d So far so good. I just went back 2 days ago for a follow up and it was discovered that the tube broke in another location so I have about a 1 foot long piece completely disconnected. Still have not experienced any symptoms as far as headaches, nausea, etc\u2026\nAt my appointment the other day he said \u201cif you are not experiencing any of the severe symptoms, let us act like this never happened because I do not want you to worry because it seems like you are okay.\u201d And I agreed.\nMy main concern is that one of the broken spaces is right above my right ear &amp; there is about a 1 inch gap from where the tube has spaced out. The only \u201csymptom\u201d I am experiencing is pressure changes in my right ear like I am changing altitude in a plane. Nothing major and nothing painful\u2026 I just find it odd that it is occurring right where the tube has split. Could this be a sign of pressure build up/fluid build up? \nI am only asking on here because it was not occurring on the day of my appointment and I completely forgot to bring it up when talking to my Doctor. \ud83e\udd26 I would definitelt put a call in to your doctor and let him know.  I have heard of instances of the tube in the abdomen becoming damaged or disconnected, but not in the head.  I would think that is not a good thing since the tube is meant to move the CSF out of the brain region.  If it is disconnected in the brain region, fluid can build up there.  Unless I am misunderstanding.  But, I would definitely call and would push for a repair.  That is just me. (Mine malfunctioned 4 years ago, pressure built up and I lost my sight as a result.) So there is about 6-8 inches of tube still connected to the shunt. So if it were to be filling up in my head region, it would be on top of my skull and not on the brain itself I assume. And just to clarify; did you regain your vision after getting it fixed? Or what is it permanent? Unfortunately, I did not regain my vision. Is it in just one or are both eyes permanently damaged? Is it 100% blindness or partial?\nSorry to be asking so many questions, I just never knew you could lose eyesight when dealing with complications I have had my shunt snap and they chose to revise it straight away so I am not sure why your doctors are choosing differently. I did pass out though. I remember waking up that day and going over to my desk, then I remember waking up in my bed again several hours later but with a bump on my head and I would bit the side of my tongue. I had no memory of what had happened. Later that day I noticed a big lump on the side of my neck, my mum (I was 15) said it felt like fluid so we went to the ED.  They did a CT, found the break and operated right away. No waiting at all, like I did not even really know what had happened until I was waking up from surgery. This was 15 years ago though so maybe the ideas around it have changed. I am not sure either. He said \u201cwe do not want to have to operate unless absolutely necessary because every time we do any type of surgery, we risk infection.\u201d\nOn my post last year someone stated their tube is also in multiple pieces and they did not get surgery so I guess it is a case by case situation?\nMy tube is broken right above my right ear and then right at my collarbone. He stated that since I have had it since I was 4 months old (now 24yrs old) that scar tissue would have built up around the tubing and created a sort of \u201cnatural\u201d tube path. I really have not experienced any symptoms other than the VERY slight pressure change in my right ear every so often.", "Should I bring all 1000+ pages of records to my appointment? I recently had a bout which led me to the ER which they had me to a Cat Scan and told me to make a neurologist. (Which I did its this Friday) I had the same situation occur about a year ago. But the neurologist said that I was fine. Now I do know things change... Especially in an entire year. My concern is that this time (different doctor) they will say the same thing. I am just concerned that they are not/will not take it seriously... Especially after my last surgery where I almost died twice. It all depends on your doc.\n\nI use EVERNOTE to basically organize my life. What I did was prepare a basic outline , but embedded links to PDF copies of test results , just in case my doctor wanted to read them.\n\n(As it turns out, she did, and thanked me repeatedly for having everything prepared like that because it meant she did not have to go digging for it.)\n\nBut I think it all really depends on the doctor. I suppose I could ask if it could be helpful. Or just bring it and ask if they want it. In the past 6 months my Dr. retired. My ventricles have never changed since being shunted at 30 yrs old. I see a new doctor who talked about doing an EVT procedure and I declined simply because the last round of surgery to change the VP shunt turned into a 58 day stay in Neuro ICU and the last surgery was a Codman--Hickman Programmable Shunt. So, I continue to have issues even though I did decline the EVT. I went back to the doctor on a scheduled appt....and now this Joker tells me that Voila!!! My CT-scan looks AMAZING? Really? After being told for 30 plus years (I am in my 60s now) that the size of the ventricles have NEVER changed? \n\nI am disgusted by the entire Neurosurgery Dept of this well-known hospital in Michigan to say the least. I have severe headaches EVERY single day, and vomiting 6-8 times a day, but my \"ventricles\" are better than they have ever been?  I do not know what the hell this doctor is trying to pull here....but I am in the process of looking for another Neurosurgeon to see and just to let ppl know, I do not as a rule doctor shop.", "Weird pressure in head/ears when laying on stomach or bending down Has anyone every experienced a pressure feeling in their head and almost like they cannot hear when lying down on their stomach or bending down. I had a CT scan done and the neurosurgeon said my ventricles/shunt looked fine. Could it be low pressure? Usually low pressure headaches get worse when standing/sitting or bending over and better while lying flat. I get that too when I wear over the ear headphones for too long I have always had that. I was told it was a symptom/ side effect of having a shunt. To me it feels more like underdrain, with throbbing around the valve, so I imagine it is to do with the tubing getting stretched and tugged by the position. I had this before I was ever treated with anything", "Question So this is my first brain surgery without my parents doing everything for me. Is there anything I should do, being to the hospital or even anything I can make. I am very artsy and live making things  I do not have any real advice because I am still in HS and my surgeries have all been unplanned emergencies, but I would bring colored pencils and an adult coloring book, and for god's sake do not forget your chargers! Comfort snacks and puzzle books are in my 'for hospital' bag. And comfy sweats. Seconding the chargers too!! Bring your insurance card(s)\n\nComfortable loose clothing\n\nSomething to keep you occupied (probably will not be able to do much in this regard for the first 12-24 hrs after surgery, but it is nice to have for the longer stays)\n\nSlippers\n\nAny medical equipment you might be using (CPAP etc.)\n\n What is your age? You should bring your drivers license and insurance card. Last year I had to have surgery 3 separate times with one of them being a two week stay in the neuro icu due to a shunt infection and a long charging cable was a lifesaver. A ten foot one was able to reach my bedside table. Chapstick for your lips, the air in the rooms are really dry. A fan that you can clip onto a desk was also a lifesaver, I was able to clip it to the end of the bed and have it point at me at night when it would get hot. Earplugs at night because the nurses at the desks are NOT quiet at night. I have books to read and my boyfriend always brings my charger I have sweat pants and a \"hospital bag\" too I do not use slippers I usually always have socks on I turned 21 in June. I want a 10 foot charger!! I have a chap stick no fan tho. Had to go to the store because while my boyfriend and his sister were playing games I got a fever when I fell asleep. Already before that I was in allot of pain from my shunt and I was cold hungry and nauseated That is great that you are not doing this completely alone.   Yes plus my mom and dad are coming to Houston for my surgery a pad/pen to keep notes with so that you can:\n- keep track of what meds you have been given and when, just in case something does not play nice.\n- write down any questions you may have for your doctors but may forget in a painkiller fog.\n- distract yourself with drawing I take notes and write down EVERYTHING. even when my boyfriend got me a job where he is works. Everyone said I was official because I was taking notes during the training part", "Problems Me and my boyfriend have a theory. An uneducated theory but non the less a theory. Our theory is that is getting clogged somewhere staying clogged for a period of time then resuming and the \"bad days\" that I have are a result of that and my \"good days\" are when it is working. We were at the store just now and I kept getting this feeling that there was pressure in my head then it stops and comes back. This is based purely from what he sees and what I experience I have wondered this actually as some days I have definitely felt more tired, headache  and like my mind is kind of cloudy Idk mine gets worse every day Another theory that could work here is that some days you are circulating cerebral spinal fluid at a greater rate than usual. Maybe your shunt just is not keeping up. I am not a neurologist though and am just expanding on your thought. So sometime is pumps faster??", "Hey guys, I just got an MRI back and looks like I got some extra fluid up there in my brain, have any of you had visual disturbances/tinnitus?  What kind of visual disturbances are you having? I have had so many it is incredible. From sparks of light, to shadows in my peripheral vision, auras around people and objects, to what looks like water running over everything. ", "What should I expect when I go in for a dye test? So, I went to my neurosurgeon and he suggested doing a dye test to see if the tubing of my shunt is blocked. I have a huge fear of needles and I am wondering if it will hurt when I get it done and what to expect in general. Like with any shot, you will feel a small pinch when they inject the dye. \nIf it is anything like how mine was, you basically just lie down or stand up (I cannot remember which) until the dye runs its course. I do not recall feeling the actual flow of dye, so no need to worry there. Good luck! When I was a little kid, they did one on me, but they put me under and they did it weird. When I woke up, I thought since they would put me under, there would be SOME sign of what they did, but they did not even put a bandaid anywhere. Can someone explain what is a dye test? Is it the dye used during an MRI or CT scan? It is a dye that your neurosurgeon apparently injects into the tubing to see if the flow of fluid is blocked. The solution that they inject is dyed to be able to see it flow in real time on whatever imaging they are using to see it (from what I have read). I forget the medical term for it. I remember the crunching sound but it was not painful. How did you go?", "Indoor skydiving and VP shunts Hi all,\n\nI just saw a thing on TV about a local place that does \"indoor skydiving\" - basically you go into a vertical wind tunnel, and it simulates the experience of skydiving. I have spina bifida and VP-shunted hydrocephalus, and while I know the real thing is probably out of the question due to the hydrocephalus ... would *this* pose any problems? Why do you think it is out of the question? What would happen? Could the sudden pressure changes damage the shunt somehow? That is my concern, yeah. Hi man! I have a VP shunt with hydrocephalus. I went indoor skydiving about 2 years ago. No ill effects whatsoever! :) Go enjoy it, its quite fun! \n\nIf you just want clarification, maybe ask your neurologist if they have any concerns before you go do it? \n\nHave fun!! I have VP shunt (not SB tho) and have done outdoor skydiving! I am very intrigued now! I have got some digging to do. I also have hydro but not SB. I have gone skydiving twice and I enjoyed it so much. I hope to go many more times with family. Feel free to send me a PM with any questions you have.", "Hydrocephalus and poor memory I am 38.  Basically I have been told my entire life that my poor memory is likely, although not explicitly, caused by my hydrocephalus.  Lately, I am very much struggling with a sensation that feels like having short-term thoughts sucked from my brain.  Curious if anyone else out there in this community is also struggling with such a thing.  Just had an exam in March, all is well with my existing VP shunt.  I am definitely worried that early-onset dementia is in my future. Anecdotally, I would try not to worry about early onset dementia. Dementia is degenerative where as aHydrocephalus is also more the manifestation of a structural or flow issue. We all generate and circulate cerebrospinal fluid. With hydrocephalus the absorption and secretion are is unequal. What caused your hydrocephalus and how long before it was treated are where you are more likely to find the answer to your question more so than the existing hydrocephalus condition. You should reach out to your neurologist. They are going to be able to address your concerns more accurately based on your medical history much more accurately than a stranger can. The struggle is so extremely real! Weirdly I did not have this problem when I was shunted, but it became an issue after they replaced my second shunt with an ETV.They will not say if my Hydro has anything to do with it though. My kid has hydrocephalus. Sometimes he calls me five times with the same question, about 10 minutes apart. Just like dealing with someone with Alzheimers. That was when his shunt was not working very well.\n\nA long story, very short....we got him a Syphsea (sp?) shunt and he got a lot better. I guess US docs do not like that brand of shunt, but it is popular in Europe. He has not been hospitalized since he got it.\n\nI was told that the memory problems were actually caused by the shunt more than anything. I guess the shunt goes through that area of the brain? I am not sure, but short term memory issues are definitely a thing with this ailment. Having a shunt is so tricky because not every hydro experience is similar. \nI was discussing that with my disability specialist today because he is helping me with my SSI/SSDI application. I have always struggled with short term memory. And am in my teens. I think I can relate to this but for me my thoughts are more like bubbles that get bigger then pop. I lose my train of thought completely.  This happens all the time and it is super annoying. My ability to recall random moments from ages ago surprises me, but I will often have to be shown how to accomplish a relatively simple task multiple times. I am horrendous with names but can usually remember faces. I am pretty good with names/faces, and with long-term memory as well.  But say at work for instance.  I do IT for a living.  If I am working on an item, and someone comes into my office an asks me something, after they ask, I have zero idea what the hell  I was doing.  It is definitely affecting my ability to work as effectively as I would like, and it is causing me to forget tasks and miss deadlines completely.", "How many surgeries and revisions and visits to the Neuro-ICU should someone with hydrocephalus expect and thus save up money for in a country without any insurance system? I live in Bangladesh and there are absolutely no private or public insurance systems. The ones that are there, pay only a nominal amount, do not cover pre-existing conditions or over 65 years and do not cover many diseases and definitely not chronic illnesses. \n\nAnd everything must be paid out of pocket in cash in both public and private hospitals, before they will treat you. If you run out of cash they will pull you up from the ventilator. So you need to get an estimate and save up. \n\nNow I have heard that for those with hydrocephalus, revision of the surgery is common and so is visit to the Neuro-ICU. \n\nMy question is: For someone with hydrocephalus, for how many surgeries and revisions and days in Neuro-ICU should one expect and thus save up? It really depends on the person, sorry to say. In 18 years, I have had 3 revisions after the initial placement of my shunt. Some people have had over 100. I do not know if this is for you or not, or if you have been newly diagnosed or if you have had hydrocephalus for a long time. Maybe consider an ETV instead of a shunt if you are considering treatments and have not actually had anything done yet. If successful, there is a lot less that can go wrong with an ETV because there is not really any hardware to block up or break. It can still have problems, and it is a newer treatment so less is known about it, but it is worth considering. What is the full form of ETV? If its Endoscopic third ventriculostomy, I thought lots of people are not eligible for it. Wikipedia also seems to be saying that its extremely risky and the failure rate is much higher than a shunt. My husband who is 40 never had a revision from his shunt that was placed at age two.  Upon his last visit though they did tell us this is very uncommon. my understanding is that at least the part about not everyone being eligible is true. my sons hydro was caused by bleeding in his brain at birth, and the membrane that reabsorbs csf is plugged up from the clotting. an etv would not have worked for him. I recently met a rep for a company that produces shunts and he said their products typically last at least 10 years and usually not function more than 20. I will be at 20 years next summer since my last revision at age 8. Yeah. It has a much higher failure rate, but if it works, it is better for not having repeat surgeries. Are there any neurosurgeons familiar with Hydrocephalus in your area that you can ask? Or maybe if you want people's opinions for amounts of surgeries and cost and stuff, try a Facebook group. Those tend to be more populated than Reddit. Likewise, I am 22 and had mine placed at 7 months with no revisions either. When I tell people about my condition and they ask \"when will you need more surgery?\" / \"how often does it need to be replaced ?\" Or some variant of those type of questions, I simply respond:\n\n \"How long's a piece of string?\"\n\n There is all sorts that can go awry so it is impossible to know. Thankfully I am a patient of the UK NHS so I have never had to think about the financial side, except for when finding travel insurance.\n\n There is \"one and done\" people, and others who have dozens, and others, like me, who are in between, with more than a few but less than the number of years we have had it!\n\n At 28y7m old, having first been shunted at 10m, I am on shunt 6 with times between each ranging from 16y to 23 hours. Shunt 6 will be 8yo in October and I am currently  having intermittent issues.\n\nThe stats i see/hear a lot are along the lines of 20-30% fail within the first year, and 95% need to be revised within 10y. Could you expand on the travel insurance thing? How much trouble do you have finding travel insurance? Oh shit. I am at 29 years on the last one. I have always felt like I was on borrowed time :) Best example of the issue for me was about five years ago when I went on a long weekend trip to Amsterdam with five girlfriends. Range of ages was only 22 to 24 - I was 23 (just over two years after last revision) - and they all got single trip insurance from big brands (mostly through comparison sites) for about \u00a35. \n\nWhen I went through the comparison sites, if I wanted hydrocephalus to be covered, the quotes started at \u00a355 for two star cover - best price for five star was about \u00a370. \n\nI found a specialist insurer through our national SB and Hydro charity's website and I have used them a few times now. For a 4-5 day trip in an EEA country (I have never gone outside of Europe) it is usually \u00a318-\u00a325 for 'silver' cover - I pay about 4x the avg person would and I am limited to using a few specialist insurers.\n\nI am quite worried about what will happen post-Brexit if the 'deal' does not include continuation of the European Health Insurance for UK citizens as I am guessing it will make the cover even pricier. What Facebook group or online forum would you suggest? What is a national SB?\n\nWhat would happen if you wanted to travel to a developing country like say Tanzania, where you are more likely to need to be evacuated to a developed country a long distance away in order to get the minimum standard treatment required? How much would the insurance cost than? Sorry, SB= spina bifida.\n\nI think the insurance would be extra pricey for that - it is probably difficult for someone who does not have an existing condition to get decent cover in countries lacking the resources as you are more likely to need emergency transport out to somewhere better equipped!\n\nBecause I have experienced how quick things can go from seemingly fine to rushing to the operating room, I have just sort of ruled out travel too far from a major city. I have had Hydrocephalus since birth, and was shunted for the first time at age 6. Between age 6 &amp; age 32, I had 2 different shunts &amp; a total of 3 revisions between the two of them. While shunted, I landed in the Neuro ICU only once.\n\nLast Summer, at age 32, my second shunt failed, and they replaced it with an ETV. I spent the night of that surgery in the Neuro ICU. I am 27 and I have had a total of 26 shunt revisions with two of them landing me in Neuro ICU. I work in the surgery department where my neuro surgeon works at. The first time I was in the ICU I had a pocket of fluid at the distal end of the shunt where it was not being absorbed into the peritoneum. They drew the fluid off of the pocket and found bacteria. So they externalized the shunt for two weeks and then put a new system in. This last time, which was back in July of last year, I had a revision and two weeks later, I had CFS leak around the incision on my head. I called my doctor and he told me to come to the hospital. That time, I was once again in Neuro ICU for two weeks while the shunt was externalized. This is a picture I snapped on the CFS being collected.  I am booked in for an ATV in a few weeks. I am in Australia though and understand it is the treatment if choice for people like me with obstructive hydrocephalus", "Our story with Hydrocephalus I promised myself I would write this one day to hopefully help one desperate family in need of reassurance. Our beautiful and healthy baby boy was born on March 16th, 2019 and our life changed on May 6th, 2019. I got a call from my wife that Monday morning in a panic that our son was having a seizure and she was not sure what to do. I told her to hang up and dial 911 and she did just that. I ran out of my office and took an Uber straight to the hospital. I did not know the severity of things at the time but I had a bad feeling. When I arrived, I was told our son had a brain hemorrhage in the middle of his brain and that they did not have the proper equipment to help him. He was rushed to Lurie Children's Hospital where they could help him. They did another quick MRI before pulling us into a room to share the results. What we were looking at was pretty serious, there was quite a lot of blood in the middle of our son's brain and the doctor's were not sure he would make it or what the future held for us. My wife and I were a mess, we could not believe what was happening. The only bright side was that the hemorrhage occurred right next to one of the ventricles and the blood seemed to be seeping in there. This was causing damage in the ventricle, therefore causing hydrocephalus. They decided to take him to emergency surgery to put in an external ventricular drain (EVD) to try to filter the blood out.   \n\n\nWe proceeded to spend the longest 5 weeks of our lives in the hospital. When I tell you this was the toughest moment of my life, it would be an understatement. Hours upon hours spent doing research online, seeing pictures of kids online with hydrocephalus, reading horror stories, etc. Let me start right there by telling you, just do not do it. It is okay to read about hydrocephalus in a medical sense to get accustomed to the medical terms so that you can have educated conversations with the doctors, however, outside of that, just stay away from the stories/pics. It will scare the crap out of you. EVERY SINGLE CASE IS DIFFERENT. Seeing our child barely awake, with wonky eyes, barely responsive was absolutely heartbreaking. It goes without saying that each of us handle things differently. My wife and I included. As a mother, she simply took it a lot harder and consequently took it out on me harder. Being in a room for 5 weeks together and never leaving tested our relationship in every way. We were just scared, uncertain about the future and frankly going insane with cabin fever. However, neither of us could leave without feeling guilty. Thank God for our amazing families that visited just about every day and brought us home cooked meals and clothes. I will forever be grateful (the 1 hour commute each way is not easy).  \n\n\nFast forward past SO MANY meetings with doctors, frustrating days of no real answers, tears, etc and they came to the decision to put in a shunt in our son's head. The EVD did all it could and the spinal fluid coming out as no longer showing blood in it, however, the ventricle had too much damage and was not working properly on it is own. My wife and I were so sad, we did not want a device in our son's head, especially because he had been showing such promise with the EVD. When they did the surgery and we saw our kid for the first time, we were taken back. The device looked SO big in his head. Mind you he is only 11 weeks old at this point so that was a big factor we were not thinking about at the time.  \n\n\nAfter the shunt was installed we went home and life was different. Our son still is not fully all \"there\". His eyes are still wonky, he has a bit of a lazy eye that developed, he would cry randomly. My wife and I were so cautious and short tempered with each other. Any little thing the one or other did would set us off because we were just living in fear. Fear that this would happen again. Life was hard for months, VERY hard. We still had no idea what the long term effects would be. All we knew is we had so many follow up appointments scheduled we needed to figure out with our work schedules.  \n\n\nNow the good news, our son is 7 months old as of 10/16/19. He is a big, strong, happy and healthy boy. He weighs 22lbs and is 28 inches long which is 90th percentile on both fronts. His head has grown, the shunt is barely visible under his hair, his lazy eye has corrected itself, his overall senses are sharp. We have had follow up visits and MRI's at the hospital and there is no blood left in his brain. He was also monitored for seizures and he has not had any. His shunt level has been lowered to the lowest possible setting meaning he barely needs it anymore. I look back at everything we went through and I could have never guessed this is where we would be. After all the horror stories, pictures, emotions, meetings with doctors, etc. this is the best possible outcome for us. We still do not know for sure what will come in the future, however, we are beyond blessed and happy.  \n\n\nIf you are reading this and you are in a similar situation. Please understand that every child's situation is different. Some kids have not been as fortunate as my son, others have done even better. However, your attitude about this all will determine a lot. Please be kind to your partner. Please read the medical terms and stay away from the pictures/horror stories. Do all you can to take care of your own mental health during this time (it will go a long way). Please be patient and understand this will take time. I wish you nothing but luck with your child. Please feel free to DM me with any questions and I will try my best to help! Hey thank you for this post. Glad your boy is doing well \u263a\ufe0f. My son had hydrocephalus because he was born early.

But I am angry because my neurosurgeon did not explain anything to my parents about meningitis I got at 6 months.  Memory problems are fairly common. I am constantly stuck in the \u201cwhy did I walk into this room for\u201d. It affects my job a good deal. You are not alone. I struggle with the same problem, sometimes forgetting something someone told me not even a minute ago. It gets in the way at my job, which is frustrating. I try to combat forgetfulness by writing down *everything* that I need to do. Or I will put whatever I need to remember in my Notes app or in the calendar on my phone.\n\nBut your doctor has no right to tell you to \"try harder\" in my opinion. They are not living your life. They cannot fully understand the struggles that JUST hydro can inflict on you I strongly encourage you to connect with your local disabled community define people who have hydrocephalus and like their doctors. I retired in 2007 after 30 plus years of medical practice. Due to the activity of the insurance companies when I retired I was expected to do five times as much work for an hour's pay with half as much support. And for that hours paid I was paid one-third of what I had been paid 14 years before.\n\nThere is a law, the mccarran-ferguson act, passed in 1946, that exempts the insurance industry from all federal antitrust laws. So far only the state of California has managed to pass antitrust laws on the insurance industry. So basically the insurance industry can do whatever they want. It hurt the patient's. They hurt the providers.  And, as kyrsten sinema and Joe manchin have so horribly illustrated, corporations have complete control of Congress thanks to the 2010 citizens united supreme Court decision.\n\nHowever, most people that go into healthcare want to help people. You just need to find someone who clicks with you and who is not too burnt out. You may have to interview several. I saw 10 primary care doctors before I found one that I could work with.\n\nIf you have not had neuropsych testing, I would try to get that through my insurance.

I was hoping the silver lining to having an etv surgery and.a brain tumor would be that the reduction of pressure would eliminate my.migraines that started about two years ago. But two days ago i got what seemed to be a migraine aura and after taking tynenol the headache hit but it wasnt that bad. But now im paranoid that i still have migraine headaches. Is there any way to differentiate migraines from hydrocrphalus headaches? I know i still have some fluid in my ventricles, my etv was about a month ago july 30th and my tumor removal was august 17th. Just be patient, it takes a while to be able to figure it out, you are only a month out of surgery!  Some things to keep in mind are the following, but ultimately you need to get to know you body and your responses to things. It might be worth it to keep a headache journal to figure out your specific triggers!\n\n1. Duration: If my headache lasts longer than a week, then I start to worry, think about checking it out with my Dr. I have never had a non-benign headache last longer than 8 days.\n2. Weather/Altitude changes: Large changes in barometric pressure can cause migraine, and those of us with hydro/ TBIs are more sensitive. Check out \"migraine forecasts\" in your area.\n3. Stress/Mental State: Be mindful of what is happening in your life, stress can bring on headaches that are not caused by hydro. (Upcoming presentations, big events in your life etc)\n4. Body state (Did you work out or run? For ladies, are you anywhere near your period?): A big workout can cause headaches for me, particularly long or intense workouts like running/lifting heavy weights. Periods and PMS can also cause migraines.\n5. Diet: Make sure you are eating lots of fruit/veg, drinking water (dehydration will give anyone a headache!), getting enough potassium etc. I have recently started taking turmeric daily, which is anti inflammatory, and I think I have been seeing a difference. Tldr: Shit in == Shit out. Also, MEAL PREP! (one starch, one veg, one protein).\n6. Sleep: BIG one. Try to get at least 8-9 hours a night. Try to practice good \"sleep hygiene\" (google it). Sleep in a DARK room. Cooler room temp (with a cozy blanket) has been shown to promote better quality of sleep than in a warmer room.\n7.

I am 24 and thankfully I am close to John Hopkins hospital, I had a shunt placed in 7 months ago, and 2 months after having it put in I started to have headaches. I have no other symptoms, just a constant 24/7 headache. My neurosurgeon first thought I was on the wrong setting so tried all of them but now he thinks it is partially blocked. It was replaced 7 months ago after I had headaches for 3 years, similar to these, so it was partially blocked for 3 years. I am having surgery in a month or two, but just curious, has anyone dealt with the same? Living with a partially clogged shunt? I hear about people dying due to blocked shunts but I am guessing that is when it is fully blocked and ventricles are big. \n\nI had a ct scan last month that showed no change in my ventricles size, but I am guessing that if mines blocked it is partially blocked or the fluid is draining a little somehow... very odd. I have been through something similar. I had two revisions in June of 2000 (first shunt lasted a day, second lasted a week).  After the second shunt failed I had similar conditions - I had constant severe headaches and vomiting unless I was upright. Unfortunately due to a number of issues (including 1. My NS being on vacation, and 2. His office screwing up and sending over the wrong paperwork) it took almost a month to finally get fixed.  \n\nAfter my CT scans showed everything \"normal\" despite my symptoms I begged my NS to do more surgery as I was mostly non-functional at that point.  He did a shunt series and discovered a blockage at the distal end, and replacing the entire shunt resolved the issue.\n\nNeedless to say I can deeply sympathize, it took me about 3 years after that final revision to get back to \"normal\" and I do not ever want to go through that again. I think it really depends on why you have a shunt. \n\nFor example, I have a benign tumour blocking\u2019s one of my ventricles, and I have not had a revision in decades.  Try not to worry too much, but stay in regular contact with the surgeon regarding your systems.  \n\n Life is what you make of it and it is important for you to cherish each moment.", "Able to feel the shunt This question is probably mostly for people who have had shunts put in or replaced later in life. Can you feel it? I had my first shunt at 4 months old and a new one at 17. The new one's valve is so much smaller but whereas I could never feel the old one probably cause I barely knew life without it, its been four years and I have always been able to feel this one. It is irritating and while it does not hurt it makes me fidgit my neck, head and shoulder a lot cause I can feel it slightly as I move. I cannot say much about the shunt itself because that should not really be moving much, but the tube running down your neck sort of \"grafts\" to the muscle and when you grow it can disconnect from the muscle, and when you stop growing as fast it re grafts to it is new spot. I am sorry I cannot give a solution, best speak to your neurosurgeon about this, but at least now you know what it is you may be feeling in your neck. I mean, I could have also misconstrued what your actual question was and you may already know this, I will leave it here in case someone else needs it Kind Of just asking if anyone else can feel their shunt in their neck. Not touching it with a hand but your neck skin can feel it Tbh I just got home from work and am tired so I may still be reading this all wrong, but I think that is what I meant (?). When I turn my head I can sometimes feel it press against my skin, but it is not too bad. If it is super irritating then you should probably check with your ns at your next checkup (or sooner if it is bad enough) because their could be something else going on.

Hello,\n\ndoes anyone else here feel pressure on the ears when having issues with hydrocephalus? It actually feels like the pressure behind the eardrum (like driving up a hill).\n\nWhat conerns me even more, very often its not only a feeling of pressure but also like there is actually fluid right behind the eardrum and even sometimes it feels like there is a fluid running down on the back of my throat. \n\nI told all of this my neurosurgeons but their reaction was very different: Some said it is possible that this is actually csf (caused by a csf leak), while others said its \"almost impossible\" (making me feel kind of embarrased since this was during a morning round in the hospital with all the people staring at me)\n\nSince i have this two mri studies were made but neither the radiologists nor the neurosurgons could find any indications that there is actually csf in my ears, however both saying that it may just not be visible on the mri.\n\nDid anyone of you have something like this? This is definitely something you deal with having hydrocephalus! Before I was diagnosed, I had super intense pressure build up in my ears accompanied by a humming noise. I had an ETV and knew it failed because the pressure and noise were back in my ears. \n\nYou are not crazy, it is definitely something that happens with hydrocephalus.

Last Christmas, after a slip and fell on wet floor where he smacked his head, my 4 years old son was diagnosed with hydrocephalus (after several visits to the ER where they ruled out concussion each time and after much assistance they finally made a scan and MRI, thanks C***d for low hospital ressources). On the scan, they spotted 2 large aranoid cystes, a subdural hematoma and the hypothesis is that one leaked CSF following the fall creating the hematoma. \nAfter transfert to another specialized hospital, he was given corticoides with the hope to avoid surgery. Back home for a week but as soon as the corticoides were over, symptoms came back. \nFirst surgery was decided but only a catheter was placed (no valve), which is the common procedure at this hospital (the idea is that it can be done passively as pressure between the head cavity and the peritoneal one equilibrate themselves, which seems to work most of the time). But it did not happen, he was not able to seat afterwards, triggering almost immediately headeach and vomit. Photophobia still there. Under constant strong pain killers. Worse than before the surgery. Surgeons explanation : overdraining, a valve must be placed. Yet before new surgery, new MRI is done and the hematoma although reduced is still there. During the 2nd surgery (5 days after the 1st one), an intern informed us that the catheter is also replaced because when tested, it showed signs of obstruction. So we went to overdraining hypothesis to tube clogging in a span of 12 h. \nThe day after the surgery when waking up, it is clear that he is much more better. No Photophobia, no pain. The surgeon who was quite confident ahead of the 1st surgery, was quite perplexed (and might I said a bit blow away with not much explanation of what is really happening). \nThen 4 months later, the kid has no symptoms and a new control MRI is done followed by neurosurgeon appointment, with the idea to reduce the valve flow to try to weaning him off the shunt. But as the surgeon is looking the images, his face changes. Actually my son sub dural hematoma is thiker than between the 2 surgeries (2 millimeters more) while he is has no symptoms. An eye exam is done in the following week and no pressure was observed. \nSo basically, fine sub dural hematoma between 2 surgeries and awful clinical condition VS thinker sub dural hematoma and no symptoms. The surgeon is really perplexed and says that he has to \"understand\" how my kid is functioning because this is not textbook. That he relies on his symptoms and he not going to operate just for his brain to look like textbook picture. So the only thing we can do is be attentive to any degradation. A new MRI and eye check is scheduled for November (10 months post surgeries). I am not sure I understand what is being insinuated here? Or if something is? Are you saying you think there is a correlation between your child having symptoms and getting MRI images? could happen if the shunt has magnetic parts, but AFAIK, shunts are not made with magnetically sensitive parts for that reason anymore. Hello. Thanks for tacking time to reply. Apologies if I was not clear. Basically my kid is doing well post 2nd surgery with a bigger sub dural hematoma compared to the smaller one that was observed by MRI after his 1st surgery. The MRI images seems to not reflect his actual clinical state. Intuitively, it would make sense that he experience strong hydrocephalus symptoms with a bigger hematoma. But it is the other way around. This is why everyone is perplexed. Gotcha.  I am not overly familiar with hematomas re. hydrocephalus (my pathology is general aqueductal stenosis).  Could be a lot of things, hard to say, but hydrocephalus can be a tricky disease from what I have heard from some doctors.  I cannot help a whole lot here with that, but wish you luck - maybe look to other opinions if things do not change? Assuming you are in the US or a country where you can easily do that. Sounds like he was reacting badly to the hydrocephalus rather than the subdural hematoma and when that was fixed by a working shunt he was fine. You cannot see the fluid on a scan, just reactions to it and if his ventricles did not expand (which can happen) they might not have known how much pressure he had if they did not check his eyes at the time. Thanks a lot for your reply. \n\nI read once that arachnoid cystes had 1-3 % prevalence in pediatric population, hydrocephalus being one of the only complications in case of rupture. And that among hydrocephalus causes, arachnoid cystes account for less than 2 %. \nSo quite an interesting acculumation of low probabilities (well all parents think their kid is extraordinary...)\n\nWhen I talk about the neurosurgeon, it s actually a team and when unusual cases pop up they network nationally for second opinion. But as you said, the brain is quite an enigmatic organ and except hoping for the best and be vigilant (without helicoptering), no much to be done. \n\nThanks for your support and I wish you the best.", "Hydrocephalus Awareness Month graphics ", "Son had 1 Year of life to live: Gabriel's Hydrocephalus Journey review (video links included) I am a dad to a wonderful angel that was born with hydrocephalus.

We did not know what that was so we did a lot of research to ease our mind on what we would be dealing with throughout our son's life. When Gabriel was born we also found out that he had a cleft palate.\n\nBefore I begin with his story, I want to let anyone that reads this...if you have any questions regarding dealing with hydrocephalus or living with/caring for a baby or infant with hydrocephalus please feel free to ask. My wife and I will answer the best we can. We hope and pray that his story can help anyone out there. \n\nHe had his first shunt surgery at a few days old. That is when problems started as the neurosurgeon (who we found out later only had 6 weeks of training with baby and work mostly on the elderly) put in an adult sized shunt in our child. That shunt got infected and Gabriel had 3 shunt revision and 1 new shunt put in while at the first hospital where he stayed for 110 days without coming home.\n\nGabriel then moved to our local children's hospital for a few more weeks before coming home for the 1st time in his life.\n\nHe was off and on in the hospital for a total of 8 1/2 months of his life. He spent a lot of time with him family who loved him so much.\n\nGabriel was scheduled for a cleft palate surgery Jan 2016 when he was going to turn 1 year old, but Gabriel was welcomed back to heaven to be in God's arms and care before he could get his cleft palate surgery done.\n\nWe took a few videos of him the first few weeks of his life until the one day one of his nurses told us at 5 weeks that they did not expect Gabriel to last past 3 weeks. We were lucky enough to get 51 weeks with him in our lives.\n\nAfter he came home from the hospital for the last time on hospice care, we decided to put his story up on youtube for all to see who would like to. \n\nIf you would like to see his story which we are continuing to put up on youtube until the time we get to his funeral, please search youtube for either TopHatAndEars or Gabriel's Hydrocephalus Journey.

I was told my opening and closing pressure is 13. Idk what that exactly means but it sounded like they said it was normal.\n\n\nI am waiting to see the neurosurgeon. But does anyone know exactly what this means or what could be causing my hydrocephalus? I do not have any hemorrhage, tumors, or signs of strokes. \n\n\nMy only symptoms seem to be memory issues, nausea &amp; vomiting. I am exhausted all the time. I get weakness in my legs and arms at times. My feet and ankles swell randomly. My blood pressure is on the low end and tends to drop (91/54). It is just all so unfamiliar to me because I have been fairly healthy growing up other than getting strep multiple times to the point where my tonsils/adenoids removed and having scalp psoriasis, and my gallbladder removed. \n\n\nAfter multiple GI specialists, this was discovered this past July through a brain MRI. My optic nerves are okay. My gait is normal besides the weakness I get and I am a fall risk. No urinary issues besides times where I feel like I need to urinate and nothing happens. I do not experience the headaches, and my GI specialist and neurologist seem to think the fluid is resting in an area of the brain that regulates the GI tract. \n\n\nI am 27 years old and underweight. Intracranial hypertension was ruled out by the neurologist and I am waiting to see a neurosurgeon (they wanted the lumbar puncture done before they could see me). I am just confused as to how Hydrocephalus could have happened. Should I mentally prepare myself for surgery? Has anyone else been through this? I have not been through this specific scenario. I have had a VP shunt since 6 months of age and have had half a dozen revisions (or so) and I am about to turn 32. \n\nMy most recent revision was in April 2021 and while the surgery itself is not too difficult (though a full shunt placement surgery presumably would be a bit more involved), all surgery carries risk and recovery can range from \u201csmooth as butter\u201d to\u2026. less than smooth, but still not terrible (or even long-term), assuming no further complications from the surgery itself or any other extenuating circumstances.\n\nI hope they are able to get it figured out, regardless! If a shunt ends up being the answer, there will be an adjustment period, but I think overall your quality of life will improve dramatically (if this is in fact causing your symptoms).\n\nHoping the best for you! It could be a compensated hydrocephalus, a congenital ( something by birth ) one. Neurosurgeons are best suited on this topic. Hoping things remain better with you.  Possibly you may not surgery but regular followup to see if classic symptoms of hydrocephalus appears which may warrant surgical intervention. I was having gait problems prior to this coming to a head. My right foot would suddenly slip off the accelerator while driving (drove my wife nuts until we found out why). It was not until I would had a different procedure, though, that the symptoms increased. I had problems urinating, and my thinking processes were definitely dulled. When I lost my balance in the bathroom and took out the shower curtain, my wife took me into the ER.\n\nI do not really remember any of this. I am told I was quite entertaining during the exam. When I came out of my fog (they would drilled into my head and put in a drain), I was pretty confused because I was in the same ICU room I would been in two weeks prior!\n\nThey put the shunt in a few days later and I have been fine ever since. See what the neurosurgeon says and go from there.", "I never had a single headache in my life but still got diagnosed I had some problem with my ear so went for a brain MRI and CT .

(I am new to posting on reddit, please forgive any formatting errors. Hopefully my baby picture tax uploads correctly.)\n\nMy daughter just turned a year old. She had her VP shunt implanted at about 6 weeks old. In June, after months of being in and out of the ER, a neurosurgeon finally caught that her shunt had grown out of place and she had her revision. \n\nNow she is starting to show the same symptoms again: suddenly very distraught, lethargy, and vomiting. She always feels better about 30 minutes after the vomiting and then it will come back a week or so later. I feel like a crazy person, bringing in a happy and alert baby, insisting something is wrong, having her go through the whole process of an MRI and X-ray and several hours of getting poked, tired and starving, just to be told that everything on the images looks good. The same neurosurgeon who caught it last time was the one who was who saw her imaging this time, so I trust her judgement. \n\nWe have been trying to find any other explanations (stomach bug? Allergies? Got into something when we were not looking?) but no leads so far. Anyone else been through this frustrating process? Does she go to a daycare? If so, maybe it is just a bug she is caught. If you trust the neurosurgeon she has (and it seems like you do) I would just watch her.\n\nMaybe you are giving her something to eat or drink that all of a sudden is bothering her. I have a programmable shunt (I am 66 yrs old and was shunted at 28 yrs old. I  was actually born with Hydro, but there was not the testing (CT-scans) was not available back then)\n\nI can honestly tell you that certain foods bother me ALOT.....While you say she is a year old, (and you might not like this suggestion, but that is okay I understand) I would try giving her some Sprite, 7Up, Regular Pepsi or Coke. I find that soft drinks (and I drink Coke Zero) sometimes helps settle my stomach ALOT.\n\nKids pass viruses back and forth all the time and this could be what is going on, who knows?\n\nBeing parents to a young child with Hydrocephalus of course is a BIG worry, I get that. However, I would advise you to take a deep breath, listen to your child's neurosurgeon. Being overly worried will not only make you anxiety ridden, but you will transfer this to your child and believe me, your little girl can and most likely will grow up to be anything she wants to be. I went to school, got great grades, played piano, wind instruments, voice lessons, etc. I went to college and became an RN (with a Bachelors Degree) working in the ER and Labor &amp; Delivery for much of my career. I married, had 3 children ALL before being shunted. (The neurosurgeon was SHOCKED that I did not have issues at all, until I turned 28-29 yrs old. I have always had headaches, and my parents knew there was something \"wrong\" but as I have said the technology was not there to diagnose me. Our 4th child was born AFTER I was shunted. He was fine at birth, and so was I. (I delivered him vaginally.)\n\nWhat I am saying here is to try (and I know this is hard...my own mom was bananas when I was shunted the first time and I was an adult, so I know it is hard for you, (I really do!) to not be worried. However, just try some different things, she may have an \"new\" allergy to some type of food, etc. I would try giving her a little Sprite, etc. I also find that when I vomit that carbonated beverages from McDonalds/Burger King, etc. help a great deal too.\n\n***If you just want to chat....please message me any time.....I do not mind!!!*** Thank you so much for reaching out! \n\nNo, no daycare. Our oldest is immune compromised so we have been very careful about covid. \n\nI actually might grab some diet sprite or something. That is a good idea. \n\nI absolutely do worry about passing my anxiety along to her. But she is right on track developmentally, which is the biggest relief, as she has some mild brain damage.\n\nYou are a freaking champion and an inspiration. I just always \"add\" that comment (about passing anxiety to being OTT about your kids'illness)....no worries! \nYou might be surprised at just what she is able to do in life. My parents had me to MAJOR hospitals from the time I was born (I had Nystagmus, which is Rapid Eye movement, and my left side was weaker than it should have been) until I was an adult. The one thing that a MAJOR hospital told my parents was \"Do NOT baby her. It is true we do not know what is really wrong. She \"might\"(and it is a big might\") have a slight case of Cerebral Palsy.\"(but again, they WERE not sure) but you need to just treat her like any other child in the family.\"\nBelieve me if that doctor had not told my mom this, she would have been the biggest HELICOPTER mom on the planet  I swear. My parents allowed me to do everything my other two sisters (one older,one younger) did. I learned to drive, (I did have trouble learning to ride a  bike though! LOL!) I went to college, I did everything all my peers did. \n   From what you have said, you are probably doing just fine....you really are.\nAgain, if you have any questions do not hesitate to msg me.\nTake care! Stay on this. There is not a way at this moment it seems to know if it is shunt related, but does not seem to be clearly something else either. All I know is when my son was eight, he had a shunt revision, and then had symptoms that came &amp; went for a long, long time. Tried all the testing, nothing. In the end, he had surgery, because his symptoms kept keeping worse and he had low quality of life. And guess what? His shunt was almost entirely obstructed, even though it never showed evidence of on any test. Shunts are tricky. My son now has had his shunt removed and had an ETV surgery. Better for him. I had never even heard of this surgery, so thank you for that info. I am so sorry to hear your son went through that for so long. The doctors keep telling us that because her ventricles are not enlarged, there is no way the shunt is malfunctioning. It makes me wonder if it is clogging only periodically? I feel like there is so much information I am assuming but also is not being volunteered by the neurosurgeons. It could be intermittently failing. We have had this happen several times where my son will show symptoms, then be fine an hour later. Eventually it got to the point where it was obvious and fully blocked. It is hard to get intermittent failures diagnosed. I would suggest keeping notes of when these episodes happen, what the symptoms are, and how long they happen. Then after a week or so call your neurosurgeon and show them the notes! We have not had any revisions since the initial placement of our shunt (8 weeks) for our 14 month old, so take this with a grain of salt. We just try our best to stick to a schedule to help with tracking lethargy. We do \"wake windows\", where her naps are not the same time everyday, but it is always awake 2 hours, nap, awake 2.5 hours, nap, awake until she gets around 12 hours of total sleep. It helps us see if there are any sleeping issues even if she has one short/bad nap. She is consistently getting 12 hours of total sleep so I am hoping that this takes one variable out of the equation. We worry less now that we are on a good schedule. We have been to the ER quite a few times for vomiting. It is usually just false alarms. My daughter had scans one time that looked good despite being symptomatic. We got sent home but a week later we were back and she needed a revision. Our neurosurgeon told us that sometimes you just cannot see a blockage. It is really tough when they are little, but it gets easier when get older and are generally more active and expressive. It is all pretty frustrating. I am about to go to the pediatrician because my kid random vomits with seemingly no explanation, which is a pretty crummy thing to do as a person with hydrocephalus. This sounds like what has been happening with our one year old. It comes out of nowhere and then disappears again after an hour or so. I am be taking your suggestion and keeping notes, because I feel like they do not take me seriously when I go in after every episode. The whole experience is so stressful. She is clearly in distress and it is just like last time when we were in and out of the ER for months before they made the call to do a revision. Get her to her neurological/surgeon ASAP... Be persistent.. She is having another shunt malfunction.. One lesson I have learned is that when a pediatrician knows your infant has hydrocephalus they are going to recommend the ER for any symptoms even half resembling hydrocephalus. The first 2 years are really tough. It sucks spending lots of time in a Children\u2019s hospital, but it is the right call. Turn off the part of your brain that cares what other people may think. You are doing your job to keep that kid healthy. I cannot recall the statistic, but kids with hydrocephalus actually do make up a pretty staggering number of ER visits so you are not actually being outlandish. It is just what we do. For us it has gotten easier. We still go more often than other people and have more check ups than most families, but identifying symptoms of an upset stomach and a shunt issue are getting easier to distinguish. We can predict a vomit well enough to get a toddler to the toilet in time for what it is worth. You will start to recognize a lot more. Just take note of symptoms and mannerisms that your kid does going forward and in the past. We went through some frustrating years and I swear there is a thing as a shunt clogging only periodically, despite our then neurosurgeon saying that was not a thing. What I did discover by reading FB posts in Hydro groups by other moms, was there were lots of symptoms that came up &amp; it was difficult to know what to attribute them to. We went to several different Nsurgeons and they each had their own philosophies. I was surprised at how different their opinions were on things. Incidentally, my son is now 16-this whole business happened to him years 8-10, and he lives a completely normal life now &amp; has not had a surgery since. We believe it is at least a partial malfunction, too. The ER we go to is at the children's hospital that all her specialists are at, so she is been seen by several neurosurgeons. At this point it is just a matter of proving to them that it is the shunt. We are getting pretty good at knowing the signs, too. It is hard trusting your instinct when you are so new at this and medical professionals make you question your judgment. Ugh. It is good to know that it gets easier. Congrats to your son! I love you hear that he is doing well. I hope we will be there one day.\n\nI feel like it HAS to be a periodic or partial malfunction. Because the MRIs show her ventricles are actually reduced in size compared to last time, but the symptoms are exactly the same. Can a clogged shunt correct itself and drain within a few hours? That seems to be the general time frame of her symptoms and then she is back to normal for a while. I am an adult but have had two shunt revisions. The last one that I had was like this. All imaging looked fine and a spinal tap was also within range, but an eye doctor found papilladema when taking pictures of the back of my eye, indicating that my shunt was not working properly. I am so glad you mentioned that. I actually just scheduled her appointment with an opthalmologist in a few months. No doctor ever told me it was something to look out for or have her tested. I had to hear from other patients with hydrocephalus. There are also people that have hydrocephalus issues but are not indicated on a single CT, but over time they reveal themselves when ventricles are compared from multiple CTs. \n\nIt is very frustrating, but extremely rewarding when you locate the root of the issue. I hope everything works out. Thank you. I hope so, too. She had another vomiting episode just today and I am so tired for her.", "Teddy Shunt Valve I was contacted by the parent of a child with hydrocephalus and asked to make a shunt valve for his Teddy bear to help him understand and normalise the condition.\n\nThis kind of exploded on Facebook but as not everyone uses Facebook I decided to share it here. \n\nI sent it to a lab and had it safety tested as a toy, and refined the design until it was safe. I then went on to make a website about it and thought I would share a link here. \n\nSo what do you think? \n\n( I was looking at your store on Etsy only last week! I probably saw it on the Facebook group. I love it so much and I will probably order one for when my son is old enough to help explain it to him.\nWhat made you decide to make these? Is there someone in your life with hydrocephalus or do you have it yourself (if that is not too personal a question)? Ignore the latter part of my comment - I missed the part about the parent asking you to make one \ud83e\udd2d You can also get them from  They call it the \u201cboozle bear\u201d. The rest of their contact information I would on their website I think you have answered the question already. I am really glad you like it, and it is had amazing feedback from the community.

I am looking into buying a home in a city which is about an hour drive from work. I dont mind the drive, but there is a 800' change in elevation.\n\nOf the three times I have driven to the new town twice I have felt a bit woozy. However I have taken trips to the coast before and felt fine, which is a 3.7k difference in elevation.\n\nHave any of you experienced something similar?", "Has anyone had a lumbar puncture done to test for increased ICP? Symptoms for years, but no change in Ventricle size. So my neurosurgeon's next step is a lumbar puncture. NPH or normal pressure hydrocephalus is oftentimes diagnosed with a lumbar puncture. The CT scans all look normal except when a lumbar puncture is done and the increases ICP can show then. It is most common in the older population and mistaken for dementia due to the symptoms that are shown by the person with NPH. We could not figure out what was going on before my most recent revision (April 2021). Eventually resorted to a lumbar puncture. (Noticed another comment mentioning it is more typical in older patients - I was 31 when this happened.)\n\nIt also did not tell us anything. After they did it, I was okay, and then have no memories for approximately the following 2 days until they did the revision surgery. \n\nI think my case was exceptional because the other typical diagnostic tests kept coming back negative, but ultimately, if you are having symptoms, a lumbar puncture is far less inconvenient/painful than dealing with the impact of a malfunctioning shunt. The worst part of it is honestly just that you have to wait for a while after the procedure to ensure you are stable. Otherwise, it is not too bad. \n\nI hope you are able to get it figured out! I am 35, been showing symptoms for 12 years. There is no way it could have caused the malfunction, right? That is what I am nervous about. The pain for a short amount of time is no biggie. It definitely did not cause my shunt malfunction. I can say that with as much certainty + confidence as anyone who is not a doctor. I was having serious issues with the shunt for weeks leading up to that moment.", "Subreddit improvments! Need your help! Hello all,\n\nThanks to u/UnEntitled I recently became a moderator of this subreddit. Having Hydrocephalus myself, I am passionate about helping those with Hydrocephalus and educating others on the complications and affects it can have on the patient and family. I realize this subreddit is small, but I intend on sprucing it up a bit and making it a more inviting place for all to come and learn. I have begun adding helpful links on the side bar to the right that direct you to obvious resources dealing with Hydrocephalus, **but I was wondering what other things needed to be added or done to the subreddit to make it a more helpful place to visit for everyone?** \n\nThanks,\n\n-Charrito5", "Shunt problem? To start I am a 14 year old boy with mylomenigocele (excuse my spelling) spina bifida the last time I had a shunt malfunction was February of 2006 (I was born august of 2005) anyway last July I started to notice a really annoying and painful pain a little bit above and on the bump on my head as well behind my ear. My parents took me to the doctor and they said it was anxiety. Now March 2020 the pain has gotten better but I still have pain a little bit above the bump when ever I laugh hard and I still have the pain behind my ear. Can this be a shunt problem? That is a good question! Do you have a neurosurgeon? A regular doctor is not as knowledgeable about shunts as a neurosurgeon would be. I do believe they can cause some people pain, though they should not. The good news is since it is been going on do long it probably is not a serious emergency surgery type thing!!! But I would definitely do this: ask your regular doctor for a referral to a neurosurgeon. They will write the referral and then you wait for your insurance to approve it (few days or so). Then make an appt to see the neurosurgeon. They can help you figure it out best. Hugs! Ok thanks! Not really on the topic of the post but if you ever want to talk about Hydrocephalus or stuff like it with somebody your age (I am a 14 year old boy too) feel free to DM me. Cool", "Not sure if memes are allowed here but I thought you all would relate to this one!  Every time your baby with hydrocephalus throws up. Every time it rains outside Yup me absolutely. Hypochondriac with really bad anxiety Pretty far from being a hypochondriac but this is totally me. Literally me \ud83d\ude2d \"I walked by a magnetic door and now I have a minor headache - time to start filing that life insurance and saying goodbye to all of my loved ones\"", "Surgical Trauma Does anyone else experience a very specific type of depression after surgery? I have noticed that once the pain wears off, I tend to feel fine but randomly become incredibly sad without thought associated with it. I just got my wisdom teeth out a few days ago and it gave me the same effects. \n\nI am thinking it might be a form of PTSD since it is technically a biological trauma. Or it might just be a chemical thing since the drugs effect brain chemicals. Yeah I experienced this, but i think its a normal thing that can happen after any kind of surgery? I dont know actually, never before did research on it. Hope you are doing ok. All of it.  \n\nI have spent the better part of a decade trying to understand why I am the way I am..and PTSD from repeated surgeries is the cause.  Now, I am not a broken down-and-out individuals..I just have a completely different outlook on life because I have been through a couple comas and have had my brain worked on several times.  Spent the better part of 20 years wondering if I would even wake up the next day.\n\nHere is the homework portion: dedicate your time to figure out this issue for yourself. You can get through it, it is real, your surgical trauma did happen.   Talk to people here and reading stories has helped tremendously.  \n\nI am here for ya if you need a person to chat with. Surgery is a big deal. You are under a lot of stress, then put under strong medications, all on top of your body having been under a lot of physical stress and now it has to heal. Your body always wants to get to homeostasis and its various sensory capabilities can all tell that multiple things are not normal pre-op, in surgery and post-op. That is a lot for your body to go through while maintaining a smile. I do not think keys post traumatic stress syndrome as much as your expectations for yourself being a bit high. It is ok to be totally wiped out. Right before any surgery I have panic attacks even with the medicine they use to cal patients, but I figured out the cause. When I am put to sleep I can feel my body breathe out and not breathe back in before I fall asleep. So, that half a second of fear causes these huge panic attacks. Now since I have found the culprit, it is a little easier, so maybe the easiest way to help would be to find your root. Surgery can be a fairly isolating experience, because you are stuck in recovery and cannot do a lot of the things you would normally do, so it is normal. I think it is a natural response to being in a vulnerable position, so I do not think the drugs play a big role (they might, but unless it is a well documented side effect for that particular drug, I think it is unlikely). &gt;Yeah I experienced this\n\nSame here and I personally found that sleeping more and eating comfort foods available at the hospital can help combat this depression. Yeah definitely agree! You really hit the nail on the head here. That really resonated with me. Thank you. That really helped. It is not being changed it is just my body doing what bodies do", "Changes to menstrual cycle: anyone else experienced this? I am a 24F living in London who is generally healthy. Prior to my Hydrocephalus diagnosis, I had not even had surgery or been in hospital before. Never even broken a bone. \n\nThe last period I had was on the 9th of August. I was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus on the 18th August after having had symptoms for 8/9 months. I had an ETV on the 20th of August was sent home 2 days later. Unfortunately my ETV was unsuccessful and I ended up back in hospital with CSF leaking from my wound. \n\nI had a shunt fitted on the 3rd of September but caught a CSF infection so had the shunt removed and wasfitted with an EVD. I then went on a 24 day course of antibiotics to clear the infection. During those 24 days, I had to have the EVD changed twice because they malfunctioned/started leaking (each change required an hour long surgery under general anaesthetic.) \n\nI had my final surgery to put the shunt back in on 25th of September and everything has been going well since then. The only thing is I have not had a period since before my first surgery. Prior to all of these surgeries, my periods ran like clockwork. My Neurosurgery team did say that I would experience some hormonal changes and that they would sort themselves out. I spoke to my GP who pretty much said the thing. I know 6 surgeries in the space of a month and a few weeks was a lot for my body to go through but 4 months with no period is a little alarming. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Did surgery mess with your cycle too? If yes, how long did it take for everything to go back to normal? I would say it is probably stress. Sometimes your body can react in that way. Once your body and mind feel calmer, it should go back to normal.\n\n(The weird thing is not having a period can make us stress which puts off our period for longer.) This has happened to me. Your body just needs time and will menstruate again. Believe me. I have had 11 brain surgeries and currently have 3 shunts. Wow- 3 shunts at the same time?! That is the first I have heard of that, you warrior!! Thanks and you probably have not heard of this because it is really uncommon If you do not mind me asking, what is the reason you have 3 shunts in? My brain just decided to not flow properly and needed help I had seven surgeries within 5 months when I was 13. The last three surgeries of that bunch were due to an infection that led me to being on IV antibiotics for a couple of weeks. I skipped a cycle after all that. I went the summer with no period at all and did not get my period for 11 weeks.", "Random sharp pains I am about 4 years post op VP shunt install. I have been getting random sharp pains near my shunt itself. They remind me of sharp electric shocks. \n\nI have zero symptoms of shunt failure. No fever. The last time I was seen this year I had my settings changed for over draining and slit ventricular. \n\nI believe it is time for another MRI. Just curious if anyone else has experienced these pains. This is a first for me and I can usual diagnosis myself. May be the shunt, for sure, but one possibility that came to mind: any change in meds recently? \n\n\u201cBrain zaps\u201d are a thing that can happen after moving off of SSRIs (and some other meds). Feels like electric shocks, literally in your brain. My personal experience of them is not a localized pain, more generalized usually, but figured I would mention the possibility. No med change. At all. For me personally, sharp pains around the shunt itself has been scar tissue related Yes!! I do not know that I would say my sudden pains felt like electric shock but more like someone took a pair of pliers and grabbed a chunk of my brain and just squeezed it super hard. It used to happen alot, not so much lately.. I get these pains as well but they do not feel like electric shocks, more like someone stabbing me with a large needle.", "How long do ETVs usually last? I am just curious. I have an etv (4.5 years with one). I have heard things ranging from they will never fail to they fail within months post op. How likely are they to fail and what would you guys say the average life of an etv is? They have basically the same failure rate as a shunt.  I have one too but only for the past two months\n\nFrom what I heard, most failure happen in the first three months after surgery and the longer you go without issues. The lower the chances of you running into problems\n\n\n\n&gt;\tETV is an effective and safe alternative to shunt implantation for the treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus. The complication rate is moderate, and mortality rate is minimal. Even in a mixed population, excellent short-term and long-term results were achieved with thorough patient selection and sophisticated surgery. In most cases of ETV failure, the failure occurred early, within the first 3 months. Age and etiology are significant factors and predictors of surgical success. In contrast, preoperative shunt dependence had no significant impact. The results of this study with a large, mixed population and follow-up of several years confirm ETV as the procedure of choice for obstructive hydrocephalus.", "Bending over Does anyone else experience pain and a weird feeling if they have been bent over to long? \nI was at work today, lifting boxes, so I was bent over quite a bit. After that my shunt felt a little strange, now I have a bit of pain. I am sure it will be gone by tomorrow, just wondering if anyone else experiences this?", "Have any of you guys ever done any chiropractic adjustments? I see all these videos of people getting their neck and back adjusted. Having chronic back pain and headaches, I am curious if I can have that done. I have a vp shunt and my tubing is on my left side. Have you guys ever done this? Definitely check with your surgeon. Mine advised against getting any neck/shoulder massages so I imagine he would have also advised against a chiropractic adjustment. It is always worth double checking :) Whenever I ask about any precautions or anything I should avoid, they always say tell me that i could do everything as I normally would. But still, I would check with your surgeon about this. I have actually seen people get adjustments, and it does look (and sound) brutal. I personally would not do chiropractic. I have seen a physiotherapist who has experience of patients with shunts, after I asked my neurosurgeon if they had any recommendations. I do not know about your situation but in the UK, physiotherapy is evidence based and regulated, chiropractic is...not so much. We have been taking our vp shunted son for the past 5 years. The Neurosurgeon advised against anything around the upper body, and neck, so the chiropractor only focuses from the mid back down through the hips. He has hemipalega on one side, which causes his hips to be out of alignment. Getting adjusted regularly has helped with his discomfort. I have been going to a chiropractor for about four years for various reasons and I get all of the adjustments done, including the neck. The chiropractor is aware of the shunt tubing on the right side of my neck, and it has never caused a problem. I will say that I only trust two people in this world to do those adjustments on me, so it would be important to find someone you can trust. Before surgery,but not anymore! Neurosurgeon says it is a big no-no! However,she highly suggest deep tissue massages. I do not know if it is true for you all,but this comes from a teenage girl with 3 shunts. It is the same in the US. Doctors and physical therapists generally hold a pretty negative opinion on chiropractors. If I were the op I would get a massage, stretch, start or continue a comprehensive exercise regimen and potentially get some pt if needed.", "Do i have it or not? Hey everyone, \n\nUp until yesterday I had never even heard the word hydrocephalus. \n\nI went to the er after a boxing match because of headaches after getting hit to the head a little too much. \n\nDoctor had me get a CT scan and after a while he came back asking questions about if I ever had minigitis (nope) if I can walk properly and stuff like that. I ve never had any symptom like. I ve rarely even have headaches. \n\nBut the doc said that in the CT scan assymetry in ventricles or something like that. I am still waiting to get the results from my CT scan so I can bring it to another doctor cause that guy just told me that and left, no guidance whatsoever. \n\nAnyway I am kind of freaking out after reading all about hydrocephalus and wanted your opinion on the matter.. I am 32 by the way. Could I really have all these years without symptoms at all.. And if yes will I continue to be symptom free? \n\nThanks in advance Hydrocephalus can develop at a late age, I have had it since birth, and I am not a doctor, so I could be totally wrong. But I am pretty sure any blockage in any part of the brain would cause hydro. Which means if you were to say, get hit in the head and dislodge(/cause something to inflame) something that is been dormant until then, it could block up a ventricle and cause hydro to develop. I repeat, I am not a doctor, just a 20 y/o with hydro and a vp shunt up at 4:45am because work. All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!\n\n    20 +\n    4 +\n    45 +\n    = 69.0 But honestly, seeing as how you were not immediately rushed into surgery, I would not be too concerned if I were you. You may still have it, but if it was severely life threatening at this point they would have done something at the time. He is probably just worried something could potentially develop into a blockage. I hope all of this helps you Good bot, but can ya choose your timing a little better next time I think that is an important point, and I hope it gives OP some comfort.\n\nI was diagnosed later on in life (I was 22), although I had suffered from, and received treatment for, 'migraines' and fainting episodes in my teens.\n\nTo give an idea of how quickly things escalate: I banged my head which led to a CT scan after feeling quite unwell for a couple of days, the CT scan found the hydrocephalus and I was moved to a neuro centre that night. I had an MRI the next day, and was operated on (ETV) the day after that.  Hey I dm\u2019d you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nHope it helps! That is what I was thinking. If it was that serious would not they at least tell me to search it further? The neurosurgeon came, he said we found this, asked me a couple questions and said just keep on checking it  once a year I do not know much about the condition but I guess continuing martial arts is out of the question. If I do have it I mean. Also can it remain asymptomatic forever? Or it is a matter of time before it produces symptoms? Oh I didnt get it can you DM me again? Hey guys another question. Just spoke with my gf and turns out 2 years ago I did a neck and head MRI and nothing came up.. Could it be misdiagnosis since whatever new saw he insisted it was there from birth? Like I said, I have had hydro since birth, and I did martial arts as a kid and my ns did not have a problem with it (assuming my parents told him). But if my parents thought there would be am issue, I would not have been allowed to do it. It probably depends on what type of martial arts it is. It could potentially remain dormant for forever and never develop into an issue, that is very much possible. Just remember, if you start getting migraines that feel like a gun shot to the head, dizziness, or setting sun (your eyes pretty much get forced to look downwards due to increased intracranial pressure), call your doctor immediately. There are other signs/symptoms, but I cannot remember them rn. Sure! Should be in your messages now Will do, thanks. Still hope it is misdiagnosis or something like that. Plus head and neck MRI 2 years ago did not show anything and from what I read its unlikely it would go unoticed even if the problem was the neck and not the brain back then My NS is happy for me to continue with sports; I still hike, cycle, and play ice hockey for example (no checking, but still the risk of falling over!). Obviously I would recommend discussing this with your consultant and following their advice. \n\nI am in my 30s now and have had the ETV in for over 10 years. I do suffer with fatigue and that can amplify some other issues like memory and speech, but these are relatively minor. \n\nI would like to think that my diagnosis and treatment has allowed me to live a fulfilled life so far, and I hope that you will get your answers and be able to do the same! Hydrocephalus can be caused by head trauma so you may not have had it for years, it may have been caused by boxing. We cannot tell you if you have it or not, the only thing you can really do is follow through on the tests and see what the doctors say. It can develop quickly, however, i believe you would be experiencing symptoms. Im no doctor but I do have hydro since birth. The only reason I found out was because I was in a car crash and I had a headache for 4 days straight. Did a ct same as you, i ended up getting an MRI before an official diagnosis. I expierenced quite a few hydro symptoms growing up but obviously would not have connected the dots. But quite frequently, my knees do buckle, which is a symptom and as I have gotten older I do expierence intense migraine but I am not sure that is hydro related. Woah that is wild, could be a misdiagnosis, but when you talk to your dr again, I would ask if they would want to do another MRI. Still without a shunt? Well the reason I went to the hospital was that after a sparring session on which I took some good punches (but I was still blocking them, so not direct hits) I ve had some naussea for a day or 2 after. Gf was worried and asked me to go to the er. I do not even have the results from the CT scan. \n\nA neurosurgeon came to me while I was waiting and asked me a couple questions and then he said they found an assymetry of ventricles or something like that. \n\nAfter that he said you are ok and left.. I asked the initial doc who saw me what the other doc was talking about and if he could write it down so I can check it with my own doc until I get the results. \n\nAnd he wrote hydrocephalus and something else. I asked about damage from the blows (the initial reason I got there) and he said no. No bleeding or anything. \n\nSo something does not add up to all this. I just read that assymetry in the ventricles could be completely benign. And if it was something as serious as hydrocephalus even an assymptomatic I think they should at least check me further. \n\nRight now it is a waiting game. I am already kind of hypochondriac so a doctor coming to me all worried and asking questions and then me at home googling hydrocephalus.. Well you can imagine the freak out Well, my dr had suggested but i was very young like 12 at the time and he didnt want to put me through the surgery if it wasnt absolutely needed. I think I might try to get another appt with my original neuro to inquire Update\n\nHello again, \n\nJust wanted to let you know what happened. \n\nI finally got the results from the CT scan. \n\nThe CT scan showed a minor dilation of the ventricles but on the paper of the hospital diagnosis it said clinical check to rule out normal pressure hydrocephalus. \n\nAnyway I went to another neurosurgeon today and he said that its 99.9% just my anatomy and nothing to worry about. \n\nI asked if I should check it further, maybe with an MRI and he said that it was not necessary. \n\nThanks a lot for all your replies and support. If you are in the US, have you looked at the website for the Hydrocephalus Association? ( They are a wealth of information. Remember everyone is experiences are different and like most illnesses / conditions people are more likely to post the negative online and not focus on the positive aspects of their lives.", "Does anyone else get dizzy/headaches when they stand up? I am pretty sure  that I do not have anemia, as I eat quite healthily, but I get dizzy or a headache starts when I stand up. I was wondering if other people with hydrocephalus have the same thing. Absolutely! Its actually kind of normal for non Hydo people to get dizzy when they stand up after sitting for an extend period of time.  I get dizzy if I get up too fast or turn turn around too fast. Motion rides do a number on me at amusement parks. Sometimes I get dizzy just sitting still. I was diagnosed at age 20 with NPH and shunted. I am about to be 48. Same shunt. I still get headaches. Not as bad as before my shunt. Something I do not think they tell Hydrocephalus/ shunt patients ahead of time is a shunt is not a cure, it is not magic. You will still have alot of the same issues as not having a shunt but you will be alive. I am thankful for everyday I have had after I was shunted. I am not perfect but with my shunt I have gotten to see my sons grow up and I have had alot of experiences I would have missed out on without it. It is pretty normal. If it is sudden and drastic and new then go see your specialist. Sometimes it could also be the crystals in your ears. There are some helpful YouTube videos about how to reset the crystals do they bother you less. Yep. It is normal. No. That is not normal.

There is basically no reason at all to undergo MRI's/CT's without a reason.\n\nI have DAILY migraine headaches, yet the Dr. knows about the headaches (I have had them for years, prior to being shunted and of course AFTERWARDS...so the doctor told me that unless the HEADACHE changes etc. it is best to just \"deal\" with it, and that is what I do. If I see a doctor who is not familiar with me, they tend to not believe that I can function with a \"8\" (on a scale of 1-10) headache but I have dealt with these types of headaches for SO LONG.....it is became a way of life for me and I have just learned to adjust my life around it.\n\ncheck with your N/S but for the most part the only reason you should have an MRI is if your surgeon thinks there is a reason for  it, you should not have them as a routine procedure. It is been 10 yrs since I have had an MRI. It is best to stay away from all the scans if possible. I do every year or 2. I am having a bad year so I am at every week right now Last brain surgery was 2011. Last hydro related surgery (abdominal) was 2014. I am at an every other year visit schedule. I have already been told I will be having a baseline MRI before my next appointment in 2021. Thanks for the info. Sorry that you are having a bad spell right now. It is fair to say, that anyone who has experienced hydro can understand the pain and discomfort that comes along with it. \n\nDeep breathing helped take my mind of the pain sometimes, not always but I found it worked for me occasionally.  \n\nHopefully your condition and comfort level improves soon. Thank you for the info.  What do you mean by baseline MRI? Is it before a scheduled surgery? Thank you \u263a\ufe0f A baseline MRI or a baseline CT is when you have not had any scans is several years. As I said in the previous comment I do not have CT or MRI's very often (and I am seen by the Chief Neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan) and the last CT I had was 2 months ago, and the last one prior to that was a few years  ago.\n\nSo, when you have not had scans in several years they do a Baseline scan to compare to the older scans you have had. I see. Thanks for the clarification.", "What causes hydro headaches to go away? From maybe ages 3-11ish my hydro headaches were really severe and often but kind of once I hit 11 they pretty much completely disappeared or at least no where near to that degree.\nI am so glad \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nDoes anyone know what the cause could be? Your brain has probably adjusted to this \"new norm\".", "Bachelorette star makes appearance at Hydrocephalus walk ", "Hydrocephalus treated with ETV Hey guys, I am so glad I found this sub! I have hydrocephalus due to a brain tumour that I have been battling for 8 years and counting now. It is nice to find other people who can understand some of what I am going through.\n\nI had an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). I do not really have any hydro symptoms anymore nor did I have to have another hydro related surgery. However I did have a small procedure about a year after the surgery to drain some fluid. I literally had a tube coming out of my skull!\n\nAnybody else here who had an ETV? What was your experience like? And why is not this procedure done more often? My daughter has hydro. She is 5 and got her last revision when she was 3. They did not do ETV, but her new neurosurgeon has talked about it along with her next revision. Is it supposed to be a more or less permanent fix? I have read a little about it, but not enough to understand fully. ETV is definitely a better/more sophisticated option imo. If it can be done for your daughter I think you should do it, it is a lot easier to live with than a shunt. Hope ageism doing well! I had two EVT due to tumors. I unfortunately the hole closed again 2 months after the first one and then I had a shunt placed. It is been going since 2001 *crosses fingers* Hey I am sorry to hear that :( I almost had to get a shunt once when my neurosurgeon was out of the country and I had to see a different doctor who was quite dumb. How come they did not attempt to reopen your hole? We will definitely look more into it. Thank you for replying! Would they remove the shunt or is the ETV in conjunction with it? The ETV would be instead of the shunt :) yeah definitely talk with the neurosurgeon! I actually had an ETV done in 2010, but the surgery did not go well, so a shunt was later put into place. I understand that it is a more effective fix than a shunt, but I was unaware of them having to go back in and drain fluid, do you know what the cause of that was?  I am not really sure why there was fluid buildup. The surgeon said my ETV was not even closed up but I was having some pressure so she removed some of the fluid. It has not happened since. My ventricles are bigger than normal but I do not have any issues with fluid buildup anymore. Well, that is great to hear. I see far too many hydrocephalus horror stories. Best wishes, hydro buddy! Thank you! Best wishes to you as well friend :) It is not always instead of the shunt. My friends daughter has both a shunt and ETV as the ETV has closed more than once. It is really a case by case basis. It is okay it is what it is. Basically it was just pointless to try another ETC, as they were closing up. Shunt was a more permanent stable option. No issues yet. Going on 17ish years :) Well I am glad it all worked out for you!:) Keep Knocking on wood. I have not had insurance in years. Just got my first real job with insurance. Have my first MRI in years tomorrow and the next day. Hoping it goes well. Interesting! I did not know that. Well I hope your MRI comes back good. I am having an MRI next week as well. Hi I had an ETV 6 months ago on the 16th Dec (Its actually a public holiday in my country). Anyway headaches started one afternoon at work, 18 hours later I had the surgery. It was a success and havent had any pain since but one fallout of the operation was memory loss caused by bruising. \nSo its 6 months later and i havent had a headache since but really struggling at work coping with memory lapses Hey it is good your ETV is working! I am sorry to hear about the memory loss though, is there anything that can be done about it? Will the bruising heal by itself? Its healed alrdy but the memory is an ongoing problem that only therapy can help with  Oh I see. Well I do hope the therapy will help you, that sounds very tough. Best wishes to you! Unfortunately my lesions have grown. I havent talked to the doctor yet so I am trying not to freak out. \n\nDid you get yours back? Oh that is terrible, I am sorry to hear that :( i hope it is not too serious.\n\nmy MRI is on Friday and I am seeing the doctor the same day so I will know then. Thx alot, its kind words like these that make things better. Take care  My wife was diagnosed with hydrocephalus 2 years ago(obstructive, non communicating). She has had 2 shunt revisions, first was a strata this one is a Certas. Her first valve they could not get her pressures right and her ventricles would blow up then they's adjust and they would collapse. After her second revision, she suffered from a rarish condition caused by the inflation/deflation that caused her to be in the hospital for 16 weeks, several in a coma; she now suffers with parkinsonisms that are treated with sinamet. She is back to work, but she has short term memory issues as well. Her current team of neurology/neurosurgeons want to do an EVT on her; but she now has slit ventricles which is another whole set of complications that are delaying the procedure. Her life right now is pretty miserable and I do not know what to do to help her except keep trying to get her seen and letting her docs know how things are failing. Hey, I am so sorry to hear about your wife. That sounds terrible. It seems like you are doing what you can though, so I hope that she will get better soon. Hydrocephalus can be such a terrible and debilitating condition. Thoughts with both of you.", "Hypochondriac I had 2 surgeries back in 2011 one because my tubing was all messed up so they had to add more or whatever and then ANOTHER one because my stomach was leaking fluid from surgery so 8ish years I have been obsessing as to whether or not I am malfunctioning again like I went through a phase were every day for a while thought I was leaking when it was not I am always thinking subconsciously or not that something is wrong and the sucky part is I am a crying wolf now and so therefore my mother does not really believe me when I complain so it just makes me more worried because of all the what if\u2019s it is gotten to the point where I have been to the hospital every month since January (for mental heath reasons as well) and I am just so done feeling like this like what happens if I do end up actually getting sick and no one believes me \ud83d\ude25 Your mom is likely thinking about it too and just trying to stay calm when she really wants to freak out. That is what I do every time my daughter throws up or seems like she is staring off into the distance because she cannot focus. You are getting to the hospital so people do care. Focus and remember what all of your symptoms were when you had a malfunction. I go through them anytime I suspect something and monitor how they progress. In my experience malfunctions present symptoms for a couple days before it becomes very apparent that a revision is needed. Try and remain as calm as possible. Does panicking help solve a health issue? Of course not. It makes everything more challenging to diagnose, process, manage, treat, cope with, and generally makes us feel worse. Essebtially I am advising you to put a system in place. Take a deep breath, Make a check list of symptoms to go through, remember to breath, know what your time frame is like, decide your plan of action, utilize a packing list or have a go bag, breath, and continue to talk with people here and/or a therapist. \n\nI was literally in the panic stage 2 days ago. Life is tough sometimes, but you have already made it through two surgeries so you know you are tough. Do not forget to ride the wave and enjoy when times are good!  I do not live with my mother I live by myself also so that makes it harder like I (like 1,000,000 years ago) have had seizures and subconsciously I worry that I am going to have another (because I do not really know the signs  of one)  like  I know my mom cares and everything but she (most of the time) blows it off as nothing and I know she is right when she says \u201cI am fine\u201d but regardless it sucks because I always feel like shit and also I have been having really bad dizzy spells and headaches also throwing up today cannot keep anything down like it could be the weather but idk though I have been throwing up a lot this week  I am sorry to say that I do not think the concern ever goes away. The only way I have been able to not drive myself to distraction is that I made a conscious decision to just acknowledge that there could be an issue but try to lead as much of a normal life as possible. \n\nI am coming up to 29 years on the last shunt, and I still remember the problems wth CSF leaking out my stomach, neck and head and multiple surgeries. I feel like I have a time bomb ticking inside me. \n\nIt is something that is on my mind daily - every time I have a headache or a neck ache I take some paracetamol, have a lie down and try to get on with it. \n\nAfter suffering neck and head pain up the shunt tract in 2016 I had an MRI only to see that the catheter was still in place and the tube looked 'ok'.  Turns out the cause was a muscle strain from me running around the house with a 2 year old on my shoulders \ud83e\udd23 hopefully your symptoms will be non shunt related too!\n\nIf you need to talk, the sub is empty most of the time, but I am sure most would respond to a pm.\n", "Can someone with hydrocephalus walk again? My father had a stomach rupture surgery 6 months ago. After the surgery he gradually became unable to control his bladder, he stopped eating. He was having a hard time walking because of over 30 stitches on his stomach so we did not know him not being able to walk was because of something else. After the surgery he had a hard time eating so he suddenly lost a lot of weight (30 kilos in 1,5 months). Non of the doctors or his surgeon suspected anything on his brain they assumed it was because of the surgery and he was having a hard time recovering. suddenly he stopped walking completely, he then quickly lost the ability to move his body. We went to a neurologist and he is suspecting hydrocephalus. It will take a few days, new mr\u2019s and other doctors opinions to diagnose him with hydrocephalus so we cannot talk to the doctor about the questions I am about to ask, yet. \n\nHas anyone experienced or witnessed a patient being able to walk again after being at this far stage of this illness, with treatments, surgery and physical therapy? Does the memory loss recover? \n\nI just want my father to recover from this horrible condition of his\u2026 \n\nHe is 72, thanks to everyone in advance\u2026 Every case is unique to a person. My mom was about the same age when she had surgery and could not bend knees and needed assistance to the bathroom and could not make it.  she could move the rest of her body but things were slow and awkward so she just sat. Very severe memory loss, Angry all the time and confused. She sounded more mobile than your dad and her symptoms appeared gradually over many years with gradual loss of these functions which we thought was poor aging. After her shunt she regained mobility and memories and after just a few months was dancing and enjoying life; it was a miracle a night and day recovery. Her health otherwise was good though. The walk has a shuffle to it (look at videos on how feet can not get up off ground o youtube) and your mobility description is nothing like what happened to her. Your dad may or may not have hydrocephalus but in either case I hope for the same recovery my mother had. Thank you so much for sharing your experience. My dad slowly started lifting one of his arms and can kind of twitch his legs after some physical therapy. But he is still bed bound. This gives me hope\u2026 We will know for sure about his diagnosis in 3 days. What did you find out? Unfortunately my father passed away I am so sorry, I feel your pain.

For the humans, do you get headaches with the shunt implant?  Yes, you do still get headaches, but if you throw up with a headache, you know something is wrong. That is the way I distinguish it at least. With our pup having the shunt, we never really know if she is is pain. \nSevere pain we can obviously tell, but discomfort, we are not sure. \n\nDo you still feel pressure in your head? I have had Hydrocephalus since birth. I received my first shunt at a year old and let me tell you, I get the worst headaches at times. Most of it has to do with the weather changing. It varies a lot from person to person, like ... A lot. Some people have headaches so strong they have to call in sick at work and confine in a dark room the whole day, while others have barely any symptoms. I guess if your dog was having a lot of issues you would notice :) I only really feel a pressure if I have a headache, but it might be different for others. She naps in the afternoon under our bed. \nProbably because it is the darkest place in the house. \nWe keep the curtains closed in the bedroom so it is extra dark. Do you notice any behavior difference when air pressure changes? For instance, when the weather changed suddenly from sunny to rainy. That is one of the most common causes of headaches from what I know. Unfortunately we live in Scotland. \n\nThe chance of it going from rainy to sunny is unlikely. \n\nIt goes from rainy to marginally less rainy. Haha at least you will never get lack of castles :) We are filled with castles. \nMy girlfriends mum came over from Hungary to visit. \nOn our way to see one of the, many, castles, we went by a big house that kind of looks like a castle. \n\nHer mum was impressed. \n\nWe had to explain that that was just some dudes house and not an actual castle. I know, I have been there! Loved it despite of the winter cold! What a lovely girl. I would definitely concur with the weather changes. In my experience I get headaches particularly with storms, the buildup is the worst bit. Once it is actually raining I am typically okay. Lots of rest, access to water... does Audrey have any pain relief recommended by her vet? \n\nI also must add, this is the sweetest thing. You sound like very caring people. We live in Scotland so the weather does not exactly change. \n\nIt goes from grey overcast to kind of darker grey and slight drizzle. \n\nShe is on gabapentin for pain relief. \n\nShe is on steroids just now to help reduce the amount of cerebrospinal fluid until she can get another surgery next year. \n\nShe had the initial surgery. \nHad a relapse after a week and she could not move. \n\nA kink had formed in the shunt  \n\nHad a second surgery and was great for a few months. \n\nNow she is developed a severe head tilt and is super wobbly. \n\nShe will need another surgery at the start of next year. Wee pet. I am in Northern Ireland myself. I would be wary of if it is 'muggy', but round about this time of year at least in NI it is fine. Sounds like you are doing the best you can. The best you can is all anyone should do. \n\nMy partner and I have had a terrible 2020 and wee Audrey is the highlight. \n\nEven with the \u00a314,000 vet bills. \n\n\nAlthough, if you know anyone that wants to employ a wonky collie pup, she needs to get a job to help pay her way. I have had hydrocephalus since birth and I have had 19 VP shunt revisions. I do not get frequent headaches unless I am having a malfunction. \n\nThe main thing to really look out for is overall behavioral changes. Lethargy is a big one. If your dog is usually very active and all of a sudden starts sleeping more and not wanting to play, that is a sign to take them to the vet. If you are on Facebook, ( about kitties with hydrocephalus might be of some use.  I would think dogs and cats would show similar symptoms (but I could be wrong). Yes. I get headaches 2 times a year or so my doctor said that one way to know is if you take aspirin or some other weak painkiller it will not help with a hydro headache.

Do not feel embarrassed at all, and to tell the truth, I have no idea how you have waited that long!! GO AHEAD!!! I understand; I was like that for two of my revisions/replacements too.

This is different for male and femxle patients tho is it not?  To my understanding the vagina is used as a jump point for surgery for femxles\u2026. That involves internal stitches in the uterus does not it? Do male patients experience this? Is their penis dilated for insertion of pain pumps into the abdomen? \n\nJust wondering :) Nahhh.. they only insert into the abdomen for the distal end of a shunt How is access gained to the abdomen This question has nothing to do with my post I know I am just curious if it is done through the vagina canal so there is no external evidence or if it is done through external surgery And it sorta does\u2026 if it is inserted vaginaly through the uterine lining that would require internal stitches and obv no penetrative sex And I said that it does not . My first brain surgery was not hydro related but it did kind of cause hydro, and I went about 3 months without a libido, the after that it was very low for all of last year because of my symptoms and the surgery being traumatic. :/  My second one where I got my shunt lessened my libido for about 2 months. I think anesthesia could have a lot to do with a lowered libido. But I do not see a medical reason that anyone *should* wait unless their doctor says otherwise.", "Programmable shunt not for me?

I am not sure how mission space has changed since i have gone on it, but I can tell you I have been on both. \n\nI can also tell you I have asked my neurosurgeon the \"rollercoaster viability\" question several times, always with the \"you are going to be fine\" response.

As of now roller coasters make me feel the way many people in the comment section are describing: Kind Of lethargic dizzy feeling. From what I remember from my last roller coaster ride is that I felt like I had a bad headache coming on but never actually got one. Its a weird feeling to describe and feel for awhile.  \nI would say Take many breaks and hydrate and just pace yourself. Be safe no matter what and I hope you have fun!

I have diagnosed myself with all sorts of conditions but they were all anxiety-related. I am not a doctor, but You do not have hydrocephalus. Unless you go to your GP and they determine you need and MRI and a neurologist tells you that you have hydrocephalus or a tumor, or anything else you seem worried about, you do not have any of this.

Only there is not anything of that sort in the video, the creator just tells you there is ultrasonic sounds that cause headaches and people (me included) really feel, at the very least, different, and some even in actual pain.   \n\n\nBasically I think you are priming yourself to be tricked. Stay off webMD and stay out of subreddits that deal with diagnoses you do not have--not saying you are not welcome, I just do not think it is good for you. Hydrocephalus is generally a slow thing (my surgeon said, like boiling a frog). Go see a doctor, you will not die of it in a few months. So just live your life until then. I take medication for anxiety. It helps.", "Curious questions Hello fellow humans, 30M here\n\nI have been finding fluid in my ears every now and then, probably once or twice a week. It tickles and it is wet, not after showering or anything. Which caused me to Google, why is there fluid in my ear. a few sites suggested Hydrocephalus which led me down the rabbit hole. \n\nUsually I would ignore the Google results but it started to make sense and I would like your opinions before I see an expensive doctor (USA).\n\nIt started when I was diagnosed with diplopia caused by a forth nerve palsy in my right eye a few year ago, out of the blue, I woke up and could not see straight. it resolved itself after 2 weeks with residual effects but doctors were puzzled, no brain injury no tumor. In the MRI they found I had an enlarged brain ventricle, just one, the right side (of the MRI so idk if it is a reverse image). The neurologist said it is fine and not to worry. I took his advice because he was out of network and I could not afford to follow up anyway.\n\nFast forward to now... I have always walked funny, and stairs are fun, hard to see the last couple steps. I walk a little staggered, cannot really walk in a straight line too well. I have never been able to follow the words in a book and end up reading the same line a few times before I find my place. A lot of this is related to diplopia. Are these the \"Eye problems\" and \"Difficulty walking\" that were described in my Google search results? \n\nCombined with the fluid in my ears and life long memory problems, I am worried my condition is serious. Or maybe it is all coincidence and I worry for nothing. Does anyone have an opinion? \n\nI read the Fact sheet on this subreddit and it is unfortunate there is not much research or development of treatments or cures, should I even bother pursuing a diagnosis? The fluid in your ears must come from somewhere, did you have a visit to check if your eardrum is ok? As much as i know CSF leaks are considered serious since they can lead to severe infections.\n\nIf you manage to collect some of the fluid it should be possible to find out if its CSF. Maybe that is not that expensive?\n\nAnd yes, Hydrocephalus is frustrating with no real cure. Lucky are the few ones that have working ETVs, shunts are associated with may problems, lifelong. But if you have a CSF leak that needs to be fixed anyway. My ear drums are ok, the ENT checked them out when I had other issues not too long ago. I also bought an endoscope off Amazon to monitor it myself among other things (nasal polyps). \n\nI will look into the collection process and cost associated with it. Thank you for the fast response and advice. I would go and get that checked out ASAP. If it is a CSF leak, then your risk of infection is incredibly high and the treatment process for that is very long, frustrating and in your case, could be extortionately expensive (speaking as someone that had to go through a CSF infection last year). \n\nRegarding your enlarged ventricle, I would also go and get that checked again. It could be causing pressure to build up on certain parts of your brain, which may explain some of the symptoms you are having. I know things are a little bit more tricky in the states but maybe try and find a different neurologist? Best of luck! Hello, just to say that if it is Hydrocephalous it is not the end of the world. Mine was discovered at 29 and I had some of the symptoms you describe. I had my shunt inserted 3 years ago and my life became infinitely better. \n\nIt is a horrible pain in the backside knowing you have it, and that at some point it may go wrong. However, it is manageable and honestly - the shunt did make everything better. I can now speak foreign languages, run faster and look better (weirdly) post shunt. So if it does turn out to be hydro, please do not feel horribly disheartened. Lots of people live with it and have totally normal lives. I got married this year - I am living proof. \ud83d\ude0a I think that is a good idea too, get a second opinion and maybe even a third. It is always been on my mind... no pun intended. Thank you for your advice! Thank you very much for the uplifting words. I am glad to hear you found relief with the treatment, I hope there is a solution for me too whether it is or is not hydrocephalus. \nI feel like I am foggy all the time and my quality of life has decreased significantly since I started to notice my symptoms. It would be great to have a one and done solution for all of it at once. Wishful thinking I guess. I am really happy you answered my post with such optimism, I needed that, thank you. Sorry, may i ask you about the CSF infection you have mentioned? Did it come out of the blue of after a shunt revision? If you do not mind, could you tell what symtpoms you have had and how the treatment was done? Of course! So I had an ETV in Aug 2020 as my first treatment. It failed after a week and they knew this because large amounts of CSF started leaking from the incision scar they would just created to perform the procedure. I had just been diagnosed, was very inexperienced so had no idea how bad this was. \n\nThey tapped the reservoir for a sample and the results showed I had a really bad infection. Treatment was an EVD (basically an external shunt attached to an IV pole that you have to take everywhere with you and have adjusted whenever you change position - the most annoying thing in all existence). I was also put on a 28 day course of 2 different types of antibiotics - the first type was given twice a day through IV and the second was put straight into my brain through a tube going into my head. \n\nI had to have 3 different EVD\u2019s during those 28 days because they kept on breaking/coming out of my ventricle/leaking. Overall it was incredibly taxing on my body, very painful and quite traumatising. You are not symptomatic so I do not think you will be treated. As for the CSF, taste it, if it is salty then it is CSF,if I recall... But like the rest of the comments, if it gets out then something can get in. I am so pleased it helped! And I hope you find out what is causing you your symptoms soon. And, again, if it is hydro, one of my best friends and my husbands groomsman also has Hydro and he runs marathons and tbh looks the spitting image of Ben Afflick and is partner at a finance firm. He has a VP shunt too. And he never gets a headache\u2026 the b**tard! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a My doctor always tells me it is my allergies", "Things just are not working out... Hello, I am having a hard time understanding my illness and am happy to find this group. I was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus when I was 4 and my very religious parents refused the demand of my neurosurgeon to place a shunt. I had MRI's till I was 6 and they said it \"stabilized\" and my parents just treated me like nothing was wrong growing up except I was not allowed to play sports. I was told I was normal and always held to the standards of my siblings, peers and later, co-workers. My whole life I have been treated like I am intentionally lazy, forgetful cause I do not care, selfish and other apathetic behavior I could not control. I also CANNOT multi-task. I can slowly do one thing at a time. I never did any homework growing up, barely got through school till 9th grade and dropped out because I felt I could not hack it. Part of the problem is that I have obsessively read and played instruments my whole life so since people saw me being proficient in those areas and looking pretty normal, they thought that my failures in other areas were just due to attitude. Fast forward to my 20's and I thought that I had ADHD and completely discounted the hydrocephalus as a cause of my distress. Treated with Ritalin with very little success. \n\nA couple years ago I had 2 severe concussions due to loss of vision (while still conscious) then falling and hitting my head on the ground. Since then my already embarrassing memory has degraded further. I lose track of conversations constantly, act impulsively, cannot remember tasks to complete and even wound up getting fired from a grocery store for not working fast enough despite my best efforts.  My personality has also changed drastically very frequently and I have a hard time controlling my speech/temper and have started stuttering. I used to be functional enough to run a decent wedding photo business but there is no way in hell I can now and my ex did most of the managerial work anyway. I just started seeing a neurologist and neurosurgeon but surgeon says I do not need a shunt. As much as I would like to avoid surgery, it seems like a shunt might help me based on my symptoms so now I feel lost on how to improve my condition.\n\n Are any of you on disability for Hydrocephalus? I am trying to get some financial help because I would absolutely be homeless without the support of my loving girlfriend and I do not want to depend on her like this any longer. Besides a shunt, have any lifestyle changes you have made improved your well-being? I have found that simple manual labor such as farming suits me well but I am worried about handling all the business responsibility should I start my own farm.\n\nSo pretty much, my life is a mess, I am hanging on by a thread, am losing my dignity and autonomy and this is making me very hopeless and depressed. Have any of you been dealing with these things or know any young adults with similar issues? Sorry to blab on here but I am very isolated and do not know what else to do. \n\nThank you, \n\nEli\n\n I had to go on disability about a decade ago after having at least 15 occasions within the span of a year and a half where overwhelming head pain forced me to leave work mid-shift. I was working in a private dining setup that worked on a skeleton staff so if I had an issue it meant that the rest of the team was up shit's creek. My pain flares are so unpredictable that holding any kind of regular work is next to impossible and deadline based stuff is just as risky because I never know how long an attack will last(some last up to 3 days). was it a long process to get on disability and have you been able to work in any conditions   (temporary) where your employers are supportive and understanding of your health problems? I have been on disability due to hydrocephalus. Everyone is story is going to be different but for me it was a MAJOR pain in the ass, lots of run around/paperwork.  I do not know if I would have been approved without my employers leave specialist.  She pretty much applied for me once I ran out of FMLA benefits through my job. It caused so much stress/anxiety.  I constantly felt like I was being judged, monitored, examined.  You are forced to work some total dicks.  One of my case workers called saying he wanted to make sure I was not \u201cjust having headaches\u201d while I was in the middle of a month long hospital stay, seizure after seizure, had an EVD and another shunt placed that got infected within a few days lol. They send paperwork every month requiring you to have scan after scan after scan.  They want you to PROVE that you deserve their pennies every month.  It took a huge toll on my self worth. 10/10 would NOT recommend.  \n\nI would recommend contacting the hydrocephalus association.  They may be able to help you either find work best suited for you with your skills/interests or help you apply for disability.  A disability lawyer could also be helpful.  Not exactly sure what that would entail though.  Just some sort of disability advocate.\n\nIf your daily life is being impacted I am thinking it is time for a shunt.  I would keep pressing your NS or maybe get a second opinion.  It does not make much sense that you would be having these issues and they would just shrug it off.  Regardless of what scans show, you know your body. Tell them shits not right and you want help! Is anyone going with you to the appointments to advocate for you? I am located in Canada and it took around a year I think (my memory is shite). I opted for disability because the unpredictability was just too much to expect of an employer anymore...there would be times where I was fine all day and walked into the building and had an attack on my way to the locker room. no warning for me or them.  I have given up trying to find anything that could remotely accommodate the daily hell that is my existence. Every employer I have had has been more than understanding but there comes a point where I just become a liability to them. My old job gave a hard time about FMLA and it was very discouraging. I think it may be time for a shunt though, I am sorry you are going through the ringer with this. I am now at a new job and letting them know when I am not feeling good feels like a hassle but at the end of the day your rights are protected. \n\nI have a VP shunt and it has changed my life. It is a minor set back for a Major comeback. \n\nPeace and prosperity for you my friend, we are all here for you I have hydrocephalus controlled with a vp shunt, myelomeningocele and major depressive disorder...I cannot get approved for disability to save my life. The depression and ADD are my bigger issues. I do not have too many episodes of crippling pain, but when I do have them ibuprofen and rest are the only things that help. I have recently started taking Melatonin and Magnesium for sleep and have noticed fewer headache flare ups the following day. Eli, \n\nYou mentioned about going blind? Do you know what is causing that? If not your doctors should further explore that and possibly do a Lumbar Puncture on you to get the opening pressure on your head to see if your pressure is too high and if you do indeed need a shunt. They can also do other things to help if you do not need the shunt. I know it is very difficult getting the doctors to hear what you are saying at times but the fight is worth it in the end you are your best advocate and you are tougher than anyone even realizes. Keep persistent with your doctors and do not quit until you get a good resolution and you start to feel some sense of your life coming back to normal!!", "33yr old shunt being replaced on November 4th Just found this sub!  I have a VP shunt that was placed when was 6 months old.  I had revisions at ages 6, 13, and 15.  I am now 48. In investigating an odd tingling feeling on the left side of my head, they found 2 tubing separations due to calcification.  Somewhat nervous about my upcoming procedure.  Wish me luck! I have a 7 year old daughter with a shunt.  She has had three revisions. I hope that she can get that amount of time out of this one. Good luck to you! I previously heard shunts do not typically last more than 20 years due to issues such as calcification. This post gives me some comfort! I will be at 20 years with my current shunt next summer (placed at age 8).\n\nGood luck! I just had one done on Friday for the first time in 10 years. Went really smooth, and went home the next day. Pretty nervous about the recovery, which is what I find to be the most difficult part, but after reading about people having 40+ revisions, I gained some peace of mind I know what you mean. The procedure itself does not worry me, just that I will not recover like I did at 15. Thanks!  From what I know, I have been very fortunate.  I wish you and your daughter the best of luck! We are here for you brother!  Keep us updated.  \n\nI am 39, last revision was 1993..I am hoping to go a few more years before a revision. Hi 39, last revision was 1993.., I am dad. I had mine put it in July 1986 when I was 10 weeks old. Never been revised. I often wonder when my time will come, or will it be permanent as-is without ever being replaced?\n\nDoes anyone here know what the longest time is with a VP shunt? Bad bot. I had one placed (well, \"revised,\")  when I was roughly 5 or 6. They said it would last into my teens, and I was 27 when I needed another revision. Correction: BadDadBot. ;) My record is 20 1/2 years between revisions. The recovery process was much easier with today's procedures. My current shunt is 8 years, 7 months old. Glad to hear there are others out there with decades between revisions. 33 years, no revisions here.\n\nI am worried if/when I will ever need a revision. Would I even know what signs to look out for, or will it simply be a very gradual decline towards something I will never actually notice?\n\nWhen I lived in England I asked my GP every few years for a check-up and was met with blank stares of \"if it are not broke, do not fix it\", so I just gave up asking because they did not understand the need when for all intents and purposes I am a perfectly normal and healthy adult (i.e., no visible signs/needs of any medical help or checks). Damn this is nice to hear lol. I am 20 going on 4 years with this bad boy (VP Shunt). I was just on here curious about when I would end up needing a revision. PRAYERS TO ALL THE SHUNTEES FOR LONG LASTING BOIS!! :) You all are amazing. I am 36 and have had a shunt since premature birth/hydrocephalus and I have never needed surgery since but I worry when/if that will happen. Oh it is cool to hear from others with an 1980s shunt! Mine was placed in 1980 - no revisions. My neuro refuses to mess with it :) I am same...have a bit of weird neck pain at the mo...cue slight shunt tube worry \ud83d\ude02", "Anyone had a VP shunt switched to a VA or VL(lung)? I have had several revisions that resulted in scar tissue from having VP shunts.\nA piece of an old shunt is calcified in me and my nsg mentioned that my high ICP might be caused by pressure on the distal end of the peritoneal area.\nHas anyone had it replaced to their atrial or lung and been stable since then? VA shunts seem much more popular than a shunt into the pleural cavity where the lungs are located. CSF is essentially a blood based product so putting it back into circulation makes a lot of sense. Putting it into the pleural / lung cavity seems like it carry\u2019s more risks. I have never actually heard of the peritoneal area being too pressurized that it causes intracranial pressure. Have you had that end of the catheter replaced often too? I had my VP shunt relocated to my pleural space.  I do not like it.  My body does not absorb the CSF as quickly is it did when it was in my abdomen.  Recovery has been tougher too. Ohhh noooo\nI told my nsg that I want to try VP again; there is a blockage in the catheter . That is why I have been on diamox again to keep my ICP from sweeping my optic nerves I wish I would have requested VP one more time.  I had two back to back revisions and the darn tube kept retracting back into the fat of my belly.  Very annoying.  Would not recommend. Omgggg:( those back to back surgeries are no joke\nI hope you are better now! I keep having surgery unfortunately Fingers crossed it sticks this time!  It is been 3 weeks since last revision.  Good luck with whichever method you end up deciding on! VP to VA - recovery seemed fine, adjusted well\n\nHave had 1 failure due to a blood clot forming on the distal end. Just got to take a baby aspirin everyday which I do not like lol\n\nOtherwise I would recommend How long have you had the VA? I ask because I am bout to have my eighth revision \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd Thank you so much! I have had the VA for just about a decade now! \n\nI have had 12 myself so far - the VA placement was #7 for me Oh wow! \nDo you work as well or have kids? I am employed - work at a bank full time. No kids yet. Could not fucking imagine dealing with both simultaneous to a shunt failure lol Well that is good! And I do not have kids either so I feel you. \nWell hopefully this will be the end of this madness :((( Fingers crossed, friend! I will be rooting for you", "Random ringing Does anyone experience random ringing in their ears? I have experienced this for as long as I can remember and thought I was going deaf at first, but it stops  after a minute or two. Also I was recently told muscle spasms can be linked to Hydrocephalus and have to go to the nurologist... my shunts are over two decades old and when I went last there was more  CFS fluid than notmal but not enough for it to be a concern. So I guess my question is, has anyone ever experienced this, and could it possibly be a sign of a shunt malfunction?  I think muscle spasms and ear ringing are just normal parts of life that everyone experiences from time to time. They certainly have not shown up with much frequency in my reading. I know I get both of them pretty frequently, but I am a hydrocephalus parent and do not actually have the condition. I would definitely consult your neurologist if you think you are experiencing any sort of new discomfort and nausea. Congratulations on the decades without a malfunction though. I can tell you that lots of parents and recently diagnosed people get scared because they hear about the less fortunate people who need revisions seemingly constantly. ", "Sounds It is been 8 months since my last surgery and I feel like my condition is improving other than the problems I have been having but I am seeing my surgeon about that. I went to get an MRI that he ordered and went home to take a nap. I was laying down and I started hearing this noise and I am thinking \u201cman he is breathing loud \u201c (my boyfriend) and then after a while I am realizing that it is a more mechanic noise. After a few minutes I realized that that noise was my shunt. I dint know If I am supposed to be able to hear it or what but now I cannot not hear it. \n         Have you experienced this??  What you describe sounds sort of like part of a symptom I had when my old 30 year old shunt started failing which happened back in february.  The breathing sound was in the ear opposite my shunt.  It almost sounded like wind picking up and settling down outside.  It only seemed to happen when I was laying in bed.  I started to get other symptoms like chronic migrains and what looked like a camera flash going off in my eye constantly.  I ended up going to the doctor and getting surgery and it all went away.  Still get minor headaches from time to tome though I also have trouble breathing sometimes and I am scared my surgeon is going to tell me I need another surgery or that I have asthma. I just started going back to school and I am getting married next month I dont have a shunt (fourth ventriculoscopy) but i heard a wooshing back and forth noise for years before my surgery. Sounded and felt like waves breaking on the ocean. Now 15 years later i hear it for just a second here and there. I have never had this sound before and I do not like it It was maddening. I damaged my eardrum when I was young shoving something sharp in there thinking there was water stuck. Hydrocephalus is fucking awful. I hope you find out what is up. You were right. I went to see my surgeon and he admitted me immediately. I am 6 days post op and he did way more then he usually does", "Does anyone have their shunt pressure at 6? Like my post yesterday my Aunt is in the ICU because she had a stroke due to high blood pressure. The doctors want to put a Shunt in her head. Can she be fully functional if her shunt pressure is only on 6? Her EVD pump is currently on 6. She is not able to handle it any higher than that. My regulates it self, it is a VP shunt and you cannot change the pressure on it, also do not know what the standard settings on an EP would be either \ud83d\ude15 wish I had more insight \n\nHope your aunt is feeling better soon Mine is at a 4 and my surgeon says it is too aggressive but it is working for me I have had it since Valentine's day and had to have it fixed March 4th of this year Thank you for your response I appreciate it (: What brand of shunt is it? Shunt makes use different settings. Thank you for commenting, but the doctors did not need to put the shunt in my Aunt after all. She is doing a lot better now ETV? I am sorry what is ETV? It is when they cut a whole in the brain to allow the fluid to move through Yes, I believe a EVT was performed. I had a programmable go shunt put in 2 months ago, due to my previous one over draining for a while.

It still did not help, so now they have adjusted it once again up to 8, and I can now function again. \n\nOn an 8 setting my shunt is basically shut. This is due to me having had almost no fluids for such a long time, and it is uncertain how long it will take for the fluids to get to normal levels. \n\nThe plan from my surgeon is to gradually open the shunt as my ventricular system opens up, and eventually use keyhole surgery to open up the ventricular system to a point where I will no longer need the shunt.

My son, who is almost 3 years old, has Hydrocephalus, bilateral cochlear implant\u2018s, heart issues (mostly resolved), and mild to moderate basal ganglia dysfunction.\n\nHe had his shunt placed at 2 weeks old and has had 8 revisions since. We recently noticed symptoms (vomiting, rolling eyes, he says his head is \u201ccold on the inside\u201d etc) and and rushed him to the hospital. They discovered a full blown shunt failure, they placed a new one three days ago, but again, it is not working so they have to go in again today and fix it.\n\nAny similar experiences? Thoughts, tips, etc. thank you I am so sorry. Poor little guy! My son has hydrocephalus too and has a VP shunt. I have found some Facebook groups to be very supportive try searching hydrocephalus or shunt or pvl (does your son have pvl? It seems many with hydro do). One of our friends kiddos had many many revisions in a short period of time and thankfully is now doing just fine. Best wishes to your little one! \n\n Thank you so much! He does not have pvl. We have looked into support groups, but have either found parents of kids with just hydro, or hydro with other issues including intellectual disabilities, which my son does not have.  He just turned 3 and is globally delayed but making good progress, he has apraxia and visual impairment and mild cp. He is close to walking on his own and tries to communicate and can see well enough to navigate our home. He has a great memory and knows all his body parts and partly memorizes books! He also has a genetic disorder and kidney disease  Wow! That is actually a lot in common! Mind if I messaged you? I would love it! I am always happy to meet other parents who are going through similar things :)  Never had a full failure. My daughter had a few clogs so far. It she is a little younger and has no other lasting conditions. Apparently as their brain develops the cathedar can get grown into and clogged. Once their brains are more developed the odds of needing revisions drops off. I have been meaning to pack a \u201cgo bag\u201d but am luckily close enough to a Children\u2019s hospital that it is not terribly tough to swing back home if we get admitted/need surgery. I wish I had a magic answer. The best I have been able to get from any doctor is that they should grow out of needing so many revisions and that revisions are pretty common the first 2 years.

It felt miraculously better. The Monday they took 15 CCs of CSFluid for cisternogram. Then they did a draw and took 40 of whatever was on the draw. Thursday. By then I had recovered from incontinence and after the shunt, within a week I cut paid meds. 50% less on morphine and down to  1/4 of Dailey.  oxycodone. Had a great month then pain started coming back and the started talking about adjusting shunt. I read it is pretty normal to have to ask st it a few times. Wondering, how many times were you adjusted. A few days after I was discharged following a shunt revision, I was having symptoms of another blockage so my mum decided she was taking me back to the hospital. Before we left, I used the loo to do a number two and fluid started running down the side of my face. In my not-very-with-it state, I assumed there was a leak coming from the ceiling (though it was a bedroom on the floor above) and did not think of telling anyone.\n\nNext day, post-surgery, my surgeon asked if I remembered my head being wet, and I recalled the incident. What had actually happened was the pressure of doing a number two caused a mini geyser of csf to erupt through the still-healing wound, but in my confused and then drugged state, I just never thought to tell anyone and so they were confused why I had damp hair... Until they reopened the wound and saw my busted shunt valve.\n\nI personally found this hilarious then, and still do, but the surgeon certainly didnt, and neither does my mum, and everyone else just looks awkward when I tell the story! I had a VP shunt and my appendix burst when I was 14. Because of that they were afraid of infection and moved my shunt line to drain to my pleural cavity (VPL). But the neurosurgeon only shaved half my head. While in recovery I figured out there was a salon in the hospital and hoped they would shave my head for me. I get to the salon in a wheelchair, with an IV in, and the bandage still on the shaved side. I ask the lady if I she can do it. She looks at me, shakes her head, and says \u201coh no way! I cannot, it is like\u2026.\u201d She paused, I assumed she would say it is a liability, but no. \u201cIt is like gross.\u201d I have a VP shunt that is no longer functioning, because my hydrocephalus was obstructive in nature and was remedied by a second surgery to remove whatever it was that was blocking the flow of CSF. So it is been chillin for 20 years.\n\nI work in the emergency department, and a lot of the time, the doctors really only see shunt malfunctions that are acutely infected and rarely see someone with a VP shunt just walking around. So I pointed it out one day, and I had about three of the residents and one of the attendings all crowd around me and look at it. They seemed fascinated that they would never noticed it before. One of them had just thought I had an overly prominent SCM! HAHAHAHA OMG IVE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE My first shunt got an infection  which ended in a laparotomy and appendectomy a few days after insertion. New shunt was then placed on left side, 2 years later and counting Sorry, so many questions since newly shunted. Did anyone with acquired NPH vs those born with it have any sexual symptoms with it? Since I had a hemorrhage it could be damage from the bleed not the pressure. Hypothalamus-Adrenal-Putuitary Axis issues? Kind of hoping shunt will help with this and other brain stem issues like Central Sleep Apnea. Might be old hat to you but looking for some hope so anything would be useful. If you are in a similar boat on diagnosis : look for Neuropsychological Sequelae of \nSubarachnoid Hemorrhage and it is Treatment by B.O. H\u00fctter. Publisher SpringerMedicine. SpringerWein New York. Goes in and out of print. Be careful to ensure its an English edition unless your and you speak German. I found nothing printed in English. It could be because over 98% of us are dead after the first week. Maybe survival has gotten better since 2001. Makes sense that Europeans would have a published metadata because with socialized all data on a person is in one place. Here it rests with every Dr who has treated you if you are lucky. Luckily my oldest son does research on brain function and cognitive issues and was published as a Co-author while still technically a Senior at M.I.T. He  summarized the 154 pages of the metadata to 12 pages of print + 19 pages of references. When I took that to the last Cognitive/Dementia Neurologist he said he would finally read it and concurred with the NPH  diagnosis enough to test it. I had been to the \"best\" hospitals in the states of Texas, Wisconsin and Arizona as well as Mayo in Minnesota and TIRR brain research hospital in n Houston. Biggest problems were very few if us survive and not enough research on topic. I thought my son could find more with his research credentials, he is working on PhD at Yale but even for him there is very few studies. If there are they tend to be for people born with it vs those of us who Acquired it mostly Post Brain Hemorrhage. Anyone who is still fighting, I hope this helps. If you have other information, please share. I have seen pre and post shunt &amp; CFS FLUID DRAWS WHICH show in color slides of brain with red showing as blood that is supposed to be there vs the pre MRI slides that shows how little blood is in the brain in the pre slides confirming what I said all along about HBP being post hemorrhage not cause of hemorrhage. Once brain pressure was so high body could not really push it up enough to actually get forced into the brain. If you are in the trenches keep fighting, just decide you are hard to kill. If the stats say you are going to die remember I have held out since 2001. There is always a how to live as long as you have a why to live. My youngest is starting UT engineering in the fall. I said would be around to prepare him for this. I can let go and die but fuck it. I am going to go on for a better/effective treatment plan. Cheers. I have had hydrocephalus since I was a baby from a subarachnoid cyst. I have been shunted since 1995 but I still have pituitary issues from it.

That was not what I expected. I am actually relieved. Hope it all goes smoothly!  Thank you Fellow two-shunter here. My first one is non functional but too old to remove. Hang in there! Thank you.

Right is 7th in December 2016 ", "Unexplained shunt pain I am 18 and had 2 shunt revisions in August and October of 2018, in August I had the catheter replaced and in October I was given a programmable shunt. I have been having problems with it and had it adjusted up and down multiple times. Yesterday I went to get an MRI because the pain has been unbearable, but the scan looked completely normal and my incision is healing perfectly according to the doctor. Does anybody know what else could cause pains similar to shunt malfunctions? Do any of the doctors know what your ventricles look like at normal pressure?  The MRI should show the size of your ventricles and depending on their size compared to normal should give an idea as to which way to program the valve.  That is disappointing that your doctors do not have the valve pressure dialed in yet.  I would think based on your description that any symptoms that feel like a shunt malfunction would just be the valve sitting at the wrong pressure. I have been going to the same hospital since I was born and have been checking in with my head every time I get headaches like I have been advised, my doctor brings up my MRI scans from after my August surgery when he fixed my shunt because they were normal then. But every setting he is put my shunt on has had some kind of symptom like I would normally get when I have malfunctions. For the most part they are either really big or really small, but after my scan yesterday they compared it to the August one post op and saw it was exactly the same size I have been going to the same hospital since I was born and have been checking in with my head every time I get headaches like I have been advised, my doctor brings up my MRI scans from after my August surgery when he fixed my shunt because they were normal then.

For the most part they are either really big or really small, but after my scan yesterday they compared it to the August one post op and saw it was exactly the same size Odd.  If that is the case then I do not want to venture any guesses since your neurosurgeon has more information and the training necessary to make a diagnosis (sorry that they cannot it seems).  If your shunt was fine after the August revision perhaps you could ask for whatever valve you had before the programmable one was put in in October?", "Did anyone has already got treatment but still have headache? This was the fourth time for me to have the hydrocephalus surgery. Last two times,  everything was doing pretty well. I did the fourth operation because of the third time was an unsuccessful operation. Unfortunately, the fourth operation is still failed. At first, I thought it can be OK. And I went to school to have classes. When we thought it find, then the things go wrong. I have headache after the operation about a month. (I had the operation in 2019) I still have headache until now. Surgery is a trauma to the body. The brain can overcome a lot, but it takes time. Part of your recovery may be that you continue to have headaches. After my last surgery when I was 16, I still got headaches, although they were better than before surgery, and I found it very hard to go back to school because I was exhausted and finding it hard to focus. I know it is hard, but you have to give your brain and body time to come back from this. I hope you feel better soon! That is terrible. I am so sorry. Yeah I get headaches, but it is not constant. If your last procedure was in 2019 and you are still having bad headaches (above and beyond typical headaches), you should let your doctor know. I just had my shunt repaired 4 weeks ago and have headaches maybe once every few days now, but not everyday, and not as bad as when it was broken, when it was basically 24/7 pain. My last vp shunt revisions were in August 2016 and December 2016. I still have migraines and other issues to some extent on a daily basis. I have been checked out and my health care \u201cprofessionals\u201d have said there is nothing more they can do in my own experience and I have to deal with it. I have had hydrocephalus since birth and I have had 7 shunt revisions over my life so far. \n\nHopefully you get well soon, OP. Thanks body, how about you nowdays? Hope your future will be better and smooth. My doctor told me that might be the pressure is not appopriate for the brian. Then the doctor adjusted the pressure to solve the problem. But the pressure always not appopriate. Then we choose the best the choice of all the choices that we could make in all the pressures. Recently I saw an new tech, it might be an solution the problem. It is called ESHUNT. Unfortunately, the first patient who has the surgery with it in feb 2021.", "What does \u2018arrested Hydrocephalus\u2019 mean?

So do I still have hydro or not lol My wife was diagnosed with Arrested Hydro incidentally when checking for some other hormonal issues. Doctors said that its congenital and there is no increased ICP and that she does not need any surgery or shunting as her systems are balanced. She does have headaches which doctors suggest that are migraine and tension headache. Other than that she has no symptoms. Its like it just appear in the scan as enlarged ventricles but fluid movement pathway is established by the body somehow. Well, hydro is excessive water. Without the shunt most will have the excess water return.", "..i am just happy to be alive, and able to compete.  It is extra funny cuz I just got 3rd in my division for a rock climbing competition I live in Vancouver BC and I used to race a local Mountain Trail hill called the GrouseGrind.

I have an untraventrivular stent and it is left me in fairly good shape until now (maybe). Want To compared. At 25, I got hydro when removing a benign brain tumor from my R ventricle.  The resection created scarring, and the cyst caused by that was hydrocephalus.  CSF was now trapped and building. \n\nIt got bad fast but the doctor surgically cleared out the scar tissue and added a stent to connect the halves of my ventricle that were separated, in case it grew back.  After the surgery I felt like crap for probably 2 years, convinced there was not free flow of csf, but eventually I started feeling normal.  Most days after I did not feel any discomfort or symptoms. I would forget this nightmare happened to me. \n\nNow over the last months I have started to feel some of the symptoms I had right after that stent implant surgery.  I also took HGH (human growth hormone) for IvF, so wondering if some of was increases cellular growth from that, tho my neuro doubts it. \n\nNow I have a dull headache, feel like there is a pressure bubble in my head, and am forgetting names more than usual.  \n\nAnyone relate and have this kind of treatment or anything?", "When is it not just a headache? I know I ought to ask my neurosurgeon about this kind of thing, but I am still waiting for an appointment.\n\nI had a shunt revision in February, which I mentioned here:\n\n\n\nI had to have the setting adjusted a month and a half ago when I was getting headaches with increased light sensitivity. It was fine for a while again, but for the last two days, I have had headaches come and go, usually worst right after waking up. It ranges from barely there to quite painful but not emergency-level.\n\nFrom browsing the sub, I gather that headaches are supposedly normal even with a perfectly functional and properly-adjusted shunt. When I had my Medos valve, however, I **never** had severe headaches except before failure. This makes me skeptical of the normalcy of headaches. So I am going to see my surgeon when possible.\n\nIf headaches are truly normal, when are they something to be treated with painkillers vs something to go to the hospital for? Is it a matter of having other symptoms?\n\nThanks in advance! If your shunt is failing you will have other symptoms. Confusion, cant look up with tour eyes, lethargy, etc. I have had failures without other symptoms. If your headaches are increasing in frequency (even if they are not increasing in severity) especially within 2 years of a surgery, that is a big red flag. \n\nIn my experience (19 shunt revisions) even shunt headaches start out being treatable by over the counter headache medication. As the frequency increases, the effectiveness of OTC medication decreases until it is really obvious there is a failure. \n\nIt might be nothing, but it is good that you are seeing your NS. Trust your instincts too. You know your own body more than anyone else. If it is not normal for *you* then it is not normal. This is not always the case. It depends on each person and the severity of the malfunction. Headaches are not \"truly normal\". Your shunt seems to be having drainage issues or there could be some slow malfunction. I would definitely make sure you get answers and not just the wait and see approach. A good rule of thumb is how the pain reacts to over the counter medicine. If you take advil and the headache goes away, it was simply a headache. However if you take advil and nothing changes or gets worse, it is likely a headache to worry about. However, in most cases of an actual failure, you will see other symptoms like lethargy, confusion, sudden irritability, light sensitivity, nausea / vomiting, etc.", "does a vp shunt revision leave an extra stomach scar? (Stupid question, I just want to make sure lol) F17. I have had 2 VP shunts- one at birth and a revision at 6months. \n\nI have a backwards L shaped scar on my stomach but the vertical part kind of overlaps which made me think they were separate scars.\n\nIdk why I thought they would go off the same scar so it would still be the same scar/ place but just look a little different \ud83d\ude02 I am 36 and have had a vp shunt since birth. I also have a vertical scar on my stomach. However, last year my shunt finally failed. They replaced my 35 year old shunt with 2 programmable shunts.\n\nNow I also have a horizontal/lateral scar on my stomach that is from the most recent surgeries I had. I am not sure why they gave me a new scar.\n\nMy guess is because they had to feed in two new shunt tubes for the new programmable shunts. In my case they did. They had to add more tubing; not sure why they could not use the same spot, but I have 3 different scars (the first one is a lot bigger and more noticeable, the other two are barely visible at this point). Mine did but it was right next to the other so they blend in with each other.  Sort of similar to what you have, only mine is not an L shape, just vertical. probably trying to minimize the scarige (not a word). I have got one like that and I was old enough to know where my scars were and yes they just L-ed it into one scar. I have had it done twice actuatlly. it is hard to reclose a spot with scar tissue. It causes issues with closing back up. When I was 18, my scalp was so thin from them doing entry points next to each other that it broke open while i was brushing my hair. They tried to seal it up but they ended up doing cosmetic surgery to remove an inch on my scalp to close it. It depends, I think. I have had 3 shunt surgeries in all and there was about 15 years between surgery 2 and surgery 3, so scar tissue had built up over time. That made it harder for my team to know where to put the distal end (the part that goes in your peritoneal cavity). They had tried to go in where my old scar was, but they ended up calling in a general surgeon, who made an incision about three times the length of the old one. Left a really gnarly scar and I am almost 10 years post-op but you can still see where the stitches were.", "I think my Mom has NPH - looking for advice Hi I am the caregiver for my 75 year old Mother. For the past five or so years her gait has changed. Intially she began to noticeably shuffle her feet and take shorter steps.

I remember they mentioned that the ventricles are slightly enlarged but never mentioned it again.\n\nThey diagnosed her with vascular parkinsonism and prescribed her medication for Parkinsons. It did not help and her symptoms have slowly progressed. She probably has some level of cognitive issues but it is hard to say whether that is due to age or a disease.

We live in San Diego, and we are having such a hard time gettig answers from doctors. \n\nMy s/o was diagnosed in July of this year (2018) and had a VP Shunt placed. Consequently, he cannot work or drive. Since then, things have been getting more and more difficult. It seems no doctor has any answers for us about pretty much anything. He is under emergency medi-cal, and the hospital that he had to have the immediate surgery in does not accept medi-cal for any follow up appointments, so we have had to find a different clinic for him to go to. Recently, we had an appointment with the top neurosurgeon at a prestigeous hospital, where we were told he reviewed my s/o\u2019s case and wanted to speak with him directly. We waited over a month and turned down sooner appointments because we thought he would be able to help us more. \n\nAt the appointment, the doctor had no information on my s/o. He did not even know he had the surgery, and was surprised to learn that. My s/o has had what he thought were seizures before, but this doctor tells us they do not sound like seizures and even looks unpleasantly surprised when he is told my s/o went through the surgery. \n\nHe then proceeds to tell my boyfriend that he still will be unable to work and drive for the next couple months and he ordered a EEG and a CAT scan for my s/o. At this point, no doctor has given us any answers on why my s/o gets headaches, if they are normal, where he is supposed to be innrecovery, how his brain looks now, it is very frustrating. I cannot find a single doctor in the area who can help us. He needs a job. He has no money. What can we do?? Please help us, advice, kind words, anything. Feel free to ask for more details. We are at the end and need help. Thank you.  To start, it is really fantastic that your s/o has you as a support system, it is more important than you could ever realize. \nUnfortunately because there is not that much known about hydrocephalus, doctors are not too keen to try new things.

Yeah surgery is needed \nGood luck About 14 years ago mine broke in my neck. It took a while for the pressure to build up, so it was unclear how long it was broken for before I was rushed into the OR. You will need to go under to have a new catheter put in.

For me, I notice that rapid changes between hot and cold weather or changes in barometric pressure really affect my headaches, tinnitus, and vertigo sensations. While I usually just live with the varying levels of those three symptoms, weather changes can aggravate them to the point where it is extremely uncomfortable.  I assume you have a vp shunt? I am learning as much as I can for my 3 year old.  Got it, yes it is a VP shunt. It is actually my 2nd one, my first one worked fine for many years until it did not, but even then I was non-symptomatic for about 10 years after the first shunt was deemed non-functional. Then one day it hit me like a ton of bricks, causing docs to reevaluate and ultimately put it my 2nd one about 2 years ago. \n\nAs far as the weather goes, I have heard it is very bothersome for some people, and not at all for others. After 2 years of research and experience, I really believe there is some common ground between sufferers of hydrocephalus, but a lot of unique experiences as well.

Never had a any problems, the shunt just stopped working when I was around 9 years old and I also did not need it anymore. I am 34yo now.\n\nSince then, I still have it, just because the doctors said if there are no problems, I can just leave it in to not risk any damage during surgery if they would take it out.\n\nDid not really have any problems, do and did sports a lot, I do not have a lower IQ, I can process everything instantly, no problems walking, speaking or anything.\n\nBut there are quite a lot of problems I think are 99.9% ADHD. My mum thinks it is not ADHD, but the shunt. I do not think that is the case because a lot of problems are not also common in cognitive problems you hear about in shunt patients.\n\nNow there is the problem. I cannot find any material or information about adults with a shunt that is not active since they are a child and with no ongoing medical problems. Which makes me wonder: Am I the \"only one\" that grew up without major medical problems?\n\nMaybe some of you could help me out and shed a bit of light onto this situation or know where I can get more information. You are certainly not the only one to not have any additional medical issues. I also was diagnosed as a baby and for the first 20 years of my life you would not even know that I had hydrocephalus. I had my shunt taken out and then put back in a month later (turns out I do need it) but still have no additional issues. \n\nI would not say it is shunt related, but each person is different. Hope this helps! Thank you for taking the time to answer and give advice.\n\nI am kind of having a hard time having a discussion with my mum about that topic, because she is stuborn and always says that because the doctors said that I MAY get problems with focus and memory, now everything is because of that. I mean, being delivered too early (4 weeks in my case) is being linked to have a way higher risk of having ADHD and that is also a thing she does not want to hear.\n\nI suspect that the truth is that she does not want to take responsibility for having me misdiagnosed (a psychologist tested me before I started school and said I do not have ADHD, which I now think was not the truth, visiting a psychologist the end of the month to get a diagnosis).\n\nSo in your case, you still need the shunt, but you do not have cognitive impairments?\n\nSorry for diving into some topics that are not directly connected to a hydrocephalus, but I do really need to know if my assumption is right and it in fact is very likely to be ADHD and not have the nearly 35 symptoms I am meeting for ADHD be caused by something else. So my story is pretty similar, although I have also had brain tumors as part of my medical history. \n\n\n20 years after my shunt was placed we realized it was broken but still sort of draining through calcification. Did not need to touch it or add any additional drainage after testing.\n\n\nI have also had random symptoms similar to ADHD but put them aside assuming it was due to all of my medical history until recently. I spoke to my neurologist and a psychiatrist earlier this year and agreed to try ADHD treatments. \n\n\nI have to tell you it is insane how much of a difference there is. I have been on medication since February and while the brief euphoria is over I can work like what I now realize is how a normal person would. Oh, that is really interesting. If I got that right, you say there may be a connection to your ADHD symptoms and your medical history (shunt, head surgery, etc.), but nonetheless, the ADHD medication did hugely improve your life?\n\nThis would be so awesome if the psychiatrist would confirm my assumed ADHD and if medication would really help. That would really ease the suffering from more than 25 years of pain, bad experiences, teachers and family members just calling me lazy, low self estem and constantly (to this day) thinking something is wrong with me and that I do not have the same potential as others. Have strong adhd.  Causes focus problems but never brain fog.  \n\nStarted having severe brain fog.\nWas due to a mix of autoimmune condition, IIH, and micro clotting.  \nGoing on blood thinners solved most of the brain fog for me.   \n\nKeeping IIH under control helps.\nKeeping inflammation down from autoimmune condition helps a lot.\n\nMy ability to stay on task was fixed by aderral, but it made inflammation in my body much worse.  So I had to stop it. So you still have a Hydrocephalus and an active shunt?\nAnd on top of that you have autoimmune condition, Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (which I assume is IIH) and micro clottings? Are these all separate conditions or are they tied together?\n\nAnd do you think that your adhd has its roots in those conditions?\nAnd the inflammations are because of the autoimmune condition? There is something called co-morbidity, which simply means that two medical conditions commonly happen together and when they do, there is a lot of overlap in symptoms. &gt;Hydrocephalus\n\nNo shunt.  I was scheduled to get one, but insurance.\n\nI think adhd by itself did not. The medication on the other had caused pressure to rise, and inflammation to increase.\n\nAutoimmune is the normal source for inflmation. Yes exactly. Each of my doctors pointed out that the symptoms could be associated with any part of my medical history, but ultimately the treatments worked well for me so what does that matter haha. \n\nBest of luck! It can be really hard to tease apart the causative reason for attention and focus issues. My son has Hydrocephalus and a VP shunt from the time he was an infant. He demonstrated pretty classic symptoms of ADHD and executive functioning disorder when he was in elementary school. We agreed to have him tested when he was in 3rd grade and he did qualify as Other Health Impaired bc of ADHD. I decided to also get testing done because I knew that there is a history of attention issues in my family. My testing results were quite similar to my son. This was helpful to him bc he knew it is likely that being shunted is not the primary reason he has those challenges. He is used medication for ADHD and has found benefit from it. \n\nI would consider pursuing testing if I were you. If you think you have ADHD type symptoms, you might really benefit from support to know how to compensate for those issues and potentially meds. Best of luck! Thank you very much for taking the time to answer. I already scheduled an appointment with a psychologist for the end of the month to get tested. I literally check 95% of all the main ADHD symptoms, so I would be surprised if I am not getting diagnosed for ADHD.\n\nIt really gives me a lot of hope, seeing the possibility that it can get better. That I am not being held back forever because of my medical history. Because having suffered from many negative experiences in my life (lost great friends, ended relationships, not being able to use my academic potential, etc.) that were 100% caused by ADHD symptoms, I started to think like \"success and a good life just are not for me\". Just having a psychologist prove to me that it was not my fault would mean the world to me.\n\nAnd I would love to solve the situation with my mother. Have her believe that my problems are ADHD related and are not coming from the shunt. I mean, I forgive her for not having me properly diagnosed when I was a preschooler, because she did not know better and you cannot turn back time. It is mainly about being believed. That is a tough situation for sure, and I am sure that others have had something similar. I do still need the shunt, but I have no cognitive impairments, at least that I have been officially diagnosed with. I do not know much about ADHD or other comorbid disorders, but my shunt also stopped working when I was 9 and I do not need it anymore since then. The doctors also told my parents to not take it out the equipment for now, as taking it out would may mean more risk then leaving it there. I am 25 now. I did have a revision twice, but that is not much compared to what others have, so I consider myself lucky. Wow, so you have been told you do not need it anymore, but still you had to have it \"renewed\" two times after that? Or did you have the revisions before it stopped working since the age of 9?\n\nAlways read about revisions when it comes to the shunt and I am curious as to how this works, because (luckily) I never had even one. Shunt is just still inside, but doing nothing at all, since I was 9. I had 1 full shunt revisio before 1 years old because it did not work well. I had another surgery so they could make the shunt longer because while it worked fine, I just outgrew it and it didnt reach my stomack area. I went to regular chekups every year, at 9years old the liquid was still in the shunt but at 10 they noticed that there is no liquid and I am totally healthy without it, spntaneously the liquid can go through my spine as it should so they never changed it and never took it out either. \n\nSo just like you, it doesnt do a single thing since I was 9. It is the same with you? I guess it is better not to take it out, surgery is a big infection risk. Yes, my parents told me I also was 9 when the doctors told me at a checkup, that it is now without function and taking out would only be a risk. \n\nI mean, of course when locating it with my fingers, I can feel it going over my collar bone and behind my ear, I can even feel the small synthetic \"valves\" behind my ears. But that is it. No problem at all, even when doing martial-arts or when I did wild stuff all the other children did. People do not even see it, when I do not tell them.\n\nSo it is awesome that modern medicine could already do these wonders 34 years ago.  \nAnd it is super interesting to read about the experiences of others that had a similar medical history. wow even martial arts? it is a big fear of mine that I am not allowed to do it because it would be dangerous. is it painful if they hit you on the neck where the shunt is? It really is not. Not more painful than any other hit on the collar bone. And I was doing Judo, Taekwondo (competitive Level) and Full contact karate, so no \"light- or no-contact\" stuff. I was hit on the head no-padded a few times in my head, fell on my head, had a concussion, stuff like that, without a problem.\n\nI have just read, the shunt could have cracked, but since it is without function since I am 9 (before I started martial-arts), it should not be a big problem if it happens.\n\nRegardless of that I always told myself that I would not let something like this control my life and stop me from doing what I want. I mean, do not become suicidal, but do not become way too sheltered either.", "Health insurance worries I am about to turn 26 and age out of my parents health insurance.\n\nWhat I am confronted with is $600/mo cobra cost or alternative state insurance that is not much better. \n\nSometimes it is lonely as my friends and siblings all pay super cheap health insurance and here I am at 26 paying for the most expensive plan my employer/state has to offer because of my hydrocephalus. (Sorry if I sound whiny.) \n\nAnyone have tips/advice/stories for navigating health insurance? (Unemployed or employed) ppo v hmo etc? What do you use and why? Cobra is definitely an expensive bandaid. Personally we always do the math on our plans and try and see how the costs would work out with each deductible vs premium. It is a good exercise for most people to do in my opinion. At the moment we are not having annual revisions so we have been gambling on higher deductibles and low premiums. When things have been worse we have chosen a high premium and a low deductible. It is a crap shoot and a scam in my opinion. The health insurance system in America is just an expensive coupon system and the only one who truest benefits is the insurance company. Can you look into Medicaid if your income qualifies? It covers everything  and you do not pay for it :) I am currently paying $1,200.oo/m for United Healthcare coverage.  My neurosurgeon will not accept Obamacare so I am pretty much fucked.  Since I have had 5 different brain surgeries I can also forget about  being able to qualify for life insurance too.  \n\nIt really sucks that the American healthcare system holds uncontrollable medical issues against you.  It is not like any of us asked for this.  I had two brain surgeries two and a half years ago that I am still paying for.  Even after insurance my part was almost $10k. It does not cover everything it covers services that are medically necessary at the least costly most  medically appropriate level.\n go to health.gov if you are in the US. See if your state is in the exchange. Then talk to them.\n\nDo not compare others situations. Your worry is a valid one. We do not know when our shunts will fail, if they will\u2026\n\nMedicaid works; you just have to know how to use it. Obamacare is the ACA. You mean your neurosurgeon accepts United Healthcare, which is a health plan, which I am assuming you are paying through your employer? Because if not, you got it through the ACA; which would be the health care exchange for your state.\n\nYou are welcome.", "Muscle spasms Hi! I have had Hydrocephalus all my life and have been experiencing muscle spasms throughout my legs and hands. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this, and if so how to handle it. \n I have never had muscle spasms during the day. Sometimes if I am trying to fall asleep one of my legs will randomly twitch for half a second, but I personally attribute that to something like restless leg syndrome, which I think is common for people to get as they are in bed. I think if there is anything muscle-related to watch out for, it would be like lack of balance or coordination. My hydro has not given me many issues for the past two decades though, so maybe I am not the best to get advice from haha OmG I thought it was just me and the fact that my shunt is messing up. Yes and they hurt!!!", "Sore scalp Hello. I wanted to see if anyone else may have had a similar experience with a symptom. I am 51 and had a shunt placed about 9 months ago for hydrocephalus. Everything seems to be working well but I get scalp soreness as the day progresses. No headaches just a soreness on my scalp kind of like if you hit your head on something. All my CT and MRI scans have not showed anything out of the ordinary. My Neurologist does not have any answers which is a little surprising. It is bearable but it is just a little concerning. Thanks for any input. Is your itchy sensation around the incision? No but It is usually on the side of the my shunt but I also sleep on that side My daughter itches at hers more than any other spot on her head. It also was interestingly the first place she grew hair. If you are interested I would look up the layers of tissue on your head. There are quite a few, but your hair and scalp are separated from your cerebrospinal fluid pathway by your skull. Your exterior discomfort should not theoretically be effected by anything going on inside.  Wow thank you. I will read about that. I had not given any of this much thought until my surgery. I guess you kind of just take things for granted Csf is really cool. It is definitely not something most people think about though. The ( has some pretty good descriptions too. I really enjoy anatomy and was put in a position where learning about it helped me cope with my daughters situations. I am a month post op for my shunt and I have been getting this too, usually after waking up and then again in the evening until I go to sleep. Sometimes a light scalp massage helps. 10 months ago I had a different kind of brain surgery, and my scalp soreness lasted up to 2-3 months post op. I suppose how long it lasts varies based on how your nerves were effected by the incisions... Has your neuro considered something similar to trigeminal neuralgia? I would think there has been some damage to your nerves. I know I have some because there is a spot on my head where I cannot feel anything since the operation, and around it is usually where my soreness is the worst. Yes that is when I can get it a little bit in the morning and then at night. usually l put a ice pack on my head to go to sleep it is kind of a pain but it works. \nIt is difficult to get answers from the neurologist sometimes. It is normal to have a sore scalp because with the shunt being on the skull under the scalp, the skin on your head gets stretched which causes the scalp pain. Hello thanks for your reply. There is not a ton of information out there for the symptoms you experienced with hydrocephalus and shunts. My neurosurgeon is/was awesome but they basically just turn you loose because there done with their part.", "Draining of cysts I know this is more tumour related but in the coming weeks I (M14) will be having a cyst draining operation. I have had a VP shunt for the past year and its worked perfectly at the pressure of 10 but I started getting symptoms again and when they did an MRI, they found one of the cysts had slightly grown in the past 2 months. I hope this all turns out well but I dont know the definite outcome Good luck mate, you will be fine x Ty, I will post an update when I have had the surgery. We dont know when it is but they said in the coming weeks Good luck my dude, trust these doctors, they know what they are doing. Do you remember if your cyst is located in a ventricle or not? Or perhaps which ventricle? Everything is going to be ok. I could be in a very similar position soon. I have fixed low-mid vp shunt but also have a cyst. Cyst has grown into the space made where they debulked part of the tumour, I had not felt the impact if that because of the shunt but I am starting too. \nThink for me they said if it did become a problem they would insert an ommaya reservoir ( this can then be drained manually)\n\nGood luck You too, I have pins and needles in the entire right of my body which I can now barely move. I just got to last with these symptoms until this operation. Hope your situation gets fixed I do not know but I saw the scan images and it has grown, pushing into the right side if my brain, I have pins and needles down the right side of my body of which I can barely move now.

Also if you want to be part of it I can put in a few words on how you struggle with this disease or your feelings about it Interested :) dms are open Dm me", "Has anyone in this group ever been pregnant with a hydrocephalus and VP shunt? This is baby #2 for me. I did not know this group existed until now and I am curious if anyone else has a VP shunt and gone through pregnancy. I am 26F and I was diagnosed with hydrocephalus brought on by aqueductal stenosis and had a shunt placed at birth. Between birth and 4 years of age I had 4 revisions, but I have been complication free for the past 22 years except for the occasional migraine and blindness in one eye. I am currently pregnant with baby #2 after an uneventful pregnancy and birth (at least as far as hydrocephalus is concerned) in 2019. I am hoping for the same this time and am cautiously optimistic but I am still nervous. Hey! I have never been pregnant but I would love to hear about your experience being shunted and giving birth - what was it like? Did you have to watch out for anything? \n\nI am 25F &amp; I want to start having kids soon. I was diagnosed with hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal stenosis last year and the thought of giving birth while shunted kind of scares me a little! So I was followed by Maternal/Fetal Medicine (MFM- the high risk group) really closely. My anatomy scan at 20 weeks was also much more in depth than the typical anatomy scan because they wanted to be extra sure whether or not the baby had hydrocephalus. I was induced a couple of weeks early both for my blood pressure, but also because the bigger the baby got the more I would have to exert myself to push him out and they did not want to risk pressure building up in my head because of it. They did not want to perform a C-section unless absolutely necessary because they did not want to be digging around in my stomach and potentially dislodge or block the shunt tubing. The birth was pretty standard as far as hydrocephalus goes- 10 hours of labor with an epidural and 1 hour of pushing. The whole experience mostly just involved some additional in depth scans and extra monitoring.", "Feeling disappointed I talked to the neurosurgeon who placed the shunt for my daughter today during her scheduled checkup and was told that she is not a good candidate for ETV/CPC which I have been hoping that it will work and make her shunt-free. Though she is doing fine now, living with the fear that her shunt might act up someday really keeps me up at night. That sucks.", "My Mother Has Hydrocephalus--This may seem insensitive but is honest First off, I love my mother. She has had hydrocephalus since birth and she was part of the \"first generation\" of babies to receive shunts. I became used to hospitals growing up because of all the surgeries she had. She was a great mom in her own way. When I was in kindergarten, she would yell to me in the kitchen how to make a PB&amp;J during the time she was bed ridden. The amount of pain she deals with is amazing. One thing I have been working through is needing to be the \"sickest\" in my house. I am married and have an amazing husband but I have a natural tendency to want to be \"sicker\" than him if we are both dealing with something at the same time. And I know it comes from my mother always downplaying my sickness and needing to be sickest when I was younger. If I had a headache or stomachache or anything, she would let my dad and I know that she was doing worse (which of course she was, she has hydrocephalus and had regular migraines) My dad would allow me to just go to my room and feel bad by myself because my mother needed that attention (which was the best option in the situation I think). It may not have been a big deal but did skew my mentality that if I am not the \"sickest,\" my pain doesnt count. My husband is great and has helped me work through this but it still sometimes comes out-we can joke about it now. I have distance from the situation and I love my parents and I know we all have our idiosyncrasies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion: do any of you with hydrocephalus have a need to be the \"sickest\" or be vocal about your pain when others are expressing theirs even if it is unrelated? No, I have never felt it to be a competition. Honestly there are people who have know me for years who only find out in passing. There was never any need to be the sickest. I was just sick. There was a wish to be normal and the constant worry where today will be the day of something major occurring . That is where a lot of the pain came from. I have found that I have become really aware of how often it is brought up in conversations in my family - even though it is been 29 years since my last revision. \n\nMy sister told mum late last year that \"I could not help her move house because of my hydro\". That was utter crap - I have moved them more times than I care to count!\n\nEven though it does not affect me day-to-day it plays on my mind all the time and weirdly feel like I have to catch myself before I use the s word. Even when my kids point out the scars I would prefer not to tell them what they really are. (Kids are now petrified of feral pigs!)", "Showering for the first time post surgery? A couple nurses gave me instructions but I left still a little confused... it is been 4 days so I am good to shower and I know not to submerge the incision, but can I get it wet at ALL? can water run down it? I am super nervous about causing an infection by showering wrong. It is fine just make sure you wash gently and dry it well right after by gently patting it with a towel and use a hairdryer. Also do not scrub it. As long as you dry it it will be fine. Yea all the stuff above and use baby soap and a clean towel", "Awake in the O.R? For most of the surgeries I have had in my life, I always remember going into the O.R room completely conscious and aware before the doctors give me the anesthesia through the mask. This has led to PTSD and now when I do have surgery, I demand that I get an I.V and the doctors knock me out in pre op. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Yeah that is pretty common. Of the 12 surgeries I have had, 12/12 times I was wheeled back conscious without any relaxers or anything, I moved myself onto the operating table, and then they knocked me out That is how it is for me too. I can only remember one of my revisions from when I was a kid, but I had the same experience - they wheeled me into the OR and then knocked me out.  The rest I have postop amnesia for and have no memory of anything just prior to surgery. I was put out before the OR I have had both. The last one the anesthesiologist was bullshitting with me waiting to go to the operating room and was like \u201cwhelp here is some fentanyl, good night\u201d and that is all I remember. There are studies that look at the endocrine (stress) response to anesthesia that might interest you. ((\n\nEven though it is usually about 30 seconds, the level of stress that you experience as the anesthesia kicks in fully and the memory it imprints can leave you traumatized.\n\nNot only this you are already highly stressed because of what is ahead and the room is just so cold, mechanical, and unfeeling. All the people wearing masks and covered up. I get it. It all comes together in a horrible way.\n\nYou were stressed, then you got drugged with something that seems to elevate your already elevated endocrine response.\n\nI do not know if that helps you at all, but I think asking to get knocked out before is a good idea. They should just do that standard, and then if weirdos like me want to see the inside of the room they can accommodate that.\n\nedit:typo It is a good idea to tell your doctors and ask for sedatives for a few hours before off needed.\nI am sure they will have a way to help you \nAll the best and hugs Interesting to read that some were put under before their surgery. For my dad, they told me he had to be awake before entering the O.R. This would be my dad's second time having surgery and he remembered being very scared the first time. Especially now with COVID going on with no hospital visits, it was harder for him since my mom could not be there to calm him before surgery. I had to trust that the nurses would calm him for us, which they did. I guess everyone is case is different and some need to be awake whereas some can be under before surgery. I have had seven surgeries since my diagnosis. I was a paediatric patient for the the first six surgeries and requested the IV sedative prior to entering the OR,\n\nFor my seventh surgery, I was now in adult care. I was told that they did not have time to give me the sedative as it was an urgent surgery.\n\nI honestly thought that this experience would be traumatizing, but the surgical team were really good at distracting me prior to receiving anesthesia.\n\nHowever, i should mention that it was complete bullshit about how they did not have time to administer a sedative this last surgery, as I had an emergency surgery in the past where you have one hour notice prior to the surgery beginning, and I received a sedative then. I was sedated as a kid, but the last one was when I was 20. I remember even seeing my surgeon and joking with him. I do not remember much after until I woke up in Recovery, but I could see how it can be traumatic.", "Over 50 shunts in one picture! Denver Hydrocephalus Walk 2018.

I was on diamox before my surgery and it gave me the worse side effects I have ever had! I constantly felt like I had the flu, trailing vision, it was awful! \nAnd yes, my neurosurgeon recommend the reservoir because its a easy way for her to check my CFS without a spinal tap, but it is not very common Good luck! Im keeping you in my thoughts and I hope an etv is a good option for you :) I have papilledema too and diamox has saved my life in between these multiple surgeries. I never heard of a reservoir?

Hello, I am a 22 year old male, and my whole life I have experienced uneven pupils, ocular migranes, drainage feeling in my head, thuds in my head, pressure in my head, muscle spams, and drainage out of my eye and ears(more of a sensation), these symptoms seem to come and go , last year around September I had an MRI and my neurologist said everything came back normal, when I went in person he mentioned I had a 9 mm pineal gland cyst, and it was nothing to worry about.

My main goal with joining a sport like this is because I want to improve my fitness, join a club/group of people and because I am not very confident in going to a gym alone so that is why I wanted to join a sport with a group while also developing discipline and improving fitness. \n\nAlso, I have not been able to soeak to my doctor because of COVID but if I decide to go through with this, I plan on speaking to him beforehand.\n\nMy question is has anyone with a shunt/hydrocephalus entered into a contact sport, what has your experience and what information about hydrocephalus did you give to your instructor before beginning in the contact sport.\n\nApologies if this post seems disorganized or is missing any information. :) Yeah I continued to be concerned with it throughout my time there. Our Shihan was very caring and his biggest thing was motiving ourself to our own comfort and gently seeing where we could expand our comfort area. I was upfront with him about my situation and talked with him privately before my first day. He was very in tuned to each persons own abilities and disabilities I guess i would say. \n\nSome places you go will be completely uncomfortable with you saying you have a tube in your head the leads directly to your brain and gives you life. Talking to the instructors or staff before your first day I feel is very important. Get a feel if they seem competent in handling personalized problems.\n\nI thought I had found someone at the university I am attending but after quarantine started I lost contact with her.\n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions or concerns! And I would love to hear if you find a place you like!", "CT scan Parents with hydro babies, how long after a shunt surgery do you start looking into that? My neuro just \u201crecommended\u201d it in a very vague, hand-waiving way.", "I was born with hydrocephalus and had a very good vp shunt placed at birth that is only needed to be replaced once. I am now 30 years old and I had meningitis when I was 6 months old. I am going to ask this without assuming anything, but\u2026 Is there anything that might have slipped my neurosurgeon\u2019s mind to tell my parents about meningitis? Just wondering. That is a vague question. We would have to know exactly what your parents were told, the prognosis for the type of meningitis you had, etc. Also that is banking on the fact that your parents remember what they were told by the neurosurgeon. Go see a neurologist.  A doctors visit should put your worries to bed. \n\nHydrocephalus is usually a symptom for something else.  For me, I have tectal glioma-small tumour blocking fluid from draining.  Two years ago I met with my neurosurgeon and asked him if my shunt is still working or if it is calcified\u2026doctors sat back and said, it is definitely working, otherwise you would not be alive.  \n\nI also asked him if it is ok that I train in Jiu jitsu and he said, it is ok so long as there are no punches or blows to my head.", "Why so many surgeries? My first shunt was installed almost 30 years ago.  Within three years I had 3-4 revisions: my body rejected the shunt,  impact to my head from a car accident and another replacement because I was hurt playing hockey, shunt was not draining and doctors made me sleep on an incline for almost 10 years,\n\nI even went into a coma twice.  \n\nI am a little surprised that  technology has not improved as it seems like new shunts installs in 2019 are still being replaced. Is this true? Two thoughts from my side:\n\n1) Yes, I also hope that somebody could answer your main question, always been wondering this myself. Various treatments for hydrocephalus regarding shunts have been around since the 1960s... \n\n2) You have played hockey even though you have hydrocephalus and a shunt? My daughter has a shunt and the first thing the doctors said was that she was not recommended taking part in e.g. hockey or martial arts due to the obvious risk of shunt failure if she gets hit. Yes..when I was diagnosed at age 9 I would sneak away and play sports with my friends...this drove my parents nuts, however, once I hit my late teens I noticed blows to my head were not resulting in issues related to my shunt, that is when I started activities like beer-league (slow pace) ball hockey and  other activities. &gt; were not resulting in issues related to my shunt\n\nYou were lucky :p Yea.  I had many mri but not one scan showed issues in my brain.   \n\nMy nuro said I could drop in for mri anytime I wanted, so I would go anytime I had a severe headache or blow to my head.   Ended up getting a scan per year,  then around 15 years old we moved to once every 5 years. Replacements definitely still happening. My son has had 3 revisions so far (had one from 3 weeks old, 2018) One failure due to tissue growing into it, one moved out the ventricle and one kinked outside the brain (he has two, they tried to join the two tubes in one port). \n\nSome sort of permanent solution would be nice. It is the worry that is the worst part, every time he is ill it is a potential shunt failure, especially as he is too young to say \u201cI have got one of those headaches\u201d. 8 surgeries in 12 years for me. Shunts never worked permanently in my case, I had one that worked for a few years, then had 5 years of on off revisions. I think they suffer many mechanical and biochemical limitations, and even my neurosurgeons cast a lot of caution on it for this reason. I think the new tech is looking more at ETV where possible (not all cases, I know) because it offers better long term rate of success. Beyond that I do not know where the tech is going but I would love to.\n\nMy hospital did not offer ETV during the past 12 years so I am guessing it is still being rolled out at many mid sized hospitals. It requires some expensive equipment and specialty training so I think that is why. What age were you when the first shunt was put in ? Thanks for the info. 12, so a bit over the usual age for diagnosis. Yea I was 9 years old.  I went partially blind in my right eye due to a benign tumour blocking fluid from draining in one of my ventricles.  \n\nHow is your short term memory?  My memory is terrible, docs think this is due to all the general anesthetic I had to have for each surgery.  I qualified for learning assistance in high school and university, otherwise I would not have made it through.  My short term took a big hit after the ETV but is recovering now ( has been around 4 months since I got the ETV). They said it might drop in the first few months though so I am not concerned, and it has gotten better. I was at least able to return to my masters degree and complete coursework over the same summer, so it did recover quite fast. \n\nI had a few endocrine issues from what I can tell as well but that was again to be expected. Mostly salt control in my body, and I could tell that just from when I returned to exercise via light walking a few weeks later. Nice work.  Not letting this dam thing hold you back is the trick.  \n\nI train in jiu jitsu..I have not been in anything physical for almost 30years..now I get choked out weekly..so much fun.  Really, it just feels great to get hands on  and toss people.. Absolutely, you have to jump back in. I am a runner and I still cannot quite get the same speeds I had in May, but I am back to 40 km/week and training smarter. After a while you forget about it, which is particularly easy for me now not having a shunt for the first time in 12 years. Yea I struggled with the trauma of not knowing when the next revision could come.  I lived a reckless life until I met my wife.  \n\nI always had good morals but usually chose risk over caution in every day life decisions because I always felt I could wake up in a hospital the next day, dealing with yet another shunt revision.  My wife helped me get diagnosed with anxiety and now I am 50% better. Good to hear. It is a tough illness but I am glad we can both say we are on the good side of it for now. Shunts still fail due to their simple nature in design. It is literally a tube draining fluid. There is so many different variables that can cause the shunt to fail. There has been some research in the betterment of the design and the last I saw was a design on a shunt that had a \u201cflush\u201d system in place that a healthcare provider could press and possibly flush out the obstruction in the shunt.  I would sign up for a flush.", "Shunt revision last month, but I am still having headaches, anyone relate? I had a vp revision last month (4 weeks almost) and for a week after my surgery my headache disappeared for the first time in 4 years. I had a blockage in the catheter that goes into my brain, but my scans looked normal so for all that time they thought I was fine. Eventually they did surgery and found that the catheter was indeed blocked and replaced it and the valve that was not really working. I have a strata valve and have tried settings 5 4 and now I am on 3 and they have gotten a bit worse. No other symptoms and they did a bunch of tests to rule out infection because I was worried. I am so upset that my headache disappeared for only a week. I am hoping they just need to go to maybe a higher setting but I am feeling low on hope. Anyone deal with anything similar? Try drinking a little more water when you wake up in the morning.  It takes a while for the body to adapt to new flow rate of csf fluid post revision. \n\nMy last revision was 3 years ago.  Still get headaches occasionally. Make sure pee is clear.  \nAnother thing that affects headaches is how much salt and potassium I ingest. Too much salt= headache.

I know it can be different for everyone but how was your recovery?  How long did it take for you to feel normal?  If you are willing to share and have photos, what did your incisions look like? I got mine at 28 a little over 3 years ago and honestly the recovery I was given from work was a month but I felt relatively good after a week and outside of a constant dull headache for another week I was alright. You will feel fuzzy for awhile similar to the fuzzy ness of a hangover just not as intense. I know going in can be nerve wracking I was scared shitless but the release after made it all worth it in the end I promise you that you will feel so much better! As for the scar it is not too bad it looks like a small shark took a chomp lol it is the best explanation but since my hair grew back you cannot even see it! Good luck and have a speedy recovery! If you ever want to talk of want any insight fee free to shoot me a dm! That is great to hear!  Thank you so much!  My surgeon has told me to plan for 6 weeks but I feel like that is an eternity off work lol My dad (64 years old) got his VP shunt in February. It took him a while to recover (I would assume because of his age and other health conditions). But the day after surgery, he was walking straight again whereas before he had balance issues and was dragging his feet. He had 3 incisions, the head, neck, and stomach. They looked long but it all healed nicely. His hair grew back quickly so you cannot even see the scar. My dad has a brain tumor so his memory is still a bit cloudy. He used to have problems making it to the washroom on time but that has not been an issue since the surgery. I have seen a huge improvement in my dad since then and he is so thankful he had the surgery. Hope everything goes well for you! \u2764\ufe0f &gt;As for the scar it is not too bad it looks like a small shark took a chomp lol\n\nThis is a good explanation! Now when I think back to looking at my dad's scar, it does look like that, hehe.  Is this your first shunt surgery or have you lived with one for a long time? For me, having had 30 shunt revisions, I am usually feeling normal around 3 weeks after surgery. After that point, I really only feel different if I look in the mirror and see my incisions and see the sutures sticking out. I have had 7 VP shunt surgeries. 5 as a kid and 2 as an adult in 2016. My surgery in August 2016 had me recovering for a month. The second surgery in December 2016 had me out for 2 months. In my case, some other stuff happened before, during and after the surgeries in 2016 so I cannot tell you how long it took to feel normal as in my case, I will never be the same again. (Not typical do not worry) I have 2 post op pics of my incisions somewhere on this hydrocephalus Reddit. ( First surgery ever other than tonsillectomy.  I am a ball of nerves. For me, I look forward to the surgeries. I know that the recovery is going to suck, but I know I am going to feel so much better after the surgery. I know it is not going to help, but just take a breath and take your days after surgery, one day at a time and do not rush to get back to normal. It is going to take time. I have had 2 shunt revisions in my life (am almost 17 years old), and I spent about one day in the hospital directly after my second vp shunt revision, then took about three weeks to fully regain normal activities (mostly the pain from my incision sites was holding me back). My head incision looked almost identical to the picture another redditor had shared on this thread, and I had to apply antibiotic cream to the incision sites for about two weeks post-surgery. Hopefully my information helps and I wish you a successful surgery and recovery! Helpful info indeed.  Thank you!! I know it feels like an eternity but relax and focus on getting back to normal! It is always better to have more time and not need it than too little! Also, thank my 7 year old nephew for that one lol when he came to see me at the hospital he asked me \u201cif they got the shark\u201d lol and it stuck I will take a look.  Thank you! Just stopping by to say that I am 5 days postop and feeling fine.  I feel much better now than I have felt in the last year!  Still a lot of recovery obviously but zero regrets. Thanks everyone!  Just came to share that the surgery went well and I am feeling great! So happy to hear that!! I was born 23 weeks premature with Hydrocephalus. Long story short, I had a scare in 2017-2018. I was manic, neuropsychiatric symptoms, misdiagnosed by the Mayo Clinic with Encephalitis. Thanks to the University of Minnesota, I had to have my shunt replaced (with a VP) because it was over draining. July 9th, 2018 I woke up that morning back to normal.\n\nI bounced back quite fast, but I am now 21 and somehow still feel that I am recovering to this day in some ways\u2026", "Reservoir pain tips So I have had pain in my etv reservoir basically nonstop for the past two weeks.

I am trying to help a 14 year old I am mentoring, and I want to compare a few things. When you say sensory problems, are you talking like vision problems and things like that? I do have a visual impairment, but I am not totally blind. I am considered as \u201clow vision\u201d. I am talking about all 5 senses. For me it is mostly sound, and touch. I am still trying to figure my mentee out still. But he has tics, chews on his chapped lips when chapstick is not available, and has a \"brain overload\" at school mid day resulting in falling asleep in class. I am autistic (dx\u2019ed aspergers in 06) When you were in school would you crash in the middle of school during a specific class? Crash meaning sleep? If so it was usually history classes and life sciences Yes. It is always in a specific class for him. Hmm. I do not have SPD, but I definitely do the lip thing and have other tiny, basically unnoticeable to other people tics.\n\nI do not have active hydrocephalus (obstruction fixed by surgery), but essentially the \u201cdamage\u201d is done. I do not know if my little idiosyncrasies are related at all but he is not alone.\n\nAnd I would find myself unable to focus to the point of nearly falling asleep in math classes, but I do not know if it was just because I found math incredibly boring. It got better in college. When he falls asleep there is a staff member that tries to wake up, but he cannot still seem to stay awake no matter how he tries. With him it is him not being able to stay up during class, like crashing. I have similarities to it, and he is never been diagonosed with it either, which makes me wonder if his teachers have ever noticed his tics. For me I hate being touched (he does too), and I have sensitivity to some noises. Also are you familiar with barometric pressure headaches by chance? Yup. Although I think even people without hydro get them a bunch I do not get them. But the kid had a couple a few days apart where he could feel something pressing against the back of his eye, and it would make his vision blurry in that eye for a bit. He also described the first one as the worst headache he is ever had. He is had the same shunt since he was a newborn, and he is 14. That does not sound like just a normal pressure headache \u2014 I would encourage him to see his neurosurgeon or at least his pcp, sounds like something is up &amp; better safe than sorry He will be soon. Since he is a minor his folks has to set up the appointment.", "Do you feel ashamed for your hydrocephalus? I cannot explain why but to be honest i always feel ashamed for having hydrocephalus, even against doctors / neurosurgeons / nursing staff. For example when they see mri images of my brain, know about my shunt etc...\n\nIt may have to do with my experience that some neurosurgeons think about hydrocephalus in a way like \"well, why do you complain, its just hydrocephalus, you will get a shunt, that is an easy surgery, and then you are done\". But of course many of us know that its often not like this.\n\nSo i wonder if others think the same way? Do not feel ashamed!  Many people have some medical thing their dealing with, you are not alone.  Absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about.  Completely out of your control.  Xoxo The frequent headaches and mental fog drive me nuts.  I almost cannot live a normal life.  It is also caused me to be visually impaired so cannot drive either.  Employability is questionable.  It is really hard to find a job that I can do to a satisfactory level that also pays for a roof over my head.  I am not ashamed just frustrated. I do not think neurosurgeons think about hydrocephalus as a \u201cdo not complain\u201d thing as much as a shunt placement is very common and routine to them. They are super comfortable with them. Their confidence is meant to relax. \n\nAs the parent of a kid with hydrocephalus I have an interesting perspective and view. When around seemingly healthy infants and kids I felt that my kid would have such a hard route to take. On the other side I have spent time at Children\u2019s hospitals, specialists, neurologists and radiologists and seen kids that will require very intensive intervention and I have been very thankful for my child\u2019s health. Perspective is what you make it. For whatever you feel ashamed of you can also feel accomplishment for overcoming hardships. You cannot be brave without being scared. Whichever side we choose to feel and embrace is up to the individual. I do not feel ashamed at all to have it. I know it is a miracle I am even alive considering everything that I have been through (and not only me) but I do feel frustrated sometimes that my life has not been as easy as a \"normal\" person. But I am lucky and thankful to be able to be mostly normal and functional, everything considered. ", "Sleeping with a Certas valve I (21M) had a shunt revision a few weeks ago to deal with a sudden failure of a Medos valve I would had in for 11 years. The valve before that had been initially implanted when I was a few days old, so they saw fit to replace the whole system. Anyways, it is been about two and a half weeks. My incisions are healing just fine and I am making a slow, steady recovery, but sleeping is still uncomfortable. With the old valve, it was just a small bump on the right side of the back of my head that gave me no trouble. But this new valve is larger, and the area is still sore, so I have been sleeping in different positions to try to take the weight off. This has the unfortunate side effect of messing up my left shoulder to the point where my shoulder often hurts more than my abdomen or my head. Any suggestions to make things more comfortable? Will it just get better with time as things continue healing? Get yourself a nursing pillow for babies. They are called Boppy pillows. They are a half moon type pillow. It is easier to sleep on as you can position your shunt in the middle and not have pressure put on it. It gets better. It took almost 6 months for me to be able to sleep halfway decently.  my newest shunt was installed in 2003. it still drives me nuts (it is in the back, right, upper quadrant. placed in such a way that laying on my back or right side puts the weight of my skull directly onto it.)    I had a complete shunt revision a few months ago.  After living for over fifty years with the shunt on my right side, it is now on the left.  I sleep on my left side.  The Sheex Side Sleeper pillow is working well.  It is a down-alternative that is very pliable. The pillow molds around the shunt rather than pressing against it.   Good luck &amp; sweet dreams.", "Can a VP shunt be extended? Also, any weight lifters here? Hey folks, this has been nagging at me for a while and I figure it will only keep getting worse, going to book an appointment with my neuro on Monday but it can take quite a while to get appointments (big waiting list) so just thought I would look for some advice here as well.\n\nI have two VP shunts. The first was inserted during infancy on my right hand side, and failed when I was 17, in 2006. They did not feel comfortable mucking around with it given how long it had been embedded in my body so they instead simply installed a new one on my left side.\n\nSituation now is that I have got into bodybuilding and weight lifting since them. And especially over the last several months since I have been doing some serious poundage on the dumbbell bench press (targets the pecs by squeezing them together), I am becoming more and more \"aware\" of the old, defunct shunt. It is not *painful* per se, it is just becoming very \"present\" and quite uncomfortable. When I lie on my side, I can feel the neck portion being stretched from my pec muscle and this aches a bit. \n\nObviously being as paranoid as many in the internet age I am haunted by visions of the older shunt one day snapping, with who knows what consequences, or either one of them slipping off my collar bone and into the hollow between the collar bones (this probably has a name?) - I do not know how founded or unfounded these fears are, but I would be very happy if there was a way to extend the shunt tubing so both shunts have more room to stretch out as my muscles keep developing. Lifting has given me a huge amount of confidence and I am determined not to give it up unless I exhaust every possibility of making bulking up compatible with having a shunt, so really just looking for some advice as to what can be done and what should be done.\n\nAny insights?", "This is a blog post I wrote today after a experience my mentee described to me that promoted me to write the post after I realized what happened.

Tea would be a great idea though. I need to get back into that stuff :) I have had a huge amount of insomnia since having my hydrocephalus \"cured\". No trouble falling asleep though, just staying asleep. I have tried setting myself a pretty hard routine which has helped a bit. Particularly with having a set time that I exercise.

No, it is just general anxiety for me ( basically just worrying about stupid stuff and over thinking . 98% of the time I do not even notice my shunt.", "In the process of being diagnosed with hydrocephalus\u2014advice needed. Went to ENT yesterday and she confirmed multiple csf leaks from my brain to the mastoid air cells within the temporal bone on both sides and I to both ears. Next step is neurologist consult to test for pressure in my brain as they believe the cause for my leaks is hydrocephaly and need to get the high pressure under control which they believe they will be able to do with medicine. If that medicine does not work, they will put in a shunt to help relieve the extra pressure. I also need to get an MRI and she thinks there might be part of my brain tissue exposed through the fracture sites.\n\n\nBecause I am in the process of a diagnosis of hydrocephalus, is there anything that I should or should not do? Also for those of you who have had this diagnosis, is it likely I will get the shunt placed in or has anyone successfully managed it with medication. The medication they are considering is Diamox, but because it is in the sulfa family, I cannot take it (allergy). Any advice? Regarding the shunt, if you get to have one placed, chances of complications, what you should or should not do, etc. will WILDLY vary from person to person.\n\nTo give you some perspective, I never had mine replaced in 36 years, never had any issues with coordination, no physical or mental drawbacks whatsoever, I lift weights, I do indoor bouldering (rock climbing but in a gym) and I am a classically trained guitarist... while on the other hand of the spectrum there are people with 20+ surgeries in their counter who have trouble riding a bicycle or with fine motor skills.

Made a ton of progress then in September, I had an emergency appendectomy and my health had basically deteriorated since then. Had to stop lifting for a while.

There really is not any advice anyone can give you because it varies wildly from person to person. Me personally, I have had a shunt since shortly after birth and I am 29 years old. I am recovering right now from my 29th shunt revision. Good luck in your journey!! 29th? Ouch. I never had one so I am not even sure of how the process is. How long do you stay in the hospital? How do you know it is time to go to the ER? I actually work at the hospital where my surgeon works and I also work in surgery. I told him that I did not want to go to the emergency room, so he sent me to have a rapid sequence MRI and chest X-ray. After those were over, I got a call with what room number I was in. Walked up to my room, changed into a gown and was having surgery four hours later. I went home the next day. So I am WAY out of the normal when it comes to that. I have however had to go to the emergency room all of the other times I have had a revision. The only symptoms I show for shunt failure is a headache that will not be treated with any pain medication along with light sensitivity. I actually try to take some medicine to treat the headache and if I am at home, try to take a nap. When I wake up and the headache is gone, then I know it is not the shunt. I have gone two or three days with a headache just out of hardheadedness until it gets where I cannot stand the pain. It is 100% not what you are supposed to do but it is what I do. Diamox is not for long term use. There is no medicine for hydro at the moment. But they are working on it. Who knows in 10+years. You will need to see a neurosurgeon. They deal with shunts.  You should forget the medication because they have very serious side effects...\u00edve already tried...not good...not at all. \u2639\ufe0f Thing is... How do you know if it is just a headache or time to run when you do not have any way to compare? I assume it is a really intense and overwhelming ache? Personally when I present with a shunt failure, the headache will be right behind my eyes and across my forehead and at my temples.  I know it is not possible but it feels like my eyes could literally pop out of their sockets. I have gone to the ER once before and I was given IV fluids and it was ruled a migraine. So now I have to decide whether it is a migraine or shunt failure. This is the reason why I will wait days before going to the hospital to seek some relief.  If I am in really bad shape with a headache and enlarged ventricles, my neurosurgeon will come into my room in the ER to tap the shunt and draw some fluid off, which gives me immediate relief from the headache usually long enough to get me to surgery. You literally described my headaches that I get from time to time. Are you familiar with the Hydrocephalus Association? They have always been a great resource for information. They also have a peer support group if you want to speak with someone who may have been in the same situation. ( Lakisha is also a great resource.   I would recommend not going down the medicinal route, it will only mask the symptoms not cure them which may lead to even bigger problems later.", "How many CT scans is too many? How many have you had? I am 26, female, and I was diagnosed with idiopathic hydrocephalus a little more than a year ago.  I have a VP shunt.\n\nThroughout this time ive probably had 15+ CT scans.  If my head starts hurting and I call my NS, he will usually say just go to the ER.  I would like to get an MRI but the ER pushes the CT scan.  I am starting to become worried about having so many scans and all the radiation.\n\nHow worried should I be about having too many CT scans?  I know most people with hydrocephalus have had it since birth so many have probably had more than me.  How many have you guys had?  Should I always push for an MRI no matter what even if that means having to wait for a few weeks to get one?\n\n Okay so here is a really tricky subject. Getting MRI\u2019s in the ED is incredibly difficult. I mean, you generally have to be having some acute neurological deficits for docs to successfully order an MRI over a CT (for example, incontinence or unexplained focal weakness (one side of your body) ) Even then, a CT is still going to be way easier to order. The reason for this is time obviously, MRIs are supper expensive and take time, anywayyyyyyyss just saying this so you understand why docs push CT scans.\n\nSecond, with hydrocephalus, your ventricles are going to swell the fuck up which is super easy to recognize on a CT. (There are other ways to recognize easily on CT as well). This is another reason why they love it. An MRI gives a much more extensive look at soft tissue and thus is not the primary test. In life, it is generally best to take the simplest route right? No need to over complicate. \n\nThis brings us to your original question, and you are not going to like the answer. The answer is, nobody knows exactly how much is too much, but less is better, especially for young people. The problem is that radiation in CT scans is pretty damn significant. For grandma, who only has 10 years left anyways, it is not a big deal, as genetic mutations (cancer causing shit) take time. For you and I, less radiation is better. Radiating part of your body (especially vital areas like brain, chest and abdomen) is dangerous. \n\nThe problem is, ER physicians/neurologists have to cover their ass. When you call saying you are having a headache, you do not really give them much choice but to order emergent imaging. They need to make sure nothing emergent is going on. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is a trade. If you are concerned it could be life threatening/a shunt malfunction, you just need to bite the bullet and get the scan. You can definitely try holding out for an MRI, but all the docs I work with in VA beach would basically say \u201csorry, CT or nothing\u201d. I know it is super frustrating, but that is just where medicine is at. \n\nOne more little tip, never lose your cool and always try to be nice to your doc/PA/NP. Instead of saying \u201cabsolutely not, I will just wait for an MRI or nothing.\u201d Try explaining, \u201clook, I know you guys deal with this stuff all the time and I swear I am not trying to be difficult. I have just had so much radiation on my brain already and I am so young. Is there any possible way I could get and MRI instead\u201d. ER docs deal with so many entitled ass holes 24/7 that anger and frustration NEVER work on them. Genuine kindness/humbleness is all that works. Trust me.  \n\nObligatory disclaimer: I know nothing, I am just a hydrocephalus buddy trying to help. Take everything I say with a grain of salt. If you have any concerns, contact your doctor, call 911 or go to a hospital.  Wow, thank you so much for such a long and thoughtful response.  It was very helpful.  \n\nHow many scans have you had? I want to say like 4 I think. Not entirely sure but it is not a lot. Initial diagnosis and after shunt placement and revision I think are the only CT\u2019s I have had. I get headaches and shit from time to time, but I ignore mild headaches that do not persist. Everybody is different though. If you have any concerns, you still got to get medical attention.  I have not had enough. \n\nI am terrified there is fluid on my brain, and I am scared my Doctor is not moving fast enough on it. \n\nThe last one I had was in 2008, I think. Do not quote me on that because I am not precisely sure. \n\nIt was a long time ago. Too long. \n\nI am hoping there is nothing wrong, but...  I am 41 and I have had over 90 CT's (and 2 EMI Scans!) during my journey with hydrocephalus. I honestly do not think you have anything to worry about. I have had at least 10 in my memory since I have never had any problems and I am 25. I got my shunt when I was 18 months old. I remember getting one at 3 and 5, but nothing before then. (Since I am sure I got some before and after my shunt was put in at a year old) Then I got one in 3rd grade at 9 years old. Then for some reason I got 7 between 6th and 12th grade. (I think they were wondering if my shunt would break when I grew) Then I had a 5 year checkup 2 years ago. (I was kind of upset since my dad said it was just going to be a \"checkup\" and I did not think I would need a CT scan since I was not having problems. For the same reason this thread was made....meaning that I did not want radiation) I think it was because I was meeting a new Neurosurgeon as my other one passed away a few years between appointments. I may need one again this year, since I moved away the week after that appointment and I probably should be getting a new NS since I have lived away from my other one for 2 years. I imagine that when I meet my new NS they will probably order another CT scan, which I am not looking forward to.", "Hydrocephalus Survey for New Hydro Website Hey everyone! \n\nI have perused this sub for a few years now, and your stories have always been shocking, fascinating, inspiring... all of the above. \n\nI am creating a website for hydrocephalus and have created a survey I need feedback on. I believe that our complex hydro stories of (often) repeated brain surgeries can help build a network of stories and tools to help people heal. \n\n  \n\nAbout me: I have 20+ years experience with hydrocephalus ;), have had double digit neurological surgeries, ran a large hydrocephalus support group in LA a few years ago, hosted a 5K walk... I recently started the group up again virtually during Covid (message me if you would like to join!). I am looking to expand beyond the support group structure and would love \"open-source\" feedback -- individual experience to help design group feedback.\n\nPlease take my survey, with no advertising, just questions regarding you or your child's journey with hydrocephalus. It is less than 5 minutes and helps us design a platform that will serve the people struggling with the fallout from hydrocephalus.   \n\nThanks! Is it cool with you if I share this elsewhere, or do you want it to be a Reddit only thing? Hi vikingfrog, I would love it if you shared this elsewhere!! I am just trying to reach hydro people wherever they are. Thanks! Filled it out! Thanks toaster\\_face! Greatly appreciate it. Have you found any resources similar to this available near you? Yes, yes, and yes please. I have filled out the survey, and this website sounds like a dream come true in some respects. Just finished filling it out as well.\n\nI will make a couple of people that I know who have Hydrocephalus aware of this survey for a new Hydro Website.", "shunt malfunction protocol? TL;DR at the end\n\nhi! \ni had a shunt placement in october 2019 for hydrocephalus that i developed after a tumor removal. i have been having constant issues since the placement. no relief of headaches, side cramping, middle of my chest feels like it is going to crack in half/pops when stretching, severe shoulder pain, feeling like i am breathing in shards of glass, etc. i have met with my neuro team and they suspect my tubing is too long and may need to shorten it. i have to meet with an OBGYN, ENT and Endo before the surgery and 2 of the 3 i have been able to see and have cleared me on their end. i also have other neuro issues going on which may contribute to the ongoing headaches, but over the past week my headache has been more of a pressure feeling. like i swam to the bottom of the swimming pool. my neurologist started me on Aimovig, and i am on my second month of the 140 injection with no improvements. i am waiting to hear back from my neurosurgeon but i was wondering what is the specific protocol for malfunction? previously with the same symptoms, i was admitted into the ER where they ran a CT, X-rays, lumbar puncture and flipped me upside down on a table to see if anything was leaking. for every suspected malfunction, is it an immediate admittance to the ER? i am in the US. thank you in advance! \n\nTL;DR : what is the typical protocol for suspected shunt malfunction? is it an immediate ER room visit, or is this something my doctor would order labs on and i would have an appointment for labs or something? TIA.", "VP shunt. Can you see your tube in your chest? I have had a VP shunt in since I was 6 months old, I am now 16. I can see my tube in my chest, not the actual tube but where it raises the skin it is perfectly outlined. I do not know if that makes sense but it weirds me out lol I mostly just see mine towards the top of my chest.  I have always enjoyed flexing my neck and freaking people out because of how visible it made the tubing. I can too lol my neuro just said it is because I am skinny lol I see mine in my neck only Yes. It is more visible now because it is corroded though. My mentee's is visible through his chest. But he is also 5'3\" with his leg braces on and around 90-95 pounds. I can only see it where my neck bone is, once it hits my chest area I no longer can. I am 5\u20190 115-120lbs Anyone feel like joining together to put up an album? Just photos from the neck down, anonymously.\n\nIt would be super reassuring particularly for teens. I have not been a teen in 18 years and it is still a major \"trauma\" how much visible mine is.

TIA ", "time to scan - having major shunt malfunction symptoms ", "Just making sure it is not just me Anyone else hear their shunt inside their head working it is magic? When I get headaches I can often hear the sort of noises you would hear from literal water around the brain being squeezed through (what is for me) the right rear end of my head to my neck. Does anyone else hear noises or is just me? It is not just you. \nWhen I wake up in the morning, I roll onto my right side, which is the side that my shunt is located on, and sit up slowly and can hear what sounds almost like sands in an hour glass.\nI did not know what it was the first time I heard it, but then it became a very comforting thing to hear each morning. Before my shunt malfunctioned and was replaced in 2017, that is a sound I had never heard. So for me, it is very reassuring :-) I have had shunts since I was 1 and the last time I got mine replaced (and moved to a different spot in my head) was in 2012. I only just told my mum that I can hear my shunt and she was pretty shocked, which is why I am so curious, because either the doctors I had back in 2012 (when I was 8) just did not tell her or even they did not know it would make noise I am 48 years old and my shunt malfunctioned in 2017. Prior to that it malfunctioned when I was a very young child. I was born with hydrocephalus and it was initially placed when I was only 28 days old. So, my entire life, up until 2017, I never heard it. But I learned in 2017 that my shunt had been malfunctioning for decades! So, for me, it is a very reassuring and positive thing. Plus, is not it sort of cool to have something like that, that we experience that very few others can understand? That may seem weird, but it helps me to accept it. LOL Eh generally just a reminder to me that I have a plastic tube suckling brain fluid from my brain. LOL That too. I honestly thought I was just hearing things. Mine would sound like the faucet was running and making a spurting sound. I have a LP shunt, and it is been malfunctioning since 2018. I just realized that I have not been hearing that sound anymore \ud83e\udd14 Sometimes it keeps me up at night. I have only been able to hear it since I got a programmable shunt in 2010. Prior to that I had a non-programmable one and I never heard it. I have never heard mine working normally but there was this one time where I heard it unclog itself? I think. There was this weird popping noise. I hear it sort if jostling around when I run though. Absolutely. There is a bit of me very reassured when I do hear it.\nMust admit I hear it more if I have a headache, or I think sometimes if I am a bit dehydrated", "I captured one minute of my pain experience and added sound to it, this was the result. it is rough.

He was born 4 months early, had a bilateral grade 4 IVH, and lost his left lobe. Eventually he developed hydro and had a VP Magnetic shunt placed. He is now 18 months old, cannot use his right extremities, and as you can imagine we have every specialist and therapist known to man. If you know anything about CIMT, you know exactly how excruciatingly hard it is to convince everyone that your son is a good candidate and CAN handle that intensive of a therapy. I would received the referral 4 months ago, and I was happy. But I knew the battle was far from over. I have spent 4 months fighting tooth and nail, arguing with doctors that my son NEEDS this therapy, how will he ever sit, walk, run or play without use of his right extremities? No, he does not need once/twice a week for 1 hour, what is the point? We could do that in OT, we are there exactly that often for OT. He had his evaluation today, and boy did he show that CIMT specialist. He showed her how determined he is, how hard he works, and that he really wants to just be able to get up and go. He got accepted, she submitted the forms before we even left the evaluation room. We will be there 3 days a week for 2-2 1/2 hours. And I am just so proud of my son. So proud of me. I AM a strong enough advocate for my son. I AM doing everything in my power to help him reach his full potential. I AM enough. I am so glad that your kid has you! Holy crap, pardon my French, but you are a badass parent and you are amazing! Awesome victory. As if taking care of our kids that have had a hard road is not hard enough, the bureaucracy of treatment is so draining. It always makes my family feel very isolated and uncared for. That is so exciting to get accepted into a good therapy group. You cannot teach motivation and him being a stubborn fighter is going to be huge for his progress and give you a nice wave of positivity to ride on! I feel like this is a stupid question but what do you mean \u2018lost\u2019 his left lobe? I had a unilateral grade 4 IVH so I am interested :) Thank you. He put in twice the work I did, though. (: Yes! HE did this! All I did was argue, he proved my point for me. I am slowly figuring out how to manipulate and sway his specialists my way. It is sad that I have to come to those tactics, but I will always play the game better than them for my son. No worries! Somehow his right lobe came out of the bleed almost unscathed, his white matter is almost perfect. However, when you have a super large amount of blood like that sitting on the brain for an extended period of time (waiting for it to re-absorb) there is a good chance of brain matter underneath dying. He recieved weekly mri\u2019s until about 3 1/2 months in the NICU, to which after all the brain loss and blood had mostly cleared up we could see the full extent of deterioration. So does he essentially have half a brain? Does it appear that way on MRI\u2019s? Yes. MRIs appear that he has really an unremarkable amount of brain matter in the left lobe, but what is there is healthy, so they would decided to leave it.", "In uci after my first revision Not sure what else to say.

Sometimes we know our pain best. Then the trigger stuff.\n\nBefore my second shunt I went six months of being really sick with sevear headaches every couple of days. I could not turn my head without pain where the tube enters my skull, sometimes I had to be really careful even walking or riding my bike even when I was 'well' because jolting the shunt hurt. I lost loads of weight cause like nearly half the days I could not keep stuff down. Turns out the shunt had slipped far out of place and the lower pipe was perished. Cause we could feel where the valve was my dad, an engineer, theorised the shunt had slipped and was pulling on scar tissue. The surgeon said shunts do not do that before the surgery and after returned and said no that theory was probably correct. I commend the honesty but it just shows know one knows everything, it may be their specialty but its our pain and it is a peice of engineering invented by a plumber.\n\n It was not until post surgery that I realised that I could not remember the last time I had not had a headache\n\nTrigger now\n\ntowards the end of those six months every time I was 'better' I thought if I get sick again I am going to end it because I cannot do this any more. Then when I got sick I did not want to cause myself more pain and also could not be bothered to do it when I could barely balance on my feet so I did not and when I got 'better' I hoped it would not happen again. So that became a cycle. \n\nNow when I get headaches I become incredibly anxous which leads to worse headache. It does not help that I am now not allowed to be sick or my dad gets anxous/angry that im getting like THAT again which only makes me think about it more. Recently I have had a fair few headaches which I am sure are nothing. But I had a seizure (no prior history) after two days of sevear headaches which I think is related more to the anxiety and night shift than the hydro but it adds stress anyway. The problem is my resolve is not as strong as it was at the start of those six months and I do not think it would take as long as it did to get me back into that mindset. I do not even know what I am asking just wanting to get that off my chest really. Hi I have hydro and have so far only needed a ETV bur hole for drainage, What has happened you you is a reason I am scared to even get a shunt. \nI cannot imagine how difficult it was for you but do know how it feels to want to give up, from suffer from extreme anxiety some of it due to traumatic childhood and some because of brain damage from 20 years misdiagnosed hydro. \nI have found I am in a cycle when all I focus on is my health, every cough, headache or rash and I am worried and looking up google, I record everything in a diary just in case it is the start of a new disease.\nI have headaches most days but thankfully pills are helping, I hate having to wait for specialist appointments, if I got to my family doctor I get no help and the hospital will not take me seriously unless I am half dead. \nI hope your pain is managed and in time your anxiety can reduce, I do not think there is ever a quick cure, perhaps see some one about how you are feeling, what you are going through is understandable, you will find you are so much stronger than others who have never had a chronic illness. You got this Your dad gets anxious/angry because he is terrified of losing you and may not know any other way of expressing it. Hydro is scary for us parents too, though my son is far too young for me to know how it affects him. He is currently in the hospital needing a new reservoir. Talk to your dad about it, you both will learn something. As for the headaches, I wish i could give you uplifting words, but to me the best thing is to find something that can take your mind off it. When my son had headaches (I could tell by the way he grabbed at his head) heavy metal (most certainly not for everyone) seemed to calm him the best. 6 months is a long time to be sick like that, that is really tough and I am sorry. I want you to know you are not alone. I got my first shunt this year and already had 4 or 5 adjustments, every headache and migraine triggers a spiral into depression and anxiety. I worry about if my shunt needs adjusting again or if it is failing, and often get pain where it goes into my skull and worry about what could be causing that. What helped me a little was talking to the nurse practitioner who treats my hydrocephalus and hearing from her that these pains are expected. Though I can see it might not be as simple for you because your doctor did not believe anything was wrong and your fears about the shunt moving were proven true. I am sorry I do not have advice but I do hope that things get better for you and that your doctor learned a lesson from this experience you had, and will listen to you better from now on. medicinal cannabis may help", "Overdraining shunt relief without surgery? Hi folks\n\nI have hydrocephalus following a haemorrhage at birth 27 years ago. My most recent revisions last year were kind of traumatic. 3 revisions in 8 days followed by the suggestion to drink 2-3 litres of fluid a day plus caffeine, as my shunt was now at too low a pressure but the neuro team could not fix it anymore. My brain does not get on with the higher pressure valve apparently. \n\nSo that was August last year. I am now at a point where I am struggling cognitively (I have SLT and OT input) and I am getting headaches most days. Pulsing headaches, back pain, feeling of 'pulling' down my spine, vision loss, ringing in my ears. My consultant does not think any further surgery is worth doing but also does not think there is much evidence for the water/caffeine advice. He says people with shunts just get headaches. So what am I supposed to do? \n\nI am aiming to get back to full time work and that is not compatible with spending a good chunk of the afternoon lying flat, with my head feeling like it will explode. I also do not know if my current coping mechanism is a reasonable workplace adjustment (a cup of tea, some crisps and lying flat for 10 minutes). 'sounds fake but ok, whatever.'\n\nI am not suitable for an ETV, and a programmable shunt is too risky. Does anyone else have any other strategies for helping with overdraining? I do not 'want' surgery, I just want to not be in pain.\n\nThanks! I had (still have, to some degree) overdrainage for nearly 10 years. The only thing that worked for me was caffeine. Lots of it. \n\nI would love to know why programmable shunts are too risky? Do not get me wrong, I have not had the best experience with them, but having to play with settings to find the right-ish setting is better than constant overdrainage. Does your Neuro realise that chronic overdrainage comes with its own risks? The last shunt op I had was a tricky one apparently, everything was stuck with adhesions. Neuro is worried that the another go would push things too far and I would have a stroke. Due to Covid, non-emergency appointments have about a year waiting list.\n\nI have a healthcare background and I have read the medical literature. Myelopathy and haemorrhage do not sound great but I will have to take my chances.\n\nCaffeine is working well for me - I made a big batch of cold brew the other day and I am working through that. \n\nHave you heard about high salt intake helping? I have been reading about high fluid intake, caffeine and salt being effective. Thank you for your informative response! Yeah, previous complications can make treatment difficult! I had a bunch of revisions close together, which is why my current shunt has not been replaced and I have had Slit Ventricle Syndrome for so long. Surgeon was reluctant to go in again.\n\nI drink anywhere between 5 and 9 cups of coffee on a regular day. Record was about 19 servings in a day. I would not recommend that most people go that high, but it helped in the moment.\n\nI have not heard anything about salt, but I am on a high salt diet anyway so I would not have noticed much of an impact from that I do not imagine. If you have found some evidence that it helps, it might be worth a shot. It sucks that we have to wing it so much with finding what works.", "I had my 4th VP shunt revision!!! It went really well and quick. The hydrocephalus really came back to bite me in the ass, the symptoms came in three hours right on the night of my first show when I was doing tech for costumes and makeup. Which was super unfortunate but I shoulda known since its been five years from my first revision.  Ironically the theme for this years prom was Tangled, lol.\n\n Glad your surgery went well! I just had my first revision a month ago. Do your symptoms (headaches) take awhile to go away after the surgery or are they pretty much gone right afterwards? I had been having daily headaches for the past 9 months, so my neuro suggested a shunt revision to see if that corrected the headaches, bit so far my headaches have not gone away. I was hoping that it would just take some time for my head to heal from the revision but I am starting to think it may be related to something else. Glad to hear.  I had three shunt revisions, followed by an ETV surgery over the past 12 years, so I get the feeling.  Glad you are doing better! glad it went well! I know those scars oh too well! For anyone afraid of a shunt revision do not forget they are common. I had one every year when i was 1-5 years old. Mine went away almost immediately, I think the same symptoms youre having happened to me in my third revision. My neuro told me that they had replaced the shunt with the type that I was with before but we soon discovered that I needed a VP shunt with a higher flow to accomadate the valve. they soon replaced the old type with a electromagnetic valve and i felt the same relief i had with this surgery. So honestly, I would suggest going to your neuro about your symptoms, im pretty sure you might be having the same experience as me.\nI hope you feel better soon!!!! Yea I have the adjustable shunt and they have been experimenting with different pressures but so far none have helped with the headaches. There is one more pressure setting before it cannot be adjusted any higher so hopefully that is the magic number.", "Airports/flying I have a certas programmable VP shunt.

Friends or family members usually. The neurosurgeon that placed it retired years ago, plus he was in GA and i live in Ohio now.\n\nMy fiance will be with me. It is good about advocating for me. Nice! Sorry this is happening to you. I am glad you have someone to advocate for you. \n\nSymptoms they ask me about: balance, headaches, sleeping. \n\nI am just someone with a VP shunt, but all of those symptoms would definitely get me believing I had a change is csf pressure. \n\nI realized I did not directly respond to your question: it could absolutely be the cause of headaches. Yeah you need surgery for a new one...run to the  ER I was just in the ER Friday they did a x-ray and said my ventricle do not show increased pressure. Or something like that. It hurts too bad to remember exactly what they said Get to the ER NOW for surgery. This same thing happened to me in 2016. The doctors ignored me and I ended up with irreparable brain damage and a TBI. If i go they will just tell me I am fine again If you have a broken implant you are not fine. Well they will not do anything cuz there is no increased pressure or wtf ever they said. Sorry I am not trying to be a bitch I am just grumpy cuz i do not feel good. I have been told by my surgeon that often people will have increased pressure with little to no changes in ventricle size, and most of the time the only true way to tell is with a lumbar puncture or something called a shunt puncture. I was in this boat but avoided any punctures to get evidence of increased pressure, my surgeon went off my symptoms instead. I hope you can get this taken care of soon and recover alright They have been talking for years about removing my shunt cuz it was not needed anymore. Ugh apparently i do need it Hey, just checking in on you. \n\nI hope you are making it, internet stranger. The Dr changed me from Emgality to Amovig and gave me toradol and a referral to a headache specialist.\n\nThanks for checking on me!! It sounds like you have this covered. Best of luck to you! Hello Internet stranger, are you taking cate of yourself? Hello! I am trying. Are you? Likewise, trying! MRI soon. If you have had any of those in the past, try to get them sent to the doctor. Having those to compare may help. Maybe things do not get so spacey and slow motion for you. Maybe you have no time for that. \n\nI wish the best for you. I hope you are feeling better soon", "Does anyone know if Hydrocephalus can have a negative impact on intelligence ? I was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus as a baby and following that, they put in a shunt, and it occurred to me that it potentially could have had adverse effects on my intelligence, and I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit had any thoughts on this. It can and often causes some brain damage. However, its not normally measurable because there is no baseline so if youre functioning fine, it is really not important. This damage obviously is not always to cognition either. My wife was diagnosed later in life. Had had several surgeries and was in a coma fire several weeks due to side effects of multiple ventrivle inflation deflation cycles. Her primary side effect has been short term memory loss.  I was diagnosed and treated as an infant, and I have done pretty well in general. My only concern is to do with certain cognitive functions, and my balance and stuff. Anyone any info?  Get tested for a learning difficulty. I do not know the specifics as far as what test, but I know we were initially looking to see if I had ADD or ADHD, and it was discovered that I have a TBI relating to hydrocephalus that impairs my short term and working memory. It took a long time for my parents to finally get me tested, because I honestly understood things in school really well. My issues were (and are) with completing assignments in a timely manner, breaking things down, and other things. The test will identify cognitive impairment, and from there you can look into cognitive behavioral therapy things if you feel you need it. As the top comment says, it can cause some brain damage. If you are asking the question, it is probably a good idea to get tested for learning difficulties. It was a really eye-opening and empowering thing for me actually. I finally had an answer to these weird problems that I faced in school and I could start working on ways to circumvent the issues. Thanks! I have no idea how I would go about doing that here in Ireland. I will ask my doctor next time I am in. Yeah, I am not sure what the process would be like in Ireland but I would imagine you would have access to similar resources that I have in the US. Tardy to the party but this sub is not very active, so.. there is a link between hydrocephalus with VP shunt and Nonverbal Learning Disorder. As I understand symptoms include difficulty with math and motor skills such as sports, dancing, penmanship and tying your shoes. This fits me to a T but when I was growing up back in the 70s NLD/NVLD was not even being diagnosed. Might be something to look into. It can affect it. I personally have had learning difficulties all my life which I am sure is directly related to Hydrocephalus. My mom said I got brain damage from the csf and my heart stopping and my coma I was in and I struggle with school and basic functions. Especially right now that is it is messing up.", "Confused about daughter\u2019s diagnosis for arrested hydrocephalus I gave birth to identical twins 6 weeks ago (PPROM due to TTTS) which led to one twin getting a grade 3 ivh bilateral brain bleed (which resolved) which led to hydrocephalus diagnosis.\n\nShe is been monitored continuously and had a MRI last week after which the doctors have informed that she currently does not need any intervention as her ventricles have started to decrease in size and head circumference has not increased in more than a week and is currently within the normal percentile for a 37 weeker (she was born at 31 weeks) at 35cm. They call this arrested hydrocephalus but I am a bit apprehensive about this.\n\nShe is just 37 weeks corrected age and I am worried that it should not be a case of mis diagnoses. Please advise if I need to look out for any symptoms that I can flag to the doctors to see if she truly needs an intervention. I know she may face developmental delays due to the bleed but I do not want to rob her off any chance she may have in the future to lead a better life. This is possible. What type of hydro was she first diagnosed with? You will know soon enough if her condition changes. FWIW I have/had communicating hydro from a hemorrhage last year and my doctor that I have now says that communicating hydro can in fact get better with time. He even offered to change my shunt setting last time I saw him to see what would happen, so it is possible it is resolved. Not an expert but with my little one her head circumference was clearly growing rapidly. I would think if you keep an eye on that it should be clear if there is any worsening of the condition. My wife has congenital aqueductal stenosis, due which possibly, she had developed moderate hydrocephalus since birth. Though, We found about it last year, her 29th birthday. She never had any problem whatsoever except some headaches here and there. \n\nHer case is arrested hydrocephalus and doctor said she may not any intervention for whole life. Her body compensated her hydrocephalus. Do not know what type. Just says hydrocephalus. Hope it stays the way it is :(", "My headaches get worse everyday, Does this sound like they are related to my VP shunt? I know the obvious answer would be shunt failure, but let me explain. I started having on and off dull headaches about a year and a half to two years ago. Since then I have had many CT scans, MRIs, etc. All non invasive testing has been done and shows my ventricles are slit like, but fine. I have a VP Codman programmable shunt. Heres where it gets interesting.\nI had an MRI in September of 2016, it appeared fine. I had my shunt reset and was on my way.\nMonths later in January of 2017, I went to the ER because my headaches were so bad. A CT scan revealed my valve had reset to 200, it is usually at 70. I do not know what changed the setting, possibly the MRI, possibly me hitting something though I do not recall hitting my head on anything. I had no symptoms other than a headache during that time. While my pressure was at 200, my ventricles did not change in size, I was fine walking, talking, passed all neurological exams, etc. My neurosurgeon suggested that because of this, I do not really use the shunt. I had my shunt reset back down to 70 and the headache subsided a lot, though I still had a bit of a dull headache.\nA couple weeks later, I went in for an X-Ray because I had a similar headache as the one I did when the pressure was at 200. X ray revealed my pressure was at 120, so my shunt had reset itself... again. All of these altered pressures have only resulted in me having a headache, I have no other symptoms, no nausea, vomiting, increased pressure behind my eyes, etc.\nIf I am not greatly affected by shunt pressure changes, what does that imply?\nMy neurosurgeon told me we have done everything non invasive, and that the only option now is an exploratory surgery.\nI am only asking this on here because I am curious if anyone has dealt with something similar. My neurosurgeon said he has not dealt with something like this before. When you say that your ventricles are slit-like, do you have slit ventricle syndrome? Could you be overdraining? Even though your ventricles appear unchanged between scans I do think that your headaches could definitely be due to your shunt.\nThat being said, I do not have a ton of shunt info, only what I read on FB groups. My daughter has an ETV. \nGood luck, I hope you get answers soon! I do not know what the numbers mean, but if they mean when they get bigger that you are draining more, you probably have a low pressure headache. They really suck. You get them when they draw CSF from your spine. \n\nIn November I had my VP shunt taken out because it had calcified and it made me have constant headaches. All I could do was lay in bed and breathe. The more stuff I did, the more it hurt. They took it out and gave me an ETV and life is good now. Maybe it is that?", "Any foods or supplements to avoid if you have hydro/ intercranial hypertension ? A Nuero suggested I get an LP and I never did. I wanted to wait for my back issues to heal.  Skull pressure has been off the charts after exercising or a new supplement I take. This could be intercranial hypertension or Csf I am not sure. Any thing you guys avoid eating? Caffine, etc...The supp had a ton of b12. Throughout the year I have noticed bad reactions to straight b12. Or it was the exercise. I going back to the nuero ASAP. Alcohol, excess sodium Exercise?

I have been having headaches for years now, and every time I go to the ER with a shunt, they of course send me for a ct. I have recently been getting MRIs to avoid all the radiation but the amount of scans I have had really concerns me. I understand the need, but has anyone else had as many or more scans? It is one thing that really concerns me for my health later on in life. I have had 50 plus scans... and have had no problems, so far. \n\nI avoid the scanners at the airport just in case the officials are wrong that they do not emit radiation.   A pat down can be  faster than waiting in line for a scan. I am 28 and I was diagnosed shortly after birth and I have had 27 shunt revisions all of them being emergency revisions. I have had probably over 20ish ct scans. It really does not concern me because there really is not anything that I can do about it. Of my head, probably 20 or so. I also have tethered cord. I have had many CTs for my spine and even facial CTs. So closer to 30, I would say. It is what it is. It is necessary to make sure we are okay. I could not begin to count the number of scans my son has had. I would guess over 100. Can you request a pat down instead of going through the machine? Huh, TIL. One revision per year :(\n\nWould you mind sharing what has happened? My 2 1/2 year old daughter has a VP shunt and has had 6 CTs.  We now fight for MRIs every time.  We have won that fight 4 or 5 times now. \n\nWe were just unaware of the risks of CT scans in the beginning and were just scared 1st-time parents.  It was her full-time neurologist that pushed us to stop letting her get them. \n\nIn all fairness, we have never had a true failure of the device.  She has not needed a revision, emergency or otherwise.  We consider ourselves very lucky. Not sure, but most of them was before I started Kindergarten, and I have only had a total of 3 or 4 since. I have been freaking out so much because of the one abdominal CT scan I had a few days ago. Scared shitless, losing sleep and all about how the radiation might have affected me. And then I find you all having dozens of CT scans.\n\nWords are not enough, but I really wish the best for all of you :) Absolutely.   I walk past the long line, to the first agent, request a pat down.  Then they ask: do you need a private room? Say no, raise your arms and smile. So many. Easily 50+, and like 15 MRIs.", "Shunt monitors are about to begin testing!!!! ", "Symptoms 8 months after my ETV. Hi Everyone. \n\nIn 2019.08.07. i had an ETV surgery. My recovery was long but in a medical sense we can say successful. I had a control MRI in January and de doctor said that my figures are very good. My third ventricle reduced from 13 mm to 5 mm and the side chambers are also nicely reduced from 21 mm to 17 mm so there is no more to do. Basically im pretty good because i can play tennis im walking a lot im riding bicycle and my thinking is also perfectly fine but.....Im very sensitive to the sun and i am unable to lift things(+15 Kg) without hurting my head. Not a very good feeling.:( Today i went for a walk with the dog and left my hat at home. I thought it wouldnt hurt but it did. The sun shook my head for about 30 minutes and i started to feel the previous symptoms like pressure in my head, dizziness and nausea...I have the same symptoms when i try to lift things like a bigger shopping. I try to reassure myself that everything will be fine and i look at the positive side of everything but sometimes its difficult. Does anyone have similar experience? Talk to a doctor about that for sure. I had an ETV in June last year and found some weird symptoms for 6 months ( weird brain zap things, dizziness on occasion, no headaches though) but they have since all subsided. That is my personal experience though. Talk to your doctor. I got an ETV and I did not attempt any intense physical activity for a solid 2 years after. Now, I am fine for those kinds of things. It is better to take precaution and just check in with your dr than to worry! :-)", "EVT vs shunt? My 4 month old has hydrocephalus from a stroke most likely in utero... if dr.s gave you the chance which option would you choose? I am leaning towards the EVT with choroid plexus cauterization but the high risk scares me, and it is 50% success rate is not very reassuring either.. I would appreciate any insights. I got a shunt as a 3 week old baby, and my shunt calcified and broke in several places in my neck as a young adult. It caused a bunch of complications, that were really more every day inconveniences for the most part, but growing up, I could not exercise without pain in my neck where the tube was. I am sure if my parents had to do it all again, they would probably pick ETV, but if it is that much of a crapshoot, I would stick with the shunt. What inconveniences I grew up with (and still have, even with parts of it removed) were just that--inconvenient. I was very lucky either way. I feel like ETVs are somewhat \"double or nothing\" in this respect.\n\nWhen I do not know what to do, I flip a coin, but instead of looking at it, the moment I am about to, I try to think what I hope it is. Usually, that helps me figure out what I really think is best deep down.\n\nThis is a really hard choice you have to make, but I know that you will make the right one either way. Thank you for your reply, that is helpful. It is hard when I read all these stories online of families who have been in and out of the hospital for years with infections and shunt  revisions. It sounds like a total nightmare. It is really scary when you hear about all these kids and their worst case scenarios. I never had a real problem until my sophomore year of college. It is a little rare, but we do exist. My daughter had a vp shunt placed when she was a few weeks old for hydrocephalus as she was very premature with a grade 3 ivh. For her at least an evt was not even an option. She needed two revisions before her second birthday, which we were told is fairly common for under two years old. She does not have any issues with her shunt on a day to day basis. Plays like a normal kid and never complains or shows any discomfort in the area. She does not like her hair being messed with too much in the area, but is honestly not a fan of much head wear after having hospital accessories for many months. Am not a doctor, but my kid has hydrocephalus since shortly after birth and had both the ETV and a VP shunt.\n\nIf both are an option, I would start with the ETV personally.  If it works, it is a one and done and you do not have to worry about a shunt.  Even if it does not work, it may help clear out old tissue that would gum up a shunt and/or reduce CSF output, both of which would help the shunt\u2019s functioning, I believe.  \n\nIn our case, we did ETV first and it helped but did not resolve the issue.  So we had a VP shunt placed about a week or two later.  There is a lot of stress with the shunt - basically even minor infections/tummy bugs get treated as a possible shunt failure until they can rule it out.  Things that would be no big deal for a baby without a shunt get escalated fast.  So while it is working and medically necessary, I would roll the dice on the ETV first before the shunt.  \n\nGood luck! I have adult onset hydrocephalus and was at my neurosurgeon yesterday with shunt complications. This is when I got told that a VP shunt has a 44-50% failure rate in the first three years...wish I had all the information before I made the decision to get it. TY for your comment, we decided to try surgery before going strait to a shunt. ETV and shunts have basically the exact same failure rate at each other. I am not a fan of an ETV/CPC. In fact there are lots of countries that do not perform this surgery due to the many unknowns. \n\nWe are only now understanding how CSF gets to our brain. It is through the plexus.\n\nMy son has had shunts and a failed ETV. I have told them I would never try it again. Hope yours was successful. Thank you, he has surgery on friday. Keep us posted. How did it go? It was postponed to this Friday the 27th, he caught a cold and they do not want to perform surgery while he is sick. Thanks for checking in, I will try to remember to update afterwards. Hi he is doing good, surgery went perfectly now he is trying to rest snd get pain managed. Hope the surgery went well! I think you made a good choice trying the ETV. My son got one at 4mo, and he is now almost 3 years old with no issues. Also, since it has been over two years without any complications,  we do not have to worry about it closing up too much. \n\nHe is very social and bright for his age. Just after his second birthday he was starting to read, recognizing numbers to 100, and would constantly talk about the planets and moons in our solar system, hah. Gross motor is still a little behind though, and his head is on the larger side of course. \n\nHow is your son post op.? It went great! Etv is open and his head size went down slightly thank God. Im glad your son has not had an issue either, at this point I am so glad we tried this first. I have noticed my sons motir skills seem far behind as well, he is just now grabbing at toys and only on the right side. He also cannot lift his head up on tummy time or sit up unassisted quite yet.", "Getting a bit worried now I have been feeling different over recent days and i feel like my shunt is failing. my symptoms are:\n-Bump beside shunt\n-bump on my neck where the tube passes\n-the back of my head feels sore to touch also feels kind of soft\n\n\nI have an appointment on the 17th as a check up. i do not have headaches or any of the main symptoms. any of you reddit doctors reckon my shunt is failing? Or for that matter what could it be if not a shunt failure? Is your appointment on the 17th with a neurosurgeon or a general practice physician? I would call them and let them know your situation. It does not sound like a shunt failure but maybe the tubing has a break. I would at least make sure the doctors know what is going on. If they are concerned they will make space for you. If they think you just need a check up though they will not consider that. You have to be your biggest advocate sometimes. it is a neuro. Good. I would just make sure you talk directly to a nurse or doctor and make sure they know your situation. If you made the appointment with a receptionist for example the potential urgency of your situation may not have made it through to your care team. I contacted one of the main nurses at my hospital and described these symptoms and they said i should just come in on the 17th to see how things are. Thanks. God i love this subreddit Same team!

He had a spinal tumor removed through cervical spine surgery two years ago. Couple of years later he had many complications including a difficulty swallowing.\n\nIt turns out that this was caused by the hardware implantation during spine surgery which caused many secondary complications. He had another reconstructive surgery where they removed the plate. His recovery after this was not smooth and he had infections for several days.\n\nThe doctors are now saying he has hydrocephalus. Now they are recommending shunt surgery. My friend' is finally making significant progress and is able to walk on his own. They do not want the surgery if it is an option.Added to that he has no symptoms related to hydrocephalus. The hydrocephalus diagnosis was based on one CT scan of the brain with the second scan showing no worsening. No follow up tests have been done such as lumbar drainage or lumbar infusion test. When the neurosurgeon was asked if his progression is getting worse or the same he said it is not getting worse.Any general thoughts on the following questions from someone knowledgeable are appreciated.\n\n1. If he is largely asymptomatic with respect to hydrocephalus and the evidence is only a single CT scan, should not other tests be conducted before recommending shunt surgery\n2. If the patient is largely asymptomatic, what is the risk associated with waiting to see if the symptoms progress for the worse?\n3.

I also worry for you since you appear to have epilepsy and I know how hard that can be. Please find a safe driver to take you and get the treatment. \n\nIt is of course your decision to seek treatment but the permanent damage that is possible, is far worse than a night at the hospital.  It is probably a CT scan the docs want to perform. Not an MRI, CT scans do not cause shunt changes. \n\nGoing from experience here: CTs are quick and easy, do not affect the shunt functions and will provide a clear picture into what is going on in your head (literally). Please go to the local ER. I looked at your profile on Reddit and the symptoms (migraines, seizures, vision changes) are all symptoms not to ignore and should be a red flag to get urgent care. I have an etv so mri is ok. My parents (who I live with) want me to get an appt with an NS first.

I hope it helps someone out. I think something I read here that really resonated with me is that you really have to be your own advocate. Even when the scans do not agree, you know what you are going through the best. \n\nI am a medical student, which makes going through all of this both easier and harder. Easier in the sense that I can understand a lot of the medical terminology, harder in the sense that, well, med school lol. \n\nDuring the start of my first year of medical school, I slipped down 18 steps in my second floor apartment. My roommates and a few friends watched me slip, and none of us could make sense as to how it happened. I do not recall hitting my head either. Anyways, I had gone to an urgent care for back  and neck pain and headaches. They diagnosed me with a back contusion, put me on steroids, and sent me my way. Three weeks later, the headaches just got unbearable, and I decided I had to go to my school's ER. They found right-side weakness and the scans showed my ventricles were twice the size of a normal person's. Anyways, I was transferred to another hospital. My spinal tap showed normal pressure, at which point the surgeon was considering sending me home and observing. However, the next morning, my walking was very unstable and so they decided to operate. I got a ETV done, as a 23 year old I did not want a shunt in me. After speaking to doctor's, we were leaning towards the fact that perhaps the hydrocephalus and loss of balance caused me to slip down the stairs. As a kid, no doctor ever mentioned having it. Thankfully the procedure went well, and I even started doing research with my surgeon on the benefits of a laparascopic VP Shunt approach. \n\nFast forward almost a year later, I started having very similar headaches again. My eyes started to hurt a lot, and I felt dizzy and somewhat off balance. My scans showed no real change, so my surgeon decided to do a lumbar puncture as a last rule-out. He was not expecting anything out of the ordinary. Even my parents were doubtful; they just felt I was being too sensitive to headaches and what not. All the meanwhile, I knew something seemed off and it was way to similar to my symptoms last year. Anyways, the LP revealed a high pressure in my skull, one that could cause permanent damage to my eye sight.  It was decided there that I need a VP shunt, and I had surgery a few days later. \n\nI am two weeks post-op now, and it has been quite a tough recovery for me. I think mentally, I am more drained than when I had the ETV done, and the incisional pain is quite prominent for me. It definitely was and feels like a way more invasive procedure, and as a medical student, I am a bit worried about how this will impact me moving forward. \n\nThat is my story for now, would love to answer any questions! Thank you for sharing your story. \nI am a 48-year-old woman who has had hydrocephalus my whole life. My shunt was installed when I was 28 days old.\nIt most recently malfunctioned in 2017. It was caught too late and the pressure built up on my optic nerves and left me blind. So, I am so glad that you pushed for more tests and they proceeded with putting in a VP shunt.  \nMine is also a VP shunt.\n\nI do not feel it alone will have a negative impact on your future or your career in medicine. \nSo long as you are proactive and keep up with your neurologist whenever you need to, you can live quite a normal life. \n\nWhat is your area of focus? Maybe neurology?? LOL \n\nThank you for sharing your story! I wish you nothing but success and good health. I was born with hydro (dxed at 1 day old, first surgery at 3 days old), currently med scribing to save $$ to get mcat/ start the process of applying to med school Mine is the result of a hypothalamic 3rd ventricle tumour. \nI get what you mean  are the med student, I studied psychology at degree level ( appreciate that is no way on par with medicine but obviously heck of a focus on the brain) and I felt if slightly comforting but also more terrifying when discussing. \n\nIt takes some time getting used to it, you will have good and bad days. May give you a different or greater understanding with future patients.\n\nGood luck I am an 18 (almost 19) year old girl with hydrocephalus. I was born with it but I was not diagnosed until I was about 4 months old. They put a vp shunt in me on the right side of my head. It never really malfunctioned until after a fall I took last year in gym class when I hit the right side of my face on the hard wood floor. My mom noticed that my face looked fuller, I was falling more than usual, and I was just acting weird. Though the thing that made her say \"we need to get this checked out\" was one night after school I was feeling pretty tired so I laid down to take a nap, well a few hours later my mom came in to wake me up for dinner and I was completely unresponsive and laying face flat on my pillow and when she finally woke me up I was really out of it. So she called the hospital and they got me in as soon as possible. Long story short my catheter ended up being out of place and I ended up having 3 brain surgeries (because things just kept going wrong with my shunt) within the span of a month this year alone and now I have a programmable shunt. Did they ever give you a cause for the hydro? I am also curious why they did not try the Etv again So you have both an etv and a vp shunt? Or now just one?

(Then I had had it for around 17 years) \nUp to a certain point everything\u2019s was fine, I had no problems and no symptoms. But lately I have started to notice some discomfort and symptoms. Not sure it is connected to the shunt, but atm the doctors suspect that it is.\n\nI wonder if anyone here has experienced something similar and would like to share. Have your shunt(s) suddenly stopped working, do you know how long before any symptoms appeared, and what symptoms did you get in that case? There is no way to tell without diagnostic imaging like CT or MRI to check for enlarged ventricles/increased CSF (spine juices lol). If there is any suspicion of a malfunction, you need to be seen by a doc and get a scan. My shunt malfunctioned after 4 years. 1st time when I was initially diagnosed, I had a TERRIBLE headache while doing pull-ups. Got the shunt, four years later it malfunctioned. This time was similar, I was bench pressing at the gym and got another weird headache, not as bad, but still pretty bad. So for me the symptom is exertions headaches. But it is different for everyone. There is no concrete way to diagnose a malfunction without adequate imaging. Thank you for sharing! \nI am currently in line for an MRI scan, so soon we will know for sure. After my shunt examination three years ago they said nothing needs to be done, but now some doctors seem to reconsider. Awesome! So now you will know for sure.

It turns out my shunt is not working, but that I no longer need it. It has most likely not worked for a couple of years. I did not know I can go without, but I am relieved.

Thanks everybody! Cannot help you with health care as I am Australian but I have had a lot of shunt revisions so I am all up on the entertainment haha. I read a lot in hospital. When the pain is too bad, I listen to music, if you are not into music, find a podcast to binge. I do not like TV but if you do, find a new show to binge. If possible, I would suggest trying to get up and about to do these things, do not just stay in bed. If you are in hospital, they may have a Cafe or some gardens you can sit in so you can get up and out of bed. I also knit and crochet because I find it does not hurt my head as much as reading. Some memory and thought issues are normal after any neurosurgery and will get better but you can make it faster by working your brain. So if you like sudoku or phone games or crosswords then get lots of them, they will help.\n\nI hope you have a quick recovery and are feeling better soon =) Thank you! I had Ideas but for some reason I was having a hard time actually searching haha. I just binge watched youtube and netflix all February after I had my shunt replaced.

My short term memory could be better to say the least etc. I wear glasses for Astigmatism and Near Sightedness.along with Bi-Focals..\nEven though I have glasses it is still hard to focus on letters when reading, especially smaller print. How has your Hydrocephalus affected your vision even when you wear glasses? Thanks for any replies! I have only had my shunt for about 9 months but recently I have been having problems with my one eye being lazy and not focusing with my other eye. I am 51. I developed hydrocephalus in 2020. Thanks. Do you know what caused your Hydro.? Mine was from Aquaductile Stenosis brought on from a car accident at 19. I have had hydrocephalus and vision problems since birth. I was one of those cute babies in glasses. I have had 3 strabismus eye surgeries and on the wait list for a 4th strabismus surgery. I find my eyes switch between left or right for which eye is the dominant focusing eye. Vision problems usually go hand in hand with us hydrocephalus warriors. They did not know. I still have not gotten any answers. I have sleep apnea and I drank for 30 years so I kind of think it has something to do with that. IDK Funny but not funny..I have sleep apnea as well.\nHad surgery years ago to address it but I still have minor sleep apnea. I wear CPAP now. Gotcha..thank you for replying. I like the warriors comment. Like we are Super Heros. You got to be tough to go through it all. Yeah I love/hate my cpap but it makes me sleep sooo much better. \nWhat surgery did you have for it?\nDo you know your ahi score without the cpap?\nMine was at 43 ahi. I am just asking to see what surgery can do I had a septoplasty( Dr. cleaned out my blocked sinus so I could breath better through my nose. A Uvula reduction( they stitched \"the thing that hangs down in the back of your mouth\" to the roof of my mouth), and a tonsillectomy.( removal of tonsills). \nIt was worse than having my shunt surgery. It was an out patient procedure but they kept me overnight because I have Hydrocephalus. After that I could not work for two weeks. They gave me liquid Demerol for the pain. It was so hard to swallow. It did help with alot of my sleepiness but I guess it does not cure sleep apnea because I recently had another sleep study and they said I stopped breathing 10 times an hour so I qualified for CPAP. Wow that is a lot to go through. I am not even sure whether I even have my tonsils or not. The cpap is working well for me so idk if I would try surgery but I am weighing the options. Cpap is fine until you want to go camping or something then it is a pain. \nHave you had success with the cpap? So far Yes. I sleep much better. My wife said before I slept like  a dead man. Now I sleep even heavier. That is if I can get my mask to stay on my face without leaking air. I do not think I am as sleepy during the day as well. That is good there has definitely been a learning curve with the cpap. Well it is been nice chatting with you and hearing your story. best of luck to you. Hope your vision stuff gets all sorted out. This is very curious. I was also cross-eyed as a kid. My dad found a surgeon out of New York that fixed it with eye exercises and not surgery. All other eye docs were telling my dad surgery was the only way. I wore all types of coke bottle sized glasses and eye patches and by the time I was 13 the crossing was no longer visible to the naked eye. My left eye is the lazy one. There were also several years pre-puberty that I used to get mega migraines 4-5 days a years. They were excruciating. I went home afterschool and slept from afternoon until the next day. Leave it to be 40 years old now with kids to raise and find out I have a benign tumor that is been there since birth. Its turned me into a hypochondriac. What was the cause of yours? Shunted at 7 weeks. Blind until I was six months, still cannot see in my right eye. Got my first pair of glasses at age 3. Wow. You have been through through some stuff. How old are you now? 44. No major eye problems since I got glasses at 3. The only issues I have with not seeing out of one eye is not having the same depth perception as others. Made playing sports challenging. What sports were you able to play having a shunt? Attempted soccer when I was little but it was no fun always getting hit with the ball. Played basketball for a few years, but I was always the worst on the team. I do not have the coordination for sports. I swam crocked as a kid, was off step at dance recitals, hidden in the middle of the marching band because I was usually off step, and was never given a dancing role in the school plays. I am legally blind in my right eye from the fluid. Glasses do not help. What is idea is your shunt on? That sounds too familiar. Always been clumsy and uncoordinated.

My daughter had a grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage that they tried to let run its course before they ended up needing to shunt her. She was an infant and had frequent imaging done. I see. Thanks for the info. I wonder how they would go about figuring this out if they have already placed the shunt? Because she was born very premature IVH is very common. They do lots of scans and track it from day to day. The hope is that the brain will absorb and process the blood that is not suppose to be there without forming any sort of scar tissue and occlusion. Thanks for the info How old are you? 27 Probably it will not be better overtime unless you are lucky enough to make it better. Here is my experiences. When I was only 3months, my parents find out that I had this Hydrocephalus stuff. Then we went to hospital in Shanghai. With the blessing of God, I got cured. But this good situation only last for only 5 years. The doctor said the shunt was not working very well and the tube inside of body need to be replaced. After all, I just did the operation and then everything goes well. Until 2017,  I was doing sit-ups for the next coming physical test. Then I feel like my brain is going to explode. Then we went to hospital to seek for the solution. Then I did the operation. But the result was too bad. I felt headaches really often. I just cannot go to school for class. I stayed at home for a week. In case I was not able to catch up with my classmates I did my last operation.  Things going pretty well at first month. Then the headache came again. The doctor said I just need to adapt the headaches. And he also mentioned that it is very hard for teenagers to adapt the unstable pressure in my head.

I am a highly active paraplegic, and often deal with neck aches and pains. Yes. Sometimes my tubing hurts or around the unit hurts and it actually originates in my shoulder and if I massage that, I feel that hurts so good sensation and it goes away. Sometimes I can also press right where my skull connects to my spine (there are two spots right on either side of the spine there) and I can feel it up and down my whole tube. Sometimes I get back of the neck pain. Could that be related? My neck hurts from time to time. Especially if I overextend it and it pulls on the tubing or if I sleep wrong.

Can someone suggest a video that explains it? ", "How did you find out you have hydrocephalus? I had a massive brain tumor (vestibular schwannoma) and after they got all of the tumor out I started gushing CSF from my incision. They tried to drain it and see if the fluid stopped. They tried medical super gluing me shut. But I kept leaking. Then I had another surgery to cut my incision open again and clean everything out and closed me up again. Still I was leaking. Then I had a week of spinal drainage hell. Still kept leaking after. So they decided my overproduction of CSF was chronic and needed a non programmable VP shunt. ~hydrocephalus~ Just curious how you all got diagnosed. Ps. I was 19 years old when diagnosed with the brain tumor and 20 when I got my first shunt. Aw that sounds so traumatic, sorry you had to go through all that. I got diagnosed with a tumour at 22 and they tried to remove it but had to leave a small piece due to its location. That piece grew just a tiny bit and began to block natural drainage of the CSF about a year later. They needed to add a programmable shunt to reroute the drainage as the tumour was acting as a plug. Hope you are doing ok now :) Weighed 10lbs at birth, could not hold my head up. First surgery was at two weeks, second at 2 months, third at two years. Forth at 21 and last (hopefully) at 22. As a 13 yo I had fallen at school bc of balance along w/ other issues and so the nurse suggested to my mom that I go to the ER rather than the doctor. I found out at the ER that the amount of pressure on my brain was at 90,or nearly 10 times as high as it should be. I,of course,was rushed to the O.R. to get one of what is now 11 brain surgeries. I also currently have 3 VP shunts. The past 3 years have been a real rollercoaster for my family and I, with me going only about 3 or 4 months w/o another complication. Was born at 61/2 months premature, had a brain bleed which led to an overproduction of CSF. Had a shunt fitted at 6 weeks then my first revision at 29. I was 10 months when diagnosed with choroid plexus papilloma (non-cancerous tumour) - the hydrocephalus did not resolve after they got the tumour out.\n\nWhen I was about 8 months my mum was told i was just colicky, then they thought stomach bug, and then I was hospitalised at the point of alternating between high pitched screaming while \"trying to crawl away from my head\" and passing out and going totally floppy.\n\nIt was thought I stopped using the shunt soon after it went in, but that was proved wrong 16 years later when it was decided the headaches I was having were due to it getting 'tugged' so it was partially removed. Severe headache, nausea, loss of balance and lethargy afterwards proved that I was indeed still using the shunt and I was 'rediagnosed'. Similar. Had a tumor resected and then was leaking fluid out, with a huge pseudomeningocele. After three weeks of it not resolving with an exterior Ventriculostomy they installed a programmable shunt so I could finally go home I am doing okay, I just never even thought to look out for people \u201clike me\u201d who also live with hydrocephalus. It is easy to lie to myself and say that it was not that bad and *is not* but it is impossible to ignore everyone else who is also feeling the reality of this condition. How are you doing now? Tumor/hydro buddies! Lol Cheers! My last brain surgery was in January 2018 and hopefully my last too You have 3 VP shunts inside of you right now?? Not bad for their expiration dates being 10 years maximum from placement! Hope you are well Jeez I have always wondered what it would have been like to have grown up with a shunt instead of having my first one placed at age 20. Hope you are doing well! Thanks for sharing Hospital days are ridiculously longer than days at home. Glad you got the care you needed I was 21 and got the worst headache. I got a MRI, it showed an arachnoid cyst. I convinced a dr to do a spinal tap. It showed high pressure. They removed the cyst and I have been somewhat better since. Haha, yes, absolutely! I am all good, a little stuffy with the current weather but good otherwise. Hope you are well too! Yes,but my brain decided it would completely compartmentalize so no natural flow is occurring. If the compartmentalization had not occured,I would only have 2. As I said,it is been quite a rollercoaster these past 3 years. I have learned so much about the medical field it is a wonder I still want to work in medicine Wow, I have never heard of that but that totally makes sense! Where are the VP shunt \u201cknots\u201d on your head? You do not have a shunt? One back right,one back left,and one front left Thanks for sharing :) Np Similar story. Hypothslic 3rd ventical pilocytic astrocytoma. Major headaches with sickness and visual disturbance plus other symptoms. Had an external drain post biopsy and debulking and could not cope when they  turned it off so shunt fitted. Got infected and replaced within a couple of weeks. Csf leak about 6 months post as an internal stitch had not dissolved but touch wood it is all on track now Good to hear!! No. I was fortunate that the cyst was the main cause for the hydrocephalus. Sometimes they shunt cysts but I read so many times that shunts fail. My cyst was an posterior arachnoid cyst, so, it was easy to access. I lost my glasses in 10th grade, had to go get a new prescription since it had been a couple years. When the eye doctor was looking around my eyes he said there was some slight swelling behind them. He said it could just be nothing but he sent me over to get an MRI just in case. Found out I had a tumor near my brain stem causing non communicating obstructive hydro. No symptoms until they tried a ventriculostomy. Then everything started hitting, headaches, seizures, unexplained brain problems. Then they gave me a programmable shunt a couple months later. Been alright since my last shunt about 4 years ago(minus a couple random seizures) Wow. Shoutout to your optometrist! I actually got hit by a car and went to the ER and my doctor decided to get a head CT just to be safe too... I wish more doctors took this level of caution and care I kind of stumbled into it. I had been dealing with an acoustic neuroma that was going to have  to be surgically removed, but in the year prior to that I would been noticing little things--I would be walking and I would kind of shuffle-step on my left foot every so often, or I would be driving and my foot would suddenly slip off the gas pedal for no reason (drove my wife nuts). \n\nThey took the neuroma out and sent me home...and I started blanking out on my wife, had to keep my catheter in because I could not make myself pee, and when I fell in the bathroom and took out the shower curtain, my wife had had enough. Back to the hospital, back to the ER and the ICU, where they quickly diagnosed me and installed a drain. I came out of the fog relatively quickly and got very, very confused--had not I just been here?\n\nThey put a VP shunt in my head (left side) and 3 years later I am going strong. I was lucky to have one of the top neurologists in the region as my doctor for the neuroma, and shunts are a specialty with him. Apparently I recovered so well and so fast I was considered the Star Patient of 2017. :) Hey! I had an acoustic neuroma too. Glad to hear you are doing well, congrats! I had a huge head as a baby 30+ years ago and they were like \u201cwe should look at this\u201d This made me laugh out loud hahahaha sorry At age 9 in 2014 they found a penile cyst ( I think it is called )on an MRI scan its 13mm or 9mm I cant remember but I originally had a bypass but that scarred over, now I have a VP shunt. And the cysts around the tumour decided to grow so they are getting drained. Sorry to lay my whole life story", "Could I have Hydrocephalus? I mean no disrespect toward any of you coming here, asking this, as I know this is a terrible thing to deal with. I just wanted to ask a few things as I have a really hard time finding much information on this issue. \n\n1. Are headaches always involved? \n\n2. Any hallmark or notorious symptom that shout Hydrocephalus? \n\nI have been dealing with a undiagnosed medical problem for 2 years now. I have had blood taken countless times, kidney and heart scans, thyroid test, you name it, I have had it. CT scan (without contrast just a simple scan).\n\nMy problem is brain fog. It comes on suddenly and last anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple hours. I get very drowsy, cannot remember stuff, tired, cannot think straight, just feel very out of it. Then within an hour or however long it last, I am completely back to normal. This has been a daily thing for 2 years and have no life because of it. \n\nI do not deal with headaches, incontinence, just the cognitive problems. I am 21 years old. Is this even something worth pursuing? \n\nAgain, I do not mean to bug any of you with these types of questions, I am just practically on my own at this point and have to use resources like this to gain any insight on what I am experiencing. \n\nThanks. I did not have many symptoms, just brain fog and falling over a lot. I would get it checked out, just in case. I had an MRI which finally diagnosed me. Before that, I had some horrible eye test where they put cold water in my ear and measured my eye movements. Skip that if offered lol. Straight to the MRI. I forgot to mention, I did have a MRI when this first started. Does it have to be some specialized MRI to see it? As far as I know, no. You do not need any contrast or anything. Just a brain focused MRI Thanks for the help. Considering that, I probably do not have this. Have you gone to a neurologist? Hydrocephalus is quite common as far as conditions are concerned.  With an MRI, they will know pretty much right away. It is not like some super random disease caused by an endangered insect in New Guiana.  For me it took a while to discover what was wrong because I had not gone to a neurologist and had an MRI, once that happened I had surgery about 3 weeks later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you find a solution, no one here can diagnose you one way or the other. Please see a neurologist. I seen a neurologist, did not seem concerned. I also had a MRI when this started and a CT scan 7 months ago. That is good. the MRI scans are valuable. You can take them to other doctors too. If you had hydrocephalus it would be clear as day (imo, I am not a doctor).  Especially if it is the symptoms are as strong as you are describing. If your doctor does not diagnose you with hydrocephalus that is what I am inclined to believe. You can always get a second opinion. I hope you find out wtf is going on it sounds awful. It is awful unfortunately, but I am still trying. Thanks for the advice.", "Made a Hydro meme ", "I have never related so much to a movie clip ", "...  Get some counselling. I am 26 and only recently started to feel this way so I started counselling and it is helping. Outside of that, unfortunately it does take a lot more effort for things like maintaining friendships and hobbies. You could also try some new hobbies that you would be able to do even when youre sick.\n\nI am not advocating this at all, but I do tend to push it a bit too long when my shunt malfunctions rather than going straight into hospital. I will do it at a time that is convenient for me. Towards the end of my honours year I went downhill but waiting until I was at the write up stage to go to hospital because I could write there. This is how I have managed to stay a little more sane because I can normally do the things I love this way.\n\nIf your shunt is malfunctioning a lot more than previously then it could be worth talking to your surgeons. My shunt malfunctioned every couple of months until I was 10 and it got moved. Then it only blocked once a year or so. For the past 4 years it is been every 3 months again so we have tried moving it again and we will see what happens. It really depends on which part is blocking most of the time. There are options for almost anything though. I am sending you internet hugs. I am so sorry you are going through this. Look how much you have already been through! You can do this. \n\nAs far as socially awkward...that is so so so so normal for being a teenager. Typical teenagers are super awkward. You having a shunt makes you extra cyborgy cool. :) \n\nI would definitely go talk to your high school counsellor, or call your Dr and ask for a referral to a therapist. Even your neurosurgeon can probably help with that. Therapy can help in a lot of ways and is definitely worth trying. \n\nYou are so worthwhile. If you ever feel like ending it please reach out to a friend or family member, and call the suicide hotline or crisis hotline. You are important and special and deserve to feel that way. :)", "Neurosurgeon HAS talked to me about EVT Surgery, Need advice PLZ I have had trouble with the Codman/Hickman Programmable device from the get go. I have tried to convince TWO Neurosurgeons that I think EVEN though on a CT-scan the shunt looks fine, the symptoms I am constantly going through....well, it is been 15 yrs and I honestly think that there is issues with the programmable that the docs CANNOT SEE.\n\nYears ago, I kept vomiting and having severe headaches. The doctor kept telling me that the \"shunt\" (IT WAS a VP shunt back then) looked fine on CT-scans. Finally he decided to take me to the OR and take a \"look\" at the shunt......It was only 18 months old and when he took the shunt out, it FELL apart in his hands and had calcium &amp; protein deposits all over it. That shunt was replaced with another VP Shunt.\n\nFast forward 3-4 more years. The headaches and the vomiting and the Vertigo was ridiculous. I began seeing the Head of Neurosurgery, Professor &amp; Chair of the department. He decided to put a lower pressure shunt in...and that caused even more issues.....after another 23 shunt revisions (and a 55 day hospital stay....) The decision to put the Programmable shunt in was made.\n\n   Now, I still vomit daily and the headaches are relentless. With the current issues with pain meds, it is a joke. It is 4:30 am and this is what happens EVERY darn night. I sleep for 1-2 hours per night, and get up and that is the extent of my day. \n\nDue to the fact I had SOOO many issues with the 55 day stint in the hospital (BTW I was in the Neuro ICU for all but 48 hours of that stay, they tried to put me in a Step-Down unit....and I returned to the ICU. Finally the doctor make it clear to the insurance company he WAS NOT comfortable moving me out of  Neuro ICU...\u2026.I do not know too many patients that are DISCHARGED for Neuro ICU at all.\n\nSo, my question is.....did the EVT help you? Do you wish you had not had the surgery? I am 65 yrs old now, and while I am not afraid of the surgery itself, due to the horrendous issues I had previously, I am not sure I should do this. \n\nIn fact, during the 55 day hospital stay for all those revisions, it was discussed to the EVT then...and the Chief Neuro decided NOT to the EVT. I do not remember his reasonings for this, but I thought that due the fact he was Prof &amp; Chair of the Department.....he knew best.\n\nAny comments or suggestions would be appreciated. I see the Neurosurgeon on 10/23 in the afternoon. You sound like my son. Years of horrible symptoms with Codman shunt. His also fell apart when they finally took it out.\n\nWe tried the EVT. It didnt help at all.\n\nIn the end, he went across the country to an entirely different doc. He gave him a Syphysus (sp?) Shunt. This brand is popular in Europe but not in the US.\n\nI am not sure what the difference is but my kid has not been hospitalized since. Mamadog5\n    Thank you so much!!!\nI realize these doctors I have seen probably roll their eyes when I talk of that first VP shunt falling apart as it did, but I have been like this for years!\n     I am a little skeptical of doing the EVT due to the Chief Neurosurgeon previously stating that he PLANNED to do the EVT but during the surgery he thought better of it and did not do it. I wish I remembered his exact words as to his decision not to do the EVT but I do not. It depends on what your hydrocephalus is caused by that can determine whether you get an ETV or not.  ETVs are usually used when there is a structural blockage of some sort or when there is a narrowing of the pathway the CSF takes to exit the brain. If your hydrocephalus was caused by a different issue like a stroke or something, then it would not do you much good. My hydro was deemed congenital. I did not start having serious symptoms (other than occasional vomiting and headaches as a child) until I was in my late 20's early 30's and by chance one day when I took  my DD in for strep throat, the Primary Dr. who previously admonished me telling me that I was probably over reacting due to my DH having seizures that were extremely hard to control, took one look at me and asked me to get a CT-scan ASAP. I refused because I am an RN and had to report to work that day, but he was insistent, and finally wore me down and that is how the Hydro was discovered. AS I said previously the Chief Neurosurgeon/Prof. &amp; Chair of the Dept of the University of Michigan Hospital was the Dr. that at first thought the EVT would help, but decided not to do it when I was in the OR. Since the Codman-Hickman has been placed, I have had horrific head pain every single day. IF I can get the pain to an \"8\" on a 1-10 scale I feel pretty lucky. I think part of my issues with the doctor I have now is that most people who have these types of severe headaches are curled up into a ball for the most part and I have just learned to deal with them over the last few years. It is difficult but I refuse to lie in bed every single day. A Sophysa Polaris? ( . There are four shunt options with a range of settings, each shunt option with four adjustable/programmable settings. So the low range could be adjusted to high drainage to medium drainage for instance. That is great news that the pressure setting on this shunt seems to be working for your son! Best of luck!", "I wrote this blog post about different kinds of hydrocephalus/shunt related headaches. Let me know if I missed anything. I will go more into more detail on a later blog post.

I have got an absolutely horrible cold (not covid, I have tested). I am feeling miserable. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this?

I have a scar running vertically on the back of my head. Maybe it was from ICP monitoring? The external shunt you probably had prior to the internal shunt probably left that...closest I could come up with for \"trial\" shunt. My daughter has had that twice plus 3 revisions and a cranial decompression. I am sure if we shaved her whole head most of the top would covered in bald spots. It adds character! Does everyone have to have external shunts first? I never knew about those! From what i know they do external one in case of infection, once healed they put back internal one", "Being a student with hydrocephalus I am a graduate in psychology and learned today that there is additional paperwork needed but none that I had in mind. \nI have been an online student through MSU for three years and now they are saying my overall GPA of 2.25 (low due to two brain surgeries in college)  does NOT include my  major gpa. \nI never heard of this before,  has anyone else?  So they are not sending my degree unless I retake a class this summer. \nIt is so stressful to me because I just had another brain surgery in March,  like idk what else to do besides fight the system. I had similar issues going through undergrad. I had 5 revisions then which ranked my grades, and then 3 in my masters which I had a better outcome with, fortunately. The thing is that it is still tough to push those academic systems. You may need to retake the course anyways, but see what you can do about forgiveness on your record or possible forgiveness for grades. I had trouble getting that but it is still difficult, I feel your pain as in my PhD applications I frequently get the comment that my grades were too low, and it is surprisingly hard to argue medical reasons sometimes. Omg I feel your pain,  you are so damn strong!  Going for your doctorate too?! What is your major? \nI am 25 and feel like I should have been done with undergrad already. Should I talk to the dean about forgiveness since I just had brain surgery two months ago? Have you talked with your advisor? I would set up a meeting if you have not. In person (video call) can sometimes be more productive than email. Generally I would suggest working your way up the chain to sort out academic issues. That would be professor &gt; advisor &gt; department head &gt; dean of students. It sounds like you are really close to done. I would definitely consider signing up for the course in the chance that you do end up needing to take it. Yeah it is my advisor telling me this. \nDo not think a video call would work now,  they told me I can appeal it due to my extenuating circumstances. \nI graduated and they are trying to get tlme to spend more money. Can you tell me what MSU stands for? Missouri state university Hi, thanks! I am going for a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, and did my undergrad and masters on the same topic.  I feel you there, but it is important sometimes for us with hydrocephalus to remember that even though some others do not always recognize that we have a condition (where we are typically only sick when in critical condition and requiring revision, which for most occurs rarely).  Just see what is available, you should get something for it - I think I will be able to get an extension on my master's for it, for instance. Bummer. I went to a different MSU and had all kinds of issues with advisors, but unfortunately I do not think I can help you with this one but I hope you are able to figure it out and graduate. You got this! How did you get through it? That is so awesome! \nThe thing is I need this and am going to school again for nursing.  I just need this degree so I can hold a better job than caregiving/mental health assistant. The college is now saying I can appeal it. What is an extension? No helpful advice. I just did? Idk I just grinned and bore it and tried to figure things out in my own. I also almost did not graduate because I had forgotten to attend an exam and the exam was a large portion of the grade and the class was necessary to graduate but the professor was really kind and let me make it up. I also had a low undergrad gpa but thankfully my major gpa was good but I felt like I was always teetering on the edge of being disenrolled, but I made it through and now am having decent success in my career That is cool. \nWhat do you do now? I am a social worker That is good news! The extension is just so that I have an extra term to complete my degree.  I am running low on time for research due to COVID and my surgeries, and will likely require more time at this point.  It is important here as I am funded, and we then have to apply for a funding extension. Ahhh I see,  because you are a researcher?  I have a mentor - she has had 15 revisions and she is a neuroscientist here in Houston.  It is so many of us that are successful.  Gives me hope that it is not too late for me. \nI am 25 Yes, it is a thesis-based master's, and in Canada most thesis-based programs must have student funding.  Same age here! Do not lose hope yet, after all, Tom Brady was only drafted in the 6th round. Do you have social media?  I would like to follow you! \nAnd you are right. I wish I changed my major to nursing years ago but eh,  I will take what I have invested in psychology .\nEnd goal is using registered nursing as my activism for hydrocephalus research and investing in group homes for orphans who aged out.", "Just basic questions Hi, I have had a shunt since I was 16, and recently got another because the first got infected. I realized I was really oblivious with what i really have and just ask for tips I guess? \n\nWhen do I know for sure when the shunt is malfunctioning ? I usually think every headache is the literal end and I hate feeling like that constantly. \n\nSometimes when I am at the gym and try to use the bench press I feel a strain in my neck where the shunt is, should I stop using weights? Can sit ups effect it since I am pushing my stomach.\n\nCan the shunt kill me? I constantly think about it. Can it grow into a tumor? Is it a ticking time boom and I am doomed at any second?\n\nI really do appreciate any comments or tips you guys have \n\nThank you Curious about the answers, but most of all I would recommend you to ask these exact questions to your doctor. I had a lot of the same fears and doubts and nothing on the internet will give you the amount of certainty a doctor will.\n\nParticularly interested in knowing more about weightlifting and shunts, since I do it too. I have definitely done something to my system (nothing serious, but I \"noticed\") when dropping the weights in deadlifts so I stopped doing those. &gt; When do I know for sure when the shunt is malfunctioning ?\n\nAny time I get a headache that is above and beyond my 'normal'(which is sadly a daily migraine-like beast) and reaches into the 8.5-10 area of the pain scale, I tend to keep an eye on things... If the headache is situated over the shunt site or is a sudden, severe onset  and/or nausea I will err on the side of caution and get it looked at (times I am glad that I live in Canada).\n\n&gt; Can the shunt kill me?\n\nQuite the opposite...it is preventing potential brain damage caused by excessive fluid creating increased intracranial pressure. However, a malfunction could be dangerous and require further surgery to replace part or all of the shunt (both the tubing and the valve can potentially clog).\n\n&gt; Can it grow into a tumor?\n\nNo, ( I only remember one malfunction because the others happened when I was an infant, but I just had this gut feeling that something was seriously wrong. It was not even a worry, it was like my body was literally telling me \u201cyour shunt is dying, go get help now!\u201d and I was right. I have only ever had that feeling one other time in 9+ years. You kind of just have to be able to read your body, but if something feels off, talk to your doctor. \n\nAll of the other questions should be addressed to your doctor. I can tell you my thoughts and experiences but I do not want to give you false info. I got a shunt infection shortly after initial placement so had to be replaced etc, can I ask how you got one several years later? Probably failed I am in a rush today because, I am helping people move, but you should did not get in touch with me. \nI power lifted in high school and now I train jujitsu, I have had a shunt since age 10 \n\nA shunt does not have to fully restrict your lifestyle. I have been aware of the presence of my shunt on occasion while doing high intensity activity but it is never been an issue and no neurosurgeon has ever told me to avoid those types of activities.  Personally, I am do not lift weights but I mountain bike regularly and have recently taken up boxing with a heavy bag.\n\nStaying physically active and maintaining a healthy level of fitness is going to be better for the shunt.  My neurosurgeon has told me that the patients he sees the most are overweight and have issues because of fat squeezing the shunt tubing. I meant could the cyst turn into a tumor what cyst? The cyst in my head... that is connected to my shunt? Is that not what hydrocephalus is? Hydrocephalus is a buildup of an excess of the cerebrospinal fluid that your body creates naturally.\n\nEDIT: ( shows it better. Oh weird I am sorry I was told it was a cyst kind of confused now lmao ( link's 'overview' section says that cysts and hydro can be treated in similar ways. that being said, i have no idea if it could become a tumor.", "VP shunt revision update Link to original post: \n\nSo my surgery was Friday. Everything went well! It turns out they had to replace all of my old distal catheter since they found out through some x-rays that there were several breaks in it, so simply re-connecting the catheter to the valve would not have worked. They also replaced the valve itself. I was initially told the day before surgery by my old neuro's PA that they would be leaving the old tubing in, as most of it is probably really scarred in from being in there for over two decades. When I woke up, I was surprised and happy to hear that my neurosurgeon was able to remove 75% of the old tubing! Only some of it remains near my neck and clavicle. I think I can feel it if I press down into the skin deep enough, but I am not certain. He was even able to make his incisions directly over the old ones, so hopefully no new scars once everything is all done and healed!\n\nAs far as anesthesia goes, I do not remember jack, which is a wonderful thing! I remember being wheeled into the OR, and one of the anesthesiologists was making small talk, asking me what my favorite movie was, and my favorite bands. I gave him answers, and that is all I remember happening for sure. He may have said \"Alright, now here comes the sleepy medicine\" or something along those lines, but that could have also just been a figment of my imagination. Who knows. Next thing I remember was being wheeled down to recovery, wondering why my head felt odd laying on it. Was obviously from the big bandage they put over my incision.\n\nStayed overnight Friday into Saturday. Came back home Saturday afternoon. My pain/soreness has subsided greatly, so I probably could have went back to school today, but I thought I would take one more day off just to be sure. Plus lazy...\n\nHad a beautiful overnight nurse Friday evening into Saturday. It felt great having a girl my age care about my not getting much sleep or how I am doing recovery-wise. Asked her for her number, she said she could not give it out because policy, which I figured would be the case. I was feeling ballsy, I did not care! I hope we cross paths again one day.\n\nI cannot thank you all enough for your efforts to console me before all of this! It really meant a lot to me knowing that there are others out there who have gone through the same thing 10x over, or have had their child experience it, which for a parent I imagine is probably even scarier than going through it yourself. I am so glad it went well! Thanks for updating us, and also thanks because as a parent I do not know about it from the patient side!  That is so awesome to hear! It can be scary, but when things get fixed it is a huge weight off your shoulders  Welcome back! Great to hear you are recovering well! Glad to hear your recovering after reading your first post! ", "Weed with Hydrocephalus I am in college and alot of my classmates smoke weed. They are cool people so I do not think they would pressure me or anything but I was wondering if anyone has smoked weed with Hydrocephalus and if it has affected you or your shunt in any significant way? I have (M25) have a VPL Shunt due to aqueductal stenosis. Smoked weed about 1-2 times per weekend all through college. I personally never had an issue. I would honestly discuss this with your neurosurgeon. Every case is drastically different and they know you beat. It can be an uncomfortable conversation, but better safe than sorry. I use medical cannabis to manage the chronic daily headache that is the nightmare of my existence.  It is the only thing that keeps me sane, by bringing my pain levels down from a 9, to a 7.5. No issues for me.  I am a daily medical user.  Once a day. Nope no issues with it at all I have been using cannabis for over 25 years to help control chronic daily severe headaches with far fewer side effects than all the pharmaceuticals I have taken during that time. Go for it and have fun You need a proper medical examination. I have got a manual VP shunt installed in 2017, been smoking weed every day since 2019. Zero issues. I have had multiple. According to every CT since my last surgery in '03, things are 'normal'.\n\nI have been battling daily 'migraine like' headaches since the mid 90's, have seen multiple neurosurgeons, neurologists, headache specialists, chronic pain doctors, massage therapists, acupuncturists, and others. I have run the gauntlet of everything from OTC headache remedies up to opioids, but given family history and my own addictive tendencies, am avoiding those like the plague.\n\nCannabis is literally the only thing that has given me relief for any extended period of time and not completely shit the bed after 3 months of optimism.  Prior to going the cannabis route, I was taking 7 different meds for a total of about 30 pills a day. Since starting? Zero.  ER trips caused by overbearing pain that did not respond to rescue meds and sent me into a fucking nightmare have decreased from once every couple months to less than 5 visits in the last 5 years. Nearly all hydro patients will suffer from drainage issues.  It sounds like your shunt has had drainage issues for so long now. Do your headache come later in the day,get relief from laying down etc. Once you have slit vents it becomes very difficult to treat. Medication almost certainly will not help at all. There is no treatment for hydro. OCT do not treat the symptoms of a hydro headache. From the second I become conscious in the morning around 8am until I finally pass out exhausted in the hours between 1-4am, every waking moment of my existence is dictated by my capacity to ignore the throbbing nightmare that is the shunt site of the one put in as an adult. I do. No effects at all on my shunt or hydro. Smoke up! I feel the exact same way and every time I go to a GP, neurologist, neurosurgeon they either do not want to acknowledge it at all or just say it is just how it goes with this stuff.  It is exhausting have surgery after surgery after surgery that also comes with it is long list of complications.  Opiates definitely have a time and place but they will mess you up for long term pain management. Smoke the pot, you will be so much better off and happy you did.  I have also enjoyed Kratom for pain (not for everyone), my iceKap is a life saver, theragun, do not forget to stay hydrated and yada yada yada all the things you already know. \u2764\ufe0f stay well, friend I smoked prior to my diagnosis and it REALLY helped my symptoms. I was shunted last September and I have smoked ever since with no issues. I think you would be okay to do it but my advice is always listen to your body - if something feels off then stop and go and seek medical advice.", "UK Hydro Warriors: have you been classified \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d ? A couple of days ago, I received an email saying I am now in the clinically extremely vulnerable category and am entitled to take the vaccine - I have got a VP shunt and my last surgery was about 5 months ago. I wondered if anybody else had also been placed into this category and if they have taken the vaccine? I have a VP shunt as well but I do not think that alone makes me vulnerable. My last surgery was 2+ years ago. I have had the vaccine because I work in healthcare. I would definitely recommend getting it if you are able! In the hospital where I work (inpatient mental health) we have recently had a covid outbreak that was only detected through testing. All of them are older adults in their 70s and 80s - they are testing positive however due to having had their first dose of the vaccine all are completely asymptomatic. Which is a miracle! The vaccine really does work and I have seen it in action this past week or so. :) VP shunt also but last surgery was June 2019 and do not work In a priority group so I am just a 28 year old in terms of list priority I had a VP shunt revision in November 2019, and I got my vaccine last Tuesday.

I took the Pfizer vaccine this January and had my second dose in April. The first dose, I had severe flu and vomiting for two weeks, the second dose was completely fine!", "Hi everyone! My mom (who has hydrocephalus) is doing a project for grad school and would like some responses from parents of children with hydrocephalus! She would like to know what are some fears/concerns you have about your child being in the classroom? She knows about what being the child in the classroom is like, but what is it like for the parent? What are some things you make sure of? My son is almost 5 and attends preschool at a private school for visually impaired children (he also has hydrocephalus, caused by brain bleeds at birth. I am scared of him having a malfunctioning shunt that presents at school and the teacher and staff not knowing what to do or ignoring it. I plan to address this fear by having meetings with them to discuss his needs. I also am afraid that he will have pain caused by the shunt and not be able to tell me. (He is developme tally delayed). My daughter is 13. I have always worried about kids rough housing and her falling and hitting her shunt or getting hit in the head by something (rocks, softballs,etc.). Has he ever had a revision? The reason I ask is that my daughter had a couple well before she could communicate. One malfunction manifested faster than the other, but both took some time to manifest and she definitely presented symptoms. I try to make mental notes of the unique symptoms like sun setting eyes, lethargy and inability to sleep that are fairly unique to hydrocephalus. The perspective definitely helped my fears of surprise malfunction, but I am sure that is kind of hard to convey to another parent. I am a pretty rough person so I was concerned my daughter who has hydrocephalus would be too; she is. I asked our neurosurgeon about your concern me and he he some pretty reassuring knowledge. In his many years he had only seen two cases of shunts broken by a blow. Both cases he said would likely have resulted in skull fractures had the shunt not been placed. Shunts are supposedly very durable! My child is not school aged yet, but I am fully aware of the trepidation I will feel sending her off to school. I feel it whenever I leave her with anyone. I would bet a lot of parents of hydrocephalic children are like me in that the condition of hydrocephalus is just one piece of a high stress postnatal situation that has led to some degree of post traumatic stress syndrome. I worry that I will have separation anxiety and be in heightened state of alertness. I am in the US. My son was not diagnosed until he was 11, which is unusual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had quite a few school problems before he was diagnosed. He was always forgetting things...homework, books, jackets, whatever...between school and home. He would get angry and frustrated at school and rip up his work, kick chairs, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe teachers tried to tell me he had ADHD but I knew he did not. I took him to a doctor to rule out any medical causes of his behavior, but they did not catch his hydrocephalus. I took him to a psychologist for testing for learning disabilities, to rule out ADD, etc. They did not catch his hydrocephalus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo one could provide a reason for his behavior, so we just dealt with it with rewards and consequences, as you would with any poor behavior from a child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he was 11, he was a roller skating rink for a friends birthday party. He fell down and bumped his head. He called me not knowing where he was, who he was with and basically having concussion symptoms. I have never driven so fast in my life to gather him up and take him to the ER.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was sitting behind the technician as they did a CT scan and though I have zero medical training, I knew what I was seeing on that scan was not right. His ventricles were HUGE. Long story, short, he was diagnosed and a shunt placed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had his shunt placed over Christmas break of his fifth grade year. His poor school behavior immediately disappeared. It was pretty astounding. He no longer got frustrated, had a much better memory and got the best grades he ever had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe did well until middle school and he started having memory issues again. The schedule of multiple classes was harder for him to handle. He came up with his own system where he would go to his locker after every class and place his materials in a way so that he would remember to take them home and remember his assignments at the end of the day. This would cause him to be late to class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to get him on special education services in order for them to allow him to go to his locker after every class. It was actually quite a hassle over something that should have been simple, but we got it done. He was fine after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my biggest worry was how he would do academically. I never really worried about him being injured as he was not really a sporty kind of kid anyway. I never really worried about his shunt malfunctioning because it takes time to manifest. I just worried about him getting through school, learning and going on to college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe tried college, but it did not work out. He was having some rather severe issues with his hydrocephalus as a young adult and is now on disability. He is in his 30's. He does work, but part time. He could work full-time but then he would lose his disability status and have no health care (Yay 'Murica) so he limits his hours. \n\nHe is married and does well at life in general. Thank you. That is very reassuring. My son has had a couple of surgeries already. He is only 5. Around 6-7 surgeries. As a parent , I always worry, I have seen how quickly a shunt malfunction can go pear shaped. I often worry that I will not be there while he is in school to help him. \n\nWe often worried about the amount of school work etc. He is taught in his 3rd language at school,but luckily so far , he is quite a smart kid. We are not really worried about him being bullied. Schools in HK are not really like that. \n\nWe just worry about the surgeries and how they will affect him..", "Anyone else ever smell their CSF? 2 years ago I had a brain bleed and had to have  2 drains (temp shunts) put in to drain the fluid and blood\n\nAfter the drains were removed some of the CSF would still leak out if I was coughing or whatever, and run down my neck \n After wiping it off with a tissue I decided to smell it for some reason lol it smelled like bacon bits\n\nAnyone else every bother to smell theirs?

I had an ETV 4 1/2 months ago, I have an existing shunt. The ETV failed and the shunt was turned back on a month after surgery. The shunt was not replaced but during the etv surgery they went in the same incision so said there is a small risk of infection like other surgeries. \n\nFast forward to now, I have had a low grade fever (99.9-100.4) for 2 1/2 weeks. Been to my primary doctor and they cannot figure it out, all blood work is normal, shows no signs of inflammation, etc. All labs were normal. I do not notice any redness near my incision, it looks all healed up and a normal color. \n\nMy PCP said since I have the shunt, follow up w my surgeon to be safe. Well my surgeon said he is not really concerned and does not think its shunt related, said infection this far out from surgery are not super common, and I do not have other symptoms, just the fever.\n\nMy question is, if I had an infection... would I know? or can it be insidious? Whenever I get failure it is obvious because the head pain is specific, but I have luckily never experienced infection so I am not sure, but now since theres no clear sign of this fever like a cold or other infection, I am anxious about it being my shunt. Your surgeon is right, it is been long enough since surgery that your risk of a shunt infection is pretty much nonexistent. However, you can still get other illnesses that have no relation to the shunt/your hydrocephalus. The fever is a sign that your body is fighting off whatever it is, but with how long you have had it, you might not be able to do it alone anymore. I would go back to your PCP, it might be time for antibiotics.", "No shunt for daughter with communicating hydrocephalus Hello! My daughter (4 months old) was recently diagnosed with communicating hydrocephalus. She has no symptoms, her fontanelle is not tense, and she does not show obvious signs of ICP.  We became aware of the potential for hydrocephalus after an increase in head-size.  Developmentally she appears to be where she is supposed to be, with the exception of not lifting her head as would be developmentally appropriate.   \n\n\nCurrently, we our surgeon is not recommending the placement of a shunt. I was curious if anyone else was in a similar situation (either themselves or their children). Namely, not putting in a shunt because the hydrocephalus appears to be controlled. We were! My daughter was diagnosed while I was still pregnant with her based of findings in my 30 week ultrasound. She was monitored with MRIs every 3 months, hearing and vision checks, and constant developmental checks with her doctor. They kept delaying placing the shunt because there was no increase in pressure or developmental issues. When she turned 2, we were officially discharged from the neurology clinic with no treatment whatsoever. She is 4 now and doing absolutely incredible. You would never know there was ever an issue. She starts kindergarten in the fall and is the most brilliant kid ever! I have communicating hydrocephalus. Diagnosed much later, but they will not operate on me since it is well controlled. I did well in school and had nothing more than mild symptoms (until I started falling all the time and getting vertigo). My daughter eventually did have a shunt placed due to her obstructed / non communicating hydrocephalus, but her whole team of doctors did try to avoid it. They were hopeful that the csf build up would clear up on its own but hers did not. Her circumstances were different or hers was acquired from complications of prematurity and not born with it (congenital), but I think treatment is similar. A shunt is in a way forever. Doctors do not want to surgically intervene if they do not absolutely have too, especially on an infant. Living with a shunt means you have to ensure it is functioning properly. Shunts do work well, but if you can live without one it makes life a little easier. Best of luck. I know the endless scans and uncertainty are stressful in a way most people cannot understand. Thank you so much for your response! It just feels good to know that there are other people out there who have got this diagnosis and things have turned out ok. Thank you for your response! It is nice to know that people have gotten this diagnosis and  everything has turned out ok. I am so glad your doing well! I hope my daughter ends up only have minor symptoms! Me too! Hopefully it will be like mine (but better because you know what you are dealing with early!) Yep, me. Diagnosed at 2, now 35 with no shunt. Apparently my CSF is well contained and not causing any issues for the time being. I have regular MRIs to check.

My boyfriend also told me to ask about my bowel movements cuz I have not done #2 at all since my surgery That will take a while. Anesthesia messes with your system.

Should I ask my surgeon before I buy them? Go to the hospital like they said to So I emailed them like my boyfriend said to. She said this is very bad.

Perhaps around your community? I decided I wanted to step it up so I am starting this campaign.\n\n", "Increase in ventricles and fluid immediately after a VP shunt surgery My 7 weeks baby boy had his VP shunt inserted yesterday. Today, 24h hours after the surgery the soft spot feels much softer, which means fluid has started draining. He is doing fine clinically. \n\nHowever, the ultrasound shows a slight increase in ventricles and increase in fluid since before surgery, and the head circumference is up 3mm since yesterday. Doctor is not worried and says these are common effects right after the surgery. \n\nI am low-key freaking that something is wrong, because I was expecting immediate improvements or at least stability in terms of head size and fluid volume. Has anyone been in a similar situation right after the surgery? I would not trust the ultrasound honestly I think he is ok. Will they do an MRI to get a clear picture of his vent sizes? My son's ventricles barely decreased in size after his shunt (he was 18 months and had an etv last yr). But his soft spot is soft and he has no sign of pressure. Your little one probably will take a while for his brain to expand to fill in his ventricles. I am not a Dr, just a hydro mom. I have had hydrocephalus since I was born and about 17-18 surgeries which all ended up taking about a day or two before everything looked normal. It takes time for your brain to adjust to a new way of functioning and in that time you may feel discomfort. What helped me (if your son ever has any issues other than a failure) is, first take any non-medicinal approaches to help any other cause of a headache (non-medicinal is better because certain meds can mask important symptoms and when your in pain you most likely do not want any solvable pain there). Second, drink A LOT of fluids (I have found that dehydration can increase the amount of CSF). Third, if he is under draining lay him at an incline of at least 20 degrees to assist the shunt. Lastly, I do not mean to scare you, but there is the possibility he has normal pressure hydrocephalus which is basically where the ventricles do not enlarge when there is an increase in CSF leading to false scan readings. Although, that probably is not an issue due to the fact they discovered he has hydrocephalus in the first place. Overall, it takes time for the person\u2019s brain to get used to a foreign object doing one of its jobs. A soft fontanel is a great sign! If the doctor is not worried you should follow suit. Ultra sounds (and X-rays) do not always paint the most accurate picture. Ultrasounds main benefit is that they are very invasive. I would suggest not googling your way into a panic attack. One major takeaway I got from having a child stay in the NICU is to ride the wave when things are going smoothly. You have probably spent a lot of time worrying and panicking so you have to take your wins when you get them. My little guy got his gl shunt placed at 6 weeks old. I am assuming the shunt that they put in is programmable!\n\nDo boy worry! This is completely normal. We went back every week for about a month with an MRI every week and it was constantly adjusted until we found the right setting. Let me know if you have any other questions! \n\nHe is 3 years old now! Thank you! Did your son got an ETV because the shunt was not working properly? Was it eventually taken out? Thank you for the tips. He is sleeping on the incline right now, and I will continue with this once we are discharged. I did not know about dehydration - good to keep in mind for when he is older. Ours is not programmable for whatever reason. A weekly MRI sounds like a lot! Glad to know your son\u2019s shunt is working with no issues. Wow that is interesting. Having a non programmable shunt will be be nice. I am surprised though. Did they somehow estimate the shunt specifications by the amount of CSF they pulled out? Do you know the name of the shunt that was placed? That is great, I will be praying for you and your son and that he will feel better soon. So he had an etv first for unexplainable hydrocephalus. A year later turns out it was a brain tumor and when they removed the tumor that surgery compromised his etv so they had to put in a shunt. I was not given any explanations or details about the shunt. I should ask these questions before the discharge though. The doctor who did our operation is the head of the neurosurgery department, so I went with what he thought is best for our little guy. We were offered to participate in some kind of a clinical trial for a new treatment/surgery for hydrocephalus, which I refused, as I do not want to take any chances with a baby that small. Completely understand that decision I would have made the same one. Was your son a preemie or anything? How did they find out about the hydrocephalus? Oh gosh, your boy went through so much. How is he doing now? It is a complication from bacterial meningitis. He was otherwise born healthy and full term. Just a case of bad luck! I am new to all this, and trying to understand how to parent a kid with a shunt. Wow that is bizarre. From what I can tell you they are not much different than normal kids. But make sure you get your child enrolled in any and all kinds of early assistance stuff that you can. High risk follow up/early start. I live in California I am not sure if those are available everywhere but definitely being proactive with all of that stuff. We had someone from the state come out to check on his progress every two weeks for the first 2 years of his life. \n\nFor my little guy the shunt is programmable and if a magnet gets near it then it can change the setting which can be very very bad if it goes unnoticed. He is doing as well as he can! Still going through chemo which is not easy on him but so far it is working great \ud83d\ude4f Wishing all the best to him!! Thank you. Same for you are little guy. The hydrocephalus support group on facebook is very helpful too.", "Can anyone whose shunt has calcified explain the neck pain they had? My distal catheter is calcified especially in my chest area (as of 6 years ago). I am certain the chest pain I experience from is only from the shunt, but I am not so sure about my neck pain. My shunt was not replaced at the time because it is high risk because I have had it for decades, and there is major symptoms that I was not showing, at least not at the time. Legit one of my fears since I was like 5.... I did not realize it was a thing that could happen until I found out it happened to me when I was around 28. Forgive me for the late response, but I just joined. \n\nI am 40F and live in the US. I have had my shunt for 20 years. The neck pain I have been experiencing recently has been unbearable and nearly impossible to describe to others. \n\nI am not sure what the nature of your neck pain is like, but here is the best I can explain mine: it starts at the base of my cranium, at the bottom of my ear. The pain emanates down to my collar bone, and follows the path of the tube. The place where the pain is most Intense is in the \u201ccavern\u201d at the top of my collarbone. It is not a \u201cmuscle ache\u201d; it is not a \u201cstrain\u201d; it is a hot, throbbing, intense, acute pain that does not have a clear source. It is hard even for me to tell exactly where it is coming from. I do not have fibromyalgia, but I have a feeling that what I am experiencing is similar in that it is a) hard to describe or pinpoint, and b) it is not necessarily something that a doctor would take seriously...as in it is all in my head. \n\nNo amount of muscle stretching, movement, rest, heat, ice, or painkillers will do anything to relieve it. Oftentimes, this pain is accompanied by pressure headaches. It will come on gradually and then be horrible for a few days and then go away for a few weeks and then come back. \n\nDoes any of this ring true for you as well? Or am I totally off base? Is yours different, and if so, how?", "Need some help understanding what my dad is going through Hello. Back in August suffered 3 mini strokes and went into somewhat of a coma. While in the hospital he developed pneumonia and could not breathe on his own so the hospital did a tracheotomy. They also said that he had Hydrocephalus starting, but it should resolve on its own. \nSeptember he finally started waking up, but no memory of who anyone was. October he started remembering more and now jump to December. He remembers certain memories but not others. We took him to see a neurologist and they did a CAT scan and said the his ventricles had a lot more fluid then back in August and that he would need a shunt. \nJump to a few days ago, he had the shunt installed. \nHe seems better, he is much more talkative now. Before he only answered by shaking his head yes or no. \nBut the one thing that is concerning is that he still thinks he is back in August. He cannot remember anything that was prior to the shunt being placed in. He is saying, \"Last Tuesday I was home working out and now I cannot walk and have this pain in my head. The hospital did something wrong.\"  \nAny help in understanding this will be great appreciated.  There is a possibility that those memories will not ever come back but he made need counselling to deal with that. To have an understanding that time did pass then. I have a lot of trouble with memory both pre and post op. I still have some blank areas from when I have needed surgery but pushed it and waited. The memories post op normally come back eventually. Everyone is different here though. It could also be to do with the strokes. Have his doctors been told about the memory issues? They were told about the memory issue that was occuring pre surgery, but not about the memory issue post surgery. Make sure they are made aware of it. It may be completely normal but they need to check that. I know what memory loss is normal for me now so if something else happened I would tell my doctors immediately. The first time is hard though because you do not know what is normal for you yet. So thank you for posting this. Been going through a lot with my dad as well who is a 74 year old man who in the last year has been completely debilitated by the effects of the loss of balance from hydrocephalus combined with degenerated discs in his back. He has fallen a number of times and after his last fall he has completely changed. His memory lapses are now almost immediate where as before he was able to remember most things. Anyway, my question is about the procedure he had a month ago which was a lumbar catheter insertion in which the csf was drained from his back via a catheter and then a series of tests were done to see if the drainage had any positive effects on his gait or balance. The neurosurgeon who performed the test says my fathers results were not dramatic enough for him to believe that a shunt would provide him any benefit.\n\nMy question is whether anyone here has had the catheter diagnosis test done, not seen great results, and then subsequently saw much benefit to having a shunt placed anyway.\n\nWe are in no mans land right now because the neurosurgeon says th test results seem to indicate it is not nph but the two neurologist who have done multiple cat scans seem to think the scans clearly show nph.\n\nWe have an appointment for a third opinion now with a group in NYU hospital in NYC but appointment is not until November third. Just looking to see what next steps would be.\n\nThe worst part of all this is that my father, who has always been lovely and good-spirited, has sunk into a terrible depression. \n A lot has happened now since I posted this. Yes the shunt has brought my dad back to normal, but he is suffering from seizures now from the shunt. He only had 3 episodes, but thankfully the doctors put him on anti-seizure medicine before having more.\nYou and your family have to make the decision if you go through the decision with the shunt, there might be risk of infection or have seziures. I believe in exhausting every avenue before giving up. Good luck. Thank you. Any other issues with the memory loss? I know you mentioned he lost memory from august until the shunt was put in. Any other issues with memory since then?\n\nGlad he is doing better, hopefully the anti seizure meds can keep the episodes nonexistent or at least to a minimum.
