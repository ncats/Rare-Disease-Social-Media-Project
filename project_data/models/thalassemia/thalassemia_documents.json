["17 Year old , looking for advice . Please Hi , I was diagnosed w thalassemia once going to the doctor and noticing I was just tired everyday and sleeping in class a lot . It took a while to see a hemotologist and they said I cannot do anything except for a good diet and consistent sleep . It kind of scares me because I feel as though I will not be able to live a life fully and that I have to regress on my ambitions . I have been researching the forums on thalpal and all the posts here for months looking for advice on supplements and diet and I am not sure where to start is it is so much and so confusing , just scared it will get worse when I am older. Im feeling a bit hopeless rn any and all advice is welcome !!! I have known I had thal minor since I was five or something. I have always been a little more tired and such, although as a young kid I was more of an insomniac. It annoys me too that there is not much that can be done, or when doctors tell me \u201cyou are not supposed to have symptoms with thal minor\u201d. Well, clearly my blood test show me as anemic, and so I have symptoms. \n\nAnyway, here is what I have found to help:\n\n-Managing stress and mental health. Being tired was more significantly a problem with anxiety and depression. With therapy and medication I am much better now (currently on lamictal which is helping me a lot). And this has brought me much more energy and I do not need as much sleep.  I find a need 8-9 hours now whereas before I was sleeping 10-12 hours and still tired. \n-PRIORITIZE SLEEP. Sleep deprivation seems to hit me harder. If I only get seven hours of sleep I feel it and it gets worse if I continue. Prioritizing sleep helps me get more done in my day and improve my mood, which in turn helps me have more energy. \n-AEROBIC EXERCISE.  While getting consistent blood tests, I noted that my hemoglobin and hematocrit levels correlated with the number of red blood cells I had. Basically, if my body compensated with more than the normal range for red blood cell count, my anemia reduced. My counts were best when I was running regularly (I was training for a Ragnar race). I probably ran about 10-12 miles per week at that time. So I think aerobic exercise can have the biggest impact on increasing you red blood cell count. \n-Eat healthy is a good one. Make sure you get your veggies in, it seems to help me to have more veggies, protein and fat and less carbs in my meals. My energy stays higher and more consistent and I crash less. People say to eat lots of spinach, I do but I am honestly not sure how much of a difference it makes vs other veggies/just having a balanced diet. \n-folic acid and b12 can help, but sometimes they also seem to make me wired and feel more anxious. I have had mixed results but I am doing folic acid consistently anyway just in case it is helping. \n\nBasically, do everything you can to increase the number of red blood cells to you have (sleep so your body can make them, diet with the vitamins to make them, exercise to promote more production), which seems to compensate for the anemia better. \n\nYou can definitely live a fulfilling life, you just need to not push yourself too hard and make sure you take good care of yourself. I personally am in a great place and have accomplished a lot - I have been traveling, pursuing hobbies such as painting, I am doing great in my career as an engineer, I was very successful and graduated top of my class in college while doing lots of volunteer work and playing intramural sports. Just do not compare your energy and ability with others and focus on pursuing what you want to do within the energy capacity that you have. Pushing yourself occasionally is fine but know that you will need to build in more recovery time after. \n\nSorry for the long-winded response, but this is all the stuff I have learned about managing thal minor over the course of my life.\n\nTLDR: it is more important to take care of your physical and mental health to minimize anemia, which will help you live a fulfilling, accomplished life.\n That is pretty amazing you did all that , what did u do to control stress ? anything you did that really stood out ? appreciate the effort in the response  I am intermedia as well and I am around 10 years older. I have had regular transfusions through my childhood until I had a splenectomy. Then I got a bit better. My doctor prescribed me with hydroxyurea which is good for non-transfusing patients - in my experience it is, to an extent. Could you ask your doctor about it to see if they could possibly prescribe it for you too? PM me if you have other questions. Cheers mate.  Sleep and diet.  I have thal minor, diagnosed at 18.( The doc in rural Hawaii first thought I had Leukemia). 11 years later I feel like I am living pretty well.  I do find I get more tired than other people if I do not eat anything or I am low on sleep.  Eating a bit of meat and a good assortment of veggies daily helps me stay more alert.  Beef liver(calf\u2019s liver is best) is good for a boost when I start feeling consistently tired from lack of exercise or lack of sleep. Thanks, just found this sub 20 minutes ago. You have helped me more with my Thal in 1 post than anyone has in 20 years. Cheers to that Sorry for my delay in response. Big thing is figuring out what really helps me with stress and making sure I make time for it, especially when I feel like I do not have the time. For me, going on walks really helps. Also, therapy/counseling helped a lot to reduce the thoughts that were causing more stress.  Cheers! Glad to hear it was so helpful! Thank you ! I appreciate your response for me it was more getting out of my own head and surrounding myself with good people . Eating good and sleep have seemed to help and I have stopped taking vitamins . I go play basketball at my rec occasionally and just enjoy what I have around me . Again thank you for your words I do appreciate it \ud83d\udda4 So glad to hear you are doing better! I wish you the best in continuing to live a fulfilling life :) Im 17 and thal minor aswell! Sadly i might not be much of help cus as much as ive been trying to do a better diet i just cant seem to keep doing it as i usually eat whatever i want to eat (ofc while still keeping in mind not to eat anything too unhealthy tho)... which might be the reason why im getting so much symptoms XD", "I am wondering if anyone has tried this? I know anemia is differrent from thalassemia ", "Does thalassemia minor affect us with the same severity level ? Or there is some deficiency with is or malabsorption.

Deletions tend to have worse effects than mutations and mutations can vary in how deviated it is from \u201cnormal.\u201d So, yes: even if you have the \u201cminor\u201d form of the disease you can have almost no symptoms at all or you can have more serious symptoms. \n\nTo see how much of whatever you are experiencing is attributable to your thal consider comparing your symptoms to others in your family who do and do not have the same thal gene as you. I was without symptoms and feel good unless i became doing bloodchecks and caring for that i became feel symptoms that i cannot determine if they are psychiatric or somatic. How old are you? Did you suddenly start having symptoms? Did you recently find out you have thal? Im 27 years no i did not suddenly have them but they are kind of weird feeling and sensations that i think can be related to a psychiatric illness and sometimes im free from symptoms about thalassemia minor i have been diagnosed with it since 2017 when after a whole blood count check i notice that i have always hemoglobin slightly decreased 12  normal range for males is between 14 and 18 so then i start searching for the cause until i did hemoglobin electrophoresis which results came with beta thalassemia trait . You are a carrier ? How thalassemia minor affectting you  ?", "Questions on thalassemia This is my first time posting here so any info I can acquire is greatly appreciated. I am 26 years old, black, and was diagnosed with minor thalassemia at the start of the year. As of right now I do not need any treatments and hopefully that does not change as I get older but I worry.\n\nBoth my parents are carriers resulting in my elder sister *(now deceased)* in having it, older brother also has it, and now me. Currently unknown if my younger brother has it as well.\n\n1. Is it rare for thalassemia to show up later in life? My older siblings were diagnosed as infants but I did not find out until now.\n\n2. How common is it to feel so fatigued? I maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle, but it seems like no matter how much I sleep I am still tired and just often find myself lying down instead of actually wanting to do other things. I have insomnia and possibly sleep apnea *(which I will get tested about later on in the year when I can)*. Its a genetic thing you are born with, you can either find out as an infant, or find out about it later in life which seems to be your situation. \n\nAs for the symptoms of thalassemia minor they are varied, sometimes you get none, sometimes you get fatigued from the anemia because you have anemia, or you even no anemia. (There are more symptoms just focusing on what you are asking about.)\n\nEven though fatigue is common, currently until you rule out your sleep problems I would chalk up the fatigue to the sleeping disorders. Though the Thal minor probably does not help the issue.", "yellow skin? I know most folks on this sub are major but I am minor dealing with yellow skin. My hemoglobin is 11 which is good considering it used to  be 9-10. Aside from fatigue and weakness, my skin becomes really yellow and sallow. I know this is not a concern to most people with thal but to me it is because it makes me look sick. Hair loss and dry skin already make me look sick. I do not want to look any sicker. I was told to take magnesium, folic acid, and vitamin e to protect from blood cell turnover. Has anyone dealt with this? What did you do to help wit the symptom?\n\nEdit: I am vegetarian.  I am Beta intermediary. My son freaks out because his skin is pink and flush with color and mine is pale with a yellow tone. It just comes with anemia and could just be your skin tone when anemic.\n\nThat said, your bilirubin count may be high. It is a good idea to have that checked as well as liver function.\n\nAs for dry skin and hair loss.  First, I recommend gold bond diabetic lotion. Second, get a shampoo with tea tree and peppermint.  I do oil treatments with 1/4th of a cup jojoba oil with a few drops of cinnamon oil. I do tea tree if I am itchy and alternate with peppermint oil.  These oils stimulate the scalp and help promote hair growth.\n Surprisingly my bilirubin is in the normal range I think it is 0.4. I thought applying treatments topically did not help hair loss that is caused by anemia or deficiencies. But I guess it never hurts to try. I have been struggling with hair loss for the past 5 years and know I am just tryin to save what I have left. Where do you find cinnamon oil?\n\nThanks for the advice! Well, consider what causes the hair loss. Yeah things like rogain or some such does little,.\n\nWhat causes hair loss is because the cells required do not receive oxygen. If you stimulate the scalp thus promoting blood flow then hair loss is minimized.  Peppermint, tea tree, and cinnamon all have the ability to stimulate your scalp.\n\nYou can buy cinnamon as an essential oil or as a food grade, just google it.  There is a company named Lush which has a solid cinnamon shampoo called, New.  It works just as well I cant use it as it has soduim laurels which give me hives. Also, try to minimize as much stress on your scalp as possible. I keep my hair short and wash every other day.", "I am getting tested for thalassemia in the UK (NHS) - need advice? My mother was diagnosed with thalassemia when she was pregnant with my brother in 1993 She used to tell me that she had a blood disorder but never said there was a genetic component to it so I never thought to get checked. (I do not live in the same country as my family, for context).\n\nMy brother was recently diagnosed last year however and it prompted me to go see a doctor as well. I do not know what type they have, but my brother said that he would been coping with chronic tiredness for years and our doctor that was most likely related. \n\nI went to see a GP here in the UK for a hematology referral; he asked why I was getting tested for thalassemia and I said that my brother and mother both were diagnosed. He asked me to describe my symptoms and I said I would always been very tired and borderline anaemic, and their diagnoses prompted me to check as well.\n\nHe said, \"Well that just sounds like a Vitamin D deficiency\" and sent me off next door for a blood test with Vit D ticked on my sheet.\n\nMy question is - is this normal? I know nothing about thalassemia and my research has not really cleared anything up about how to proceed with getting it diagnosed. I am an expat and not sure how to navigate the medical system here alone. Would a normal blood test reveal whether or not I have thalassemia or do I have to push harder for a specialized test, or a hematology test by a private provider or something? I never knew until I did a 23andme DNA test. Even after that I was not sure what it was until my mom said she was anemic. They found out by doing a blood smear I had to request. It uncovered microcytic anemia for me. From there they order a blood test called a hemoglobin electrophoresis.  That is where they uncover the trait. I managed to get all my blood work done within a couple of weeks. I am not sure how it is in the UK.\n\nRegular doctors will tell you that you will not have symptoms with the trait because they are simply unaware it exists at this point. Not enough research is being done on it unfortunately. At least with a blood smear they can tell if you are anemic or not. \n\nVitamin D deficiency can be tiresome. I have to take it everyday, along with many other things, just to feel like I have any energy.  Since there is no treatment for having the trait you will have to do your own research on what will help you. People on here have been very kind with recommendations that have helped them. What I have learned is to take folic acid, vitamin D, B vitamins and any other essential you may think you need. One thing to avoid is iron, as it has a potential to build up in your organs and cause damage to them. \n\nGood luck! I feel like a normal blood test will show that you have low iron and are anemic and then from there they may actually test you for thalassemia? I am just basing this on the fact that whenever I get a blood test (for something unrelated to thalassemia) the doctor is like \u201cdid you know you have a problem with your iron\u201d.\n\nSo hopefully they will see and take you seriously. The NHS can be super annoying when it comes to talking about thalassemia but they do not really know much about it or have much experience with it. You definitely learn more the more different doctors you visit. \n\nFor example I was told never to take iron in the UK but actually my doctor in Thailand now has prescribed me small doses of iron cause it is pretty low and needs brining up. Depends. It can show the anemia, but you need to look at iron levels and other Vit levels as well. If your anemic and your iron levels are normal then you need to look at blood disorders which a hematologist would be the most helpful with.\n\n It took me 27 years to get diagnosed. I have been anemic since I was 2.\nOff and on through the years, I was diagnosed as having iron deficient anemia. The iron pills never worked. Like your brother I was dealing with constant fatigue. \n\nMy mom was also anemic. Along with my brother. It wasnt until I ASKED why my iron levels were fine on multiple CBCs but I kept being diagnosed as iron deficient that my doctor mentioned that it might be generic. Then I learned my grandma was also anemic. Was diagnosed with Alpha thalassemia trait after two genetic tests and sent to a hematologist. \n\nAnd it is bs that people who carry the trait dont have symptoms. \n\nTl;dr dont take no for an answer. It is your body. You know yourself. If something doesnt feel right demand them look into it. That is crazy - they at least seemed to be proactive about it!! My GP has been utterly useless - I just got blood test results, they told me 'everything is normal' but also that my iron is the same as my vit D and it is been labelled 'insufficient'. AWESOME. I have always known about the anemia - I used to donate blood a lot and they first picked it up when I was 16 and they could not use my blood because it was below a healthy iron score. They asked if I played a lot of sport, which I did, so they just said it was because of that. But I have never had a doctor send me for further testing after that - they have all just said it is normal for women to be anemic and then sent me on my way.\n\nI think I am going to actually push for an actual thal test this time though - it is crazy that I have just been panned off so many times. Okay - that is helpful. And yeah, it totally is!! He said I would not know if I had it because carriers do not have symptoms, so he did not believe me when I described the fatigue.\n\nI just called up my GP for my bloodwork results and they were really unclear about what the results were, so I need to go home and see if I have gotten a letter, and then work out how to follow it up since they seem unlikely to give me a hematology referral.\n\nI have caught myself, much more recently than in years before, taking really long extended naps whenever I get a few hours just to sit still. I have been fatigued since I was a kid, so much so that my brother and I have turned into a bit of a family joke. I feel like I am just pushing for a diagnosis because I need to know if there is an answer for it. That is absolutely ridiculous! I am sorry to hear that.\n\nDefinitely push to find out because it is likely that you will have beta thalassemia. I have haemoglobin H disease which is a beta and I have all your symptoms, low iron, low vitamin d and chronic fatigue. It is likely that you may have it too if your brother does (my sister has it too). \n\nIf your doctor messes you around maybe find a new one? Or have you told them that it runs in the family? Just be as persistent as possible! Maybe they can refer you to a haematology unit at a hospital so that you can have it tested there, they will know more than a GP about thalassemia.", "Thalassemia in both partners.

From what I could find seems that many people felt better adopting a vegan diet. Thanks I can confirm the vegan diet helping enormously. Prior to going vegan, my hemoglobin hovered around 9 and I was passing out monthly. After the switch about 13 years ago, it is consistently been at 11 (just 1 point below the normal range for women). I also have a lot of other health benefits, great cholesterol, easy weight management, clear skin. I would stress a Whole Food Plant Based (WFPB) over a plain 'vegan' diet. One could technically go oreos and beer and be considered 'vegan'. It is worked for me and helped my HGB/HCT numbers. However, if you are going to go down this path, be sure to take B12 supplements and eat enough calories! The biggest mistakes many people make when going vegan is neglecting their B12 and eating sufficient calories, which leads to why many feel sluggish with the diet.

But this time, the haemolysis kept occuring despite receiving new blood.

I switched over to Jadenu (exjade reformulation) and I have not had any problems since then. It seems lots of patients have had similar experiences with Exjade.

You can consult your doctor if they would recommend and prescribe you GPO L-ONE (chelation) which is a tablet form. No fasting gaps like Exjade, etc. \n\nI have tried and it works, good alternative due to Exjade shortage and ridiculous price in Thailand.", "Hey guys .. do you look normal?  I am the same age, and everyone thinks I am around age 20. Maybe it helps because I am Asian, haha. I always thought it makes you look older in a sense cause of the pale skin and dark circles?

I am 27 and I look fairly \"normal\" but I can be mistaken for someone in early 20s. I do think you are referring to having \"Mongloid features\" which is fairly common with Thal Majors. I do not have that but I do have pale skin and I look ashen white around the time my transfusions are due.

I have got diagnosed with thalassemia minor at a young age and the only thing they told me was \"meat is your friend, stay away from iron and deal with it\"\n\nNon of the doctors i go to can give me a clear answer to what i should do or cannot do. also the \"diets\" out there contradict each other with what you can and cannot eat.\n\nIve never really looked into a diet specifically for people with minor, but i few weeks ago i started adding maca (some type of Peruvian root high in iron and copper) ive never had this much energy before, I just felt normal or what having a normal energy lvl should feel like.\n\nLuckily a family member reminded me i have to watch out since it has a lot of iron in it so I quit.\n\nDoes anyone have tips on what i should do ? I have never really cared because I never knew anything else. But the little maca incident sparked my interest. nah, you are fine, nothing to do really:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAvoid taking iron supplements.\n\nBefore having children, check to make sure your partner does not have it as well.\n\nEnjoy life, it should have much impact, perhaps slightly reduced stamina. You should go to a hematologist. They are blood doctors and can take your blood and tell you exactly what your levels are such as hemoglobin. Also get your iron checked. Regular doctors do not know anything. \n\nThe diet thing is contradictory. My doctors personally have told me to avoid iron supplements, but not to avoid iron rich food because I would have to eat so much of it to make any difference, and they do not want me cutting out nutritious food. They only prescribe me folic acid to help with making more blood, and the only food to avoid is fava beans which I have only seen once in my life in an Italian restaurant, so that is not an issue. \n\nI am not a minor, so I do not know how you are feeling, but for me I am always tired, I cannot do cardio, I cannot play contact sports since I have an enlarged spleen, but other than that I live a pretty normal life and you should be able to too The cannot do cardio is an excuse. I do Ironmans with thal minor. My HGB is 10-11. Fitness has changed my life living with thal minor. I get way more energy throughout the day. I am not minor though. I am alpha thal intermediate with a hemoglobin of 8 as baseline. I do agree that I am out of shape and should be exercising more, but I find strength training to be more beneficial than cardio. Otherwise I feel like I am going to throw up from the workout Oh my bad. Alpha is a different story. Sorry if that came off as mean. No you are fine. I did not really say which type I have in my original post. It is great that you can do exercise and it has helped you in your life! Go to a hemotologist and get treatment, not Reddit. I am a vegetarian since 2014 and have minor. I am doing just fine without meat \ud83d\ude01. Yeah I am going to book an appointment with a hematologist, I am assuming my tiredness has multiple causes i should look into then just thal minor. This is the correct answer. Also sports with a lot. Crazy how you can do Ironmans.\n\nI have beta thal minor and have always been fatigued, even as a kid.\n\nthe last 10 years have been a nightmare. I always get sick, always tired and fatigued.\n\nI have done countless blood tests and my HGB comes back 11-12. Everything else is fine.\n\nHow were you as a kid? I was always the one who would run out of breath the first. I am not winning these things. I just do them. I take a lot of supplements not sure if they help. I think Folic acid &amp; wheatgrass shots make a difference for myself. were you normal as a kid/teenager? Always tired And how do you feel today? \n\nI mean you must have endless energy if you are doing ironmans lol In my experience doctors are mostly idiots Sorry your experience has been so negative. Our experience has been quite good. I suppose it is like any people, some are idiots and some are not. Eat the Maca.  Thal minor alone does not require dietary restrictions.  You felt better and had more energy after eating it - why would you stop?  Because \u201cluckily\u201d a family member told you to?   The family member is wrong. Iron deficiency anaemia and thalassemia trait are two different conditions. About 1/3 of those with thalassemia trait have iron deficiency. Besides a complete blood count, the doctor should be running an iron panel which consists of iron serum, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation and ferritin. Other causes of anaemia can include B2, B12, folate, zinc etc deficiency.\n\nMany people are also surprisingly deficient in vitamin D. The test is known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D.\n\nThere average ferritin of a person with thalassemia trait is 205.5ng/mL. Clinical iron deficiency is defined as &lt;20ng/mL for females, &lt;30ng/mL for males, &lt;100ng/mL for both sexes and has to show a response to iron supplemention. A 1.0g/dL increase in haemoglobin after six weeks is considered to be successful.\n\nThere are 1846 entries in the database of Human Hemoglobin Variants and Thalassemias. \n\nExercise does help those with thalassemia trait, non transfusion dependant thalassemia (intermedia) as well as transfusion dependant thalassemia (major).

Hi I was recently told I had Thalassemia but am confused. My RBC is 5.32 which is high not low. And my MCV is 75.6 and MCH is 24.4 and I understand these two are low. How can I have thalassemia with a high RBC and normal HGB (13.0)? I understood thalassmia to mean both RBC and HGB should be low? \n\nI was also wondering if Thalassemia goes in hand in hand with anemia? Do I have anemia? My dr said I do not but I am also confused about this...\n\nI have at most mild symptoms. My hands and feet are always cold, pale, and sometimes get unusually out of breath on hikes. \n\nMy dr was not much help and I was hoping someone had a similar experience. Beta thalassemia minor often has elevated rbc. Thalassemia minor is really not a big deal and for the most part will not impact your life. Thalassemia can cause anemia but it does not always. I am not your doctor or a doctor but having normal hemoglobin means you are not anemic to my knowledge. thank you so much for the reply, it is helpful! Is low hemoglobin often then associated with anemia? High RBC is typical in thal minor as is low MCV and MCH...basically the size/volume of the blood cells (MCV) are smaller than regular blood cells and there are more red blood cells (RBC) in the body. This is different than anemia, which has to do with iron levels. It is usual to have thalassemia but not anemia (low iron). I have Dominant Beta Thalassemia (which pretty much presents like Beta Thalassemia Intermedia) and my RBC is usually elevated too, especially during a hemolytic crisis. My hemoglobin is also usually normal, unless the crisis is a severe one. The lowest it is dropped down to is 8. My haptoglobin levels and peripheral blood smear tests are more insightful as to what is going on with me, hematological wise. Thalassemia is new to me and I am still educating myself. This database has really helped me out:\n\n Anemia does NOT have to do with low iron. This is a misconception because there is a type of anemia called iron deficient anemia but not ALL anemias are caused by low iron. I have alpha that hemoglobin H with CS, and I have TOO MUCH iron from lots of blood transfusions. Does that mean I have a lot of energy and can do a lot of physical activity? No. I feel the same as when I had normal iron levels which is always tired and going up stairs make me fatigued. We are anemic from a low amount of oxygen in our bloodstream to our organs. I am not a doctor so I do not know exactly what causes anemia in thalassemia but it is not from iron levels Yup! I understand, but usually when one mentions anemia to their doctor (without additional info provided or dr does not know one\u2019s medical history), the dr assumes it is iron deficiency anemia even though there is so many types of anemias. If I am not mistaken, OP mentioned they have thal minor (thalassemia is a type of anemia!) but does not have anemia (per what dr told them)..it is safe to assume the \u2018not anemia\u2019 comment means the iron deficient anemia is meant. It is frustrating that is what is usually meant when just the word anemia is mentioned. You said your anemia has you with too much iron from the blood transfusions; with Thal b minor,  the blood cells are a smaller size than normal and there are more rbc\u2019s in the bloodstream. Thalassemia is a type of anemia, just not the iron deficient type of anemia. It is best we do not intake much iron for our anemia. That Is true the low amount of oxygen in the blood cells is what being anemic is about and keeping us tired. You have the best version of thalassemia minor do not you just a carrier with mild symptoms like you described anyway make sure your partner or you will have 25 % chance to have a sick kid with the bad version of thalassemia. Thank you for the reassurance! Are you able to tell from this if it is alpha or beta? In the minor case they are the same in the whole blood count you need to show me you hemoglobin electrophoresis to see the presence of which hemoglobin you got anyway it will be written in the result paper below of your hemoglobin electrophoresis. Hi! This is also my case (26F). I have been diagnosed with Alpha Thalassemia trait (mild) last 2019. RBC is constantly higher than normal (until now). But MCV and MCH is low. No problem with Hemoglobin as well. As far as I remember, my Hematologist also mentioned microcytosis (smaller RBC than normal) is common in thalassemia trait. I have not been able to have a follow up check up, but she did not mention any medications needed for my situation. Hi! I was wondering what makes it thalassemia alpha in your case rather than beta? Do you experience any symptoms? You know what, I am honestly not sure as well \ud83d\ude05 When I was diagnosed, I did not really think about then because I was not experiencing any symptoms. But my Hemoglobin Electrophoresis showed that there is a decrease in my Hb A (96.7%) and traces of Hb F (0.6%).

There is nothing we can do either way except take care of ourselves. \n\n:) Malaria =/= Ncov19. We are not immune to it nor do we have resistance to it.\n\nDue to our naturally low HGB/HCT and how this particular pneumonia flu attacks our lungs specifically.

I know this is not *suppose* to cause symptoms, but apparently, my chronic, unrelenting coldness says otherwise. If I am not actively being active, I start to get so cold, I cannot function. This is a problem, because it interferes with my daily life, both at work and my social life.\n\nAt work, in order to tolerate my air conditioned office, I have to wrap myself in an electric blanket all day. Meetings are miserable, because I cannot always take the blanket with me. I am so cold, I cannot think about anything else or work.\n\nEver since I could afford to live in apartments/houses that even *have* air conditioning, I have been in endless fights with my roommates about the thermostat, because their maximum tolerable temperature is colder than my minimum tolerable temperature. For this reason, I *need* to live alone, whether I want to or not.\n\nMy social life suffers similarly. I avoid visiting friends, because I cannot stand how frigid their homes are. Similarly, they find my apartment sweltering, despite it being as cold as I can tolerate.\n\nEven with all this, even when I am in my supposedly warm apartment, my thermometer-clock will confirm that my central heating is working at 78\u00b0F, I will still be overcome with a wave of coldness that I cannot relieve. Not even completely cocooned inside an electric blanket on its highest setting. It will usually last for half an hour to three hours before I finally am able to rejoin the land of the living.\n\nI was talking with a friend the other day who recently had her chronic anemia cured with a hysterectomy, and her coldness went away as soon as she got rid of the anemia. Apparently all those are a direct result of anemia, but I am not anemic beyond what is caused by my beta thalassemia minor, and beta thalassemia minor is supposed to be asymptomatic. What can I do about it? Last year, when I asked my doctor about what I can do about being cold all the time, she shrugged it off as some people just run colder than others. I cannot go on living like this. Something needs to change. I also \u201crun cold,\u201d along with my mum and grandma (who have the trait) and my aunt (who does not).

Drinking lots of water and eating smaller, more frequent meals can also help (large meals will draw blood to your digestive system, away from your extremities). I like to sip on hot tea from a thermos during the day. \n\nI also live with someone who cannot tolerate the thermostat being up where it is comfortable for me, and I live in Canada, so I have gotten good at layering for warmth. Two pairs of socks. An undershirt, regular shirt, and sweater. I sometimes wear a circle scarf at work. Thermal leggings/tights under leggings or jeans. Conserve what little heat you have! Thalassemia Intermedia here. Have you tried having warm or hot tea or water where you get cold? Tea is great cause antioxidants/iron chelation benefits and it will warm you up from the inside. \n\nSorry you are going through this friend, stay strong. If you regularly take your folic acid it should help. I drink warm water and hot tea all day long at work When I am at work I layer a lot. Still freezing, though. Wool thermal underwear under my shirt/jeans, wool socks, hoodie. I am not underweight. I am just about where I should theoretically be. I have a blanket I take with me to meetings, but it is not electric, so it is not helping me actually produce warmth. More layers/blanket just seems to buy me time, but I still get too cold if the meeting is more than a few minutes, and at some point, the bulk and weight of the extra clothing becomes a burden itself. I sip on hot herbal (usually chamomile or ginger) tea and warm water all day and have to pee frequently as a result. Are you on any medications that may be constricting blood vessels? Not a thal thing, but some meds are known for this/numbness/Raynaud's Syndrome being a side effect. Nothing. I will occasionally take Ibuprofen, but that is it. I have a similar issue. I noticed my normal body temperature is about one degree lower than average. What sort of temperatures can you tolerate? If I am not active, 78\u00b0F to about 100\u00b0F\nIf I am actively moving around, it depends on my level of exertion, but adequately bundled up, as long as I keep moving, I can comfortably take a brisk walk as low as 60\u00b0F. As soon as I stop, though, the chill catches up. You are not alone. Fortunately I live in the tropics and have ambient temperatures of 25-35 Celsius (77-95 fahrenheit) all-year round.

This year I was diagnosed with alpha thalassemia minor, which explained a lot about the symptoms I was experiencing. But as of recently (past 2 months), the fatigue has gotten pretty bad where there is days I just feel like I am going to pass out or have fainting spells. I have been experiencing pretty bad brain fog as well where I will easily forget things even if it just happened recently. I have incorporated exercise such as weight lifting in the past year and a half, and I eat a pretty balanced diet (no restrictions). Recent blood work does show a dip in my hemoglobin levels than from a few months ago but nothing too crazy. I just do not know why the symptoms have gotten really bad these past two months. Anyone have any tips on how to deal with all this? Does fatigue and braing fog occur after meals? I have similar symptoms when I overeat protein. When I eat around 20g of protein for meal, I am ok. But I try to not eat more in one sitting. I have not really noticed how I have been feeling after a meal but I will definitely be more mindful of how I feel going forward. Typically I will eat both a high carb and high protein breakfast (~24 g of protein). But this does not happen everyday. I am a doctor (who also has thalassemia minor) and you will probably not like what I am about to say.  \n  \nIt is incredibly unlikely that the main cause of your fatigue and brain fog are due exclusively to your diagnosis of thalassemia trait.  \n  \nThere is a very real effect known as the nocebo effect (opposite to placebo). It is a real, and measurable effect. It is not \"just in your head\" however. Your negative feelings towards your diagnosis might stem from your mind, but the effects on the body are real.  \n  \nNow, without seeing your bloodwork, and doing a physical workup on you, I cannot in good conscience give any kind of real advice besides going to see your own doctor and discussing it with them. If they will not/cannot help, request to see a hematologist if you are able to.  \n  \nThere might be some other issues that combined with the thalassemia minor might be causing issue, but again, the best thing you can do is talk to a hemotologist or your doctor about it.  \n  \nTry not to feel too bad about having thalassemia minor, by itself, it is not supposed to be able to cause such large issues. And hey, you are resistant to malaria and other similar blood borne pathogens! Woohoo! Besides malaria, what other pathogens are we resistant to? I have been trying to look it up. Too many carbs spike my blood sugar and make me sleepy. The glycemic index for wheat is very high. I guess everyone is different. I think you might have to elaborate on the fatigue.\n\nI spent over a year with my hemoglobin below 8 and have seen a low as 3's. Fatigue is not stranger to me but it should go away when back in proper levels. As far as brain fog, I cannot say im following I noticed tiredness with overeating carbs. We have the same condition. I always take B12 and folic acid in the morning and at night Due to excess red cells breakdown in middle age, and overlarge spleen and liver being stressed and tired, my digestive tract cannot digest protein. The globulin from the dead red cells is sent back my kidneys forming \"uric acid\" in my case. Underactive thyroid acts another complicated character. Nitric oxide levels keep going lower with age.", "New member (Thal Minor) Hey thalassemia subreddit!\n\nI am 21 years old, turning 22 in a month. I have thalassemia minor because my father is thal minor too. My parents had told me as a kid that I have thalassemia but it is not a big deal to worry about. We do not talk much about it and I just continue with my daily life. Hence, I do not even know if it is alpha or beta. I play sports and have not felt tired or unfit, but I do notice that at times I cannot reach to the fitness level and stamina of some players (But I suspect that is because of my lack of cardio and more of weight training). My parents have only warned me about getting a wife who has thalassemia too, cuz that would really affect the baby. Apart from that, I continue living an absolutely normal life. Now my question is, should there be something I should change in my eating habits for long term good health? Because I have no clue.\n\nAlso, my blood group is O -ve and because of that I made a promise to myself to donate blood at least once every six months. However, I have tried donating blood 4 times and every time they said my hemoglobin is too low. In fact, once a 'not so professional' was running the preliminary test and asked me about any conditions... I said I am thal minor and he looked at me in shock as if I had touched him with some contagious flesh eating virus! He then said I am never allowed to donate blood and that if I do, I will need a transfusion. So that time I was a little hurt and disappointed. \n\nSo I asked my uncle who is a hematologist and he told me that I have nothing to worry about and if I am healthy I can very well donate blood! He encouraged me to do so cuz I am a universal donor. Thal minor will not 'infect' the receiver, it is just regular blood after all but with slightly less hemoglobin! Have any of you tried donating blood ever? \n\nWould appreciate your inputs. Thank you :) While individual mileage may vary, you are pretty spot-on with all your statements and understanding.  Yes you can donate blood if your hemoglobin is high enough, though as you have seen, it rarely is.\n\nYou may consider cutting back on red meats and avoiding iron in general, we often tend to develop hepatic iron overload in time and there is no real treatment for that. Hey thanks for your reply!\n\nI am vegetarian, but still I have not paid much attention to my eating habits. Also, how do I know if I am alpha or beta thalassemia? I guess my cautionary note is really to watch that iron intake, you can get a lot of that in spinach and some other veg as well.  A good question on alpha vs. beta, i am not sure the answer, perhaps that warrants its own post to ask others...? Alright I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your response :) I have alpha thal HgH CS and my college used to do blood drives all the time and give out free food if you donate. I always wanted to, but I always assumed I would not be able to because I have thal. My hemoglobin is 8 baseline, and even if I did not have thal, I do not weight enough at 92lbs and I am 4\u201910\u201d. My blood type is O+ so I can take either types of O when I get transfusions Hey, I know it is really hard for us to have the appropriate hemoglobin level. I am O-ve so imagine how helpful my blood would be to someone in need. But I just cannot donate it, it makes me sad sometimes :( Beware that your red blood cells only live about 30 days and not 90 days as normal people.\n\nThal Minors should never donate blood.\n\nThe reduced lifespan could be deadly for the blood recipient. Oh shoots! So I guess my blood would be useful only in rare emergency situations :( I think I had electrophoresis blood test done (was having fatigue and my Hb was consistently 7-.7.4 despite taking iron supplements, when my doctors suggested to get this test done, thinking I might have sickle cell disease, which I do not have but found out about Beta Thalassemia Minor that I do have, haematologist ordered the same test to confirm it again). You can visit any haematologist and they will help you finding out. \n\nAs said by others, if you face iron deficiency, it is better to ask a haematologist first. I had low iron and when it was not known I had BTM, was prescribed iron for months. Then after finding out, my haematologist ordered many other blood tests, where it was found my Ferritin levels were 3.81 times the normal and it was causing me problems and iron supplements were infact adding fuel to fire. Hence, it is better to consult a haematologist before taking iron supplements.\n\nOther than that, I was prescribed folic acid supplements in general for a few months.", "Diet for thal minor and are there foods to avoid?

And that not confirm that if you have beta thalassemia minor you will develop bipolar disorder.  And this hypothesis its about beta thalassemia not alpha thalassemia. I wonder which one you got..

It is an incredibly rare condition but curious as to the range of symptoms you experience. ", "Dating someone with Thalassemia Major - what should I know? My boyfriend has Thalassemia Major and although he has briefed me and I have done my own research, I would love to receive some advice from the community. His health and well-being are important to me. \n\nWhat should I know? What can I expect? Any advice? What would you want your partner to know or understand about you?\n\nAny advice is appreciated! Thank you! If you plan to have baby also get yourself checked for thalasermia I would say be there for them both physically and emotionally. If they have major then they will be in the hospital a lot getting blood transfusions which takes a couple hours. I have intermedia, so I only have to get transfusions maybe once a year, but it is nice having someone there to sit with you while it is happening. It is also nice to have someone to talk to about my feelings since I can often feel lonely or angry that I have this condition, so being empathetic and providing an ear to listen while I vent is nice Before all else, I commend you for taking the initiative to understanding the illness. Your bf is very lucky to have found you. Although, living with Thal is physically and emotionally taxing for the person and the people around them. We live pretty normal lives. The key things to living, a long and healthy live with Thal are taking meds, blood transfusion if needed, exercise, and a responsible diet. Most time, we fear of dying and just having someone to listen, being there mentally and physically makes a world of a difference. Like anyone, we are extra hard on ourselves, so being irrational and judemental can be detrimental and decreases the quality of our life. We just need someone to be empathic while we are in constant and unexplainable pain. Lastly, if you want to start a family, get genetic testing and do not let anyone tell you anything otherwise, it is still your decision in the end. Be honest with yourselves. I have been with my partner for 11 years and we are living our best lives together! I wish all the love and glory for you and your bf! Cheers\ud83d\udc95 Once a year is almost nothing, one could almost forget they are special but I can totally understand you feeling down seeing others not needing it at all. God bless you. He is a Major so he would be getting a lot of transfusions, that is the most demanding part so never be dull about that if you are going with him. Take it as an opportunity to talk about whatever, watch TV if possible ONLY if he does not want to rest. Just look forward to it, never let him get the impression that you wish he was normal. Thank you. I know once a year might not seem like anything for thal majors who need transfusions every 3-4 weeks, but one time I got really sick and needed 4 units of blood in 4 weeks. And more recently I had an episode where blood did not help because my body was hemolyzing and had to take corticosteroids to suppress my immune system since my hemoglobin was down to 4-5 Yeah, when we are sick it falls down like gravity xD.", "CURE for Thalassemia, BUT can u afford it??  Zynteglo was manufactured by using CRISPR technology , crispr-cas9 (search in google) and by both vertex pharma and crirpr pharma. But sad thing is that they have priced the drug so high (1.8 million $)that only a few 100 can afford. there must be a way we can manufacture it for cheaper Chinese can reverse engineer it but I guess they will not as they are already taking the heat from covid . or we can do a heist Some are doing it in home which is way more dangerous, watch in YouTube, CRISPR home dna or something. thank you! Imagine discovering a cure but is not accessible to everyone. This is almost the same as selling expensive insulin in the us. How sad. Ways to kill people/reduce population, first u experiment with atom bomb, let the after effects follow, then price it so high none can afford. Whom to blame?? Europe itself told to reduce prices but the drug maker took it off the shelf for 6 months, again launching at same price. They needed the population to to their dirty jobs so covid vaccine is free/less pricey otherwise it would have been way costlier too. If covid vaccine can be made why not these?? Why kill the hope of people for the sake of profit?? There might be a generic in 20 years after the patent expires I will have seven kids by then. powers: super thalassemia It sounds like it is that expensive because it requires stem cells from the patient. Normal using blood collection. Probably a 1000 bucks at max It is probably expensive because of supply and demand and a dash of greed? Thalassemia is pretty rare and a lot of people with minor never realize it. Thalassemia affects\u00a0approximately 4.4 out of every 10,000 live births\u00a0throughout the world. This condition causes both males and females to inherit the relevant gene mutations equally because it follows an autosomal pattern of inheritance with no preference for gender.\nIt is not rare, the patients die before the census reaches to count the population. Google disagrees and says it is rare. Fewer than 200k cases a year. It is not rare in Asian and European region. Search wiki. It is a burden in blood banks. It is rare globally. Why are.you arguing semantics Cancer is rare too but do not you think that the price for the cure is not justified?? My reason of argument. Cancer is not rare Snake bite is, why the cure then? Snake bites are not a disease lmfao and they do not need a cure, they take antivenom for venomous bites. It is a completely different thing that is not comparable. you are just throwing random shit now because you are mad you are wrong.\n\nOur disease is rare. It sucks but we got to deal with it. Hopefully the cure gets more affordable with time. My boyfriend has cystic fibrosis and they only just got some good treatments that let him live a normal life and that shits expensive as fuck. He is on some medical version of a scholarship to afford it but he went his whole life without it before it became a thing. \nJust be patient, pray, and vote for free healthcare in your country. Ur damn right I am mad not because I am wrong but because I feel a cure is a cure, no need to suppress a cure and justify the causes. If the bulb and electricity was suppressed we would have been living in stone age. Those people did not do it for greed, neither justified the high prices. 1.6 million for a vial of meds is never justified in today's world. You can support the pharma companies because your guy got the scholarship to medical care, the day you do not, you will understand the pain the patient and family members have to bear.\nFree?? If anything is free in this world is oxygen and corruption. Oh my god why are you complaining to me as though I have any fucking control over it? All I did was comment suggesting supply and demand is the reason because like it or not we are not the priority compared to more pevelant diseases.\nI did not fucking disagree with anything you said other than your wrong assertion that thal is not rare. Beta-thalassemia is the most common hereditary disease in Iran. More than two million carriers of beta- thalassemia live in Iran. 2 mil in just Iran , how big is that country?? You think it is rare ?? Worldwide, 15 million people have clinically apparent thalassemic disorders. Reportedly, there are\u00a0about 240 million\u00a0carriers of \u03b2-thalassemia worldwide, and in India alone, the number is approximately 30 million with a mean prevalence of 3.3%(2,3).  2015? It is 2021 dude. Fail harder. Yearly cases are what matter for determining rarity of a disease. Yearly reporting is what determines rarity. \n\nYou are still arguing this?

Does this look like thalassemia ", "Please give me some advice guys Lately I have been having chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue&amp; my hair is falling out. I went to the doctor &amp; they said im anemic. I bought some liquid iron&amp; vit D to try and fix these problems but my mom said the liquid iron is essentially useless since i have thalassemia. \n\nCan I still try and get iron from food? Am I supposed to keep dealing with the hairloss? What vitamins should I take? I have not really felt the effects of thalassemia until now and I am 17 I would get a second opinion.   Yes, we tend to be anemic, that just comes with the territory and is not a problem.\n\nAside from fatigue, what you are describing does not sound consistent with thal, and there may be something else going on there.\n\nFinally, do not take iron supplements, it will not help, and will actually do harm Depends on your iron levels from your bloodwork. If it is within normal range, as it usually is for Thalassemia people, then you do not need more. If the bloodwork says you are low and dr suggest it, then it might help. Obviously do not know where you are in the world, but if you have good access to healthcare, I would ask your doctor to refer you for some blood testing. I pretty much knew I had an anemia of sorts from the first time my doctor brought it up, but the blood testing really helps to specify what exactly you are lacking. Not everyone who has a red blood cell deficiency needs to take iron pills. For instance, me and both of my sisters have red blood cell deficiencies, but my older sister is the only one out of the three of us who is presently taking iron pills. \n\nAlso, if there is a way you can get a referral for a hematologist from your doctor, they can definitely do more testing/possibly give you more specifically prescribed medication that your doctor might not think to give. \n\nI know it is easy to worry about something like this, but do not fret too much! Anemia is definitely treatable and there is a lot of information/specialists out there who can help you achieve what you need. Good luck and let us know how it goes! :) Yeah depending on the type/severity of your thalassemia and whether you get blood transfusions it may be possible to be iron deficient but before starting iron replacement you should see a doctor to get iron/ferritin levels checks and get them rechecked frequently if you are taking iron I have been having the chest pain and shortness of breath a bit but I think that is because I am pretty sure I had covid in January 2020 (before it started making the news and before shutdowns) and my chest just never recovered and lately it is just been hard to breathe from a mix of being out of shape and the humidity near me (Its always been hard for me to breathe in it but just especially so right now).   \nI would not rule out that you could be sick.

I started running a few years back and could not really make much progress with stamina improvement (but it is not too bad since I managed a 26k), but something I have noticed is that when I am running or cycling or doing something stamina related, once I feel short of breath it is usually too late and if I stop right then, it progressively gets worse and harder and harder to breathe like a delayed wave. I found out from a bunch of friends who also run that when they feel out of breath and stop, it starts getting better immediately and there is no delayed wave. Was just wondering if the delay for me might be caused by beta thal minor? I hear sometimes there are not even symptoms in carriers...or do other regular folks have delayed waves too and I just do not know them?? my thal is generally not noticeable, but boy, running is one thing that i just cannot do, i do not even try anymore I cannot speak to the medical specifics, but I also have beta thal minor and have had the same experience. If it helps, I have changed my fitness habits to things that do not require cardio, like weightlifting and martial arts. \n\nI have totally given up on running. I have done a 10k just to prove to myself that I could, but it was effin' misery.\n\nThe problem with thal is that your blood carries half as much oxygen as people without thal. Even in your best physical shape, you will always have half as much oxygen in the tank as anyone else. I feel ya. I have been doing martial arts and weightlifting since I was a kid but decided to start running a couple years ago with some of my martial arts mates. Cardio just kills me but I also feel like I should work on it slowly because of that. My semi-regular 5k run results vary quite a lot too because of my pacing is just a little off I will really suffer the consequences. running is one of the most noticeable things for me, it is crazy when i look back at when i was younger (19 now, diagnosed at 17) and i was playing soccer at the highest level and was in the best shape of my life but i could still never compete with my teammates when it came to running. Yeah, martial arts can be interesting with thal. I am curious about your experience. I have found that I absolutely *have to* win the match in about 3 minutes, or else I am a wreck that can barely keep on his feet. It is turned me into a very aggressive player, for better or worse.  I have always had bad stamina (although I did not attribute it to thal then), so I just paced myself or saved up short bursts of energy for when I needed them but I would always have a problem getting my breath back from those. Same deal with basketball\u2014I could not accelerate excessively or else I would be dead for the rest of the game. With decent pacing I can go on for a long time though. This is so comforting to see.

How do you guys do it my iron is extremely low You do not IMO, just I am getting transfusions and taking my deferasirox until my organs give or I die somehow. But at least live your life to the fullest lol That is interesting, I was told by my doctor to just take supplements that are not that strong for a short period of time. Surely they would not kill you if it is moderate? My doctor said it \u201ccan\u201d kill you or atleast damage your liver overtime, another doctor told me it is fine but to avoid the infusion. I do not know who to believe or what to do to bring it up safely without damage Eating food with iron (red meat for example) with orange juice can increase iron absorption. Coffee or tea will inhibit iron intake. \n\nBut good to check with Dr and also do some blood checks on serum fertitin/iron panel periodically to avoid iron overloading (which can be very bad) You can take iron supplements/infusions. It sounds like your doctor is not familiar with Thalassemia, especially how minors differ from intermedia and majors. I had iron infusions earlier this year - my Ferritin was 3 and I am Beta Thal Minor - and I felt so much better afterward.\n\nBeta Thal minors do not have the same iron restrictions as the intermedia/majors do. And iron only becomes deadly when there is too much of it in the body, which is the case for everyone including those without Thalassemia. Intermedia/majors tend to accumulate too much iron from blood infusions and/or increased iron absorption. Minors do not require blood infusions and increased iron absorption is a rare problem, so it is a myth (though still pretty common) that we cannot have iron. And since you are iron deficient, it is pretty clear neither of those is a problem for you.\n\nIf you can, find a doctor familiar with Thalassemia.", "Where do you live?

Where do you live? America and do not have the usual text book background that usually indicates the disorder. No asian or Mediterranean or middle east ancestry at all, its all Scandinavian/northern european so most doctors give wtf looks when they realize its a fluke in my family.

Asia,SG What about your  parents Neither got in depth testing for it, but my mother and my fathers sister seem to have the same symptoms I do so it seems to be both sides, though they have no idea which has which. Testing back then was not great.\n\nEdit: meant in depth Now thalassemia in general becomes all around the world . Generally now a days yeah, but it is still more common with certain ancestries and mine is literally the last combo most doctors think of. It also makes any testing elective not automatic since ancestry is a risk factor doctors use to consider whether to test or not. Yeah i see but even in countries with people are susceptible to have this disorder it still rare with a prevalence from 2 to 5 % It also depends on what part of the population they are looking at, some studies specify middle east or african usually. Its very much a one off to find a strictly Caucasian study of the disorder.\n\nEdit: not saying I am super special or anything, just that it is not the most common to find it in people with my combo of genes and ancestry. Sometimes those kinds of disorders are being endemic more than epidemic they tend to be more prevalent in a city or in village than the other places in the same country. I could understand that if my family had been in the area for generations, but they have not we are like 2nd gen in the area and the rest of the family is scattered, we hold no long term ties anywhere until you hit Europe.

It seems like you and a lot of people in this sub are being let down by their physicians. You should not have to go to Reddit to figure out how long you are going to live. There are so many other people here just seeking basic information, which is insane. I am sorry this is the situation.\n\nThe guys on the steroids subreddit seem to have better support from their doctors than we do.\n\nScientific literature seems to be the only available place for a lot of this information and it is not accessible to everyone. I have seen a lot of you on this sub basically become researchers just to figure out wtf is going on with your body.  \n\nEDIT: Sorry for the weird rant. I read this back and it may have seemed angry and targeted at you for asking a question. I am sorry if it came across that way. I am just mad at doctors.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked through some literature regarding life-expectancy and struggled to find current publications that were not examining patients in developing countries. I should not assume, but I am guessing you do not live somewhere where you are 150+ km away from the nearest medical center and you had access to medical care as a child. A lot of these publications collected data in India and some in Iran. Many of the communities sampled were poor and lacked access to reliable medical treatment. It seems like a lot of people die in childhood from a lack of treatment, unscreened blood transfusions, and a lack of timely iron removal. Other factors like illiteracy and lack of education compound these issues. Many people in the studies also suffered from other diseases like hepatitis or had their spleen removed at some point. Interestingly, being married to a blood relative was correlated with beta thalassemia in one study.\n\nAll of this sampling in places with limited healthcare and other poverty-related issues has lowered the estimated age of survival in these studies. I was not able to find a *current* study from the UK or US that provided estimates other than saying life expectancy is improving in both developed and undeveloped countries.\n\nThe studies that have cited life expectancy for developed countries are from 10-15 years ago. In addition, many study subjects were born before early life treatment was common/effective. Some studies also did not consider the severity of the thalassemia (even intermediate vs major), so that is something to keep in mind when reviewing these numbers.\n\nEven with these considerations, some UK studies have showed a rapidly increasing life expectancy due to better prevention of iron overload from treatment.\n\nSorry this is not an answer. I could see people finding the 30 years old number that is thrown around on a lot of websites pretty scary. Especially if their doctor is not giving them all the info. I wanted anyone reading this in the future to know that those numbers most likely are not the answer for people living in developed countries with regular access to medical care.\n\nSources\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n( I am not the OP, but thank you so much for taking the time. \u2764\ufe0f Do you not qualify for a transplant?

Per my hae doc, I am too old for a transplant. Am not aware if there is any bluebird clinical trail in my country. Looks like their phase 3 trials are no longer enrolling. Keep an eye out for when their lentiviral therapy gets approved in the US. It uses a virus to add the correct gene sequence and almost fully reverse the thalassemia.\n\nIt was tested in patients 50 or younger so you might still qualify Thanks for information!! THANK YOU! You basically hit the nail on the head there. Im a beta thal major in my early 30's and continuously face the same issues you brought up. All of them. Honestly half the fight with this disease is getting the proper medical care and support, down to basic fucking information like life expectancy and basic RELEVANT statistics. Anytime I have to transfer medical centers (which I have done a few times), I would have to explain to the MDs and nurses, from scratch, what my treatment plan is, how transfusion days are supposed to go, what medication and specific tests I need along with their time intervals, etc. On top of that I am basically the one informing them of all the new medications being approved like Reblozyl and ongoing gene therapy treatments. The whole thing is incredibly frustrating and fucking exhausting. Mind you I live in a country with first world medical care where thalassemia is relatively common, and even then the knowledge and experience of MDs and even blood specialists is severly lacking. I can ONLY imagine what it is like in other countries. Oh and the research aspect, or lack thereof, is a whole other issue as well. Every paper is at least a couple decades old and very irrelevant with respect to today's medical breakthroughs. Too tired to type my story. Previous posts have great resource links to cooleys anemia (CAF) and TIF, that refers you to updates, current therapies, and patient stories. Before the lockdown, i was able to attend a CAF patient-family conference - research shows that Thal patients are living meaningful and longer life well into their 70s - 80s with the advancement of tech and treatment. Coming conference is in Atlanta, GA later this year, if you get a chance, check it out! I feel like CAF and TIF should be stickied to the top of this sub. They have got excellent resources and support and it feels like almost no one here knows about them. I mention them just about every time I post.", "Anybody Beta Minor and Iron Deficient?

Sadly, I do not have any other tips, and I do not know too much - I was only recently diagnosed with thalassemia. I am, you should not be taking any iron supplements.

Folic acid is used in the production of red blood cells, so even though my folic acid levels were not low, he said taking a supplement just in case would not hurt.  Seconding the folic acid. It is interesting that the reference ranges your lab uses varies so much than mine.\n\nMy hemoglobin and hematocrit are generally around 11 and 35, respectively.

Keeping hydrated enough.\n\nSorry if this is not well articulated, I am super tired, but would like to hear from you I guess. \n\nCheers,\n\nK Followup: should I open up to my group about my diagnosis? Why or why not? Anyone here told their work place about it? I have the same question as you. The main thing that I have found to be helpful with the fatigue is regular swimming. I joined a swimming group at my local gym which keeps me motivated to go, and I have found that the days that I swim the fatigue is less severe than non-swim days. Haha the one time I went hiking I passed out so I am never doing that again.\n\nBut, I do understand where you are coming from. Whether it is just getting out of the bed in the morning or just walking up the stairs, I honestly always feel so mentally and physically exhausted. I never used to feel this way  in high school, but now that I am in university and I work a part time job, I find it much more difficult to do day-to-day things. However that being said, I do not take any supplements, like folic acid, and I do not regularly exercise which could be part of the problem. \n\nI think that you did the right thing by letting your supervisor know. However it does suck that thalassemia is not \u201cwell-known\u201d. \n\nI wish you best of luck on your schooling, future Dr. K ! Thanks for the reply! Is there a reason why you are not taking folic acid? I found it helps for me.\nDo people at your job know about your thalassemia? \nThanks a lot for your encouragement, same to you! What are you studying? I really love swimming but I am prone to ear infections so I avoid it, which is a pity... Thanks for the reply! I would absolutely open up about it. People are very understanding of actual medical conditions. People in general do not understand or give credibility to Thal minors. You should rather not disclose something that might lead to you getting discriminated out. I am more leaning towards this tbh. Doctors still say thal minors have no symptoms so I doubt people will take me seriously, especially since most if not all references about thalassemia minor say that we have no or very fw symptoms that do not impact daily life. In my case only my immediate family and best friends know and care about me having any issues. Doctors do not take us seriously, so colleagues will definitely not. You might get people accusing you of making excuses to get out of activities. I have been in a corporate environment since last 10 years and it is a pain some days to give even 80%. Specially during periods when I need to manage day long workshops or events. All I can say is stay tough and take care of yourself. &gt; Doctors do not take us seriously, so colleagues will definitely not. You might get people accusing you of making excuses to get out of activities.\n\nYes exactly this is why I have been mostly silent. I mentioned it in passing to my supervisor because my research group was complaining that I do not join them much for lunch... at a super noisy cafeteria and all they talk about is work. \n\nSometimes taking care of myself is conflicting with my phd and vice versa. I am wondering if to take care of myself in the long run I should not seek some part time (or 80%) employment or something (after the phd). Any advice? I am an introvert. Going to a noisy cafeteria is something that my nightmares are built on. Like you, I visit cafeteria sometimes, but only with friends. Coming back to work post or with phd, I do not think it should be hard to manage. Take your vitamins and folic acid, rest on the days that you feel low (like seriously, I use my earned leaves for \"personal work\"), get into some hobbies (I paint and write) and you should be fine. Most importantly, grow your crew at work. Cultivate few friendships that can support you on your off days (be there for them as well). All the best future Dr \ud83d\ude42.  To be honest, I am not sure how much I should be taking. I tried asking my doctor and he does not know much about thalassemia and treats it like anemia. When I was younger, he put me on iron pills and I got super sick. i did have low iron at the time too, but he told me to take 3 iron pills a day which according to another doctor, was wrong considering my thalassemia?\u00bf So now I am scared to try supplements.\n\nI actually have not told anybody at my job about my thalassemia which is something I guess I should. I always thought of it as not being \u201cserious\u201d, but when it affects your daily activities it is something worth telling.\n\nI am in my 3rd year of political science :) do not know what I am going to do after,  but we will see how it all plays out. I can understand where you are coming from; I never had symptoms till earlier this year. Now, I am often so tired that i have no energy to do anything (among other symptoms). Unfortunately, no one takes it seriously when you tell them your thalaseemia is what causing you to feel this way. I remember I told my boss once and he just shrugged it off. I guess because it is not something common that people do not care about it. Try biking. Any exercise that gets your heart rate up consistently helps keep my mind sharp and energy up. That goes for thalassemia, anxiety, depression... Maltofer is apparently an iron supplement,  may I ask why you are taking it? Hey maybe you should go to a haematologist? They might be able to give you a bit more information. If you are living in the west, doctor\u2019s are not really clued in and will tell you lots of conflicting information.", "Why should Thalassemia Minor patients avoid greens and meat? Hi, I am 28 years old diagnosed with thalassemia minor (known since young age). While I do suffer from tiredness sometimes, I never really connected any tiredness to my thalassemia. Overall I am rather full of energy.  I have to note I keep a healthy diet and am active since young age.\n\nI am also a red meat and green veggies eater, and I am reading everywhere that those should be avoided, and I am asking- why? I am feeling way better than other thalassemia diagnosed people, which avoid red meat and green veggies. are there any arguments against it? Because of Iron...Red meat and greens have a lot of iron...In case of thallasemia we do not have a problem with low levels of iron such is a case with other anemia conditions. And if you take too much iron your body cannot dispose it. Iron stays in your body and it have a toxic effects on organs. I think it is more of an issue to those that have regular  transfusions because they have to be careful with their iron levels. The iron can be toxic and effect the liver and kidneys. I am no expert. My son was recently diagnosed with Beta Thalasemia Intermedia and this is what our doctor has told us. what is the ideal foods to eat then? I was never told this and I was diagnosed at a young age I am now 30 and still havnt been told this by anyone Iron overload! Same here...I HAVE been told to not take iron.  But have not been told to avoid greens and meat, Wth! What should we eat then? I am disappointed in the science industry for being so dismissive about thalassemia in general. (And I am in the science field) i am developing iron overload, an irreversible buildup of iron in the liver as a result of eating meat Acttually they tell bot take iron supplements not iron foods because when we take iron supplements it gives higher  amounts of iron not just for you daily need and that is will harm anybody with normal serum iron not only Tminor people \n\nIn case of thalassemia intermedia they have a high intestinal absorption of iron they can have iron overload from this foods You are also susceptible to T2 diabetes, so do not eat too many carbs either.\n\nSo do not eat greens or meat, and be low carb. Just do not eat, basically.\n\nI think white meat and eggs might be ok. Because typical anemia has a low-iron deficiency, while thalassemia stores iron a little too well (opposite levels, yet still anemia is present).\n\nThalassemia IS A RARE blood disease, anemia is quite common.", "Newly Diagnosed. Freaking out Hi everyone,\n\nJust found this sub and I am so glad!\n\nI am 34/F and was only diagnosed this year, after moving to a new city, that I have both the Sickle Cell Trait and Alpha Thalassemia Minor.\n\nI have almost always taken iron pills and have always been told that I had iron deficiency anemia but it was not bad and to just take some kind of otc iron pill. I have been taking Mega Food\u2019s Blood Builder for a while now.\n\nI started seeing a naturopath this year who for the first time ever, did so many deep dive tests on me and then told me about the findings. She referred me to a hematologist who I have only seen once so far and advised me on a few things. We have another appointment soon to complete some tests and really figure this thing out.\n\nI am scared. I have a hoard of health issues from high blood pressure, a thyroid nodular goiter, migraines, and female issues that I am just at my wits end.\n\nI grew up being really active and over the last ten years have been so tired and fatigue. I have gained about 60 pounds over the years and am just inactive. Loved ones do not understand but I physically and mentally cannot get up sometimes and almost always need a daily nap. It is been like this for years.\n\nMy question is does anyone have any tips on what I should be asking my hematologist? I am so overwhelmed but want to make sure that I am present in asking anything that I should be. \n\nAlso if anyone has any lifestyle, diet, or just coping advice- they are SO welcome. \n\nThank you.  The only thing that has ever helped me was diet and exercise for my thalassemia. I switched from using ground beef to ground turkey in all my recipes. Increased my calcium intake as it can absorb iron. I try to reduce the amount of my iron intake as much as possible. I would stop taking your Mega Food\u2019s Blood Builder immediately though as that is going to increase your iron and that is not helpful for thalassemia. Your blood does not absorb iron properly so when you take iron supplements it cannot dispose of it properly either so my recommendation is look into iron chelators and get familiar with them. Turmeric is my recommendation here. \n\nHowever, exercise, exercise, exercise if you can. Especially strength exercises. The better equiped your muscles are at handling oxygen the better you will feel. You will never have the energy levels of a person without an iron deficieny, but exercise, at least for me, has made it much, much more tolerable. Also, the healthier your weight the less oxygen you require which will also help with the fatigue. When I was at my heaviest I was at my most lethargic. When I trim down and work out I feel my best.\n\nAlso, take all of this with a grain of salt, and consult with your specialist as you have some other conditions that you mentioned but did not go into detail about, so some of my suggestions may not be best for you. Best of luck and remember that it can get better! This is such sound advice, thank you so much!\n\nI was going to purchase some turmeric curcumin last week but did not. I will do that today.\n\nThe exercise advice makes so much sense, when talking about oxygen- thank you. You are most welcome! I am 33 and was lucky to have been diagnosed when I was 2, so I have known about this my whole life. It took awhile into my adulthood before I really began to wrangle the symptoms though. I slept a lot prior to having a regular exercise regiment, so I totally understand how you are feeling! Do your best to stay motivated. When I have to workout and I feel tired I have to remind myself that while I am tired now the fatigue will be much worse if I do not just put up and shut up! Best of luck to you! Thal should not come into play too much here. Minor cases are just carriers. Thal also does not lower your iron, it causes anemia through lack of functional hemoglobin. Unless you were referred to a hematologist because labs showed very low hemoglobin, I would not waste the money on a specialist if this is all you are going for. I would see a gp for bloodwork and take it from there. Source: thal major patient Wow. Yeah it messes with my depression and anxiety because I feel so hopeless like nothing can change. \n\nI am excited to start exercising and being consistent. Thanks!", "Pregnant and my Doctors are AT WAR! I will try to make this as short as possible...  \n\n\nI have thalassemia beta minor, I live in Japan right now, and I am currently 21 weeks pregnant. My internal medicine doctor that I have been seeing for years no longer wants me to see my OBGYN because they STRONGLY disagree on how my iron levels and pregnancy should be handled moving forward. My OBGYN is freaking out about my iron levels and wants me to go to the hospital for a blood transfusion and/or Human Recombinant Erythropoietin (I do not even know what that is). Prior to this he wanted me to do 3 or 4 weeks of iron infusions. When I told this to my regular doctor he freaked out about how dangerous that was for me (he does not even want me taking iron supplements)  and demanded I stop those and refuse to go to the hospital. He says there is nothing wrong with my numbers/iron which really puts me in the middle here. One doctor is saying my baby is suffering and this is dangerous for my unborn child and another is saying iron would be dangerous for me and to let him be the one to monitor my levels... I am a mess with no idea what to do.  I added my latest results below. What do you think??  \n\n\n I had an iron infusion done by my OBGYN on May 15th, \n\nThese are the values my general doctor is looking at....  (taken on June 17th) \n\nMy ferritin level is: 169.8 ng/ml (normal values: 5 - 157 ng/ml).\n\nMy iron level is: 134 \u03bcg/dl (normal values: 50 - 170\u00a0\u03bcg/dl).\n\nMy iron binding capacity (UIBC) level is: 172 \u03bcg/dl (normal values: 110 - 425 \u03bcg/dl).\n\nMy OBGYN is only measuring my\u00a0 Hb\u00a0level\u00a0\u00a0which is 7.5.\u00a0(It was 9 at the beginning of my pregnancy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It might also be worth noting that thalassemia really is not a thing here in Japan so my OBGYN has no experience with it and my regular doctor has not had to deal with it in years \\) I am no doctor but just from reading your post it seems like your normal doctor is more credible. Especially if your OBGYN is only looking at your HB and thinking that is something he can fix. That is just my opinion and in this situation I would be more inclined to listen to the doctor not the OBGYN. I would love to know what other people think! Thanks for your feedback :) I am just worried that if I do not listen to the more extreme advice that something might happen. I have been living with my conditions my whole life so for me, I am not worried. But now I have this little life inside of me to worry about. I can completely understand where you are coming from and it is definitely not a nice position to be in, and it does not seem like an easy decision to make. I hope everything works out for you and you can get some clear cut answers! Thanks so much :) Did your doctor get to see the ferritin/iron levels? Otherwise maybe let another OBGYN check on your blood Yes. Both doctors have seen all the test results. I also have beta thal and my daughter is now 8 months. Our Hgb sounds about the same, 90 before and 75 while pregnant. \n\nI had to take 300mg of oral ferrous gluconate daily. No blood transfusions or iron infusions . I think an iron infusion would actually be harmful since iron does not bind to your hemoglobin properly and would float around as excess..\n\nOnly was to get a blood transfusion if hgb dropped below 65 Your ferritin level is actually high compared to those reference numbers which means that you have adequate stored iron levels as far as I can tell. It seems like your GP is more in depth than your OBGYN but maybe see if you can get a hematology consult You need to be referred to a hemotologist See a hematologist. That is what I did while pregnant and did take iron for a short time. I think you are right. Yeah my regular doc freaked out when he heard I was given an iron infusion. I will not be getting any more of those! Yeah. That is exactly what my GP pointed out. But I do think seeing a hematologist is a good idea. My iron levels seem fine, I think. But I definitely think a hematologist is a good idea. The excess can damage your heart and liver That is what I had always been told, but I thought I must be REALLY low and my doctor was not worried about the risk. I know better now. Yeah, I would not take the iron since that is not what is causing your anemia. I had this problem in pregnancy. You really have to advocate for yourself. You could ask about blood transfusion but I was followed by hematologist so that would be a good idea! Good luck! Thanks so much. Yeah I am requesting a referral for sure. My next obgyn appointment is Monday so I will do it then I hope it goes well! It was stressful because the conflicting advice. I also work in postpartum so I think ob gyns are used to just giving iron automatically without thinking about it. I had my CBC done so many times when pregnant and was supposed to get a transfusion if the hgb stayed in the 8 range.I was advised by the hematologist to take the prenatals with iron in them while pregnant and breastfeeding but no additional iron. From what I have read, plant based iron is more safe. Also methylfolate is supposed to help you produce blood cells so I took extra in pregnancy. My baby seems great so far! Do not forget to clarify with your doctor's that iron (ferritin) and blood (hgb) levels are two different things.  I think sometimes they use the terms interchangeably but should not. They also screened the father of my baby to make sure he does not have a thalassemia trait too as it can require prompt treatment in the baby. I honestly pre screened my husband though by making sure his MCV was normal on his blood work. Oh, I also just want to add that 7.5 is pretty low! Let the doctor know if you have symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath. A transfusion might be a good idea because you usually drop two points after delivery.. so then you would be at 5.5... which seems dangerously low. so this is why you are pressed about my post lmao. hormonal?", "Are these results consistent with thalassemia? I have been very sick, in hospital. Doctor ordered a test next month for thalassemia but I wanted everyone is opinion.  * Also important note: these are the results from after I recovered from being sick. I am not a doctor...some of these counts look like my son\u2019s, who has thalassemia. Specifically the low MCV and MCH, and high RDW. His hemoglobin is lower than yours but the rest is very similar\n\nEdit: Do you know your genetic ancestry? I am Greek American..thalassemia I think usually affects Mediterranean and Asian  people..maybe that helps i agree with what this person said.  \n\nThat is an amazingly high hemoglobin, most of us tend to be around 9, not 120! Exactly! My son\u2019s is 9, mine at last check was 12 I have 126 and higher RBC at 6.53. i think i see the difference here, this is referring to g/L  whereas many tests refer to g/DL.\n\nSo 120 in this test is the equivalent of 12 in my hospital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...Therefore, OP is on the low end.    yeah, i am inclined to suspect beta thal for OP...

I have been told it is in my diet as I became more of a adult I could not live off what I was eating before hand \nI think as a woman it got worse as I got older \nI eat alright and I do exercise as well but I was lacking a few vitamins that I needed and was not consuming enough of \nAsk for a blood test to test all of your vitamins and then ask doctor about it? I was like that too. Starting as a teen was always tired. I have beta-thal and my advice is if you feel any symptoms you have not felt before, definitely check with a doctor. Sure, it could be thal, but you could also have some other underlying issues. Better to be safe!

I do not know if my story will help but I hope it will give you hope. I have Alpha Thalassemia as well. 3 of the 4 genes are broken. I have not needed a blood transfusion. I have always been told I look sick since as far as I can remember. I get winded very easily (like climbing one flight of stairs) and cannot exercise like others due to this. I am still learning about this disease so I do not know how much of my story will pertain to you. I have been able to get pregnant through IVF and now have a wonderful 5y.o. boy. \n\nHere is my story.  I actually found out I had this when trying to conceive.  We started trying when I was around 32/33 years old. we could not on our own for about a year so then went to see an infertility specialist. We go to Kaiser so the specialist is in network. We started with insemination which did not work. So we decided to do IVF.  Before we actually started the IVF process, my primary doctor (who was reviewing my bloodwork even though I had not visited her during this time) calls me to get me on iron supplements since I was anemic according to my results. Upon further review she calls me to tell me to stop immediately because I had Alpha Thalassemia. They then tested my husband to make sure he does not have it as well. The reason being is if he had the same condition we run the chance of a worse case senecio where the baby could inherit 4 broken genes which would not likely result in a successful pregnancy and if it did the baby would not survive much longer after birth. Thankfully he did not have it in any form. We continued and did the first round of IVF. We got 4 embryos and implanted 2. We are lucky it took one round and was able to get pregnant. My son was born 5 1/2 weeks early but healthy otherwise. He did have jaundice but that was treated and since have had no issues. \n\nI wish you luck and hope I may have provided you with something. Sorry I only have Beta but I just took a positive pregnancy test only yesterday. Been trying for about six months, and was getting a little discouraged.\n\nI hope this somehow helps!

It definitely does! Thank you! \ud83d\udc95 And congratulations on getting pregnant! Please take care of yourself. We were lucky to have the doctors we had to help us get to the end of the rainbow. I know we were lucky even without the hemoglobin h disease. Best of luck to you and take care of yourself! My aunt has beta thalassemia major and has to get regular transfusions. She has two adult children. I believe she said she felt like she had more energy during her pregnancy. unfortunately I do not have more details, but it is definitely possible. Congratulations!! I have thalassemia A and I will be 27 weeks pregnant on Wednesday. I had no problems getting pregnant, it was a bit of an accident in the sense that my husband and I did not use protection and his pullout game was not strong. We decided that if it is meant to happen, it will happen. \nOverall I have been tired a lot, and get winded very easily. \nI informed my doctors I have thalassemia A, yet they are treating me as though I have Anemia, and have me on high doses of iron. I am not a doctor so I would been assuming maybe I also had anemia... Regardless, I will be asking my doctor to re-evaluate the need for iron supplements because they may be making me sick. \nI went from being a low-risk pregnantxy to a high risk pregnancy when they saw that my hemoglobin levels have decreased even with me taking iron pills. \nThey would like me to meet with a maternal-fetal medicine doctor next week for some reason. \n\nOther than all that, my baby is healthy, and even big for her gestational age.

Though the final priority list will vary by state, my state (NM) is currently in phase 1b and I was able to schedule my vaccine for next week as a person with Beta Thal. I anticipate most states will follow the CDC recommendations on this one, with only minor changes. As an alpha that will, I would feel bad being in 1b. I wonder if this will be the same in the uk Here in NJ, I was put into phase 1C due to being Thal B minor Same and Thal is sadly not in the list of conditions that they are now offering the vaccine for.

Minor, inherited from my father, now I know why I get tired fast from doing any endurance training or when I fast. Yea i totally understand how you feel! Doctor said if i want to take DNA for Thal Beta it is going to cost money so I have not done it yet. I have alpha thal and I was diagnosed at birth because I was so sick when I was born, so I guess the doctors at the hospital did a lot of tests and found out that way. That is why I am always so surprised when I find out people get diagnosed later on in life cause I have always known I have it and it seems weird to not know Shortly after birth, but it is very common where I am from so it is something doctors always keep an eye on. i have always suspected it, my mother reportedly had it, though she died when i was very young...   I finally underwent a battery of tests for an unrelated procedure and they found it.

Diagnosed around age 2. Neither of my parents knew they were carriers. People with minor can go undiagnosed their whole lives because they rarely require treatment My daughter was first diagnosed by her pediatrician via basic (CBC) blood tests. She was also diagnosed via hemoglobin electrophoresis. It must have been passed through your dad. Males generally have milder symptoms. No, I have thal major - a double recessive trait. Both parents must be carriers to have a thal major child. Carriers (thal trait/thal minor) can live their whole lives without diagnosis or symptoms. Wow! Did your mom have any symptoms? (Everyone on the side of the family it came from has symptoms, in our case). Sorry if my comment sounds dumb, I actually know quite a lot about thal and I have never met anyone with no symptoms whatsoever. But, I do realize that there are tons of different thal mutations. No, they are 56 and 63 and aside from being slightly overweight and the wear and tear of working physical jobs your whole life, neither have any prominent health issues. I am a hot mess though. Dad also has 3 other daughters who have literally never been seen by a physician. I have 1 symptomatic niece (out of 2 nieces and 5 nephews). Mom is a 1st gen from Sicily and Dad is Libyan. Diagnosed at birth. Great grandfather, grandfather and father are carriers of the alpha gene. Both grandfathers died of Thal complications. Mother is a carrier of the beta gene. Skipped my older siblings, my youngest brother and I both have Alpha hgb CS since birth and TDT.", "Is it normal for us to have a high resting heart rate? Mine sits at 80-100bpm \n\nWhen I am walking it is slightly more\n\nIt is concerning but my blood pressure is normal. \n\nI am just guessing it is got to do with thalassemia or my anxiety. Mines at 83 right now laying in bed (give or take, Fitbit accuracy). When I work out sometimes ellipticals tell me to slow down because my heart rate is too high like immediately at a moderate pace not even panting lmao\n\nMy blood pressure is fine and no doctor has ever shown concern (I do not bother telling every doctor about it unless they are prescribing something) mines at 61 right now sitting at work and I am not a very fit person. I only have the minor version though No idea if it is normal but I am quite fit tet have a high resting heart rate like yours My average resting heart rate is about 60-64. Based on my Garmin. It has been tracking for the last 3 years or so. When I exercise, this general goes up to about 130-137 on average and sustainable. But,if it hits past 145 or so and sustained for more than 5min or so, I start feeling like I am going burst and my body general crashes due to lack of blood/oxygen and I get a massive migraine for rest of the day. \nFor comparison sake, I have Alpha Thalassemia Hemoglobin Type H. 5ft2 male in late 30s. My guess, you are out of shape. I get a low around 40-45bpm during sleep. My record hight was 191bpm during a run. Yes same idk if it is normal but my resting heart rate is 80-100 depending on the day. I check it pretty often on my watch Beta minor, my Apple Watch says a resting heart rate that drops as far as 42 ranging up to 70 sedentary life style but highs of 188 often peaking 165 randomly through the day when not exercising.\nWould not know how much I would trust that but very few times I have been hospital they have told me my heart rate is a bit too low.\nMy brother beta minor too, has a low heart rate and not very active and I know he is set off the machine at the hospital cause it thought he was dead when he fell asleep.", "Thalassemia (A?) and pregnant. I have known that I have thalassemia since I was in high school. I never experienced symptoms so I assumed I was fine until my hemoglobin levels kept registering so low that they were not registering on the device Red Cross uses to allow people to donate blood.\n\nI decided to have my doctor run a few blood tests, and based on my family history she did a very thorough test. She tells me I have thalassemia, and that my iron levels are normal, but my hemoglobin levels will almost always register low.\n\nNow, almost 10 years later, I am pregnant with my first child. I told the doctors immediately that I have thalassemia, and when they ran blood tests, they tell me I have Anemia and put me on relatively high doses of iron supplements. \n\nI take the supplements, and a couple months later they ran another test, and my hemoglobin levels decreased. They have now moved me to the high risk clinic and want me to meet with a maternal-fetal medicine doctor as well as the high risk doctors. \n\nRecently, when I take one iron supplement I start experiencing vertigo, headaches, vomiting, and an overwhelming sense of just not feeling good. I feel better when I do not take the iron, I have told the doctors about my symptoms and I guess they think they are normal for pregnancy. They took another blood test last week and I have yet to see the results. How do I get my doctors to understand me?\n\nTL/DR: I think my OBGYN is treating me as if I have Anemia rather than thalassemia. I have always had low hemoglobin, but my actual iron levels are fine. What should I do? Do you have a hematologist that you see regularly? They should be able to provide recommendations and determine if you are taking too much iron or not. I would also ask them to do a blood test to determine your Ferritin (iron)  levels. Its a really quick and easy test to indicate your iron level. I do not have a hematologist, but my mom told me to request one at my next appointment. She experienced the same thing I am going through, and needed blood transfusions. That was over 20 years ago and I am wondering if anything has changed. Thanks! They seem to only test my hemoglobin levels, and I would always been curious how my pediatrician 10 years ago was able too see that my iron levels were normal. Hi! I am happy to see your post here because I, too, have thalassemia trait, and will be trying for a baby for the first time at the end of the month. I am not sure what to expect, but I have also done genetic counseling right before this COVID situation happened. They confirmed my thalassemia, and there is really no cure for it. I also am just taking prenatal vitamins and no extra iron supplements. My iron level is fine. I would love to stay in touch with you and see how you are pregnancy is going!!! How far are you along? And did you have any difficulties trying? I hope that is okay to ask. For sure! I am currently 26, almost 27 weeks along. I had absolutely no difficulty getting pregnant, seeing as it was not planned. My mother also has thalassemia, and apparently everything I am experiencing with my pregnancy is a mirror image of what she went through 34 years ago with my older sister. \n\nI was not taking any vitamins before getting pregnant, and my doctor put me on iron supplements around 12 weeks pregnant because of my low hemoglobin levels. I am having a high-risk pregnancy, so I will be meeting with a maternal-fetal medicine doctor on Friday for a consultation. I plan to bring up (again) that I have thalassemia, but this time I will request they specifically test my iron levels as opposed to my hemoglobin. \n\nThis is my first pregnancy, so all I can offer is what I have experienced thus far, but I hope I can be of some assistance. Thanks for sharing. I just started following you, so I can check back in, and I can also share any updates that I find may be beneficial for you too. I am 29, and it is nice to see many successful and healthy stories from other thalassemia individuals. I have a friend who has it, and she has three healthy children. \n\nMy primary doctor was the one that actually made the discovery that it was thalassemia. I was always anemic, and they always assumed my iron levels were low. We finally did lab work for my iron levels (which was her suggestion), and it came out that my iron levels were high, and she had me stop taking them! She forwarded my blood work to another clinic where they confirmed it was thalassemia, and to do genetic counseling when ever I planned to try for a baby. \n\nIt is crazy that I would not have known if it was not for my doc to double check on it. Best wishes to you!!! Oh and I forgot to point out that my genetic counseling was done at a Maternal Fetal Care clinic. I am also assuming I may be seeing them for check ups etc. I have not checked up on that yet, but we will take it one step at a time! Definitely get your ferritin levels checked on your next test. Also, go see another hematologist or doctor for a second opinion. I have been told that taking too much iron supplements when you have thalassemia can actually be bad for you and lead to iron accumulation. I usually avoid it unless my ferritin levels specifically are low. It will not help at all if your ferritin is not low anyway. \n\nDoctors have given me folic acid before, which helps you generate more red blood cells (I have thal minor with low hemoglobin counts always). My hemoglobin counts always correlate with the number of red blood cells I have. The more I have the better my hemoglobin. \n\nFor me, the L-5-methyl folate version of folic acid seems to work better. I just buy it as a supplement (I take 500 mcg every few days). The normal stuff that gets prescribed does not seem to do anything for my blood counts or energy, but this form seems to give me more energy. And recently I had better than usual counts while taking it (not sure yet if it was a fluke or not. I have not been taking the supplement consistently). \n\nThat being said, if your blood counts are very low then the only solution I am aware of is transfusion. Hi, first of all congratulations!! My sister's  haemoglobin had also dropped in her 2nd trimester. Her doctor told her that its very normal for thal minors to experience the drop. You will however need constant monitoring and intermittent admission. Consult a hematologist too in the meantime. Hope it goes well for you. Take care! What is intermittent admission? Intermittent admission in hospital (only if its needed). I am sorry you are experiencing this. I am just about to be 9 weeks pregnant so I am still in my first trimester.\n\nI would see a hematologist just so you could get their opinion, although, the one I saw before I got pregnant was of no help. She did the same thing to me, telling me I needed more iron. I know it can be so frustrating when a healthcare provider will not listen to you. I really sympathize with you there. \n\nSomething that has helped me is beef liver capsules. Everyone is different, of course, but it has a different sort of iron that does not make me sick and is a good source of folate, copper and zinc which you need just as much as iron to prevent severe anemia. I bought the ancestral supplements from amazon.\n\nOn top of that I take the Jarrow formula methyl B12 and methyl Folate which helps me a lot with energy. Folic acid is useless for me because I have the MTHFR gene where I do not convert it at all.\n\nOn top of all of this, whichever healthcare provider you see should be pretty aggressive with your bloodwork. Before I got pregnant, my primary doctor checked vitamin D, which was low, my potassium, which was low, among a ton of other things. Surely your OBGYN can do a lot of that. Addressing these issues has helped me a lot. I think it is just going to be a process so try to set small goals for yourself. \n\nAgain, I sympathize with you on the vertigo. I have battled that for a few years now. It is not fun either! Vestibular exercises can be done at home and may provide relief. I just watch a YouTube tutorial and follow along with it.\n\nSorry this is long! I just hope something I mentioned might help. As always, talk to your doctor before trying anything you read online. :)\n\nBest wishes to you and your baby. Good luck!\n\nI am about to be 9 weeks and it did not take us very long. We are both 29. Congrats! That is wonderful news! Is the baby your first? It is. I am so nervous!", "Thalassemia + poor mental health = ??? Hi everyone! I (f 26) was diagnosed w beta thalassemia minor at around 23, and have had various mental health issues starting when I was a teen. Now that I am older and no longer growing, I have found that physical symptoms of b thalassemia affects me more. On top of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and ADD, I get discouraged really easily when I am too tired to execute simple tasks. I try to be easy on myself, but when I was younger it was so much easier for me to do more; cutting things out of my life helps take the stress of responsibilities off my shoulders, but I want to do m o r e with my life. \n\nI feel like there is little to no support system because doctors cannot really do anything to help b thalassemia, which I have been slowly learning to accept, and most people with similar mental illnesses cannot relate to what it feels like to be exhausted from b thalassemia. Therapy can be helpful for mental health issues, but most therapists do not understand what it is like to have a \u201cbad blood day\u201d as I like to call them. It can be draining (both physically and mentally) to try to do more than one task a day. I am tired of sitting on my couch trying to regain strength to do something, anything, the dishes, call a friend, make a craft, etc. Any advice or words of wisdom or support? It is lonely out here. ah, I forgot to mention, I have some heart issues on top of these things and I will actually scream if another person mentions for me to please consider exercising lol I have alpha thal not beta, but I totally understand with the mental health thing. I often get down because I am always tired and I feel like I cannot do things physically that other people can and it is not something people really understand who do not have this. My hemoglobin is at an 8.5 or so which is really low but not low enough to get a blood transfusion so I am always running on what feels like a low gas tank. I wish I had a better support system too which is why I joined this sub ahh thank you for your input! I am about the same as you, and I always describe it to friends as \u201crunning on fumes\u201d too. That sort of helps them to understand a little I (non-binary 34) alpha Thal diagnosed at birth and TDT. I have a list of health issues bipolar, diabetes, heart failure and then some growth issues. Your symptoms is something very common for us but it does get better, once you accept that the illness does not define you. The exhaustion and pains is inevitable and unfortunately forever but finding things that eases them will help physically and mentally.Yoga and breathing helps with the pain and if I am recognizing I am a bit more exhausted today, I will take it a little slower and accomplish my mini goals until I am ready. Staying positive and optimistic helps get through the bad days; even on the days I literally do not have the energy to get up to even brush my teeth because my hemoglobin is at 6 and I will not be transfused for another week. It takes a lot of strength and self-motivation to pass through all these Thal barriers. Do not worry, you are not alone and there is support.\n\nThalassemia has a nation wide support group and local charters in certain states, it take some researching for your area.  has a great support system and we hold yearly events and conferences. Just reach out and ask for help. The team, patients and families helped get me through my teens and now an independent adult. I wish you all the best. Go beyond the bounds to find what works for you, never give up. Thalassemia is really a systemic disease. Ive read about vitamin e deficiency but really i think the genetic interpretation of it only affecting blood cells is too constrained. One example is hypothyroidism (know you have thalassemia minor but this applies to all thalassemias). \n\n Thank you so much, your words and advise are extremely helpful, I am wishing the best for you as well \ud83d\udda4 You should see a hematologist and determine your HB levels.\n\nMaybe you need blood transfusions. thanks! I saw them in March and they determined that I do not need them, but I appreciate the insight :) This sounds very similar to my Girlfriend's day-to-day experience with Thalassemia. She is had some success in using a drug called modafinil (off-label.)\n\nFair warning; it is much more of a band-aid for the symptoms than a solution to any of the underlying problems, but it does seem to pretty consistently give her the energy and motivation to keep moving forward on difficult days. I know this is old but I just had to say, I am in almost the exact same situation as you. I just learned of my b thalassemia trait via my 23andme report which would explain my physical exhaustion that no one else, even with similar mental health issues, can seem to relate to. I am only 21 but I have already gone through the gradual decline in energy since childhood and through my psychiatric journey (the issues were present since my teen years as well) I have been trying to find a solution to what seems like chronic fatigue and overwhelm. I am so glad to know that some others CAN relate and I have at least once reason to believe I am not just a lazy piece of shit.", "Loss of muscle mass due to thalassemia minor? Hi guys, \n\ni am interested to hear your opinions...I have been diagnosed with beta thalassemia minor, and my whole life I have struggle to make weight and build storng muscles...And what is more interesting every time I get sick from a flue or something similar I dropp few kilograms...So do you think that reason for my condition could be beta minor thallasemia?\n\nThanks, Unfortunately that could be a major contributor to your weight loss, my dad is beta thal minor and he went through the same thing as well the one time he had flu. Lost 6kg in 3 months which was unnatural but doc said it was common in beta thal minors who have a slightly aggressive cold or flu or something of that sort. Hey there,\n\nThanks for a quick response...I also coz I am very tall 205cm have problems with my low back...It is like my muscles  from time to time weaken and cannot support my spine and I get terible pains! I cannot function for like a week...So I am looking for a solution how to maintain my muscles strong all the time? The flu is probably lowering your appetite and dehydrating you, so you are eating less and losing water weight. Probably nothing to do with Thalassemia.\n\nAs for muscles, fewer healthy red blood cells means less oxygen transporting to your muscles, so working out is more exhausting and you do not get to make as much progress. Before exercising, try supplementing with something that increases your blood oxygen levels like L-Citrulline or beetroot. Hopefully that will help! Thanks for answer, will try those supplements! L-Citrulline has been a life saver for me, so I hope it works as well for you too! Will try it! Weight loss is due to being sick not thalassemia. I have built plenty of muscle with beta minor but it can definitely slow your progress. Do a lot of cardio to build endurance. Eat a LOT of food early in the day to have energy for your workout. Having beta thalassemia minor means your body spends a lot of energy making more red blood cells than usual, calories just fly away. On the positive side it is also why we have lower incidence of metabolic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.\n\nJust eat more, and better. Supplements help. Mix your whey with powdered oats. Avoid infections, maintain diet and any supplements or medicines you have been advised to take, honestly speaking there is only so much you can do but trying to stay fit all the time will help considerably in the long run. Hi jawnwallei for answer,\n\nCan you tell me which exercises I can do to make my low back muscels stronger? i have also problem with discus hernia and once in every couple of moths I get very stiff and in terible pains...So I think maybe Thalassemia somehow is affecting muscels to be weak...I am also not very good in endurance trainings and heavy lifting... Cannot relate. I have always had weight issues. I lose weight on the flu but that is because I will not eat during the duration of it. Even eating healthy like I have been has made weight loss slow. \n\nOP is losing weight from the flu, not thal", "Teardrop cell and what it means Hi everyone, recently I got a blood test and apparently it showed teardrop cell in my blood. My doctor was not as concerned as I tho she will, she just asked for another blood lab, if this show again I will see hematologist. I decided to ask for a hematologist faster anyway since this freaked me out so much, but due to Covid, I cannot see a hematology for another month. Just wondering whether teardrop cell is a common occurrence in thalassemia. I was never diagnosed with this, but my gynecologist mentioned once I might have thalassemia, and now I am wondering whether it has got to worst Tear-drop cells are common in Thalassemia. I have tear-drop cells, bite cells, and Heinz bodies. I have Beta Thalassemia, Dominant and require intermittent blood transfusions because of it. I also have Class 1 G6PD Deficiency and it causes hemolytic anemia if triggered. Infections are huge triggers. I get Heinz bodies oxidative stress induced hemolytic anemia when I eat fava beans, take NSAIDS, or if I am exposed to products with Naphthalene including moth balls and certain paints. I usually have to get blood transfusions during these types of hemolytic crises. Does the same issue affect Thalassemia Minor? How did you find all this out about yourself? I have beta thalassemia major and sometimes it feels like my doctors are just grasping at straws. Unfortunately I found out the hard way. My G6PD Deficiency was actually first discovered by my husband. I was in ICU and my kidneys were shutting down, I had fluid around my heart, pneumonia, lesions on my liver, my O2 stats were in the 80s, my hemoglobin was 8, and then I got hospital acquired sepsis. The doctors were clueless and had given up. My husband researched my prescription meds and my symptoms and hemolytic anemia due to G6PD Deficiency kept popping up. My doctors stopped all the contraindicated meds and I started improving. My confirmation test came back negative most likely because I was tested too soon after my crisis and because I am a female. Because G6PD Deficiency is x linked and women have 2 X chromosomes, x inactivation can cause false negatives. I got genetic testing because I knew that was the most accurate confirmation test I could take and plus I wanted to know what variant I have. When I got my results it not only showed that I have G6PD Deficiency Ilesha variant (Class 1) as well as the African variant (Class 3). My class 1 G6PD Deficiency causes Chronic Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia. I also discovered at that time that I have a rare form of Beta Thalassemia called Beta Thalassemia, Dominant. My Beta Thalassemia was caused by insertions on chromosome 11, where the HBB cell is located. Mutations on the HBB cell can cause Beta Thalassemia and/or Sickle Cell Disease. I have really tried to educate myself and my doctors about my genetic disorders because they are clueless. Even my Hematologist  is uneducated about genetic blood disorders and mainly treats oncology patients. Whenever I have a crisis, he tells me \"I am not concerned\" or \"take some ibuprofen\" \ud83e\udd26 I keep telling him that when my hemoglobin is at 8, the protocol is to do a transfusion. I also keep reminding him that ibuprofen is contraindicated for people with G6PD Deficiency. He is arrogant though and keeps telling me, \"I am the guy you see for your G6PD Deficiency/Beta Thalassemia\" \ud83d\ude44. I usually go to the ER whenever I am having a crisis because my Hematologist is so uneducated. The hospital Hematologists usually do a haptoglobin test which indicates whether a person is has hemolytic anemia or not. My advice to you is to get a Health genetic test and to educate yourself as much as possible. Tear-drop cells can be indicative of Thalassemia period. Poikilocytosis is when your blood smear test shows that you have a large amount of tear-drop cells (or other abnormal red blood cells) mixed with regular red blood cells. Depending on how bad your crisis is, your Poikilocytosis may have a +1,+2, +3, or +4 values. +1 means 1/4 of your blood is affected, +2 means half of your blood is affected, +3 means 3/4 of your blood is affected, and +4 means all of your blood is affected with abnormal red blood cells. I have personally never had a +4, but I have had +1 and +3 before. +3 is when I have to get blood transfusions.", "Thal Minor - Covid - vaccination? Hey everyone! I just found this group, I am 29 years, male and have Thal Minor. I am not vaccinated yet. Many People next to me had Covid, luckily i didnt get it yet. \n\nDo you belive in the \"higher\" immunity through the thal against covid?\n\nAre you vaccinated? I am really insecure to get the vaccination.\n\nThank you for your answers! get the pfizer one, it is recommended for thalassemia, i have both shots and had covid a few months ago, did not see any side affects You had covid after vaccination? Do you had any symptoms while covid? i had it before vaccination , light symptoms, i was just feeling tired and wanted to sleep all day, that was all Why it is recommended for Thalassemia compared to other vaccines? i did not ask, that was what my doctor said \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f There is no evidence that thals are covid resistant, and thal minors can get the vaccine with no added risk from our disorder. My hematologist told me to get whichever one was available to me. I have had three Moderna doses and had no problems aside from normal post-vaccine fatigue and some lymph node swelling, which is common for everyone. I had covid before and it was kind of bad. Not like needed to be hospitalized bad and not like my friends who did not feel much. \n\nI got both vaccine doses and both times I felt fever and body aches the next day. Some pain killers and Xbox all day and you will be fine.  Yeah we thal minor have immunity, there is some early research supporting this, my entire family got covid, sister who is also thal minor no symptoms all in same house. Non thal family all ended up in hospital \n\nI got Pfizer vax btw, side effects were very rough and disabling in my case. Took me a couple of weeks to recover Gf is Thal beta major. She is vaxxed. Her hematologist recommended it. I do not see a reason against it besides idiosyncratic political beliefs. My wife has always had that minor and has had both shots and the booster. That does not provide \"higher\" immunity. Not sure where that nonsense comes from. Get your shots if not for yourself then for everyone you come in contact with Do you know where I can find an article about this? Very interested It was somewhere in the south of Italy that they have a large number of people that have the stigma of thalassemia and did not get Covid-19\u2019s. I have read something in the paper but I cannot find it now I am beta thal minor. I have had 3 shots. Got my 3rd shot 2 weeks ago at the same time as a flu shot. Started coughing the day after 3rd shot. It has gotten better in the past couple of days but not completely gone. The coughing may be the result of a cold unrelated to the shot. If you find it, let me know. This news would never be where I live and I could be missing out on information.  I have always wondered since they used an anti malaria drug to help symptoms for normal people.", "Iron supplements So I went to my hemotologist today. I have know that I have thalassemia minor for years. I was always told... having thalassemia that u should not take iron supplements because it does not bond to the blood cells correctly and can cause heart attack or stroke. After looking at my iron levels she said I should b taking an iron supplement and b rechecked in 3 months. I am scared to take them... ive always avoided taking supplemental iron and stuck to red meats and dark greens. Advice?? What do u think?? So I took them for years then started reading I should not have been prescribed them and stopped. I saw others posting here sharing side effects that I recognized as side effects I also felt while on them and I stopped feeling like utter garbage after I stopped.    \nConsidering a lot of people are not well versed in this disorder I am now super paranoid about it. \n\nI think the danger however comes from having too much iron and it not being filtered. My problem was I was being prescribed way too high an amount while also trying to eat iron rich foods. I bought gentle iron... low dose... which ironically cost more... but im too scared to go with anything higher!! You could try a one a day multivitamin with iron! Those typically have low amounts of iron (I also have minor trait)! If you are a female I would try a prenatal vitamin since those have extra folate to help our body make more RBCs\n\nEdit: typo If your ferritin level is low  or less than 100\n then you should take iron supplements. I have been taking it from 3 months. If your ferritin level is low  or less than 100\n then you should take iron supplements. I have been taking it from 3 months. If your ferritin level is low  or less than 100\n then you should take iron supplements. I have been taking it from 3 months. Did your hematologist tell you how much or what kind to take?  When I first saw one she gave me fairly specific instructions about what I should be taking. It took some research to find a product that matched what she suggested but I settled on Garden of Life Vitamin Code raw iron in the 22mg dose. Because it is a low dose and sourced from whole foods my body is able to process it without any noticeable side effects and my blood work still looks good after being on it for a few years. All she said was gentle iron which is a low dose. That sounds generally similar to the advice I was given. I was nervous about taking it too because I would always heard that I should not take iron supplements. You might try voicing your concerns to your doctor and asking if you can be tested sooner than 3 months after starting them. I did tell her I was worried about it... she said I should b ok till October.. but if I had any bad side effects to stop immediately and call her! I also take a prenatal for the extra folate", "Alpha Thalassemia Trait in poor air quality? Hi there, \nI am currently living in Northern California and there are wildfires all around my city, making the air quality so terrible, the AQI around 150 for the past week. I was wondering if that would impact someone with thalassemia more than average?\n\nI was told I have the alpha thalassemia trait growing up - and that meant I had tiny blood cells, might be slightly anemic, and that I potentially might be more effected by the altitude. I have always stayed active, preferring long distant running and swimming and have been slightly anemic growing up too, but I have never really known anything different and seem to manage ok. \n\nI have been more tired and get out of breath very quickly lately. It is been so uncomfortable. Do you think this environment would effect someone with the trait more? Yes, we are already running on a reduced O2 capacity in our blood. Anything that would further reduce our ability with O2 intake would impact us more than someone without our blood condition. To improve your RBC/HGB/HCT numbers, I would focus on iron rich foods combo'd with vitamin C foods. Make sure your B12 is topped off and that you have proper sleep/rest. We take longer to recovery than others. Yes. I live in Antelope Valley near the Lake wildfire and I have been having trouble breathing for the past few days. The air quality has been really bad for all people lately, but it is been horrible for people with sensitivities and medical conditions. I have been avoiding going outside, but I can still smell the smoke. Thank you for your reply! Great idea with the B12. I just discovered this reddit and was thinking of taking folic acid as well. I feel you! It is horrible air for everyone and not having any breaks from it is so stressful on the body. Wishing you luck through all this. I wish you luck as well.", "Is hemoglobin (level) the bottom line in determining how one should feel? That is, having little energy...\n\nMy hemoglobin is in the normal range, yet my rbc indices are still wonky. Do mcv, mchc and/or mch factor in at all in terms of tiredness?\n\nAlso, does the hemoglobin level consist entirely of *functional* hemoglobin?\n\nThanks for helping me to understand!\n\n( ETA:  My iron studies are normal Are you Transfusion Dependent aka Thal Major?? No, beta thalassemia minor\n\nETA: Happy Cake Day! Do u take vitamin b complex? Thank you! I forget I started this account on Hallowe\u2019en lol.\n\nHmm wish I had relevant info for you. My experience with how I feel comes as a beta maj. If my iron was high, I would feel like total shit. \n\nOther things to consider ruling out (probably obvious but you would not believe the benefits if consistent): proper sleep, regular exercise, and diet. How are those for you? No, my b12 level was normal (mid-range). I took b12 supplements a couple of years ago but stopped because my level became too high. I could improve in those areas. Fair enough, I am not a star athlete or anything either. Because I am usually very lethargic, I never put **that much** effort into stuff like exercise. I got into biking earlier this year and I could not believe what a huge difference biking every day did for my energy levels. Perhaps you are not, big on biking and that is totally fine. But finding something that you are interested in could help.\n\nI would argue that sleep is #1 on the whole. If you can achieve regular and high quality sleep, you may find that to have incredible and tangible benefits. If you level of b12 became too high that can down your level of b9 (folates ) which is essential for red blood cells production. My red blood cell count is high. Beta thalasemia minor means you will be lazy, that is why Mediterranean people are lazy AF and have the famous Siesta", "Thal minor while pregnant Hello everyone,\n\nBefore I get started just want to put a disclaimer out that I have met with a hematologist a few weeks ago and he will be reviewing my bloodwork with me on Wednesday. However, I got the same kind of initial bloodwork done for pregnancy and my OB called me sounding concerned. \n\nShe told me that I am anemic and she would like me to take iron. I told her that I met with the hematologist and he said that due to the thal minor, it could be harmful for me to take. He said he will review and talk to me about it. She told me to call their office asap with my numbers. I left a message so I am waiting to hear back but these are typical for me. She did not mention Ferritin levels. \n\nHemoglobin 9.6\nHematocrit 32.3\nMCV 65\n\nI am wondering if anyone here who is had a baby - how did you manage your levels during pregnancy? Should I expect them to stay the same? I do not mind taking iron if it will be helpful but obviously do not want to cause any damage. I know I will hear back from the doctor soon but I am paranoid and just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. \n\nThanks all.", "What is your hemoglobin level? Any technique/supplement you use to help raise your hemoglobin level? My latest blood test showed 10.3g/dL..and I am usually in the 10s every time I have been tested. I do not know of any tricks myself to raise my hemoglobin. I do regularly take many vitamins. Quick side story: I recently was at a dr\u2019s visit and when the dr saw my low hemoglobin, they said maybe I should take iron supplements. I mentioned I have thalassemia minor and this is typically not an iron deficient anemia. I further mentioned that I have been told often by other drs that iron may help with anemia, but there is contradicting recommendations from a variety of doctors that say iron is not needed for this anemia. This may be an anemia only hematologists and specialists are truly knowledgeable in. Yep. My Dr tries to get me to take Iron every time I go there. Then he does an iron study blood test and sees I am not iron deficient, again. I am glad I have never actually done what he said as you are correct in that we are not short or iron and those that are have a separate type of anemia. I think its also possible to have both types. Anyway my hemoglobin is 9 and that is pretty normal for me. I am always tired or easily tired and have constant cold hands/feet. i am usually around 9.  I have heard that red meat can help, but of course that is high in iron which will have long-term issues for us. I am at 12.1, I take 1mg folic acid supplements daily, on an empty stomach, at the advice of my doctor. I take folic acid too and it is not helped me. What does do you take? I have been at 6 super low \nI have Thalessmia beta but I am also a vegetarian due to my upbringing \nI get told by the doctors to start eating red meat every visit but I just cannot bring myself to eating it hhaha I do not have any reason against red meat but I just generally dislike it Hm, not sure what you are asking, but if you mean to ask what else I take, I also take vitamin B supplements with my folic acid.\n\nI also eat a pretty varied diet with a lot of different vegetables, fruits, and meats, and grains-- I cannot say conclusively if that has contributed to bringing up my hemoglobin level, but definitely has not hurt! Sorry typo I was asking how much folic acid you take. For a man it is very low how much your red blood cells and MCV and hematocrit Honestly though I do not know how to interpret these things, but:\nRed Cell 5.8\nMCV 60\nHematocrit 35\n\nOn the plus side, in my last test i made it to 10.9 with my hemoglobin waitaminute...\n\nhow did you know i am a man?   \n\nstalker.   :) It is easy to interpret that as I am working in healthcare \n\nRed blood cells = mean the number of red blood cells in for example a 1 mg of blood I do not know how the automat calculates that but there is normal ranges for red blood cells ( 4,5 _ 5,8 ) for man \n\nMCV : mean cells volume it is like the volume of a red blood cell that mean how bigger it is or how small it is or it is normal the ranges are (82 - 97) that have a unit which call FL like meter or mile or feet .\n\nHematocrit: is the\u00a0volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood because the blood does not not contain just red blood cells there is many things plasma liquid and white blood cells and platelets. \n\nHemoglobin is a protein inside the red blood cells which give them the red color as we got thalassemia we have a deficit in synthesis of that protein which give us smaller red blood cells so small MCV and low hemoglobin and low hematocrit .\n\nI hope that will make you have an idea and I hope I was clear in explaining that . English is not my main language. Its it shown in your avatar style and name :) \n\nI think stalking is just for girls :) 1mg once daily. :) If you take transfusions then you are better off without red meat as the excess iron is harmful but if you are only on medication then you should start looking.

I used to, but that stopped when I ran out of healthcare and cannot afford to see a doctor. My work place decided to not give me health insurance. I have not seen a doctor in like 6 years. My 1st day sick, my fever skyrocketed to 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit. I live in the United States so a funeral service is cheaper than a overnight hospital bill. I have a $30k bill from the emergency room already and all they did was look at me, nod and prescribed me a antibiotic. \n\nIt is been a whole week. I am still dead tired, cannot eat, wake up every time with a pounding headache and covered in sweat. What do I do? Is the vaccine not available in your area?  I remember some news regarding the vaccine (Fact check it) said it was affective even on people with the virus but I do not know if that has changed. The vaccine is free so long as you are a US citizen now, do not even need anything besides your ID even fi you are out of state currently (I have a CO license living in FL currently and got mine) They will not let me take it while I am running a high fever. I am beta minor and had a very bad experience with covid, doctors literally saved my life!!! I was having 7 days in a row extremely high fever and no drug helped me at all, so I was taken into hospital and they gave me a high doses of corticosteroids and other drugs that helped me, also an oxygen...I do not want to sound bad but if you have high fever for few days and  nothing seems to help you than it is time to go and seek medical attention ASAP. That seems normal for a week in. I had it back in December &amp; I was in rough shape for 2 weeks. There is really nothing to do because it is a virus. Ideally you would go to a Dr &amp; get an albuterol inhaler &amp; mucinex DM (also available otc), antibiotics are a precautionary measure in case of pneumonia. I am sorry you are sick. Hang in there, drink lots of water, &amp; get a lot of rest. It will take you a little while to build back up to walking normal distances without getting out of breath. Just pace yourself. Dang maybe that was changed then or it is only if you are actively hospitalized. If you are able to be home and the hospital did not deem that you needed to be monitored just try to tough it out and get your vaccine asap when you recover dude. Most research I have seen for people with Thal and covid is that it should not boost it too much like other conditions. This reassures me a little bit. I hope it is roughly two weeks then. I donno if I can hold out not eating much for much longer. I have been doing like 1/4 cup probiotic yogurt daily. I do not have any of the breathing issues that require and inhaler or medication yet. When I called the ER, they recommend I double my dose of ibuprofen. I am happy you made it through! The ER told me to take up to 1800mg (double a normal dose?) of ibuprofen and charged me lol... Did they take your blood samples? You need to monitor D-dimmer and CRP levels and also take a Aspirin protect or something similar every day for blood! Nope. Saw that I can still sit up walk around with minimum difficulty and then prescribed me an antibiotic. Half the nurses I told were like \"what is thalassemia?\"", "Every man for themselves ", "Confused and scared. Do I have low iron, anemia, or thalassemia? TLDR; anxiously waiting for doctor follow-up. reading too much online, got my lab results online: high red blood cell count, low MCH/MCV, high RDW. Vietnamese mid 20s female, bad health insurance\n\nFamily history: Dad has multiple myeloma, mom has low blood pressure, not sure if either has thalassemia. I am a generally healthy female in my mid 20s. I say generally because up until this point I never had any health issues. For months now, I am tired of feeling tired. I always have fatigue throughout the day, I can barely work out, but short walks are OK. Which is crazy, I used to be on the tennis team, run track, like I am so boggled because I was such a healthy person, now I can barely run a mile without getting lightheaded and dizzy. Now that we have to wear masks all the time (I am not against this) I noticed my lack of oxygen causes me to be even more lightheaded than usual, things get fuzzy, I start getting confused, my words do not even make sense sometimes, I notice this when reading back texts to friends and my boyfriend. At work, my employer has allowed me to take frequent breaks to go outside and take off my mask. I am bringing this up because my other co-workers can wear up to 4-6 hours and will be fine, but every 2-3 hours I have to go outside and breathe because I start getting woozy. It is like, everything just hit me this year and my health took a toll. Last year I passed out after having one cocktail, this happened a total of 3 times from 2019-2020. It was very scary. Things go black, I can feel the blood leaving my face, I get cold and pale. AFter I drink lots of water I am ok again. Its odd because during college I was a heavy drinker and never had any issues. I have never even blacked out from drinking and have a strong digestive system. I have read that consuming alcohol if you have thalassemia can aggravate the oxidation levels /  iron something like that.\n\nI know I am low on iron anyway because my diet is not the best, I eat a lot of chicken, pork, rice. But am trying to eat more red meat, greens, citrus fruits, things like that. Yet if I consume more iron rich foods or vitamins, that could be bad for me if I have thalassemia? And sometimes anemia and low iron deficiency can be misdiagnosed? My doctor was not sure what I had so he had me redo my blood panel test.\n\nI dont know if my doc will refer me to a specialist I really want him to. He suspected I had thalassemia, and my insurance is for low income people with the state, so I dont really have a great source of care, its extremely difficult to get an appointment because all the people in need in my area.  I am really worried and scared for my future because I plan on having kids in a few years and I read you could have heart complications, liver problems.. just freaking myself out. It depends on the severity of the thalassemia, but if you have been able to get through just fine until now, it is most likely of the \"minor\" variant rather than the \"major\". Reason being is you would most likely be needing transfusions and iron chelation therapy if you inherited the \"major\" variant. That is kind of the \"good\" news. On the flip side, there is not a lot that can be done with the symptoms of the \"minor\" variant other than eating a healthier diet and improving your lifestyle. \n\nThalassemia is not a iron deficiency disease, but rather a hemoglobin disease. You can have all the iron stores in your blood, but if the hemoglobin protein that contains the iron, a portion of it is corrupted/mutated and does not hold oxygen, no amount of excess iron can fix that. Legitimate iron deficiencies however, can certainly exacerbate the symptoms of thalassemia patients. \n\nOne of the ways to improve your iron absorption is combing vitamin C rich foods when eating foods rich in iron. Personally, I am biased towards more plant based sources because they do not induce oxidative stress with heme-iron (found in meat) vs non-heme iron (in plants). However, if you are really low in iron, heme-iron is absorbed quicker as a quick fix. \n\nThe other solution is forcing the body to be more efficient with less. You mentioned you ran track, have you stopped this year from cardio based workouts? I would highly recommend taking the MAF route (Maximum Aerobic Function) runs where you run under a specific heart rate/exertion. Zone 2 that is. This forces the body overtime to produce more mitochondria in your muscles. It is a very slow build and can be aggravating at the start, but it works for me. \n\nI hope this was somewhat helpful!

I finally looked into it and it explains a lot. I am fatigued always and pale among other things.\n\nThe reason I started looking into it is because I weightlifting and although I am in decent shape, people who workout for 6 months make more progress than me. I always plateau at the same weight lifted/body size. My forms good, diet, and workout program. I am wondering if minor thalassemia could have any effect on this. My other guess is possibly my testosterone is low so I am going to get that checked out but I thought I would post here and see if anyone knows about this.\n\nThanks. I also have thalassemia minor and started weightlifting over a year ago.  Before that I tried many different types of exercise, but I always had trouble with breathing. I have found what works for me is to lift heavy, lower reps, and not too many different lifts per session. So I might only do 3 heavy lifts, then just some core work and pull ups.  I found that when I tried doing 5+ lifts a session, I would get tired and I could never fully recover. \n\nAnything that resembles HIIT, does not work for me. It exhaust me and takes forever to recover. So I take lots of rest between sets, and lift slow and steady. I focus on form and on progressively overloading.

", "Multiple Diagnosis Hi there,\n\nI have thallasemia intermedia and my B12 levels are considered low, not chronically low but on the low end. For that reason my doctor tested me for pernicious anemia; although some of those tests came back negative and the tentative result is no, one did come up positive for increased parietal cells. Now I will be seen by  gastroenterology to see if I could have atrophic gastritis. Mind you I have no symptoms of pernicious anemia or gastritis. The doctors are doing their due diligence, I suppose. My question to you guys is, are there any of you who have diagnosis such as pernicious anemia or auto immune gastritis/atrophic gastritis? I am actively trying to catch up on years of schooling and understanding.. thankfully in my case I might have some sort of Asperger\u2019s combined with a ridiculously high and overly active brain that has blessed me with the single best skill I possess which is being able to analyze and process large amounts of complex and foreign information and draw several conclusions quickly to create benchmark roots to begin thorough research.. my Father has passed the trait to myself and my siblings and recently has been dealing with some strange neurological events that have absolutely no deep etiology and pathology to describe it it is almost like a marvel of the beauty and power our brain\u2019s possess and it is many d\u00e9fense mechanisms..\n\nAll I can say is I am going down a road now where I am doing full and thorough endocrinal testing because his decades of kidney/renal complications, gut and gastro problems (susceptibility to ulcers not only in the esophagus but everywhere including myself and my siblings) that has been misdiagnosed as GERD (heartburn is just our body\u2019s reaction to something it should have never been treated as something that should be treated and stopped and blocked from functioning it is a defence mechanism not a burden in the majority of acute cases), his strange stature and incapacity to lose an abdomens gut despite us having very healthy and clean diets in caloric deficit and his daily physical activity for someone his age. \n\nI am convinced it is adrenal gland disorders. His case with skin cancer and melanoma in recent years solidifies this thinking further for me. I will only know beginning next week when I start deep diving into it. \n\nAll I can say is that all the individuals in my family and extended family or friends with this known trait have all had some combination of misfiring stress hormone related symptoms to a faulty fight or flight mechanism and poor stress handling and unnecessary stress bearing on very very normal things so high irritability + renal and kidney issues in regards to sodium mainly and fluid to blood to sodium to potassium ratios, including kidney stones over the years, cholesterol coming and going over the years, acute hypertension that is not chronic and comes in waves, and pituitary concerns including MRI evidence of lesions and what they have called benign growths or cysts in the hypothalamus area.. which is used to help manage relationship with kidney and sodium and water and aldosterone and vasopressin secretion. \n\nLight sensitivity to sun or whole driving which shows evidence of adrenal fatigue (not a medically recognized condition but there is some merit at least to understanding what it means by having too little or overly stimulated glands and hormones that cause these symptoms)\n\nMulti decade long problems episodic and acute moments of very itchy skin after a shower for instance where no matter what soap gets used or thrown out and new ones tried it still happens no explanation from dermatologists \n\nOlfactory problems with smells that get to you like from cleaning products, air fresheners, any incense burning, certain colognes or perfumes, etc. \n\nChronic episodes of moments of dizzy spells loss of balance confusion and particularly fears of doom which is related to the misfiring glands and fight or flight risk mechanism during those acute moments of hypertension \n\nThe problem with him is that it is the thalassemia trait as a parameter that keeps popping into my head and making its way as it has something to do with it all in a way maybe even saving his life on many occasions My research on Thalassemia is very basic as of now but I am going to dive deeper and have plans to consult with genetic banks and researchers I personally know and get access to some data.. but for now every carrier of the trait female has had early onset puberty in terms of hair growth and suffered their whole lives with hair growth which is indicative of poor adrenal gland functions and the androgynous hormones they have no other symptoms or similarities with other females who share those androgynous levels except for thalassemia which at this point to me shows the relationship to poor adrenal gland function as a predictor variable.. \n\nYour anemia suggestion is in regards to b12 deficiency. But how is your potassium? High Potassium supplementation or production is shown to overshadow the b12 presence leading to low b12. Potassium has a direct relationship with sodium, the pituitary up gland and subsequently the adrenal gland. \n\nHow is your sodium? Do you have chronic dehydration which forces you to drink a lot of water? Maybe you drink less water because of a fear of going to the bathroom when you are not going to be around one etc. Adrenal gland and pituitary misfires can produce both low and high sodium both low and high potassium since they are inversely related in a way. \n\nI am going to have to dig deeper into figuring out if thalassemia trait produces false positives in the electrolyte panel lab work. If there is a relationship that shows maybe it is able to change the cells or I do not know what which might explain why sodium and potassium might look normalish or maybe not low or too high enough to be of concern. \n\nH2 blockers used to treat heartburn also play a role in b12 deficiencies. \n\nLike it is all connected in some weird twisted way and for the most part what I have been able to deduce is that most thalassemia carriers have less cardiovascular problems in general when they present with these other issues (adrenal hormones, renal and urological function)", "Thalessemia intermedia patients?

I am a 44 year old female. I did not get the JJ one so I cannot speak on it specifically., and it was not available due to being pulled for the blood clot issue when I got mine. I got the moderna and had very few side effects. Some light nausea and I fell asleep soon after each but that is about it.   \n\n\nSome of the problem regarding the info about the JJ vaccine's blood clot issue is that it did not really specify if it was affecting women with predisposed conditions such as women who just gave birth or women currently mensturating.  I would go with your hematoligist's preference to be on the safe side. They are all going to protect you either way. Thal patients in general tend to be more on the hemophilia side of the spectrum, i do not see anything clinically significant with getting the JJ but if in doubt just seek a source for pfizer, that seems to be kind of' the gold standard So, being less likely to clot.... hemophilia?\n\nWith the JJ vaccine, there have been issues with clotting. But being beta thalassemia minor, I would have less likelihood of clotting overall? \nI guess I do not know enough to know anything about BTM. I have it, but I have no symptoms and have never had to seek treatment for symptoms. So I really know nothing about it. \nMy concern with the JJ is the fact of possible blood clots. I was concerned I would be at  INCREAS risk of clots due to the BTM. But it sounds like It may be the opposite? Does that sound correct?\nWhen I called my hematologist office (which I only went to to get medical clearance for a cosmetic surgery I had in Feb), they said to get the mRNA. \nBut I gathered from the call that they did not like the JJ regardless of my Thalassemia. Seems to be a common theme. A lot of negative talk regarding that vaccine in general.\nThe other thing was, that my plastic surgeon said I was \"oozie\" and she had to use medicine to help stop the bleeding. So in my mind, I would NOT be at an increased risk of clotting per say. \nAll to say,.I really do not want the vaccine, but I need to get it. I want the JJ. But am scared and looking for some clinical advice I guess. You should be fine. The blood clots were extremely rare; they are not even sure there is a correlation. &gt; But I gathered from the call that they did not like the JJ regardless of my Thalassemia\n\nThat is generally been the case.

If you have not already, switch to a multi-vitamin for 50+ and watch your iron intake. Sorry, not sure if there is an easy answer to detoxing besides drinking lots of fluids to flush the system. I use a food count book to help limit high amounts of iron intake. I, also drink green tea with meals and add more calcium to my diet to limit the absorption of iron. When possible, work with a nutritionist that knows Thal or a professional that understand Thal. Harvard have good literature on iron, it helps to understand the types of iron and the food groups to make better diet choices that fits your needs. GL! Stay away from foods that are fortified with iron or rich in iron. Staying away from iron supplements and medications that have iron in them. I stay away from multivitamins because they usually have iron in them. My ferritin serum levels are usually normal or slightly below normal so I have never had to deal with iron overload. There are also synthetic and natural iron chelators that lower iron. Turmeric, Quercitin, and Curcumin are a few natural iron chelators. Here is an article that discusses both synthetic and natural iron chelators. \n\n This is awesome! Just what I was looking for. Thank you I used to drink copious amounts of tea after meals (while on Desferal injections) till about I was 21-22. Was told it helps flush out iron, on the side. \n\nOn Asunra from 22-23 till 28 now, and honestly, the only solid way is controlling your iron intake. My family monitored diet strictly till I was 18 or so and after that, I was on top of it. You got to curb the craving for dry fruits (most in my case) and for other food items (egg yolk, leafy green veggies and so on) you got to have a limited quantity and be regular with iron chelation therapy (whatever you are on).", "Any thal majors in this sub?

Honestly, it was be very stressful at first, getting everything set up (going in to meet the docs for the first time, getting chelators for the first time, getting transfused for the first time, etc etc). It was especially tough in Italy because I barely spoke Italian at first and the docs/nurses English was not great either. But once everything got going, it was fine. I am also lucky enough to have an EU passport, so everything was free for me (an improvement from the US!). I suppose it depends what country you are from and where you are trying to go. I looked for either countries that were familiar with thal and/or big international cities with hospitals that had thal programs. Really depends which country's passport you hold currently and where you are off to. I can tell you as an Indian with Thalassemia, you will be paying for transfusions and iron chelation from your pocket. NHS might cover in the UK but you will have to pay up front to get the student insurance and with an existing condition, I am not sure if it is affordable upfront sum. \nFor the US, it is again, paying from your pocket. No scholarship or funding covers the treatment. If you are planning Canada for education, and then to acquire a PR, bear in mind that their point system does not encourage those with genetic and pre-existing conditions, especially Thalassemia.\n\nAs an Indian, your best options are the Middle East and Singapore, mostly cause you can do a balance of coming to India for some transfusions and getting some there.

Hi, thanks for this... Can i DM you regarding this? Sure?", "Supplements for beta thalassemia minor I was tested when I was young and diagnosed with beta thalassemia minor. Generally I am fairly prone to fatigue and had a weak constitution as a child, but it is difficult to judge if this is because of thalassemia since it is a hereditary disease. I was wondering if there are any recommended supplements or beneficial foods that I can include in my diet to counteract the effects of thal minor. I am completely clueless when it comes to supplementation with thalassemia, but I am not sure why I never thought about it, I am hoping to be less fatigued. Hi. I was diagnosed 8 year ago ( I am 38yo). Hema suspected thalassemia because of my low hemoglobin  high rbc and high platelet count and dvt. Mine was unmanaged for my entire life. I thought I just get tired easily because of my weight and the chronic anemia was often dismissed. \n\nI was prescribed with folic acid supplements 5mg daily (the high dose capsules for pregnant women) and B12 tablets, at least 1000mcg daily too. Hope it helps. You can ask your hematologist too for proper dosing for you. Cannot argue with the medical advice, I am looking into the two of them now. The doses seem a little high compared to NHS guidelines but you have been prescribed it so there must be a deficiency, compared to general supplementation. Has your haematologist ever suggested eating certain foods? Or is supplementation the way? I do not have a hematologist atm so I think I will stick with recommended doses for now. Has your hematologist had a significant impact with your treatment?  Have you noticed a difference in your fatigue since taking supplements? I feel like I have been tired my whole life, and just assume it is normal but I do not think it is anymore. Platelet count  or rbc count? Thalassemia has no effect on platelet count. Yep not related to thalassemia but it affects my clotting too. I have recurring DVT and leg ulcers.My platelet count is always at 400,000-500,000. They put me on Clopidogrel and increased my Xarelto after my TIA. I was cautioned to eat less leafy green veggies, which sucks because I love broccoli. I am also on a maintenance of Xarelto for my hypercoagulability. I suffer from DVT and get leg ulcers almost once a year. Yeah, there was improvement certainly.

A couple of months ago, I went to the doctor for blood tests, they came back showing possible mild iron-deficiency anaemia, however at the same time - I also learned my paternal grandmother, great grandfather, a couple of aunts and cousins also had thalassemia. The doctors seem surprised as I cannot say for certain that My family is genetically linked to the Mediterranean or other regions this is common in (lack of family history) and think it is unlikely I have it  because They are focused on it being only found in those ethnic groups. \nHowever they did another test, which was inconclusive for thalassemia and possibly iron deficiency.\nI am on iron supplements, been on it for 2 months now, if anything I do not feel like they are helping, I do not feel more energised, I am still tired a lot of the time, cold etc, after 3 months I will go for retesting to see if it is resolved the issue. Is this normal procedure? \n\nTLDR: family history of thalassemia (in-improved by iron supplements), test results are inconclusive for thalassemia and show possible iron deficiency anaemia. Taking iron supplements for a couple of months. Should I feel better on the supplements by now?  If supplements are not working you might need transfusions and chelation...are the docs checking your iron levels and how they change with supplements? What tests did they run? While thalassemia is mostly common in the Mediterranean it does not mean it does not exist in other populations as well...could also be thalassemia trait, or thal intermedia, a more mild version of thal.\n\nCheck out the ( for more info  I will take a look thanks. I am due to get another check of my iron levels but only after 3 or 4 months of taking the iron supplements, not 100% sure which tests they ran though, will try to find out though  So, you do not have actual Thalassemia *disease* if your tests are \"inconclusive.\"  You would know if you had two bad alleles.  \n\nIf you have Thalassemia at all you would likely only have one bad allele, which would be called Thalassemia Minor and would mean you are capable of making good red blood cells with your good allele, just slower or less quickly replaced when you lose blood.   \n\nTaking iron supplements is risky if your body is not able to use it all to make red blood cells because it will get stored in your other organs which can cause iron toxicity.\n\nYou should push your doctor for a conclusive answer to whether or not you carry the Thalassemia allele because that will affect your approach to getting your iron up. \n\nAlso:  if it turns out that taking supplements is right for you: take them on an empty stomach if you can tolerate it.  Eating anything else with it will reduce your absorption.  Even if you cannot tolerate taking it on an empty stomach then totally avoid consuming caffeine within two hours of your supplement.  Caffeine will block iron absorption. \n\nIf you are a vegetarian you should reconsider that.  For most people vegetarianism is totally fine, but for people with chronically low iron you need the most absorbable iron available and that is in red meat.  Yes, there is plenty of iron in green leafy vegetables, but it is not very bioavailable; it will pass right through you.  \n\n", "Friend late on transfusion, sick, what to do?

The medication costs 10 grand but you can receive it for free as long as your household makes under 120k a year.\n\nHas anyone tried it and got results??? I really hope this will work for me. Beta Thal Major here. I have a pending order for it with my doctor since 2019. My order was going through all the government reviews and approvals to get it purchased/imported through the Ministry of Health (I was the first person in my country to require it). Then came covid which threw a wrench in the wheels of bureaucracy and the government's administrative/monetary focus. It is still on order, i will post an  update when I receive it. What is it for? Iron chelation? I am Beta Thalassemia Major. I have not yet but I am in the process. My doctor has several patients that have been on it for a year and it is been working as expected (reducing transfusion frequency by about 30%). What is it do specifically? This is to help your red bloods cells mature properly and can help reduce iron concentrations, partly because of needing less transfusions. It is a chimera gene protein made in a lab, designed to inhibit signals from SMADs. They are overactive genetic proteins that need to be suppressed so that red blood cells can mature effectively. I have. I did about 4 doses of it last year, and it was fairly effective for me- my hemoglobin stayed higher than normal (11/12 instead of 9/10 pre-transfusion). I got a lot of bone pain in my jaw, back/hips, and a ton of fatigue about a week before my transfusions. I would also get super intense headaches, but this was around the start of the quarantine, so I do not know whether it was anxiety or tension, possibly undiagnosed Cov, or a side effect of the medication. The side effects were really debilitating me for 1-3 days at a time per transfusion cycle, so I stopped taking it. Strangely, just around the time I stopped, my ferritin shot up for no reason (I was receiving the same (or less) amount of blood, same chelation) and stayed about 1000 higher for a good 6-8 months, then started coming back down. A nice side effect, however, was that my bone density increased. Did you feel less tired and less out of breath at some point during Reblozyl treatment? I do not generally feel out of breath, so no difference for me there. I was not feeling tired a day or two before my transfusion like I typically do, but under the reblozyl, I would get the intense fatigue (combined with the bone pain) a week before my transfusion, and that would basically force me to lay on the couch for a day or two, unable to do anything. So in terms of tiredness/fatigue overall, for me it got worse on the medication, even though my hemoglobin looked better on paper. Based on bloodwork, I may have moderate thalassemia beta. However I have never gotten transfusions. But I get tired as all the time, depressed and fatigued during sports (which causes insecurity). I just thought if hemoglobin went up, it should decrease fatigue? On paper, I have low levels. Ohh ok that makes sense. My haematologist did mention this maybe two or three years ago saying how it is going to be coming soon or something. I hope lots of people are able to get this and it gives our poor veins a little break. \ud83e\udd7a It should in theory. For me, I have been transfused my whole life, so I feel like my body has adapted to being consistently around the 9-12 hemoglobin range. Compared to a non-thal person, I definitely have lower endurance and get tired more easily (hiking, biking, etc). But I  try to accept it if my body is telling me to rest, and push a little bit at a time. I think exercising regularly improves my body's ability to deal with it, but ultimately I have just accepted that I cannot compare myself with a person who has a hg of 14/15/16-  they are just getting way more oxygen into their muscles than I am. So I guess it depends what your goals are with sports. You can definitely do them, but you might have to adapt your training, and try not to compare yourself to athletes with normal to high hemoglobin levels. &gt;Reblozyl\n\nDo you think it will help with the jaundice associated w/ it. Its def a struggle because most people have clear white eyes, and can just sometimes be annoying having to look everyone in the eyes knowing they see the yellow... just asking what ur thinking Funny you bring this up because sometimes it feels like I am the only one who suffers from severe jaundice, especially in my eye whites.  \n\nI do not know if Reblozyl helps but I sure as fuck hope so. My highly unscientific opinion is that, to a certain degree, it should reduce jaundice. If you think about it, and someone correct me if I got this wrong, jaundice is due to elevated bilirubin levels, which are caused by the breakdown of RBCs, which for thal patients is greater than \"normal\". So if Reblozyl reduces RBC breakdown, that reduces the overload of bilirubin which the liver needs processes and excretes, and thus reducing jaundice.", "Beta Thal &amp; Vaccine?

Because I take about 6g a day, this means 8 pills (at 750mg each), or about 9g of the powder because it is usually 2:1 with malate (so 3g of citrulline malate is just 2g of citrulline). \n\nSo depending on how I feel, I will switch between taking a bunch of pills throughout the day or making a jug of fruit water with the powder in the morning to sip on slowly.

Think I am going to speak to a different doctor on Monday, because the giving out of inaccurate information is worrying to me Yes definitely get a second opinion. I am not sure how the UK system works but I am a physician in the US and I would probably treat this with iron with follow up to check your iron levels Thanks that has been really helpful. Would it still be safe to go on iron with my red blood cell count at that level? Someone on another site for BT said that my rbc seemed to be getting too high? Also with my ferritin being at a good level despite some lower iron and transferrin saturation index levels? Thanks for the help It is definitely not classic, but I would try the Iron. What is your Hbg? If you mean haemoglobin then my concentration is 123 g/l with a reference range of 115-160 so this is actually quite good for me Interesting. This whole time I thought you were anemic. \nDefinitely should try to see a specialist Oh so would you have expected my haemoglobin to be slightly lower with the fact that my iron serum and transferrin saturation index are slightly lower out of the normal range then? So I do not have any iron deficiency anemia then? It is all quite confusing to understand, especially when you do not want your doctor to fob you off because they do not know enough or care enough You did not notice the mean thing which is hemoglobin and MCV .", "Anyone experienced bluish spots on tongue? Beta thal minor here. Has anyone experienced bluish spots on tongue? I have had dark blue/ red spots on my body, but this is a new development. I just wanted to check if it is normal. Are the spots bruises? Nope. Blood clots on my body. Not sure of the spots on tongue Beta thal minor also. \n\nI get some nasty blue/red bruises that take a long time to heal, but I do a lot of contact sports so that is not surprise. \n\nIf you are getting them on your tongue that might be something you need to talk to your doctor about. It might be a sign of something more serious. Checked with my GP. She asked me to get PT and other tests done if the symptoms recur. Keeping low right now. Did you ever find out what is causing it? Doctor said it could have been one of the capillaries that burst and got clotted. I have had similar blood clots over my body. My PT normally varies from 6-10 mins which is borderline and not alarm worthy. Well at least it is not dangerous. It can be dangerous if I get into an accident or decide to give birth. I have learnt that having borderline blood work is bad - doctors will not treat you because it is not as bad as regular patients, and you continue to have symptoms and suffer. Cannot blame doctors even, as not much study has gone into this field. I am scared to have children too. I always fear there is a bleeding risk they will not take seriously until it is too late. What blood test did they do? BT, CT, PT, APTT, Von Willebrand - the works. I was referred to a Haematologist 9 years back by my Ob-gyn because of my abnormally long and heavy periods. Get these tests done if you have bleeding issues on top of current thal challenges. These will help decide if you need factor 9 or other clotting agents after you give birth. Its better to be safe and know what can and can not affect you. Normally thal minors do not have any problems in child birth other than their haemoglobin dropping low in last trimester. Stay positive! \ud83d\ude42 I am about to see a hematologist for the first time in my life. I will definitely keep these tests in mind! I do have heavy periods off and on.

It actually has helped me but I do a bunch of other stuff as well. You should probably get some bloodwork done. Talk to your doc but depending on your situation you should check your b and d vitamin levels as well as a complete blood count. Can I ask what else you do? Well the stuff I do is specific to me and my health conditions. I would not recommend you do any of that stuff without consulting a qualified doctor or dietician. I have a list of supplements I take that may or may not do anything for you. When is the last time you got bloodwork done? Ah gotcha, I go in at least once a year.

Hope you are feeling alright now \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude42\n\nSo far I have only experienced minor greying out after recovering from a squat position. Last around 10 seconds but I will be fine afterwards. Have not fainted before, luckily When I would go vegan it would happen.  Red meat 1-2x a week was the only thing that helped.  I tried even the best supplements while being vegan and would not do it.  I do not know what the difference is, but the meat does the trick as much as I hate to say it. Could you have eaten something bad? It almost sounds like food poisoning. We have to be careful about what we eat. I had spicy food earlier and regretting it now.

Thanks very much for sharing your dad's experience; sounds like something I need to be wary off since I always write-off my tummy aches.\n\n\nMy stomach's very sensitive towards selected foods too, anything that it dislikes will cause me the runs. Specialist said it is not irritable bowel syndrome or lactose-intolerance \ud83d\ude12 and when I get really bad runs, next thing I know I would be greying out; same thing when I get bad migraines \ud83d\ude23 I guess it makes sense since severe pain causes low blood pressure, which leads to greying and blacking out. This happens to me every couple of months. I always wondered if it was related to thalassemia. I know this is a long shot, but you sound like you also might be a candidate for having a gluten allergy. \n\nLike you, I had a long list of foods I avoided..it seemed everything was making my stomach unhappy.  \n\nI lived for years not knowing that it was actually just one ingredient killing me.  I wish I had known so much earlier. \n\nMaybe try cutting out the glutens for 30 days? This IS a possibility. I was pain-free when I tried keto diet (high fat low carbs) for 1-2 months; but the psychological side effects was too much for me to continue with the diet.\n\nI might look into cutting down gluten in other ways. Thanks for the advice! Good luck! Psychologically, you will adapt!  \n\nThere is lots of great gluten-free pastas and okay breads.

I did not absorb the folic acid as well as I absorb optimized folate. Folic acid helps your body make red blood cells, but people with MTHFR mutation/inherited hemoglobinopathies (i.e Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Anemia, G6PD Deficiency) have reduced amounts of L- methylfolate or in layman's terms, they have folate deficiency which can lead to anemia.

Oxidative stress, which has been a topic of considerable investigation, is implicated in a growing list of diseases to include the thalassaemia . The antioxidant taurine has been considered among the very useful antioxidants that showed striking effects both therapeutically and protectively in different diseases . Taurine was not considered in thalassaemias, and no data was found in the literature about the determination or use of taurine in thalassaemias. Therefore, from the present work we aimed at the evaluation of the serum level of taurine in \u03b2-thalassaemia subjects, and also evaluating the effect of oral taurine on lipid profile, liver functions, and coagulation time in \u03b2-thalassaemia carriers.\n\n&gt; Serum taurine was measured by HPLC in 14 \u03b2-thalassaemia majors, 22 \u03b2-thalassaemia carriers, and 17 normal subjects. In addition, oral taurine (1000 mg/day) was supplemented to the carriers for 8 weeks.\n\n&gt; **Results indicated that both patients  and carriers  for \u03b2-thalassaemia have significantly low serum taurine levels compared to normal subjects (p &lt; 0.05).** The reduction of serum taurine was more pronounced in patients than in carriers compared to normal controls the values of which were: 43.23 \u00b1 2.45, 49.86 \u00b1 3.76, 56.55 \u00b1 4.60 mmol/l respectively.\n\n&gt; Although taurine supplementation (1000 mg/day) for 8 weeks did not result in any significant changes in the lipid profile of \u03b2-thalassaemia carriers, however, **it resulted in a significant amelioration in the activity of liver enzymes (AST &amp; ALT)** which showed an upper-limit baseline values, the effect of taurine supplementation on ALT was more pronounced than the effect on AST.\n\n&gt; Moreover, the results regarding the coagulation time in \u03b2-thalassaemia carriers revealed a hypercoagulable state with a baseline coagulation time (301.32 \u00b1 44.66 sec) significantly lower than normal controls (337.40 \u00b1 47.68 sec). Interestingly, **oral taurine improved the coagulation time in the carriers, improvements were reported as early as the 4th week of supplementation (307.59 \u00b1 39.64 sec) and continued also at the 8th week (325.5 \u00b1 35.11 sec).**\n\n&gt; In the present work, clinical trial of taurine supplementation on \u03b2-thalassaemia majors was not possible, because those patients are under the management protocol provided by the haematology department at the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Therefore, we evaluated the patients biochemically and compared their parameters with carriers and normal controls.\n\n&gt; It is worth mention that the values of serum taurine in patients were statistically lower than those values of carriers and controls. The correlation and linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between the reduction in serum taurine and the degree of iron overload in those patients (r^2 = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) and the complications of in \u03b2-thalassaemia disease as reported by the increased activities of AST &amp; ALT (r^2 = 0.63 &amp; 0.61 respectively) and the hypercoagulable state (r^2 = 0.65) which showed a coagulation time of 271.29 \u00b1 23.37 sec. **It was concluded that \u03b2-thalassaemia disorder is associated with a depleted levels of serum taurine, which justifies the necessity for clinical evaluation of oral taurine in \u03b2-thalassaemic patients which may ameliorate the complications specially for those with improper management and chelation therapy.**\n\n", "An inspiring story of a Thalassemia patient who helps fulfil dreams of Thalassemia children ", "Iron side effects Hi everyone!

Hi \n\nthalassemia does not directly imply anemia even though your blood iron level are lower than normal. You just need less iron by design. But you can also get anemia while having thalassemia. Being female probably makes you more vulnerable. \n\nThere is a way to know if you really have anemia. Something related to the Mentzer Index. But it is complicated.

The iron supplements that are normally given are very hard on the stomach and can erode the stomach lining leading to gastritis. Trust me, you do not want gastritis.\n\nHere is something that helped me understand a little more: \n\nAll in all, I would advise you to go to the hospital whenever you do not feel well. But be very careful not to take the wrong iron supplements or iron at all unless you really have anemia. Communicate openly and thoroughly with your doctor to consider the possibilities. And lifestyle changes can help protect you further down the road.\n\nI wish you good luck. When my ferritin level was 3ng/ml earlier this year, my doctor immediately ordered iron infusions. My hemoglobin went from 9.3 to 10.6 within a few weeks of the infusions. \n\nHave you spoken to the doctor who tested your blood about the results and what they recommend?\n\nMy low iron was the result of years of heavy periods, which could be the case for you, but if not, doctors like to try to find the cause for low iron in addition to treating it (could be a stomach/bleeding issue, etc.).\n\nHope you find out more and get treatment soon! ", "The levels of nitric oxide in beta-thalassemia minor. **The levels of nitric oxide in beta-thalassemia minor.**\n--\n\n\n\nAbstract\n--\n\n**OBJECTIVE:**\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between NO (nitric oxide) and beta-thalassemia minor.\n\n**METHODS:**\nA total of 60 patients with beta-thalassemia minor (30 M, 30 F) were included in the study. The control group consisted of 60 healthy subjects (30 M, 30 F). Plasma nitrite/nitrate levels were measured using the Griess reaction method and analyzed by spectrophotometry at 545 nm.\n\n**RESULTS:**\nPlasma direct nitrite, total nitrite and nitrate levels were 7.561\u00b16.19, 42.548\u00b17.37 and 34.84\u00b16.24 in beta-thalassemia minor patients versus 36.9\u00b119.8, 85.9\u00b135.3 and 48.61\u00b117.35 \u00ccmol/dl in controls, respectively. Plasma direct nitrite, total nitrite and nitrate levels were significantly lower in beta-thalassemia minor patients compared with the control group (p&lt;0.001).\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThese findings confirm that plasma NO levels in beta-thalassemia minor patients are decreased at the time of diagnosis. This may be helpful in assessing the prognosis and follow-up evaluation of patients with beta-thalassemia minor.\n\nLab Data\n--\n | Thal Minor Patients | Control Group | p Value\n---|---|----|----\nCarbonic anhydrase (%) | 1.156 \u00b1 0.354 | 2.085 \u00b1 0.421 | p&lt;0.001\nDirect nitrite (\u03bcmol/dl) | 7.561 \u00b1 6.198 | 36.963 \u00b1 19.833 | p&lt;0.001\n\ufffcTotal nitrite | 42.548 \u00b1 7.379 | 85.975 \u00b1 35.286 | p&lt;0.001\nNitrate (\u03bcmol/dl) | 34.845 \u00b1 6.249 | 48.613 \u00b1 17.359 | p&lt;0.001\n\nInteresting Quotes\n--\n\n&gt; Hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis are currently considered sources of strong oxidative stress. Reports have shown that the free heme and the red cell membrane elements that are produced during hemolysis have a negative effect on NO and arginine availability, which in turn promotes vasoconstriction. They also lead to further endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a more pronounced NO reduction. In hemoglobinopathies, NO binds very rapidly to deoxyhemoglobin, forming a stable Hb (Fe+2)-NO complex. NO also reacts with and converts oxygenated hemoglobin to methemoglobin and nitrate (NO3-). Rates of intravascular NO scavenging are reduced significantly when hemoglobin is sequestered within red cell membranes.\n\n---\n\n&gt; Pathological processes in thalassemia accelerate the destruction of NO, and limit the compensatory increase in NO production. Hemoglobin decompartmentalized from the red cell into blood plasma by intravascular hemolysis reaches steady-state levels of 5-10 \u03bcM, at times exceeding 50 \u03bcM. This hemoglobin reacts with NO in a rapid, nearly diffusion-limited reaction to produce methemoglobin and inert nitrate. In addition, NO is also consumed by reaction with reactive oxygen species produced as a by-product of the highly expressed enzymatic activities of xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase. Lastly, more recent studies suggest that hemolysis leads to uncoupling of endothelial NO synthase activity, likely secondary to heme-mediated oxidative damage to the enzyme, also producing reactive oxygen species. These mechanisms may combine additively to markedly accelerate NO destruction.\n\n---\n\n&gt; Arginase activity is elevated in red blood cells of thalassemia patients and is likely related to reticulocytosis, since immature cells and reticulocytes are known to contain a high concentration of arginase. It is therefore likely that erythrocyte release of arginase during hemolysis will limit the availability of arginine to nitric oxide synthase, resulting in a deficiency of NO and dysregulation of arginine metabolism in thalassemia patients through a similar mechanism identified in sickle cell disease.\n\n---\n\n&gt; ***Multiple mechanisms directly and indirectly attributable to hemolysis reduce NO bioavailability in thalassemia. The resulting impairment in NO bioavailability is associated with vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis.*** Autopsy findings in thalassemia, particularly pulmonary thrombi, have been observed in patients who had previously undergone splenectomy.\n\n---\n\n&gt; In conclusion, low NO levels are thought to be related to the chronic hemolysis. Supportive treatment of hemolytic anemia hemolysis may increase the NO bioavailability, which may be helpful in assessing the prognosis and follow-up of the patients.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n As mentioned in the quote above, the main remedy seems to be to minimize hemolysis by (a) maintaining good antioxidant status (vitamins A, C, E, zinc, selenium) (b) having a diet rich in other antioxidants (i.e. fruits and vegetables) and (c) maintaining good B vitamin status in order to build strong red blood cells. You can also supplement with taurine which is an antioxidant ( in Thals.\n\nOnce you have taken care of the basics, you can experiment with boosting nitric oxide. The most effective way seems to be by eating more nitrate-rich vegetables like arugula, beets, etc. Since arginine levels are depleted in Thal, it might also help to increase arginine levels. There are several supplements that can do this: L-Arginine, L-Citrulline, etc. L-Citrulline ( to increase arginine levels better than L-Arginine itself, so it seems to be the first one worth trying.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a doctor, just a random person researching for themselves.\n I am experimenting with this now. Arginine-butyrate was used at chemo dosages with good results but only saw one research study and no follow-up.\n\nL-Citrulline was already mentioned but another option is Agmatine (but you cant take it the same time as L-Citrulline or L-Arginine, you have to stagger the dosage times).\n\nI am also currently experimenting with an antidepressant that boosts NO at the nervous system level/brain chemistry with good effect.\n\nSomething else to look into is Ecdysteroids (plant hormones). I had good success with them in High School as an athlete. Am beginning to pick up experimenting with it again at the age of 31yo.", "Can you have Thalassemia with nearly normal MCHC and Hemoglobin? Having an issue with my daughter (19 yrs) with fainting, fatigue and low level headaches (that last weeks). We just found out that my grandfather has Thalassemia. She had barely low hemoglobin (11) and MCHC. Her doctor wants her to take iron but I have read that is not good for people with Thalassemia. We have good insurance and I could just bring her to a hematologist. However, perhaps they are right. Could she had Thalassemia with fairly normal MCHC and hemoglobin? I have Thalassemia minor and all my indices are normal except for MCV which is slightly lower than the reference range.  My hematologist said to never take iron without iron studies.  I am a woman and doctors always want to give me iron because of menstruation.  I recommend seeing a hematologist and possibly a nutritionist too.  I get all my iron from food and my iron levels are in the upper reference range.  I also had the same symptoms your daughter has but with a diet change and exercise it all went away.  Also, I have liver damage from all the iron and medications I was given as a child before I was diagnosed.  Please request to see a specialist, generalists do not really know what they are talking about when it comes to these things. May I ask if you have Alpha or Beta Thalassaemia?\n\nI have Alpha, and am  waiting to see a hematologist, before starting iron supplements. Thank you for the reply. She was sent home from her university because of coronavirus so I 'm going to take her to a hematologist. I have Beta Thalassemia Trait and that is the first thing I would do before taking any iron supplements. May I ask more details about your liver damage? I also have beta T minor and possible liver damage (ALT, AST a bit off for as long as I remember + sonography shows enlarged liver) but I have never taken iron as supplement. I am curious if it is possible if the liver damage for you is purely a result of iron and other meds you took as a child or maybe Thalassemia can cause liver damage independent of meds. Thanks.", "Sharp left arm and chest pain does anyone else have this? Lately been having sharp left arm and chest pains did this happen to anyone else? Call 911 and go to the hospital. I am in the hospital now actually. Got kind of spooked. Why did you suggest that? Pain down the left arm is a heart attack symptom yup, nothing to do with thal, good call going to hospital Correct but it is also symptoms of other things. It also was not down the left arm it was just a sharp pain in my left arm then it went to my right arm then the back of both arms. Had this last year. Pain in the mid arm and left chest.\n\nI was on ibuprofen for lower back pain for about 5 days when it happened.\n\nAt the emergency, they did not find anything that could explain it.

Hello everyone\n\nMy doctor thinks I have Thalassemia and I am getting tested for it. My entire life my RBC have been high, alongside other indicators on CBC that point to this disease.  However, I recently received my bloodwork from years past and noticed another doctor did the Hemoglobin Electrophoresis test before and the values were normal, though two were just BARELY normal, like 1 point off. Can I still have a form of Thalassemia with a normal result? My main symptoms are fatigue upon exertion, shortness of breath in high altitude / exercise, cold feet/hands, lower body temp at times, paleness. I also have hypothyroidism that is controlled. My Ferritin is normal but Iron Binding Capacity and Iron Binding revealed to be high, which to my knowledge indicates iron deficiency?  It is all so confusing. Any insights?", "How do you guys feel about family planning? How do you feel about possibly passing your illness to your kids? Note (english is not my first language i apologize for any spelling and punctuation errors)\nI am writing my nursing graduation paper on the subject of family planning with genetic illness and i would like to understand your views and standpoints from a closer perspective. Do you want kids? how do you feel about passing on your illness? would you consider genetic testing with your partner? Do you consider IVF?\nAny replies are much aprechiated! I do not plan to have or want kids so it was easy to think about lol. \nAside from my thal my boyfriend has cystic fibrosis so both hereditary illnesses. Even without the fact I do not want kids I would just adopt if we did. This exactly! I want kids. Luckily my partner is Portuguese and we know that he does not carry beta thalassemia like I do. We both agreed that if he carried it or like sickle cell that we would not have kids. We would have to consider other ways, like genetic testing or adoption etc. I find it annoying enough as it is just having beta thalassemia minor, I would find it far to cruel the risk of having a kid with major. But that is just me personally. I am glad that we are aware of our carrier status before trying for kids. I am beta thal minor, I had 2 kids and both also have it. Since it is rather minor we were not concerned, but we did get genetic testing done just to be sure my husband was not a carrier too (he was not). And with that found out I was a carrier for a whole other much more serious genetic disease. But since my husband was not a carrier, it was fine. I am very young (22, turning 23 soon), and I am on the fence about having kids in the future (for reasons unrelated to my thalassemia). Obviously that is a very long way off since I am currently still in school. I am Jewish (Ashkenazi, so lots of fun diseases, thankfully I only have beta thal minor) and it is likely I will marry someone who is also Jewish, I have always known that, so it is been my plan to do genetic testing if my partner does not know what their genetic makeup is if we plan on having children.  If my partner also has beta thal minor, then I would definitely look into adoption. I would definitely not want the possibility of passing on thal major to any child. Not to minimize the suffering of those who currently have thal major, but I just could not do that. If my partner does not have any genetic illnesses (which I find unlikely because many Ashkenazi Jews are vulnerable to a number of genetic illnesses, though I am not an expert on that), then I would go ahead and have children naturally, since my thal minor has not affected me in any way (other than me being super pale). Passing on the trait was not a factor in my decision making. But my own health was. I do not want kids I am to exhausted to take care of. Some days when my hemoglobin is particularly low I am literally in bed at 6pm. My partner is amazing but he works away from home so I would have to be the primary caregiver and that is just not a commitment I could make. I am a beta thal major thank you for your reply! may i ask what that other disease is? It was spinal muscular atrophy. I got an in depth carrier screen and my partner will have one as well. If we both carry the same mutations we will definitely consider other options such as IVF. No matter what I plan to meet with a geneticist prior to making any decisions. I just found out I am Alpha Thal Minor in December. Though I am in my late 30s, prior to that diagnosis, I was still kind of hoping to have kids one day. \nBut that killed my desire to, I am single and it feels like an odd conversation to have with a new guy. Plus, I do not want to risk putting my kids in this same position where they would have to make a choice. I am not sure of the exact form of thalassemia I have, but it is minor (assuming Beta minor as uncle has Beta major). I do not want to take any chances and would prefer adopting a child as if the child somehow has Beta major, they are going to not have the best of lives. Hence I would prefer providing a home to a kid instead of having one You can marry someone out of your area a proverb tells \"go far from your blood it can wets you \" \nNow with progress in science we have discovered a lot of genetic disorders and diseases that due to family marriages .", "Covid-19 and Beta-thalassemia So I am thinking if B-Thalassemia can have a protective effect against covid-19 because:\n\n* Anti-malarial drugs being used to treat covid-19.\n* Provinces in Italy with high prevalence of thalassemias, like Sardinia, having lower rates of cov-19 infection and mortality. \\( \\(\n* Papers about how ( coming out.\n\nWhat is your opinion? More southerly provinces are warmer too. That may reduce transmission rates. There is mixed research and information about this as to whether the effect is real though. One of the research articles I saw on chlorhixadine was poor. Looks like they were p-hacking ie trying to make the research look better than it really is. Jury is still out on this one I have also beta thalassemia minor, and have exactly the same idea. Maybe we are somehow protected from covid19 also. But do not want to test that on myself if you get my point. We will not know until months or years have gone by and the research is more thorough. There is no harm in wishful thinking though. It is hard to stay positive during these times. if this turns out to be true, what a twist that for once we are the ones with the Good Blood^(TM) lmao. staying tuned for further research with cautious optimism! How about alpha thalassemia? I think people with alpha thalassemia have a normal beta chain of hemoglobin and so far I have not seen anything about the interaction of the coronavirus and the alpha chain of hemoglobin. Alpha thalassemia is also much more uncommon in Europe. SoooooOoOOO I have a rare form of BThal- I have intermedia I believe. Instead of making one/two altered forms of Beta Globin, I have the form where you only make one normal. For the science geeks I have an autosomal dominant form of Beta Thalassemia due to a nonsense mutation that results in a premature stop codon, resulting in a loss of function. I wonder how my form applies- I feel like I could be at greater risk. I am new to this. Do you think we are protected against COVID-19 due to beta-zero? Something about our beta chains. The virus apparently bonds with the ( on hemoglobin cells, destroying the cell. While this appears to be a sort of a secondary effect of the virus as its main objective is to infect the lungs, it makes the disease more serious as lower hemoglobin leads to hypoxia which can be fatal. We produce mutant beta globin  protein, that most likely have a protective effect. Ok. \nNow I am seeing that theory was debunked or something. Confusing. The mechanism of how the virus affects hemoglobin is up for debate. The study I linked is based on computer simulations so it may not be totally correct but the fact that coronaviruses affect hemoglobin is not something new, in fact there are papers from the previous sars coronavirus outbreak mentioning this: ( i have beta minor and have been extra scared about covid-19 possibly posing a bigger threat to me. this is really comforting to read about even if only a very tiny part of my brain believes it could be true! Sorry, I was not clear. I meant the part about displacing iron. It is an hypothesis, it will unfortunately take time to get proven right or wrong. Not sure what to make of it, but there is a more recent discussion about COVID-19 and Thalassemia here:  Sort of an ignorant theory by the guy saying since black people tend to have Thalassemia more and more of them are dying from Covid-19, maybe there is a link. \n\nAny race can have thalassemia and the high risk groups tend to be people who are obese, diabetic, or people with hypertension. Or people over the age of 65...\n\nJust do not see the logic there.", "Thalassemia and corona. I have thalassemia b, found out when I was 10. I am 30 now, never knew there was a community! \nI was wondering if anyone here has gotten covid 19? Care to share the experience? \n\nI am about to go back to work (long term care home) and there is a current outbreak. I am pretty healthy i would say. No smoking, normal blood pressure, exercise 6 days a week and drink vitamins daily. I have prepped myself for covid as best as I could, just worried that the thalassemia would land me in the hospital. Take care of yourself. CDC says people with thalassemia might be at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19:\n\n(\n\nI had a scare this week with what I hope is only a cold. I took a rapid test over the weekend that was negative at first but the center called me back to say it was faintly positive resulting in inconclusive results. Hoping my PCR test comes back negative, so far though, if I am truly positive, it has been mild, and has felt like a cold and not the flu or any fever or anything crazy.\n\nI work out six days a week and eat vitamins. I have been pretty much sheltering in place but having thalassemia means being super susceptible to illness. If I were you \u2014 I would not be returning to work especially at a long term home care facility where the virus is running rampant. We have a family member who drives a van for one who tested positive for it this week. I know it is not always possible to stay home to work, but if it is at all possible for you, I would strongly advise you do so.\n\nAlso, thalassemia means you already carry oxygen poorly. This virus attacks the respiratory system meaning our already weak ability to carry oxygen would be exacerbated. Working out all the time does nothing more than make us feel normal at best. Once you get sick you will not be able to work out so any of those things you think are benefits are meaningless the moment you cannot anymore. I have been in bed for three days now sick and can already feel the ill affects of having thalassemia and not being able to be as active to counteract the symptoms.\n\nSeriously, do not think for a second that just because you feel good normally that it means anything when your body is under duress. I had it, thalassemia beta minor. Did not really feel sick tbh. I am 21 years old pretty healthy diet, workout 6x a week, do not really do cardio though. I would not stress so hard about it. I currently have it and am thalassemia beta minor. It basically has felt like a bad sinus infection, nothing terrible. Im 28/F and workout a few times a week and am generally healthy. I have researched a lot and so far it seems that there has not been any correlation between thalassemia and poorer outcomes, especially if you have minor/trait. Some argue that it may even offer protection. This theory is based on the idea that SARS-COV-2 may attack blood cells. Thal. minors often have roughly 20% more RBC. Inefficient, I may also add. I agree with \u201cegoash\u201d.  This is also goes for malaria as well. Finally- potential benefits of thalassemia! Thanks guys! \nI actually started to work again (no choice tbh) also had my first dose of Pfizer vaccine! So far so good. Just pain in my arm and the feeling just before you get to the 37.8. \nAny of you all got it yet? I have read similar studies too. It interests me how there are conflicting studies on something that should be a simple \u201cyes or no\u201d. The CDC says we are more at risk while other findings suggest we may be immune to COVID-19 I, personally, am not going to screw with it. I will be trying to avoid COVID. :) Yeah it is not something worth risking. It is just frustrating to be told we are immune, but also be told we have a greater chance of dying lol I am late posting on this thread. But, I had COVID-19, I was very sick.

We have different dads but our mom is very anemic and does iron transfusions at the hospital (She never checked herself for thalassemia). And her dad is healthy in that area.\n\nI did blood tests and through maple (online doctors platform) got a doctor that talked to me less than 5 minutes, told me I have iron deficiency and prescribed me with iron supplements but told me to go see a doctor in person soon..   \nI was happy that whatever I have is fixable.\n\nI am taking iron supplmenets for almost 3 months now but I do not feel better.. I cannot go see a doctor in person.

Oh thank you so much for your answer! I will check if my health insurance covers it and for sure do that!! Thank you so much for your response. I have been taking iron on and off for most of my life as well. Never really cared until the symptoms became too much. The only reason my first doctor thought of thal is because she heard I am middle eastern lol.\n\nI will go to a private doctor then. Thank you! I will for sure!! Thank you! Ok first your ferritin is low. This means that your body has a low amount of iron stored (this is a simplified explanation). Other important numbers are your MCV and MCH, aka mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Looking at your clinical picture I think it would beneficial to pull all this information together (family history, blood test results, and symptoms) and make an appointment with another doctor who is more knowledgeable.

Hi, I have these pressures to varying degrees. I do not know the exact cause but I have some theories and some ideas of what may help.\n\nI believe stress is the main cause. Particularly stress due to long focus sessions, like long meetings or long study/reading/concentrating, etc. \n\nBut stress in what way ? Stress caused by muscle contractions. Particularly muscles of the jaw, neck, back, etc coupled with low oxygen.\n\nWhat I do is just massage by jaws, neck, upper and lower back after long focus sessions. It really helps so I got a vibrating massager for it. It does not prevent it but makes the recovery faster.\n\nSo in brief, you need to find the triggers and be mindful about them and do something for recovery. Also look up TMJ.\n\nAs for lightheadedness, could be related to blood sugars, sitting for too long, \u2026\n\nHope this helps and good luck. I think it is called cervigenic dizziness.

I know I have some sort of thalassemia minor that is caused by some recessive gene I have got from my mom. However, since it has basically no effect on my life my doctor gave me no medication, etc and only advised me for genetic counselling if I ever want to have a kid.\n\nHowever, something I seriously struggled with was my sleep. I tend to sleep long hours and wake up late in the mornings which caused some productivity issues for me. When I compare myself to my friends, they wake up early in the morning no problem but for me it is the hardest part of my day. I am not depressed, etc but the exact opposite. I am so motivated and hardworking but really cannot do anything about it no matter whatever strategy I tried. I think that is more a sleep hygiene problem Thanks for your reply. I was a deep sleeper as long as I remember. I can even trace its signs to when I was a kid. That is why I was thinking about some biological source rather than the hygiene part. I will look deeper into my sleep routine, thanks. Yeah for sure, I mean anything is possible I cannot say for sure one way or another, but thalassemia you would be feeling it throughout the day as well usually. Sleep is hard to pin point as everyone sleeps different and there are so many factors that can change your sleep. I have the same issue but I have alpha thalassemia hemoglobin H with Constant Spring which is closer to thal major. I get very fatigued if I do any physical activity or just standing/walking for a long time, but I also am always sleepy even though I sleep for 10-12 hours a night. I went to a sleep doctor once since I thought they might help me fix it, but they told me I have bad sleep hygiene which I thought was annoying because even when I try good sleep hygiene I am still tired and have trouble falling asleep. I have the same issue as well. I have tried going to bed earlier (10pm-11pm), getting 8 hours of sleep at least but I still tend to struggle the most in the morning to wake up. I set a media alarm around 7:00am and an actual alarm at 7:30 but I still find it hard to wake up. Without an alarm I can sleep till 10am and still be tired. I also find it hard to fall asleep at times \nHow long have you been been waking up at the same hour everyday? \nHow long have you been constantly getting 7-8hrs of sleep?\n\nSleep is a habit that revolves around your environment, job, household, and your personal health.\n\nIt will take months to develop a good sleeping habit. That habit should conform to what the experts say: get 8 hrs of sleep, manage diet and phys, and wake up at the same hour everyday. You have been told by an expert you have bad sleep hygiene; and when you say \"try\", how long  and how often did you try to implement the experts' advise? I admit I was not very diligent in promoting good sleep hygiene for a super long time. I have trouble maintaining a consistent wake up time especially on the weekends when I want to sleep in, but I did other things like no caffeine past 2pm, or no naps for a couple of weeks-months I need like 10 hours of sleep a night, I am in bed by 9pm. During my period I am sleepy all day.", "Did anyone else subsequently find out they have middle eastern heritage from their diagnosis? ", "My partner and I both have Thalassemia minor.

Some of my Indian friends have it running in their family, so maybe it is a local concern, especially in communities where cousins marry. lmao what?  \nI am Indian and no, nobody in my family married anyone for me to be Thal Major. It is a genetic trait and so is passed to children by parents who carry the gene... the chance of inheriting it is higher if both parents have it. There are lots of second and third cousin marriages too within families and a lot of times you do not even know because it is not talked about it or because you do not make that connection while reading the names of the bride and groom family members listed out on the wedding card, lol.

Both know several people who have it and have said that the tradition of people preferring to marry inside the same caste/community over several generations is one reason why it is gotten so bad in some areas.\n\nAnd if it makes you feel any better, it is not taboo to marry certain cousins in India and almost every family has had at least one cousin marriage, at least in generations before ours. It is not usually as genetically bad as people think - plus you know the family, it keeps the money in the family, etc. I understand what you are saying and know it well, as a carrier of the disorder myself. I have been living with it for 28 years so yes, I know how it works. However the theory you are staying is atleast 30-35 years old, if not older, towards the \"causation\" of how Thalassemia works. Over the years, despite the ruckus or if you want to call it PSAs, the intermingling between families has been prevented to a large extent. However, in Cyprus, which is as much as hub as tropical countries like India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, the problem persists. It is a na\u00efve view and a position to continue in 2020 that this has been directly and still contributing to the cause of Alpha Thalassemia and the Beta Thalassemia genes being passed around. \n\nAs Indians, most families take pride in matching astrological charts and other ilks which in anyway cannot prevent Thalassemia.

", "Just found out I am an alpha carrier. Pregnant. I am 8 weeks pregnant and my results just came back that I am a alpha carrier. My husband is from Cyprus with his dad being a carrier. He is getting tested next week to find out if he is a carrier. I am freaking out. If he is a carrier that is a 25% chance for major with our kid. I feel terrible. I wish I would have known about this. I had no idea and I am sad. Guess I am not looking for advice per se, just sad. Wishing all well. I have beta thalassemia minor(loss of 2 out of 4 alleles) and alpha Thalassemia carrier (loss of 1 out of 2 alleles).\n\nMy family has no idea who has which to make the combo, I am also the only one out of 4 blood related kids to have both. My siblings have been tested and are not even carriers for either. I also have none of the usual high risk ancestry and am full blown northern european/Scandinavian. \n\nI am on my second pregnancy. My 1st just turned 1 year old today and is doing great! Their father is not a carrier either though, but the doctors have no idea if my son is a carrier or not since I happen to have both the disorders on my own. \n\nHere is to hoping you guys get the 75% chance of the baby only being a carrier! Just hope that me being due with healthy baby number 2 in a week or so lets you have peace of mind that things can and do turn out fine with having the disorder! \n\nAlso if dad has beta thalassemia minor or trait, they should not interact and cause issues with alpha. It is a weird balance act/ different part of the blood that is effected. This definitely needs to be a conversation with your geneticist or doctor but an Alpha Thalassemia carrier is missing 1/4 genes. If your husband is missing 1/4 genes you will have a 25% chance of a child with Alpha Thalassemia minor (2 missing genes). If your husband is missing 2 genes there IS a chance of Alpha Thalassemia that causes more severe symptoms. This would be considered Hemoglobin H disease or Thalassemia Intermedia Wishing you the best", "Pregnant, finally confirmed beta thalassemia minor diagnosis My bloodwork always indicated anemia, but I have always told my doctors I am pretty sure it is thalassemia because of my Sicilian heritage and basically my entire extended family has thalassemia. It only took 26 years lol but I am glad to finally have it validated! \n\nMy OB set up an appointment for me to see a genetic counselor.. I am not really sure what the point of that will be? Will not they just say that my baby may or may not inherit it? It is not like I can do anything about it. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience with this? Or have an idea why they think I need this appointment?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks :) If you are beta thal minor, you carry the faulty gene (the trait) but it does not really affect your life.\n\nIf your partner also has beta thal minor, there is a 1 in 4 chance that your baby may be born with thalassemia major.  This is a big deal, it is a big enough deal that if you knew this beforehand you might choose not to have kids so that they do not risk getting this condition.  But they will be able to lead more or less a pretty normal life, but with ongoing treatment. Blood transfusions, bone marrow stuff.  idk i am not a doctor.\n\nSo I am guessing the genetic counsellor will want to explore this with you.\n\nIf you already know this, sorry for telling you stuff you already know.  If you did not know this, sorry to bring you potentially bad news. No this is really helpful thank you! I guess they will test my husband too then We are TTC now and just had a \\~8-week miscarriage. We did genetic counseling prior to trying and they said what the other commenter said, it is really only an issue if your partner also has the trait. After confirming pregnancy my OB did a CBC panel and checked my ferritin but everything seemed normal. She knew about my thalassemia going into my pregnancy and no other issues. FWIW, my mom passed the trait to her three kids and five of my confirmed nieces/nephews have it and the other two have not been tested yet. None of us have any issues except showing up aggressively anemic on all bloodwork. I have beta thal and now have an 8 week old. They will want to test your partner for the same and check your ferritin. Mine is usually normal but during pregnancy I had to take iron. Your hemoglobin is likely low as a baseline and will drop during pregnancy. Mine usually sits around 100. Normal for a woman is 120-150. Usually they would opt for an iron infusion but that does not apply if you have beta thal. Hgb of 70 for anyone usually means you get a blood transfusion... so this means you are more likely to require a blood transfusion after birth. I did not need one. Hope the info is useful to you! Oh no I am so sorry to hear about your loss. Sending big hugs! I am 9.5 weeks now and am still terrified of a MC. Im glad to hear there are not really any issues! Congrats on your little cutie! And that is interesting. My iron value came back as normal (128) but my HGB A Is low and my HGB A2 is high \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f &gt;My OB set up an appointment for me to see a genetic counselor.. I am not really sure what the point of that will be? Will not they just say that my baby may or may not inherit it?\n\nIt is standard to see the geneticist, as someone else said they want to talk about the possibility of major not minor. If it goes like my pregnancy, they will probably never test your kid for it if there is not a chance of major. My daughter is 20 months and once they confirmed my husband was not a carrier they never cared to test her for anything, they dropped it all together. (Expect for helping me struggle with anemia) So I still do not know if shes got it. \n\nHope the rest of your pregnancy goes well! Congrats on the baby!! Okay that is good to know!! Thanks for your input! And thanks :) That is the key of diagnosis of( beta) thalassemia we do hemoglobin electrophoresis in results \n\nDecreased HBA % human hemoglobin A \n\nIncreased  HBA 2 % ..  ..       ..      ...         A 2 \n\nIncreased  HBF  %  hemoglobin fetal \n\nIn that case BETA thalassemia trait are confirmed without more checks. You can check it by yourself first than pass to doctor \nFor example you check your daughter color if she is pale not yellow but pale and also her lips and interior of her eyes if that appear pale there is a probability of 90 % she is carrier . Shes a pretty pale kid. Shes 1 1/2 and had some issues with iron a few months ago, but it all cleared up with diet. Her hemoglobin is relatively normal too, but her doctor said shes still a little young to be sure either way. Yes its still young to determine if she is carrier by looking at but with blood check it will work as you have beta thal hemoglobin electrophoresis i think you need to confirm her diagnosis and she will be aware with it since she is young . I am honestly not too worried either way. It never bothered me until I started having a period anyway, so I have got a lot of time with her before it should bug her. That is how I was diagnosed. Hgb electrophoresis I was diagnosed with beta thal minor around 12 weeks pregnant, but I guess it was not serious enough for my OB to tell me anything except to take more iron. My baby ended up having alpha thal minor, which prompted my husband to get tested and he has alpha thal minor as well. My OB now recommended us to see a genetic counselor prior to another pregnancy. I dont know what to expect, I am a little scared tbh. \n\nIf you decide to see a genetic counselor, can you update us on your findings? Oh wow well that is good your baby does not have major then! And yes I def will! My appointment is on the 22nd and I will let you all know how it goes Yeah, I couldnt find any info (on google lol) about thalassemia inheritance if one parent has alpha minor and the other beta minor.\n\nI hope your appt is informative and most of all your baby is healthy! Sorry for your loss.  Did they feel the thalassemia had a role?  Needing more folic acid or iron ? I meant to update you all earlier but the appointment went really well! Honestly I did not really learn anything new as far as thalassemia goes (except for that the trait was evolved to combat malaria, pretty cool) and because my husband is definitely not Mediterranean/Asian/African and his blood work is always perfect they did not even bother testing him. I still have 25% chance of passing it to my baby but I already knew that lol.  Other than that my pregnancy should be normal as far as thalassemia goes \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "New lurker, 24M beta thalassemia guy. Does thalassemia minor need to be cured ? So I am thalassemia minor guy. I do not require regular blood transfusions but I have been crippled by other health issues. My first cousin (m30)is a thalassemia major unfortunately. His lifestyle and mine differ like night and day. He is an avid yogi, meditates 1 hour daily and takes extra care of his health. He gets transfusions once every 14 days. I on the other hand have got vices and I am deeply embarrassed if you have opened my profile and read my posting on other subs. So my health issues are limited to adhd and DNS septum but touchwood I am a normal guy. My hemoglobin goes upto 11 ng/dl  on my lucky days.\n\nSo where does thalassemia minor hit me ? Poor immunity and cognitive skills. I would appreciate if my fellow thalassemia minors share about their routine and supplements. Sending love to thalassemia major patients. Thanks. Are you alpha or beta? I have said in the title beta. Excuse me I am new to this terminology. In my country they call us \"thalassemia minor\" which means we have struggles with hemoglobin and immune system. But we do not require blood transfusions to remain alive. Got it, sorry I missed it in the title. I am also beta thalassemia minor. My average hemoglobin is around 7.5 and i mostly worry about anemia being caused by the thalassemia. Have you had your iron levels looked at? Not recently but last I checked, the doctor never warned me of low iron levels. 7.5 is scary. My mom is also beta she has struggled at 8 all her life. Not everyone with thalassemia has a problem with anemia, you may be one of those ppl but it may be worth looking into. I get tired sometimes, but mostly I am okay unless anemia strikes. I have not had many other issues since thalassemia minor is mostly unnoticed by most ppl who have it.  Have you looked into other issues that may be causing some of your difficulties? If you do think its thalassemia I would go see a hematologist, I personally get iron infusions (due to the anemia) and unlike iron pills it actually works well. I also take folic acid which helps as well but of course always talk to your doctor before starting anything Well, there is no cure. \n\nI am thal beta minor.  I am also a woman so the way it hits me is that I need transfusions when I am pregnant and it has made staying pregnant much harder than the average person.  Also anytime I have surgery, it seems to hit me harder than most and takes longer for me to recuperate. \n\nI take folate, b12, b6, and wheat grass. That seems to help. Taking supplements keeps my hemoglobin in the 10s, when I am not supplementing it is usually in the 9s.  I get transfused in the 7s.  I have found cardio, like running, exceedingly hard for me, but strength training has been a life saver. I am also beta thal minor and adhd and formerly deviated septum! I had a septoplasty so that was corrected not long ago.\n\nHalf of my family is also beta thal minor but have far fewer symptoms than me. My biggest complaint has always been fatigue, second are the cognitive issues from adhd/depression/anxiety.\n\nDo you exercise and eat healthy? Is your BMI high? I ask because I was getting sick all the time when I was overweight. After losing the weight, I get a cold no more than twice a year. But obviously everyone is different.\n\nHave you tried dna analysis like 23andme? I found I had some genes working against me like MTHFR requiring methyl folate, and a couple other pains-in-the-butt like COMT (messes with dopamine). \n\nAnd last one - are you medicated for adhd? I have been on a stimulant on and off for about a year. I take it when I can because my tolerance is all over the place. It helps with focus, motivation, mood, energy, etc., but as time goes on the evening comedowns get worse no matter what I try. Magnesium and electrolytes help the headaches, but nothing helps the evening depression and heaviness I feel all over.\n\nI eat healthy and count my calories. I have always been inconsistent with exercise but I am trying to build up a daily HIIT routine lately. Crossing my fingers exercise will help! \n\nAs for supplements, I have tried so so many. And still trying some. Currently: D3, B12 (methyl was okay, giving hydroxy a shot now), B2, B3, B6, zinc, iodine, fish oil, probiotic, methyl folate (occasionally), TMG, l-carnitine, CDP choline, inositol, NAC, C, K 1/2... I think that is it right now... lord XD\n\nLet me know if I can answer anything! My mother needed transfusions while pregnant with me (she is beta thal minor too) and just one of the many reasons I am terrified of pregnancy.\n\nThe surgery bit is interesting. I had my first surgery earlier this year - a septoplasty - and I thought it was all in my head that recovery was so tough. I was told I could go back to work after the first week, but I was cutting my work days short everyday because I felt so awful for the first month. I am on month 4 and STILL not quite back into the swing of things.\n\nCan I ask more about your experience with surgery and how long full recovery took? My sister and I are beta thalassemia minor and she did not need transfusions when pregnant so hopefully you will be in the same camp That is odd.. I am 16 weeks pregnant now and my Dr never said anything about needing transfusions my sister did not need them either with any of her pregnancies I wonder if there is different levels of that minor When I was fasting (as I did intermittent fasting for health) I was great but now that I am pregnant it is kicking my ass lol im thal minor as well once I stopped fasting and counting calories I started to get really sick again not sure why maybe it helped? I also used to drink 3l of water a day and take a multi vitamin daily (I still take a vitamin) and I walked 20-25,000 steps a day maybe a combination of all that helped me might help you too! I do not think it is all that common, actually. My mom needed transfusions while pregnant with me, but did not while pregnant with my sister. One of the transfusions was right after birth, so more related to blood loss than the Thalassemia alone. I am the opposite, cardio I can do fine if I stay below my maximum heart rate but if I do too much strength training I feel flushed, and even heart palpitations sometimes. Can I ask why strength trainer is a life saver. I think I have minor and am super into fitness and weight lifting. Just got my bloods done on blood count and pretty much everything is out of whack :/", "Is it true that thal minors age faster than normal? I once read that the French soccer player Zenoddin Zeidan had to retire early because of his thalassemia.  Is this true in general?\n\nI myself am in my late 30s and am already on TRT and I feel so fatigued it is like I am not going to live long. I take various supplements and workout 5-6 days  a week to be able to just go through day to day activities. Same here, and I am only a minor. Cannot imagine what majors go through. What is your diet like and what supplements are you taking? Diet and supplements have helped me immensely. I cannot keep up with my peers but still much better than I used to be.\n\nThings that have worked for me:\n\n* High protein, moderate carb, low fat diet. I think the low fat helps because it causes red blood cells to stick less. Not sure though.\n* (\n* Creatine\n* (\n* ( Granted this was a study on majors but minors experience a milder version of this. I did an amino acid test and  Same here, and I am only a minor. Cannot imagine what majors go through. What is your diet like and what supplements are you taking? Diet and supplements have helped me immensely. I cannot keep up with my peers but am much better than I used to be. My diet is like keto but I eat beans too. I think there are other factors involved in thalassemia in addition to anemia. My last HGB reading was 13.5 which is not bad. My folic acid was 18.3 in a 8.6 to 58.9 normal range which means it can be improved. However taking more than 100% RDV of methylfolate seems to make me feel bad (probably because of inadequate absorption). ALCAR makes me feel bad too. B12 and CoQ10 have been the best suppls for me. What about you? Interesting, I have to keep my fat intake low because I notice that my circulation becomes worse when I eat a lot of fat. My diet is moderate protein (100-150g), high carb (300-400g), low fat (10-20g). All whole foods, no refined carbs, lots of veggies. I experimented with different ratios and that is what seems to make me feel the best. I did a nutritional test which showed that my body was burning more amino acids for energy than normal, not sure if that is a Thal minor thing or just me. My muscle achiness improved when I increased my protein.\n\nI agree that anemia is not the whole story. I have felt fine when my HGB was around 11 and I have felt terrible when my HGB was around 13.\n\nThe supplements that helped me the most are:\n\n* ( This helped a lot with neurological and digestive issues especially, if that applies to you. I think it is good to take regardless.\n* Creatine. Made a noticeable difference in mental and physical energy, but I have other genetic mutations which may be the reason for that (MTHFR).\n* ( Might be worth trying a non-acetylated version of carnitine to see if that works better for you. I take fumarate personally.\n* ( Granted this was a study on majors but minors experience a milder version of this. I did an amino acid test and it showed low tyrosine like the study says (along with lowish glutamine and highish glutamate). My tyrosine levels were actually lower than the majors! Tyrosine helped a lot with mental focus, energy, and made me want to exercise more. The other supplements made a noticeable difference in energy but tyrosine is what finally pushed me over the edge into wanting to exercise. If you want to experiment with it I would suggest playing with the dose before giving up on it. If it is going to help you, you should be able to notice its effects within a few days. Personally I use 1.5g in the morning on an empty stomach. It is important to take it on an empty stomach not only for competition of absorption with other amino acids, but also because tyrosine competes with other amino acids to cross the blood brain barrier. It is kind of nuanced but look up Tryptophan/LNAA ratio if you want to learn more. My ratio was strongly in favor of tryptophan which is probably why I had so many weird neurological symptoms.\n\nI tried CoQ10 as well but did not notice anything from it even though I tested low on the test I did. Not sure why it did not help.\n\nAs for high dose B vitamins - I had a similar experience as you. They do *something* but end up making me unbalanced in the end. If you have MTHFR issues I would recommend looking into creatine instead of playing around with high dose methylfolate. I have learned through trial and error that it is better to spare methyl groups than to take more, and that is what creatine does. ( is the best resource I have come across when it comes to MTHFR. It really does a good job of summarizing everything and explaining why taking large doses of methylfolate will not work well, check it out if that interests you.  I meant to say paleo. I corrected it. I wanted to like tyrosine and it worked well at first but then I started to get fatigue and shortness of breath from it even at low doses like 400 mg. (I am not the only one.) I definitely have a problem with low dopamine. I will give phenylalanine a try.\nI am generally prone to get shortness of breath and dizziness. It seems to be caused by my blood pressure dropping. It can happen even after drinking tea, especially green tea. Recently I have been taking more salt and it seems to have been helpful.\n\nI have started taking taurine too. Hmm, maybe I just have an unusual physiology because unlike the study I linked earlier my phenylalanine was on the high side:  (I was not supplementing phenylalanine or tyrosine when I did this test, though I had been taking taurine for several months and stopped about a week before.)\n\nThe shortness of breath and dizziness are symptoms I get when I eat a lot of fat; I have not had an issue with those since lowering fat intake. I know it is not caused by blood pressure in my case since I have tested it, it just feels like poor circulation.\n\nThe low fat diet did not fix all my issues unfortunately. After those symptoms went away, I was still dealing with neurological problems, muscle pain, chronic fatigue, and digestive issues. That is where the supplements helped. I am juggling a few other genetic issues in addition to Thal minor though so I do not know how much they will apply to you. The additional genetic issues I know of are G6PD deficiency (&lt;10% function of wildtype) and compound heterozygous MTHFR (about 50% function of wildtype). I have muscle pain too and have no idea what causes it. Maybe inflammation? \nMay be a good idea to have your cortisol levels checked (using the salivary test). Mine were very suboptimal and I started taking adrenal cortex. \n\nI have mental fog and dizziness too and it seems it has a dietary source. I will skimp on fats to see if that would make a difference.    ", "rant: i took high dose iron pills for a almost a yr i have beta thalassemia minor and i also have anemia. for the longest time i thought my stubborn anemia was due to my heavy periods, so i always took prenatal pills or smthin like that. i had no idea there was a connection btwn beta thalassemia minor &amp; iron. last yr, my dr prescribed me 500mg iron pill to take once daily and i did so for a really long time (almost a year). during this time, i had really random &amp; bad symptoms- hormonal imbalance, acne, anxiety, fatigue, and they found a small adrenal mass in a ct scan. i was on no other medication and so i was really confused why this happened out of nowhere (does not run in my family). i recently switched doctors and she told me to stop bc thalassemia limits ferritin/iron levels from going up a certain level &amp; can actually cause bad symptoms. ik these are not the regular symptoms of iron overdose for thalassemia, but i just thought it was rlly strange. most importantly, im just really upset that my old doctor prescribed such high dose iron for so long even tho i have thalassemia. even after my iron levels stayed the same after taking it for 5 months, instead of reevaluating, she told me to take it twice a day. i wish i knew better and was educated on how thalassemia reacts to high iron, but i trusted my ex-dr and wish she first looked at my health conditions before making any decision. sorry for this rant i just felt rlly frustrated bc all of my symptoms and im not sure if im overreacting or should send kaiser a complaint\n\nbtw since ive stopped my iron pills, my symptoms have significantly decreased. hi, yes, a thalassemia minor can look like anemia if a doctor doesnt think too hard about it  (they need to look at the SIZE of your red blood cells to tell). i was also misdiagnosed and given iron and it just poisoned me, since we cant actually USE the excess iron. eventually someone was able to actually look at my blood results critically and say, wait, this is a thalassemia, and took me off the iron. sadly, doctors can kind of be biased where they think its something common and do not look critically, especially if they are too busy sorry to hear that! so does that mean ppl with thalassemia minor are automatically always anemic? also, my new dr recommended that i take low-dose iron pills only when im on my period since there is a lot of blood loss and i was wondering if u had any thoughts on that? thanks! I have been taking them since I was 14 because my doctor prescribed it after diagnosing me with beta thal. I only  stopped this year after finding this community . :') This happened to me recently! Since I moved, I had a new hematologist doctor tell me to take iron pills before he would give me a referral for my gallbladder surgery. I knew iron pills would not help as I was prescribed them when I was a child. Also, all the other hematologists and my research told me iron would not help. But for some reason I figured maaaaybe my body is \u201cchanging\u201d as I am getting older and now I need iron. \n\nWell fast forward to today and it finally dawned on me that the iron supplements have been making me physically and mentally exhausted and irritable. I have been fatigued for weeks. I thought it was my cycle that wore me out, but when it went on for almost 2 weeks after the day of my last period\u2026I knew it was something else. Needless to say, I will not see that doctor again as he is not well versed in thalassemia. I have an appointment with a new doctor in October. \n\nI cannot believe you suffered for over a year! I am so happy you have a new doctor. And yes, you should complain. I would detail all of your symptoms that you endured AND mention how your symptoms did not improve after the 5 month mark. DM if you need help crafting a complaint letter. She needs to be called out and hopefully she does not make the same mistake.\n\nMoral of the story: I do not need iron and switch to a health care provider that understands our condition.\n\nEdit: my anxiety shot through the roof, too! Can you tell me more about the size? My RDW is 23.6%. im not a doctor, but a i understand it, the mcv and mch are low in a thalassemia - that means our red blood cells are smaller, so they literally cant hold the iron we are taking in, so taking too much overloads us instead. for me, im pretty much always anemic but theres not much i can do about it i havent heard of taking iron pills for periods since im on continuos birth control, so i wouldnt know about it. im pretty much always anemic due to this condition. some people have no symptoms, others do, apparently. our red blood cells are smaller so we literallly cant grab and hold the iron very good. i actually have multiple more noticeable chronic conditions, so i cant clearly tell if the thalassemia is causing symptoms. new doctors get concerned about my blood results, then i tell them its a thalassemia and they go, oh ok and that is about it, lol thank you!!\n\nmy fatigue was (and is) so bad! but i thought that it was bc of my anemia so i took even more iron:( def learned my lesson\n\nbut does that mean we should not take any iron at all? i was thinking of just taking a low-dose only during my period, but im still learning abt thalassemia minor so im not sure literally same :') The RDW is the size distribution and you are smart to key in on that. 23% is high which means you have some kind of problem unknown. Beta Thal is less likely because that tends to have consistently small cells.\n\nPair that with your MCV if yours in low (&lt;80) then you have a microcytic anemia, again could be a few things, most common is iron def, but in beta thalassemia the MCV will be teenier like in the 50\u2019s where iron deficiency is in the 60\u2019s/70\u2019s, there are still a few other things it could be. \n\nPair those with your RBC count, in a \u201cdo not have enough stuff to make it\u201d problem, lead poisoning, broken enzymes, chronic disease/inflammation, iron deficiency etc, this will be extra low. In beta thal the RBC count will be high. Cause you are making lots of tiny rbc\u2019s. \n\nSo because all these things can vary between person to person and day to day it is hard to diagnose one from the other with certainty so they made an equation RDW1 which is (MCVxRDW)/RBC. \n\nWith beta thal being (xtrasmallerxnormal)/bigger) = smaller. And iron deficiency (smallerxnormal)/smaller= normalish/variable I am not a medial doctor. I changed my comment to say \u201cI do not need iron...\u201d But for me, I had a negative reaction to extra iron that was in my multivitamin 18mg (ferrous fumarate) AND iron supplement 26mg (fermented iron bisglycinate). For me, the extra iron was not worth the fatigue. However, I did not make it to my next appointment to see if it improved my levels but \u201cif\u201d my levels improved my quality of life decreased. Yeah, I am sorry about that too, doctors make that mistake regularly which is honestly a bit confusing given how relatively common thalassemia is.\n\nIt looks like you made it through your ordeal without major and acute issues which is good.  Eventually you may want to check to see if you have developed hepatic iron overload, though honestly there is no real treatment for that so i do not know if it will do any good... Just got blood test results and my mcv &amp; mch are low and I have thalassemia. Do not know which type or anything else other than having it. My doctor does not seem too concerned I guess it is not a big deal \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "thalassemia hey guys ... \n\nwhy in barts disease there is Y4 and not beta4 like in HBh disease? \n\nbeta 4 forms due to excess beta globin in addition tp alpha globin deficiency so beta globin binds together forming abnormal B4 hemoglobin (HBh).", "Are these test results indicative of thalassemia?  I have recently gone all in on researching how to cure my constant fatigue. I got my blood test results back yesterday and did some research and ended up here. Wanted to know if anyone could weigh in on how the results look and how to proceed! Most likely not - your hemoglobin and MCV levels are quite high for thalassemia. For context, my hemoglobin hovers around 7-8 No. I would wager not. You have too many numbers within or close to acceptable range.   \n\n\nHemoglobin is normal. Hematocrit is not low, which does not indicate destruction of RBC - as typical. MCV is about normal (this would typically be low).  In my laymen opinion. I strongly do not believe you have thalassemia or anything in that category. I am but a simpleton. But, nothing in your CBC shouts = this is what it is! Good luck in finding your ailment. Well I have it and mine are not that different:\n\n* rbc: 6.53\n* mvc: 61\n* hemoglobin: 12.6\n* hematocrit: 40.1% Woah, that is pretty interesting. I am happy that your numbers are in a good range. Do you have thal minor or major if you do not mind me asking? And alpha or beta? Beta thalassemia minor. Q39X variant to be precise, according to my genetic test. They ( I have beta thalassemia minor. I do not have constant fatigue but I do have this weird very low energy feel for no reason sometimes. It got a lot better after I started doing sports. Supplements help a bit also, especially when combined with sports. Update: My doctor ordered an additional blood test for additional testing. They have confirmed that I have alpha thalassemia. From hemoglobin results, my HGB A2 is lower than normal range at 1.6%. Not sure if I have a mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic variant. Yeah you got your results in a good range \nI want to ask how you feel when you at gym or endurance sports and if that disorder will affect quality of life ? My quality of life has improved significantly since I started doing sports. That latent fatigue that you associate with thalassemia just disappeared.\n\nI feel fine at the gym or running, not better or worse than most of the other people. I would say the only hard part was getting started, because I got to a point were I was really becoming quite sedentary. I was also a smoker and when you start working out at that level of fitness you are in for a world of hurt during the first weeks and months, every muscle hurts and your lungs cry in agony every run. \n\nBut it starts getting better quickly, each time you run you go a little faster and further, every week you lift a little more weight and your muscles start getting bigger. That really kept me motivated. If you do something more competitive like crossfit even more so. Yeaah i see i hope you will continue in that is way i have the same results of blood count like yours and i feel the same way when i do gym and exercise and when im in sedentary i also smoke not so much but like an average .\nWell i want to ask you about who is you mental health do you suffer from some illness like depression anxiety  mood swings...", "Cost of thalassemia reflex panels Was recently diagnosed with anemia and my doctor wants me to get a thalassemia panel done. Problem is I am currently not insured. \n\nDoes anyone know what the cost of such a lab without insurance could come out to be?\n\nSince my internship employer does not provide insurance i am not going to be on a good plan anytime soon, so might have to pay out of pocket. It sucks this is not part of basic healthcare", "Lack of energy Does anyone have any tips for getting aome energy with beta thalassemia minor? Proper sleep, diet, and exercise are not enough without caffiene, and that causes terrible anxiety:/ Have you tried half caf? I drink a single cup of that in the morning. Anything stronger gives me the anxiety I had to see a master herbalist for my fatigue. I feel much better now, but every now and then I just get too tired to do anything. Mostly during my time of the month. Folic acid and a bunch of vitamin supplements (I use a multivitamin, Calcium+D, Vit C, and Fish oil). Having enough vitamins and minerals will let you replace your red cells quickly. Make sure to get enough iron through your diet, not through supplements (green leafy veg is good!).\n\nOther than that, light to moderate exercise. Do not over-exert yourself, but getting some mild exercise like regular walks or weight lifting will increase your tolerance for activity. do you have any names of the herbs? i would not use anything not already in my tea box because I am definitely not a professional but I am down to try anything safe Alright, thank you so much. folic acid did not really help, but the mulivitamin might. lots of green veggies and exercise arent cutting it :/ hmm maybe sipping on green tea throughout the day would provide a small but steady boost? i didnt think about that til now lol As of now I take:\n\n5,000 ius of Vitamin D,\n2 capsules of Energizing Iron by Natures\u2019s Way,\n1-2 capsules of Adrenaplex by Terry Naturally,\n3 capsules PB8 Probiotics,\n1 gel capsule of Vitamin E by Solgar,\n\nI also drink red raspberry tea almost every day to help with my cramps. And I know the iron supplement I take is fine because I get my iron levels checked every 6 months and it has improved a little. It was low before. It is actually more of a vitamin B12 supplement if you read the label. \n\nI have quit caffeine altogether because I had really bad side effects with it. I have become addicted to wheatgrass juice :/ it gives me tons of energy! Nobody else in my family will drink it because they think it tastes bad but my toddler likes it. Both he and I have had an increase in hemoglobin since drinking it so I know it is actually doing something. \n\nProbably cannot hurt and might help. Good luck, some days are better than others are not they Second that. I also take vitamin D 2500-5000 daily but dont overdo it. taking too much causes anxiety and insomnia for me.\n\nAlso 500-1000mg of calcium ascorbate helps alot with energy. I feel your pain, \ud83d\ude1e my energy levels are so low. and my blood \ud83e\ude78 lacks vitamin D. I get tired so quickly. No stamina Ive never heard of it, but its worth a shot! I have read studies about how it increases fetal hemoglobin production, so that makes total sense! Have you gotten all your vitamin levels checked? Might help you pinpoint if you are missing anything nutritionally.", "Does thalassemia can be cured via gene editing? Recently, I found that there is a news from china. The thalassemia has been cured by gene editing. Yeah, CRISPR gene editing will be able to cure a lot of conditions- like cystic fibrosis and thalassemia once it gets perfected. It is really cool science. But it is expensive. Besides, I do not know is it able to cure thalassemia alpha Does that apply only for children or would it be still curable if you are an adult? They have done it on Sickle Cell disease with positive outcome. Very exciting news for us. I am so tired of being tired all the time. I have thalassemia beta. I hope it can help me feel good. I have such low enthusiasm, energy, and fatigue. It sucks so much. \ud83d\ude22 I am minor of the thalassemia. Sometimes, I feel tired and faint/dizzy. But I do not know is it expensive when it launch. I hear you. Maybe it is depression Every body need to know how gene editing are done it is not a simple its require chemotherapy after and many things to done the procedure. \n\nAnd its recommend for beta thalassemia major .\n\nI hope they will develop for every one with genetic disorders and to put the functional gene in it is right place. It is not. I have thalassemia and sickle cell trait. Please do not get it mixed up with depression. Okay I hope the best for everyone suffering. Of course, I hope that it can be cured all of the genetic disorder and it can be affordable for everyone. Yeah you feel stigmatised with a genetic disorder but no one is perfect . Same here.. So tired..even sleeping does not give new energy.. Did you feel like this from a specific age? I think I felt like this from 18YO.. Actually, I feel that when I am young (7 years old).

Oh yeah I forgot, have a good life.", "Finally got those blood results back after my hospital gave me the run around. They now deny me even having a blood disorder since the electrosentesis came back normal. Well I am pregnant and never had a normal electro in my life till now. At least it gives me a hint of my baby most likely not having it! \n\nThe problem is before I was pregnant it was confirmed I had a blood disorder. I now have to fight the hospital to do another test at the chromosomal level after birth to at least get my own results. How far along are you? I am just about to cross over into my second trimester and have a Dr. appointment tomorrow. \n\nI think I remember reading somewhere the body produces fetal hemoglobin during pregnancy. And it can cross over to the mother. Not 100 percent on that though. I will be 15 weeks on friday but the blood was drawn when I was 12 weeks. And it is true mom and baby share hemoglobin and other things. That is why triple and quad screens exist, they look for fetal abnormalities through mom's blood. It is also why I figured my electrophoresis came back normal for the first time in my life lol. I am 31 weeks and my OB had me on high doses of iron since I was 12 weeks because my hemoglobin levels were low. I kept telling them I was a non-iron deficient anemic because of thalassemia. \nI got to to point where I would throw up almost immediately after taking the iron, and they still wanted to increase my dose.\n\nAbout 2 months ago I had enough and requested to be seen by a hematologist, who tested my iron and iron storages, and told me I only need to be taking the prenatal.\n\nMoral of the story, if the doctors are not recognizing the blood disorder you know you have, talk to a hematologist. Thank you I can see if I can request to see one but of course military doctors are stingy and arrogant around where I live and they do not like to admit they cannot help me lol. I am going to ask any way and hopefully get some answers about if I can or not!", "Hemoglobin from 11.5 to 13.5-14 - Thal minor Hi , I am thalassemia minor . Has anyone thal minor ever got his hemoglobin from 11.5 to 13.5 to 14 ?? \nI would like someone to talk from his personal experience . Thank you very much for your answers . My hemoglobin has always been around 7-8. Never reach above 8. So I will not know how a 14 would feel like. I do not know if you will understand me or not because as I am working in healthcare I am aware about what I will talk about. so I will tell you about my experience : \n\nMy hemoglobin level are in general 12 it is been 3 years ago that I have been diagnosed with beta thalassemia minor the reason behind that is that I was told I have normal CBC from doctor and that did not convince me so I was wondering why I am not like other people I mean why my hemoglobin levels are not range between (14 -17 ) (normal range) and that took me to a hematologist once he saw the CBC he gave me another blood check (ferritin) it is in normal ranges after that another blood check again (hemoglobin electrophoresis) that is came with the diagnosis of beta thalassemia trait . So that completely changed my life from that time I remember every fatigue or lightheaded o feeling tired and related it to that and from that time I start searching about that until now and find out that there is no treatment for it as the hematologist told me too . \n\nIn my efforts to trying to rise my hemoglobin despite the genetic disorder I was in  a good diet and different supplements and exercising including (running bodybuilding) and having a resting time.\nI have raised the level to 13.5 but that did not still too much time as I return to sedentary lifestyle again and smoking cigarettes (which is very bad for people with that condition) \n\nNow I will told you about the mechanisms of raising hemoglobin levels in such a condition and to understand well this condition : \n\nyou should imagine you blood like you have a bowl of ball : \n\nTo fill all the bowl with balls of 2 cm in diameter we need 100 balls . That is how it is In normal .\n\nSo in thalassemia minor we cannot have balls with 2 cm in diameter like normal people but we have the same bowl so we got balls with 1.5 cm in diameter so to compensate the same volume that is 2 cm balls fill it  we need more quantity of 1.5 cm balls for example (for 20 balls of 2 cm we need 30 of 1.5 cm to fill the same volume )and we can not have this big quantity of balls to fill the same volume so we fill just 80 to 90 % of it .\n\nI hope you will understand my description. 2 cm is 0.79 inches Yes it is anyway that just an example 1. Thanks for the answer . You used nice example to explain the situation \n\n\n2. Male or female ?\n\n\n3 . Tell me please all the supplements you used , dosage and frequency 1.It is okay \n\n2. Male \n\n3. For me I recommend \n\nVitamin E \n(Several clinical trials have indicated that vitamin E might be used therapeutically as a potential erythropoietic agent for decreasing the premature erythrocyte hemolysis by reducing the fragility of erythrocytes. By this way, it improves the post-supplemental blood hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in some of the anemic human subjects.)\n\n\nL- Carnitine + folates 1 mg no more than 1 because its can affects levels of vitamin B12 making it drop.\n\nTaurine. \n\nL-tyrosin. \n\nMelatonin. \n\nMultivitamin (vitamin D and omega 3 included) \n\nSmall amounts of fenugreek mixed with honey to improve intestinal absorption. \n\nReduce sugar intake to eat 4 meals in a day. \n\nIf you feel dizzy or lightheaded (Crataegus)\nIn herbal medicine. There supplement of it .\n\nNB : always respect doses. And talk with with your doctor if you feel something unusual. \n\nRemember that your hemoglobin raising relative with your red blood cells. And that is all . I which that can help you and others also because that take off me several years of searching nights and days to understand well this condition and I am still experimenting and searching about other new things that can help me and others as well . And that is all . Thank you very much for your answers .\n\nI ve tried everything of the supplements you mentioned except for Vitamin E .\n\nSo , does Vitamin E act as an erythropoietin secreting supplement ??\n\nI read an ncbi study and looks promising .\n\nAlso did you feel a lot of difference in everyday life , tiredness and fitness endurance at Hemoglobin 13.5 compared to 12.0 ????\n\nWish you the best Acttually the action of vitamine E is antioxydant preserve the maximum life for red blood cells with that the premature destruction or dead of cells decreases. \n\nActtually there is not much difference between 12 or 13.5 for thalassemia persons because they are used to live with that amount of hemoglobin and also some studies shows that thalassemia patients can handle severe anemia. Anyway it just what are you used too and you need to train your body to be resistant in different situations. Did not you feel less dyspnea while running, swimming , climbing stairs etc ???\n\nDid not you feel less tired at afternoons after morning work ?? I did not notice any real changes, the only thing is when you are used to exercise you feel less dyspnea. I have tried, but very rarely get above 13", "Yellow skin and eyes?? Anything I can do  If its not normal for you then go to a doctor, that usually indicates liver problems. You are getting too much iron, you are experiencing liver damage. See your doctor This is jaundice, it indicates an increased bilirubin due to liver dysfunction, increased rate of red blood cell destruction, hepatitis, or gallstones. This is definitely something to check in with your doctor about, especially if this is abnormal for you. It is important to determine the underlying cause as treatment is dependent on it. Went to doctors before for this that is when I found out bout beta thal , but the weird thing is I am COMPLETELY healthy (thankgod) , normal liver and everything Weird, maybe its just an odd side effect you yourself have. The thing is my liver and everything is completely healthy , that is what is confusing I have increased billrubin, but my liver and everything is healthy, 4 years ago I started to notice yellow How about some sunlight ?  Like how they put the babies under lights when they are a little jaundiced ? To correct all previous answers, yes it is completely normal if you have Thalassemia.\n\nBecause your red blood cells live only 10-30 days (Thal Minor) compared to healthy people (90-120 days), your bilirubin levels get elevated because bilirubin is a degradation product of Hemoglobine. Hemoglobine is found in your red blood cells.\n\nYou will also have a slightly enlarged spleen because red blood cells are broken down there.\n\nI have Beta Thalassemia Minor and my bilirubin levels fluctuate between 1-2 and my eyes/skin are always yellowish. If your eyes are yellow, your liver is not \"completely healthy' Yes it is Naw it can though, just because my red blood cells die quick, has no relation to liver, if it did I think I would know by now with, over the years of drinking, getting multiple blood tests. Or unless I got a liver like frank gallager I live with thal major so I have pretty severe liver damage from iron overload, sounds like what you are dealing with. Re-access for a minute: you are on the internet asking for medical advice, so you know you do not know it all - cannot hurt to see your doctor for bloodwork in regards to what can lead to extensive damage. Why take such a big risk based on \"nah bro trust me my liver is healthy\"?  As someone who did not care for myself like I should have in my teens and early twenties and didnt have parents who gave a shit, I am now paying the consequences at 26. See my profile for last night's numbers. Thal major is much more severe, yeah, but just take my word for it that it is worth the trouble to avoid complications. \nSource: typing this from a hospital bed with IVs in both arms took a long fucking time I did get blood work done for it mutilple times thorough the years, got blood work done 2 months ago (not for this) too.

But after some days it got frequent. And when it happened my hands and legs get cold. Those palpitations really scared me like someday my heart going to stop. \n\nSo the doctor sent me from a Heart specialist, Hematologist to Psychiatry. I remember one doctor said that I am mentally ill and told my parents to take me home one asked me if I do drug abuse.  Those days were really the bad ones. It took a lot of time for them to understand what was the real matter and It took them like 2 months to find out that I have Beta thalassemia minor. And between these 2 months, they gave me a drug which is given to depressed people, monitored my heart, gave Iron tabs, a lot of medicines and, vitamin injections. But at last one doctor, he was a good one, checked all my files, samples, tests and said to stop taking medicines given by other doctors. He only prescribed one medicine, **FOL 3( methylcobalamin, folic acid and pyridoxine hydrochloride)**. And said to match blood tests when you marry someone in future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. So is it possible that thalassemia gets prominent after some situations like a disease?\n\n2. Do you guys take Vitamin supplements? I really feel tired some times like real tired\n\n3. And I am really skinny. I am 21, I have completed my school, completed my diploma, now doing Bachelors. But I still look like I am a school kid. I do not gain weight whatever I do. And it makes me feel bad like my friend look like they are in college but then I am in front of them and I look like a kid. So are all thalassemia people skinny or is it just me?\n\n3. And are the Vaccines safe? \n\nYou all people know the situation India is going through right now. People are dying because of a lack of Oxygen. But I feel like it was people fault too. I saw people without masks and a lot of festivals without any precautions, political rallies, Kumbh Mela and a lot of other things.\n\nAfter 1 May people above 18 will be able to take their vaccine shots. So are they safe? \n\n4. Any tips that will help me feel like I am healthy? \n\n5. Any other things that I should keep in mind? I do not have all the answers here, hopefully others can help as well.  Generally Beta Thal is not really a big deal and I would recommend not focusing on it too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I know that thalassemia symptoms do change with your age\n\n\\-We are safe to take vaccines, no worries there\n\n\\-Those heart issues freaked me out too, i found myself checking my pulse sometimes to make sure i was not dying\n\n\\-I do not take supplements and for the most part it has no impact on my life aside from decreased stamina when exercising\n\n\\-yeah, i was skinny and small at your age as well, but that may be a coincidence.  it does not matter though, just be who you are in life. Sorry to hear it hit you so hard all of a sudden. My wife has beta thalassemia minor and it started affecting her in her mid teens, prior to that she was physically active and did not tire out as easily. She is always had an issue with air quality though, being in a restaurant for too long would give her brain fog and she would need to step outside for fresh air.\n\nHer symptoms are a lot better these days, and we believe it is largely due to taking Vitamin B. There are a ton of different vitamin B supplements out there so do your research before you purchase one. The one she takes is a dual action vitamin B that releases over 8 hours, and contains folic acid as well.\n\nMy wife is pretty skinny too, and has trouble putting on weight similar to you. Though that could be more genetics than the thalassemia since her brother is also skinny and has trouble gaining weight though he does not have beta thalassemia.\n\nWe are both registered to take the vaccine. I do not believe there is any research showing there may be additional concerns for people taking the Pfizer and moderna vaccines with thalassemia, but I doubt there is been an adequate amount of testing done yet.\n\nI hope you continue to stay active! Not only is it good for your body physically, it will help you out mentally as well. Especially now that exercise is harder on your body, you have to be more intentional about exercise.\n\nAll the best! You have some great questions and I hope I can help with some of them!\n\nFirst: are you male or female? This only matters because of menstruation, which can sometimes cause lower iron levels in women, despite what you may have heard about iron and thal minors. I have beta thal minor like you, but because of my heavy periods, my iron levels are crazy low right now and I am getting iron infusions next week!\n\nAnd regardless if you are male or female - have you had your iron levels checked? Beta thal minor alone will only have minor symptoms, but if you have another deficiency leading to anemia, that might be what is been hitting you so hard in the last few years. Other things to check that can cause anemia: folate levels, B12 levels, and Vitamin D levels. Get those checked out to see if you have any deficiencies there.\n\nAlso, I am sorry to hear about your experiences with the medical system in India and I can only imagine things are very very bad right now. Anemia is a pain in the ass, but your first priority should be staying as safe as possible during this Covid outbreak. \n\nTo answer some of your questions:\n\n1) Thal minor alone is probably not the biggest issue. As I mentioned, getting your vitamin/mineral levels checked might point to other issues causing anemia.\n\n2) There are not any specific vitamins to take for beta thal minor. You might hear warnings against taking iron, but if you are iron deficient, then it is safe to take iron until your levels are okay again. \n\n3) Weight is unrelated to beta thal minor. I have been obese, thin, and everything between. I have thal minor family who are overweight, and some who are skinny and cannot seem to gain weight. Thal minor does not affect your metabolism or appetite.\n\n4) Vaccines are safe. I have had the Pfizer vaccine and no symptoms (except for a sore arm). Covid is much more dangerous.\n\n--Tips to feel healthy: for now, focus on wearing a mask and isolating as much as you can to avoid Covid (and getting vaccinated as soon as you can). Once it is safe again, try to get your concerns with anemia and weakness addressed. Beta thal minor alone is probably not causing your sudden weakness or lack of appetite/inability to gain weight, so if you can find out what is, that will get you started in the right direction.\n\n--Other things to keep in mind: stupid iron. Despite everything I said above, it *is* possible to overload on iron. Some beta thal minors, especially men bc they do not bleed monthly, have a tendency to over-absorb iron in the gut and can overload on iron. So you may have low iron, you may have high iron, or you may have good iron levels. The only way to know for sure is a blood test, and until then, avoid iron supplements. Do not worry too much about iron in your diet for now and do not let it weigh on your mind until you can verify your iron levels. But just know that you will sometimes hear warnings against iron supplementation for thal minors because some *do* over-absorb iron. Not all though (like me).\n\nBest of luck and you are welcome to message if you have more questions! Has your wife had her iron levels checked? It is possible - and quite common - for women especially with beta thal minor to have iron deficiency that causes anemia!\n\nDo you know if her periods are especially heavy? It is usually suspect #1 for iron deficiency in women. \n\nThe Vit B + folic acid are a good move. Vitamin D is another one to consider since low levels can also cause anemia. She checks her iron level regularly, almost once a month. She used to take iron supplements a while back, but stopped at our doctor\u2019s recommendation since it is apparently common for people with beta thalassemia to get iron poisoning due to the body not being able to keep up with processing the iron.\n\nShe got an iron infusion once when she was in her second trimester and which really helped, though the effect did not stick around obviously. Thanks for answers\ud83d\ude42 Yeah, I do exercise but not that intense like the way I used to do. But now I love long walks so much. Before this covid thing, I was solo travelling and I used to walk like 10-15Km per day. I just love that. And yeah I used to spend a lot of hours riverside reading books and flying drone. Just want this covid to get over cause I miss travelling, friends and a lot of things. \n\nThanks for giving answers. Stay safe.\ud83d\ude42 I am male. No, I have not got checked my iron levels for the past few months. Ok, I will keep this iron absorption thing In my mind. Thanks for all the answers. Stay safe\ud83d\ude42 Interesting! I have heard so many conflicting things about iron and thal minor. Obviously, when iron is low it has to be infused/supplemented as I am learning, but this goes against what I have always been told - to avoid iron. I did such a good job that my levels are absurdly low now. \n\nStudies are pretty scarce and I am seeing some that say iron is recommended when it is low, but that thal minors tend to over-absorb iron in the gastrointestinal tract to make up for the poor RBC counts. \n\nI am glad to hear that the infusions worked for her when she needed it. I am hoping for the same! Hm. My heart beats real fast like that sometimes but I always attributed it to the fact I drink way more caffeine than one person should (Which I guess thal ppl should not drink much too but like lol I am not going to stop..)  \n\n\n1. Yeah probably. Mine has gotten more noticeable as I get older especially the feelings of being weak/tired\n2. I do. I take a pre-natal vitamin (Not getting pregnant but I heard it is kind of normal for women to do so anyway b/c it is goood for skin and nails and I wanted a high dose of the folic acid in it), magnesium citrate (for constipation issues), and I started taking a B12 yesterday per another user's suggestion. I noticed a big difference in my energy today with it but I do not know if that is just placebo effect. Occasionally steal one of my bf's fishoil (good for joints) since we at that age (30). \n3. Cannot relate. I am 5'1 so I did not get very tall (My mom's 5'2, dad was \"on the short side\" according to my gargantuan aunt, and all of the boys in my family are tall so I dunno where to attribute the height to) but I am predisposed to gaining and keeping weight on from my dad's genes (affected half-sister on dad side too). \n4. Covid vaccines are safe. The J&amp;J one that caused blood clots in women does not have enough info on it but things like birth control can cause blood cloths too, along with having just given a birth and other crap so not enough info on those factors. The other two should be safe. I had a coworker today whos dad just had to go to the hospital for a massive drop in his iron (needs an iron infusion) but I do not know if that is related to the vaccine or just a coincidence with older age since I have not heard of any one else having this type of issue. As with anything, talk to your doctor\n5. Tips for feeling healthy: Eat healthy, work out, experiment with vitamins to see if a combo helps you (involve your doctor, if you have insurance you can just flat out get a test to see if you have any deficiencies, discuss any supplements that interest you otherwise). I do not have insurance and cannot afford to have it so I just kind of wing it lol\n6. Other things to keep in mind: People are always going to be fuckin confused by what thal is, it is hard to explain to people, and people always look at me like I am making it up when I talk about it and the symptoms I experience. Just do your best in life that is all anyone should expect from anyone.", "Does thalassemia cause delayed growth in men? I have beta thalassemia minor.

I have seen many examples of that before . I do not get asked if I am high but i do have basically no energy all of the time even with crazy amounts of caffeine. I have noticed as I have gotten older it is been harder to focus and concentrate. I thought it was undiagnosed ADHD but now I am wondering (When I was diagnosed with thal minor as a teen my doctor never talked to me about it at all and I only got told by my mom \"This is what you have, take these supplements\" which I found out today at almost 30 years old was actually probably the wrong move by my doctor, which does not surprise me considering other issues with him but I digress) Thank you so much. People simply do not understand the lack of energy that comes with sickle cell trait and thalassemia. It never even occurred to me they were linked (you can see from my other posts here I wasnt really informed well on what thal minor was) but I have been discriminated against at jobs for not being able to perk up. It is some shit. EXACTLY, people do not know or care wtf ppl got going on in their lives. My stamina is literally cut in half and it sucks. No one can really sympathize with me unless they know what it is like.", "Thalassemia beta Could someone give me information on the beta form? My blood test is consistent with the beta form. How the beta form works is that there is two genes. Two  normal beta genes are normal and expected. Those help you produce enough hemoglobin. It is commonly thought of as recessive even though it is actually co-dominant. The dead gene has an effect on the hemoglobin produced even when the normal gene produces enough.\n\nThalassemia minor: If you have one normal gene and one dead gene or one that produces way less beta globin than usual, you still make enough hemoglobin, but to compensate, the body makes more red blood cells to usual to reach the normal hemoglobin level. You might have slight synptoms such as fatigue and pale skin. You might not reach a hemoglobin level that is as high as compared to a normal person, but you make enough so that you can thrive easily and have little problems.\n\nIntermediate thalassemia: If one of your genes are dead and the other one still produces some beta globin (but not as much as a normal gene), you do not need transfusions due to the hemoglobin level still being relatively high (around 7-9g/dl at best) and you can still thrive although you will have symptoms such as tiredness. In some severe cases though, you need blood transfusions every few weeks to survive. You do not usually get offered a bone marrow transplant because the risks can outweigh the benefits.\n\nSevere thalassemia: If both your beta genes are completely dead, you effectively need blood transfusions every few weeks for the rest of your life to survive. You cannot live without them. You will also have to take iron chelators to reduce the amount of iron in your body because transfusions are well known for causing iron overload. Without transfusions, your hemoglobin level is extremely low and you cannot thrive. \n\nCure: You can also get a bone marrow transplant (in severe cases only) to cure this condition completely and be free of transfusions. There are risks associated with this treatment but it works extremely well. The only catch is that you still pass thalassemia genes onto your kids since the transplant does not change your sperm DNA but your blood DNA only. There Well put. It seems like I have minor.\nBut...i styll get symptoms. Anything I can do? My doc said that once my RBC and hemoglobin fell into the compensation / normal range, my fatigue wouldnt be caused by this. But yet im still tired all the time Even though you have minor, you still get mild symptoms or possibly none if you are lucky.  You are going to be below the average range and that is genetic. Symptoms are normal and common for minors. \n\nYou usually only have no symptoms if you have a silent carrier state of thalassemia (if two of your genes are basically fully functional but still produce ever so slightly less globin than usual). Your hemoglobin level is usually normal in that case since enough is already produced and the amount of hemoglobin lost is not enough to make any difference.\n\nTaking a few milligrams of folic acid can help make your body make the most of its blood cells by producing more to raise the hemoglobin slightly.  This may help you feel better.\n\nI cannot recall if you mentioned anything about this, but get your iron checked. If it is low, start iron supplements after checking with your doctor to get  your levels back up. That is also another cause of fatigue. \n\nI am not a thal minor but I do have hemoglobin H disease which is a variant of alpha thal which is similar to the intermediate form. I used to take folic acid every day to help me get to the normal range until I had to move to transfusions every month as a result of not growing..", "I would like opinions/personal experiences if you are able to. Thanks in advance! Hey everybody, great to meet you all. Hope everyone is keeping well! \n\nI think the best place to start is with a brief intro. Around 5 years ago I started getting really light headed dizzy spells (sometimes to the point of almost fainting). I went to see my doctor and  he thought I was Iron deficient and prescribed Iron supplements. Fast forward to a couple weeks later when I got the blood test results... My Iron was a fair bit higher than normal and was told to keep an eye on it and stop taking the supplements. Just as I was walking out of the patient room, my doctor was looking at my chart and said \"wait a minute are you Greek\" (last name is Georgiou). My reply.. Yes my Dad is from Cyprus. He sent me for another blood test and sure enough came back positive for Beta Thalassemia Minor. \n\nI get very random symptoms along the lines of chest pains, shortness of breath, feeling really dizzy/tired, lethargic, strange sensitivity to hot/cold, hands and feet that are like blocks of ice sometimes and a strange \"trembling\" type of feeling randomly. I have been sent for pretty much every other type of test out there to rule out something sinister and thankfully they have come back within normal range so far.\n\nFor the most part I would like to think I can go through life and not have to worry about this but I am not convinced that my doctor really knows what he is talking about when I ask him questions about this.\n\nI have two questions that I would like opinions/personal experiences on:\n\n1. Report does not mention \"minor\" but my doctor assured me it is the \"minor\" version. Do you agree with this statement?\n2.

I am not sure whether this has been caused by deficiencies, ADHD, depression or anxiety.\n\nI recently had a blood test and:\n\nRBC= 6.24 (x10^12/L)  (Range is 4.40-5.80)\n\nMCV= 67.3 (fL) (Range is 80-99)\n\nMCH= 20.2 (pg) (Range is 27-33.50)\n\nMCHC= 300 (g/L) (Range is 320-360)\n\nB12= 532 (pg/mL) (Range is 197-771)\n\nFolate= 4.8 (ng/mL) (Range is 2.90-26.80)\n\n\nWas wondering if these are significant enough to cause any noticeable symptoms? Are there any supplements I should be taking? Thank you.", "Could my appendicitis have been a result of iron overload? My parents told me that I was jaundice as a baby and that they did blood tests and found that I was a carrier of the thalassemia gene. They told me that it was recessive and that the only time it would be a problem was if I chose to have kids with someone else who held the gene. I never thought much about it. \n \nSo I got a blood test recently and my doctor told me that I am anemic. My mom told me \u201coh maybe it is your thalassemia gene, you should mention that to your doctor.\u201d So I had a bit of cognitive dissonance here\u2014if my gene is recessive, and I do not actually \u201chave\u201d thalassemia, then why is it making me anemic? \n\nI started researching the symptoms and it was like the puzzle pieces of my life all came together.\n\n1. Anemia - I have felt fatigued throughout my life. I often tried to ignore it and felt like I was running away from \u201claziness.\u201d\n\n2. Pale skin - I specifically remember my dad always asking me why I was so pale at times. One time I thought \u201cWhy AM I so pale right now? I just spent the past week in the sun....this does not make sense.\u201d\n\n3. Bone deformities - My left rib protrudes out way further than my right rib. I also have mild pectus excavatum. \n\n4. Developmental stunting - It surely took me way longer to go through puberty than all of my peers. I looked/sounded way younger than all the other boys for most of high school. \n\n5. Irregular heartbeat - I have perceived my heart pounding strangely from time to time. I have typically ignored this.  \n\nAnyways I am 30 now and I am piecing together so many life occurrences in the context of thalassemia. \n\nWhen I was 27 I had my appendix removed. Of course, I was never offered an explanation by the doctors, besides that sort of infection just happens sometimes. \n\nBut I remember exactly what led up to the pain that led to my appendectomy. My friend had acquired a tremendous amount of expensive steaks and threw a barbecue. We gorged ourselves on red meat. I always in the back of my mind supposed I had sabotaged my organ due to the high amount of saturated fat I consumed that day. But now I am thinking that I burdened my system with too much iron. And now that I think of it, I feel like my heart acts noticably strange every time I eat a large amount of steak (which I have always assumed was due to the saturated fat as well).  \n\nAnyone else ever notice anything like this? What do you think of my theory? Should I let go of red meat (I do not eat it often, but I also never shy away from it if it is present)? I have read that supplementing with iron can make people with thal feel poisoned, and that you should try to get iron from actual food. But maybe iron rich meats are just too much for my body to handle?   \n\nThanks for listening I have thalassemia... iron overload can lead to spleen enlargement. What are you ferritin levels? Based on what you described it sounds to me that you probably have beta-thalassemia minor. Being a carrier of the gene in this case means that you have mild symptoms and not the full blown disease. Carriers will usually experience mild to moderate anemia but not require blood transfusions. Meanwhile, those with the full blown disease (beta-thalassemia major), like me, require regular blood transfusions or else they die at a young age. On the bright side, you too are immune to malaria! Let us take a moment to soak in the possibilities of unfettered travel to Africa. \n\nIt looks to me like all five of those symptoms you described are in line with having the thalassemia trait. If you would like some more information on it, I would look at thalassemia.org. They have very good information on the forms of thalassemia and you can get in touch with them if you need resources. In fact, here is a helpful brochure: \n\nIn regards to your appendix bursting, that may just be a terrible coincidence. \n\nAlso, as far as giving up red meat, no I do not believe you need to do that. You most likely do not have iron overload but if you are worried you can ask your doctor to order a ferritin test. People with thalassemia major are the ones that deal with iron overload from constant blood transfusions. You should ask your doctor (or maybe seek out a hematologist) to see if your hemoglobin is so low that you might need a blood transfusion occasionally. One of those would help with many of your symptoms. \n\nI think the one supplement I have heard might be helpful in your case is folic acid. Iron supplementation is not recommended. \n\nLastly, you may also want to look at a cardiologist and have them do an EKG and an echocardiogram to make sure you do not have any heart deformities caused by anemia. \n\nI hope this was helpful! And do not forget the silver lining! No malaria. Ahha! Made me laugh. Needed that. thank you so much for taking the time to spell all of that out for me and provide some resources. Will definitely look into that website and keep all of your advice in mind the next time I speak with my doctor. \u270c\ufe0f", "15year old sister has been diagnosed with thalassemia and I am freaking out Hi everyone, texting on mobile and I just joined the sub.\n\nMy younger sister, she is a twin and she has been diagnosed with it after years of tests and doctors' not finding anything. Her face swells up around the jaw occasionally and then it goes down. \n\nHow do we move forward as a family? We are being raised by a single mother and she is one of 4 girls. I am really worried about the swelling because she is a teenager and there will be insecurities, is there anything I can do to help? Any treatment she can take for this? \n\nPlease note that we live in South Africa, free government health care is inadequate so we use private health care which is very expensive. So I need advice with this in mind, when visiting a private doctor I would like to know which questions to ask and tests to request.\n\nThank you so much for any advice and feedback. I really appreciate it. I think you should ask for ablood check to see if there is anemia and if it is moderate or severe the doctor need to search for cause beside thalassemia minor and about face swelling she is maybe allegic to some food or drugs i do not know i have seen face swelling in allegies they can have some blood check for allergies", "Chronic paleness and fatigue.. I lost hope As the title says I have been very pale for my entire life, I have always complained for it (everyone was always joking for my very white skin) and for the strong fatigue.\nMy parents are both doctors and they know well how much this was and is a problem to me: from what I know I have beta thalassemia, which causes me to have 'lower end' values for most of the blood analysis. They also always told me I cannot do anything for it and that there is no therapy for my form. I have tried everything, from iron to b vitamins, like literally anything to cure this.\nIs this the truth? I mean, my life has been always shitty to me because of the chronic fatigue, weakness and strong paleness... Is there really nothing to do? \n\nHemoglobin: 10,3 (ref values 14-18)\nHematocrit: 35 (42-52)\nMedium corpuscular volume 64,8 (82-94)\nMedium hgb content 19 (27-36)\nMedium hgb concentration 29,5 (32-37)\n\nI also suffer from Hypopituitarism and have a GH deficiency since 5yo, and now I am suspected to be having hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.\nIm 24 but I am not growing, not showing secondary sexual characters and I am afraid my anemia is also a cause.\nThanks to all of you that will take the time to help me I recently found out that I have Beta Thalassemia, Dominant which is also a rare form of Thalassemia. I was always told that I have chronic anemia and I was often pale, sickly, and very thin growing up and I still have problems keeping weight on. I am 5'11 but weigh 125lbs. I have been researching as much as possible about Thalassemia. The iron you are taking may be a big part of you not feeling well, your paleness, and fatigue. People with Thalassemia are prone to iron overload. Iron overload can cause low level hemolysis. Iron is also a trigger for most genetic blood disorders and inherited hemoglonopathies and can cause mild to severe hemolytic anemia depending on the Thalassemia variant you have. Iron chelation therapy and blood transfusions are the typical treatment for Thalassemia but this also depends on the variant you have. Some people are transfusion dependent and some people are asymptomatic. Make sure the B12 you are using do not have contraindicated ingredients in them. I never found B12 helpful. I use folate, liver supplements (used with caution because of the dietary iron), eat beets, and drink beef broth when I am anemic. I also supplement with zinc picolinate. Did you have transfusions? I am constantly pale since I remember going to first years of school. My parents always tell me it is not a symptom of thalassemia but my normal skin colour and I honestly refuse to accept it, it is been an enormous problem for me (without considering the fatigue). Are you still pale? I should get a visit with a specialist. I have had two transfusions so far. Both times was due to severe hemolytic anemia I am not transfusion-dependent and only require transfusions when I get severe anemia. I still have issues sometimes in with paleness, especially when I am fighting off an infection or virus. Any medical book/ article about Thalassemia will tell you that paleness is a common symptom. I have not had any paleness since my last blood transfusion two years ago though. You should have/follow up with a Hemotalogist if you have Thalassemia, genetic blood disorders. I see mine every 3 months. Thanks for your responses. I will get an appointment soon... Ive Always been really pale and always tired.. hopefully maybe they can help me\nHonestly I hope they will tell me I might need transfusions as I do not really accept being so pale Here is more information about the types, symptoms, and treatments for Thalassemia.\n\n Thanks, but honestly I have read quite a lot about it... The fact is this: how do I know if I need treatment (transfusions...) Or not? \nAlso could I ask you your blood exams values?\nI know that similar values do not necessarily mean same therapy, but just to compare because maybe I would need that too My hemotalogist tests my iron serum levels and does a CBC every 3 months. The results for my last test were:\n\nMCV: 76.9 (Low)\nMCH: 25.4 (Low)\nHemoglobin: 12.3 (Normal)\nHemotocrit: 37.3 (Normal)\nIron, Total: 57 (Within Normal range)\nIron Binding Capacity: 253 (Within Normal Range)\n% Saturation: 23 (Within Normal Range) \n\nThe low MCV and MCH are common in Thalassemia. When my hemoglobin drops down to 8 or lower, that is when I require transfusions. \n\nMy iron levels are always normal, which is why iron supplements are more of a problem than it is a benefit. A Hemotalogist will perform a hemoglobin-electrophoresis test to determine the type/variant of Thalassemia you have and create a course of treatment based on that. I dont turn pale but I do turn yellow....I have Gilbert's syndrome not jaundice. I notice when I get closer to needing transfusions (which I have thankfully always been able to avoid) the whites of my eyes get especially yellow. It is odd how the body plays with you", "Thalassemia Beta Trait | Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis, Pregnancy ", "Clueless on thalassemia, but I have it HELP I guess it is not a good idea to self diagnose a serious blood condition, but I currently do not have health care and thalassemia runs heavy in my family. I have been feeling super lethargic and overall not my best recently and got some lab panels to see what was going. \n\nCBC Panel:\n\nHEMATOCRIT - \u201839.3\u2019 low end of normal. I am a male and participate in heavy weightlifting and body building so having a hematocrit of a 12 year old girl kind of bothers me\n\nRBC VOLUME - \u201866.7\u2019 Range is 80-100\nMEAN RBC IRON - \u201820.9\u2019 Range is 27-33\nMEAN RBC IRON CONC. - \u201831.3\u2019 Range 32-36\nRBC DISTRIB WIDTH - \u201819.5\u2019 high range is 11-15\nRBC COUNT - \u20185.89\u2019 slightly high\nHEMOGLOBIN - \u201812.3\u2019 I have seen some people on here with much lower so I am glad about that at least.\n\nBasically I am clueless on thalassemia and am asking for general advice on how to improve these numbers if that is even possible. Also to know if my condition is on the worse end or if it is more minor. If this is something I have to live with I need information to understand HOW to live with it healthily and enjoyably. Also both of my liver enzymes were double normal, assuming due to iron overload because I can guarantee I get sufficient, if not excessive iron because I thought my problem was due to iron deficiency which now I understand is quite the opposite. I have since lowered my intake. I have slightly worse numbers than you.  Beta has hardly effected my life except for ruling out becoming a professional athlete.\n\nYou cannot improve your numbers.  That is just what your body is at it is natural levels.  Do not try and supplement your diet you will just make yourself sick.  Eat in moderation.  Exercise in moderation.  Keep your weight under control.\n\nExpert advice is thin on the ground.\n\nConsidering all the body sacrifices and extremes of diet and exercise involved in body building I would suggest it might be time to retire just in case you do yourself some damage to your organs accidentally. But everyone is different and you will work it out. What do you mean by supplement my diet? And what kind of damage could I do by weightlifting. I do not mean bodybuilding as in heavy weight gain followed by cutting down to very low body fat. Just overall size gain and decent leanness throughout my whole life. Unfortunately, that is normal with people that have thalassemia, particularly thal minor. I have alpha thal minor and your CBC is far better than mine. As of my last draw\n\nHGB: 12.1\n\nHCT: 38\n\nRBC: 5.19\n\nAnd I workout, run, and am a marathoner. I eat a clean whole food plant based diet and make sure I take b12/D3/DHA supplements. There is only so much you can do considering this is a genetic disease which caps the ceiling of how efficient you can get your blood to be. Well, you said you did bodybuilding, and you will be aware that bodybuilding has connotations of cutting down, taking supplements, going to extremes, etc.  If you do those things you might find down the road in your forties or fifties that you have completely fucked up your kidneys or liver or pancreas or whatever.  When you read in a blog or in a magazine that taking X helps you do Y, be aware that the writer has no understanding of your condition, and that for you taking X might set off a series of complications that does you lasting damage.\n\nIf you are just aiming at weightlifting and a good body composition then that is something different.  But you will still find that you do not get the results that others will because your body is fundamentally hampered by a genetic disease.\n\nYou cannot do the things that others do and get the same results, and you have to be aware of that and aware that it cannot be fixed.\n\nI am sorry it is a stark message.  On the upside, like u/TheGhostAgent , you are in a good position to manage your genetic disease because you are healthy and working positively on your body. I am impressed that u/TheGhostAgent can run marathons. I appreciate the responses! So I guess what I really want to know is how to improve my overall quality of life. There is been times where I felt great, no fatigue or symptoms of anemia(at least if there were, they were minor). The thing is I picked up heavy weightlifting aka powerlifting a little over a year ago and my progress had actually been phenomenal, I got stronger and gained a decent amount of size a lot quicker than most people I knew. I also felt pretty great at that time overall, but when I think about it I did kind of pick up a caffeine and pre workout dependence lol i do not remember if I was very fatigued at that time tho. That being said it do feel as though my endurance overall when it comes to high rep intensity was not always the best. That is because of the low iron, hemoglobin and hematocrit? I also play basketball very intensely and never had any problems with endurance in that case. I was also lower in body weight at the time something to keep in mind. Like you said moderate body weight? What does that do for you? Does having a lower overall bodyweight ease stress on your body? What if it was lean body weight and less fat. I am about 190 lbs 5\u201911. I am by no means \u2018fat\u2019 but I was leaner at the times I described. Not by a large amount tho. Sorry I know it is a lot and I understand if you do not want to or cannot answer it all. 190 lbs is 86.26 kg I am really not qualified to answer your questions. I found this place while looking for my own answers.\n\nThe extent of my knowledge is the basics learned through being a 2nd gen \u201cknown\u201d sufferer - do not get fat or you will get diabetes, do not mess with iron supplements or you will get sick, eat properly and regularly or you will faint, do not measure your fitness against non-thals because they can naturally do more, make sure you tell any medical professionals that you have it, and always remember that your body is built differently when you read dietary/lifestyle/fitness advice.\n\nOh, and the really big one - make sure your partner does not have it before you have kids. \n\nYou will be fine. I have Beta Thalassemia, Dominant which is a rare form of Thalassemia. My Hemoglobin has gotten as low as 8, my Hematocrit has been as low as 30, my MCV has been as low as 72, my MCH has been as low as 23, my MCHC has been as low as 30, and my platelets have dropped as low as 3,000 all depending on the severity of my hemolytic crises. I have noticed that my RBC seem to increase during a crisis probably because younger/newer red blood cells are larger than older red blood cells. I have also found that MCV, MCHC, MCH results yield more accurate data about my blood disorder status than \nmy hemoglobin results. Other tests that are helpful are haptoglobin tests which can confirm or rule out hemolytic anemia. And blood smear tests which can identify inherited hemoglobinopathies and genetic blood disorders by identifying certain abnormal red blood cell shapes and distributions. Not a marathon pace to brag about really. Takes a long build up time, patience, and proper diet. We take a longer time to recover and cannot use the same work out schedules as prescribed by online coaches or running books/resources. I am only able to handle 2 workouts instead of 3 per week. For the traditional runner, they can do a interval/speed, lactate threshold/tempo, and then a long run per week. I can only pull off 1 long run and then alternate between speed and tempo. The rest o  the days are slow easy runs at a low heart rate. These are things we need to compromise given our condition. It is doable, just need to be more judicious about how we go about it.  What is Beta Thalassemia Dominant? What sort of blood test identifies this? \n\nMy numbers are similar to yours with the exception of my MCV and MCH which, upon my last bloodwork, were 65 and 20.5, respectively. (Iron studies are always normal.)\n\nMy hemoglobin and hematocrit generally hover around the low end of the normal range or just below, though they drop when I am sick. The last time I was hospitalized (gallbladder), my hemoglobin was as low as 8. (I do not recall what the other related values were.)\n\nCould I possibly have the same variant of btm? Is there any benefit in knowing/being tested for this? Thx. Pete Sampras has beta thalassemia minor, as does former professional soccer player Zinedine Zidane (\u201cZizou\"). I found this from a medical article and it explains Beta Thalassemia Dominant:\n\n\"Dominant \u03b2-thalassemias are rare. In contrast to typical \u03b2-thalassemias heterozygotes which are completely asymptomatic with normal blood counts and peripheral blood film, these cases (dominant \u03b2-thalassemias) present clinically with splenomegaly, jaundice, anemia, and increased incidence of gallstones. A spectrum of molecular abnormalities including missense and nonsense mutations can lead to a dominant \u03b2-thalassemia phenotype. The common denominator of these mutations is the predicted synthesis of highly unstable \u03b2-chain variants.\u00a0\u00a0The phenotype resembles the intermediate forms of \u03b2-thalassemia by virtue of the ineffective erythropoiesis, but there is also a variable degree of peripheral hemolysis. Gene sequencing is required for confirmation of diagnosis of dominant \u03b2-thalassemia\".\n\nThalassemia is usually diagnosed via a hemoglobin electrophoresis test, but Beta Thalassemia,Dominant has to be diagnosed via genetic testing. My hemoglobin electrophoresis test was negative but my Health DNA test showed that I have Beta Thalassemia, Dominant and G6PD Deficiency. Unfortunately my Hematologist is pretty green when it comes to his knowledge and treatment about patients with inherited hemoglobinopathies and genetic blood disorders. He has tried to prescribe me contraindicated meds a few times and he asks questions like, \"why are your red blood cells so small?\"\ud83e\udd26 When I have a hemolytic crisis I usually go to the ER for treatment. Btw-gallbladder issues are common in people with Beta Thalassemia, Dominant. I have had to get intermittent blood transfusions during a Beta Thalassemia hemolytic crisis. Although both Beta Thalassemia and G6PD Deficiency can both cause hemolytic crises, I know if it is due to Beta Thalassemia if my feet/legs hurt really bad. Wow, I am sorry for all you have been through. I really think it would be to your benefit to get another hematologist.\n\nDid your insurance cover the genetic testing? Thx again! I started looking into hematologists in my area who accept my insurance prior to the pandemic but I had to put it on hold for now. My insurance company did not cover my genetic testing. I was lucky enough to participate in a clinical study for people with Lupus via 23andMe and they performed a Health and Ancestry genetic test for free. I had to have my raw test results sequenced though because 23andMe only sequenced a few genetic disorders. I used Sequencing.com and it was pretty reasonable. It was around $6. I also had my son tested as Beta Thalassemia since it is inherited and G6PD Deficiency is a x linked genetic blood disorder. He has Beta Thalassemia, but the variant of G6PD Deficiency is class 5 which is asymptomatic. I have two variants of G6PD Deficiency and I am just happy he has the asymptomatic variant. I have a question for you. Were you born with jaundice? I have not ever been told that I was jaundiced as a newborn...will have to ask my mom about that. \n\nTo my knowledge, the only issue I have ever had with my liver was stones in the hepatic ducts. This was noted upon my cholecystectomy in August 2018 which turned out to be a big debacle. I was supposed to have it done by laparoscopy, but I had so many stones, they had to do open surgery including a common bile duct exploration since I had a lot of stones there as well. They were not able to retrieve the stones from my liver, so I was referred to Johns Hopkins to handle that. (I was out of town when this all happened, but I live in the Baltimore area which is why I was sent to JH.) I had them removed laparoscopically in Sept. 2018, then had *another* retained stone in my bile duct - which was missed the previous two times - removed a month later. TMI, I know. \n\nThroughout all of this, I never even mentioned the BTM since doctors have poo poo'd me all of my life whenever I have brought it up. My hemoglobin was as low as 8 during my hospital stay. None of the doctors said a word. When I had bloodwork done at JH, it was 9.something. Again...not a word.\n\nI do not know if the gallstones were related to the BTM, but unless I could find a dr. who is actually knowledgeable in this area, I will not bring it up.\n\nSince all of the gallbladder issues, I have developed skin mottling on my arms and more recently on my legs. (It all began in November 2018.) I also have unexplained bruising and random red and purple spots. I do not believe I have leukemia because my platelet and WBC counts were normal upon my last routine bloodwork in early July. It is really almost as if those surgeries in August Sept. and October of 2018 triggered something...what, Idk. Of course, the timing could be totally coincidental. \n\nI am glad your son is okay. I have no idea what G6PD is. I am sorry you have Lupus...are those with BTM prone to autoimmune disease?\n\nSorry for going off on a tangent... It can actually give you an advantage in certain sports.  The higher RBC count means your adversaries will it their Vo2Max sooner than you, so very useful in sports were you have short high intensity bursts of energy, where your like tennis, football and such.  Low hemoglobin is crap for endurance though. &gt;What do you mean by supplement my diet? And what kind of damage could I do by weightlifting\n\nNo damage. I do weightlifting, it is a great sport for people with thalassemia. Crossfit is also good. We suck at endurance sports, but you can do it also.  \nThe staple supplementation for b-thal is folic acid. I also like taurine as helps tremendously with my migraines but i am not sure that is related to thalassemia. Also whey and instant oats  before ooing to the gym. I read that Pete Sampras' strategy was to use most of his energy in the beginning part of the match to tire his opponent out...then when he began to run out of steam because of his BTM, they would more or less be on even keel. \n\nI do not think he disclosed that he has BTM until after he retired from tennis. Idk, I guess his opponents could have used tactics to take advantage of it. Stop taking iron my bro you got thalassemia minor that for sure \n\nMy advice to you is \n\nFolic acid daily 2 mg \n\nZinc and cooper diet minerals \n\nMultivitamin \n\nMagnesium \n\nAnd try to stimulate EPO With different naturals ways (not injecting) because that is the only way to up you haemoglobin levels because the red blood are smaller they cannot carry hemoglobin as normal blood cells so their quantity compensate their smaller forms so the only way is to have a high number of them to rise hemoglobin levels (but not higher number that can make you more prone to clots and thrombosis accidents) Yes, you should avoid iron supplements and iron rich foods (red meat, broccoli, spinnach, etc are high in iron). You should not avoid them altogether, because of other things they provide, just do not have them in excess. You can lead a perfectly normal life, including sports. You will probably have an enlarged spleen, as it will work overtime to get rid of excess iron, but that has never stopped me from doing endurance sports and i was above average at it too. Currently am doing rock climbing 3 times per week at a climbing gym and during summer go real rock climbing on weekends.\n\nWhat you should do, is make sure your partner gets tested and is not a carrier or has it as well, if you decide to have children.  Inheritance model and percentages here: (\n\nAs other dude said, there is nothing you can do about the numbers, except maybe folic acid, improves it a little if you never had it, but do not expect miracles. I have been on folic acid at some point, other than improving that number a little (maybe), I did not notice any major improvements.", "Beta thal minor symptoms besides fatigue? Hey all. I am 25yo, have known I have beta thalassemia minor since my mom told me when I was a kid. I never did anything with the knowledge since my mom said I am just a carrier and should not have symptoms (even though she told me after I threw up and passed out at a karate lesson when I was a kid...). In more recent years I have begun to wonder if my symptoms are related to the beta thal minor, but again, doctors would tell me it does not cause any symptoms. I felt like I was crazy because I definitely experience symptoms that seem to align with being anemic, and the numbers show I have anemia, so how does that not cause symptoms, even if it is not severe enough to need transfusions? My doctor did tell me to take folic acid though, so I have been doing that. I do not really know if it is helped or not. There is not a huge noticeable difference, in any case.\n\nI found this reddit recently and saw people talking about how people with beta thal minor DO report symptoms, which brings me some relief (in that I do not feel like I am going crazy/potentially have answers), but the most common symptom listed is fatigue, which I definitely experience, but I experience other stuff that seems like it could be linked to anemia, too. I am hoping to get some insights as to whether this is related to the thal minor, if anyone else experiences the same things, and if so, has tips on managing symptoms!\n\nSo beyond fatigue, I tend to get lightheaded easily. If I stand up too fast after sitting, or crouch down and stand up, etc., I get dizzy and sometimes my vision even blacks out for few seconds. I also get lightheaded if I am just standing up for too long (usually if I am standing stationary and not moving around). Certain exercises or postures (unfortunately I do not remember what specifically) seem to cause lightheadedness as well, as in my reference to passing out in karate above. It nearly happened in P.E. back in high school as well, but I asked to sit down and felt better after a bit. My hands and feet get cold easily, which does not really bother me because I do not notice it, but my partner definitely does haha. Also, my lips have always been really pale, which I am kind of self-conscious about after a few different people pointed it out to me when I was younger. My partner gets period-related iron deficiency anemia, and one time she suddenly felt bad while exercising. Her lips turned really pale for a few minutes, which freaked me out because I would never seen that happen before, and then I realized that is how I must look all the time.\n\nAnywho, I am mostly concerned about managing the fatigue and lightheadedness, and hearing if anyone else can relate to certain postures or exercises affecting them. Let me know! All I can say is I also get the black fuzzy vision and lightheadedness when I stand up too fast. I am pretty lazy so cannot comment on the exercise stuff.\n\nBe aware that if you decide to have kids one day, they (edit: they as in your partner) need to be tested for thal or related blood disorders to prevent the chance of having a child with thal major. It could also be something like POTS. I completely relate. I feel lightheaded randomly pretty often, and even blackout for a few seconds during basketball games occasionally but that does not stop me to do sports, I just immediately sit down and put my head between my knees until it feels better. \n\nsleep right, definitely take care of your diet and maybe acupressure can help, it works for me when I used to get it regularly. I got to say that is pretty alarming to me, but I hope you are paying attention to your body and taking care of yourself! I am not a super active person and I want to exercise more, but it is tough when I do not have a good sense of my limits (partly because, like you, the lightheadedness can feel random) and I am afraid of pushing myself too hard. I had not heard of that! I will look into it. Well yep those things happens when I am not being careful about my lifestyle (less sleep, not taking folic acid, not eating nutritious food, stress, etc)\n\nIt is actually good to exercise lightly, some people with thal beta minor might not able to follow heavy cardio and stuff but do find out what works for you. You can explore and start slow. Maybe yoga? Thal major here, I can relate to all of your symptoms and yes it is completely normal to get anemia 'like' symptoms, if you feel them too severly do consult a different doctor who might help but other than that just follow general advices like do not push yourself too much, stay hydrated, take folic acid \\ and yep that is it, nothing much to worry bout. \\^This is super important, cannot emphasize enough. Yeah most beta Thal are lazy it is because of fatigue I cannot run as fast as other people without running out of oxygen.  Something I did not realize was part of lacking oxygen in the blood. I tried and tried so hard as a kid. How is your blood pressure? Sometimes low blood pressure can make you feel woozy and lightheaded. I have had episodes of barely being able to stand up and being totally dizzy/nauseous/vomiting in the morning because I did not drink my morning coffee fast enough and my blood pressure was too low. Hm, my blood pressure is always normal when I get check-ups, but maybe it fluctuates throughout the day? Honestly, whenever I tell a doctor about my symptoms, they check my thyroid, liver, whatever else and everything is always normal except for the stuff that is presumably related to the thal, e.g. hemoglobin. It is just something to consider/ask your doctor about! Possibly also blood sugar? I had joined the Army a couple years back without knowing I had beta thal minor, and throughout my whole career people looked at me weird because I was so skinny yet could not manage to outrun people much bulkier than me. I did not understand it either so I sympathize a lot. I tried and trained harder than anyone I know and yet still managed to do at best averagely on the physical fitness tests. Me too! I was diagnosed with Postural Hypotension, but I do not know what causes it. I have been wandering if it is the beta thalassemia minor too. I feel horrible, always tired too, but doctors say it should be asymptomatic.", "Frustrated with hematologists I have come to realize that going to the hematologist when you have beta thalassemia minor is an exercise in futility. \n\nShe was an hour and 15 minutes late for my appointment, did not review my chart beforehand, and stated, \u201cthalassemia trait does not cause symptoms. So you either do not have thalassemia trait or it is just your mood disorder\u201d... Well screw you too, doc. Then proceeded to perform what I felt was a completely unnecessary breast exam (considering I told her my gynecologist just did a breast exam 3 months ago), followed by checking only some lymph nodes and not others (checked right axillary lymph nodes, but not left; checked left inguinal lymph nodes, but not right). \n\nI sincerely doubt Stanford got my diagnosis wrong, and I also doubt that I have had depression since I was born... so what do those of you with beta thal minor do to help yourselves, since the hematologist apparently cannot be bothered? \n\nI currently take folic acid (1 mg), vitamin D3 (2000 IU), and vitamin K2 (100 mcg). Find a different doctor. Everyone on here with the trait has symptoms. Just because there has not been enough research to prove it does not mean it is nonexistent. Just think about all of the diseases in the past that did not come to light until science made a breakthrough. \n\nI had to request a blood smear to prove I was anemic. Even though there is no treatment I know my doctor will take it into consideration on my next visit. It is hard to find people who understand how you feel. \n\nMake sure you are getting enough B vitamins. Try to take care of yourself in general. It sounds like you might just be chronically fatigued, which is making you depressed. That is just my opinion though. Hope you feel better soon! Doctor sounds like she does not know her ass from her elbow.  See someone else. \n\nDo you know what your lab results are? How is your haemoglobin count? In terms of the vitamin D, I always take it (and all my vitamins) with food.\n\n* Hemoglobin is 9.3 g/dL (desired range is 11.7-15.5)\n* Hematocrit is 30.5% (desired range = 35.0-45.0)\n* MCV is 65.0 fL (desired range = 80.0-100.0)\n* MCH is 19.8 pg (desired range = 27.0-33.0)\n* MCHC is 30.5 g/dL  (desired range = 32.0-36.0)\n* RBC distribution width is 16.7% (desired range = 11.0-15.0)\n* RBC count is 4.69 million/uL (desired range = 3.80-5.10).\n\nOver the years, I have never seen my hemoglobin above 10 or my hematocrit above 32. I am definitely going to ask my PCP to refer me to a different hematologist, cause this doc was a joke. &gt;It sounds like you might just be chronically fatigued, which is making you depressed\n\nI do think that is a possibility. \n\nI am definitely going to ask my PCP to send me to a different hematologist. Something that helped a little bit with my depression was probiotics. I started out with children\u2019s probiotics, before switching to women\u2019s probiotics. They helped me a lot. Any particular brand that you recommend? I have heard really good things about the Silver Fern brand definitely get a new hematologist.  Some things I have tried that seem to be helping to keep my Hb up is B12, B6, I switched from folic acid to methylated folate and take a high dosage, and I added wheatgrass into my diet. I just take Culturelle right now because I had a coupon for them. If you are lactose intolerant though I would go for plant based. I should probably switch mine over once I run out. I should check out B12 as well. I am sensitive to wheat and gluten, so I probably cannot do the wheatgrass. \n\nIn your experience, do you notice a significant different between the regular folic acid and the methylated folate? Oh baby your hematocrit is worse than mine. Our hemoglobin is the same. Has your doctors checked your iron stores?   \n\nGood, vitamin d should be taken with food.  Do you take any meds? Any proton pump inhibitors?  Calcium, magnesium and zinc along with the b vitamins can be helpful in building the hemoglobin.   My doctor wants me to have IV iron infusions because my stores are at 4.  \n\nMy sister who also has beta has had iron infusions also due to low stores which have made a huge difference for her. Vitamin e, mixed tocopherols, 400-800 iu per day may help. Check out pubmed, vitamin e thalassemia. Tsh would be a good test as well. They focus so much on genetics that they do not see what is right in front of them. I do need to have my iron checked. \n\nNo proton pump inhibitors; I do take two medications, but neither impact absorption of micronutrients. I have never had pica or any desire to eat non-food items. \n\nI will definitely ask my PCP or next hematologist to examine my iron stores. All of my thyroid tests were normal. \n\nI will definitely pull up some research on vitamin E! Thank you! Out of curiosity, how is your cholesterol? It is down 30 points! \ud83d\ude01 back to within normal range. Now I just need to work on my triglycerides! In my case, being heterozygous for the MTHFR mutation, yes.  Studies say about half of us have it.  It causes folic acid to not be metabolized as efficiently, but methylated folate bypasses several steps in the process and can be directly absorbed.  You could ask a dr to test you for it, or I have heard the DNA tests like 23 and me will tell you if you have it.  Essentially, if you have the mutation (either 2 copies or 1) your folic acid could be useless to take, and in some cases cause problems. Very good haha. High cortisol can be associated with high triglycerides, something to consider. Here is an article on misunderstandings in thyroid testing, in case you are interested. Sometimes there can be hypothyroidism despite normal thyroid tests. In any case, congratulations on your progress. . .  Thank you!!  Here is mine for comparison:\n\n* Hemoglobin is 12.6 g/dL (desired range is 13.5-17.5)\n* Hematocrit is 40.1% (desired range = 41.0-53.0)\n* MCV is 61.0 fL (desired range = 80.0-100.0)\n* MCH is 19.0 pg (desired range = 26.0-34.0)\n* MCHC is 31.0 g/dL (desired range = 31.0-37.0)\n* RBC distribution width is 15.0% (desired range = 11.6-14.0)\n* RBC count is 6.53 million/uL (desired range = 4.5-5.9)\n\nI am guessing your RBC count should be higher? That is how the body compensates for the lower hemoglobin. LOL I was going to write a similar post. Went to a hematologist hoping I could get red blood cell infusions. He did a comprehensive blood work and told me he could not find anything surprising. And I was totally unsurprized that he could not find anything surprising. \n\nHe told me thal minor did not need treatment which basically means that you should not go to a hematologist for thal minor. I realized I knew more than he did about thal. For example I found an article in the Joural of Gerontology that shows non-iron deficiency anemia (which is the type we have) can cause insomnia which may be why nothing can seem to help me get a good night's sleep. He was not even willing to *think* why my HGB has decreased recently. And this is important. Most doctor's cannot think outside the box, they are not researchers. They just parrot what the've read in textbooks. Depression is the boogeyman that doctors blame things on when they have no clue.\n\nYour best bet is to use this subreddit  and other patient's experience, eat healthy and work out (as much as you can). I went for the beta thal minor. I am 31 Yes but thal is a genetic disorder. Doctors cannot wave their magic wands and make our bone marrows produce good red blood cells. At least not for now. The only way to help, if your HGB is not low enough for infusions, is supplements and lifestyle changes.", "Always test with low MCV, low MCH, high RDW pointing to microcytic anemia, could thalassemia be it? My father is being referred to a hematologist because his hemoglobin and transferrin levels are low despite regular iron supplements. What should I expect?", "Blackout when taking blood Hey there! I am a 24y.o. male and have thal minor as I found out about 2 years ago. I guess (or hope) that this is the solution to my increasing tiredness (I will now start to try folate, magnesia, taurine, vitamin d and maybe ashwaganda). But something unusual happened yesterday. When I went to the doc to get my blood tested (my first/last test was when I was diagnosed with thal) I almost blacked out when my blood was taken. At least it felt like the temperature increased indefinitely, I got pale and could not see straight anymore so I had to lay down. This never happened before and is not a psychological thing as I have no problems with blood/needles. Could this bis related to thalassemia? Thanks in advance and sorry for any potential mistakes (no native speaker)! I had that happen once when I donated a full unit of blood before I knew I had thal minor.  I usually get a bit squeamish when having blood taken for tests, but never really severe if I just look away and breathe deeply.  I chalk it up to just a subconscious thing. I have thal minor and It happened to me as well, the only difference was i actually passed out, when I came to, my forehead was sweating. ", "This is what I found on Covid-19 and Thalassemia  Put link to article please This is the link to the article:\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it is one of those medical sites that want you to register. I tried to put the most summarized info up in case people did not want to give out their email. Interesting read. Thank you for sharing. I wonder how COVID19 affects people with G6PD Deficiency or chronic ITP? I have Beta Thalassemia, G6PD Deficiency, and Chronic ITP. I know that we are less susceptible to Malaria and some other infectious diseases, but I wonder how we fair with COVID19. Infections are a big trigger for hemolytic crises, but I wonder if it is more difficult for viruses to attach to our cells because our cells have issues even carrying oxygen throughout the body. I had to be hospitalized last month due to a severe hemolytic crisis and I could not figure out what triggered it ( it was not from foods or meds). Now I realize that it was probably because I was exposed to someone with COVID19 (I was around a lot of people traveling to and from China at LAX). My husband got sick afterwards and is still sick although he has not been tested for COVID19. He has all of the symptoms, and I had most symptoms for a few days and then I started getting the symptoms of hemolysis including chest pain, shortness of breathe, jaundice, amber colored urine, fatigue, and weakness. I had to be put on oxygen, all of my blood draw samples were hemolyzed, my platelets were low, and my haptoglobin indicted hemolytic anemia. I had to get two blood transfusions and increased my folate and B12. I feel fine now. I will get an COVID19 antibody test soon because I want to know if I had it.

No not true. My dad has it my mom does not and my sister and I both have it. I am talking about the gender of of siblings not about a wife and her husband \n\nSo you and your sister have it :\n\nResult: 2 girls have it we got the same gender . I do not have any brothers but my dad has three sisters and two have it along with him. Yeah I see his sisters are confirmed having it ? I think it is just coincidence I do not know i think even it does not apply literally its prevalent. Have you found studies supporting this? That is the only way to answer your question otherwise you are looking at a tiny sample size and just drawing conclusions... that I am not even clear about from your post.\n\nMy family: grandma was a carrier and passed it on to her daughter but not to her 2 sons. My mom (the daughter) passed it to me but not my sister. I am female btw\n\nI have never heard of gender increasing your odds, but if there are studies, I would love to read them since I am having a hard time finding any. Accttually there a lack of studies about that because its a rare disorder or because they are not interested in the results or i do not know. \n\nSo I did not have studies supporting that any as i cited post before its just an hypothesis so it can be true not . To add to your data set:  I am one of 8 children, 6 boys and 2 girls. My father had the trait. 5/6 boys inherited the trait.  0/2 girls did.  I have three kids, 2 boys and 1 girl. One of my sons inherited the trait; my daughter did not.  Not sure yet about my other son.  Good luck with your research! Yes. It shows up anytime you get a blood panel done so we all get told about it allllll the time. I think that it is coincidence in your situation I mean. My dad has it, mom does not. I have it, my brother has it. In general I do not think it is more common in males or females, it just happened to be that way in your situation The mutation is located on chromosome 11, which is not the gender chromosome.  It is not related to gender at all. I do not mean that its occurs in one gender I told its likely to happen in one gender in kids Nope. I am one of 4 daughters, half of us are carriers, half are not. This has nothing to do with biosex Yeah i see that true but i think its prevalent. Sometimes i feel unlucky to have it while my siblings do not. I have question can you tell me the difference between you and siblings who does not have it ? Have noticed a difference between you and your siblings which are not carriers in everything for example maybe studying having relationships whatever you see that there is a difference? I do not know what differences you are looking for. Differences in anything you think is related to being a carrier compared with none carriers. This is not actually how sex-linked genetic mutations work. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, the 23rd pair being the only one that determines sex. Two \u2018X genes\u2019 codes for girl and an \u2018X, Y\u2019, if a child is a boy, he will have gotten his father\u2019s Y chromosome and one of his mother\u2019s X chromosomes. This happens with every pair. Since the pairs with hemoglobin genes are not on the sex-linked (X or Y) chromosome, they are independent of gender. ( Actually currently there was a survey to record this data in AFMC, Pune, India and we found out that it is actually more prevalent in males even though gene have an equal distribution and the factor should be independent of gender so that is that I guess.", "Thalassemia minor I have thalassemia minor, can i take iron supplements? nope, not really, only if you are really low on iron As always, talk with your doctor though please make sure they are very familiar with the condition (many are not and treat it more like anemia).  I recommend against iron supplements as it can lead to chronic liver damage in those with thal. Chronic liver damage in thalassemia major or minor? Minor, but do not be too scared it is not as bad as it may have sounded:\n\nAs our blood creation cycle is kind of' in hyper active mode, constantly creating blood cells, many of which are destroyed that leaves us with higher than normal levels of iron being processed through the liver.  In time that can lead to hepatic (liver) iron overload.  That would be made worse if taking iron supplements. But my iron level is low. It is 44.. still I cannot take iron supplements? It is 44. Can i take iron supplements? Right.\n\nIron is used in the process of creating red blood cells, but upon their failed creation that is filtered back out of the blood by the liver, leaving your iron level low.  But some of it does build-up in the liver over time.\n\nTaking vitamins with iron would bring that level up but also contribute to the build-up. Okay! Thank you so much. It helped me, also I will consult a doctor who is familiar with this. Absolutely the best answer!\n\nIt is a bit of a complicated and often misdiagnosed condition and no stranger off the Internet should be considered a real source of truth.\n\nBest of luck, but please rest assured that thal. is not terribly serious and is unlikely to have much if any impact on your life. Consult a haematologist, generally for us, iron binding capacity is low. As a result, ferritin levels cross limits easily on taking iron supplements. My wife has been on Exjade for years and it keeps her excess iron n check perfectly. The only issue is most health insurer's do not cover it. Going to meet hematologist next week to see what else they might have or else I need to get her an expensive plan. Even when we discuss this with other doctors they think we are BS'ing them. Talk to hematologist, they know the score. Exactly I took iron supplements for a month and it had little to no impact on my levels. I have thalassemia beta minor. Doctor advised against continuing as the risks outweighed any benefits. Best way to get your iron in is through diet, eat iron rich foods including organ meats like liver, red meat, leafy greens etc. How is your ferritin? Ferritin level is 4. It is low. Is exjade a drug? That is extremely low. You might qualify for a transfusion. Definitely try to get in and see a hematologist! Yes made by Novartis Can you please tell me in brief when do we need transfusion in thalassemia minor? i do not know how low it is too low, i think it depends on your weight and age, search online  I have thalassemia minor and instead of a blood transfusion I got an iron IV, my ferritin was 5. That is why I asked about your ferritin; maybe you can talk to a hematologist, for sure they will suggest the same. Another important thing is haemoglobine. If your haemoglobin is low like below 8 (or 80 depending on the scales they use) a blood transfusion is needed. In case it is just slightly decreased, iron supplements will fix the problem.", "Newly diagnosed, confused as how to treat/move forward (Apologies in advance for formatting issues, I am on mobile). I was diagnosed recently with alpha thalassemia   It was a great relief to receive that diagnoses because things have never made sense in the time I have been getting bloodwork done as an adult (was not able to receive regular medical care as a child, have no access to what medical records there were due to religious reasons on my parent\u2019s part). I have a lot of health problems and get bloodwork frequently so it is a constant worry. I am so grateful to know and not be confused or anxious anymore. The thing is, the discovery was made on accident and investigated by a specialist that took great concern that no one else was looking into it and had a hunch. He does not treat blood disorders and had no other instructions for me other than to avoid iron supplements unless my ferritin specifically was tested. \n\nI have an appointment with my PCP soon and plan to bring this up. What questions do I need to be asking? Is it absolutely necessary to see a hematologist? I am so reluctant to go to one because they are often based in oncology units (at least in my town), and my father recently died of cancer and I am not prepared to walk into an oncology center for a very long time. Apart from questions to ask my doctor, or advice on hematologists, is there any nutrition or lifestyle advice anyone has? Hi.  I am sorry you have not had any answers.  I cannot be of much help as I have beta thalassemia and really do not knkw much about alpha or the differences.  I just wanted to offer my encouragement.\n\nAs for the hemotologist, I understand going into an oncology center is hard. Perhaps you can discuss these feelings with your PCP.  Unless you are having symptoms that require treatments such as transfusions or IV infusions, it may not be necessary for you to see a hemotologist, it really depends on you and how confident your pcp is on over seeing your care on the matter.\n\nMy advice is to do some reading on alpha thalassemia and from there form any questions you may want to ask.\n\nGood luck. It is probably the dumbest thing I will say on record but I really do not understand Thalassemia beyond Major and Minor. Yeah, this was not necessary.", "Difference between iron and hemoglobin I am very confused about the two. I have thalassemia minor. Hemoglobin is the vehicle that carries oxygen thru your body. Iron attaches to hemoglobin to essentially \"activate\" it. Thalassemia is caused by a mutation in the place where Iron attaches to hemoglobin, so the hemoglobin created from your mutated chromosome will not be able to bind to iron, and thus cannot carry oxygen. \n\nSince you are minor, your other chromosome will code for normal hemoglobin. Most of the time your body is smart and will adapt, making mostly the normal hemoglobin. But sometimes it cannot keep up and makes more of the faulty hemoglobin, which may make things harder for you (fatigue, shortness of breath, etc). Thanks for the response! So should I be taking iron pills? My rbc count is normal but hemoglobin is low.  Talk to your doctor first. Your iron levels might be normal even with low hemoglobin. Too much iron in your body is dangerous", "Does thalassemia minor affect us with the same severity level ? Or there is some deficiency with is or malabsorption.

So I never got help for my thalassemia it was basically just my doctors telling me I had it and that it does not cause symptoms. Fast forward a couple months I have headache, exhausted, and weakness AGAIN. I checked my last set of labs and over time my RBC count had shot up with no downward trend ( last test was 5.67 normal is 3.96-5.09). In the first blood smear in June said I did not have thalassemia and that my blood cells were microcytic. Flash forward to November and I was diagnosed with alpha thalassemia minor and my blood cells show microcytosis and hypochromasia. Both tests had a normal HPLC. As time passes I feel like I am slowly getting worse and I do not really know what to do. On top off all of this I also had a positive ANA (1:640 homogeneous). Tbh I think I just wanted to rant because all of this has been worrying me for months and when I start to feel sick I worry that I am just getting worse. Every doctor I went to seemed to have NO IDEA what thalassemia was or what is wrong with me. No one could explain why my ANA was so high but just kept saying \u201cyou probably do not have an auto immune disease\u201d. After being poked and prodded for months I gave up. Thanks for letting me rant. bro do you have your cbc ? lets conpare . i have mine here , are you a guy or girl? cuz that matters too , my rbc is just steady 6.70+ ever since , what is your hemoglobin and hematocrit ? \n\nI am a girl. \nMy RBC in Nov was 5.67\nMy hemoglobin and hematocrit were normal at 12.4 and 41.8 respectively But in true thalassemia fashion my MCV, MCH, and MCHC were all pretty low My mom wants me to get another CBC so if I can get in I will tell you the updated numbers you are actually more normal than me Has your doctor made a plan for you yet? yeah , i went to a hematologist when i got diagnosed 5 years ago , i am asymptomatic , and she just made sure that im stable , i asked her if i will live a normal life she said yes, my phenotype of the disease is good , and my prognosis is great. she had me do mri just to confirm my organs does not acrue iron , and it does not , after 1 year of just routine checkup with the hematologist she said that i would be ok , and i should stop going to her because my condition is stable , and just let her know if my symptoms get worse . I do blood work every time i see my pcp . Good to know! Thank you! As a beta thal major, I say your values are just slightly off perfect. I do not think you need to worry this much, Even if you are a minor, because my sister has beta thal minor and her values remain even lower than you, but she is almost absolutely healthy and even has kids. Just keep an eye and keep testing regularly to make sure things do not go off the chart. Ty!!! I was always told there is no symptoms too and was sent to a blood specialist who just told me yes you have it why are you here I cannot do anything for it.. I was told to suck it up buttercup and that is it I was 8 years old at the time.. I am 30 years old now still havnt found anyone who cares enough to help me out I am sorry you had to experience that! I feel your pain Thank you I am sorry anyone has to deal with it honestly Phenotype? Hi, I see your pain. I have thal minor too and was told by 3 GPs that it was nothing and untreatable after consulting for constant fatigue, headaches and breathlessness at work even though I was eating healthy and was taking multivitamins.\n\nSo I just did my own research and stumbled upon this blogger:\n\n\nI found that chlorophyll helps alot, and I feel better. Nutrition is key to manage your symptoms and doctors are not really knowledgeable about this and only you can make the change. OP, did you ever get any answers in regard to the thalassemia and the ANA titer abnormality? Nope my doctor is not seeing people in person right now because of covid so I am on hold until further notice lol Yeah for real, thanks again covid.\n\nBut when you can, you should not drop this. For me, I have had to push to be heard by certain doctors. Some of them only look at numbers but do not look at the whole case.\n\nLike I am confused by who saw your 1:640 ANA positive test and said it probably was not an autoimmune disease? Yes it is possible to be healthy and have that, but its not a definite. It is also possible it could be something else causing it, but that would not be something for them to drop the ball on either. A rheumatologist should be able to test more possible conditions to rule things out. If you do not think a doctor is being thorough enough, do not feel disheartened. Seek a second opinion without a second thought.\n\nMy autoimmune disease took quite a while to diagnose (and my number is even a little lower than yours). It is also kind of an attention hog. Any symptom I ever have gets blamed on it. My anemia was always written off due to malabsorption and I probably never would have gotten a thalassemia test if one of my parents did not test positive for it. \n\nI am not trying to scare you at all, just want to give you some encouragement. I did not have one doctor diagnose everything. It is been a chain of events and random tests that brought me from one to the next, but I eventually got there. You know your body, and know when you are unwell or a treatment is not working. If a doctor continuously dismisses my concerns without any explanation, I just drop them and find someone else.

Maybe the Hematologist will order this test for you. If you want to have kids, it will be good to know if you have the mutations or not so you can make an informed choice. I have a family history of beta thal..my son was just diagnosed with the trait due to blood testing but not DNA...how do they know it is minor without genetic testing? \n\nMy main concern is I recently did some digging on my 23andme dna data and my husband\u2019s as well and we both have HBB mutations. Pretty sure they need to do a DNA test to diagnose Thalassemia since its a condition caused by a mutation. Is there anyway or place I could order the test myself? I do not know of any - maybe make a separate post that asks this? Its an interesting question. More red blood cells than normal. Less hemoglobin than normal. That is the easy answer. Not really if you have a genetic history, it is pretty obvious with that piece of knowledge and the blood test. My blood work literally said on it something like \"blood cells indicative of thalassemia trait\". You do not need genetic testing to be diagnosed with thalassemia. So how are you diagnosed my dr told me I would need genetic testing to check my alleals. My Dr diagnosed me from the blood test alone. My blood test even said something like \"blood is consistent with thalassemia trait\". I have a family history so that helps. I feel like it would be fairly obvious given a detailed enough blood test, but maybe there are other factors in your case that make them uncertain?", "Thalassemia without anemia? Hi! My doctor found a high reticulocyte count on a blood test and it got higher when they retested. They were confused and wanted to test my iron. My iron was totally fine and normal as was my CBC (besides bilirubin - I have Gilbert\u2019s syndrome) but my ferritin was also high. They told me I probably have thalassemia  but I do not have anemia, everywhere I have seen on the internet says you have at least mild anemia with thalassemia. Family is from Eastern Europe. All of this leaves me super confused, does anemia and thalassemia always happen together? Are high reticulocyte and ferritin usually markers for thalassemia? \n\nThanks! Anemia is just poor oxygen delivery. It can just be feeling tired or tiring quickly with exercise. \n\nWith Thalassemia your body makes malformed blood cells so you have a high reticulocyte (big baby blood cells) count because your body thinks your not getting enough oxygen. The not getting enough oxygen is the anemia so you probably are anemic, hence the high reticulocyte count. \n\nFerritin is high because your body is hanging on to a lot of iron because it is not using it as much for the blood cells you make which are tinier than normal blood cells. This is Uber helpful. So it is still anemia/thalassemia even though my CBC and iron was totally normal? Yes. CBC is normal because you are making normal amounts of blood cells they are just smol. Free iron is normal because your body is making more ferritin to carrying around all the extra iron. They should have sent a sample to pathology who should be able to look at it and tell you but that profile does fit thalassemia. They said my MCV is 80, literally bottom of normal range, I did not ever look at that till now. I know those with it have low MCV, is mine considered high for thalassemia? Thank you again for all your help, I am literally clueless and it seems my doctors are also confused (bc they found reticulocyte while retesting bilirubin to confirm Gilbert\u2019s syndrome) Yep! Because your regular blood cells are tiny but you are making a lot of reticulocytes- that are bigger than average blood cells- your MCV or average blood cell volume is low/close to normal because your average is balanced by the really different sized cells. \n\nGilbert syndrome is something they would have been looking at with a different substance in your body. Bilirubin is a waste product that your liver processes to get rid of urea. Conjugated means it went to the liver and unconjugatrd means it has not yet. If you look up bilirubin metabolism you will find some videos that explain it better than I can. Show me :MCV and HBG and RDC of your CBC (complete blood count) MCV: 80\nRBC: 4.7\nHBG:13.1\nHCT:37\nWBC: 6.9 \nReticulocyte: rose from 2.9 Monday to 3.14 Wednesday You maybe have alpha thalssemia silent but not trait its totaly asymptomatic . Because if you got the trait you MCV will never be 80 or more to confirm the test you need have genetic testing. They are 2 totally different things", "What implications exist with the mRNA Covid Vaccine (Moderna/Pfeizer) if you have Beta Thalassemia Minor ? I have Beta Thalassemia Minor. I have the opportunity to get the Moderna vaccine.\n\nAll my research confirms the Vaccine is safe. But I have not found any literature specifically speaking to people with Beta Thalassemia Minor. My inclination is it is still safe, but I am not a medical professional and wanted a few more opinions.\n\n* Is there any implication for Beta Thalassemia Minor and the Covid mRNA vaccine?\n* Is there any additional cause for concern when getting the vaccine?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am hoping that the vaccine affects/interacts with a completely independent system as Beta Thalassemia Minor and that there are no implications of getting the vaccine. My bf got it. He had a really rough couple of days but was fine afterward. Thank you. I have thal major and got the moderna vaccine. I had a bit of a flu for about 24 hours after each shot and then was totally fine. I have alpha thal intermedia and I got both doses of moderna. The second dose I had a hemolytic reaction and was put on steroids to suppress my immune system after being in the hospital for 10 days. My case seems rare though and I have not heard of anyone else with thal having that happen to them My father and I both have thal minor. He got Moderna and I got Pfizer. He is 72 and I am 28. He got his shots in May and I got mine in April.\n\nHe was sick for a day after each shot, otherwise perfectly fine. He said second shot was worse.\n\nI was also sick for about a day after each, otherwise perfectly fine. I thought the first shot was worse. \n\nOur symptoms were no worse than anyone else I know who got them, including my mother and sister who do not have thal minor. I know some people who fared worse. But it is temporary, and Covid would be far worse. Especially since we are just now seeing the \"long haulers\" or long term effects of Covid.\n\nIf you want to get vaccinated, you should be perfectly fine. As we are a relatively small group obviously they have not tested specifically on people with thalassemia, but this is not the first mRNA vaccine so we have a really good idea how it will affect us. As always, if you are concerned you can ask your doctor. Remember, all vaccines and medicines work on a risk/reward system. Nothing is perfect. Weigh the possibilities of the vaccine to Covid and make an informed choice. Thank you for your response. Thank you for your comment. Thank you! Your welcome, I hope all the responses you got helped you make a choice either way. I am likely going through through with it. Probably always would have. Was just doing due diligence. I have also talked to a few Doctors, and they said there is no significant additional risk for having beta thal minor.", "Thalassemia minor and sex My girlfriend has thalassemia minor and we are looking forward to have safe penetrative sex and lose our virginity. Would the blood from hymen breaking cause any problem? And anything in general I should take care of?  No problem. Have thalassemia minor as well. I had no blood first time. If you both make sure she is aroused before and is into it, should not be painful and does not always cause blood, just as a general FYI (nothing to do with thalassemia). \n\nIn terms of thalassemia, she may get a little winded a little easier or maybe a little dizzy (like when you stand up too fast), but i do not think most thal minor people experience that very much. And if it is experienced, it likely is not anything serious just slow down until that goes away. Just as long as you both communicate with each other and respect the others needs, all is fine. If either of you want more info on the act itself, scarleteen is a good informational website (a lot better than any school based sex ed).   Thank you so much for your answer!

I want to make progress and feel better, but right now I am so far from where I want to be.\n\nThe only thing I have not really tried is diet change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance! The diet change might be what you need. Eliminate as much processed food as possible especially sugars. Try plant based but make sure you get pleanty of your B vitamins. Have you ever had a sleep study done? Thanks for your answer.\n\nRight now my diets consists of bread, eggs, veggies and fruits, meat, carbohydrates (rice, pasta etc.), nuts, coffee and like 20g of processed sugar a day. Do you think a plant-based diet would help?\n\nI did get tested for sleep apnea and the results were negative.\n\nI just cannot imagine why this condition affects me this hard. It is like I am a 90 year old. I cannot even run or work out once a week because my energy is so low. A plant based diet might help.  Who knows, you might have a food intolerance. I myself do not handle wheat very well (wheat not glutn). What Is your sleep schedule like? Do you go to bed at the same time every day, stay up late sometimes? For a diet change I would start with cutting out sugar/wheat - that always makes a huge difference for me. I am really strict with my sleep schedule I never sleep less than 9 hours and go to bed between 9.30 and 10.30.\n\nHave you tried cutting out coffee? I have read it dehydrates and hinders iron absorption. Maybe it messes with my sleep too even though I never drink it past 3 pm. So I struggled with this most of my life, trying to be plant based more than several times, and despite the balanced diet, supplements and natural iron sources, nothing was really right until I made sure I had at least 1 serving of lean red meat each week.  Careful going all plant based because those were the times I either wound up in the hospital or was close to it. Hi. I am sorry you are feeling this way. Are you taking any supplements? My hematologist recommended that I take 1 mg of folic acid daily to help with the health of my RBCs. It is a common treatment for those with intermedia and major so it makes sense that we follow similar guidelines. \n\n\n\n\nI also wanted to add that your hemoglobin may be normal but you may also have iron deficiency anemia. I had it so bad that I had to have iron infusions under careful supervision of a hematologist to prevent iron overload. My ferritin (iron stores) were almost 0. Iron was normal though!It is good to see if there are any other things going on that might contribute to your feelings. \n\nGood luck!", "Do you have any of these symptoms with Thalassemia? Hello everyone, has anyone had these symptoms leg and joint pain as a child, breathlessness; As an adult, hair loss in one spot, fatigue, back pain, seemingly healthy teeth chipping and then recently a scary bout of jaundice?\n\nSo back story, I spent the first 10 years of my life in a place that did not have the best medical resources. As a kids I constantly complained about leg pain. My mom took me to the doctor but he basically said I was lazy. I was often tired and out of breath but honestly the doctors words just made me think I was lazy and I dismissed my feelings. \n\nAt I moved back to the USA and experienced that same fatigue and then when I became a teenager my hair would randomly fall out. It was alopecia because it would grow back long, thick and healthy. \n\nAs an adult I felt unwell, weak, tired and my teeth would randomly chip. The dentist always said they do not know why that my teeth were healthy and clean. \n\nThey also started to shift dramatically leaving me with several gaps.\n\nLeg and back pain continued and a few months ago I got severe jaundice.\n\nDoctors had failed me usually saying it was a thyroid problem but my tests always had perfect results.\n\nDuring my thyroid episode foray doctor made me do tons of tests, MRI\nAnd endoscopy because she was convinced I had cancer or an autoimmune disease.\n\nStill, nothing.\n\nI went to a functional doctor and also decided to read all my labs the costs were months apart so I compared my blood tests and everything looks perfect except for MCV MCH and platelett count.\n\nI share this with my brother who is 20 years older than me and tell him from my googling I think I have thalassemia his response \u201coh I have that, I was diagnosed a few years ago\u201d thanks for sharing brother. \n\nAnyway another sibling also got diagnosed and I think my sister has it she was always weak and always had dark under eyes.\n\nI am getting tested with a hematologist right now but has anyone else had those symptoms?\n\nThanks all!", "Hello everyone.

My gp rulled out thalassemia since my hemoglobin is in range A lot of GPs have very little experience with thalassemia. Looking at just blood results like yours it is very hard if not impossible to be sure. To me intuitively it looks like you might be an alpha thalassemia carrier (either silent or trait, only way to know is to get a genetic test). You have more than normal red blood cells but they are smaller than usual \u2014&gt; either you lack iron or might have a form of thalassemia, however hemoglobine looks fine that is why I am thinking you are a carrier. Ps. I am not a GP - just a person living with thalassemia. I was always tired but my blood always looked perfect, now a few years later, my blood began to look worse (small rbc, high numbers of rbc) but no problems with hemoglobine. Anyway my test for thalassemia alpha minor came back positive. Thanks a ton. I have just ordered Hemoglobin Electrophoresis. Will it help to detect? Thanks Not necessarily, I had that done and it came back normal (but near the treshold) with the note to do a genetic test\u2026 Will it be worth checking my iron and ferritin levels again. That might be also the reason of high smaller blood cells Yeah sure, and best to do a blood test asap after waking up. Thanks a ton ! Also ask them for transferrin and iron saturation I guess it was included in my iron studies last time. Ans thanks again No problem! Did you ever get tested for autoimmune diseases (like lupus), there are many that cause fatigue. In early stages fatigue can be the only symptom. My inflammation markers( crp and esr)  are always low so i was not tested. Even for thalassemia I am going out of the way and testing. I first thought gastritis might be causing fatigue but after so many months it are not getting better and I am unable to work so had to take matters in my own hands Even I would get a note on my hameoglobin electrophoresis report to see if further testing is required ryt ?", "World Thalassemia day 2017| Thalassemia Definition  ", "Beta Thal Minor - struggling with fatigue.

I can only offer one person's experience, but can share what has worked for me. \n\n* Pick athletic activities that do not require a lot of extended cardio. Weight-lifting, hiking, and martial arts are good choices. They will keep you fit without depleting your oxygen. You will feel much more energetic when you are in good physical shape. \n\n* Definitely avoid iron supplements if you are beta minora. It does not do any good, and can actually make things worse. Your blood already has all the iron it can handle. Folks with alpha thal have a harder journey, but if you are beta thal you do not need supplements. Just keep a healthy diet and you will be fine. \n\n* There is no shame in taking naps. If you need to nod off for a few hours, go for it. Find a workplace that okay with you napping.

I currently take an iron supplement because my doctor did my blood work and my ferritin is very low, You can also be anemic with thal beta minor so it is a good idea to ask your doctor to check your ferritin stores because if they are too low then you need an iron supplement. just make sure that if you start taking one they monitor you and check it every 4 to 6 weeks to make sure you are not getting too much iron once your store start to go up.

I am starting to think maybe it has to do with my blood condition. Anyone else with a similar problem? I was wondering if people with Beta Thalassemia had issues gaining and maintaining a healthy weight. I have always been in the 10th percentile for weight among females in my age range, but was in the 97th percentile for height. I have tried everything to gain and maintain weight, but I cannot keep weight on. Up until 6 months ago I was on Prednisone so I had more luck keeping weight on but now I am struggling to put at least 20lbs on.  The only other person I have ever met in person with Beta Thalassemia (the daughter of a co worker) is also underweight. I noticed that you mentioned that you have chronic iron deficiency. Did your doctor test your ferritin blood serum? Because beta thalassemia and iron deficiency anemia look similar on lab tests. If you are not actually iron deficient, then talking iron supplements can lead to iron overload (which I think increase oxidative stress and inflammation throughout the body). Water retention may contribute to weight gain. Anemia in people with Beta Thalassemia and other inherited blood disorders, is usually due to folate deficiency as opposed to iron deficiency, but a lot of Hemotalogists do not know this. Here is the article I showed my Hemotalogist when he kept trying to prescribe me iron supplements, eventhough my ferritin blood serum levels are always within normal range.

Also plz do not overdo things if you have normal BMI. yes! i just came across the sub after yeas of back and forth to my GP wondering if there are any other deficiencies to simply treat for why i feel like shit 24/7, why i cannot exercise, why i cannot lose any weight and it just keeps creeping up. i have no energy and will spend all day in bed if i can. i just cannot bring myself to even go for a walk. i cannot even last a day at a fulltime job and have had to drop to part time\n\nI have know about my beta thalassaemia my whole and have suffered from eating disorders more than half my life as well so i just put it down to my ED. but I finally, after another set of blood tests, have just admitted to myself that there is nothing i can do about it and will probably live in the constant struggle forever. \n\ni am about 10kg overweight and i am fucking over it. i wish there was a magic answer but there is not As someone who is been overweight while being Thal major all my life, I can answer this.   \n\n\nThe easiest way to go about it is introducing minor changes in your lifestyle.

First study says that individuals with beta thalassemia did not have worse outcomes than individuals who did not. Meaning, it may not be considered one of the \u2018pre-existing\u2019 conditions that can make you at risk to be more severely affected by COVID-19. \n\nThe second and third study suggest that there may be some immunity to COVID-19 if you have beta thalassemia. \n\nIt is important to note that these studies have small sample studies, and discussed that there would need to be more evidence to support these claims. COVID's infection pathways use hemoglobin, our hemoglobin is effed-up, and there is some evidence that this gives us resistance similar to resistance to malaria for similar reasons. Italy turned out to be a useful test case because of its high rates of both thalassemia and COVID. I view the first study as something actually very positive. These were beta-thal majors with a bunch of comorbidities that did surprisingly well. Some of them ( and none even required intubation. I just wished for a larger cohort size and inclusion of minors. I have not read these specific  studies but the ones I did read were very....correlation vs causation. I will get back to these tomorrow but if someone whos read them wants to give me the quick run down, were any actual science/medical based tests performed or did they just use a thalassemia possessing sample against a non thalassemia possessing group and look at overall response/patient health? what I am specifically asking here is are these studies observations or were blood labs drawn and tested against the virus itself. What is the latest on BETA THAL TRAIT and COVID resistance?", "A STUDY Hi folks, 17y old beta thal major here, I need your help regarding my future decision making concerning my studies and immigration prospects so if possible can you all kindly send the basic structure of thalassemia management in your country and the costs involved along with different other formalities like insurance or uo-front payment.\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time out to help, Good day to you !", "Symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Beta Thalassemia minor Hi,\n\ncan anyone think of reasons why there are some people with Beta Thalassemia Minor who experience no or close to no symptoms and others experience quite extreme symptoms like fatigue, dizziness and tiredness?\n\nReally baffles me how I cannot come close to living a normal life and other people with the same condition run marathons and have normal careers etc.\n\nThanks!

My parents took me to the doctor when they realized I was losing weight rapidly, having a high fever at almost 100\u00b0 for a week now and severely pale skin along with diarrhea. My parents took me to Calcutta Homeopathic medical college and hospital where I was wrongly diagnosed for having jaundice. \n\nFast forward barely a day later I fainted while my mom was feeding me and they immediately took me to the local primary Healthcare centre where they resuscitated me and then referred me to one of the best hospitals of India. We took the first flight to Army Research and Referral Hospital New Delhi where the medical officer had one look at my history and said that he suspects thalassemia at play, he ordered a thal profile test and I was diagnosed with B thal major and started on immediate blood transfusions. Later on my parents also underwent the thal profile test and as expected both of them were B thal minors it thalassemia traits. Was rejected over and over when trying to donate blood always for the same reason: low hemoglobin. So I went to a hematologist First, be careful taking iron, we cannot process that sufficiently and it can lead to permanent hepatic iron overload or a ruptured spleen.  I would recommend talking to a genetic counselor and having them run a CBC to analyze results and tell you what is going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was trying to donate my liver and they encountered an elevated level or iron which led me down that path. so you did not find out till you were an adult? oh wow so your elevated level of iron revealed you have thalessmia? formally, yes.  though i always knew that.  My mother had it and worked in the hospital lab.  She told me and i could feel the effects like fatigue, but it was not a formal diagnosis until it was an issue for the donation. Teenager. But yeah, never had any major medical issues as a child so I never had a full blood profile analysis of anything like that, and as I mentioned I am beta minor Me too! I got rejected trying to donate blood due to low hemoglobin and they suggested i tell my doctor about it. I have this same story. Low MCV count within the last year. Sporadically low iron. Been having issues and my doc says thalassemia. I cannot wrap my head around, all of a sudden, I have a genetic blood disorder. Why did it NEVER show up in the 100 blood test I have had over the past 45 years? I have had two kids, donated plasma, had many many blood draws for routine exams... Me too! Diagnosed when I was 30. I came in from bumps on my legs. Derma thought insect bites, then she requested for bloodwork. She then referred me to go to a hematologist and a cardiologist because she suspected something else with my results. \n\nYep. Turns out beta thalassemia minor. Since it went unchecked for 30 years, the clotting problems associated with it went unmanaged. Hence the DVT. And random internal bleeding in my brain and abdomen. Fun ride. I was landing numerous times to urgent care across a year 1/2. Every time they did my CBC they saw abnormally low labs for MCV/MCH/MCHC but for some reason they always ignored it despite it being flagged.\n\nAfter the 7th time seeing it low and getting lower and lower and lower. I told my primary care doctor, \u201cHey I am seeing an abnormal pattern should not we address this?\u201d.\n\nWe did an iron study and it was normal. They sent out my blood to a lab for testing. Turns out I have alpha thalassemia minor. I had chronic sore throats and finally at 14 or 15 my mom took me to check it out. Doctor who I honestly disliked gave me a pamphlet for post nasal drip but being a kid wasnt sure if that was the right thing since it mentioned acid reflux too which I didnt have at the time. He also for whatever reason ordered a blood test. came back with that. He never treated the post nasal drip. \n\nAt 16 my mom took me to an ear nose throat doc, got my tonsils out, figured out my septum was crooked and causing the post nasal drip, offered an in office procedure for it but my mom never took me back.\n\nThank God I only had.minor\n My mom was so inconsistent with my insurances growing up I probably would have died by now if it was more severe but the symptoms seem to be hitting me harder as an adult so I want to check things out again soon.

I was previously diagnosed with \u201cSuggestive of alpha-Thalassemia trait (minor) and also scheduled for AstraZeneca. Would really like to know more on this before I decide to skip the appointment. I know two people with severe headaches since the AZ vaccine.  I would not risk it. Correct me if I am wrong, but SG was only administering Pfizer or Moderna right? My specific concern is pertaining to the usage of AstraZeneca for Thalassemia patients. We have checked with our local practitioner and the advice was to stay away from the AZ vaccine for now if you have any genetical illnesses since long-term side effects have not been thoroughly studied yet.

No issues. Oh true dat. Sorry I have missed out on the important part. I have visited a GP for consultation. I was informed that Thalassemia patients do not have higher risk to TTS as a side-effect of AZ vaccine. Only those with family history of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism have higher risk.\n\nThe GP even said that as an Asian, the risk should be lower for me because these diseases are more prevalent in the Caucasian population.

I find it extremely difficult for me to keep a steady 40 hour work week for more than a year. I have worked in an office setting and in retail, I have been a private swim teacher as well as a swimming coach. I am currently a part-time barista and it is been more manageable for my exhaustion levels. I am wondering what sorts of jobs work well for you all? I climb trees full time and run a business.  Sitting for 40 hours a week in an office setting would kill me.  I would be more exhausted from that. This!! What type of thalassemia do you have? I have alpha thal with Constant Spring and I find even 4 hours on my feet as a hostess in a restaurant exhausting. Before that I had a job where I was working 40 hours on my feet in a kitchen which was also exhausting, and retail that was slower paced and I was not moving as much which I could do better. I actually quit my hostess job last spring right before the lockdown because I wanted to find an office job so I could sit down. I have not been able to get unemployment though because my doctor did not say I should quit so the government did not think my health reasons were good enough without a doctors note. I have no idea what job would be less exhausting other than an office job, but if you are having problems then I do not know I WFH office job and I find it manageable. I have also done 3 days/week part time office job, and that was okay (but WFH I have more energy still). I find 5 days in-office to be intolerable (but I think people without thal feel this way too.) Same, but I cannot even do the 3 days in the office. It was a lot still, for sure. Hoping I can WFH permanently moving forward (after covid). The current job I work is my first full time work from home job. It took me a while to find one but I did. I struggled for a long time because I could not work in an office like \u201cnormal people\u201d and the fact that I was always tired. \n \nI think covid will show people that WFH jobs are real jobs. I hope it works out for you because it is a serious blessing. I work as a Healthcare provider as a Hospital Inpatient Pharmacist, it is a dynamic work and I often have to get up to do my tasks.\n\nI have tried office jobs before, they made me sleepy.\n\nThal Minor here. Resigned a year ago as CFO of a bio pharmaceutical/jewelry/property holdings company. I was working maybe 80 hours a week. Tired, lacking sleep, 5 coffees a day. This was going on for around 4 years. Sent in my resignation and felt like I just had 4 units of blood into my body. Seven years in IT. First year definitely put me into obesity range. Wife dragged me into crossfit and better eating. Even though I finished last most of the time, but I did finish. So if exercise is done at least one hour a day and minimize fat and sugar, added that iron is minimized in our case, we can be normal. Just sucks that it takes more precautions. I have thalassemia, Hashimoto\u2019s, and PCOS so it does not take much for me to be exhausted. Prior to March 2020 I was in the process of working with my doctor to get medical authorization to work remotely. I work 40 hours a week in an office but it was the 2 hours of commuting every day that was completely draining me. Once my office switched to all remote work I was able to keep up again. I can manage the 40 hours at a computer, it was just the additional 10 hours a week commuting that was doing me in.", "Alpha Thalassemia: How fast Ferritin vs Iron levels increase Recently tested and found I have the Alpha Thalassemia trait...so Alpha minor? \n\nIn the past, my iron levels (like from a complete Iron Panel) would show I am in a normal range min the 70s and 80s. However, my Ferritin levels would always be low, usually 6-8. \n\nBefore knowing about thalassemia, this one doctor prescribed Iron pills for anemia, 65mg a day. Took it for maybe no more than a week and a half before I started feeling worse and went in. Got more tests done: Iron was 87, meanwhile my Ferritin jumped up to 31...had not taken any Iron that day yet or night before either. \n\nThis kind of puzzled this other doctor cause according to my labs I was not Iron deficient anymore, and told me to not continue. And this confused me lol, cause I would heard it would take weeks if not months to improve. \n\nIs this experience typical of Alpha Thalassemia, or even Thalassemia in general? There is so many factors including the length of time between tests, what type of iron you were taking, also your labs reference ranges are important as each lab has a different normal based on the calibration of their machine. I took iron and stopped eating dairy and eggs near my iron Alpha Thalassemia Trait means you have 2 alpha hemoglobin genes missing( normally, most people would have a total of 4 genes).\n\nAlpha thalassemia Silent Carrier has one gene missing. \n\nGenerally, trait and silent carriers have no health issues as a result of the missing genes. They do however, have a chance of passing the Trait/thalassemia to their children. If your partner has thalassemia alpha trait (2 or more genes that are missing), then there is a chance of passing the alpha thalassemia disease ( generally 25% chance).\n\nThe most accurate method to know for sure which one you are (a silent or trait) is to do a DNA test. \n\nThere are other indications based on your MCV and MCH that can tell the doctors what you are most likely a trait vs a silent carrier but DNA is generally the most sure method.\n\nFor your case, I think the doctor misdiagnosed you with Iron deficiency which is common for us Alpha Thalassemia carriers. If you do not mind me asking what is your CBC? And have you done a DNA test? I got the electrophoresis test done, evaluation said 'Values consistent with alpha thalassemia trait'. Yea electrophoresis only eliminates the possibility that you have Beta Thal. They generally would do a DNA test after this to determine what alpha thalassemia you have.", "Weird reaction to caffeine Just found this subreddit. I was wondering if anyone has adverse reactions when drinking tea or coffee? I used to drink it all of the time up until about a couple of years ago. I started getting dizzy spells once the caffeine kicked in. I was diagnosed with microcytic anemia due to beta thalassemia minor just a few months ago. Im 28 now.  I read that caffeine can constrict the blood vessels in your brain, making you light headed. So it made sense to me that being anemic would only make it worse. Thoughts? \n\nI would also like to add that I drank a lot of tea because I was constantly fighting fatigue. I now know to avoid it. Both coffee and tea have a bad effect, that is my experience. I am sure there is a reason why it happens due to nutrients and stuff. We have to focus on getting iron and vitamin C. Glad I am not the only one. I have been trying to drink orange juice instead of soda. Other than that I strictly drink water. Thanks for the reply. Try drinking warm water with moringa powder. It helps with the dizzy spells. I will have to look into that. Thank you.", "Post-Covid Ferratin levels?

I am an Alpha minor, but maybe this will give you some insight: \n\nIn 2018 my Ferritin was 17ng/mL. \n\nI believe in 2019 I got COVID...... but the US gvt at that time did not want to do testing so no clue if I actually had it. (Felt sick, would get winded walking 15-25\u2019, slept for three days on the couch because I could not be assed to move).\n\n2019 shows a spike in ferritin to 22ng/mL. \n\nI do not think being Thal has anything to do with the Ferritin thing as there is current research (US Army being one) going on with ferritin nano particles and the COVID19 virus. \n\nA spike in ferritin could indicate inflammation and COVID can cause inflammation.\n\nEdit: I did have elevated CRP, which means I flagged positive for inflammation.", "Thalassemia and Sleep Quality Does anyone find that they have a hard time sleeping/struggle with insomnia due to thalassemia? I only recently have been diagnoses with Thalassemia minor and am curious to see if there is any connection between this condition and sleep.\n\nThanks! I am the contrary, and an acquaintance that I know that has minor too can sleep anywhere anytime. even if it is a crowded noisy area. Same. I am always game for a nap Mm... sleeping is usually okay? Unless I have been drinking.\n\nBut I *have* noticed that if my hemoglobin is low, I am much more likely to wake up to a charlie horse (or two) in my legs. I drink a lot of coffee and end up too anxious to sleep but without coffee I literally cannot perk up at all and could sleep the whole day away and have done so. ^ This is me. Thal Major here. Minor for me but my iron is really low and I think is the biggest culprit for me and my overall health issues and idk what to do about it This is me too I have trouble sleeping at night at a decent hour like 10pm. My usual bedtime is 1am or later and I need at least 10 hours of sleep to feel awake. Otherwise I am so tired and I need a nap which is usually 3 hours long. I talked to a sleep doctor though and they just told me to have better sleep hygiene which I find does not help me. Sometimes I take melatonin supplements to help me fall asleep at night. Yeah my aunt can sleep whenever she was want she is a carrier and me too but I struggle with sleeping me and my mother either so sleeping quality does not related to thalassemia but I think it is related to anemia. Well peculiar case of mine, I am major so strangely when tired I can nap even at a market but when it comes to proper sleep during the night I just cannot sleep.", "Thalassemia Intermedia Hi I am new to this page and I am 19 turning 20 and I have had thal intermedia my whole life.

Does anyone know how much I should be eating and what exercise I should be doing not put to much strain on my body. \n\nThank you guys!!  Based on a personal experience, I would recommend that you go to the gym for at least two days a week. Things like running and core exercises are much more important than weight-lifting. That is for sure besides having a healthy diet that the GP/Dietitian there will tell you about.

From what I can Google it is a little unclear.\n\nJust wondering because I thought I was pretty asymptomatic since my haematologist diagnosed me and said minor is asymptomatic but afterwards there was a period where I had blood tests returned with high levels of ferritin and bilirubin. My ferritin have fluctuated over the years between anemic and high. \n\nThe doctor said I had haemochromatosis but not the condition?\n\nAt the moment my ferritin is fine but doctor said I have really low Vit D.\n\nIve realised Ive always been really tired throughout my life and have trouble feeling alert and there is times of the day where I cannot remember what I was doing for the last few minutes or if I was walking a long distance Ive already reached my destination out of nowhere?

I believe intermedia is diagnosed based on hemoglobin level mostly (could also be from genotype).  Intermedia's Hb usually run around 8 and require occasional transfusions to function.\n\nMost Drs will tell you minor is asymptomatic, but many (if not most) minors would disagree.  \n\n\nI would wonder if ferritin was measured via the same method both times.  The only way to lose iron is by bleeding (or donating blood or chelation therapy).  Once it is high, it will usually stay high unless you bleed it out.  For example, I am still dealing with excess iron given to me as a child even though I am in my 30's now.  Your Hb and other blood levels can and will fluctuate from day to day and depend greatly on your hydration level.  and its normal for bili to be high in thalassemia. Oh really?\nHm well, I had a few minor surgeries over the years mainly to do with my jaw, and quite a few blood tests for appendicitis, cos the doctor did not believe I had it but my mum kept pushing for it to be removed. Finally did have it removed and diagnosed after removal haha. Perhaps that adds up and that would explain why? Otherwise I would not be sure. \n\nThanks for the info :) I have asked multiple doctors over the years, and not a single one has been able to give me a straight answer on the minor vs intermedia debate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome newer medical sources I have read have not mentioned those terms at all, instead preferring transfusion-dependent vs non-transfusion dependent thalassemia?

I (23F) recently got diagnosed with Thalassemia intermedia (I have the trait and symptoms but not as bad as major) I know people usually get diagnosed much earlier. I have always struggled with fatigue since I was young and it has gotten worse over the years I believe. The only reason I got diagnosed was because I had been getting very sick,  very often and my lymph nodes were swollen for a while and my PCP sent me to an oncologist/hematologist who ran tests. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main questions are regarding weight loss. I have lost 30lbs without trying or a change in diet over the course of 4 months. I am now under 100lbs and no one can explain the loss.

Hi there, I am beta thalassemia minor I was also diagnosed in my twenties (26) all my life I was struggling with weight gains and  just like you I can very easy loose weight.

My whole family gets roadsick easily. I always thought its just a coincidence, but then i realise some things that might be connected to my thalassemia. This might be far fetched/ totally wrong but here is what i think... so due to thalassemia i have low haemoglobin, which is what transport oxygen to blood. Then I noticed that when my brothers get sick on the car they tend to want to get some fresh air from outside which makes them feel better. I too, once in a plane got extremely nauseous and they gave me an oxygen mask which from what i can remember did made me feel slightly better. Also, when i get car sick i always yawn excessively and well from google it says that low level of oxygen can induce yawning. In some instances my nausea gets really severe that my leg feels really weak almost like if i just ran a long marathon.

For the past week or so I have been having waves of dizziness and fatigue, so I went to the doctor and they said I had an ear infection and gave me antibiotics and said I should feel better in a day if the infection was the cause. \n\nWell I do not. I have palpitations that contribute to the dizziness and I hate it.  I want to be normal or at least know what is wrong. Did the doctor say anything about the thallesimia? Looks right, IMO. But, I would get a Hemoglobin electrophoresis test done to confirm. If you have no know family history of beta/alpha thal. I would not assume this to be the case. I have beta-thal and do not experience any dizziness/ fatigue. Male with a 12 Hemo. I presume by your reference ranges you are a female. Long story short, follow-up / as it may be a sign of another health concern. What led you to thal? Not that I know of, but they went on vacation and if the results were life threatening they would page her but if not I would have to wait. My RBC has always been on the high side and my hemo has always been low. Other ranges very. My b12 levels are fine and all that. I just hate the way I feel and want to go back to a normal life. \n\nAnd as long as the lab does not see anything life threatening (like that I need treatment with ASAP) I am going to have to wait until my doctor gets back. Your results almost mirror mine and I found out that I have Dominant Beta Thalassemia about 5 years ago via genetic testing. My electrophoresis test was negative and I do not have any \"diagnosed\" family history of Thalassemia. Although a lot of my family members were told that we are chronically anemic. The reason you may have issues with multivitamins could be because of the iron in them. Some people with inherited hemoglobinopathies like Thalassemia are prone to iron overload. This is definitely the case for me. I cannot take iron supplements or infusions or eat iron rich foods/iron fortified foods because it gets into places were it should not (like my organs). That is why some people with Thalassemia have to take iron chelators to get rid of iron out of their body. This is especially true for blood transfusion dependent Thalassemia patients. \n\nMy main Beta Thalassemia symptoms are lightheadedness/dizziness, paleness, anemia, fatigue, leg ulcers (sometimes), headaches, foot pain, shortness of breathe, and elevated heart rate. \n\nHopefully you get referred to a good hematologist after your test results get evaluated. My Hematologist sucks and does not even understand the basics about hemoglobinopathies. He keeps asking me (the patient), why are your red blood cells so small? Why do they vary in size? Then he tries to prescribe me iron supplements even though my ferritin serum levels are always normal \ud83e\udd26. I just nod my head and make sure I supplement with methylated folate. Does shortness of breath include getting a wave of dizziness causing you to take in air? Cause that sometimes happen, I would get this wave of dizziness and then breathe in air like my body automatically does it? It is weird. \n\nMy doctor said if it was the ear infection causing it I would get better. But I am not. It is not so simple. You could have high RBC and low hemo from other illnesses. If it was this simple, high RBC + low hemo = thal. than the other testing would not be important. Most people with thal are not \"wanting to go back to normal life.\" (unless one has thal major, which you do not.) I would keep digging around. First investigate thal and then see if there are other issues, as well. Though, you are right to take it serious. Best of luck on your search. &gt;My electrophoresis test was negative and I do not have any \"diagnosed\" family history of Thalassemia. \n\nThat is odd that your electrophoresis was negative. Though, good call on the the iron concerns. Iron is the go-to for most anemic situations, which is the opposite of what many beta thal. people need. If it was not for my genetic testing, I would not have ever found out that I had Beta Thalassemia or G6PD Deficiency. The Beta Thalassemia that I have is rare and cannot be diagnosed via electrophoresis. G6PD Deficiency in females is difficult to diagnose using blood tests because it is x linked and x-inactivation in women can yield false negative test results. Again, my family members and I were always told that we are chronically anemic and our doctors assumed it was iron deficiency anemia and would prescribe us iron (which in turn, was making us sicker and more anemic). Our anemia is due to folic acid deficiency, as is the case for most people with genetic blood disorders and hemoglobinopathies whose ferritin serum levels are normal. Shortness of breathe meaning struggling to breath. My breaths would become short and rapid. Upon standing I would become lightheaded and dizzy. Sometimes I fall because of it. My lips often turns blue too. I have only had one ear infection in my life so I know that is not the reason (in my case). And my doctors have ruled out vertigo and POTS as possible causes. However, when I am in hemolytic crisis, I do struggle with hypoglycemia and it can cause dizziness. Do you have your iron labs? That is needed first before electrophoresis. You need iron labs to rule out iron deficiency anemia (IDA), which may be the cause and may also coexist with thalassemia. Although you have an elevated RBC count which favors thalassemia (it is decreased usually with IDA). And IDA would not usually cause your MCV to be that low until your hemoglobin drops to 10 or less. \n\nEither way, you need iron labs and hemoglobin electrophoresis. If the electrophoresis is normal you would likely have alpha-thalassemia minor. If it shows elevations in \u201chemoglobin A2\u201d then beta-thalassemia minor. \n\nToo much info. But follow up with your doc. \u2014current med student with alpha thalassemia.", "Is being a carrier of thalassemia the same as having thalassemia minor? I am so confused about how the inheritance patterns work for this disorder. Yes. yup, i think that minor, trait, and carrier are all the same.  \n\nI will not pretend to be an expert and might be wrong but i think that the inheritance chances for a child are 50% if parent is a carrier, and if both parents are a carrier there is a 50% chance of having major (which is kind of a big deal) i rmbr reading it as 25% for thalassemia minor. think of it this way: if u have thalassemia minor, that means u have 1 \"thalassemia positive\" chromosome (from ur parent that has thalassemia minor) &amp; one \"normal\" chromosome (from the other parent who does not). assuming ur partner does not have thalassemia, that means they have 2 \"normal\" chromosomes. therefore, each child has a 25% chance of having thalassemia minor. My daughter has thalassemia trait and sickle cell trait, according to her 23andMe. She inherited the sickle cell trait from her dad. But on my 23andMe, it does not show thalassemia. I have been told she could have inherited it from him along with the sickle cell trait. It is wild, because I did not think that was possible. I thought you had to inherit one trait from each parent. This would mean she has sickle-beta thalassemia from what I have read. She does have to have iron infusions sometimes and she deals with other issues that seem to be related to sickle beta thal. It is very confusing and very difficult to find a doctor who really knows what they are talking about. So if you are a carrier, does that mean you can have symptoms or you just \u201ccarry\u201d it and are absolutely not affected by it yourself? \nMy doctor suspects that I might have thalassemia minor or iron deficiency anemia. My hemoglobin and MCV are low, but my RBC is normal and my RBW is high. My ferritin is low. We are testing my iron and hemoglobin electrophoresis soon. My mom has healthy blood, not sure about my dad, but he is never had any problems. I can say with confidence either one do not have major. im not too sure abt rbc, mcv, and stuff so i cant say you have it or not but i think will thalassemia its pretty common for hemoglobin to not go over a certain level (like 10). i will say my dad has thalassemia minor and he is very active and does not seem to have any symptoms. on the other hand, i also have it and i have fatigue. im pretty sure anyone who has the gene for it technically has it, but the symptoms range from person to person", "Anemia VS Thalassemia Minor I know its different but how much different is it? How much will yoga exercises help us?", "I am a 16 year old Beta thallesemia major. Hi, I just found this sub and wanted to share my story. I am a 16 year old beta thallesemia major. I used to have blood transfusions every 14 days, but now I am on a combination of meds primarily including Hydroxyurea and thalidomide. It is been 5 years since my last transfusion. My Haemoglobin is stable at 11 gm.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have thallesemia, keep courage and be strong. You are normal like everyone else. Even if you are on transfusions, remember that you are very lucky to get this life.\n\n\nAlso, I want to know how Sars-Cov-2 affects us thallesemics if anyone has some credible info. There is not much about it on the internet I know! I am a biochemistry major working in research and I BELIEVE that it will affect us more (possibly), especially if we have already low hemoglobin levels. It is mixed however. From my understanding, Corona takes hemoglobin and kicks out the iron, forming a porphyrin, which is needed for virus survival. In that case, we would be \u201cgood\u201d because less hemoglobin means less virus accumulation. BUT doctors have noticed decreased Hb after Corona and increased iron accumulation. The low Hb can cause lung failure, so be careful. \n\nLink( Hey! I am a beta thal intermedia. I also started hydroxyurea last year for a few months but did not continue because I did not feel like it had much of an effect on me. Although, I was not very consistent with taking it. \n\nHow do you feel like it has affected you, if at all? Has it been helpful?\n\nEdit: Wanted to also say thanks for your post. And I do not know how COVID-19 will affect us, so I cannot help much there unfortunately. Hi,\n\nTaking hydroxyurea has in a way significantly changed my life. I am now completely off of blood transfusions, which I earlier needed every 2 weeks. I am also growing properly and having much more energy on average. So I would say overall it has affected me positively.\n\nSorry for the late reply! This is fascinating and scary at the same time. Thanks for the info. Wow. That is awesome! Happy to hear that it had such a substantial &amp; positive effect on you. Makes me consider trying it again haha", "General advice for improving your conditions with thalassemia I see it over and over again that folks with thalassemia minor post on this subreddit asking for advice for improving their condition. One important note here is that thalassemia is a genetic condition and there is not much that doctors can do about it. Unless your hemoglobin is too low for red blood cell infusions, which is rare for thal minors.  What can help you most is improving your diet, taking supplements and working out. \n\nThere are already  some great articles and posts on how to do this. I created this post so that people do not have to ask over and over again and I ask the moderators to make it a sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(\n\n(\n\nThese two articles contain a lot of information to help you feel better. Read them and implement their advice.\n\nHere is my personal advice: Do not take iron supplements unless your blood works show low iron levels. Even if a doctor prescribes you iron, ask for a blood work first as primary care physicians usually do not know much about thal. Both my iron and ferritin levels were at top of the normal range. If you are not vegetarian try to have beef often (I have it almost everyday) as it contains all the nutrients you need for making new red blood cells. Beef liver is a great source of nutrients too but be aware that it contains lots of vitamin A. (Which means you should not eat it everyday.)\n\nImportant to know that it is not just about food and supplements. When you do cardio workout or even just walk, your body produces more red blood cells. Try to walk a few miles everyday. Cardio may seem too difficult at first, and so did for me, but with persistence you will get good at it. I myself aim at 30 minutes of cardio (running or biking) 5 days a week and I take long walks everyday. \n\nWe are all frustrated when doctors tell us \"thal minor is asymptomatic\" but I am starting to think they may have a point. I mean you may have a concurrent condition that contributes to your fatigue and if so you need to address that first. For example I myself have insomnia which is apparently caused by anxiety and is likely to contribute to my fatigue more than thalassemia. \n\nFeel free to add other sources of useful information in the comments. This is super helpful thank you for sharing", "Can this be thalassemia? Blood results. The names are in italian, but i think it is understandable. I think it also can be an iron deficiency, but would like to know your opinions before my appointment (i have to wait some weeks) possible thal minor and if you are Italian would def not be surprising. Is one of these hemoglobin or do you have that number? The third one is hemoglobin. \n\nAnyway hairloss can be a symptom of thalassemia? Have you had your thyroid checked? Mmh yes, only tsh and it is 1,40 You are right on the lower end. Doctors would say you are fine but if you are a male you should not be nowhere under 14.5 so I say yeah you do have minor thal damn..\n\nshould i worry? how do i deal with this?\n\nIron supplements is a good idea?\n\nThis means i am anemic too right? Calm down, I am not a doctor. Talk to your doctor first and point to him that your hemo should not be that low. If he confirms that you have minor thal come back here", "Possible Thalassemia I have been told by the doctor that i posisbly have this condition as my MCV has come back at 60 during a couple of blood tests recently. \n\nIs 60 quite low for a 31M?\n\nIf so, it would probably explain alot of things in my past\n\nThank you That sounds low. Mine is 81, and I am a female. There could be other reasons for low volume though. Thanks for your reply. Do you think there could be any symptoms relating to a low mcv rating such as mine? Thanks There are an array of symptoms. Low blood pressure, fainting, fatigue, dizziness just to make a few. Have you experienced any of these? I think the normal range is 80-99, so that looks low. Normally the normal range appears alongside the test results in the lab reports. \n\nI have now learnt to keep a copy of my blood tests for myself so I can track them and see if interventions make a difference.

And if there are anyways to increase these levels even with the condition? \n\nSorry it is alot for me to process as i have only been told i could possibly have this condition. I have had the hemoglobin tests today so i will know a definate answer early next week. I am just constantly fatigued but reading along the lines beta's are supposed to be asymptomatic? Thanks for the reply. Yes im constantly fatigued and struggle to put any weight on, due to sickness i have lost 8kgs in 4 weeks. Is Beta supposed to be asymptomatic? They say beta is more asymptomatic but three family members of mine have it and have similar symptoms. Other than the tiredness etc I do not notice any other effects on my life :) folate and vitamin b 12 supplements are said to help. Also check your ferritin levels, you can have iron deficiency and thalassemia (if that is the case you take an iron supplement) but if you do not have low iron make sure you do not supplement it as that can cause more problems :) Late reply, but you might want to consider getting a genetic test. That will give you a definitive answer. It is too easy to speculate based on family history, MVC values, etc, but a genetic test will give you a definitive yes/no.\n\nBeta minora is not so much \"asymptomatic\" as it is \"aclinical\". That is, you can get along fine through life without medical treatment, but the symptoms still affect you. It is just that most people find the symptoms easy to manage.

Please give any info you guys have I am very intrigued. I am a biochemist and have done genetic alterations on other things (plants). I do not think medical advice is allowed on this sub, but I would be happy to answer general questions (if the mods allow). \n\nI do not specialize in gene therapy, but I have read the academic papers and understand why it works. It is of personal interest to me for all the obvious reasons. \n\nThere are some fundamental ethical issues that need to be addressed. Such as \"what are the moral implications of being able to modify your own genome. Where does that path lead?\"\n\nI think everyone is excited for the new gene therapies. We might see a total cure for thal in our lifetimes!

Need advice on exact NAMES of testing to ask for lab work. Hey guys! So I was told my whole life I had Thalassemia beta minor trait (my father and siblings subsequently when deciding on having kids had the test done) but I never tested it. \n\nMy blood work always came normal or when it showed anemic state they would say it is cause of the trait. I have never been nutritionally deficient, in Canada we are at risk for Vitamin D so it is been years I supplement 1000u and this Winter I went to like 2000u and I try and just take in the sun even if it is for a few minutes all year round. \n\nFast forward now covid, I neglected and put off my annual check ups putting me at almost 2 year of blood work not done. Early Winter in like November I started getting an ingrown at the same spot I kept getting it all year. I never shave my beard and never have I frowns but I started clean shaving and trying to fix it. Fast forward I lost my shit and just started picking out the hair myself until I created a missing patch. I figured I just derooted the hairs but now we are almost 4 months in and while the hair is growing up just a bit it is still there. \n\nI end up realizing it is Alopecia likely (unconfirmed in terms of biopsy) but it makes sense. So an auto immune disorder where in normal AID fashion healthy cells attack other healthy cells (thus the hair loss). \n\nI notice a few people around me all have this and out of nowhere. This week I start really digging into it because my Dad had his third neurological episode of Transient Global/Epileptic Amnesia so I cracked out the books, took a friend university logins and started getting to work. Eventually my analysis and prognosis brought\nMe to attack his Thalassemia trait and see how or what if it is playing a role in this VERY RARE neurological disorder that shows 0 damage post episode and doctors have no idea what or why causes it since the amnesia lasts less than an hour. \n\nAs I start researching Thalassemia using trend analysis and data scraping, I start noticing how Alopecia, Thalassemia, Iron deficiency, sickle cell, iron deficiency hair loss, hair loss anemia, etc. Are all keywords that are either currently at their 100% max value over the history Google has been tracking search volume, and some of the nicher terms are at 5,000-10,000% increase in the last 12 months. \n\nNow I have a pretty big network, where I am from in Canada, my city must have something like 80% immigrant composition at this point (Greek, Italian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Syrian, Iranian, Turkish, Indian) etc. If you search \u201cThalassemia\u201d by news these are the countries that pop up in terms of new science articles new research new measures etc etc. Obvious the concern is known by the country and government. \n\nNow in Canada, USA, Australia who have highly and densely populated amounts of these generational immigrants, not so much. (City with most Greeks apart from Athens is Melbourne right, 1.5M Greeks in like NYC or something etc. \n\nSo a lot of these kids and their kids do not even really know that having the trait or what the trait really is. I am fortunate to know because my Dad knew and he comes from the Southern Island parts of Greece which has high Thalassemia carriers including Cyprus and such. \n\nSo I get to sampling. I ask how many people (males) have had sudden out of nowhere acute hair loss / patchiness on beard / scalp. I have been able to identify 100 cases so far including individuals who told me about others in their family or circles. From those 100 cases at least 50% have known and confirmed Thalassemia trait carriers / OR have always struggled with iron deficiency and anemia diagnosis and prognosis that never really cures itself (well no shit Doctors if you cannot correct someone is iron deficiency after so long maybe it should be in the system to prompt you to have them test for Thalassemia / sickle cell?). \n\nFrom the others who do not know, they show all the similar patterns of someone who could be iron deficient (pale and yellowish / light pink whiteish under eye lids vs. they always knew that area to be bloodshot red - so they are recognizing they are deficient) which explains the Alopecia and the autoimmune disorder (for which they have just been too embarrassed to bring it up or talk about it because they associated it the hair loss to stress and did not bother checking). \n\n\u2014&gt; sudden cold extremities onset of the last 12 months (cold feet and toes and hands and fingers). A lot of girls brought this up and told me they sleep with socks for the first time ever (so do I this year I just did not think much of it it was a natural reaction to the circumstance). \n\n\u2014&gt; chronic acute dry cough with no explanation (sure some of us smoke(d) but there comes a time where a smoker who has had smoker cough their whole life or bronchitis or chronic bronchitis etc. KNOWS the difference between coughs). This cough is what I like to call a \u201cheart cough\u201d cause when it hits me it is as if it just jolts my heart and I like *feel* the arterial or venous circulation that happens like lack of oxygen response \n\n\u2014&gt; eyelid color being pale and far from bloodshot red which would be symbolic to when we were kids and making funny faces to people \n\n\u2014&gt; strange tastes in mouth / maybe metallic or not not even sure \n\n\u2014&gt; EXTREME inexplicable fatigue.. despite proper nutrient rich diets and physical activity (exercise in every case people say cardiovascular stamina has decreased and they get out of breath quicker and stuff which they cannot explain since they do not smoke and they were just as active before the lockdowns and pandemic) \n\n\u2014&gt; part of coughing / nose : blood in mucus and phlegm or in nasal mucus so blowing out bloody \n\n\u2014&gt; left arm pains in all the arterial and veinous areas which indicate the blood flow / heart relationship\n\n\u2014&gt; for those who enjoy stimulants or are prescribed for ADHD, adderall no longer helping offset the fatigue or lack of motivation / but the body craving it if they go a few days without it or when their script ends (I noticed this for myself as well). So because \u201cdependency\u201d and addiction is a thing with stimulants we always jump right into that part but I know my body better than anyone and it is as if the adderall and my increase in black coffees (I used to only have one in the morning maybe one in the evening now I added a third one on occasion in a 24 hour period) is like my body \u201ccrying for help\u201d \u201clonging for the effect\u201d that the stimulants provide to my nervous system and circulation. It is as if it somehow offsets and negative anemic effects I have not noticed thus why I am craving it. But at the same time it does not help with the fatigue in any way. I can fall and crash and nap any time of the day just like I can go on an all nighter lately it is weird. \n\n\u2014&gt; no one has had covid complications or symptomatic covid cases. Many of us when travelling did testing and found either the presence of antibodies (which of course is not an official test but the private clinics do it) or they appeared as asymptomatic carriers when they had to do a test because someone they work with or their primary household got sick \n\nNow the interesting stuff beyond the correlation of random and acute presence of anemia effects / iron deficiency after all these years + in men the Alopecia (I am not sure what I could find among women just yet that could be a similar phenomenon happening, women shave and do laser and for the most part do not have beard hair like men unless they have adrenal gland disorders but then we are getting into hormones)\n\n** some of the individuals with the Alopecia saw doctors who said oh yeah your hormones are off it is stress here take cortisone, and not ONE of them has seen any development or improvement with the cortisone (doctors need to start giving out more thorough lab chemistry panel testing because a hormone panel test would easily show you the individual was not necessarily cortisol or aldosterone deficient) **\n\nWHAT AM I GETTING AT?\n\n\u2014&gt; if Thalassemia was our body\u2019s response to a malaria epidemic 2000 years ago and the gene mutated in a way (I know nothing about the real mechanics of genes and immunology and virology and all that of course) where if infected with malaria the body rejected it because it appeared to be doing other stuff or handling another threat of whatnot right.. that is why it is hypothesized we possess malaria immunity\n\n\u2014&gt; then what if now that covid SARS-COV-2 is in the air and our environment what if the virus tried to infect us but then we woke up this 2000 year old DNA and the trait went back to \u201cacting\u201d up vs. Being \u201cdormant\u201d and is amusing itself with finding non lethal or dangerous ways of \u201cmasking\u201d itself to \u201cfool\u201d this more serious threat aka the Alopecia in men with the trait and chronic fatigue \n\n\u2014&gt; how is everyone who had quiet beta minor all of a sudden dealing with actual iron deficiency more than usual? (Proof this sub alone I scanned as many posts to get the general current sentiment)\n\n\u2014&gt; the last time these correlations were present in terms of search volume was 03-04 during SARS\n\n\u2014&gt; sickle cell / anemia / hematologic diseases and complications are trending 5000% higher etc etc. \n\n\u2014&gt; people in Alopecia forums have said they have never seen such an increase in cases and interest in information \n\n\u2014&gt; a lot of people who claim the shortness of breath feelings upon further probing a lot of them explain it is more of a \u201cI hold my breath subconsciously\u201d type of thing which forces a breath to be taken naturally\n\n** I am 100000% aware that causation does not = correlation and I understand entirely the theories of logical fallacies such as confirmation bias **\n\nIf you read this far thank you and I do not expect us to get any answers in terms of epidemiology and the genetic nature biogenetic researchers unless they are studying this trait and happen to find this post but I want to know\n\n(1) from anything I said I know we can attribute a lot of symptoms and feelings to a wide variety of things but think about the hair loss the sudden increase in fatigue ACUTELY to 2020-21 the cold extremities etc. Does any of this ring a bell or make sense? (In my post in Alopecia subreddit a lady responded her son has the trait actually and she is been looking to see what is been happening or whatever with the hair loss)\n\n(2) I am going to go run lab work later today or tomorrow. What do I ask for? I want not only a CBC I want the best test to check the trait + anemia + iron deficiency and other nutrient deficiency/ complete metabolic panel? Electrolyte panel? And the most detailed CBC hemaglobin breakdown. \n\nThank you! I may have found my answer in terms of the research towards immunity:\n\n\n\nSo *evidence* in early trials show immunization among beta Thalassemia towards SARS-cov-2 and suggests \u201cheme attack on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin beta-chain synthethis ... \u201c\n\nNow I need to keep digging or better understand what would this mean in regards to what else can flare up or relationship to the Alopecia Idk, this is strange to me, because thalassemia is not a dormant trait that is awakened. It is the blueprint your body uses to make a blood cell. If you have thalassemia, you are missing information required to tell your body how a blood cell is fully formed. It is not a disease that is awakened. It is a missing code. Your body cannot produce blood normally then suddenly be like \"oh I do not know how to do that anymore\". With thalassemia, it never knew.\n\nSome people on here seem to say that stress affects their thalassemia though, but I believe in that case, it worsens it rather than activates it. The pandemic causes stress to people. That would certainly worsen all sorts of conditions. I definitely agree but psychosomatic symptoms aside, we can technically quantify and measure \u201cstress\u201d and benchmark it against the right parameters (cortisol, aldosterone, epinephrine, vasopressin, etc. aka adrenal gland / pituitary gland disorders or just general functioning). \n\nSo if you had trait minor, in the past you appeared anemic on paper during a CBC, but you knew it was trait-related, what would happen where you now ARE iron deficient \u2014&gt; and all the issues that come with that and anemia? \n\nHow does the trait minor respond when you are anemic? I have definitely seen numbers/explanations of what labs look like if you have thal minor vs iron deficiency or both on thalpal.com before. I looked and did not see the post stickied. But my advice would be if no one here knows, you can ask there. Thank you will check it out !! You would need to get an iron panel to tell.  The symptoms of iron deficient anemia and thalassemia anemia are near identical. (and both are anemia)  A test like this: ( would help you understand if you are now iron deficient. Do you have confirmed thal though? Theyre told me that since I am a kid but I am going tomorrow to do full tests for iron FBC and the genetic for thal to confirm Got it, it should be a no brainer based on previous results. No disrespect, but I am skeptical that beta can flare up as you have described. i know it is disheartening not to know the answers to health related problems though. Oh I am not worried about having the trait or not officially.. I am curious as to what the relationship is with Alopecia and covid lol which is fascinating although my sample contains massive bias it is still puzzling that so many people with either Thalassemia or runs in the family that now present signs of Alopecia and patchy hair loss all of a sudden Is it possible that the general hair loss (not necessarily alopecia thought) could be a result of low iron anemia? I usually have to request full blood panel testing to find out if I am *actually* iron deficent vs Thal presenting tests, and most recently when I was very low I was loosing a lot of hair until I got my iron up. Apologies, just rambling at this point lol No that is totally my thinking (I am going this afternoon). Low iron deficiency hair loss is the common reason for Alopecia flare ups apparently. \n\nThe thing I am trying to understand is if there would be a relationship between non transfusion dependent Thalassemia cases (so just dormant beta minor trait) and all of a sudden iron deficiency? With covid being the stable parameter. \n\nBeta minor trait carrier \u2014&gt; gets covid \u2014&gt; trait responds by depleting iron creating iron deficient anemia (which then can produce the alopecia or extreme sudden fatigue etc. )\n\nI find it hard to believe so many people with positive beta minor all of a sudden became iron deficient especially city in from (Montreal) is #1-2 per capita lol or something for infections and deaths basically at this point we all know people who either had it, had it bad, or know extended individuals who have died from it. \n\nNow ironically the AstraZenica vaccine is getting bad because it is creating HEMATOLOGIC issues among EUROPEANS that they cannot explain.. the Dutch lady who died from it had a \u201cweird case of low platelets and clots\u201d (beta minor carriers are susceptible to blood clots right)\n\nI am just saying lol something is up Is there record of a group of people becoming iron deficient suddenly? I personally do not think I have even ever met another person with Thalassemia, however iron deficiency can be the result of so many different factors. I just had a low test result (lower the usual) but it had nothing to do with Covid, or Thal Thank you! Going later this afternoon going to ask the Dr. to review the panel in the link to ensure we do full iron panel and FBC I think a lot of people who are suddenly at home and sedentary are probably making worse choices than they might normally in regards to food and thus might be experiencing some vitamin deficiencies as a result, so possible flare ups could just be because most people unless a doctor has told them to do so, do not actually keep track that well of what their vitamin intake is (and even those who should still pretty much do not keep huge track of it if they do not notice a difference in their health). I do not know if there is a record or anything of it but it makes sense to me that with huge changes in activity for a portion of people even in the US alone that some might notice they are suddenly iron deficient or something else, especially women since we have bigger issues with iron to begin with due to menstruation. \n\nI know my thal seems to be affecting me worse since covid so if stress is a factor for us at least the pandemic makes sense as a factor for that too. I have not had this much trouble staying awake in years (Not even when I was smoking weed daily haha) My doctor told me that I was born with thalessmia and it was activated through another medical condition. I have also heard of others being asymptomatic until a certain age. You can be asymptomatic. But it is not activated. It can be worsened by things like nutritional deficiency.", "Anyone get really bad hangovers? I am B thal minor and my hangovers are the absolute worse.

Apparently it is normal to get tiny white patches on your gums if you are anemic or have thalassemia. I am worried that the patches are pre-cancerous but if any of you have experienced it as well it would be nice to know/\n\nAlso, I have thalassemia minor.", "Latvian Tiny Girl BloundiDoli In Great Sofa Show ", "Anybody else into low carb diet (Keto, Zerocarb, Paleo)? So happy that this group exists. I have Thalassemia minor. In the past, i have tried doing keto, and zerocarb (carnivore, all meat) and had tremendous success with it on weightloss. I pretty much lived normally. Although, not sure if doing it long term is a good idea since that diet high in  red meat probably  has a lot of iron.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nSo, I was diagnosed with Thalassemia Minor sort of by accident at around age 23 (i am 29 now) during an employment medical exam. Was asked to do bloodwork twice and that I appear to have anemia, which i found weird because i was feeling totally normal. In order to be cleared and fit to work, I was asked to consult a Hematologist and was recommended to do 2 tests to verify the suspected Thalassemia. I was only able to do one, the Ferritin test to rule out iron deficiency as the cause. Since i cannot afford to do the 2nd  more expensive test  (I think it was called Electrophoresis), I do not have any more specific details as to what specific kind I have, if it is alpha or beta. Note that our healthcare system is bad so tests can get really expensive. I found myself getting dizzy on keto but I might not have been eating varied enough. I have a lot of trigger foods right now though so I have just started taking vitamins (found one without iron) and seems to be helping. \n\nKeto is not supposed to be long term overall though. How long did you try it? And what type of thal do you have? I am alpha thalassemia minor and is doing keto and intermittent fasting. The plan is to continue this for good.\n\nStarting was hard but it is going good. I exercise better now than before and have much less fatigue, better sleep and better concentration. Blood sugar is stable even though I do consume low carbs. Sometimes I sneak in some oatmeal but my blood sugar remains stable.\n\nShort term, keto will not help much since it is more about becoming fat adapted than being in ketosis. It could take up to 6 or 8 or more months to become fat adapted. But it is worth it.\n\nKeto is worth it but not easy to get right. I think everyone is different and will experience different challenges. You might fail first few times, you have to keep tweaking it as you go along.\n\nBut let us get back to the question: how to avoid the iron on Keto.\n\nSlow the absorption:\n\n- Either reduce iron rich protein (Beef, Liver, ..) or Drink Tea, Herbal Tee or Coffee after eating them.\n\nThe polyphenols in Tee hinders iron absorption.\n\nYou can also rely on other non-iron rich proteins.\n\nAnyways you should really have Tea with thalassemia.\n\n- Consume lots of Vitamin C (Lemon for example) but on an empty stomach or with Tea.\n\nVitamin C enhances iron absorption.\n\n- For vegetables, the iron is not easily absorbed but if you find that it is for you, then consume Tea after. \n\nNote that too much fiber in veggies can cause gas ...\n\nI was afraid I could not do Keto because of thalassemia and had the same question. But I believe it is possible.\n\nHope this helps. If you need more info about  my experiences so far, then please let me know.\n\nPlease not all of this is my personal experience and has to be applied to you in your context.\n\nGood luck!  Im already experienced doing both keto and carnivore and i find myself leaning towards somewhere in between, a sort of meat heavy keto. That said, after reading through this sub, got scared because of the possible iron over accumulation.\n\nI did'nt know that about Tea and Vitamin C! \ud83d\ude33. Thanks for that\n\nI think the best way is to be on it a month or two then do bloodwork to see how my body does with iron. Been able to be on it for approx 6 to 8 months in the past year. You are welcome! \n\nYour fear is completely justified. I hope it goes well. \n\nCheers! Btw, Why do you recommend still getting vit c if it increases iron absorption? Generally vit c is so important for collagen and immune system and since it is water soluble we can get away with taking so much of it and we should.\n\nHowever since it enhances iron absorption, a person with thalassemia should avoid it in combo with other foods esp if those are iron rich.\n\nThis is why I recommend vit c on an empty stomach like an 1hr before or 2 hrs after a meal or combined it with tea. If you combine it with tea, make sure the tea is not too hot as heat damages vit c.\n\nMost people take lemon first thing in the morning. Got it. Thanks, i appreciate it!", "What is Thalassemia?

I am always cold and way colder than anyone else at all times, have been my whole life. I think that some people are just different in that way, not sure it has anything to do with thal...?

I was confused because I was not ever taking iron supplements for it until this visit, so the last time I visited it makes no sense that I suddenly was not anemic.\nShe got me a ton of blood work done. \n\nShe told me I might have an autoimmune disorder because I got a positive ANA test, but then told me I have thalassemia and to not even worry about it. \n\nI looked at the results she sent me and it says my results are consistent with alpha thalassemia TRAIT, which now I see in her message is what she said to me too. \n\nI do not understand because I do have the symptoms of fatigue, when I lift my head up I feel like I am going to pass out and my eyes go white, chronic pain and headaches etc. \nCan just having the trait mean your blood cells are smaller and weaker too, or do you have to have minor/major? The test showed my hemoglobin levels and everything else were normal apparently, but they never are which is why I am always thought to be anemic. But this test was taken after 3 months of me taking ferrous sulfate (iron), l-methyfolate, vitamin D, and b12. Could it be because of the other vitamins and not the iron itself?\n\nAnd could the pain and fatigue be because of an auto immune disorder? I had an apparently low titer of 1:80. But in 2017 I was checked for fibromyalgia and had a negative ANA test, I have recently learned you cannot check for fibromyalgia and can only rule other things *out*, but it was the first test I did and my pcp (that I was complaining about) immediately wrote down that I had fibromyalgia and that he started me on pills. (He never did.) \n\nSo could that be why I am experiencing the symptoms? Fibromyalgia possibly or something else? Because I have had these symptoms as long as I can remember, and I find it weird that a titer of 1:80 can mean you are either at the beginning of an auto immune disorder, or that you are healthy, yet I have always had these issues. Testing also showed I was exposed to either mono or ebv before. So I am confused, if the alpha trait does not give you the symptoms, do I just have an auto immune disorder? \n\nAnd my biggest point, she told me to stop taking iron and I did but it is worrying me. At the time of my first COVID vaccinations I was not being treated for what I thought was anemia. Then I learned if you are anemic and do not take iron, the vaccine will not work as well. Then a few months later I started taking the meds. Now I am getting my booster this month and off of iron again, and I am worried this is some sort of mistake, and that I am yet again going to take my vaccinate without being as healthy as I can, in turn, not making it work as well. \n\nSorry this was a lot, I am so confused and I am very worried about getting COVID, I do not want to be hospitalized or die of course.", "Doctor said she noticed my blood cells look small, thoughts?

I have obviously had this all my life, and the diagnosis made a lot of sense with some of the struggles I have had in life. I used to be able to manage to keep up with an active lifestyle, despite obvious struggles with cardio and other joys due to dyspraxia! I began struggling more with daily issues with my energy levels, light-headedness, brain fog , occasional nausea and generally feeling unwell during my late 20s. \n\nI have been working a 40 hr week cleaning job for the last 9 years, and the last 4 or so years have been a real struggle. This job was only taken as one to get me by after I graduated university and struggled to find an entry level position. I have been trying my hardest to find a new job, and keep ontop of/learning new skill sets; but find I lack the energy at the end of the day and struggle to do everything I need to do due to being physically and socially exhausted. I know my job plays the major issue here, but when I have finally been able to land interviews, I am in a sub-human state and struggle to let myself shine due to exhaustion and brain fog \n\nI have also been struggling at home. I live by myself and have been just about managing to keep up with clean, healthy eating; but struggle to maintain my house cleanliness (I at least keep the kitchen clean and bathroom acceptable as food hygiene is very important). I feel disgusted with myself for how I live, even though I know I am doing my best \n\nI just feel really trapped. I am an INTJ too, so desire to learn and achieve, and reach my goals is strong. As much as I logistically know I am trying my best and am  being too hard on myself, and know what I need to do to improve my quality of life; achieving this is really difficult. This has become even harder with COVID-19 as my goals feel so much further out of reach, and a few milestones I did finally be able to fight a and achieve have been killed outside of my own control. I have been fed up of feeling like I am simply existing for a long time, and want to finally feel like I am living. I can relate as I have thal minor, but I have known since I was a teen. And I am intj too :) I have worked so hard aiming for a great career, that I did not always take care of myself. Do you take vitamins? They help me keep my energy up, a multivitamin is good as well as a vitamin b complex. I also take vitamin d since I have very low vit d.

I now realize (for me) I should not be so adamant about putting my all just for work..it is just as important to put your all in your health. Your older self will thank you :) Same.

I can sometimes be complacent in taking them though. I try to take them just after dinner and have a pill organiser but can be so cloudy with remembering the things in the evenings!\n\nI do wish I got diagnosed when I was younger. I am half-Greek but not in contact with my Greek family. When I got my diagnosis my (English) mum said that she knew it was prevalent there (she lived out there for a few years); but never thought about getting me tested or even that I would have it (I was born and have lived in the UK all my life). My dad must have been a carrier but either never knew he had it, or never said. She does not really know too much about genetics though, but seemed a bit guilty about never noticing anything was up, even though none of that is her fault.

Do you know if you have minor/are a carrier or have not inherited thal at all? Have you been blood tested? I am unsure but I know that all my life I have had problems with anemia so I could have minor thal but I know I am definitely a carrier If you know you are a carrier that means you have thal minor. Also be careful that doctors do not misdiagnose you as having iron deficiency as thal can look very similar in blood work if tests are not done specifically for iron levels.\n\nBut basically if both your parents have thal minor, I believe you have a 50% chance of having thal minor, a 25% chance of thal major, and a 25% chance of normal blood.\n\nIf you have a child with a normal partner and you have thal minor, you have a 25% chance your child has thal minor and a 75% chance of a normal baby.\n\nThese percentages are generally speaking.\n\nThal major is life threatening and requires regular blood transfusions etc. Thal minor involves anemia like symptoms such as fatigue. If you a child with a normal partener and you are a carrier (thal minor) you have 50 % chance ta have acrrier also 50 % to have a normal child . It the same chance because we inherited 50 % from each parent and the parent got 100 % so the carrier wil got 50 % sick part and 50 % normal part do the child will take one its not 75 % its 50 % You are correct, I double checked ", "Thalassemia and Smoking Can smoking/vaping lead to severe deterioration of health, if you have Thalassemia? Kind Of worried, I suspect I might have this and I have been smoking since I was 18. No major symptoms, but I do feel legathric quite often, but that could just because I am a lazy fuck. Also one of my parents have been diagnosed with Thalassemia. As a thalassemic, if I am not stimulated by caffeine, I feel lethargic anyways. Sometimes even caffeine is not enough. I recommend speaking to a doctor about it, though what they are likely to recommend is to quit smoking anyways, cause long-term consequences outweigh the short-term pleasures and blah-blah. \n\nIf you are concerned about wanting to live a long life with higher quality of function, then all I can suggest is try quitting smoking and look for alternatives as well.

Yes, smoking actually has a huge impact on your vascular system and damaging/hardening the walls of your vessels. It impairs oxygen delivery and for people who already have reduced carrying capacity, as in Thalassemia, the poor delivery can make you really tired. \n\nThe problem is nicotine often makes people who are chronically tired feel more awake so it is a vicious cycle. When my friend quit he described it as actively fighting and being miserable everyday for a year. Also around one year of quitting is especially difficult cause your brain takes social cues from your environment and remembers how miserable you were when you quit. \n\nQuitting is absolutely the best thing you can do for yourself hands down. But it is REALLY hard. You have to really want it and fight like hell to get it. They best thing you can do is go cold turkey surround yourself with friends who you can call when you think about going backwards and realize if you can get through the cravings and just breathe and distract yourself- you can do this. One day at a time. It is an intense journey to battle your own addiction. But you will not regret it and you will be stronger by the end. Smoking tobacco comes with a lot of heavy metals which are the last thing you want as a thalassemic because we already have problems with free radicals.\n\nI have been smoking since I was in 3rd grade. It hurts me and my thalassemia everyday. Im 34yo. I have quit numerous times but always come back. Run as fast as you can away from smoking. If you read up on scientific research, smoking is actually known to raise hemoglobin - but only slightly. \n\nHowever, the drawback from nicotine which makes you sleepy, dazed, lack of oxygen combined with the thal, will produce lethargic symptoms, tiredness, sleepiness, fast heartbeat, and most likely snoring. \n\nI have been smoking for 10 years.", "I do not believe I have thalassemia but I figured I would ask the experts.

I completely understand the repercussionss of drinking on the spleen and smoking with regard to low Hb but how serious is smoking in context to Thal Majors? I mean, I am trying to gauge this for myself as nobody would sit and explain or have a chat about this in order to prevent me from indulging in both, which I have been actively indulging in the last few months. I do not know a lot about it but I do know that smoking can reduce vitamin c which interferes  with iron absorption.  On top of that smoking along with all the negative issues that come with it for anyone, it can be pretty detrimental for someone with Thal Major as it can cause bleeding ulcers etc, and the last thing you need internal bleeding. Your body anyway gets low oxygen due to lesser oxygen carrying capacity of your RBCs. Why would you want to further reduce the oxygen reaching your cell by smoking? I did some digging and found what you have said to be the reason. Apparently, it is not just for the sake of saying that smoking truly *is not* good for Thalassemic Majors (Beta Thalassemia). Temporary inconvenience in life? idk. I think I am ready to give it up for good. Good call! Dude its not worth it. I started fainting after cigarettes You know what is messed up? My pre-transfusion HB has been consistently upwards of 9 since I started smoking again. It makes no sense but I have to stop for the sake of life. Are you Thalessemia alpha / major? I am sure that the affects of smoking/drinking for people with inherited hemoglonopathies like Thalassemia, varies depending on the variants, whether it is stable vs unstable variant, whether the variant has an low or high oxygen affinity, whether you are heterozygous or homozygous, whether the person with Thalassemia has rare mutations/deletions like Bruxelles or High persistence fetal hemoglobin, etc. I cannot even be around cigarette smoke, wildfire smoke, but smoke from medical marijuana does not affect me the same way. My O2 levels are usually pretty low,as I do have Beta Thalassemia Dominant as well as Hb Bruxelles (low O2 affinity, hyperunstable variant). I cannot tolerant alcohol either. That is a definite trigger for severe hemolytic anemia for me. But I have several genetic blood disorders (G6PD Deficiency, Beta Thalassemia,Thrombocytopenia) and have had hemolytic crises induced by seemingly benign things (like paint, glycerin, alfalfa).

I know, i am just so anxious  I will. Its going to be a long week. Thank you for your words. I have been tested for Anemia &amp; iron overload &amp; ferritin? that all came back normal too. The part under RBC morphology says MICROCYTOSIS which scares me a bit. I will try not to worry, I learned to only worry about something when it actually happens or else I have to worry about it twice for no reason. How is your iron? Iron came back normal What about Vit b12 and folate? All normal as well. The previous test said I didnt have anemia or iron deficiency  Did they check your thyroid gland (tsh, t4) sometimes a hypothyroidism can result in microcytosis. Other than that I think a possible explanation could be that you had a bacterial infection, your wbc are slightly elevated and neutrophils are pretty high. It is resolving though and probably in a month your blood would look normal again. Do not think you have any type of thalassemia. But do not trust me I am not a MD, just a biomedical scientist Yes that came back normal too! they tested me for hypothyroidism &amp; I dont have it. They didnt do t4 only tsh. Wbc might be from the throat infection i have? Also im pregnant , would that throw off my bloodwork results? Great they checked your thyroid, honestly I think you really have nothing to worry about. Iron, folate, vit b12 are all okay, hemoglobin too. You might just need antibiotics if your throat is getting worse. Just one more thing, when was your blood taken, did you eat anything prior? Do you know why it says MICROCYTOSIS under the rbc morphology? Also, I got bloodwork done at 2pm and ate breakfast around 10am Because MCV and MCH are lower than normal (but it is not too bad). You might want to get your bloodwork redone first thing in the morning before eating, if that is possible. This to make sure you do not have iron deficiency. Eating can cause a peak in iron, that is why it is best to check iron levels asap after waking up. In case your iron is low, taking supplements will solve the microcytosis. Someone who does not have your complete health history etc. will not be able to diagnose you. I can however say that at your hemoglobin level, there really is not anything to be done urgently from the recommendations that I have seen by health authorities. Some people just fall outside of the norm Cannot tell unless we see several past blood tests showing recurring abnormalities. I have it and basically every blood test I have ever had shows the same consistent low counts In my opinion no. Your hemoglobin is normal and your rbc is normal too. If your iron is also normal that you definitely do not have it.

So simple answer is yes, this is all pretty typical for thalassemia. I frequently recieve iron infusions.\n\nETA: being anemic does not automatically mean you need iron infusions either. I am a woman and needed them while pregnant and now post. Additionally, if you believe you may have thalassemia DO NOT TRY IRON SUPPLEMENTS, unless you would like to get very sick feeling lol. Best thing to do is consult a hemotologist. Your CBC looks nearly identical to mine. Another beta minor here. I have also historically been anemic, does seem to be common. oof about five days ago I did start on iron + Vit C supplements at the direction of a doctor, 65mg once a day. \n\n I feel marginally better, not much worse; but considering the situation is it a 'Go to the hospital now' kind of moment? I had iron deficiency several times, so it is definitely possible! Yes, very likely. Which supplements is he talking If it was advised by a doctor please do follow their advice as I am not a medical doctor. Just keep track of how you are feeling and if it does not work, do not be suprised, it would not for us with diagnosed thalassemia. If you have undiagnosed thalassemia, it is going to be thalassemia minor so no it would not be a go to the hospital thing, not at all. Again, I am not a medical doctor, but if you belive you have thalassemia then you should ask your doctor if that is a possibility for you. \n\nAs a side note, I think anyone in here can share a story about a doctor that had no clue what thalassemia even was so do not be afraid to get a second/3rd/4th lol opinion. Honestly, ER doctors are probably the least likely to know what thalassemia is (in my experience anyway). \n\nLastly, it is relevant what country you live in as well. Everything I am saying is for America. There are many countries (typically of Mediterranean descent i believe) that are far more aware of thalassemia because they possess a larger population of people with it. That said, your nationality *may* give you some insight. Those with alpha thalassemia are more typically of Asian, Chinese, Filipino and beta is typically seen with people of greek, italian, middle eastern descent. If you fall wayyyy outside of these blood lines you may have it and you may have a different cause. \n\nAnyway, hope this helps. Good luck Your sons doctor knows he has thalassemia and put him on iron supplements? Yes. I did not agree at first because thalassemia is pretty common in my family and I was ALWAYS told not to take iron. So I asked for a referral to a childhood hematologist and they assured me that he has thalassemia minor (which they said again and again is not an actual \u201cdisease\u201d but rather the trait). Somewhat I wish they would do an actual genetic test instead of just a blood test because I am really NOT sure how they figure it is just the trait. They also said having thal minor does not protect you from coexisting iron deficiency. Not only that but he will be monitored for iron overload. Two of his doctors told me he will likely always be at least slightly anemic. His ferritin has only been about a 6 for a long time now. I will not know if it is working until his next hematology visit in June. If his iron levels are not responsive he will need iron via IV therapy. Best Nest Multi + for kids and NovaFerrum pediatric liquid iron drops The iron supplements are interesting, but makes sense they would try the least invasive option first. Everything else you are saying makes perfect sense. Yes, it is \"just the trait\" as your doctor explained. We have very mild, if any, symptoms and many times can go undiagnosed into adulthood. The most pressing concern is typically genetic testing before having children. \n\nNow I have found I am a bit more tired, or easier fatigued than others but it is never hindered my ability to do anything (I was active duty military for about a decade, I have multiple degrees, I have children, I work, I am fully capable all around, so if you have been concerned there, hopefully that gives you some peace) so that is why it is typically described as \"just the trait\" even though we have to be cautious about certain things.\n\nI am also someone with anemia induced thalassemia, so even with iron infusions I still sit on the anemic end and I always will. Nothing several cups of coffee cannot fix \ud83d\ude05. Lol. My hemotologist is constantly checking my ferritin and it is what it is at this point. Tbh the iv therapy IS THE BEST! Do not be afraid of it, it made me feel like a million bucks and lasts several months. I recieved them while pregnant and felt so good I sought out to continue on with them with the same hemotologist, I could never go back now. Anecdotally his color has gotten much better, he has more energy, his irritability is improving, cognition improving. \n\nHis iron levels have only marginally improved, from a 6 to I believe 8 something. But his hemoglobin is finally to the lowest normal value. I am also not a doctor but if you ask me, I think the B vitamins are doing that.\n\nI never knew I had thalassemia officially until my early 30s. My first pregnancy was spent sick as a dog on prenatal vitamins (with iron!!) my doctor then prescribed MORE iron on top of that because I was so anemic and I literally could not do it. Soooo bad. Poisonous feeling, really, I shudder to this day when I think of it. And I kept asking to be tested for thalassemia, they told me it did not matter..just take the iron blablabla. So trust me! I get it. I would not believe just any old doctor telling me to give him iron. His anemia was so bad at one point he had a 7 minute grand mal seizure. I wish I had a magnifying glass to his blood chemistry every day, just so I could know exactly what he needs to stay well. For now, we will take the iron daily and await the next blood test. I think IV iron may be better but they wanted to try supplements first. Oh man I am kind of jealous of the IV therapy! I have never been offered, just more supplements, down the hatch! Hopefully my son will be able to get them. \n\nFunny you say that about coffee, the Greek side of my family (whom I can thank for thalassemia), sat drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes all day living to be 100. Thalassemia be damned lol. Lmao, sounds about right! I did not get offered it either until my second pregnancy and man the difference. I am shocked they gave you more pills and not folic acid! \n\nI do so hope your son responds well to everything, it seems he has a very good mom looking out for him. Thank you so much. You have to really be your own advocate with thalassemia. So many American doctors just seem clueless about it, it is mind blowing to me. My diagnosis came from an Indian American doctor and I was so surprised, she ran a blood test on me and right away said I have thalassemia and gave me folate. I gave my son folate on my own and told the hematologist and she said that is great. So we are on the right track Yes! My values are similar to yours and ferritin is at a 3 right now. All resources I find online say that iron supplementation in this case is the only way to go - despite what we are told as thalassemia-ers. Here is a study indicating this is not uncommon:  I have been told the same thing about not taking iron (also beta thal minor), but I am not seeing any reason why. The only thing I can find online is that the thal majors get iron overload from blood transfusions, but for those of us without transfusions, I just cannot find a single reason why we could not take iron if we are low. \n\nMy iron is crazy low right now and I have been supplementing it per my doc's instructions. I am waiting to see a hematologist to get more answers. But I have found that iron deficient anemia is not uncommon for beta thal minors, and that iron supplementation has helped: \n\nI am just wondering if there is info out there I have not found yet and if anyone can pinpoint why iron would be bad for someone with the trait/minor form of beta thal. It is definitely possible! I have thalassemia and iron deficient anemia My doctor said iron infusion can kill a thalasemia beta minor patient, so confused It can if you have iron overload", "I (26F) was recently diagnosed with thalassemia minor beta. What now? Hi reddit,\n\nI had some weird symptoms all my life that I had been trying to find answers for. Constant exhaustion, sudden nausea, intense pain and difficulty breathing following cardio, sensitive stomach and anemia, to name a few. I also suffered two heat strokes in my earlier twenties despite taking care and not being in direct sunlight. My teeth are also thinning twice as fast as they should for someone my age despite a healthy diet - I feel like I am cutting off the head of a hydra fixing one health problem, only for seven new issues to sprout in its place.\u00a0\n\nAfter being misdiagnosed and put on and off iron pills multiple times for anemia, my health care provider basically told me I will just have to live with this for the rest of my life before showing me to the door. I have consulted a nutritionist for advice and have started taking D vitamin, fish oil and other goodies on her behalf. The rest of the information I am finding out for myself.\n\nEssentially, well - what now? I tend to be quite active (work full time, study after work and try to work out twice a day when possible, though in moderation ofc and I take breaks as well) but find myself taking longer to recover from things such as the common cold. Even before exercising so much, I have felt unreasonably tired. And I feel that I cannot keep a consistent lifestyle due to health issues with fatigue or illness coming in the way when I find myself on a roll.\u00a0\n\nIs thalassemia minor beta an immunodeficiency? What should I expect as life unfolds?\u00a0\n\nHope you are all doing good\n\nPs: maybe it is relevant to note that I am vegetarian and have been all my life Honestly, you just keep doing what you are doing. Luckily beta thalassemia minor comes with very minor symptoms. You have had thalassemia your whole life and didnt notice it and that is how it will continue to be. You have already experienced your energy level, you do not know what \"normal\" even feels like so unless you have got a heavy flow one week or you have not been eating those leafy greens, you will always feel about the same as you do now and have always. You are a little more tired than most ppl and sometimes you want to nap all day...no biggie. \n\nWhen I was pregnant my hemoglobin got very low (7.2) but I honestly only knew because of my labs, I did not feel much different ... I got 3 rounds of iv iron sucrose and I was good to go.\n\nI am similar to you in that I work out twice a day (3 if you count dog walking as cardio lol), I work, I have a family with 2 beautiful children and I have a PhD...so what now?\n\nGo enjoy your life. If you want to have kids consider genetic testing with your partner. You are essentially a gene carrier for a potentially much worse condition. \n\nMany doctors are not well informed about thalassemia so my advice is to seek a hematologist who can answer all your questions and put your mind at ease. \n\nYa, we get sick a little easier but we are also immune to many diseases. There has even been some research into being less susceptible to covid.... take that as you will\n\n\nOtherwise, you got this. \u2764", "My doctor said Thalassemia type B minor does not cause feelings of fatigue. Do you think he is right? I mean if it is not my thalassemia or sickle cell trait for my tiredness and fatigue, I do not know what is. Could it be stress? So frustrating! I have been told for years my beta thal minor should not cause symptoms of fatigue but I disagree...lots of us feel fatigue with thal minor. I am still trying to figure out how to manage it. While fatigue can have many causes, I def think thal minor does contribute. A lot of us here feel fatigue. So you can get a second opinion or look up reputable research studies to show your doctor otherwise. \n\nThe studies I have read say fatigue is one of the symptoms, and fairly common. I struggle with this too because let us face it, most full-time working adults in our society probably complain about fatigue on a regular basis... so I do not know if it is my thal B or my lifestyle that leaves me fatigued. That is bullshit, my dad is a pilot in the military and has B thal minor and when he comes home from a long sortie, it feels as if he might drop dead any minute now, doctors these days are becoming more and more inconsiderate. Your doctor is wrong and outdated on thal. Yeah your doctor is wrong. I have hashimoto's too and when my dose was okay and I still felt tired he said \"Well you have thalassemia too so that is why\" He also said if I were to go to higher altitudes I would exhibit more intense symptoms. I feel this!! I complained about my constant fatigue (which i have been complaining about for two years now) and my doctor dismissed my concerns about my thalassemia and told me i was probably just depressed and recommended anti-depressants. I was not impressed by her. Lots of us thal minors definitely feel fatigue! Is this your regular doctor telling you this? It is like a doctor that says you need iron supplements since you are anemic (when this type of anemia is not an iron deficiency and taking iron be harmful if you have iron overload....though it could be the case that one can be thal b minor and have iron deficient anemia as well). The best thing is to constantly educate yourself on your condition so you become your best advocate, and be able to filter through the tons of info and misinformation.  Get a 2nd opinion. I had encounters with some ER doctors and our company doctor dismissed it as \"just anemia\". That beta thal minor should have no symptoms. Tell that to my random internal bleeds AND fatigue AND DVT. My hematologist and cardio and neurologist told me stress and my thal causes and contributes to all of those. Thank you so much and yes this is my regular doctor. I think anyone would know if they were feeling depressed, I do not need someone to force the opinion on to me. He is old, so I am not surprise. I am seeing a lot in the comment section that thalassemia b has a direct impact to high altitudes Yeah but my dad was awarded a gallantry award due to which he is still permitted to fly, otherwise my dad would have been unemployed. I moved to a high altitude and it is pure misery. I can imagine it being just awful. I always wanted to move to Colorado but now I do not think I could. I hope you are able to one day get some relief and find a place better suited for you \ud83e\udd7a I lived in Denver for 4 years and the adjustment was rough, but I definitely got used to it! I ended up really loving CO, but ended up moving closer to family. \n\nIf you think you would like it, take a trip, but make it a long one to give yourself time to adjust.\n\nTo be fair, I did not travel up higher in the mountains or live higher than Denver - I can definitely see it getting harder. That gives me some hope! Thank you \ud83d\ude0a I thought mine caused symptoms but it turned out to be narcolepsy.\n\n\nThal minor may cause some symptoms, but do not cross off other possibilities!

I have thal and had COVID-19 back in December. It took me about 10 days to recover but it was not serious. It definitely is nothing like a cold or flu, so drink plenty of fluids, get rest, and do not over do it at all. \n\nI pretty much stayed in bed the entire duration I had it just to be safe. I also happen to have a doctor in the family and they never once concerned with the fact that I had thal and COVID-19, so I would not stress it too much.\n\nAlso, my hemoglobin is always half of a normal person\u2019s levels, always, so for what it is worth, I fully recovered without issues. Thank you very much for sharing your experience. It is comforting to know that someone with the same condition has recovered from covid-19.

I just got my insurance back so I will be scheduling an appointment with a hematologist soon. That sucks your doctor didnt explain the results to you. Definitely consult with a hematologist if you can ! A lot og general practitioners dont know about Thal. Not me and as far as I know, no body from my contacts of near bout 120 thal warriors have a low MPV, Hb count drops but platelet volume never drops. I will def talk to my dr and see why mine is so low Yep better safe than sorry, have a good life Yaass the general practitioners are not aware so every visit is me teaching them.

I am F20 beta thal major, i was diagnosed when I was about 7mths old. I have to go for blood transfusions every two weeks. \nI really want to know how other major people are dealing with thal this pandemic. The constant fatigue.\nI am so sick and tired of making compromises and letting this thal cut short on so many opportunities. More than the physical pain I hate the routine and regularity aspect of the disease. Having to go for bt every two weeks no matter what. \nMy dr says it will be difficult for me to pursue higher studies abroad (I live in india). I am so sorry. I think I know just how you feel. I am also beta Thalassemia Major diagnosed at one month and get transfusions every three weeks. It feels incredibly limiting to have to deal with it. I will say though that it may not be impossible to go to school abroad with the right amount of research and preparation, depending on the country, of course. How much blood do you get during your transfusions? I get 2 units every two weeks.\n\nWhere do you live? Have you looked into any experimental treatments? This link is not super helpful (I was not able to find current studies in India), but with a a deeper dig there might be more near you and I hope you will find some of the resources helpful:  Hey there bud, am a beta thal major too and that too from india, currently am a doctor in Ruby Hall Pune, was diagnosed when I was 4 months old, yes I do realize that it is extremely irritating to dumb all your plans every 4 weeks and go for transfusion, but do not worry gene therapy will come in a few years, till then try to study as best you can (again I know how much hard it will be when your head feels light and fatigued due to the low Hb),\nI cops my thal by trying to be as strict and regular with my body and medicines as possible, also am used to working like anything even when am sick and fatigued as when you commit to a patient you need to give up o on your sickness so whenever I feel fatigued it does not hinder my life anymore, as far as lack of opportunities would you like to clear cause it is always different for everyone, and I worked with Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and they used to provide me with transfusions given that any military doctor diagnoses me as a beta thal major so if it can be there in Boston it should be in different places as well, just research. Just checked with MGH Boston, they do not provide transfusions any more as there is a lot of expenditure involved, but you can research there will be more hospitals. Oh, I get 4 units (1200 ml) every 4 weeks. Oh? And how much time does that require? 6 hours One hell of a way to waste time Thank you for your reply. By any chance do you know Dr Vijay Ramanan? \nMy dr said having a genetic disorder gets in the way of applying for visa Yep I do know him, he is in Gangaram Hospital now right Um.. 4 bags take 6 hours in total?? Yeah, how much does it take for you ? He runs his ruby hall clinic and does clinical trials. We tried that but it made my hb drop to 5 and caused max fatigue and drowsiness That hydroxy urea Oh god, my 2 units take up the whole day almost. 3-4 hrs per unit Wow which hospital And thalidomide Mata channan devi hospital. It is the one by the MDH owner Yeah I did not opt, sorry for a sec I was talking about Sir Vijay Ramanan but was thinking about Dr. Vikram Matthews. I do not see Dr. Ramanan a lot though, am a Trauma Surgeon so I do not visit the hematology department much, sorry. Ooooh delhi, btw I did my mbbs and pg from aiims del. Just to confirm, you get 4 units transfused after 4 weeks, all in 6 hours? Yes That is as good as I have heard tbh. I will try and talk to my dr regarding this if increasing the no. Of units per transfusion is possible. Caution though you will have to put stricter measures to make sure you do not have a high iron overload, I do not recommend it as that is too much iron in one go for me too but I cannot help it due to my job, the rest is your decision just be cautious. Also by 4 weeks my Hb goes down to 7 so be ready to endure a bit fatigue Oh? Is it because your job requires more energy or smth? Yes will ask my dr about this as I do currently have high iron so that has to be tackled first Lol no it is because being a Trauma Surgeon I have literally no holidays so I need to delay my transfusions as much as possible. Ohhh\nTake care tho Omg it takes me 3hrs for each unit to be tranfused. How can your body deal with 4 units within 6hrs?! That is craaaazy. Hiii i am beta thal major too and I get transfusion every 3 weeks but only 1 unit. I only do 2 units when I go out of the country (pre-pandemic times) just to be safe haha. During this pandemic I feel more fatigue even though I am just at home on my bed most of the time just watching tv and playing games which is weird because pre-pandemic, when there were still face-to-face classes back then, I used to run and walk around the campus most of the time tryna get to class on time lol. \n\nAlso, during this pandemic just as an extra precaution against Covid I took zinc 5mg 2x a day. HOWEVER, I observed that my hemoglobin drop too fast whenever I took zinc. I also had frequent palpitations which rarely happens to me which is why I decided not to take it anymore. Lo and behold, the drop of my hemoglobin slowed down. I am not also experiencing palpitations. \n\nLastly, one major effect that I experienced with this situation is that it is giving me so much anxiety from time to time. As much as  I want to get vaccinated as early as possible, what is hindering me from doing so is the brand of vaccines available here in our country wherein we only have sinovac and astrazeneca vaccines. My dr advised me not to get the astrazeneca because I might develop blood clots since most issue regarding astrazeneca vaccines revolve around it. Sinovac, on the other hand, there is no peer-reviews on it still and i do not know what outcome it will have on me. My only hope for the vaccines now are those made by Pfizer and Moderna because when I asked fellow thals about it they said they had no problems with it all. Well it does take me sometimes 8 hours when there is a reaction. If you do not mind me asking, what chelator/s do you take and its dosage? Because I cannot imagine just how high your iron must be and the level that it is controlled. My most recent ferritin was 1260 ng and I take 1600mg deferoxamine overy a period of 12 hours every day. Sometime ferritin shots up to 3353 ng and in those cases I use Asunra along with deferoxamine. Heyy good to hear from you! How much hb do you maintain I maintain mine around 75 atleast, but last february it went to 63 since I was transfused by the 4th week already. Wow despite transfusing 4 units every 3 weeks with that level of ferritin is amazing to see. It is still too much, got to pull it further down if I want to save my organs Hey thanks I will check this out I can heavily relate to this, I was born with alpha thalassemia and have been getting monthly transfusions ever since(roughly 5 - 6 weeks depending on my hemoglobin level). I am 17 now, not that long ago before covid, I did not have the opportunity to attend class because it was obviously in-person. But since it is now virtual I take advantage of it. Since I was 11 I have upgraded from 1 to 2 bags, meaning whenever I go I always have at least 2 hours to spend. I wish you the best of luck!", "Thal minor easy bruising ? My blood reports are indicative of thal minor. I am of south Asian descent.  My hb is normal though on lower end of normal. Anyone else have issue with easy bruising. I bruise with minor impacts as does my daughter. My doctor says thal minor has no symptoms. Hence confused. No problem with bruising . But i think if you skin are clear that can let bruises be obvious.", "Are my labs indicative of Thalassemia? + Some Health History  I am a 35 year old transman. I began my transition the day the labs in the first column were taken. Prior to transition I gave birth three times. My children were all born premature with no clear reason why.  One of them has spina bifida. I had my gallbladder removed when I was 15. I have a history of fainting spells (started around 10 years old) with no clear reason why. Tachycardia. Asthma. Hypertension. Hypothyroid. PCOS/Endometriosis. There is probably more I am forgetting. \n\nI am always tired no matter how much sleep I get. My hands and feet tend to be cold and I often feel cold when nobody else does. \n\nI have always blamed everything on my thyroid, but after researching thalassemia some, I am wondering if it could be that. I am in contact with my doctor and looking to have more tests done. But in the meantime, I am curious what are your thoughts? I am not a doctor but I would not think thalassemia based on these blood counts. I do not see your iron levels though? Low iron could cause some of the issues you are experiencing, maybe To truly determine if this is thalassemia I would talk to a doctor about getting a hemoglobin electrophoresis test. \n\nIf your iron study is normal, like normal levels for iron and ferritin on top of your low MCV, MCH, and MCHC - it would lead them to figure out if this is thalassemia or another red blood disorder.\n\nIf you were to have thalassemia.. my guess would be minor/trait. Thalassemia is genetic so I do not believe transitioning would be a cause to get it in the first place. Potentially it could make symptoms worse depending on what medications/supplements they may have you on.\n\nFor example, iron is not recommended for thalassemia due to potential iron overload. \n\nI would get tested for it then if you are positive for Thalassemia or any red blood disorders to make sure your doctor knows for your journey.\n\nSince you have PCOS, have they been monitoring your hemoglobin A1C? Thanks. Just to be clear, I do not believe transitioning caused anything. The start of transitioning just happens to be the first time I had the labs done. Iron levels were not checked along with these labs. I am pretty sure that is the next thing my doctor is going to look at. They say a lot of Thalassemia patients who are diagnosed in their adult years were found by \u201caccident\u201d. I believe my doctors next step is checking iron. I am currently waiting to hear back from their office. Good luck! I hope the test results come back faster than expected. hemoglobin and mcv would be low and rdw would be high, i am not qualified to make a diagnosis, but your results do not seem consistent with thalassemia. Looks like Alpha Thalassemia silent carrier if I had to guess. Your blood work is very similar to mine. DNA testing will be the only way to confirm.", "I would like opinions/personal experiences if you are open to sharing.  Hey everybody, great to meet you all. Hope everyone is keeping well!\n\nI think the best place to start is with a brief intro. Around 5 years ago I started getting really light headed dizzy spells (sometimes to the point of almost fainting). I went to see my doctor and he thought I was Iron deficient and prescribed Iron supplements. Fast forward to a couple weeks later when I got the blood test results... My Iron was a fair bit higher than normal and was told to keep an eye on it and stop taking the supplements. Just as I was walking out of the patient room, my doctor was looking at my chart and said \"wait a minute are you Greek\" (last name is Georgiou). My reply.. Yes my Dad is from Cyprus. He sent me for another blood test and sure enough came back positive for Beta Thalassemia Minor.\n\nI get very random symptoms along the lines of chest pains, shortness of breath, feeling really dizzy/tired, lethargic, strange sensitivity to hot/cold, hands and feet that are like blocks of ice sometimes and a strange \"trembling\" type of feeling randomly. I have been sent for pretty much every other type of test out there to rule out something sinister and thankfully they have come back within normal range so far.\n\nFor the most part I would like to think I can go through life and not have to worry about this but I am not convinced that my doctor really knows what he is talking about when I ask him questions about this.\n\nI have two questions that I would like opinions/personal experiences on:\n\n1. Report does not mention \"minor\" but my doctor assured me it is the \"minor\" version. Do you agree with this statement?\n2. I was told that taking supplements: folic acid, B12, Iron will do little to nothing for me. Do you agree with this statement? Trait = minor.\n\nIt is not that supplements do not work, but that if you are not actually low in those things, then it will not matter. Thalassemia can give you similar symptoms to iron deficiency, but you are not low in iron, so taking more iron will not help anything. If you have high iron, it could even hurt you. But I would say that taking a multivite would probably be good for you. My multivite has folic acid in it, they say that is helpful, but do not get your hopes up, I think it helps somewhat, but I am certainly not cured.\n\nDid your blood test include other nutritional tests? I still wonder if you are low in some other vitamin in your diet. B/c your hemoglobin, while abnormal, is not so low that I would think you would get some of the symptoms you say. Someone let me know if I am wrong, but chest pains and shortness of breath while sedentary do not sound normal to me at all for thal minor/trait. Tiredness, cold/sweaty hands are both common complaints. Trembling, maybe? Consider your blood sugar, because I have issues with hypoglycemia/low blood sugar and lately I have been wondering if my thal somehow makes me more susceptible to lows. Low blood sugar causes trembling. Appreciate the reply and thank you for clarifying. I will try out some multivitamins and see if I notice any slight improvements (it cannot hurt to try). You bring up some good points and  I will definitely talk to my doctor about sending me for some nutritional/blood sugar tests. I have not had those from what I can remember. You are welcome! Yeah for blood sugar you can just remember to eat a meal roughly every 4 hours (carbs, protein and veggies) and have a snack in between. I personally find and was recommended to eat protein foods regularly and I did notice a big difference! I was eating mostly carbs before. I have Thal B minor , I too have chest pain and other symptoms but not cold feet or hands. I have very good iron and a bit higher ferritin. 4 years a go my dr gave me iron supplements and I thought I will die of a heart attack because of it. Took me a while to understand it is from iron and since then I have a high resting rate. I do not know if the chest pain is because of thal but I did have my heart check 2 times since then and we found nothing. I suggest you not to take iron at least till u check ur ferritin as well,folic acid will make u feel better and so does b 12. I agree with you, I do not have those symptoms nor do I recall them being symptoms.\n\nI think you should continue to consult your doctor about your symptoms op Thanks for the info and excellent news... I get to eat snacks haha. At this point I should be paying rent at my doctor's office haha. I am actually scheduled to have a consult with an \"internal medicine\" (internist doctor) at the hospital in early may. My doctor has been great but I think this is out of his realm and surprisingly, the majority of the doctors I have seen ask me what \"Beta Thalassemia\" is. I take folate and B12, I cant tell if its \u201cworking\u201d but It has stopped my vertigo attacks Is the vertigo related to the disease? The doctors said it was due to my low hemoglobin- not enough oxygen getting to my brain :/ Thanks for the reply. I think I definitely get this (ranges in severity) and flares up randomly. I can be fine and all of a sudden it happens. I have tried to correlate to activities I do, foods etc. but nothing really seems to trigger it specifically. I got diagnosed with Thalassemia at almost age 40. Once i found out A lOTof things about my health started to make sense .....\n\nEdit: I am alpha minor You would be suprised how not surprising that is lol. I highly recommend asking to see a hemotologist Haha, I am not that shocked to be honest, I have seen my fair share of doctors and I think I can confidently say there are definitely some that are better than others. \n\nI will take this up with my doctor and hopefully he can send me in the right direction. Thanks again for your help/suggestions. I think if the symptoms related to thalassemia minor you will feel them when you was child because we are born with that condition instead of that I think depression play a role in those kind of symptoms so I suggest for you to see a psychiatrist. I am not depressed my friend. Okay then the iron  level will contribute in that because you got ferritin slightly elevated and that harm your health  check with doctor that and maybe he will give you a good diet with low iron Thanks for your opinion. I will look into this for sure. Basically try to eliminate all the body causes then after if that persist switch to psychological way . I forget to notice something the symptoms post covid 19 even you did not knew you got are similar to what ypu suffer from now i personally dealt and i still with those symptoms especially neurological like vertigo anxiety and tremors and lightheadedness This is my situation also That is crazy that you found out later on but I honesty think I would not have known I had Beta Thalassemia unless my doctor noticed my last name being Greek.

I have almost all of those same symptoms as you and I am (29)F so do not feel bad about it. I have been taking beef liver capsules for energy.

Indeed I am not that old and have many milestones ahead: I want to have kids, have a career, and give my best to my family and my workplace. Which means lack of sleep and general care for my body, which then makes me worried if my body could keep up the way others could.\n\n&gt;Do you take folate?\n\nMy multivitamins contain folic acid, but I do not really feel a difference on days when I take them, versus days I miss them.\n\n&gt;sedentary life is not good. Although I myself am guilty of this. I have a spin bike at home but recently have not been using it much...and have been feeling worse as a result.\n\nI agree that constant exercise helps a lot.

Inertia to get back on track is high, but it is something I will always be mindful of and not completely deterred from. Thanks for the response and this is really reassuring. I will keep in mind that before and during my period, maybe I could take a bit more beef and asparagus in my diet :)\n\n&gt;Take naps if you need to.\n\nI love naps, but they do feel like a waste of a good weekend :( I do not mind playing games to pass time when I am tired, and waiting for nighttime to have a good 8-10 hour sleep.\n\n&gt;CBD helps me for anxiety but it is not always for everyone.\n\nUnfortunately we have a strict stance against drugs, where I am from.

And these became worse with age. I am in my early 30s now. How are your periods? Lots of blood loss during periods can result in amplified symptoms of anaemia. Additionally I experience pain in joints that worsens in hot climate. Sounds like we are in the same boat. You reminded my that I experience joint pain in my knees too; they seem to coincide with heavy rain, but not all the time. Sitting/standing too much could cause a similar ache in my shins as well, which alleviates when I rest my legs perpendicularly on the wall/cupboard.\nPeriods are still quite normal I think, heavy on first 2 days, then light for about 3 more.

He was always told by doctors that this presents with no symptoms. He struggles with terrible fatigue in the morning, though, to the point where he had to negotiate an 11:30-8PM work schedule. When I bring him coffee in the morning (it takes him about an hour to climb out of bed) he looks like an absolute ghost. \n\nWe bought a high-end pulse oximeter as Covid prep (I have a separate lung disorder so we prepped hard) and noticed that his A.M. oxygen saturation levels were between 91-93%. Mine are 97-99%. Has anybody else noticed this? Could this be related to thalassemia? In general his O2 levels fluctuate all day between 93%-98%, while mine remain high and stable.  \n\nIs there anything we can do about this--or even just about the morning fatigue? I would love to hear from others who have experienced it. I feel so bad for him, especially because peers, colleagues, and docs have sometimes viewed him as lazy. Living with him, and having a history of congenital illness myself, I can tell he is battling something physical. (All his life he is also been very thin and has a history of depression.) For those tracking thalassemia and Covid, as an anecdotal data point I can note that he DID get Covid in July. He was quite sick and had O2 levels of around 88% at one point, but after 3 weeks he recovered OK--although he was running as exercise prior to Covid and it has not been as comfortable since. I am b thal minor as well with wake up issues. Some of that was alleviated with CPAP and sleep studies so I will just give you that as my anecdotal experience. Taking the sleep study really helped me out but I am still the last to wake up in my household. I do feel bad that I had to give up most of my night activities but I really have to make it a point to keep to my sleep hygiene schedule in order to function in the mornings. \n\nI was always the late night owl until I had kids, but that forced me to change some habits to make it work. If his oxygen levels go down while sleeping, he should get checked for sleep apnea. If that is what it is, a CPAP could change his life.

I believe beta thal minor. I was diagnosed with thal, but they did not specify what type my assumption is based on what my mom has and thinks i have. \n\nRecently, I have been feeling very fatigued, light headed and if I did an intense workout I could barely stand afterwards I was so lightheaded and tired. I realized these symptoms began when I started to retake a women\u2019s daily vitamin, which had 100% of daily iron intake. I immediately stopped taking it and placed a call into my doctor, who is a general/family practitioner. When I told her what I thought was the problem (daily vitamin w/iron) she told me that would have no effect on me and I can take iron no problem, even with thalassemia and that I may even be low in iron. She then tried to tell me my symptoms were essentially all related to depression but she ordered a blood panel for me. I tried to explain that while yes, i struggle with depression, these symptoms were VERY different. Needless to say, this made me not very confident in my physician. \n\nSo, is not iron and thalassemia a big deal? Should not I stay away from iron? Everything I have read and my mother has shared with me is telling me iron is no bueno for me. \n\nI want to change my doctors but am unsure as to what kind of doctor would be best to pursue to get more information on my condition and who would be more knowledgeable on the subject. Im presuming a consult with a hematologist would be best? See a hematologist. Have labs done to see what your iron status is. Then you will know if you actually need a supplement or not. Definitely see a hematologist and get an electrophoresis/HPLC as well as iron studies. You should be careful with iron and only take it when advised by a doctor but it is technically possible to be iron deficient. thank you! thank you! Anecdotally, I stopped taking my daily vitamin because it made me feel rotten (low energy and made my stomach bad too). Turns out it is because it had 100% iron. To test, stopped taking it for a week and it made a huge difference. Would definitely check with doctor. Also beta thal minor. I started feeling so much better after I stopped taking it as well!  Glad you feel better! I am looking to get iron free daily vitamins (my mom got a jar from her local grocery store!), so maybe those will help you as well without completely cutting out daily vitamins. Definitely ask for a full blood count so they can check your blood levels including ferritin. Definitely see a haematologist and explain that you do not know which type of Thalassemia you have. I fear you may have either Iron overload or Low Haemoglobin level which means you may need a blood transfusion. Please see a haematologist it is really important to be aware of what is going on in your body especially when you have Thalassemia. I have Beta Thalassemia Major. thank you! I did a blood panel today but do not see that my physician ordered ferritin. I fear that she is not knowledgeable enough on the subject to place an order for that test. My test results are rolling in and quite a bit is either above or below the standard. I will be asking for a specialist consult as I was quite concerned about iron overload as well. Thank you for your comment i am beginning to wonder if this is at all connected to my chronic inflammation that began ~3 years ago and is unexplained by all that I see. I unfortunately lost my sense of smell as a result and underwent some surgery around a year ago to remove some nasal polyps. Oh no :( I am so sorry to hear that. Maybe speak to the doctor about it and say you feel that it may be connected. I wish you good luck and will keep you in my prayers. Sending lots of hugs \ud83d\ude0a I have thal B minor, same as you my doctor gave me iron vitamins because she did not want to believe that I have thal. From where I come only 4% of population have it. At that time had no idea that I should not take iron , so I took them 2 weeks down the road I thought I was going to die. My heart rate while walking was 200 , feeling like faint,stopped talking them felt better . Is been 4 years all most but I still have high heart rate not 200 but heart resting rate to 90-100 and all this because the dr did not know nor she believed that is the iron. After that I started looking in to it and it says clearly that we should not take any iron supliments holy cow!!! this is so frustrating to hear and I am so glad you figured out the link. I felt like a crazy person as I want to trust my doctor but every thing i have read says basically no iron for people with thal so for my doctor to so blatantly disregard my concerns made me feel like i was wrong. But i also do not want to be like \u201cwell i read on google\u201d... \n\nI forget that it is not a very common thing and my doc probably is not aware. I wish more doctors would just admit to not being knowledgeable and refer people instead of making such dangerous decisions. Please get your ferritin tested, and consult your hematologist. \n\nIf you are taking blood transfusions, please avoid iron supplements at all times. You need to have iron studies done during your blood panel. Simple hemoglobin test will not answer your questions. thank you!! I got my ferritin tests back and i am above the \u201cstandard range\u201d at 168 ng/mL. i honestly do not know the full extent of what that means or the impact on me. I have requested a referral over to a hematologist. thank you so much for your kind words!! Everyone is comments really helped to reassure me that this is NOT in my head and my provider made some gross errors in judgement. I am looking forward to being seen by a hematologist, hoping my provider does not try to delay or prevent my referral. Keep me updated I am rooting for you I hope everything goes well. :) 168 is above non thal range, but quite good. You are in no immediate danger. Mine stands around 300-500.", "Blood antioxidant status and urinary levels of catecholamine metabolites in beta-thalassemia &gt; It has been reported that iron overload in beta-thalassemia leads to an enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and to oxidative stress. We have studied the oxidant/antioxidant imbalance in the blood of 48 transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemic patients (TLP) (17 males, 31 females, 11-22 year), under chelation therapy, and in 40 sex and age matched healthy controls (CTR). Plasma and lymphocyte levels of vitamin E (Vit E), ubiquinol (CoQ10H2), ubiquinone (CoQ10), plasma concentrations of vitamin A (Vit A), beta-carotene, lycopene, vitamin C (Vit C), total thiols, fatty acid patterns of phospholipids (PL-FA), and plasma and urinary markers of lipoperoxidation (TBA-RM, conjugated dienes, and azelaic acid (AZA), as well as the urinary levels of catecholamine and serotonin metabolites, were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), HPLC and spectrophotometry.\n\n&gt; Routine laboratory blood analyses were performed on the same samples; 39/48 TLP were HCV positive. Blood samples were collected just before transfusion, the 24 h urine samples the day before. Our results clearly showed that a severe oxidative stress occurs in the plasma of TLP in comparison with CTR. In fact, the levels of lipophilic antioxidants and ascorbate were severely depleted: CoQ10H2 (-62.5%), total CoQ10 (-35.1%), Vit E (-43.8%), beta-carotene (-31.1%), lycopene (-63.7%), Vit A (-35.9%), Vit C (-23.1%). The impairment of the antioxidant status was associated with elevated plasma levels of by-products of lipoperoxidation and urinary concentrations of catecholamine metabolites and of AZA, indicating a high degree of both neurological stress and lipoperoxidation.\n\n&gt; A significant positive correlation was found between vitamin E and non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) (r = -0.81; p &lt; 0.001), while no correlation was found between antioxidant depletion and ferritin serum levels, average blood consumption, or the presence of clinical complications. The administration of selective antioxidants along with an appropriate diet might represent a promising way of counteracting oxidative damage and its deleterious effects on the progression of the disease.\n\n\n\nHere are the actual antioxidant measurements from the full paper: \n", "World Thalassemia Day: Awareness is the Key to Prevention ", "World Thalassemia Day: 10 facts about blood donation ", "Need advice for better hair care I know this is a weird one, but I learned iron is a helpful supplement for healthy hair growth. I have thalassemia (not sure what type), so having iron problems does not help. I also live in CO which is dry and has low oxygen which also does not help. My hair is always super frizzy and I am trying to see if anybody has recommendations. \n\n\n(This is just extra random stuff below)\nI just found this sub and I have been reading everybody\u2019s advice on better diet care and working out which has been great! I have never had a doctor who is understood the disease so I am trying to find better ways to take care of myself. I did not really think about it until reading on this sub but I am tired a lot, waking up is rough, and I tend to eat a lot of red meat and love broccoli so this is all fun to figure out. 1. Invest in a good shampoo/conditioner. I like Aveda or Redkin.\n2. Deep conditioner/hot oil treatments \n3. I take biotin and a multivitamin \n\nI noticed hair growth once I started deep conditioning. I also get a trim every 6-8 weeks for healthy locks. I have been using the live clean brand, their Argan oil line and coconut milk line are actually amazing. I have curly think hair and it is always been really frizzy but it is been much much less since I switched brands I was looking into tea tree by Paul Mitchell. Do you think that is an alright brand and set to use? My hair is thin, wavy and likes to borderline curl haha! The current shampoo and conditioner I use is renewing+ Aragon oil of Morocco which is probably just a cheap rip off Biotin and argan oil! :)\nAlso how often do you wash your hair? I only wash 1-2 times a week to let my natural oils nurture my hair. That should be fine. I would be sure the formula is not too drying. Maybe try trial sizes before committing to an expensive bottle? It depends if your hair problems are superficial or if there is a bigger problem at play. I had chronic Telogen effluvium because of my low iron, which caused my hair to shed massively for years, this was not fixed until I started taking iron supplements (I have hemoglobin h disease). But if it is just a problem with frizz, deep conditioners should help with the appearance of your hair. Great advice! I will have to go and see if a place has sampler bottles I wash my hair once a day, but I am reading that is alright as long as you have proper shampoo and conditioner, air dry your hair, and I also probably need a humidifier. I am also very not used to putting products in my hair haha! I will have to learn the process and get use to it Well I cannot take iron supplements. I am looking to improve as much around that as possible. And yeah I am learning into better conditioning routines to help improve all the frizzies I was told I could not take iron by my doctors in the uk, but once I moved to Thailand and went private, they gave it the okay for my hair loss, but it has to be monitored closely. Like you said in your post, your doctors do not take you seriously. In Thailand it is a lot more common and well known about. Anyways, my point is, if it is only a superficial problem you are relating to, conditioners will help, but if you are experiencing shedding and dryness from within and you have low iron, it is not something that can be fixed with hair products. \ud83d\ude00 If your hair is thick does not get very greasy, I would recommend shampooing every other night. :) Try the curly girl method, you can find it on /r/curlyhair  it works well for problem hair even if your hair is straight.   \n\n\nI personally have trouble with overly oily hair so it does not work for me.  Even when I lived in Colorado I was dealing with grease problems more than dryness (But skinwise my skin was so dry and still has not really recovered) ur hair state is affected by many factors.  \nif u want to improve your hair and handle things like frizziness u should diagnose ur hair type ( ((  \nof course, nutrition is important for healthy hair, just ddon'tont have any deficiency. from what I have read on google, people who suffer from thalassemia should avoid big amounts of iron but not avoid iron, do not exaggerate Seconding Aveda hair care!

Recently, I have actively been trying to avoid blood testing due to negative experiences I have had whilst the test occurs. A few years ago, while the needle was taking the blood, I felt myself losing consciousness the longer it was in there, things blurred and I felt very tired. After the test was done, I was VERY dizzy and  found myself falling to the floor and I needed to be helped up by two people since I could barely find any strength to get back up. Another situation occurred maybe around 1-2 years ago, where I was fasting when I did the test and threw up bile during the process and it had to be cut short (the doctors(?) said the size of the sample was enough for them to test, albeit being smaller than the one they would usally do). I remember my mother remarking that she saw my lips go pale at some point.\n\nI get the thalassemia from my mother, and she never has these kinds of problems when she does testing now. She often recalls harder times from when she was younger, though. I want to know if it is common to experience these strange hardships with your thalassemia during blood testing? And also if it gets better as you age?\n\nI have a blood test in a few hours as of writing this post and I tried to sleep early but I actually woke up from stressing over it, I think, lol. Thank you for any comments or help! What type of thal do you have? That makes a lot of difference. It is worth getting tested if you do not know. \n\nI will not speculate on your symptoms since I am not a doctor, but definitely get a doctor to run a blood test, or ideally a DNA test. That will help future diagnoses a lot to know your specific mutation and be able to tell your doctor.\n\nAll that said, it is pretty normal for thal to screw up blood tests in crazy way if the doctors do not know to look out for it. I have found it is better to just tell the phlebotomist (the person who takes your blood) in advance. Most of the time they know how to handle the situation. To my knowledge, I have thalassemia beta. For the first time I did the test laying down yesterday and did not experience any problems, but that still brings up confusion as my mother has the same type and she is never had to lie down for it. I am not a doctor and this by no means medical advice, but it you do not have any daily symptoms of your thalassemia you probably have the beta minor variety. I will not give medical advice here, but it is usually just a disease that you can live with if you have healthy habits. Eat well, exercise, and let your doctor know. Thank you so much for your help!

Has anyone tried using ( to help with the anemia that comes with thalassemia? \n\nI have only read of people with iron deficiency anemia raving about it. I am aware that people with thalassemia are meant to avoid iron as it can lead to iron overload but is this type of iron different from other iron supplements as it is \u201cnatural\u201d (there are some synthetic ingredients in there).\n\nI am primarily taking these because I want to see if they help stop my hair falling out. If anyone has any experience with anemia and hair loss and has some tips I would be more than grateful. I have already had my hormones and thyroid checked before anyone mentions that, they were all good.\n\nThanks! Has this supplement helped at all? I am not 100% sure because....\n\nBefore I took the blood builders I was sleeping badly. At the time I took blood builders I also started playing rain noises which kept me in a deeper sleep which means better sleep and more energy. I was not crashing as hard at work anymore. It is hard to tell if this is because of the tablets or the rain sounds.\n\nHowever I went to my doctor and my iron before taking the tablets was 42 and now it is 50. Which means they have helped raise my iron. Which is a good thing! \n\nUsually doctors will say do not take iron with haemoglobin h disease (a beta thalassemia I think). However my new doctor said that it is only advised against with patients who have iron levels of like 200-300 which would cause iron overload. He said tiny amounts of iron (like the ones in the blood builder) should be beneficial. Anyways he is testing my blood again in 3 months to see how it is just to be safe.\n\nThat seems rambly but I am trying to get the whole picture out. So yes it has helped my iron levels and I think they did stop me feeling as tired but I cannot say I am 100% sure. \n\nI would recommend trying them but please inform your doctor and have your blood checked again in a few months. \n\nHope this helps! Side note: In terms of hair loss my hair is still falling out. \n\nI have just started working with a doctor to fix it (the doctor referred to above). He diagnosed me with telogen effluvium and dermatitis on the scalp which is also making it harder for my hair to grow.\n\nBasically he said my iron needs to be at least 60 for the hair to stop falling and I am currently at 50.\n\nMay I ask what your iron levels are? My doctor just put me on 1000mcg of folic acid. I am getting my blood test soon and I will figure out if I will need to take an iron supplement.

I inject desferal almost everyday to the point the arms are full of scars.\n\nam i doing something wrong? is it my diet?\n\ni just do not know what to do anymore..  \nIt could be that the doctor needs to up your dosage if you are not maxed out for your body weight. It could also be that you need a combination therapy. Sometimes using two iron chelators is better than just one and with oral options it can cut down on the amount of times you need to inject. I have been on a combination of desferal and jadenu for a while and my ferritin has finally gotten down to acceptable levels. I know how rough it is to have to do desferal like every single day. And I hated putting it anywhere other than my arms but when they got too scarred up I started rotating my sites to my outer thigh as well. I would call it \u201ctolerably painful.\u201d But I still think your best bet is adding an oral med some you can cut down on desferal or switch completely to an oral medication  and kick desferal to the curb. \n\nRegarding diet, there are some small things you can be aware of but dietary iron is not a huge contributor to your ferritin level in the big scheme of things. Iron from meat will be absorbed more readily than iron from plants because it is already in the correct configuration. Iron from plants needs to be converted before it is stored which gives your iron chelator more time to get it out. Calcium helps to block iron absorption so eating some sort of dairy product with your meal may help curb some iron uptake. Also, tannins have the same effect so drinking black or green tea with your meal can also help block some absorption. Vitamin C has the opposite effect where it increases iron binding. However, vitamin C is actually very helpful if you take it at the same time as your infusions. Every time I start my desferal infusion I take 500-1000mg of vitamin C. \n\nDo not lose hope! I have definitely been there and it just plain sucks but getting our iron under control is one of the best things we can do for ourselves and our long term health.

Everything I read said it could make this value lower. So in actuality, my A1C may be higher than 5.9? (My fasting glucose was 109.)\n\nI would completely cut out soda and most sweets.

But if you are TDT like I am, diabetes is inevitable and early glucose management is key to beating lots of odds and complications. \n\nMetformin was a option due to my high OGTT results and the lifestyle change was carefully evaluated by many hours of research and talking to other patients and health professionals. \n\nOn average 6 months on 500mg Metformin, my SF ranges from 268 - 281, HbA1c +\\-5.6. Fingerprick every other day, twice a day. Mind you, these numbers did not come easy. It was every much trial and error. One period I would eat whatever I wanted and irregularly as I could and another on keto/healthy food planning. The difference was by a whole landslide. Better off with food planning. 6 months off Metformin, my number ranges the same on meds with the keto diet, alternate intermittent, higher water intake and mod exercise. Although, a cheat day once in awhile is also healthy for the soul. Just do not over do it or make excuses to have more. Believe me, your body and numbers will hate you if you go off the wagon once you get onto this lifestyle.\n\nCurrently, I am off Metformin. But twice a year I will do a week or two of Dexcom readings to see the overall functions of my glucose and a yearly OGTT. These two stats are my key factors whether when I will go on or off Metformin. \n\nKeep in mind many Thal strands are not the same and have different needs. Knowing what works for you, understanding the information and advocating to know/getting more from your health team is essential to Thal management. I hope this helps answer some of your questions and then some. Stay safe and be well. I am beta minor type but I am hypoglycemic and super sensitive to glucose as well. I am fairly thin and otherwise healthy but sugar just hits me so hard compared to literally anyone else I know except diabetic friends. Just read this:\n\n\" There are only a few studies that have looked at the effect of beta thalassemia trait and alpha thalassemia on HbA1c. Glycated haemoglobin measurement is not affected in beta thalassemia trait \"\n\nSuggests that your HbA1C is accurate. Well, that sucks, though it could be worse...at least my HbA1C is not actually higher than 5.9.\n\nI thought perhaps my HbA1C was not consistent with my glucose level of 109 (which is only ten points over the threshold). What are Thal strands? As I understand it, there are subtypes (for lack of a better word) of beta thalassemia and some sort of DNA test is necessary to identify them. Is that what you mean? Would there be any benefit to have further testing done to know precisely which kind of beta thal minor I have? Thx! How did you increase your electrolytes? Gatorade? Strands and types,I use interchangeably depends who I am talking to. They are 2 beta globin genes or to some 2 types of beta thalassemia (minor and major) which you can get tested to see whether you got one faulty beta gene (minor) or two faulty beta genes (major). To find the exact genotypes, get a hemoglobin test done. Professionals will give your better insight on your particular type. Many beta minors have completely healthy lives without any complications or needing treatment. But knowing the type you have will give you a peace of mind when doing certain activities or when you start a family. I hope I was able to answer your questions and I wish you all the best. Take care. Thank you for your response. I understand the difference between minor vs. major (one gene or both), but beyond that, I am pretty clueless.\n\nWhat sort of hemoglobin test determines the genotype of beta thalassemia minor? \n\nThx again! A cbc or a special hemoglobin that detect for it. Best to Ask your primary or hematologist. There are many factors that will help better find a test that will suit your concerns. Be very open and ask lots of questions before doing any tests. Also, you can get genetic testing done too. My parents did that for me and siblings only because we have other line of illnesses in our family pool. Thanks. I have already had the hemoglobin electrophoresis test (several times) to verify the BTM. Will look into further testing to pinpoint the type. Ah found another study on the effects of thal b minor on A1C tests:\n\nSays it makes it higher than it really is.\n\n**Results:** Sickle trait hemoglobin had no effect on glycated hemoglobin measurement by Synchron LX20 while B-thalassemia minor blood elevated the value of glycated hemoglobin to the range of diabetic cases.\n\n**Conclusion:** Synchron LX20 glycated hemoglobin immunoassay method gave falsely high glycated hemoglobin results with B-thalassemia minor patient samples. Therefore, while interpreting the results of Synchron LX20 glycated hemoglobin, the patients history regarding hemoglobinopathies should be checked. That is great news!", "Well looks like I was right and my doctors were wrong! I was right when I told them I have both Alpha and Beta. I am an Alpha carrier and have Beta thalassemia minor. And my doctor's keep saying i had neither. \n\nTo top it off I do not have any dna close to the Mediterranean, middle east, or south asia. The closest I have is French. Which only shows up through my father's side as that one french person. \n\nIn France it is 1 in 100,000 to have beta now. It makes me question the rarity of it when that single person married into the family. Other than the one person, I some how have both with no ancestry going back to the usual suspected ethnicities. \n\nIt just comes as a surprise yet not a surprise if that makes sense. Because I know it is rare to habe both, but rare to have both with none of the typical ancestry. I am a fluke. A genetic anomaly in my family and surprised my doctors. I am also the only one of 4 siblings to have had results show up like this. They were all tested at birth as I was, and I am the only one. \n\nIt is scary yet joyful to finally have an answer. Looks like I get to have the joy of telling my Ob-Gyn to set up testing for my son either soon or just after birth. Ancestry DNA estimated my heritage to be 97% British Isles and 3% Germanic Europe, yet I carry the trait for Beta Thalassemia (inherited from my dad). We looked at our family marriages and papers of the like. Its definitely interesting finding out that doctors mainly suspect one of the main three ethinic ancestries, yet they get surprised when its possible for someone to have it, yet not be of those three. Something I had not realized about France, until I lived there. There are quite a few Mediterranean French people. France has a Mediterranean coast and the Island of Corsica is very French and very Mediterranean.\n\nForgot to add, a bit of good news, your child *can* inherit the thalassemia but it is more likely to be passed when the father is the carrier in many cases. My husband\u2019s family has the trait and it was passed to my daughter but my SIL did not pass the gene to either of her children, even though she and my husband are both carriers and I am not. I wish you the best! My family knows that thankfully, but our doctors do not lol. They assume italian, Egyptian, honestly more the eastern side of the Mediterranean. In my husband\u2019s family, they have just one tiny branch of the family that traced back to Sicily and we are fairly certain this is where the trait came from in their case. \n\nIt is kind of crazy when you think about it. Some ancestor survived malaria because of this \u201cdefect\u201d and the trait just keeps on going. It is hard, especially when doctors do not realize how much it can affect your everyday life. I am hoping that one day there will be an easier and less invasive way that I could share bone marrow with my daughter. Doctors will not even consider it now because of the risks but it is being used to completely cure sickle cell anemia and could possible be used for thalassemia. Fingers crossed!! I cannot wait for them to consider it! Especially if my son gets a weird combo of what I have! \n\nI also fimd it is awesome to be \"immune\" to malaria too. I also boat to my brother I could survive malaria if I got it! So one parent has alpha and the other has beta? Do you have any symptoms? I guess the number of alpha &amp; beta proteins match up with you? Are you anemic ?\n\nI too have a rare combination - beta thalassemia minor and HPFH (Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin). Which is good because the fetal haemoglobin (gamma) production ramps up to take the place of the missing betas. Yay for me, I suppose? No clue my parents never got tested, and I have some symptoms, but they are not severe and have changed during my pregnancy. I was anemic up until pregnancy I know that at least, though the extra blood production helps! \n\nThat is really cool! Though I have no idea of my combo since the doctor's have not bothered testing that far. I just was surprised to end up a carrier of one and have the other. Especially since I was the first one in my family to indicate it was even in the family. Also the only with positive testing. My mom got some testing but its did not show up. I can only guess one had a double carrier and one carried one and I got lucky enough to get the combo. My siblings I have not a clue they have no positive results. Since in my state its mandatory to test infant's at birth, they all got tested. How much quantity of fetal hemoglobin you got \n\nIm also have beta thalassemia minor and in hemoglobin electrophoresis show 3 (hemoglobin A 93 % hemoglobin A 2 5.4 % hemoglobin Fetal 1 %  is that good ? Through that i can mybe told how you inherited that i think : \n\nOne of your parent have alpha thalassemia silent that affect 1 gene in alpha chains and did not show up any symptoms even in CBC or hemoglobin electrophoresis its literally silent and its need genetic testing. \n\nAnd the other have beta thalassemia minor and all we know it light to moderate symptoms \n\nOr the second hypothesis that one of your parents carry them both and you get them both . Like 30%... My dad had HPFH without beta thalassemia and he has 10%.\n\nSince fetal hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen I have always wondered what physiological affects it might have had. Guess I will never know. Possibility for sure. My Hematologist is going to do some monitoring and see what pops up. I am very curious to find out what he comes up with! Yeaaah what about the other hemoglobin that you got and have you got thalassemia minor from your mother ? that for sure because your dad did not have it and last question how you deal with thalassemia minor  you have some symptoms or not if you have what kind of symptoms.  Thanks And my answers  about why you got high amount  of fetal hemoglobin is because of BTM that cause increase in hemoglobin A 2 and hemoglobin F that is how we know it from hemoglobin electrophoresis without need to pass to genetic testing \n\nAnd about the affinity of oxygen it concerns red blood cells and their number and volume if the volume are normal it can carry much hemoglobin then hemoglobin carry  much oxygen and also the number of red blood cells .", " Help is a Needed in Understanding the Connection Between Caregiver Distress and Medical Adherence!!!

That is how I was diagnosed. Thank you! I will talk to my doctor about it. Is yawning a thalassemia thing?  Every time I workout I yawn like crazy during it.  Thal beta minor Honestly I think you will have to ask your doc to specifically do lab work for this. Mine always pulled up as \u201canemic\u201d, but fortunately my primary doc did not understand why since my iron levels were normal. She sent my blood work to another clinic specialized in looking for that, and they confirmed that I had beta thalassemia. My vote is negative for Beta Thal.\n\nYou have a normal MCV, which would be odd for Beta. You also have a low RBC. I have seen and experience a higher RBC - my theory is that it is a way to compensate for the MCV. Beta Thal = more small (less efficient) blood cells than normative population. This is beneficial against malaria, as malaria attacks blood cells. More blood cells (even if they are less efficient) = higher chance for survival. Also, Hgb 13.4 is lower than average, yes. But, ask around here and you will find 13.4 to be a good number among many Beta Thals. Anyhow, proper testing (as mentioned below) is always helpful. Hopefully it is not Beta Thal. and is something you can manage with changed lifestyle habits or supplementation, as you mentioned. Your mcv is normal which does not really happen with Thal . I could be wrong though To add to this. Bilirubin is almost always a bit over normal range. I am going through the same thing i was diagnosed beta minor during my marriage testing.

However, this reminded me of another bloodwork she had and  I looked back at it (from August 2018) and then she had a barely below normal MCHC with normal hemoglobin. I remembered my mother telling me about how she used to be fed horse meat when she was young because she was \"weak and sickly\" and in the conversation, she mentioned that my grandfather had \"the Mediterranean anemia\" which lead me here. In the last year or two, my daughter has had a few issues and has seen a number of specialist with no real answers. In one incident, she passed out on an airplane (we travel all the time so it was not unusual for her) but she was not really coming around. The airplane put her on oxygen and then she stilled passed out again and took hours before she felt okay. At another time, she had a low grade headache and fatigue that lasted weeks. She literally laid in bed the entire time because she did not feel well when she stood up. A friend who is a doctor said that since her MCV was normal (back in 2018), it is likely just iron deficiency anemia. I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this. Is it worth having her tested or taking her to a hematologist? When they tested her hemoglobin the other day it was a pin prick so it did not include a whole panel. I would suggest getting her doctor to do a whole cbc test. From what I know having beta thal minor,  we typically have a higher red blood cell count.\n\nNormal range for the RBC count is 4.0 to 5.4 mine is 5.67\n\nNormally RWD-CV is 12.8 to 18.4 mine is 20.8\n\nMy hemoglobin count is 9.9. The highest my hemoglobin count has ever been measured at was 11.4 and that was for a short time after pregnancy. My hemoglobin tends to sit at 10.4 and my hematocrit between 31 and 33.\n\nMy RBC morphology is marked, meaning they are misshapen. They are small and pale and carry oxygen poorly.\n\nAs for the passing out, that might not be anemia so much as orthostatic intolerance.  Check her blood pressure and heart rate while laying back, then sitting up, then standing.  If her blood pressure drops and her heart rate jumps up 20 or more points with the posture changes you might look into seeing a cardiologist instead of a hematologist.  So you know, orthostatic intolerance can make you feel horrible. Postural Orthostatic intolerance  aka POTS is one of those zebra type disorders doctors tend to overlook because they are taught, \"if you hear hoof beats it is probably a horse not a zebra\"  meaning to expect common ailments rather than uncommon ones. Yes, get her tested! I had similar random incidents growing up, and it all made sense when i was diagnosed at age 40 &gt;orthostatic intolerance\n\nShe was seen by a cardiologist and a neurologist and the neurologist (ironically) said something like \"could be POTS\" and told us to give her salt pills but it was so inconclusive, we did notl What is the actual test for it? First my doctor ran a bunch of bloodwork, a hemoglobin chromatography, hematocrit, rbc count based off those results ordered a genetic test. I believe only a genetic test can prove you have thalassemia Ugh I hate that.  She needs a table tilt test to be sure.\n\nOne thing that would not hurt her in any regard is to make sure she stays well hydrated. If her blood pressure is good test and see if adding a little extra salt helps.  My mother had POTS and extra hydration and sodium kept her from feeling horrible. There is a certain blood test for thalassemia. Pretty simple just a couple tubes for me and I knew later that week. I also would faint a lot when younger! My dad and I (he also has the beta) have to take lots of folic acid it really makes a difference, especially with my breathing when excersicing and my blood being able to clot during my period. You can DM me on any questions about my experience! Just go to the doctor and have her tested for thalassemia. Taking extra iron could be dangerous if she does have it. The test is called hemoglobin electrophoresis test. So I seem to be getting push back from the doctors office because they do not think there is any concern for this despite a family history and they are telling me to just have her take iron and retest in a month. Is it possible for her to have nearly normal bloodwork and have this condition?", "Thalassemia Market Is Predicted To Grow At CAGR Of 10.8% In Forecast Period ", "Thalassemia trait and Anemia - use of iron? Hi all, \n\nI was always told I had the thalassemia trait which I got from my mom although I have never gotten any comprehensive testing to find out more about what type. \n\nRecently, I have been tired all the time and got basic blood tests done and was told I am anemic. I had let my doctor know that I also have thalassemia minor and she prescribed me iron supplements.\n\nI tried taking them for about a month and had awful GI upset to the point where I had to stop taking them. This is a new doctor so I am a bit skeptical but she is now suggesting iron through IV which makes me a bit nervous.\n\nI also have read multiple sites saying that you should not take iron with thalassemia but could concurrently have anemia so I hope that is my case and I was not wrongfully diagnosed due to a lack of education of thalassemia in my area. \n\nIs anyone able to read my results and confirm that diagnosis for me and if I truly do have anemia AND thalassemia minor? Has anyone in the same boat gotten iron infusions and what is your experience? Is it worth it? \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I am currently in contact with my doctor but I wanted opinions from those that understand thalassemia trait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\n I am not an expert but I am not even seeing iron deficiency here? My son has beta thal minor and is iron deficient and taking supplements. I have always heard the same thing, not to take iron, so I kept asking the doctor if she was sure lol. She said having thalassemia minor does not make you immune to iron deficiency and if you are anemic you should supplement. \n\nHis iron was extremely low and they thought about doing transfusions but he is doing fine on a supplement. \n\nYou have to get your levels tested like every 6 months to make sure you are not getting overloaded though. Thalassemia and iron deficiency anemia are two completely different things. Anemia is classified as a lack of red blood cells which thalassemia is. You have thalassemia minor which causes low hemoglobin, aka oxygen, in the red blood cells AND anemia because you have less red blood cells. You are iron is fine so you do not have IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. I for example have alpha thal intermedia and I am anemic due to low red blood cells and hemoglobin, but I have more iron than normal due to multiple blood transfusions. My doctor has told me iron in food is fine because it would take A LOT of it to make a difference. They told me NOT to take iron supplements. You should only get iron infusions if you are deficient which you are not. I recommend you get a hematologist if you do not already have one. If your doctor who told you to get iron infusions is a hematologist, get a second opinion from another hematologist. They are the only ones who really know anything about blood disorders and will not mistake your anemia from iron deficient anemia See, I thought maybe I was missing something but I was unsure what would indicate an iron deficiency besides low iron which the labs did not show. After experiencing bad side effects I started to question it. I wanted to trust my doctor and thought that would explain why I am always fatigued but it seems that thalassemia minor is very misunderstood, especially in my area. I appreciate your input It kind of blows my mind that I would be prescribed iron if my iron levels were within range. Your explanation makes a lot more sense. The doctor that gave me the iron supplements is a PCP but I wanted to trust her since I feel like I am clueless about thalassemia. I will definitely look into getting a hematologist. Do you know if there is anything that they would do for having thalassemia minor or would I just be able to get a formal diagnosis? I am still experiencing extreme fatigue so I do not know if that is related to the thalassemia minor or would be something else. I appreciate your reply. If you have thal minor you CAN have low iron but you should not take iron pills without a test showing you have low iron. I also get my ferritin levels checked as it is an indicator of the amount of iron your body has stored (not circulating). My hematologist prescribed me folic acid which is a type of vitamin B and helps your body produce more red blood cells. I do not feel like it makes a difference in my fatigue however. Some people say to take folate since it is basically a stronger version of folic acid, and my multi vitamin has folate in it, but it still does not help me. The only thing I found that helps is getting at least 10 hours of sleep at night which seems a little excessive for most people since the min is usually 7-8, but I need it and I can tell if I do not get the 10 hours. \n\nIf you ever want children, the hematologists also recommended you do a genetic test done for you and your partner to see if you would carry the trait over to your children, but that is not an issue for me since I do not want kids. I am not sure what else a hematologist can do for you if you are thal minor or trait. I have to be careful when I get sick because my hemoglobin drops and if it drops below 7, I have to get a blood transfusion. Only my hematologist does the blood test or CBC to tell me what my hemoglobin is. \n\nAs well as normal hematologists, There are also specialists for thalassemia. I see one in Oakland, CA every year since they have a special magnetic test to check my iron levels. I just saw them a few weeks ago and they actually prescribed iron chelation pills to reduce my excessive iron, but they have to be monitored every 2 months when I take it to make sure my iron does not get too low. \n\nThere is also conferences for people with thalassemia or sickle cell anemia to get together and learn about the diseases as well as meet people similar to you. I am in a Facebook support from for thalassemia and they are helpful because I feel like I am not alone in my diagnosis since I do not know anyone in real life with it too. If I remember correctly, iron deficiency is actually separate from anemia. Anemia is a low hemoglobin, which I think you are kind of just stuck with if you have thalassemia. The doctor told me my son will always be \u201canemic\u201d, but when the iron is low you can and should get it back to normal values. I hope that does not add any confusion to an already kind of confusing issue! \n\nI am just not sure why your doctor would prescribe iron for anemia if it actually is not due to low iron. I think it would be worth it to clarify with your doc or get another opinion because I have not found any doctor i trust on this besides a hematologist. Like you said, many do not seem to even understand it themselves. Personally it took me over a decade before I found a doctor who did not try to give me iron because it makes me sick too. So I was very leery of giving it to my son but he actually does have low ferritin, unlike myself.\n\nAnemia=\\=iron deficiency That is really helpful. I have always felt the same way, even with 7-8 hours of sleep a night I am exhausted and could easily come home and nap for 2 hours every day if I allow myself to. It seems like it would be really beneficial to find a hematologist and I will look into folic acid/folate and talk with a doctor about it. It took the doctors in my area to diagnose me with beta thal 3 years, I was very anaemic and had supplements but I was not absorbing them properly so I had an iron infusion it helps slightly and I am not really iron deficient anymore, though it does make you feel pretty shitty for a few days after. But if your iron is not low and it is just anemia from having thalassemia I do not think infusions are the right thing? Try find a specialist maybe? \n\nI think with thalassemia though your blood levels will always be slightly low regardless unfortunately I still am slight anaemic opposed to the average person but yeah that is normal with someone with thalassemia \n\nI faint a lot also, I thought that was related to the anemia and thal but turns out I have vasovagal syndrome so if you faint really often I would suggest getting that checked too DO NOT TAKE ANY MORE IRON, supplements OR IV.  I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous excess iron is for a thal minor when they are not iron deficient. You are NOT deficient. Thalassemia anemia and iron deficiency anemia are two different things. Our red blood cells are not working properly because of our genetic code, not because we do not have enough iron. \n\nSome thal minors also might have an iron deficiency for other reasons and they will be able to take something if indicated by their doctor, but our red blood cells being kind of shitty means that any excess iron will not be filtered through the body efficiently and iron excess is very dangerous. \n\nYour blood work shows your iron at 104. The numbers next to it show a normal range of 33-151. You would only need to be supplemented if your iron fell below 33. Obviously, you are well above that. \n\nYou need to see a hematologist who will explain this disorder to you thoroughly and establish a baseline for your bloodwork. I am beta thal minor and I see my hematologist every 3-6 months for a full blood draw where they check everything including iron. If you want to have children they will guide you to genetic testing for you and your spouse because two people with the trait have a very high risk of giving their child the severe form of the disorder. \n\nYou should also consider a new PCP as this one has literally put you in danger because they could not read a basic blood test. Looks like microcytic anemia. Mcv less than 80, but then rbc on high side. Maybe good to check \"serum ferritin\" to before considering iron supplements.\n\nAlso serum ferritin in an inflammation biomarker. So have to do a few more checks to rule out inflammation first....\n\nYou taking any supplements besides iron?", "Did anyone else see this story on NPR: 1st Patients To Get CRISPR Gene-Editing Treatment Continue To Thrive  Very exciting news. Hoping this is the start of something wonderful for us all. For me who does not need blood transfusion, I hope we get to the level it is a more common treatment. I am so tired of being tired all the time. Same - that was disappointing for me as well. My dad and I both have beta thal so we were initially excited but hopefully the treatment eventually becomes more widely accessible. So many things took time to get to market, like IVF. I remember the first \u201ctest-tube\u201d baby and how taboo it was. Now I have my son because of IVF. I think it is socially more acceptable for this kind of science so hoping it gets to us sooner rather than later.", "Have you had success with any particular foods to manage anemia? So i have Thalassemia minor and i would like to know how you manage it and how often you get anemia because of it. These past two summers i have had pretty bad anemia and had to get an infusion the first time. I would never been so anemic before and i thought it was just the stress from uni.\n\nBut now i feel like i may be anemic again, just 5-6 months after the last time i took iron medication. I would like to not have to do that again because of stomach issues. Have you had success managing anemia with diet? What do you eat for that? You should talk to your doctor and should not really take supplements with this unless they are prescribing them. Are you sure you have minor with a blood transfusion? \n\nGoogle iron rich foods. Eat foods with heme-iron such as red meat. Liver is probably the best food for iron, if you are brave enough to cook with it. You could also look into cooking with a \"lucky iron fish\". Thankss. My mom cookes liver but i hate it. Ill go with the red meat and fish \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Yeah, every single time i had anemia she prescibed me with iron pills. I think that is standard.\n\nAnd what do you mean? I didnt have a blood transfusion, it was an iron infusion. But that doeant change the type of thalassemia If you are female, then you only need 3oz of liver to meet your daily iron needs. If you are male, you need about half that. So it might be worth having like two bites of liver once in awhile, it is amazing because you do not need a lot. But yes, red meat will work. Fish has much less iron, but still works. If you are more of a veggie person, you can look at greens like broccoli or spinach, but veggies contain non-heme iron so your body will only absorb part of the iron instead of all of it. Ohh that is interesting! I will research more about the liver and maybe i can force myself to eat it, because all this time i did not even want to take a couple bites because i thought it would not be enough to do anything My wife has Thalassemia minor and experienced anemic symptoms for most of her adult life. We have always tried to make more iron-rich meals (ex. Steak, spinach, beets, broccoli, tofu) which only seems to help sometimes. \n\nWhat really made a difference for her energy level though was taking vitamin B. I saw your comment and went out looking for b supplements but only found b-12? Is that it? I am by no means an expert, but I believe B12 is in a lot of energy products specifically to raise energy. \n\nThe Vitamin B my wife takes does include B12 but also other medicinal ingredients as well. The one my wife takes also has vitamin B6, biotin (vitamin b7), pantothenic acid (another form of vitamin B), folic acid (vitamin B9), and some other medicinal ingredients.\n\nHope this helps! I do not know if it is a placebo effect but I got the b12 last night. I already take a multivitamin with biotin and folic acid in it but I actually did notice a difference in my energy levels overall today (and that is with less sleep than normal too). I am going to keep tabs on it for the next couple weeks but I am really hopeful Happy to hear! All the best! i have alpha thal minor and I always take vitamin D 2000 IUs, iron bisglycinate with copper (copper is important for absorption of the iron), vitamin B complex, and 2000 mcg of folic acid.

Hey guys, I do not have thalassemia, but I am here for a friend of mine. She is 23 years old and has beta thalassemia major. She feels terrible every time she goes for her transfusions (understandably so) and feels like her life will always be bad and can never get better. She is been battling depression and anxiety for the most part of her life and her condition is one major reason for that. She constantly feels like giving up. I really wish I could help her feel better and make things easier for her, but I have never been successful with that and it hurts to see her go through this. So, can someone please help me help her out here? Maybe, tell me how you have dealt with the associated difficulties or better, if you would be willing to talk to her about this yourself? I am sorry if I am asking a lot but I would really appreciate it if anyone here can help with this. I have beta thalassemia major and those days leading up to the transfusion and transfusion day SUCK! Not to mention the countless doctors appointments and follow up care. It is exhausting.  I also struggled with some depression and anxiety. These are my major strategies\n1) I got help. I saw a CBT therapist that specializes in chronic medical conditions and acceptance. I saw her consistently for a year and now it is only about 2-3 times a year to check in with my self and my coping strategies.\n2) Transfusion days are now my treat yo' self days. I bring my IPad to the hospital, Watch Netflix, eat tons of junk food, paint my nails, text or call all those ppl I have not reached out to in forever. \n3) I take the whole day off for Doctors appointments. 15 min virtual appointment? No prob I am taking the day for my mental health. I am very fortunate that my employer supports this.\n4) Days leading up to the transfusion are the hardest. I need to make sure that on those days I am getting lots of extra sleep, going for a walk and drinking water. I also use CBD/THC just on those days for pain. Which works  great for me but is not everybody's thing. \n\nThese are the things that work for me. All the best to your friend. Thank you so much for this! All the best to you too! \ud83d\ude0a I am beta Thalassemia Major too, transfused every three weeks and I have done basically the same strategy as the first poster. At around age 25 I was really burning out and getting a lot of anxiety so my hematologist suggested a psychiatrist for medication and a therapist who specializes in people with chronic conditions. Both have helped immensely. \n\nAnd yes, transfusion days are definitely \u201ctreat yo\u2019self\u201d days. I grab a lunch from my favorite deli, lots of snacks, movies, games, books, whatever will help keep me entertained and my mind off the transfusion. \n\nAlso, I do not know how your friend has been dealing with the constant needle sticks but I got a port implanted around their age and transfusions have gone so much easier. \n\nI would be happy to talk if they would like. Hope it all goes well! Thank you so much.\nI will let her know that she can speak with you. \ud83d\ude0a Thanks a lot for sharing! Can I ask what you work? I am a minor and am lucky to not get transfusions but I still get anxiety and depression from my Bipolar Disorder. I read this study that suggested Thalassemia patients tend to have a high comorbidity with mood disorders. \n\nI really struggle and usually force myself to exercise (which I feel better after). MORNINGS SUCK. I am trying to experiment with taking Methylfolate which is absorbed 10x better than just Folic acid. I also drink a lot of Black Tea and Coffee as I have heard, it can decrease absorption of Iron. If you can do that, the Iron will cause less oxidative damage which can relieve some symptoms. I am also on Psych meds, but once I receive Reblozyl, I will be so relieved. I have a government union position in Canada that has generous medical and leave benefits. What make you think you got bipolar disorder because the only one can assume that is the psychiatrist. \nAnd if you are minor and do not need transfusion why you will use REBLOZYL, I think is when hemoglobin is low than 11 g/l . I have symptoms of Bipolar that was discovered by my psychiatrist. \n\nWhy would I turn down that offer.

Hey there! I am also a beta thal major F. I am 22 but I only weigh 43-44kg, max weight i would get is 45kg and that is it ((even though I can eat A LOOOOT)). As for my height im only 156cm but I have come to terms with it already as thal can be a hindrance to growing-- it stuns growth if I understood it correctly as per what my doctors have told me. Looking at the brighter side, atleast you can eat plenty and never gain weight haha. I am alpha thal but I am 4\u201910\u201d and have been stuck at 92lbs for a long time. Sorry, I do not know the conversion to metric, but it is around 42kg I think. I believe having thal makes my metabolism faster and therefore I do not gain weight even though I eat a toooon on sweets and candy and I do not exercise. It also makes me have a higher tolerance to alcohol I think, since people my size cannot handle a lot, and I am Asian but I do not get the \u201cAsian glow\u201d. So it can be a good thing I guess. My advice for you if you want to gain weight is to work out and gain MUSCLE since muscle weighs more than fat, and it is also healthier. Good luck", "Help! I am so confused. Did they test me for both Alpha and Beta? Or just Alpha? Is a carrier the same thing as trait? My Sicilian grandfather was Beta (I thought). Why do I have Alpha?  From what I am seeing here, you were positive for alpha+ thalassemia, I also had thalassemia(alpha) since I came out of the womb. I am 17 now and am currently waiting for a transplant after high school. I wish you the best of luck! You are an alpha thalassemia minor ( carrier) of one gene. As for your health you are fine.

I also have another rare genetic disorder (Alport Syndrome) which I am not interested in passing along. I have Alpha Thalassemia minor as well and I am concerned of having children with Alpha major. I am going to have my spouse tested and see a genetic counselor next Monday about the issue. Hopefully not a big deal. Good luck! I hope everything turns out ok! As far as I know if you had beta it would have shown up in the hemoglobinopathy evaluation, since it did not I believe that is why they only DNA tested for alpha.

I have beta thalassemia... my Dr decided to put me on an iron supplement.... ever since going on the iron.... I crave ice!! To the point that I am going to the store once a week to get a bag of ice to chew on!! Any advice?? Suggestions?? That is weird that it started after taking iron?? I was addicted to chewing ice as a kid, and found out later that it is a sign of iron deficiency. I have beta minor and so does my son and we are both iron deficient. \n\nFrom my experience, the iron supplements are taking months to improve iron levels so there probably is not much you can do except keep taking it and wait. \n\nMy entire family thinks I am insane for going on iron with thalassemia but we are under the care of hematologists who insist it is fine and necessary. I have never been so confused about something in my life. \n\nIf we are prone to iron overload due to thalassemia why are we iron deficient? I am really curious myself if anyone can help explain that situation my understanding is that as red blood cells are produced they have a high failure / destruction rate.  Iron is required for red blood cell production, but also causes the iron from those destroyed cells to be filtered / trapped in the liver.   So in a way, we need more iron to keep up with that high production / failure rate, but that leads to build-up.\n\n\\*not a hematologist:  As always, talk to your doctor and trust the experts.

I dont drink... n I was just put on iron... which I take the low dose... since starting the iron... is when I started craving the ice!! Green leafy vegetables, watermelon, and eggs.\n\nChewing on ice is a sign of iron deficiency, and those foods all have high iron content. Feast, and your craving should subside. Supplemental iron and vitamins do not always absorb as well as dietary sources. So what can we do?? Should we eat iron rich foods or avoid them? Or is that going to harm us?? I am so confused and worried. One way or another, it is not a major issue, there is no need to fret.  I recommend moderation;  there is no need for iron supplements, generally avoid liver, but otherwise live your life.  Thal trait really is not a big deal.  I feel bad for Thal major ppl tho! Thank you. My parents never made this a big deal to me. They would just said I cannot ever take iron supplements and that I was anemic.

I have found that exercise is a bit of a balancing act, where too much causes hemolysis and too little increases depression. Finding a nice balance of some regular exercise will help increase your tolerance for activity and hopefully raise that hemoglobin a bit.\n\nFind a nice walking path, or set up a music playlist for a couple minutes each of pushups/situps/jumping jacks.

I have always suspected I have POTS.\n\nHave a good day! Migraines, swelling, body ache, dizziness, weakness (all unexplained, because minors are not supposed to have any symptoms). Do you mean that people with thalassemia often have these symptoms and doctors cannot explain it? Sorry just trying to clarify. I am only speaking for minors. Thal majors have a bigger set of issues. Oh I see. Yeah when my doctor told me that minors are asymptomatic I felt very skeptical. I am minor. They will all acknowledge the misshapen, small RBCs and irregular numbers. But these have no correlation with any of the symptoms because minors are supposed to be asymptomatic. I gave up and started avoiding heat and spicy food. That helps a bit. I have heard in Chinese medicine it is called having heat in the blood. I went to a Chinese acupuncturist and she knew what I had when I told her. I need to look into TCM more.

I do agree, to talk to the doctor or a specialist just to be sure specially if it is a confirmed diagnosis.\n\nIn my case, one of my kids was prescribed iron and we freaked out but in the end it helped him because he did not have thalassemia although we thought he did (we never ran a full blood analysis). One thing the doctor suggested is to monitor how he was feeling throughout and if he was not feeling well or continued to be anemic after the treatment then we would dig into a potential thalassemia diagnosis.\n\nIn the end a good doctor should be better advice than anything you find online, just make sure that the doctor understands what thal is since it is not too common.

She has not been to a doctor/ hematologist in a long time, and i am pushing her to go and see one ASAP.  that being said, for the time being, im just looking to get others input on how they manage this themselves.  more specifically the diet that they follow.  im a chef and i have a lot of experience, so id like to be able to apply that to making healthier, more exciting  food options for her.    ive been trying to look these things up online but for the most part all i find is a small list of foods that are generally okay to eat.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIve also been doing research and am finding all kinds of different articles talking about all the different things that contribute to the absorbtion rates of iron in the body, like hepcidin for example.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nreally i guess im just looking for some input from anyone here with how they regulate this in their own lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso, i apologize for my terrible grammar/ punctuation...lol  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to anyone who can help and have a wonderful day! Thal b-minor should probably have little impact on her life and little significance or clinical considerations.\n\n(She may have slightly less stamina than others and struggle a bit with aerobic exercise.)\n\nSome may have other advice but in general I would recommend cutting back on iron in her diet and avoid iron supplements.  Some providers detect a thal patient as anemic and recommend iron, do not let that happen as it can lead to chronic hepatic iron overload or acute issues such as a ruptured (spleen or appendix i cannot recall which).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides that, there is no real need to see a doc about it, she can even donate blood if her glucose is high enough that day (though it rarely will be). She definitely doesnt have minor then.    Ive been with her for 2 years and it definitely effects her more than what minor would.    \n\nThanks! Gotcha.  Of course, different people vary somewhat in how things effect them, but if it is more significant than that, yeah a talk with a doctor (specifically a genetic counselor) is a good idea.    Tell her that I said so and that should settle the matter.   :) Lol yeah.  She wants to talk to a doctor again and im very persistent on making her do this.  I think its important and i just want to help any way i can.   Thank you, i appreciate your input. She probably does have minor, but since symptoms are known to be mild and not classified beyond that it is hard for us to know what exactly the effects are. So it is very subjective. And beta thalassemia is a very genetically diverse type, so it is possible she could have a more severe minor form. If she is never required a transfusion then it is most definitely minor, but intermedia is still a possibility. \n\nAs far as treatment, I found a study on the effects of supplemental folic acid and L-carnitine, and it was shown to help the subjects, if only minimally. I only do the folic acid though. As far as food, I swear by Wheatgrass. It is the only thing that is ever actually improved my hemoglobin.  she needs to get an iron study to determine if she needs iron or has too much. It varies among bthal minors.\n\nOh and is she has not had a blood transfusion in the two years you have known her, then it is minor. Symptoms vary among us, some are less asymptomatic than others. Thank you! Perhaps it is minor then. Shes never had a transfusion.    There are just so many conflicting things ive read recently its pretty confusing lol. Interesting,  thank you!     Im really trying to figure out thr best foods for her to eat, and then to see what i can do to those foods for her to be it less boring aha.   But there are so many factors regarding iron intake and store that it started to get a bit confusing.      Shes never had a transfusion as far as i know.     Do you know if minor can switch to ntermedia/major over time/lack of care? No, it cannot change. And thalassemia is not an iron issue; it is a hemoglobin problem. It is actually misdiagnosed as iron-deficient microcytic anemia all the time (thalassemia is also a microcytic anemia, which means the mean corpuscular volume  of her red blood cells is less than 80), but iron supplementation does not help. Folate (B9) is used to make heme, so it could be beneficial. It is found in leafy green vegetables. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions. I just took my boards, so this is probably the most I will know about this stuff before my brain ejects it lol She avoids the leafy greens because of the iron.    So could she actually benefit from them? In theory, it should help with fatigue by boosting her RBC level. This is the study I am basing my 'treatment' off of:\n\n\n\nShe should not worry about the associated iron intake. Our bodies are actually really good at regulating iron - it sounds like you read about this a little, with ferritin, transferrin, TIBC, etc. - it is only when it is overrun, for example, like with supplementation, that we need to worry about side effects. She should get a CBC done soon though to make sure she does not have a more serious issue. Thank you so much.  I cant wait to share this with her. No problem! Side note, if you do use that study, I was not a fan of the carnitine. Made me kind of nauseous. If she does not have bone pain or weakness, I would not even bother. If she does, maybe start with a lower dose until she gets acclimated", "Cold hands and feet Hello peeps. Do you get cold hands and feet too? If so, how do you deal with it? Sorry for the dumb question, but I am honestly so over it. My hands and feet are always so cold, even if the rest of my body is not if that makes sense. Im not quite sure how to put it into words but I also feel really weak, especially when they suddenly go cold. \n\nAnd yes, I have tried gloves and fuzzy socks :( Your hands are cold because your system is using it is warmth to keep your vital organs warm (by constricting blood flow to your extemities).   I usually am my coldest after I eat.\n\nIdeas for when your hands and feet are cold.\n\nPocket hand warmers.  You can get disposable ones or ones that use lighter fluid or electricity. There are usb powered fingerless gloves that work like mini electric blankets.\n\nGet up and move. Get your circulation going and your hands and fingers will warm up. \n\nA warm shower or bath followed by throwing on those fuzzy socks immediately to keep the heat in.\n\nDrink and hold a warm beverage. This wil warm your core and your hands at the same time.\n\nA heating pad on low against your lower back for short intervals. If your core is warm your blood vessels will relax and let the warmth go to your hands and feet. Your reply is honestly so helpful, I did not know that targeting my core would help my hands and feet. Thank you for the tips and for dumbing it down for me- you really are the G.O.A.T :) Zippo makes two sizes of pocket warmers that are refillable and worth the investment. I just checked them out, they look so cool! I will definitely try them out! Thanks :)", "Are thal trait and thal minor still supposed to avoid iron supplements? I get that that thal majors sometimes can get blood transfusions, so may need to avoid supplements to prevent iron overload. But is the same true for thal minor/trait, or could an iron supplement actually help us?\n\nWould alpha vs beta make a difference in terms of avoiding iron supplements as well? \n\nAlso, what is the deal with folate/folic acid, and should it be taken across trait/minor/major and alpha/beta? I took iron vitamins only for 2 weeks because my dr said I need them, few days down the road I started feeling very bad . Had very high heart rate 150 just sitting around, felt dizzy and like fainting. My husband made me stop them because that was the only thing that I had changed, so we arrived to the conclusion that is the iron. After that I read that all the symptoms I had were do to the iron. Since then ,4 years, my resting heart rate never went back to normal 89-92 resting rate. So yeah before u take any supplements make sure u need them. I take iron supplements (a low dose). I have never heard of anyone that does because it is usually warned against, however my iron was really low which was causing all my hair to fall out. I have not had any problems since. It really depends which doctor you consult! Minors are not supposed to take iron, because our bodies cannot process it properly. Not being able to process it is the reason for our low iron, it is not a dietary deficiency that can be fixed by eating more.\n\nIron overload is dangerous. I am wary of iron rich foods, would never eat liver, for example.\n\nA bit of googling will quickly find lots of better explanations than mine. others are correct, avoid iron.\n\nI am a thal minor and have not taken iron supplements but do eat a fairly meat rich diet and have developed hepatic iron overload; there is really no treatment I am thal minor and while pregnant was  advised to double the recommended folic acid dose and start taking iron supplements, but I did not because of the comments I would read on this sub. Well... At 20 weeks pregnant I start getting severe migraines, and a slap on the wrist from my haematologist, they told me that it was safe for me to take the iron and to double the folic acid.\n\nMy blood count went from 8.0 up to 11.5 and the migraines stopped, infact I felt a whole lot better in general. Now I just take  regular multivitamin each day that does include iron, my blood count stays up around 12, and I feel great. \n\nEveryone is blood profile is individual, and I wish I would listened from the get go. I think In pregnancy it is a bit different. My hematologist had me take iron My daughter is beta thal minor, we have tried a few \u201cgentle natural\u201d iron supplements for her, but they make her feel very sick. I have the trait and I was told to stop taking iron as my anemia did not stem from my iron levels and never have (iron levels have been normal foe the past 10 years). I do take folic acid to help with RBC production. It all just depends on what your labs are. Wow.\nI was diagnosed with thal minor when I was I think 15 or 16. The doctor put me on iron supplements and never actually talked to me about what it was, nor did my mom. I was kind of young and did not understand what I looked up about it. \nThe supplements made me feel sick but I thought it was just constipation since i saw that could be a side effect and I stopped taking them for that reason.\nOver the years if I start having dizzy spells (The whole reason I went to the doctor in the first place) I will pop iron for a few days and go back to living life.\n\nI got prompted to look into thal minor more after a youtube video on \"Lack of energy\" suggested iron deficiency and I decided to see what other kinds of symptoms thal minor could have and that is what lead me to a few articles saying I should not take iron, and me searching thalassemia on reddit to find this page.\n\nI have not had health insurance long enough (tldr my life just is constantly hitting me with hurdles that force me to drop the job that gives it to me right before i can make an appointment/right as the insurance goes in effect. with covid it was especially hard to make an appointment before it dropped me soooo still there) to have a blood test since my teens. Last time I had anything remotely similar was when i was 19/20 and went to donate blood, my iron was almost too low to donate, and then I realized \"Oh crap maybe I actually should not donate\" and had to call them and let them know lmao. \n\n\nSo i guess...now my priority is getting insurance again so I can get my blood checked and talk to a doctor that will, yknow, actually talk to me about this lmao.

Due to the heavy iron overload I had to do chelation therapy. Actually I did not have thal beforehand. I got it transplanted from my stem cell donor. 400 is not that high...\nAre you taking regular blood transfusions? \n\nIf yes, that is a good level - keep taking your iron chelation. \n\nIf no, then please continue with green tea, and avoid too much red meat at once. You are in a safe spot! No I do not take blood transfusions. Thanks for your response! :)", "Iron deficient or Thalassemia? Hi :) I have recently been diagnosed with iron deficient anemia and hashimotos. I went to an endocrinologist today who thinks I have been misdiagnosed anemic and believes I have thalassemia. She recommended I stop taking iron supplements. My concern is that my ferritin is still low (14). The iron has raised my ferritin from 2 to 14, and my hemoglobin from 8 to 12.9. \n\nI will be seeing another doctor this week, just curious if anyone has insight into my labs or has similar numbers?

Well no worries my mother had it. I am fairly sure they do not, because both of my parents have health issues so they get blood tests frequently so they would have spotted it already if they did. Their doctor is not too great though (he did not see mine, I went to another doctor and she found it) so he might have missed theirs if they did have it though I am pretty sure it can skip generations. So even if your parents do not have it, your grand or great grandparents could Also my parents do not have it...but I am adopted lol A simple blood test would not be able to tell you if you are a carrier or not. Something like haemoglobin electrophoresis, or gene sequencing is your best bet. I know, but we found out that I had mine through a blood test because of how whacky my blood cells looked and how pale and not dense they were so if my parents had it, they would have found the same. Acttually that is impossible , if both of your parents do not have it you will not have too.\n so now if you have it and it has been inherited from one of your parent biological parents that for sure .\nFor me i think your real father is not who you think that he is your father that is simple maybe your mother got pregnant from another man who have this disorder which you got it by inheriting. But that will be sure if you completely know that both of your parents did not have that disorder. that is a bold claim... you can have random mutations that cause it too. How do you think it came about in the first place? Do not try telling me who is and is not my family. If anything I look exactly the same as my dad so you can sod off with that dumb assumption. I had blood work many times prior to diagnosis. They just figured I was anemic.

I workout 2-3 times a week via low impact cardio and weight training. \n\nThe fact that you can run several miles is very impressive. Not many of us can do that or at least I cannot.

My parents were never very \"health conscious\", I just recently found out my father has Thalassemia minor a few years ago. I am 27 now and have been struggling with chronic fatigue, depression, periodic limb movement disorder and low weight (extreme difficultly gaining weight/poor appetite) for my entire adult life. I wonder if the cause is related to the possibility that I inherited this disease. I always bring this up with my doctors nurse before each visit but they never address it, and I always forget to ask the doctor directly about it. I have only had normal blood tests done, nothing specialized. Well, besides getting some genetic testing done, an easy way to try to determine if you may have inherited thalassemia minor is to have your hemoglobin tested. If you have not already done that it is a normal blood test whose results take about five minutes to come back. From what I know (both my parents have minor) if you do have it then your hemoglobin should regularly be hovering around 10-11 instead of the usual 13-15. I have major and I am always between 8-10. If your hemoglobin comes back and is actually lower than normal then you should probably consult with your doctor about some genetic testing and see what the next steps are. \n\nHope this is helps! It is very possible that you inherited it. The good new is that if you did it should be pretty manageable if you have made it this far without serious complication. Also most doctors know very little about it if you want to engage a doctor about it you should be ready to have the basic information for them and allow them time to research it instead of putting them on the spot. Maybe ask if they could read up on it before your next appointment?  My father has T minor as well. After suffering fatigue and hair loss, I went to the doctor and after a couple of blood tests it was determined that I also have the trait. You should get it checked out regardless just so you know if you have it, and if you do and plan to have children you need to make sure your partner also does not have it. Was it a special type of blood test? Because I have had many regular blood panel tests in the past few years. What happened for me was after saying I had hair loss, the doctor did a full panel blood work. My iron was on the low end of normal, so while I was not deficient I was low. The lab suggested I do another test to determine whether it was genetic or diet related, so they tested my blood again and came back with a positive for the thalassemia trait. I am sorry I do not know exactly what was tested that is all I am aware of.  Thank you. I will remember to mention to my doctor the next time I see her to check for Thalassemia, I always tell them my father has the minor form of it but they only do normal blood work with me. I will ask if there is another one they can do to look specifically for it. Well it is important for you to know if you have it. If you had children with someone who also had thalassemia minor, your children would have a 25% chance of having thalassemia major. That is too big of a risk to take the chance! Also, people with thalassemia cannot give blood (in Canada, anyway) so it is something you should be aware of. ", "Cooley\u2019s Anemia Foundation Event this weekend ", "Is thalassemia curable?

Also I am on the iron supplements, should I immediately try to talk to another doctor to ask if I can continue taking iron or not? My family doc is unfortunately not available for couple of weeks.\n\nI had my blood tests due to anemia and low iron initially and just found out about this beta thalassemia minor which has put me in more stress now...\n\nThanks, What you describe sounds so very familiar, many of us here can relate.  A few points:\n\n\\-Talk to your doctor and trust professionals more than the internet, but get second opinions to be sure\n\n\\-Do not worry!  Beta Minor is not a big deal, many people have few if any symptoms.\n\n\\-I would recommend against iron supplements!  Yes, we are low on iron because our blood production is flawed and always working overtime, but that is okay.  The gotcha is that as our red blood cell production results in a lot of cell failure / destruction, all that iron is processed by our liver, and builds-up over time into what they call hepatic iron overload, a chronic liver condition with no real treatment. Thanks for clearing up.\n\nSo I just talked with my doctor on phone quickly and she said there is nothing to worry about thalassemia minor and keep taking iron also because according to her I have two conditions 1. Thalassemia minor, 2. Iron deficiency. Im on 150mg pill everyday. Just like you said i have read internet says do not take iron pills when you have thalassemia minor. Now this liver buildup thing is making me worried. \n\nI do have appointment in couple of weeks where I can discuss about this with my doctor. Would you suggest to talk about this with her in detail? I would recommend talking with her in detail about it, perhaps even a second opinion..  low iron comes with the territory with thalassemia.  I have had ct, mri, and biopsy of my liver to investigate the extent of iron overload Maybe get a second opinion or see if you can get referred to a hematologist. My daughter and my husband are both beta thal minor. Their blood work will always show them as anemic. My daughter\u2019s pediatrician mistakenly put her on iron supplements until she was 6 months old because we did not know she had it(also did not know my husband had it at the time) When we were referred to a hematologist, we were told that she should not be taking iron because she cannot use the excess iron and it could cause liver damage over time. Thanks. I will definitely try that and get a referral for hematologist to reassure myself. Low iron can mean anything. Transferrin saturation is the only reliable indicator besides microcytosis. I am a clinical laboratorian. Have you invedtigated vitamin e for thalassemia? I have done blood scan which says Hypochromasia present.  And HbA2 was 5.2% (high). \n\nTotal iron binding capacity was 75 umol/L. which says is normal in the report.\n\nIron saturation index is 0.07, while it says normal range is 0.12 - 0.60. So its low\n\nBlood iron level was 5 umol/L and Ferritin was 10ug/l (both indicated as LOW)\n\nNo I do not think I have gone through any Vitamin E tests yet. Ok my mistake this does support iron deficiency anemia. Could be concommitant b6 deficiency as well. Check out pubmed for vitamin e and thalassemia. Also important to rule out hypothyroidism. Thanks, I will check that. What worries me is internet everywhere suggests no iron supplements for thalassemia minor and even some papers I saw suggested low Iron diet. While my doctor still believes I need iron supplements. Can iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia coexist?\n\nEdit: i did have thyroid test and results were normal. Yes they can coexist, i normally disagree with doctors but in this case i agree, this is a very clear-cut case of iron deficiency. I would recommend a stool fecal occult blood test as well, just to cover all bases with regards to possible blood loss. Iron can be toxic and is vastly over-prescribed, especially the ferrous form. The best way to increase iron would be high-iron foods, especially liver. Then you get the b6 as well. Vitamin e, not only can be good against thalassemia, but it can also protect against the toxicity of iron, by preventing lipid peroxidation. \n\nThis is the best vitamin e on the market, you can dilute in in olive oil or coconut oil to make it more palatable \n\nMaybe keep hypothyroidism in your mind as a future possibility, there is an association with hypothyroidism and thalassemia. \n\nPlease let me know if I can be of assistance. &gt;\n\nHow much iron can be toxic if I am taking it daily? I have been prescribed a 150mg pill everyday. I was thinking I may reduce it and take it a couple of times a week just to be on safe side I am not sure it probably depends on various vactors. Citric acid increases absorbtion of iron but i feel the best sources are liver or red meat. Liver disgusts many people, you have to heavily season flour, dredge the liver in it, and then quick fry. However your couple times a week strategy seems logical you can take it with orange juice to increase absorbtion. In american units, once you reach 20-30% transferrin saturation that should be enough iron, but you also need b6, b12, and folic acid. If you have any other labs feel free to share them. All these nutrients are necessary for red cell production and b6 deficiency is an unrecognized cause of microcytosis. I think it is smart to only take the iron a few times a week. If your doctor will not order them, you may be able to order your own transferrin saturation test weekly or biweekly. May i ask what your tsh was also, if you has t3 and t4 tested, cholesterol? &amp;#x200B;\n\nMy TSH was 2.46 mU/L\t(normal range 0.20 - 4.00 mU/L)\n\nTriglycerides\t0.75 mmol/L\t        normal = 0.00 - 1.70 mmol/L\t  \nCholesterol, Total\t3.24 mmol/L\t  \nHDL Cholesterol\t0.72 mmol/L\t  \nLow Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (Calculated)\t 2.18 mmol/L\t  \n(Normal range 0.00 - 3.40 mmol/L)\n\n  \nNon High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol\t2.52 mmol/L\t  \n(normal range 0.00 - 4.20 mmol/L) And I have gone through colonoscopy and gastroscopy (upper endoscopy) as well where they took bunch of biopsy samples and everything came normal. Ah! Low cholesterol. Common also in thalassemia. \n\nYou are probably a bit hypothyroid. But try increasing saturated fat and sugar, decreasing unsaturated fat. See if you can get a test for SIBO. Increasing cholesterol will stabilize your red cells. Ok good. Ever had a SIBO test? No, never had SIBO test. \n\nHypothyroid: does that need attention? so I can discuss with my doctor when I meet.\n\nI have been permanently using psyllium husk, could this be the cause of low cholesterol? do not know much but it says on the bottle that it lowers cholesterol level... Yes that is possible that the psyllium could lower cholesterol you may want to switch to cooked wheat bran or raw arrot if you need a fiber. Unfortunately the psyllium husk can support bacterial growth and once the bacteria grows it can produce a toxin that the liver must eliminate therefore that can burden the liver however raw carrots or cooked wheat bran does not possess this property. If constipation is a problem cascara Sagrada is the safest as laxative. Ensuring a rapid digestion eases the burden on your liver. A SIBO test is a test to measure for bacterial overgrowth in the upper digestive tract. However it is not always accurate. But it could be a convenient place to start within the medical system \n\nLow cholesterol or hyporcholesterolemia is a neglected laboratory finding. And used to be that doctors would look at something called respiratory quotient to determine thyroid status however today unfortunately doctors rely on TSA. Normally a t s h / 1 is diagnostic for hypothyroidism however doctors will disagree. Some people import their own thyroid hormone to treat hypothyroidism however with your low cholesterol you would have to raise your cholesterol before you can start thyroid hormone because thyroid hormone lowers cholesterol by converting it to steroids in the mitochondria. I personally feel increasing your cholesterol should be a Paramount consideration and you could even delay the iron supplementation for the sake of your liver. I may consider supplementing vitamin B6 as p5p perhaps 10 mg a day. It may be possible to import antibiotics such as doxycycline which may help to clear out your gut and therefore ease the burden on your liver. Once your total reaches 160 mg per deciliter or even 150 mg per deciliter then you could consider thyroid supplementation. Some people import there on thyroid. I think increasing your total cholesterol would do much for your red cells stability. It sounds counterintuitive but increasing saturated fat and sugar especially fruit sugar and decreasing unsaturated fat should help to increase your cholesterol and therefore stabilize your red cells. As always please let me know if I can offer any more information. Also TSH exhibits what is called a diurnal variation meaning that its highest in the morning and decreases by the afternoon however again I do not think that you should treat any potential hypothyroidism until your cholesterol comes up. And last but not least I would recommend checking vitamin D. I do not know what the UK units are but it should be above 50 nanograms per milliliter. One last suggestion: coffee (with sugar of course). Good for the liver. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I just wonder why doctor took it very lightly... I am yet to meet in person and my doctor is pretty good for years but she just told me that you have thalassemia minor and iron deficiency and NOTHING to worry about. \n\nThis worries me in a way that there are many other things to consider other than iron itself. \n\nThanks for the details, I will give an update after I meet with my doctor. Honestly, your doctor may be one of the better ones, may care a lot, they simply are not given the information. Misunderstanding of cholesterol and the statin industry is one reason. Here is a paper on low cholesterol in general. I' always around feel free to hit me up. Best wishes for next visit. \n\n In my case no amount of iron will fix the deficiency, any improvement in iron levels is rapidly lost if I stop supplementation even for a short period. Long term non stop iron supplementation is not recommended\n\nIt is a losing battle imo", "Silent Carriers Alpha Thalassemia - Curious - What is your MCV &amp; MCH?

I think it is a great indicator with Family history as well! Which is why I am curious about other people commenting here.\n\nI am assuming your DNA testing said you are missing 2 genes correct? I am getting tested for a 2 gene deletion for confirmation but my hemoglobin is often 135-140 but is 125 rn and MCV is often between 70-80 and MCH is almost always 25 on the dot. My doctor has said that for 1-2 gene deletions the only way to confirm is by looking at DNA. Your doctor is  absolutely correct! This post is to see how accurate the indication works if DNA is not available. Please let me know what your gene deletion is when you get back the results. MCV 63\nMCH 20 Hemoglobin normal 145 rn\nMcv 62, MCH 27.3\n\nI am getting tested currently, and do  hypothesizes it is alpha thal with 1 missing. I e a weirdly addicted to eating ice for a few months, brought it up as a offhand comment which lead to blood work to check for iron deficiency. Over the next few weeks, they started leaning towards thalassemia. \n\nWeirdly, lost the pleasure from eating ice completely after I started the iron supplements. 68 mcv 21 mch \nJust got my test result today for alpha thal trait. Symptoms: presenting the usual anemia symptoms for the past few months. Chest discomfort. Tired. No drive to exercise/workout. Feeling the need to take deep breaths.", "Thalassemia minor, low hemoglobin, and elective surgery I am scheduled for a tonsillectomy in a few days and had my pre-op appointment and labs last week. I just got a call that my hemoglobin is low at 10.9. While on the phone they checked my last two years or so and I am pretty much always at 11-11.2. They said the surgeon would do the surgery but they would do some special thing to ensure they have my blood type in case I need a blood transfusion. Essentially I could bleed around 7-10 days post surgery and need re-cauterized and possibly a transfusion. I know that is a risk with tonsillectomies anyways but my risk is increased. The doctor said in the 20 years they have been practicing it is only happened once. I had my gallbladder out 8 years ago with no problems. I have had thalassemia minor my whole life and it usually only comes up when I have blood work. Now I am not sure if I should go through with the surgery. The tonsillectomy is not 100% necessary but I think it would improve my quality of life. I have really bad anxiety though and I do not know how I will handle the thought that something could go wrong at any time. I was already freaking out before this but also mentally prepared to go through with it. At 10.9 I would not be afraid to have surgery.  You do not need a transfusion until 7 or below and it takes a LOT of blood to go from a 10 to a 7.    \n\n\nAlso, the difference between 10.9 and 11.2 is not that much, and can be accounted for by either using a different lab or even if you are more or less hydrated when you get your blood drawn.  Even slight dehydration can cause your hemoglobin to test a little lower. I regularly stay at 9 and have had a couple surgeries. Thank you! Thanks! I appreciate the reply", "Beta Thal Minor? I have been super fatigued lately. Also have been taking zinc supplements without copper for the past year. So that may make it worse or be the cause. Just desperate for answers at this point.  It might be. Your doctor will do a full work up of your anemia, including iron studies and a blood film. If these come back unremarkable, you will have a test called hemoglobin electrophoresis which will help diagnose any abnormalities of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in your red cells. One of these abnormalities is beta thalassemia minor", "Is my chest hurting apart of thalassemia? Well I was born with thalassemia..but I never really thought much of it...I am currently 15 turning 16 this year and I have noticed that as years have gone by my chest has been hurting out of no where for what seems to be like no reason. It prevented me from staying with my baseball team because it hurt so much I could not stand up straight and I did not want to hinder the team longer. I have told my parents and they told me to brush it off that I was imagining things and it has been hurting during tests or in PE. Even while Im casually walking with a friend.Lately it does not happen as much but I am wondering if it is because I was born with thalassemia. I am sorry to disturb anyone. Is it made worse by breathing hard, running, just taking too deep of a breath?  Is it more near your heart, or rib cage? It is probably not Thalassemia related and more likely growing pain; do you get an annual physical with blood work? Definitely could not hurt to have your numbers looked at. If your hemoglobin/o2 was down, though, there would be a lot more going on than intermittent chest pain. You are not bothering anyone by asking. Have you ever had an echocardiogram? It is like an ultrasound but for your heart. My doctor ordered one for me for some reason so I think it is related to thalassemia. Sometimes my chest randomly hurts kind of over my heart, and I had a heart murmur when I was little I think. Talk to your doctor about it. It could be something that needs to be looked at. It is made worse by running and it feels like it is close to my heart but it may be my rib cage. Yes I do,but thank you I will have it looked at soon. Im grateful for your help I will definitely check to see if my hemoglobin/o2 is down. Yes I have had one a few years ago as well and I believe there was some sputtering from one of the valves. But I definitely will talk to my doctor about it , thank you for the help I greatly appreciate it. Hopefully it is something not bad. When I hit puberty, I too started to have chest pains. I been diagnosed since birth (1981) and TDT. My chest pains was due to the large amount of cardiac iron and free iron in my body. I was transfused a lot and chelating not as much. Chelation, Chelation, Chelation! is the key to lessen the damage Thal and iron can do to our organ. Do not forget to get your yearly echo and mri, it will show the frequencies of many variations of blood flow. Sad to say, the chest pains does not subside, it gets worst and harder to breathe when you are my age. Then the back pains and swollen body parts. Yippee for us! But you will find ways to cope with it. For me drink water, deep breath and lay down. Also, Congratulations you have reached an age that decades ago seem impossible for thalassemia. Be proud to be alive! You are not a bothersome, stay positive.", "Beef Liver? I remember someone mentioning they felt good after eating liver. I cannot eat it but I am about to order the capsules to see if it helps. The reviews of them are some of the highest I have seen on Amazon, and they all seem legit. Were you looking at the Ancestral Supplements brand? I am curious about this too. Yes I was! I am going to order them today I think. Please post a review once you have tried them. Will do. They are coming sometime next week. I cannot tell I have got much from Ancestral Supplement's liver capsules but it may be different for others. What I can attest to however is that real beef liver works wonders for me. I get it sliced from grocery store (but better to get from farmer's market) and fry it in coconut oil. Tastes amazing! Beef liver and eggs is going to be my breakfast of choice for now. Have you had the chance to try them yet? Yes I have been taking them and really have not noticed a difference. I would say it is a skip! Well darn!", "Thalassemia Beta-Intermedia and exhaustion Does anyone know of anything to help with the constant physical exhaustion? \n\nI have to say it sucks. Besides vitamins and supplements and light exercise, not really. \ud83d\ude11 Yeah I have noticed it getting worse with the less exercise I do. Unfortunately (perhaps relatedly?) I also have unbearable back pain. I am just starting PT though...maybe it will help. Apart from symptoms, is intermedia genetically closer to minor or major? Thanks I do not know for sure but I *think* it is just a more severe form of minor. \n\nI am sorry I do not have better information for you right now. Thanks Are you being transfused? As a \u201cformer\u201d intermedia who was never transfused (35 years old) - I only recently started transfusions and feel a lot better. When I was younger I had decent energy but in the last 6 years I felt 15 years older than I should have. With regular transfusions I feel much better. Current research shows that intermedia should be treated as a major. There are more benefits to transfusions than not, especially with progress in iron chelator medication. I have never had any transfusions but that is something I can look into. Should I just talk to my doctor about it?  \n\nI am a little concerned that I just will not be able to afford them. Talk to a thalassemia specialist about this. There are risks that come with not transfusing intermedias. I was never transfused until I developed significant complications last year \u2014 extramedullary haematopoeisis resulting in spinal compression and also a pleural effusion caused by the same. \n\nIntermedia is only a clinical classification, it is really just a slightly milder major. The old way of treating intermedias was to avoid transfusion and possibly undergo splenectomy but with advancement in iron chelation therapy there is little reason to suffer as an intermedia. I only wish I had known this earlier, I would have been healthier today. The difference in my health 6 months ago to now is significant since undergoing transfusions.\n\nI do not know what expenses you would encounter - here in Australia it is all covered by the medical system, even the iron chelator medicine (Jadenu). Maybe talk to the local thalassemia society wherever you are located?\n\nAgain - strongly advise getting a second, third, fourth opinion if doctors keep insisting you do not need transfusion. Any update on how you dealing with the physical tiredness  And back pain ? No improvement. I actually had to rush to ER Sunday for chest pain and super racing heart that the doctor said was likely caused, or exasperated, by the Thalassemia. \n\nI have an injection scheduled for Thursday that should help (for a while) with back pain though so that is encouraging. \n\nThanks for asking! I pray that it goes well for you :) what is your current HB level ? I do not know how to test that. Is there like a tool?\n\nI am fairly knew at this management aspect, growing up it was just kind of shrugged at. Haemoglobin is detected through blood test similar thing happened with me when my hb was around 9\n\nNormal HB level for our age group is 13-16 I will have to get tested!", "I tried so hard! Hoping to make a real difference in this world, I spent 5-months going through the process to donate my liver to someone in need.  I took every test, more than 100 blood tests, CT, MRI, EKG, ultrasound, biopsy, stress test, urine, \\*everything\\*.   At the last minute they determined that they were not \"comfortable\" proceeding due to my thal.    It frigging sucks, someone died because of that and it is so awful. You were going to organ donate your own liver? You tried, but the decision is ultimately up to the doctors..if the patient had the surgery, and did not survive or got worse after a transplant, the doctors couldve been in trouble that they allowed the procedure to go forward knowing of any potential issues (per what I recall from my knowledge in this topic). It is a tough call to make. For the question about donating a liver - it is possible to donate part of one\u2019s liver, since the liver is the only organ that can self-generate. ...perhaps.  you are right in that it is certainly not my call to make, though the recipient could be given the choice perhaps, they are facing death anyway. well, 1/2 of it.  It would grow back over time. Well, it is an ethical thing, I tend to agree it is a conundrum. Do no harm and all that. Liver transplant is major surgery and there is a risk of death in people without thalassemia, so the thalassemia is an additional risk. I cannot say what is the best thing to do, but I can recognize where the dilemma is.\n\nAlthough, if they explained the risk correctly and you were okay with it, it would pretty much cover the ethics of it.\n\nBut in the end if there was not a surgeon willing to take the hit on their stats if anything went wrong, there is nothing you can do about it. Let go of things you cannot control. You did your best, more than others would be willing to do.", "Chronic Hemolysis in Beta Thalassemia Minor? Hi,\n\nI got diagnosed with beta Thal Minor recently.\n\nMy blood test showed signs of pathological Hemolysis:\n\n* High Bilirubine levels (&gt;79\u00b5mol/L on multiple dates, fasted and not)\n* Low Haptoglobine (&lt;0.08g/L)\n* High reticulocytes (95Giga/l 1.45%)\n\nCurrently waiting for G6PD, Pyruvate Kinase and Coombs test.\n\nWe also found slight Splenomegaly, and my doctor said he doubts its beta thal related.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think guys, **are these results beta Thal Minor related or not?** High Bilirubine + Splenomegaly let me assume it could be a thalassemia intermedia. \nYou could check you Fetal hemoglobin and see if it is high. \nAlso what is your hemoglobin level ? Minor is often in the 11ish g/dL while it is around 8-11 for intermedia if I remember correctly. \nTake care. Thank you for your response, kind person.\n\nHemoglobine level is in 12.6 - 13.2 range\n\nHPLC showed:  Hb F at 1.6% which is slightly high (HbA2 at 5.4%  and HbA at 93%) I have an enlarged spleen too, and my doctor said it is caused by alpha thalassemia That is actually good hemoglobin level, in the low range but still normal. \nHonestly, beta thalassemia minor is a fair diagnosis. The high bilirubin could comme from something totally different (Gilbert Syndrome for exemple which is 100 benign) or be related to the thalassemia (this disease really materialises differently for each person) \n\nI would not worry too much if I were you, you can have a totally normal life. \nTake care. \n\nPS : English is not my first language, maybe Gilbert Syndrome is only called that in French haha. You should check :) Yes, high bilirubine can be caused by Gilbert's syndrome. But I do not think that low haptoglobine is coherent with it.\n\nI will be waiting for the extra tests and see what the hematologist has to say.\n\nThank you for the responses, have a great day ! Thank you for the response.\n\nYes, I guess it is also caused by the beta thalassemia in my case. Can I ask what the high fetal hemoglobin means?\n\nMine is 14.4 (it says the range is &lt; 2.0%) and my Hemoglobin A2 is low normal (2.2%, and the normal range is 1.8 to 3.5%). The hemoglobinopathey says high F thalassemia, but does not go into more detail as to what that means, and the hematologist didnt really know.

I do not know the scientific difference, but all I know is alpha thal is less severe than beta thal. I do not know the major vs minor either since I never heard of it until I looked online and people said major and minor. Beta (major?) usually has to get blood transfusions every 3 weeks whereas alpha (major?) only has to have blood transfusion when a virus or something affects the immune system and causes the hemoglobin levels too drop too low", "What does this bloodwork result mean? I recently went in for prenatal bloodwork and got this result. I am Chinese/Vietnamese descent and dad was a thalassemia carrier (not sure if it was Alpha or Beta). What does it mean?\n\n\u201cHemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis at alkaline pH shows 2 Hb bands with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to A, A2.No abnormal hemoglobins detected.  One or two gene deletion alpha thalassemia cannot be excluded since these conditions are not associated with abnormal findings on routine hemoglobin elecrophoresis and except for mild microcytosis, are generally not associated with other hematologic abnormalities.This interpretation of hemoglobin electrophoresis results is based on the presumption that this patient has not been recently transfused with red blood cells.\u201d I am not a doctor but just reading this it sounds like they are saying they cannot say you do not have it, because it would not show up on the hb electrophoresis as an abnormality. They are saying you do not have any abnormality in your hemoglobin, but it does not mean you do not carry the alpha thalassemia trait. One or two gene deletions cannot be excluded: if you have 1 deletion you will be a silent carrier with no symptoms, 2 deletions is still generally without symptoms but could cause small blood cells. Sounds like you may have only 1 deletion if your hemoglobin is normal. So that should be good news! \n\nIf I am wrong I am sorry! I do not know much about alpha thal I have beta thal. Your dad must be an alpha carrier (I think that is more common than beta with your ancestry as well). And you say you are doing prenatal testing.. I have passed beta thal trait to 2/3 of my kids and they will need to make sure they do not have children with anyone who also carries the trait. My youngest has really small blood cells and anemia but other than that everyone is healthy. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can only pick up beta thalassemia and other beta chain abnormalities like sickle cell and hemoglobin C.\n\nAlpha thalassemia cannot be detected with a hemoglobin electrophoresis. It would be important to check which type of thalassemia your dad has.\n\nIf he is a beta thalassemia carrier, this result would mean that you did not inherit the trait. If he was an alpha thalassemia carrier, you may need a genetic test to determine your carrier status. Some individuals are double gene deletion carriers for alpha Thal and typically those people have anemia (low MCV). Some individuals only have one gene deletion and may have a normal MCV. \n\nIf you are a silent carrier for alpha thalassemia (one gene deletion) vs a double gene deletion carrier, risks to your baby may be different depending on partners carrier status.", "Tennis Champion Sampras Suffers From Thalassemia ", "Recently diagnosed, but no treatment discussion? I was diagnosed with thalassemia last summer while having issues with a high heart rate that was only attributed to anxiety, according to doctors. My MCV, Mean corpus HgB, and RBC are consistently low. I never knew why, and decided to ask because I thought maybe that was a problem. The doctor asked me my ethnicity. My father is Thai, but I look 100% white, so I guess that is why they never asked?Then they told me I had thalassemia. That was pretty much it. It is never been brought up again and no one seems worried about it. Should I be asking for treatment for this? Could it be causing my chest pain and high/irregular heart rate or is it truly anxiety? I am not a medical doctor but that seems very unlikely. You may become/are slightly anemic, you may get easily tired but other than that that is really all there is to it unless you had major but that is unlikely if you are just finding out. \n\nYou have had this for the entirety of your life, you are just just now finding out. I hope that brings you a little bit of peace. \n\nThe most extreme \"treatment\" I have had personally were iron infusions during pregnancy and now post because I choose too and that is to treat the low iron that was caused by the thalassemia.\n\nNow things to definitely consider are:\n\n1. Before you have children, consider genetic testing with your partner. Thalassemia minor is mostly considered a trait not necessarily the disease. If you and your partner have it, it could be detrimental to your children.\n\n2. Consider a diet change if you feel unwell. Eat less red meat and more green leafy veggies. \n\n3. If you are a woman, be sure to have your ferritin checked if you become pregnant and you will probably also need to take folic acid.\n\n4. If you are prone to diabetes, for reasons unknown to myself,  thalassemia lowers A1C numbers, so having a good a1c reading would not be enough to give you the clear.\n\n5. Depending on how low your numbers, you may never be able to donate blood Thanks so much for your detailed reply, I wish my doctor had explained this to me. I do have one child, I am not sure if she inherited thalassemia from me or not. I did take folic acid during pregnancy but I am unsure if my ferritin levels were checked. I will make sure to keep these things in mind if I have another and to talk to my daughter\u2019s doctor about it. I am prone to diabetes (it runs rampant on my mother\u2019s side) so that is very good to know. Glad to help. If you want detailed information from a doctor I highly suggest asking your primary care provider for a referral to a hemotologist that can answer all of your questions and monitor your blood work over time. Many general practitioners are unfamiliar with the ins and outs of thalassemia so definitely make sure to advocate for yourself.\n\nBest of luck I recently met with a hematologist as I was told the same thing from my GP. If nothing else, I was at least validated that these symptoms some of us experience are def not just in our head. I struggle with fatigue and endurance mostly. I do not have kids, but was told that I should meet with a genetic counselor if I were to have them. The hematologist also said that taking 1mg of folic acid is completely appropriate as that aids in red blood cell formation. I am glad I asked for the referral and was taken seriously.

Hi everyone, i am wondering if you guys often have trouble when getting blood tests done because theres trouble finding a good vein. my sister and myself both experience this (both beta thal minor) No I do not have trouble when getting blood tests done. They always tell me that I have really good veins in my arms that they can see and poke easily. The only time I had trouble was one time in the hospital when the nurse use my forearm instead of my inner elbow, and she hit a valve and the needle got pushed out again. Yes! It sucks when they have to redo it multiple times. Now whenever I go for blood work, I let them know in advance that I have small veins. It works out better when they draw blood from a hand vein.  Nope and this is not something that is determined by your thal some people just have more prominant veins than others. Ugh yes i have some really crappy veins. I have had Beta Thalassemia Major since I was born and I am nearly 22 now. They have been getting used for nearly 22 years now and sometimes they randomly start hurting.\ud83d\ude2d My veins are now pretty thin and you cannot really see them because they are pretty bruised up and the marks do not go away. Since I am on monthly blood transfusions u can only imagine what that is like along with the cross matches.\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Very much, at my age of nearly 30 years the pain seems unbearable, though I have really visible and thick veins but due to repeated pricks for so many years I have developed thrombosis on nearly every vein of my arm, because of this the needles get countered on occasions and in that case I need to have my transfusions from the veins in my foot which stings like crazy. Am looking towards options like central and PICC line. Ohh I feel you bro, I feel you so much.!!! I am a major too and my situation is exactly the same as yours! I am scared everytime I have to go for a transfusion!!!\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d It is so sad tbh. Right now my veins are soo bad that I am considering a port/portacath. Its tough getting that because there are complications with it. My little sister has it and it is a nightmare when complications arise. It is a lose lose situation either way. \ud83d\ude2d It is actually making me very depressed and frustrated everytime a phlebotomist makes a comment about how crappy my veins are or how much scar tissue there is. It is both my hands and arms \ud83d\ude2d. Hopefully we get through this together. I am hoping it is not too bad for you. \ud83e\udd7a", "Since tea was suggested to help reduce iron intake, I made this post in r/tea! I hope this is helpful :)  Thank you. This is why I like Reddit Same lol Tea is good for your body but must make sure you do not start trying to drink anything like milk tea or Chai as it can do mild damage to your liver \n\n\n\n\n(Speaking from past experience my bilirubin shot up to 5.2 cause I got addicted to chai and coffee. )", "Staying fit with thalassemia I was diagnosed a while ago, but the doctor who did so did not really give me any information about my condition at all and was strangely dismissive about it, I am not even sure what type outside of \"not severe enough to need blood transfusions.\" Suddenly my extreme fatigue and terrible reaction to iron supplements make sense.\n\nMy main question, though, is how do you balance standard human exercise needs with a condition that makes moving so terrible and draining? For most of my life my solution has been to move as little as possible to avoid tiring myself out but that is not exactly healthy or sustainable in the long term. I have started making an effort to exercise in the past few years but it feels like an uphill battle. Even when I was walking 40min - 1hr every weekday for 6+ months, it never felt like it got any easier or I made any progress with strength or stamina. Does anyone have any experience/advice they could share with me? Make sure you are eating iron rich foods. I always feel better when I make sure I am getting the right amount of iron in my diet. And just know that some days are going to be harder than others and that is ok. I always feel better mentally after a walk even if I struggle to get started, so I try to keep that in mind that even tho it is exhausting, I feel better afterwards. I did the same thing in my early 20\u2019s. I stopped exercising and caved in to thalassemia, and that was definitely a bad idea. I gained a ton of weight and that did not help at all with my thalassemia as it made me feel even more fatigued. In my later 20\u2019s I decided to force myself to get back in shape. I ended up losing about 45 lbs, started a strength training routine, and then I started feeling so much better.\n\nNow I am almost 35, and I feel the best I have ever felt in my life. I am also in the best shape of my life and I focus a lot on what I put in my body and what I do with it. I make sure to spend at least an hour a day either lifting weights or skateboarding, but I push myself to make sure I do some sort of daily activity. \n\nNow, if I skip working out for even a few days the fatigue starts to creep in, and I immediately regret it. It was extremely difficult at first to get over the initial fatigue brought on by the thalassemia, but eventually, as you build up cardiovascular strength, you will feel amazing and the fatigue becomes a distant memory. Just push yourself and hold yourself accountable! You will start feeling way better in a few weeks time!\n\nEdit: I also recommend more strength training than cardio for thalassemia. I had the same issues with walking/running that you did where you just do not seem to lose the fatigue even after months of doing it. Strength training helped a ton because a total body workout improves how your muscles utilize oxygen where as running only focuses on training the lungs and heart which does not really help us with thalassemia since it is our entire body that suffers from the lack of oxygen. 45 lbs is the weight of about 496.55 'Kingston 120GB Q500 SATA3 2.5 Solid State Drives' I am not quite sure about the iron though. Thalassemia trait is known to lead in a surplus of iron, hence the chelation treatment needed in some cases (especially when blood transfusions are involved). Bad bot I agree! I started rock climbing a few years ago, and gained strength and muscle through that. It has helped me feel a lot better and less tired. I also make sure to listen to my body and push only a little bit at a time. \n\nI personally also walk a lot (I hate running) and used to bike quite a bit. My stamina is definitely lower than the average person with normal hemoglobin, but it definitely improves with consistency. Regular gentle exercise like daily walks (at least 45 min) and climbing (2-3x week) have both helped my pre-transfusion hemoglobin and my overall energy levels, not to mention my mental health. Now that you have said it, it makes total sense that the benefits from cardio would be limited by the nature of the condition itself. This is the exact kind of insight I was hoping for when I asked my question, thank you for sharing your experience. It was extremely discouraging to put so much time into walking and still struggle, it is a huge relief to learn this is an issue of \"focused on the wrong type of exercise\" and not \"exercise is impossible.\" I think it is different between men and women. Because women lose blood through their periods they can go low in iron. I have always found the iron thing confusing. Yeah actually what you heard is true but that is for major and intermidia not for minors as in mjors there is already huge iron overload due to blood transfusion and in intermedia the body has an exponentially higher iron absorption rate from food, as far as minors are considered that is not a cause of worry.\n\nThough if you ask me OP should try it out himself and see if it suits him as it is bound differ from person to person. I feel you on this one. I am not out of shape, but I used to get so tired and out of breath feeling, I thought there was something wrong with me.", "\u03b2-Thalassemia major and its effect on amino acid metabolism and growth in patients in the United Arab Emirates &gt; **BACKGROUND:**\n&gt; There may be a marked reduction in essential amino acids in the serum of children with thalassemia major and this is related to decreased growth in affected children.\n\n&gt; **METHODS:**\n&gt; One hundred patients with beta-thalassemia and 50 control children selected from among those who had presented with minor disorders unrelated to hematological disease were recruited. Urine and heparinized blood were collected from fasting thalassemic patients. After deproteinization and dilution, amino acid concentrations were measured using ion-exchange chromatography.\n\n&gt; **RESULTS:**\n&gt; Isoleucine (p&lt;0.0001), phenylalanine (p&lt;0.05), tyrosine (p&lt;0.0001), taurine (p&lt;0.0001) and glutamine (p&lt;0.01) were significantly decreased in the plasma of thalassemic patients compared to the control group. Whereas glutamate (p&lt;0.0001), serine (p&lt;0.05) and proline (p&lt;0.05) were significantly higher in thalassemic patients, threonine, glycine, alanine, valine, methionine, leucine, ornithine, lysine, histidine and arginine values were not different. The essential amino acids taurine (p&lt;0.0001), methionine (p&lt;0.01), valine (p&lt;0.01), phenylalanine (p&lt;0.01) and leucine (p&lt;0.05) were significantly decreased in urine of thalassemic patients vs. controls, but threonine and ornithine were not different. The mean urinary excretion rate of beta-aminoisobutyric acid was not different (69+/-96 in thalassemics vs. 41+/-52 in controls). However, most plasma and urinary essential amino acids were found to be lower in thalassemics. Thalassemic patients were also found to be significantly growth impaired for age, both in height and weight compared to controls.\n\n&gt; **CONCLUSION:**\n&gt; Lower plasma values of essential amino acids and a decrease in urinary amino acids occur in thalassemic patients. Growth impairment both in height and weight also occurs in thalassemic patients compared to a control population.\n\n\n\nHere are the actual amino acid measurements from the full paper:\n\n* (\n* (", "Restless legs?

But I am talking two 2500mcg pills daily. I love the Target brand Up cherry flavored ones, and they are so cheap! I just switched to methyl b-12; I hope this works just a well. If not, I will go back to the lozenges. Yes RLS is a real thing for thal patients.  Always happens more at night.", "Can Thalassemia minors donate blood? Just curious. My doctor said never ever That is interesting. My doctors said have said that it is perfectly fine if your own iron levels are okay. The blood itself is fine, it is just your own health that they are concerned about. I have donated many times. Yeah he did not say no because of a health risk to others it was no for my own health. I did once and felt like shit. Would not recommend. I think it depends on your hemoglobin levels being above a certain value, which they should test for.\n\nWish I could help out my Rh- homies by donating more consistently. I think opinions vary but my doctors have always advised against it. Part of it for me is that my hemoglobin count has never been within the range that allows for donation.  \n\nI had a doctor explain to me that my blood is not very useful to others. Our bodies are used to our small mishapen red blood cells whereas a person without Thalassemia is not. Additionally I was told that donating blood would put too much stress on our bone marrow. Our marrow is already hard at work trying to keep up with production as our RBC as it is without the added stress of trying to replace what we donated.\n\nAs for marrow donation that is a huge no. You still have low levels of hemoglobins, why lower them even more? I read that your hemoglobin must be over 12.5 in most countries to be able to donate blood. If you are a thal minor, you can donate marrow as long as you are okay and are fit to donate. \n\nFun fact: If you donate marrow, the person that receives your bone marrow will become a thal minor as well. Note that he cannot pass it on to his kids due to still carrying his old DNA everywhere else. My doc said it causes too much stress on the bone marrow.", "Do they use bone marrow transplants for alpha thalassemia, specifically the HbH variant? Used to have Hemoglobin H disease (which is basially alpha thalassemia intermedia) until I got a bone marrow transplant to get rid of monthly transfusions. \n\nI had been fine until age 10 although was slow to gain weight and grow. I had been taking folic acid to help me out. When I was 10, I got sick for two months and had to get two transfusions because my Hb dropped to 5.9. From that point on, I started monthly transfusions to grow and improve my immune system.\n\nThen comes 2014. We talked about the possibility of a transplant to help me get off transfusions. I had still been doing extremely well at that point so my parents decided to wait a few years. In 2017, I got the transplant from my matched sibling and am doing great.\n\nThey usually do not recommend transplants but my thalassemia had been so severe that it was recommended to avoid the potential late complications of staying on transfusions.", "Beta T immune to covid19? I learnt from my doctor and I am hearing more research that beta T people are immune to covid19 or atleast get less severe symptoms? There is some research in nih discussing the possibility. For example beta T is immune to malaria \n\nanyone still get covid dispite being beta T ? There are few people here including me who had severe backlash due to covid and required hospitalization for a week or two, am a thal major and as far as I know, none of the tree Beta thal types are malaria immune I think you read that about Sickle Cell Anemia another Hemoglobinopathy. Thanks for your answer, I guess we are not immune then I wish we were though, would have quite a nice change haha. \n\n\n\nLooks like there have been a couple preliminary studies that show some link. Thalassemia is also protective against malaria, but that is been established for a while. \n\nThis just goes to show you that you should do your own research and not believe what one person says. That Is a bunch of bull. I know about a dozen thal patients, mostly beta thal major who got covid and had fairly bad symptoms. I myself caught it after getting vaxxed. No symptoms from covid, but I did get fever, aching, etc after both shots of the vax. So I can imagine at least the same or worse had I gotten covid while unvaxxed. Interesting thanks for sharing This comment from one of the researchers \n\n\u201cif you are a beta-thalassemic minor trait, according to our study, you are a lower risk from COVID-19.\u201d \n\nI do not know if this means immunity or just lower side effects. Atleast Death rate is significantly lower as per the study They specifically said \"beta-thalassemic heterozygote population\" in one of the studies, so major may not offer the same resistance. Also, this is still in the speculation phase of research. I had COVID19 and I have Beta Thalassemia Intermedia, so that is definitely not true. I will say that even though I am severely immunocompromised, I did not get as sick as my husband who has asthma got. I did have to be hospitalized, but that is because the COVID19 triggered a hemolytic crisis and therefore, my hemoglobin dropped as did my oxygen levels which made it hard for me to breathe. Luckily I did not have to be placed on a ventilator or anything. I think people with inherited hemoglobinopathies like Beta Thalassemia are resistant to a lot of viruses (not just malaria). And even when we get sick, the virus cannot really fester and spread the way they normally do because our cells break apart (goes through hemolysis) whenever they get exposed to elevated oxidative stress. So when I was hospitalized for COVID19, I was treated with steroids, IV fluids, oxygen, and a plasma transfusion. This is my usual hemolytic crisis protocol. When I got discharged I continued with the steroids, and added allergy meds, nebulizer treatments, supplements, a Z pack, and Oxycodone because my ribs/stomach hurt from the coughing fits. Well your experience possibly shows \u201csome\u201d level of immunity and I think that is what the study is trying to explain, that the \u201crisk\u201d is lower, rather than claiming full immunity. \n\nHopefully more studies are done, would be interesting to know definitively! I agree. Again, I think people with inherited hemoglobinopathies, are resistant to more than just Malaria. I rarely get sick and when I do, it does not last long. It is never really the infection itself that affects me. It is usually the hemolytic crisis that affects me more. When I acquired sepsis during a hospitalization for a severe hemolytic crisis, I was the only patient who had it that survived. I think it is because I have Beta Thalassemia and G6PD Enzyme Deficiency, which both cause hemolytic crises during infections and IMO prevents infections from festering. I also think this is why I have never had Chicken Pox even though I have been exposed to it countless times and actively tried to get it per my doctor's advise before I started having kids. My sister had it, and the Mumps as did a lot of kids in our neighborhood, but my brother and I did not. My sister does not have Beta Thalassemia or G6PD Enzyme Deficiency, but my brother and I have both. I would love to participate in further studies about this topic.", "New diagnosis - alpha thalassemia Hi all, \n\nI (34F) was told today by my doc I have got alpha thalassemia.

All my vitamin levels are coming back as normal at the moment and I take regular multivitamin, vitamin C and vitamin D supplements. \n\nAny advice and insight would be much appreciated? I also have alpha thalassemia. I have written an in depth post on this sub about my experience with it.

Also asking the poster or anyone that wants to answer! My WBC is within range...on the low side of the range, but barely still within range. You are welcome! My Iron is in the normal range at the minute.  Think that is what finally twigged with the doctors because my MCH and MCHC were still low.  Heading on over myself.", "I am new to this...and I am quite frankly really scared. Hi everyone, I was recently told that I might have thalassemia because of the lab results that I consistently have whenever I get my blood work done. I have already experienced chronic pain, gastritis and carditis along with a heart murmur, and since I have consistent lab work that goes unexplained we are planning to run more tests in about a year.\n\nHonestly, I have a friend who has moderately severe thalassemia and I can only imagine how much pain she must be in and how much of a struggle her life has become to work with the condition. Because of this, I am pretty scared that I might have thalassemia and not know of it yet and I honestly cannot stop thinking about it. If anyone would help quell my fears just a little bit, or at least tell me outright that I most likely have thalassemia, I would be really appreciative.\n\nWhat is led my doctors and I to believe I might have it is the fact that I have recently developed anemia, but my numbers are not consistent with iron deficiency anemia or thalassemia per say. I have done like thousands of hours of research and barely gotten any sleep because I have been so worried, and I have found that there is something known as a Mentor index where you calculate the MCV/RBC size and if its less than 13 you are more likely to have thalassemia and if its more than 13, you are more likely to be iron-deficient.\n\nAt first I thought I was iron-deficient, but that does not make sense considering the fact that I have high RBCs; because both thalassemia and iron deficiency have low MCV, this was not an indicator that I used to differentiate between the two. In addition, I have passed out a few times over the years and I have grown weaker and weaker as well. My nails are brittle and it seems like I am always tired and lightheaded with normal things that I used to be able to do with no difficulty.\n\nBecause my condition has progressively gotten worse, I was not sure if I had thalassemia but my Mentor index is 11.130 (rounded), my RBCs are high and my MCV is pretty low in the 60s. Can anyone tell me if there is any definite answer to whether I am more inclined to have thalassemia or not? Your responses would be greatly appreciated and even if its terrible news, its better than no news. Thank you for at the very least reading what I have to say, and to anyone who currently has thalassemia or is also unsure of their condition, my heart goes out to you. There is no reason to panic.  Really.  First off what type do you have alpha or beta.  I am going to assume you have minor because if you had major you would have known all your life as it comes with a lot of issues. If you had intermedia it would have come up too.\n\nFirst, I have to tell you that thalassemia is not like sickle cell in that i does not cause pain, especially the minor types.  I have known I have beta minor most of my life with varying degrees of severity (in most cases thalassemia minor has no symptoms), and it has never once caused me any issues other than heart palpitations, fatigue, and the typical symptoms of anemia.\n\nThalassemia minor, while irritating, is no huge hardship and nothing to panic about. The only thing you need to be concerned about is having genetic testing with your partner to ensure they too are not carriers as two parents with the trait can produce a child with thr major form (and that is the only way to inherit the major form).\n\nOnly your doctor can diagnose you so leave it to them.  If you do have Thalassemia then you dont take iron (unless you are iron deficient), take folic acid, the b vitamins, vitamin c, eat healthy, get pleanty of exercise.  \n\nHonestly, most people with thalassemia minor are asymptomatic. This is exactly right.  Do not stress, OP. Thank you so much for your response. It did help out a lot not going to lie so thank you! I guess I just have to wait until I know for sure. Something you could do right now is take folic acid, b vitamins, vitamin d, or any other multivitamin that does not have iron. This may alleviate your symptoms a little if you have Thalassemia. If your blood volume is low try to increase your salt and water intake. I get dizzy a lot in the summer and this seems to help me.\n\nLike everyone else is saying, do not stress about it. I did not even know I had this until a year ago. And I am 28 years old. Try to have a positive attitude.", "Determining and surveying the role of carnitine and folic acid to decrease fatigue in \u03b2-thalassemia minor subjects. &gt; Beta-thalassemia minor (BTM) patients usually experience fatigue, bone pain complaint, and muscle weakness. Carnitine is an essential protein for transportation of long-chain fatty acids to the matrix for beta-oxidation. **BTM patients have abnormally low plasma carnitine concentrations, which results in deficient ATP production.**  Carnitine and folic acid together may have a role in preventing bone pain complaint and fatigue in these patients. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of carnitine and folic acid supplementation in subjects with BTM. Seventy three BTM (mean age 11.06 \u00b1 5.46 years) and 23 healthy controls (mean age 8.48 \u00b1 3.78 years) were enrolled in the study. Fasting blood was drawn to determine baseline free and total carnitine levels, red blood cell folate concentration, and hemoglobin level. BTM were divided into three groups and received different types of supplementation for 3 months: Group 1, 50 mg/kg/day carnitine; Group 2, 50 mg/kg/day carnitine plus 1 mg/day folic acid; and Group 3, 1 mg/day folic acid. Controls did not receive supplementation. Laboratory parameters were again evaluated after 3 months' supplementation. A detailed quality of life questionnaire was designed to investigate muscle symptoms before and after supplementation. Free and total plasma carnitine concentration and hemoglobin levels in BTM subjects increased significantly after carnitine supplementation (P &lt; .0001).

The only issue I had during pregnancy is I became more anemic and had to see a hematologist. That is actually true. \nYou had better checked your husband to see if he has thalassemia minor / intermedia too. \n\nIf not, your child indeed has a 50% chance to bear thalassemia minor trait. \nIf yes, your child has 50% chance to be minor, 25 to be major, 25% to be sane. \n\nAnyway, do not refrain from falling for someone only based on its genetic traits. If your partner has thal minor, you can do in-vitro fertilisation to make sure the embryo will not have the traits. \n\nAs for your question on pregnancy, you should be on Folate supplementation. In very few cases, blood transfusion can be a solution. Once i was in hospital in blood bank and i met a child who suffered from thalesemia major , both his parents were asymptomatic carriers of thalesemia minor . Get your so tested before getting married for thalesemia minor . Thalesemia major is too difficult and burdensome for parents . My pregnancy was hard but it had nothing to do with my thalassemia.

My partner was tested and he does not have it. There is a 50% chance that my daughter will have the minor type like me. \n\nYou just need to get your potential partner tested. My partner is British and we actually tested him after I was pregnant bc the hemopathologist suggested we do so My mother is a carrier and had two children. She passed beta minor to me and my sister got lucky and did not get the trait. So there is 50/50 in action!\n\nHer first pregnancy was fine but the second one was a bit tougher and she lost some hair. It grew back afterward and she is been fine since. She was in her mid/late 20s during both.\n\nI am personally not too worried about pregnancy when the time comes. I just keep hearing to load up on folate! I am 100% of Northern European extraction (according to AncestryDNA, anyway) and my husband is Egyptian on his dad's side and German on his mom's. I have BTM; he does not.\n\nI guess my point is, your doctor should not really have made such a sweeping generalization. Based on that line of thinking, my husband should be the one with BTM, not me. That is very good to know thank you I will get some of that supplement ! Omg that what I was already to tell her people think that all Mediterranean or middle eastern people have thalassemia I need people to know there is a prevalence for example in country with prevalence of 3 % of carriers for example if the population are 100 it will be just 3 carriers . It is rare even in Mediterranean or middle eastern and it is just some random mutation all over the world now .\nI am a carrier too and I cannot even found someone like me beside the family . Sometimes  I feel stigmatized but that something I do not choose to have it . Look if you have beta thal minor and your wife has it to then there is a 25% that your child will be diagnosed with beta thal major (very severe but I have it), 50% chance that your child will have beta thal minor like you or what we call trait, 25% chance your child will be perfectly normal. \n\n\n\nYour doctor recommended you that because middle eastern population have a large number of beta thal minor constituents. In case you could not understand the English quite well let me know and I will understand the process by a flow chart on paper. I am the wife in this situation lol, I am middle eastern so hence why I have it, my current partner is a pommy (uk) but he does not really know the deeper heritage of his background so not sure if I should make him get a DNA test when we plan it or just hope for the best Am very sorry about assuming that. \n\nEDIT: If possible I will suggest you to go ahead and take a Thalassemia Profile Test if possible add it will directly give the results of whether you do have Thalassemia or not and if you do then what type, another thing is it would be helpful if both of you get tested as you know prevention is better than cure so better not to take any chances with a life.", "Thalassemia ", "Good children\u2019s Hospitals for Thal My daughter is 5 with Beta thalassemia Major, adopted from China 2 years ago in 2019.

We have heard of the ones in Oakland and Los Angeles but are looking for more around the Midwest/east coast. Do you guys have any recommendations? CHOP and Lurie are great.

I know a few Thal Majors who were able to recieve \"cord blood: transplants from siblings and went on to live happy healthy symptom free lives. Just a thought..... Can you elaborate further on how this works? If the first child does not inherit thal from their parents, then their cord blood can somehow be used on a future child that inherits thal? As always consult a doctor. I am just someone who has thal major and my brother is thal minor. My understanding is if both you and your partner are thal minor carriers then your children have 1/4 chance of being major so the siblings cord blood can be useful if a cord blood transplant is needed. But if both of you are not carriers then I think your children will only have Thal minor so cord blood not needed......again, I am not a doctor.

The fatigue that I have from this is so extreme, I have no energy to do anything. My doctor recently prescribed my Adderall xr to help with my fatigue but I am still extremely tired. All other possible health problems have already been ruled out. \n\nDoes anyone have advice on what I can do? Thanks : -) You may want to have your doctor check your iron levels and your hemoglobin (red blood cell count) as well. If you are feeling this tired it may be because either or both of those are low. Your doctor may recommend iron supplements or a blood transfusion. Hope this helps! How you always been extremely fatigued or is it a recent thing? Because you would have had thalessemia your whole life. I also had extreme fatigue but it came about randomly one day, not something I have always been. In my case diet countered the fatigue. Ive always been extremely fatigued, but it has gotten so much worse recently. I havent really been eating healthy do that may be a factor. \nDo you follow a specific diet? Might not be relevant to you then but my problems came about suddenly and I believe I have \"leaky gut\" which a lot of people say is a pseudo illness but for me and a lot of other people it is the only thing that makes sense. Yeah I do a leaky gut/AIP diet. That has also happened to me as I have been getting older. What seemed to hinder is anxiety and weight gain in my case. This was mainly due to working tons of hours in a stressful job, and then having kids on top of all that. I have since lost some weight and started exercising. The exercising is tough because I get extreeemely fatigued, but working through it I am slowly feeling better over time. \n\nProbably not what you want to hear, but in my case it is about lifestyle changes that I have been fighting in my 20's and now as I am getting into my 40's it makes all the difference. Sport. Sport increases total RBC count. Aloha, I just started taking 1000mcg of folic acid for a week now, as prescribed from doctor and I feel . How long have you been taking b12 and folic acid, and have you noticed any difference in energy level? I have been taking it for a little over a month now, still feel exhausted : / Are you drinking enough water throughout the day? Do you exercise?

I am fortunate enough to have thalassemia minor therefore I do not need blood transfusion or bone marrow transplant. But it seems like the older I get the stronger thalassemia symptoms become. I am currently 23 years old and a college student. I still have 2 years left to finish my bachelors degree (I took a few years off after graduating high school). I find it the older I am getting the worse I am doing on tests. My brain stops working halfway through the exams and I become mentally tired. Is anyone else a student here? Have you experienced the same thing? I really appreciate any help and comfort anyone can give me... Thank you so much! I would probably want to first investigate other possible causes such as diet, exercise, sleep, etc, as they can make a big difference to your mental state, and have the benefit of being under your control. I agree with POGO. Make sure to rule out any other causes of your mental fatigue before coming to that conclusion. It seems more likely that the stresses of college may be at play.  Have you checked your hemoglobin lately?  Low Hb can cause brain fog, which sounds similar to what you are describing.  \n\nDo you take any folic acid or other supplements?  I have found they help somewhat. I got a PhD in math at the age of 28 so do not worry too much. Now the severity of  thal symptoms is different in different people but make sure you get enough folate (I take 800mcg Quatrefolic), sleep well and work out too.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am now in my late 30s and now life feels really tough.

Unfortunately I got sick after that and am still recovering.\n\nI also switched to sublingual 1000 mcg yesterday to maybe have a better effect.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this or tried B-12?

Hi there, I am also beta minor...I have tried b12 methylcobalamin pills for 2 months in a row but honestly did not find to have any improvements. I tried methylcobalamin oral tablets 1000 mcg and did not feel anything.\n\nI only get effects when using the sublingual tablets.\n\nWhich one did you use? I have had cognitive improvements after taking sublingual b12 for a few weeks\nWhat is the other B12 that you are taking all about, methyl... I have used sublingual tablets 1000ug also and folic acid. But honestly nothing special. Maybe it is just me. You have 2 types of b12 supplements, b12 from methylcobalamin and b12 from cyanocobalamin (cyano is from cianid yes a poison but very small dosage so it is not harmful). In theory methylcobalamin is much better than cyanocobalamin. I also am BTm and I found taking a liquid form of a b- complex to be life changing in a good way.  I found it in a capsule so it is easy to travel with.  I take roughly  double the recommended dose, and some days I also take a green tea pill with it. Usually I take it in the morning, and sometimes I take some more in the afternoon.  It has been a saving grace.  Without it I have zero energy. It gives me a little kick to get going and then I am good.  Some days I have to take a 20 min mid afternoon nap too.  Those really help as well.

I just want to know how ppl go through this knowing the offspring may potentially be very sick if she is also a carrier of the gene. what kind of genetic testing is required to find out if we are safe to have kids? TIA My dad and I have minor thalassemia, and the verdict is still out on my daughter. My dad did not learn about it until he already had kids, and I have known my whole life. It never really was a concern when my husband and I were thinking about kids. From what I understand, it is mostly in people of mediterranean heritage, and since my husband was swedish and german we never worried.\n\nThere is genetic testing you can do before hand, it is probably not that expensive if you are only testing one of you. \n\nIt is worth noting I had a lot of extra fatigue in pregnancy and very low iron levels. There was some concern of a blood transfusion during birth but I did not need it. So when she does get pregnant, take extra care of her. Yeah thanks. I do know my gf suffers from low iron so she cannot drink a lot of tea although she drinks a lot of tea. And myself, I am rich in iron so I have to drink tea all the time. Go figure. As far as she knows, her family does not have anyone with thalassemia. So, that is a plus, but I just do not want to risk it if our future child is going to be hospitalised from an early age. I think it would be morally irresponsible for me to do this knowing I have thalassemia to begin with. Well then I guess the best option would be to look into genetic testing to ease your mind. Have you talked to her about it? Yes, I have told her and she had said OK to genetic testing. I have beta thalassemia minor and we are TTC (trying to conceive) right now. We did genetic testing on my partner before we started to make sure we did not pass along intermedia or major. If you have minor but your partner does not have beta thalassemia, you can only pass on the minor form. Funny thing is i was diagnosed with beta thalassemia minor just one month before my marriage i did talk to my soulmate and she said she was ok with it we have a son now and trust me she is the one more concerned about my meds and food and it makes me feel blessed to have a wife who is taking my care \n\nWhen my son was born he showed no signs of beta thalassemia now all depends on his growing stage if he adapts my genes or her According to Ancestry.com, my ethnicity is 97% British Isles and 3% Germanic Europe, yet I carry the trait for beta thalassemia.

I live in NYC and my mom told me that I am more likely to contract coronavirus bc of having thalassemia trait, I am not sure how correct that is and thought I would ask this sub. Having the trait does not make you more susceptible. Living in NYC does more so.\n\nHowever, if you would look at the side effects of having thala, you know that our HCT/HGB levels are much lower compared to the population without thala. With that in mind, with our blood already carrying less oxygen combined with the health threat of suffering viral pneumonia where your oxygen levels will tank even more. It does not take a medical degree to add two n two together to come to the conclusion that it will hit us more than a average person with fully oxygenated blood. If a normal blooded person is already getting the wind knocked out of them, what will it do to us? It is best to take precautions than not. No more so than anyone else.\n\nJust keep taking precautions. Wash your hands whenever you have in public. Sanitizers high use surfaces in your home.

I woke up exhausted. \nOther funness today:\n- bone pain\n- cranky\n\nDoes anyone else get this?", "Anyone here a runner? I have been running my whole life with varied success. I feel my thalassemia is much more under control with life style changes I have taken over the years but I still have bad moments. Is anyone else on here a runner? I am training for my second marathon and I am not bragging--just curious about the rest of you.\n\nSome days it feels like I am choking on air--especially if it is humid out or if I have got a cold. I have always wondered how much of an impact thalassemia has on my running. Yes, I just ran my second full marathon last year and training to run my second half. It is possible, but you have to be very on point in everything you do lifestyle wise. From cleaning up what you eat to having proper rest days to rolling/stretching before bed. I follow these protocols religiously to avoid injury. I also do a lot of HR training to build my base. We have got a lot less margin of error to perform at our peak vs people with normal blood, so every little bit counts. So pay attention to running form and do not neglect strength/weight training as well! I do not run quite that much, but I do run a few times a week and do some 5ks. It definitely seems to take longer for me to build up in cardio compared to my peers, but I have found it seems to improve my blood counts especially if I make sure to get adequate rest. My best counts were shortly after running 14 miles. The number of red blood cells was over the \u201cnormal\u201d range which seemed to bring my hemoglobin close to the lower \u201cnormal\u201d limit (still not in the normal range but does not look like that will ever happen for me). I have discovered strength training is the key to keeping myself injury-free. Do you mind if I ask if you are male or female? Thank you for the answer. I do not get my blood tested regularly but I have thought about it since I doubled my weekly mileage over the last 1.5 years. Do you mind me asking if you are male or female? And is your rbc count usually high? I did cross-country in HS, but was never able to perform well. I found out why later from blood tests that I have alpha thala minor and my hgb/hct were in the tubes. Overtime, my knees gave out from arthritic pain and I had to give up on running completely. \n\ntl;dr to your question, I picked running back up 2 years ago as a consequence of my knee pain going away after switching to a whole food plant based diet. The inflammation in my knees went away and from there, I started to increase my distance in running and went to checkmark my bucket list. Finishing a marathon. I am now able to recover much faster from hard workouts and long runs than I ever did at my peak in HS, so I credit a lot of it to my diet change as well. \n\nAnd I am a 33yo male if that helps any. Be sure to keep an eye on your blood tests, particularly iron and vitamin B12 levels. My current hgb is 12.1 and hct 38, which is higher before I made the big lifestyle changes. Overall, strength training, take it easy via HR training to make sure you do not overtax your body, and make sure what you eat fuels your body. \n\nOh and another thing I noticed that hits me more than others, dehydration! I sweat anywhere between 1-1.5 pounds per 2 miles ran, so if you are going on long runs, be sure to bring lots of water! Are you thal major or minor? Definitely not major. No problem. I am female. RBC counts are usually within the normal to higher end of the normal range. It surprised me a little to see them above normal. Hemoglobin is usually around 9.5 to 11.5 max (or 95 to 115 if measured in dl I believe), though I hit 8.3 when I had surgery on a broken leg. Normal range usually starts at 12 or 12.5 if I remember correctly on my blood tests. \n\nI have noticed a trend that higher rbc correlates to higher hemoglobin in my blood tests.  I usually take them every 6 months to every year or two. So who knows what happens in between that time. While I was in the hospital for three days and got daily blood tests, my hemoglobin went from 9.7 to 9.3 to 8.3, so it can fluctuate somewhat rapidly. \n\nIf I feel more anemic than usual, I find taking some folate in the form of l-5-mthf helps. I will take a 500 mcg tablet daily until it gets better. if I take it for too long it seems to make me restless and cause racing thoughts. \n\nSorry if this is too much info. Went off on a tangent a bit there. No! This is a perfect response. One last question for you. Do you ever feel short of breath running or otherwise? Yes, all the time. Sometimes I get short of breathe just going up stairs, even if I am actively running and know I am in shape.  I will feel extremely weak with it as well. Severity comes and goes in waves and I have not found much of a pattern for why it is worse at times than others. I try to just exercise to my ability each day. If things seem off, I just do a lighter run. Sometimes it will be bad when I start my run, but my body will suddenly adjust after a warm up period. \n\nI keep bringing it up with doctors but they have been completely useless. I just get \u201cwell I do not know why you are feeling short of breathe and light headed, but it is not because of xyz item that was recently tested\u201d. I even had a hematologist tell me that my low blood count should not be causing that. My body should be \u201cused to it\u201d. I am no doctor, but I am pretty sure that is not how anemia works. \n\nI am not bitter at all... lol So funny finding this - \n\nI am 43-yo and all my life I have played competitive sports.  I always thought I ran out of breath before others, even though I worked just as hard.  I got into trail running a couple years ago and started pushing my own personal boundaries, and really diving into my health.  I got blood labs and have low MCV, MCH, and slightly elevated RDW. \n\nThey found that my iron levels were sufficient, but every time I donate blood I feel completely wrecked unless I take a pre and post iron supplement (that could be unrelated though). \n\nThat said, I still enjoy running 2-3 times a week (4-6 miles); and have a strict weight lifting regimen of 3x a week.  Living at high altitude, I find myself a little more susceptible to huffing and puffing (not sure if that is related).\n\nThat said, even though I am a bit slower, I find that keeping at the running, etc makes me feel great overall. I am curious what your diet is like. Typically after workouts/runs, a protein smoothie consisting of:\n\n2 bananas, 1 cup of frozen blueberries, 1 protein scoop/serving powder, 2tbspn flaxseed meal, 1-2tbspn peanut butter, 1.3cups of soy milk. \n\nThen I would have an apple after. These are my daily staples.\n\nEverything else I have some kind of cruciferous vegetable daily. Whether it be broccoli, cauliflower, bok choy, or brussel sprouts. Followed by tofu, some kind of carb heavy main dish. It can be a mix of rice + lentils or oatmeal. \n\nFor the moment I am having chili nearly on the daily to go with the rice + lentil combo. The chili consists of tomatoes, carrots, celery, and kidney beans. Not a running but pretty active.  I find I burn out really quickly when I am doing certain high intensity exercises (sprinting, swimming) but have an enormous amount of stamina for sustained lower intensity exercise (jogging, hiking).", "How are you?

Got to know when I was 19 year old. My maternal family suffers from it. Have been having strange sicknesses which come on its own and go away on its own many times without any reason. Depression has been kicking in and out since I was young as my father suffered from it too.\n\nTired\n\nLethargic\n\nSick with some pain or so\n\nDepressed but otherwise happy go-lucky\n\nRarely exercise\n\nYep, that is me. I really need to understand further as last year has been devastating for me. No, I did not contract Covid. Thankfully. I started sleeping for hours suddenly. I am sleeping the whole night and wake up at 6am. Finish some jobs by 9.30am. I get knocked out and then wake up directly 5 or 6. that too getting up felt like a pain and I felt like I wanted to sleep more. This started happening once in every three days. Guess it happened for a couple of months and then it stopped. Then couple of months, I was hardly doing any physical work then I got pregnant and we aborted due to personal reasons but instead of just a medicine, it was a vaginal abortion of two and a half months old pregnancy. No doubt about a lot of blood loss and blah blah.\n\nCouple of months after it, there was tingling in both of my hands and shoulder pain. I had not slept properly for over a month. Sleeping hardly 4-5 hours once a day. So I showed to an Orthopedic doctor who said looking at the X-ray that it is a mild spondylosis. It should not cause such a sharp pain cause this is normal for everyone to have mild spondylosis. He recommended a neurological specialist. The neurology specialist did the MRI, nerve test and a couple of other. You have fibromyalgia and something else also. I had no sensation in my ring finger and pinky finger in both of my hands. More in left than in right. I cannot remember the name of the problem what he said. Ideally there is only mild problem and your hands and nerves are responding normally. He said you take nerve relaxation medicine for a month and you should be fine. It took me a month to reach this diagnosis and then with exercises and medicines, I was like bedridden tired.\n\nI was resting in the name of being sick. Could not get up and then I got a vertigo attack. Severe nausea, could not eat, vomiting, could not walk, of lie down without feeling dizzy. Never had it before. Went to general practitioner and then Neurological specialist, he gave me a couple of medicines. 20 days and vertigo was gone. Apparently, I was not using pillow on some days coz of spondylitis, guess that caused it.\n\nBack to spondylitis pain then. It continued another month. By this time, I had the nerve medicine which helps me sleep in the nights for atleast 4 months. Suddenly, I started gaining weight. More than half a kilo a day. Then I visited neurology specialist saying the pain has increased and can you give me meds. He asked, \"Do you have depression or do you feel stressed at home?\" Do not know I broke down completely. Coz I was sick for 4 months and 4 months of pregnancy thing (including the time pre and post abortion) + covid + stay at home husband and child and schooling. It took a toll on me. Felt like what if I will not get better ever. It was mind boggling. He said, I will recommend you to psychiatrist but I refused as I knew my husband will not agree to it. Then he said I can give you some meds but no point coming to me. So I left and decided to lift my spirits myself with diet and painting.\n\nGuess what, pain was gone but I could not loose weight at all in spite of desperate efforts. Diet, exercise, nothing worked. 2 months of happy no sickness period, suddenly I started having an upset stomach like pooping 5 times a day. The moment I eat, I felt like pooping. Urinating every 10 minutes. Going out for a walk was impossible. Although it was not serious, I knew this was not to be ignored. I went to doc for check up; somehow came back and did not go again. Ignored it and felt better again after a month. Out of the blue, I started feeling breathless one day for almost 45 minutes without any harsh activity. I did not mention feeling it is one off but within 3 days, it happened again. This time, I ran to the GP again. I asked him to do a blood test CBC, check for BP, Thyroid and Diabetes. So except for CBC, everything is normal.\n\nNow comes the actual part where I started seeking for answers coz my report looked like an exam that I failed terribly as if I have never started studying. I was shocked at the amount of asterisks on it. They were more than other times.\n\nHaemoglobin - 9.4\n\nHaematocrit- 0.34\n\nMCV - 58\n\nMCH - 16\n\nMCHC - 28\n\nPlatelets - 484\n\nBasically all of the above are lower than the normal but all of the below are higher\n\nRDW - 20.1\n\nRed cell count - 5.8\n\nI guess for years, I have got this kind of report but none of the doctors paid attention to it until it got this worse. Anyways, GP did further test to check the severity of Anaemia.\n\nIron Saturation - 12\n\nVit B12 - 105\n\nFolic Acid - 9.0\n\nVit D3 - 38.2\n\nAgain, all of the above is low and all of the below is higher than the normal range.\n\nRed cell count - 6.3\n\nHbA2 - 4.8\n\nAfter this report, I took multivitamins for 20 days twice a day (double the normal dose) but still went fucking breathless again. My husband researched and said may be you have pernicious anaemia cause your symptoms match. So, I went to a Hematologist. I asked him, \"Do I have Pernicious Anaemia?\" He said, \"Yes seems like it. Let us test it. Just for you to know it happens cause of three major reasons.\n\n\\- Deficiency of folate\n\n\\- immense blood loss during mensuration (I have an existing fibroid and had abortion)\n\n\\- Glutton allergy\"\n\nGreat, so he gave me a 1000mcg Vit B12 injection and iron and folic acid medicines. The result of the test are to come in 2 weeks. A week already passed and I got to know that my\n\nFerritin is as low as 13 which is supposed to be 13-150.\n\nNow while awaiting the results and eating the prescribed meds, it is of course causing stress to me and many around me. For 2 days, again I felt vertigo then I did exercise, now I have started feeling spondylitis pain every day and I am sure it is cause of stress. I started researching more and read on megaloblastic Anemia but it seems different. I am so confused. Pernicious Anemia they say that it develops slowly and sometimes, people keep falling sick for 20-30 years and they do not know that they have it. All the illnesses are due to it. To be frank, I am tired of being sick. It has been like forever. I am just going on cause I have a family. They need me. I am not depressed right now. I am fucking determined to find the fucking cause of this. My child once said to someone, \"My mother is always sick.\" I hate that.\n\nDoes any one know what is the problem here? First of all, I am so sorry to hear you are unwell\n\nI have had a lot of problems that I am not quite sure are related to my Thalassemia or not. It is so frustrating. I also had to terminate a pregnancy last year for personal reasons. It does not seem fair we are unwell to being with then have to go through that.\n\nI have also had horrible fatigue, depression and vertigo. I would say the vertigo is the worse and I can sympathize with you there. I went to see an herbal lady after my pregnancy loss and she is given me some stuff that really helps. The only problem is when I try not to take it. I went five days without all of my supplements and got so sick and had vertigo that whole night! I think my deficiency is with my adrenal glands though. I take adrenal extract and if I skip some days I feel like shit. I have mentioned Addison\u2019s disease to my primary but she was not convinced with my symptoms but I might try to ask again.\n\nI too have a gluten intolerance but it is not that bad it just makes me bloat and break out really bad.\n\nAgain, I am sorry you are unwell. Feel free to message me if you want someone to talk to about it. I can totally relate to you. I am so sorry that you are going through this. I had also resorted to dieticians to bring me back to normalcy but I kept jumping from one disease to other. I have been reading and watching a lot on pernicious Anemia and now it all makes sense. I saw this documentary by Living with the Fog by Pernicious Anaemia Society. It is in 3 or 4 parts on youtube. Somehow, after watching it, it all makes sense to me. I am still awaiting the results though. I have been sick for like forever but until a few years back, I could still work but currently I am completely relying on other people to take care of me. I am definitely a strong person and I am hardcore sure that I do not have depression. I want to find the root cause. With Thalassemia, we somehow have accepted we have less energy but not all Thalassemic people are sick all the time so this is not just it. I have seen energetic mothers who are Thalassemic. Yeah it sounds like your anemia is a little bit worse than mine as far as labs go. I am somehow within the normal range apart from MCV which is just barely low. But that does not mean I struggle with other things. I know how it is when you just feel helpless. That is the most annoying part I think. Is there anything you do that you think helps or makes it worse? Im not a doctor but, when you are telling your story you seems like you are telling mine . So you and me are in the same level (I am also a carrier BTminor). I had everything you had it and i did everything you did except the vitamins bloocheks. \nNow I am feel stable but not well as I was maybe 3 years ago I am 27 yrs .\n\nNow I think before all you should correct all the vitamins deficiency that you got because : \n\nDeficiency in vitamins D : give depression , low energy,low immunity.,etc\n\nIn vitamin B 12 AND 9 (folic acid) : give anemia and B12 deficiency is the cause of pernicious anemia because B12 cannot be absorbed or low (doctor can know it of a high MCV  but lately was a case of betathalassemia minor and B12 deficiency which misleads doctors diagnosis because in betathalassemia we can not have high MCV even if we got B12 deficiency. And with B12 deficiency you can have a lot of symptoms from benign to severe especially the neurological ones .\n\nIn iron deficiency: you got anemia again and anemia can do a lot of problems \n\nI want to know how you assume that you are lactose intolerant because I got bloated when I drink milk \n\nAnd I want you after you will go see hematologist to tell me the result what he found . Hi thankyou for your response. I was kind of unwell and well in last few days and totally forgot about this post. \n\nFirstly I am feeling way better. Can breathe normally. Hot flashes decreased a bit. I was getting good sleep until my tablets exhausted and my appointment was delayed at the haemetologist. Same time I had my periods, Sono tablets + blood loss = Insomniac. Pernicious Anaemia result came as  negative. A big relief. But doctor said D3 is not low and I should go out in sunlight. I wanted to tell him that I do not have energy but then he said you can take generic Vitamin D pills from over the counter. \n\nGot my new reports done. And the results are absolutely awesome. Now that does not mean that I stop medication. I am taking vitamin B12 (500mg), iron (100mg), folic acid (5mg) daily and will start vitamin D. \n\nMy results are here\n\nHaemoglobin 10.2    increased from 9.4\n\nIron 13              it is the same\n\nVitamin B12  224       Increased from 105\n\nFolic Acid 79.6.           Increased from 9.0\n\nPlatelets.  328.           Decreased from 484    \n normal range of platelets is 140-440\n\nRDW 15.5.         ...      Decreased from 20.1\nNormal range is 11 - 15.5\n\nRed cell count 6.1.      Decreased from 6.3\nNormal range is 3.9 to 5.6\n\nSo except iron, everything is on track. I have been unwell in between little but mostly back on track in terms of breathing and energy. Guess it is the recovery process. But doctor said the main cause of the decrease in iron is my heavy menstrual blood loss. So he said you need to take tablets to lessen the blood loss during the heavy period days which I refused coz frankly I felt that it definitely will have side effects and will surely mess with my hormones. But now I am confused as to how to increase the iron deficiency. \n\nAny thoughts? Yes as your doctor told you the main thing is to treat the cause .", "Is it possible to get thalassemia if none of my parents have it? Hi, I am 25. My haemoglobin levels have always been low since my childhood, and is currently at 8.\nAlso additional information, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 2 years ago(my mother has it). I have been asked to get myself tested for thalassemia minor, is it possible for me to have it even if my parents do not?", "I have Beta Thalassemia minor, I am pregnant, and am a carrier for Alpa Thallasemia. Is it possible to have one and be a carrier for only the other? I was diagnosed with Beta Thalassemia Minor at birth and just had the usual anemia, low blood count, and fatigue. I take folic acid to help with my blood count, and that is all I generally need to do. \n\nI got pregnant and have been a little more anemic and had some genetic testing done. \n\nI expected to be a carrier for beta thalassemia, Not Alpha thalassemia. I cannot find any information on being positive for beta thalassemia and only being a carrier of alpha thalassemia. \n\nRight now my worry is I could have both since it is been found that it is possible to have both, and I am only a carrier due to it being either the dominant mutation or something else.\n\nMy question is, is it possible to be positive for 1 and be a carrier for the other yet not have it? Or is it possible I was diagnosed with the wrong mutation, or have both? I was diagnosed 20\u00bd years ago if that makes a difference. I guess it is possible to have both if each of your parents had one of the traits, but if that was the case you would most likely be dead by now or at the very least had a terrible life with such a disease.  With minor or no symptoms it is most likely Beta thalassemia minor. If you really need to have confirmation you can do a genetic health test like 23andme for example. I know that I have beta thalassemia minor I put in the post I was diagnosed at birth with it. And there are living people who have both traits, just depends on severity whether I would be dead or not. \n\nI just was not sure if you could test for one and if it came up positive not bother checking for the other. I have also never heard of anyone having one mutation and being a carrier only for the other. Also I do not think I would trust 23andme to do an accurate health test. I only discovered I was a carrier of alpha thalassemia due to being carrier tested since I have beta thalassemia minor and am pregnant. Fellow pregnant beta thalassemia minor here. You should definitely ask your OB this, they should know. \n\nHere is my experience. Because of my condition, my doctor also had my husband blood tested for thalassemia. Thankfully, he is negative so baby only has a 50% chance of beta thalassemia minor. If he was a carrier or also minor, baby\u2019s odds of minor and major would increase. Not sure about it being a dominant trait or if there were any mutations. \n\nGood luck! I was told the same and my husband is negative too! And the thalassemia disorder itself is actually considered a mutation that is what I meant by mutation! \n\nI am honestly just trying to get answers to the carrier part of it since I cannot find info on having one and being a carrier of the other. But I have found lots of studies where someone can carry both genetic mutations. Did you get carrier tested for both and came out positive for both? Were you diagnosed Just from bloodwork ou did you do a genetic test? Also a 23andme test would be accurate as these are straightforward mutations that are easy to test. Honestly I recommend seeing a hematologist. That Is what I have ended up having to do. I had one OB tell me i am only a carrier, and another tell my i am symptomatic. They are currently treating me fore anemia, although the high amounts of iron they have prescribed me has done nothing to increase my hemoglobin levels. I was diagnosed at birth with beta thalassemia minor. \n\nI did not get carrier tested till I was pregnant and was tested to see if I was a carrier for any of 179 different things and including being a carrier of my disorder, and alpha thalassemia. \n\nBut I am only a carrier for alpha thalassemia, yet I was diagnosed when I was Born with beta thalassemia minor. \n\nAnd sorry I just do not trust 23andme. They do not use blood which is more accurate than spit. I had the genetic carrier screening done using a blood sample. I can try to find one nearby, and you seem to have a minor version which can either show no symptoms or the most mild which includes anemia. \n\nAlso iron will not help you should actually watch your iron levels so you do not get overloaded. It is better to just get it through veggies and some fruits honestly. \n\nAs for the hemoglobin levels my levels went to normal after I started taking folic acid and it helped a ton. If you research many studies and medical sites say no iron supplements or to be cautious with them and to take folic acid to help with the blood count. &gt;I am honestly just trying to get answers to the carrier part of it since I cannot find info on having one and being a carrier of the other. \n\nI think you are confused here. Being a carrier means you inherited only one gene from one of your parents. Having a trait, being a carrier or having  the minor version are all synonyms here.  \n\nIf you inherited only one Beta thalassemia gene then you have Beta thalassemia minor and are considered a carrier for Beta thalassemia.\n\nSame for Alpha thalassemia:  \nIf you inherited  only one Alpha thalassemia gene then you have Alpha thalassemia minor and are considered a carrier for Alpha thalassemia.\n\nIf you inherited two genes then you are not just \"carrier\", you have complete genetic disorder with serious health problems hence the \"major\".  \n\n\nSee: ( Yeah, that is the main reason i am meeting with a hematologist. I am also pregnant so the last thing i want right now is to go into iron overload. \n\nAlso, i think it (thalassemia) had a part to play in me recently being diagnosed with GD even though i have been eating relatively well, and going on almost daily walks. \u2014i do not have a family history of GD, and i was not overweight or gained too much weight during pregnancy. Ok I understand that, but it still does not make sense for one test to be positive for beta thalassemia minor, what I was told by my pediatrician. Yet when I was carrier tested it came up for alpha thalassemia not beta which I have been repeatedly told I have. After my pediatrician diagnosed it I have always been told by her it was the minor version.\n\nBut when new doctors clarify it, they have the answer in a couple days and just tell me beta thalassemia, not that its minor or not. They do not seem to be testing for the gene because that takes a couple weeks, but I do know they look at my blood. And I also know I have mild symptoms of beta thalassemia but never needed a blood transfusion, just folic acid supplements to help my very low blood count. And after the supplements my blood levels were normal. \n\nSo being a carrier for alpha thalassemia, could I possible have alpha thalassemia instead? And be misdiagnosed with beta if the people testing may not see it very often? I am just very confused at this point since I have been told it was minor my whole life and have mild symptoms and anemia, yet I am not a carrier for what I was diagnosed with. You were most likely misdiagnosed with beta. Just make an appointment with an hematologist to clear things up. It is possible since it makes it more likely. Though I failed my 1 hr, and passed my 3hr  think because I drank water and used the restroom during versus not when I had my 1hr. I also have a family history of diabetes, a little over weight, eat very well, and walk when this kid let us me breathe and it is not raining here! But then again every pregnancy is different. You could do everything right and still have GD. Who knows hopefully it is a one time thing! Thank.you I will ask them because it would mean a few different possible complications with my pregnancy, though I would still rather have beta minor anyday. Thank you for your help. I did not know i was allowed to drink water during the test! That could have helped me. They only had me do a 1 hour test, not a 3 hour.... i guess because i failed it so bad... I got a 143 on my 1hr and if you failed the 1hr which is extremely common, they should also do a 3hr. Mind if I ask what you got as your results? Yeah.... i got a 210 on the 1 hr. Ouch did you eat before hand? Or did you fast? I fasted over night before hand But my blood levels on every test have been all over the place, either too high or too low. Which is another reason I would like to meet with a hematologist Yeah.... ouch that would explain no 3hr test, but yeah drinking water could have helped you especially if its possible you have thalassemia. Yeah it would definitely be a good idea since pregnancy puts a strain on your organs in the first place just being a normal human. It is also possible to be completely unrelated to a blood disorder and could be how your body processes sugar! Hopefully the hematologist can help figure that out! So, I have both the traits, Alpha and Beta. And I am a Thalassemia Intermedia patient. Childhood was rough but I am alright now. Is it possible that you were also a Thal Intermedia patient? \n\nThal intermedia is not as bad as Major but it has its complications. So maybe you could have been misdiagnosed. It is possible that is what I think happened, though I am going to make some phone calls and try to get to a hematologist and to better prenatal care just in case. Especially since I am pregnant and if I was misdiagnosed it will be hell trying to deal with the hospital I go to and trying to get proper care. \n\nIt just makes it annoying since the nurses and midwives at my hospital do not want anyone to been seen in person unless truly necessary, and every possible appointment that was considered necessary before the pandemic should still be necessary now! Especially if this blood disorder is different that what it was thought to be.(worse or both or the other) That sucks dude I hope you find answers, and stay safe. It is not the end of the world, but I hope I find answers too! And you stay safe too! Direct to Consumer Genetic tests, including 23 and Me, are not reliable yet. They have about a 40% error rate on \"straightforward mutations\". ( All mutations are equally easy to test for, some mutations convey more concrete information than others. You will need a confirmatory test for anything you get even off the \"health\" tests. You are right not to trust 23 and Me 40% error rate on DTC genetic tests, posted article above as well: ( Thank you I think they are fun but that is about it! I am also currently having my blood disorder retested to see if I was misdiagnosed, have both, or see what is going on lol. \n\nI did ancestry for fun and it is definitely very interesting honestly but I know it is not 100%! Yeah I did as well - it is fun. It is got 99.9% accuracy for things like finding blood relatives! But agree about the blood test - I uploaded raw data and loaded it onto a health site and it is analysis indicated three or four conditions that would not have allowed me to live past 5 or 6 years old, as well as one that would have made me unable to speak or move. \n\n(32 and no health conditions, met all the developmental milestones) So if you need accuracy do a blood test that is intended for diagnostic purposes. Is beta-thalassemia minor the one Pete Sampras has? The relatives part is my favorite because it is fun to see! And as for the health site it is possible you could just be a carrier vs. Actually having a possibility of having it. Though you will not know till you get it tested by a doctor\ud83d\ude0a I am having a blood test done by my doctors! I get to hear the results next week! I am very excited! Yes for sure, I should have mentioned that it indicated double copies 100% chance of the most severe form of disease Did you do two DTC tests by any chance? And I am not sure I have no clue who that is? Though right now as far as my medical records its hunting at just Alpha thalassemia and the beta got mixed in due to it being word of mouth after my pediatrician switched offices and half my records did not transfer with her. Of course! That is why I had the carrier testing done along with my husband to make sure there was not a possibility for the deadly versions! Awesome. That will be pretty odd if you have both and they never had any indication before. DTC? I am not sure if I did or not but my first test was a mandatory one after I was born, the the next test I had done the midwife never told me other wise despite me being a carrier for only Alpha not beta! Yes! Yeah the test said I was basically dead bc of the double copies of the autosomal co-dominant and the single copies of the autosomal dominant. Or dead 25 years ago. But then I saw someone else's test and they had almost double the number of mutations. (90 something vs 40 something). Did you find that you guys were carriers of things you were unaware of? Agreed and I did have indications due to a mandatory test I mentioned and my low CBC, mild anemia, and constant fatigue. Ooh OK. Do you happen to know if they test for thalassemia before surgical procedures? Only accurate thing about my direct to consumer test was carrier for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency F allele vs normal M allele. Actually yes we did my Alpha thalassemia was only known to me since it was never mandatory for my other family and I was the second of the new generation! And I am also a carrier for nephrotic syndrome type 2 which is a deadly kidney defect. \n\nMy husband is a carrier for usher's syndrome which is just variable levels for blindness and deafness. So crazy what we are carrying around without realizing and and while healthy No they do not unless you ask. You could say that is came up on a test result you had and want more info on it or for some one to explain it better to you! \n\nYou can also type in the result and see what scientific studies pop up just take it with a grain of salt but it will help give some insight for the time being! Agreed it is insane my husband's family had no idea and neither did mine till I was born with the alpha thalassemia. My brother we have no clue if he is a carrier or not since he never got a letter about his results like I did. My mom assumed he was the lucky 1 in 4 who inherited none of it while I the lucky duck seemed to have sucked it all up! Is there any chance on the carrier test you got they could have gotten the result and then recorded information manually (so for example human error could have been involved in mixing up the two thalassemias) 20 years ago possibly but they compared the test number and etc. to my name and the fact that I may have been the only preemie getting the test done for that hospital at the time, it seems unlikely. But it seems my infant results are alpha, I am a carrier of alpha, now I just get to wait for the results to confirm it and hopefully they will tell me what level it is! I do not think I am strictly a carrier and my family seems to think it is possible I have Hbh since well no one in my family got tested and I seem to have the related symptoms and health issues that go with the fairly moderate version. \n\nAt one point I went to donate blood and my little finger monitor thing said I  was at 95 when it should have been 125, so it is pretty low with out help.", "Should I take iron supplements? My iron count is 110. I believe normal is above 120. My rbc is high.\n\nShould I take iron supplements like feramax? I would talk to your doctor about your iron if you think you should take iron supplements. I have too much iron from multiple blood transfusions but my hemoglobin is always low so people think I should take iron for my anemia because they think I have iron deficient anemia which is wrong in my case. On the contrary I take pills to reduce the amount of iron I have in my system, so before taking anything consult your doctor because they will know best. I have thal minor and my hgb is 99. Ferritin is also low but my doc advised me to eat more iron rich foods and to cook with a cast iron pan And not to eat iron pills?what is your rbc count like? What Symtoms do you have ?? If any RBCs are normal I look a little pale and sometimes I can feel my heart fluttering if I get really tired Hi i would like to notice if you got thal minor and low ferritenin that is a combo of 2 things that will make you anemic its beta thalassemia minor and iron deficiency you need to consult your doctor for iron supplements I am now taking a supplement Yeah that should be monitored by your doctor with a precise time then do a blood check to see what happen if your ferritenin went back to normal so you will stop and try to eat properly to not be in that situation again .", "Thalassemia minor and illness during period Hi! First time posting.\n\nI would love to talk to other women who have Thalassemia minor and experience weird symptoms during their periods.  For years I have experienced random flu like symptoms at the end of my period that usually send me to bed with terrible chills and a fever, sometimes it is just general ickiness or malaise and body aches but it is brutal. I have never required treatment for Thalassemia before but I mentioned it to my doctor and she thinks the blood loss might be what is making me feel so sick since my levels are low. \n\nHas anyone else ever experienced this or had similar conversations with their doctors? I am seeing a hematologist next month and would love to be prepared to have this conversation before I am mansplained to about my periods. Thank you!", "Folic acid I am trying to supplement to improve symptoms.\nHas anyone taken folic acid? How much? Did it help? I tried it for a few years, but it did not make any difference for me personally. I do not know if others have had similar experiences. \n\nI am mostly asymptomatic (beta intermedia) if that is a reference point. \n\nI am curious what experiences others have had. They had me taking extra folic acid when I was pregnant. (On top of what was in my prenatal)\n\nStill taking it. Have not noticed much of a difference, my dizziness and fatigue are still pretty bad but I also have a 3 month old baby soooo... Have you tried vitamin e, mixed tocopherols? B6 may also help, like 10mg of p5p. But check out pubmed for thalassemia and vitamin e. I take one tablet a day, seems to help with my fatigue levels (alpha trait) I take 5mg (5,000mcg) of 5-methyl folate.  It is the bioavailable version of folic acid.  I take that along with B6, B12, Vitamin E, Vitamin D, and wheatgrass.  This combination has raised my Hb by about 1 point, so a pretty substantial improvement for me. Just make sure you are getting it along with other essential vitamins and minerals, apart from iron. Did you get more energy? I think so, I find it hard to quantify though. Alpha carrier here. 3 weeks ago I started taking 1g Folic Acid after speaking with my doctor. Usually I need to drink coffee around lunch time to get me through the afternoon, and even then, falling asleep instantly when I get home and lay down. Now I notice I am not as tired in the afternoon and even when I get home from work. So far I think it has helped. I take multivitamin and vitamin C as well. The gummies from Costco. Used to take one a day till I was about 21. Did not see any change when I stopped the iron chelation injection (and folic acid) alongside.

And now that I am working out. Deadlifts and backrows do make me dizzy. After a long workout even squatting down or bending over for a few seconds to pick up the weights is enough to make me dizzy.\n\nlifting also causes my heart rate to spike dramatically.

She has always been a very picky eater and is anemic with very low energy that could usually be fixed with a nap. However, since starting school her energy levels have plummeted which has resulted in colossal meltdowns which are totally unlike her. Early bed times and naps are doing nothing for her. Does anyone use supplements for their child to increase energy? Any foods you can get them to eat that naturally increase energy levels?", "Is there a relationship between thalassemia and premature ejaculation?  Is there a relationship between thalassemia and premature ejaculation? Will thalassemia cause premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction due to hypoxia? Noop there is no relation and there is no hypoxia if it was hypoxia you will be so sick No, erection is a reflex of the parasympathetic nervous system the nerves fire to dilate the vascular network in your penis and then the sympathetic nervous system fires to ejaculate. It does not have to do with oxygen delivery it has to do with sensation and electrical signals. \n\nI do think it can make you fatigued though like if your having sex and muscles get tired maybe cramp easily that is distracting and takes away from the sensation which can then make it hard to orgasm. I cannot think of what might cause premature ejaculation though. No, absolutely not. Do some exercise and TRT later in life.", "Please help me, how do I treat this? Hello everyone, I am a 20F Asian with thalassemia minor, genetically inherited. All my life I had issues with running - I loved it, but would have very weird symptoms like my whole face turning white after some brief intense running, choking feelings, breathlessness and feeling like passing out (although I never did)\n\nAfter a blood test 2 years ago, I realised I had inherited thalassemia, along with low-blood pressure. Hence, I am lacking in iron and constantly feel hungrier than other people. However, I really want to resolve these two issues - they are hindering my running progress! I want to join a sports club in college but this too, is stopping me from doing it D: Anyone here has any suggestions? Should I visit a doctor or find my own supplements? Thank you! Absolutely go to a doctor for advice, they should be able to advise you what kind of supplements to look for and do some tests to make sure there is not a more serious issue. \n\nAnecdotally, I know exactly where you are coming from with the running issue. I noticed a HUGE difference in my running endurance after I start focusing more on weight training, specifically in my legs. So, squats every day, increasing weight as it becomes easy, and so on. All my school and university life i was all ok never ever felt weakness or tired but when i reached my 27 this all started to appear i feel tired even after sleeping for 8 hours i feel my muscles are weak especially the biceps do you think weight training will help me out ? Iron and folic acid was what my dr prescribed me qhen i started developing the symptoms i couldnt even walk without feeling my heartbeat and was feeling extreme weak so you should talk to your doctor about taking the iron and folic acid that time my hb was pretty low too Ah, squats! Yes, I actually have pretty muscular thighs from running for a couple of years; however, my build-up of muscles has not exactly helped me in the my endurance :( Yes! I think I will see a doctor too and get some supplements; not only is this affecting my running, but I feel tired all the time despite having a regular sleep schedule D: We all know how that tiredness makes you feel becuase we all go through it. We hope you feel better please let us know how it goes You should consult your doctor and share your resrarch. The following is just my anecdotal experience. I am in a similar boat with running\n\nIf your diet is not lacking anything, then you need to gradually build your endurance. Do not over exert yourself. It takes me longer than most people to recover from DOMS.\n\nI take folic acid which is a popular supplement suggested by this subreddit. I would be careful about taking iron if you have thalassemia. My doctor put me on iron and my levels ended up too high. Focus on eating iron rich foods paired with foods rich in vitamin C to help increase the iron absorption. Make sure to also include folic acid in your diet as well. If you are vegan/vegetarian, B12 supplements also helps with RBC production. Fixing up my dietary habits helped me alleviate the symptoms.", "1 yr old Beta Thal minor - Iron Hello!\n\nI am new to this community so thanks for all the insight. My 1 yr old daughter and I have Beta Thal minor and I was wondering what the community thought about iron supplements. Her iron level is 9.7 and our pediatrician said she spoke to a hematologist who recommends an iron supplement. I have heard conflicting information though and would love if anyone can share some wisdom on the matter.\n\nThanks! Sorry to say all I have is conflicting information as well. My dad was told to increase his iron years ago, then they changed their minds. I was told to take iron as a teen and it made me sick. Then when I was pregnant I took tons of it and was fine.\n\nIt is kind of up in the air, so I guess try it or at least try eating more iron rich foods and see how you guys feel. I was told to take iron as a kid then when I heard that could be harmful so was told to stop taking it. I would not take iron without further blood work to make sure it is actually needed. Our hemoglobin makes it seem like we need it, when we do not and it can be harmful. I am linking a forum that I have used in the past.\n\n\n I do not have any specific recommendations for children - that is totally out of my realm. I have the same type of thal though and was told to not take iron because I just cannot absorb it. Prior to being diagnosed, I was put on high doses of iron because my doctors initially thought I had severe anemia (iron levels super low) but I did not respond to the iron supplements. My body simply cannot absorb it properly so it only causes problems and solved nothing. I did find that the supplement \u201cBlood Builder\u201d by MegaFood helped but I am also an adult. I was later advised to go easy on this supplement just to be safe. I do know some people with beta minor just need transfusions and that is really the only thing that helps. I personally take folate which is the most commonly recommended supplement. I happen to have ADHD, diagnosed as an adult as well, and find that the stimulants I am on like Ritalin help with the fatigue a lot but that is obviously a complicated and unique solution given my situation. \nAbove all, I can say this condition is difficult. Just be patient and know when she gets older and says she is exhausted - believe her. I had parents and family in my life call me lazy. At the time I did not have a diagnosis to back me up, but it is taken a lot of work to undo the damage of being told I am not physically trying hard enough when in reality I had an actual illness holding me back. Best of luck, momma \u2764\ufe0f I think that foods high in iron are the answer, not iron supplements. The iron in supplement form causes harm for people beta thal because their bodies cannot integrate the iron properly in when it comes in concentrated doses. I know that this is true because I have seen the negative effects in my daughter when I attempted to give her iron supplements. Just do not do it! \nI can tell you what has worked for us. I purchase liver supplements which are basically just dried beef liver in gel caps. These are super helpful! She takes 3 or 4 each day. Thanks! Thanks! This makes a lot of sense, appreciate it! Thanks! Thanks! Your body is low on iron because it cannot process it. No point trying to cram it in artificially.\n\nI have never taken iron supplements. People in my family have been put on them over the years by misguided but well meaning doctors and have got sick.\n\nJust get on with life, and maybe pick one or two high iron foods that you can remember to integrate into your diet regularly, and forget about it. &gt;Reference Range:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Adult males:\u00a0 30-300 ng/mL  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Adult females:\u00a0 10-200 ng/mL  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Newborns:\u00a0 25-200 ng/mL  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2264 1 month:\u00a0 200-600 ng/mL  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2-5 months:\u00a0 50-200 ng/mL  \n&gt;  \n&gt;6 months-15 years:\u00a0 7-142 ng/mL\n\nShe is still within range so I probably would not do it. Doctors used to prescribe it to me when I was a kid and 1) it was useless and 2) it really made me sick. In any case I would try and find another hematologist, just in case. You are welcome! A 9.7 is not too bad compared to me :) mine usually is in the 8s. When I was pregnant it dropped as low as 6.2 and I still did not need a transfusion. You will get to know what her normal is.\n\nEdit to add: if you are in the US you are going to come across MANY doctors that do not know anything about it. I only just recently came across a doctor that had heard of it, but still did not know much. It usually freaks them out when they see our hemoglobin numbers lol. Man, I could have written this myself!! I am sorry you also dealt with the doubt of other people. It has made it so hard to not feel guilty as an adult. I always feel like I need to do more and like I cannot use my thal as an \"excuse\". I also have ADHD and was not diagnosed until college. Interesting that your Ritalin helps with fatigue. I havent been medicated in years but was already planning to try again once I am done breastfeeding. That would be a huge plus!\n\nOP, if you are in the US, you are likely going to come across doctors that tell you that beta thal minor carries no symptoms. That is not true for all of us. Please believe her when she tells you what she is feeling! If you do, go food based and not ferrous.", "Why do doctors all seem to think it is asymptomatic Why do most doctors seem to believe that beta thalassemia minor does not cause any symptoms other than mild anemia? My daughter has it. She inherited it from her father. She was jaundice shortly after birth, has had unexplainable GI issues since birth. She was the crankiest baby I have ever seen. She is Always had a sluggish immune system. It takes 3-5 rounds of antibiotics and trips to the doctor to get rid of any infection she is ever had such as Strep or an ear infection. She is seen many doctors and specialists. She is 12 and has elevated blood pressure and high triglycerides. We do not eat out and I usually prepare healthy meals. I am convinced that everything is related to Beta Thalassemia Minor. But, no one seems to believe me. It is a really old notion because someone said it 40 years ago and no one ever questioned it.\n\nHere is a thread I posted: (\n\nBest thing you can do with thal minor is to live as healthy as you can and take supplements like (multi-)vitamin C,D,B12 and others if needed.\n\nBut talk to your doctor and get bloodwork done before so you know how much and what to take.\n\nIt will take a while to figure out because what helps some might not help others.\n\nMake sure she is not deficient in iron.\n\nTheres also much information on a website called \"Thalassemia Patients and Friends\".\n\ngood luck!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: this thread has a lot of great information! ( Thank you for the links! She is 13 and has always been iron deficient. She was originally diagnosed in 2019 by her GI doctor, but he said she did not need a referral to a hematologist.  Her pediatrician did not really say much about it either. We recently found a new pediatrician. The new doctor actually ordered new blood work to verify the original diagnosis. We just got those results back. So she is referring her to a hematologist. Hopefully we will be on the right track to get her what she needs. They are just behind the times. And I imagine most family docs/PCPs are not really all that well-read on the condition.\n\nThere have been studies confirming that thal minors have symptoms (such as fatigue). But it does not seem to be knowledge all doctors have learned. They also told my mom when I was a newborn that I did not have thal.... (Newborns often cannot be diagnosed with thal for a certain amount of time). Figured it out in my teenage years when I was struggling with fatigue and my gramma told me, \"Hey you know our family has this thing\". I was like what?! Since then I keep having doctors be like \"We think you have iron deficiency\" because they do not understand my condition and my blood tests prove them wrong each time.\n\nYou will have to do a certain amount of self-education and advocation for your daughter, unfortunately. Yes, there are def symptoms that thal minors have. I actually just had a follow up with a hematologist today. It was really just nice to have validation that our symptoms are in fact real. Her rec was to take 1mg of folic acid a day as an adult. It is important to rule out iron def anemia as well as that can certainly co-occur. My GP said the same thing when my hemoglobin came back low; you need iron! I had to remind her again that I have beta thal trait. Def keep advocating for her \u2764\ufe0f I have beta thalassemmia minor and am in medical school. We have to learn thousands of conditions, and can only remember a certain amount of well known, proven information related to each of them. With BTM, we are only taught that symptoms are mild; that is it. You cannot expect a GP to be an expert on every condition. A hematologist might have a better understanding, but even then, you cannot expect them to know the ins and outs of a disease that from the outside looks like a minor inconvenience. \n\nDo you own research and advocate for your daughter, but be realistic. \n\nAs for her symptoms, many infants are jaundiced shortly after birth. The body takes time to increase the enzyme that processes bilirubin. With the GI and immune issues, she may need further testing because I am not sure how those could be related to BTM. Best of luck. I do understand that most doctors are not specialists. But, after her diagnosis the GI nor her pediatrician thought she even needed a referral to the hematologist. Her new pediatrician verified results and gave a referral.\n\nI do think it is really odd that her symptoms are similar, yet very, very mild versions of some of the symptoms my step-cousin experienced growing up. He had Beta Thalassemia Major. \n\nI am not saying that her symptoms can even come close to comparing in severity with his. He was extremely ill and eventually did succumb to the illness. I just know that her symptoms are vaugly similar. Which is why I feel they could be related. Can you go into more detail about her GI symptoms? And how frequently would you say she gets infections? Have they ruled out thalassemia intermedia?\n\nAlso, some more basic information about your daughter would help. Her age, height and weight, etc.\n\nIf you continue to see symptoms, I would definitely consider taking her to someone else. You mentioned her new pediatrician offered a referral. I definitely sympathize though. I have had sleep and fatigue issues my entire life. Unexplained blood in my urine on multiple occasions. I have learned a bunch during my studies, but it is difficult to get concrete answers for a lot of things. I am not a carrier. Her doctor sent a referral in 2 days ago and said a hematologist with would be reaching out.\n\nGI symptoms have been lifelong issues with constipation. It was severe when was an infant and toddler. It is gradually improved. She also has gets and frequently complains of stomach pain. She is had a full GI workup including an endoscopy and full labs. \n\nShe is was sick constantly. Strep, ear infections, MRSA, stomach viruses, the flu. Any type of infection takes round after round of antibiotics. She used to get random fevers periodically for no know reason. That has not happened recently.\n\nShe is 13 now. She is 5'4 and weights 120lbs. She also has high triglycerides and elevated blood pressure. Her alkaline phosphatase was also just at the high edge of normal. It was 258. There is a spectrum of symptoms related to B Thalassemia minor but the ones you mention are very unlikely to be caused by it. If you have B Thal your  red blood cells are smaller and your body needs to work harder and produce more than to compensate for it. So you might feel sluggishness and energy depleted if you are not getting adequate nutrition and stimulation. You have to eat better and exercise more than the average person but that is about it. It is a simple genetic mutation on the HBB gene that does not affect your GI system or your immune system. Yes, the liver, pancreas and gall bladder technically are not part of the GI system. They are accessory organs that do have an affect on the GI system and vise versa. These are all organs that can be affected by B-Thal minor. Red blood cells\u00a0also do more carry oxygen from our lungs to our organs. They also help fight infections.\n\n Consult a gastroenterologist on the subject. Late to the party but I hope this info makes it to you.\n\nVit D 50,000iu once a week for 3 mos &amp; check serum 25-OH levels after 90days to evaluate if supplements need to be continued for another 90days, then retested. (Rinse/repeat until optimal levels are achieved) Make sure to take the supplement with fat. \n\nAdd daily L-Glutamine and probiotics.\n\nI take Vit D as needed to keep my levels up and A capsule of L-glutamine. I consume probiotics via kefir, yogurt, raw milk &amp; kombucha.\n\nThe vitamin D protocol I described was used in two studies: School children in Mexico and at a Veterans Affairs facility. Additionally I tried it on myself letting my doctor know and she was on board. Watched my levels jump. Low Phosphates goes hand in hand with the low vitamin D. Level might increase when you increase Vit D. \n\nGastro issues? Yep. GERD and IBS-A. Gastro doc wanted to put me on a SNRI (I am already on a SSRI and I said hell no). Was scoped on both ends and did not learn anything new, just got the diagnosis on paper.  L-glutamine has helped so much. \n\nB vitamins and iron (if she can have iron, take it on an empty stomach with 1000mg Vit C. Be careful, some forms of iron will cause gastric issues) should improve energy and immune function. If she has an issue with the MTHFR gene, vitamin B/folate might not be able to get utilised to the full capacity as her body might have problems with methylation. The workaround is to use a methylated version. Prenatal vitamins are great source  for trace minerals and B vitamins/folate. \n\nVitamin B/folate feeds mitochondria and the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. \n\nI would get chronic infections as a child. Immune system lazy...I recently learned this because I found out I was not immune from the MMR vaccines I got as a kid. Recently got immune from a 3rd vaccine, because I had to get proof of immunity to start working on more medical school stuff in college and it was a requirement for admission.\n\nEdit: a-/a-", "How long should I take Folic acid?

They have 4.5 mg per shake (25% dv). Is it ok to drink one per day? Totally depends on what your iron levels are currently.  If you have had transfusions previously or were incorrectly prescribed iron treatment, your iron might be high and then it should be avoided (as much as possible).   If you have a hematologist ask them to run an iron panel, or your GP could run it for you too.  It is also possible for thal minors to have iron deficiency, and then the extra iron would be good for you.\n\nBut no matter what you do, some foods will always have iron in them.  I just try to check the labels before I buy something like a protein, cereal or vitamins so I am not unnecessarily adding to my iron since mine is high. Can you eli5 why iron is bad for thalassemia? I have the version with no symptoms and no transfusions. I am in the same boat not a doctor or an expert but AFAIK the reason is that the body does not have many effective ways to process and discard excess iron.\nMost of the iron should travel your body in red blood cells which are less or less efficient when you have thalassemia, so extra iron ends up in the rest of your body.\n Excess iron is bad for tissues in particular the liver which gets overworked trying to process it, as well as some other organs plus in high quantities its toxic. Same. I know my iron is low but I do not trust the doctor I had as a kid who prescribed me supplements because they never even explained what thalassemia was and I have spent my life trying to piece it together myself (Thankfully information online is a lot easier to understand than when I was in high school). Unfortunately without insurance I do not really know what to do about it presently but I did feel sick on the supplements which I have seen others similarly wrongly prescribed citing as well so I have opted to stop taking them until I can find a doctor that I trust more to help.", "Is the Wim Hoff suitable for thalassemia minors? Hey there, I recently found out about the Wim Hof breathing exercises which apparently make the body produce more blood cells and some other things regarding oxygen in your blood. Could this be problematic for people with thal? Never heard of it, and sounds a bit iffy to me.\n\nTechnique aside, I was under the impression that we have more red blood cells but some of them are smaller in size and because they are small they do not carry as much haemoglobin to carry oxygen. \n\nExercise should make you produce more red blood cells. Some effects have quite some scientific evidence, ( But anyway, so more red blood cells are a good thing even for us? That is basically what I wanted to know! Probably no effect. But an argument could be made that by making more red bloods it forces our body to work harder to clean it out, because I think the smaller ones die quicker. By body I mean spleen. Some people get enlarged spleens with this trait. Probably negligible though and just a hypothesis and I am just speaking out of my arse with no scientific research to back what I said. \n\nEither way I do not think more red blood cells is bad.

I was always under the impression that you cannot, but I recently had some bloodwork done and had *low* MCH and MCV levels and have anemia. Does this mean it is not minor, or is it still possible to have anemia with thalassemia minor? I do not have low iron either. It is normal to have low levels of MCV and MCHC if you have beta thalassemia minor...Also it is normal to have some symptoms like anemia. That is good to hear. I definitely should have asked more questions at the appointment but I was so flustered because I have always had symptoms of anemia but always wrote them off as something else, and they were never that bad so I never bothered looking into it. Thanks for the help! Thalassemia is one cause of microcytic anemia (&lt; 80 MCV). MCH being low is also pretty normal. It all depends on the exact levels. Got it, okay good to know. I found out about this diagnosis super young due to other health issues, but they always just said it was asymptomatic. It was not until I found this reddit that I started realizing it is not uncommon to have symptoms with just the trait. Thanks for the help! from a symptom perspective I suffer from lack of stamina, there is no way i could jog for more than a couple of minutes. Have you tried... jogging more? On this sub everyone seems to have a \"symptom\" that they say is related to Thal minor when most are probably unrelated. Oh man I have tried; I work out 6 days a week but the red blood cells of a Thal patient just do not carry oxygen very well I do get light-headed after a heavy workout (And have all my life). I have kind of attributed that to having Thal. I never really tried running since the lightheadedness was pretty bad... until recently. I swear after a couple of months of running somewhat consistently I have not really felt that lightheadedness as much... And am able to run much farther than I had thought I could.  Good to know :) Too bad I also have a bad ankle :( Yeah can confirm. I did varsity sports and managed to keep up... but eventually realized that no one else was struggling like I was. It was a completely different ballgame for me. I have since given up all high intensity training because it destroys me, and I am way less exhausted and messed up all the time now. So, everyone feel free to keep training but by god it is not always simple. If you cannot jog for a couple of minutes then there is something wrong with you, and it is not beta thalassemia minor. I agree. I never feel rested and sometimes feel wiped after a mile run or playing a few games of basketball, which I suspect might have something to do with BTM, but it is never stopped me from keeping up with everyone else.\n\nI think a lot of people just like to use it as an excuse. No problem, just eat well, exercise and sleep that is all you can do! I also cannot run for more than a few minutes without losing my breathe.  Do not understand why others have to disagree.  No one ever told me it was from lack of oxygen till I ended up in online thalassemia groups. I have Thal minor. All the doctors ever say is that I have nothing to worry about.  They never explain all the symptoms a person could have. \\*shrug\\*  different people experience some different symptoms i guess... Sounds like beta thalassemia minor affects everyone differently.

Unsure about medical costs, insurance, etc. Long story short I am 19 and I am from a country where health care has been provided to me free of charge throughout my whole life, meaning I have been able to have regular blood transfusions whenever I needed them and my Exjade is fully paid by the government.\n\nI have been wondering for some time how life would look for me if I moved to the United States, there is many things about the country's health care and health insurance policies that confuse me and I want to know if moving to the States in the future (after 4+ years from now) would be a possibility.\n\nThose of you from America, what do your expenses look like? What kind of health insurance do you utilize and what do the costs look like? Are you able to get regular blood transfusions, and are you paying for each one? What about Exjade, does health insurance provide you with the needed pills? I also have thalassemia and I get blood transfusions every four weeks and I am on combination Jadenu (the revamped exjade) and desferal. All this to say I chose the insurance with the highest monthly premium payment and the lowest deductible. In my case I pay ~$550/month and the deductible is ~$1,500 for the year before the insurance kicks in fully and I do not have to pay anything else besides the monthly premium. \n\nI am able to get blood transfusions and doctors appointments when I need them and getting iron chelation drugs is only tricky in the beginning since the doctor usually has to send in a prior authorization. Depending on how quickly they work you will usually start getting supplies in a month or less. \n\nThe not great thing is that the yearly cost is quite high, about $8,000 total. Also, dealing with insurance companies can be a real pain. On the bright side, I never really have to worry about getting a blood transfusion or the necessary drugs (as long as I am insured haha). Without insurance the costs are astronomical. One blood transfusion with two units of blood is about $7,000. Sooo... yikes. \n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to message me.  Sorry, all I know of insurance is its crazy and expensive. Wife works in medical and the way things work now is just crazy. Between the cost of insurance and things in your medical file being used against at a later day by other doctors I just avoid insurance, doctors and all that. Even if I could afford medical insurance, I would not understand how to use it properly, I would not be able to afford the co-pays and deductibles. If I did happen to need go to a doctor thelack of understand and the time to takes to find out any of this would cause me to avoid the extra expense of going to a doctor.  This is very helpful! Thank you! At what age did you have to get insurance? When you started working? Or since a child? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I just cannot wrap my head around a lot of these things and the US is even more complicated than it should be. I have essentially had to have it my whole life since I was diagnosed and started treatments at birth. It is just had to change from being under my parents' names to under my name once I was old enough that I could no longer stay on theirs. And yes, the insurance system around here is super complicated and convoluted. What country are you thinking of moving from? I live in Bulgaria. I will be applying for a Software Engineering Bachelor's degree in a local university next month which, if I get accepted, will take 4 years to complete.

I am simply curious about what living in America would look like for me. My father worked there throughout my whole childhood basically, at one point he applied for citizenship (I believe) and he got it, so I might ask around to see if this could be helpful for me.

My uncle (dad's brother) lives there, my two half brothers both live there, but obviously my situation is different, having a health condition.\n\nTo keep it real, even though I do not know much about it, America's health care system looks notoriously messed up. I guess I am very lucky to be receiving the treatment I have been receiving since I was born either free of charge or only having to pay for minor things. Only recently have I started realizing this and not taking it for granted, also makes me very sad how in some countries the rich are going to always be the first to be taken care of in case anything bad happened, while the poor may not be able to even afford basic care and die as a result.\n\nAnyways, if I end up getting my degree in SE and become good at software development, I will probably have pretty good chances at landing a job in a foreign country. The most attractive idea about the US is a) the weather in some states (there are many great countries in Europe, but they also happen to be cold af,) b) the pay that people working on software get c) the savings/investment plans that you guys have over there d) food e) different experiences, also many states which have substantial differences from each other. Obviously, there are cons, from what I have heard in many of the states I might be interested in, housing is very expensive, cost of living is high, people can be weird (like everywhere else in the world), there is corruption (like everywhere else in the world)\n\nAnyways, this is already super long, thank you again for being super helpful! if you are enrolled in a US university there will be a requirement to join their insurance plan so you would be covered during college. Anything IT related is in super high demand so you will surely be able to get hired after graduation, an benefits will be great, meaning you will have insurance!", "Gaining muscle with thalassemia Hi everyone. Hope you guys are doing well. I am 25(M) and I have beta thalassemia major and I go for transfusions regularly (after a span of three weeks each) and am also taking chelation in suitable dosage. My ferritin stays near 1000 and pre transfusion hb lingers around 9. I am almost 165 cm and weigh around 50.  Ideally I should weigh around 60 so need to put up lots of muscle. I  usually would go for a brisk walk or jog and do some free hand exercises but have not engaged in weight training as such. Has anyone with thalassemia major here tried resistance training and successfully gained considerable  muscle? If yes then kindly tell me about your journey and the problems you faced, especially those which were exclusive to you being a thalassemia major and if not then what was the problem that you got stuck at.  Thanks in advance. Take care everyone. \nPeace. Hello, I am beta thalassemia minor, 32 years old, 170 cm and 70kg. You might think my BMI is good but sadly it is mostly fat with very little muscles. I learned after years of working out that my body does not like to keep muscles at all. I technically can lift weights, look bigger and get stronger to an extent but if I stopped lifting for a couple of days I lose my progress very quickly. \n\nIt makes sense to me since you can break down your muscles by working out but to recover we need blood and we have smaller blood cells which means we are not recovering. \n\nThe catch is if you have any type of anemia you are at risk of having severe muscles loss the older you get. Just look at us we are frail, bag of bones in our 20\u2019s what do you think we going to look like in our 60\u2019s so you need to workout everyday. After accepting the fact that you will never have a bodybuilder\u2019s body find a routine that is mix of strength and cardio at the same time like swimming or HIIT. My routine now is 30 minutes cardio and 30 minutes kettlebell routine that works out my whole body. I am not gaining or muscle or getting bigger but at least I get to keep what I have.", "IDA Depression and Thalessemia How do you solve an iron deficiency without iron supplements? \n\nI feel like my mental health has been horrendous the last 10 months or so. It is getting pretty bad.\n\nAnyone? Ugh this hit me hard.\n\nI was diagnosed when I was an 8 month old baby. I am 22 now. Ever since I was small I was battling depression and anxiety. But I never told anyone because of all the misinformation around depression in the Asian community. \n\nJust 2 days ago I finally told my haematologist. It got pretty serious because I started getting memory loss and the depression started getting worse and worse also the anxiety is getting worser. I am good at hiding how I feel and apparently that is High Functioning Anxiety. Where you look completely fine on the outside but from the inside it is a mess.\n\nI have been referred to a Psychologist and Psychiatric. I have also been trying to muster up the courage to tell my mum about the depression and anxiety but I have told her about the memory loss. Hopefully everything goes well from now on.\n\nI have a friend who is also Beta Thalassemia Major and she has also been experiencing memory loss, depression and anxiety. She lives in a different country from me. I live in England and she lives in Malaysia. I feel like alot of Thalassemia paitents struggle with this but are afraid to voice it. \n\nI hope you tell your Hematologist about this and get the appropriate help you need. I am praying for you. Please keep me updated :)\n\nFor the iron Deficiency I think you should ask your haematologist to refer you to a dietitian. I suggest eating lots of green vegetables and red meat. Basically the things I should be avoiding due to high iron levels \ud83d\ude02 I get memory loss too! Sometimes I feel so stupid, but I can hardly remember anything! Glad to know I am not the only one. \u2764\ufe0f Definitely tell your haematologist at your next appointment and have them refer you to a specialist to check it out. It is better to be safe than sorry. \ud83e\udd7a I will. I am going to pressure my hematologist. I have a psychiatrist and a psychologist already. Antidepressants do not seem to do jack shit.

I thought I would grow out of it. I just thought I was a anxious child but I guess not talking about what is going on got me to such a point where I am so lonely despite having a massive family.\n\nI am so happy that you have gotten the support you need. Hopefully I also get the support I need.\n\nI hope you and your children are always happy and healthy.\n\nThank you for replying to me. I feel less alone now. Thank you.

For reference, I am a few years younger than you with thalassemia and my values are 10.2, 64, and 31.1 respectively. I will preface this by saying I am not a doctor and can only offer my laymen opinion. Your numbers are too close to normal to insinuate thalassemia minor. The thal. minor numbers are not like \"oh those are slightly odd.\" They are like \"whaaat on earth, why are all my numbers seriously messed up!\" For example, MCV is way off and you may also have a higher limit / or much higher red blood count. You have similar results to me and I originally thought I had Thal but mine was from chronic disease and blood loss over 2 years . I am greek so I was a little worried but my doctor informed me my mcv and mch would be a lot lower than just a few points below normal if it was Thal No symptoms as such. Would you be able to tell what caused your blood loss. I had a colonoscopy done for some other reason but it did not show anything. I have colitis and was bleeding for awhile before finally getting on a good diet and fixing it .

Do any fellow thalassemia beta runners have issues with their heart rate when running? \n\nMale aged 38, for reference.  \n\nI normally run 5K about 2-3 times a week and it is not uncommon for my heart rate to peak at 190 and even 200+ when hill running. I realise that this may be an issue with my HR monitor but I was also wondering if there is a correlation between our condition and higher heart rates when exercising?   \n\nThanks! i am not too surprised, that makes total sense.   I do not even try to run, just get too exhausted. Yeah mine seems to spike that high too, even higher than my boyfriend who has CF. I just try to listen to my body and not mind the monitor and if I feel like it is pounding too hard or I am getting too tired I lower it. I try to do interval training rather than one consistent difficulty. I have never heard of this before. Such a high heart rate for some one at 38 and getting those numbers on a regular basis seems unusual. I would first suspect your measurement source. If it is an optical watch I would not rely on it. Better a heart rate strap around the chest. Yes! 30F, found out I have beta thal 2 weeks ago. I have always had chest pains, even went to see cardiologist years ago. They ignored and belittled me for having anxiety, never returned for the stress test. I do have anxiety, but I know the difference.\n\nMy husband always complains I run too slow. \ud83e\udd23 We found out last year after getting Apple watches, I normally hit 190 running after about half a mile in -no matter the incline. Yep abnormally high rate but in my case I have beta thal major so I get my transfusions and then that seems to go away because the Hb is again normal, and yeah I do not run rather I cycle for around 20km per day and if you ask me do not abandon your routine of you think you can manage to do it, really helps. I dont run but even just sitting down my pulse is at 140 \ud83d\ude2d", "Can thalassemia cause underrating? I still need to get to a specialist.\nBut can a lower appetite be a symptom? While a loss of appetite is a symptom of anemia, it is not that which causes fatigue. In the case of thalassemia, our hemoglobin cells are small and misshapen, as such they are do not carry oxygen well. Add anemia to the mix then you have too few cells which are doing a shit job of carrying oxygen, leading to weakness and fatigue.  It is difficult to have an appetite when you feel weak and tired. So eating more would only help if I am deficient, thanks My 5 year old is currently like this. His hB reading is 7, used to be 8,9. And he worries me more when he does not eat much nowadays. Am wondering the same thing. Am thinking to give him lysine supplement. I feel like our metabolism as a whole can get sluggish from lack of oxygen. Bilirubin is what makes our poop brown, which comes from red blood cells. If you are lacking in it, it only makes sense that it is harder to digest some things. \n\nI do not think science knows enough about it yet, but there are some days I do not feel like eating because it feels like my body is still processing food from two days ago. It is hard to explain. \n\nIt is all a matter of maintaining balance. Take the proper vitamins to help build up your blood. Eat easy to digest food, even if it is not the healthiest. I try to stay away from bread. \n\nHope you feel better soon. I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO FELT THIS . I am sure it is a normal feeling for most people, but it makes sense thalassemia makes digestion difficult. I feel like I am either starving, or forcing food down. YES! Some days I only eat because I get a headache. Holy shit I cannot believe I am not alone.....people think I am crazy when I talk about this Am I the only person that tends to overeat? Usually when I am tired and start crashing I reach for sugary food to keep my awake or just make bad food choices. And I am usually tired a lot! I am not overweight or anything I have just never experienced the under eating part. You also have a lot more red blood cell to compensate for its smaller size, at least that the case with beta-thalassemia minor, so it should not really be an issue. Unless you are currently suffering from anemia. I find it kind of hard to believe that all these people with thalassemia complaining about fatigue are also anemic. In my case both these symptoms disappeared after I stared doing sports. I have been anemic all my life. I cannot speak for anyone else. Sports never helped for me. What is true for one person is not always true for everyone else.  I am so glad that sports helped your fatigue disappear.  Diet helps for others and yet others might find relief elsewhere. Playing sports makes my body ache and swell (a lot). Same happens when air temperature rises above 31 degrees. Sorry mate, I going to have to second that sport helps a lot with thal minor, basically cured all my symptoms. In fact I think sports is almost always good at improving your health if it is done correctly and in a appropriate way for you, so saying \"Sports never helped for me\" sounds like either you were not doing it right or you have other heath problems a lot more serious than just B thal minor. What kind of sports did you try? I do have other issues as well, but people can and often do sports with little effort.  I tried softball, tennis, swimming. I have never really been able to run much so that impeded me a lot.  I was extremely active as a child but the fatigue has always been there.", "Please tell me what should I do \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Hello My partner has thalassemia,\nShe had a miscarriage and had to do a DnC. \ud83d\ude2dIt has been about 2 months. \n\nSuddenly for the last 3 weeks she is having severe headaches...

I cannot find anything about it on the Internet and I am actually kind of worried. if you have only just found it, it is not life threatening. If anything, you will not notice anything different apart from maybe cold hands and getting more easily tired than other people (which you would have already noticed). \n\nWelcome! You can do most things like normal, but might have lower iron than other people (your blood just does not have enough hemoglobin to absorb it). I am waiting for my PCR results for mild alpha thalassemia and have really been struggling with fatigue. If you do not mind me asking, what supplements have you found effective? So far I have tried folic acid and multi vitamins but neither have helped much. My hemoglobin has gone down for the first time in a while. I am using Iron, B12, folic Acid, Vitamin D. For B12 I use 2 pills a day. Just take the supplements everyday, you may notice that your body going to a weird circle and that you get cold shiffering on your back, that is normal. Then eat loads of protein and do not skip a breakfast! After two months you feel so good and you have so much energy. I just notice that my friends that are normal, they are always tired from a workout and I just feel fine. Oh also work out and sleep at least 8 hours a day.

Hi all,\n\nJust wanted to give a slightly more positive view of Thalassemia minor.\n\nI am 28, Male, South East Asian origin. I have taken 4 blood tests between October 2018 and July 2019. \n\nHb - 130 - 180 (g/L) 142, 136, 127, 130   \n\nMy first reading in October because I had done lots of hiking in and around Yellowstone National park (90km + ) in September. Over the next 6 months my activity level dropped to pretty much sedentary and I am only now getting into exercise again using Couch to 5K on my Garmin watch just after my last blood test.\n\nHct( 0.4-0.54): 0.466, 0.45, 0.41, 0.42\n\nRCC( 4.5-6.5 \\*10\\^12)/L) :  **6.6**, 6.4, 6.0, 6.0  \n\nMCV (79-99): **69, 70 ,70, 70**\n\nMCH  (27-34): **21, 21, 21, 22**\n\nMCHC (320-360):  **310, 304, 307, 310**\n\nI am around 60kg, 168 cm. I used to do a lot of body weight exercise in my early 20s particularly because I climbed a lot (every 2nd day)\n\nGarmin says my V02 Max is 43 currently, although I am not sure how accurate that is. My fastest 5k was 3 years ago at 28min and my most recent 5k has been 32 min ( I was walking though partly). \n\nIn the blood test above I have not taken any supplements.\n\nI have always found it extremely easy to sleep.\n\nI wanted to post because over the last 6 months I have been stressed and anxious about my health as illustrated by the frequent visits to the doctor to get blood tests.  I have also been quite stressed at work. \n\nAfter that last blood test, I decided to start running again to reduce my cholesterol (5.6 mmol/L) and my blood pressure (avg. 135/90). Running has helped me immensely mentally around anxiety and I am feeling better about my health. I have also stopped coffee. (I used to do 1-2 short blacks a day)\n\nI have seen that lots of people here are recommending folic acid and other supplements. I think everyone is different but I really think that we always want a quick fix to things but all we really need is to keep active. I have started running again for 7 weeks. My resting heart rate is 52. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to provide a different perspective. I exercise too, weights and cardio. But folic acid is prescribed to help keep the red blood cells healthy. I would not really say that is a \u201cquick fix\u201d. Exercise is important for everyone, not just people with thalassemia. I have recently started mountain biking. Lots of uphill climbs and downhill adrenaline - insane workouts. Sometimes I will ride for 3 hours on trails and be put of breath the entire time.\n\nSince starting I have noticed I am sleeping better and my energy levels have felt soo much better.\n\nI used to get a slump in the afternoon every day that felt like all of a sudden my energy level dropped to zero and I would be physically exhausted.. that is gone too now.\n\nI am also taking folic acid and vitamin b50 once a day with breakfast as well.\n\nWill be checking my blood next week to see if there is an official difference! That is awesome you are able to get exercise. I normally take walks, but the heat index has been around 108 for the past week where I live. Which is very frustrating! I feel better too when I exercise. My Numbers are not as low as yours though. Keep up the good work. Crossfit here, never been better.

How do I not stay mentally demotivated? Thank you. My great-grandfather was a Greek man who was the source of our families fun with Beta Thal. Minor. He fought in WW2 and was a \"Golden Glove\" boxer. I wonder if he even knew he had Beta Thal. Minor. We only know, now, because of my grandmother. Anyhow, while Beta Thal. makes things more difficult, it does not make them impossible. You may have to work harder than 95% of people, only to be better than 70%. But, being better than 70% is not too shabby. I would work hard hard hard and not focus on limitations. Just my opinion. Do you have intermittent hemolytic crises or anemia? You would have to be careful with any antimalarial drugs or treatments that they try to administer to you. Antimalarial drugs are contraindicated for people with certain inherited hemoglobinopathies and genetic blood disorders. I was also considering enlisting in the military (I was in JROTC for 4 years, Ground School for 2 years, went to summer boot camps in preparation) but I always had issues meeting the running requirements. I was unaware that I have Beta Thalassemia, Dominant and G6PD Deficiency back then. Right before I graduated high school I was told that I had low iron, was chronically anemic, underweight, and hypoglycemic. I decided not to join because of these issues seemed to be made worse by physical exercise. My advice is to master the skills you have an edge up on the competition with to compensate for the areas where you may be limited due to Beta Thalassemia, try to stay in contract with groups like this for motivation, advice, or just to rant or feel connected, stay away from contraindicated meds like NSAIDS, sulfa based drugs, and antimalarial drugs, make sure you supplement with folic acid, zinc picolinate, and magnesium, B complex to help build up your red blood cells, try to avoid any foods/drinks/activities/meds that increases oxidative stress in the body. Learn as much as you can about Beta Thalassemia because you will have to educate your comrades, doctors, superiors because they probably will not know much about it. I wish you the best of luck and you got this! You are a strong person for willing to protect and serve while dealing with a chronic medical condition \ud83d\udc4a Thank you and your great-grandfather for his service, it is these breed of men and women with such achievements that inspire me. What you say about working harder than 95% of people resonated deeply. I run nearly everyday albeit at a slower pace and used to swim once a week until corona when the pools closed. It is tough to have few people or none to talk to about this condition that they can relate to. Thank you for your comment! Thanks for the reply! Like you, I was in my country's version of the JROTC for the years of my high school. I somehow seem to do better than the people without this condition but maybe it is just the level of commitment and dedication that I had (not that I was the most outstanding of individuals too). \nI did not know the information about the anti malarial drugs so that was helpful. \nFor context: I was diagnosed with Beta-thal minor when I was 5/6 years old and hospitalised for being really sick and testing on my parents showed that they (both of Southeast Asian descent) carried the gene as well. \nSince then I have not had any major anemia except feeling sleepy or lethargic for an hour or 2 after intense runs or work outs. \nG6PD screening also indicated present. \nSince my last blood test about a year ago, Hb levels were peak 12.8g/dL. To my knowledge, to qualify for joining is 13.5g/dL for males. I know of friends (from highschool) that had high (16-17.0g/dL)readings and were selected to attend special warfare operator qualification training. \nI take folic acid 5mg daily along with BCAA supplements for muscles recovery as I train almost everyday with varying intensities on alternate days, trying to cut down on run timings as much as I can. \nThank you for your encouragement &amp; being very informative and no matter where I end up, I promise to do my best. I was in the military with thalassemia, you will be disqualified from any air jobs but otherwise they wont even test for it. dm  me if you have any questions Which Army? Depends on the role, I would say go for it. Though you might have lower vo2max than others, these tests are not that hard and most of the barriers are in your head. Thank you for your service!

I have confirmed they do indeed test for it in my case.", "Brain fog and driving Hello!\n\nI have hemoglobin H Disease a form of alpha thalassemia (hemoglobin level 8, moderately severe anemia). \n\nI am just wondering if anyone has brain fog as a symptom of their thalassemia, and how do you handle driving?\n\nI am terrified to learn how to drive because I would hate to injure someone on the road due to a spell of brain fog.\n\nIn relation to my brain fog, I tend to zone out during day to day activities. I sometimes end up walking into things or not even thinking when I am crossing the road (lol).\n\nI know you can argue if you are concentrating then you will not zone out, but I imagine it is more than possible when driving.\n\nI would love to hear your experiences. Hello fellow HbH. In term of my Hemoglobin level, it hover around the 9.5-11, mostly in the 10 ballpark. I am in my late 30s and have been driving for about 20 years now\n\nBut to your question of do I get brain fog, absolutely. Do I feel fatigued quite often absolutely too. Do I get migraines due to lack of blood-flow to my brain, more often than I wished. \n\nIn regards to driving, yes there has been cases where I had zoned out and had  'crap where the heck am I moment' and 'aw shoot, I just ran a stop-sign/red-light did not I...' and 'oh crap, that was a close call with that pedestrian/cyclist/car..' Luckily, knock on wood, nothing bad has actually happened so far, just mainly wasted gas and prolong driving time due to my infamous detour needs. \n\nAs for my solution, I am highly dosed up on caffeine, chocolate &amp; sugar and lastly I just learn not to drive when I am on one of those mindless states, generally this is more when I am fatigued, tired, dealing with a headache.  In having a real and tangible solution to the problem, unfortunately I do not have it. But I had just learned to know your body and the signs on when you are capable of driving. I have pieces of sugar candies like Starburst, Hi-Chew and the like around quite often just for that little boost of energy needed to get that concentration going enough for the drive or life in general. And for road-trip and such, I just pull over at rest-stops and gas stations often for naps, stretches, etc. Another tad-bit I found that helped in paying attention to driving is drive a manual transmission, the constant need to clutch and gear shift help to keep you focused somewhat. The few times, I had to drive an automatic transmission, I ended up speeding without knowing and ended up at odd places that requires re-routing consistently. \n\nOverall thought, driving should be ok and feasible if you are comfortable with it. But like I said, personal comfort level and self-awareness is key. Hello!\n\nThank you for taking the time to write such a detailed post. That is some solid advice about driving I will definitely keep it in mind. \n\nTouch wood things stay good for you on the road! \ud83d\ude07", "Related or something else?

I think is one of the symptoms post covid 19 infection . Or due to low oxygenation in tissue (muscles brain ) anyway that just an hypothesis. Yes. Damn it. When I am working my hands shake when concentrating my hand shakes. Also when I get hungry this becomes worse. I think hunger is a huge trigger. But, it also happens randomly when reaching for stuff.", "COVID Vaccines Has anyone with either version of thalassemia received a COVID-19 vaccine? I have beta minor and I have had my vaccine - pfizer. No issues I have alpha thal and got my first dose of moderna last week. My arm really hurt after awhile and I felt very sleepy, but it went away after a day Beta minor. Had Pfzier.\n\nFirst shot no issues, just arm pain in the place of the shot. Second shot I had terrible headache and sore muscles all over the body. It all went away 24-48hrs after the shot I just had Acetaminophen, water and rest Beta minor, I had Pfizer! No real issues. The second shot had body aches and nausea but went away in a day! thal beta minor with pfizer, no issues got my first shot a little over a week ago and besides a sore arm, no issues. believe i am beta minor. Alpha minor, pfizer both doses. no side effects Beta minor, pfzier.\n\nI have only had the first dose so far but I will be getting my second in a couple of weeks. Felt like a regular shot during the first day, nothing of note, but after the second day for me I felt the arm where I received it start to get sore, and it almost looked as if a bruise was forming where I had the injection. It hurt a bit to move my arm, but that was only the peak of the pain, a day or two later it was gone and after a complete week since then I can tell you all that stuff has passed over", "Questions for preschooler's appointment? We are seeing a hemotologist tomorrow for my 3yo whose PCP believes she has Thalassemia Trait... She has chronic low iron and has been on a supplement.  Her energy does seem improved by it (it has not seemed to affect her negatively).  Doctor said the only issue would be if she someday had children with a partner who also had the trait. \n\nAre there any questions I might ask at her appointment to learn more? \n\nThings I am wondering : \nAny symptoms now or could arise?\nAny dietary changes that are recommended?\nAny diseases associated with this? \nWhat discussion type does she have? \nAny developmental/behavioral (sleep, appetite, etc) effects? \n\nThanks In advance for any thoughts you may have. If she has trait it is fine. Usually,  people with thalassemia trait are asymptomatic. In terms of health, people who are trait carriers live a normal healthy life. \n\nIf she wants to have kids in the future she and her partner would need to get tested for the trait. She could have Alpha thalassemia trait or beta thalassemia trait. They would have to do a an electrophoresis and/or DNA test to confirm the type of thalassemia. It is very rare for couples to have the same gene mutations. Awesome, thanks for the info! I appreciate your response.", "How did Thal affect your careers or life goals? Since my brother passed from Thal earlier this year, I am struggling to find a motivation to live with Thal too.  I do not feel like I am good enough, every opportunity I have taken seems to fail. How do I get out of this grunt? How are other Thal warriors managing life and careers? I had to take up writing, because I cannot have a full time job. It is a rewarding hobby that I hope turns into something someday. I am sorry about your brother. My condolences. Always wanted to join the military, specifically the Indian Air Force but later realized I could not die to being diagnosed as b thal major, currently am a doctor. At times I feel like I am having a crisis because I love teaching young children but it is absolutely draining, there is only so long I can do it for before I need to change up my career.\n\nI think when it comes to being in a rut, you just need to remember you have something positive you can share with the world, it is just about finding it. I have no choice financially but to work full time but I had a lot of trouble in school growing up because I was just exhausted and could not focus and my family wasnt treating my thal properly How did you become doc? Was it hard? (Ovb it is regardless but I am wondering) Yeah well, I actually had to fight a case in the Supreme court of India along with Mr. Sukhsohit Singh (you can Google him he is famous) because apparently the medical council thought that a patient will not have the medical empathy and sense of reliability that an otherwise healthy doctor would have, I won the case and there was a interview to make sure that I had in me what it takes to become a doctor and since I was one of the highest ranking individuals in NEET (Medical entrance test of India) they could not make anymore objections. Once inside the Medical college it took a toll on my body as I was constantly working with doctors and patients or I was studying, that was a really hectic phase as I was skipping meals, skipping on my meds, skipping on my exercises and delaying my transfusions. Nevertheless it ended and then I did my specialization in MS General Surgery, currently am a surgeon in Ruby Hall Hospital Pune (do come visit me if you come to pune), the patients here are nice, the staff is friendly, and the pay is handsome so right now life is good. Thank you. Writing is great therapy. I wish you all the best in your writing endeavors. Thank you. I am sure being a doctor is more rewarding. It is unfortunate we cannot always do what we want knowing this illness can kill us if we do it. Patients make the best doctors. We have the empathy to heal or care for others as we ourselves know how it feels to suffer. You are an inspiration! I am sorry to hear of your struggles. I am in a similar situation. My brother died due not receiving proper treatments in a timely manner. Also, what made it harder for the both of us is my family was in too much disbelief and just did not know how to be with us. Now that his gone, they treat me as if my Thal is going to kill me tomorrow. I am already having a hard grasping school and now this. It is unbearable. Teaching young kids sounds tiresome yet fun. Nonetheless, being positive is a great mindset to have,  it hard to be positive now but I wish to get there one day and hope it weather away all this misfortune and exhaustion. Yeah at one point of time I was really disoriented and depressed as my doctors were like, how are you alive you should have died by now (extremely irritating when coming from a doctor) which still happens, everyone was like sympathizing with me when I tried to tell that am not weaker than them, could not play much sports like my friends, then there was my health cause whenever my transfusions were delayed by a week I could not even stand up due to weakness.        \n\n\n\n\n\nBut I can testify that if try to manage your body as best you can and have enough determination to do something and let thal not be your identity then you will succeed. It is rewarding to see my thal patients being inspired by the fact that am nearly 30 and yet I am working and riding my superduke while being issued speed tickets every day,  hahahaha. Yeah I sometimes wonder where I would be if I had thal major instead of minor or something worse (my boyfriend for instance has cystic fibrosis and I just legitimately cannot picture my family helping me the way he has especially into adolescence and adulthood).\n\nI am so sorry for your loss and for all of the heavy stress the impact is bringing to you. I hope you are able to find a balance somehow with all of it one day :( My biggest struggle from it has been the jaundice associated with it. Really only part of my life it affects. I climb trees full time and fun a business, no issues.  Perhaps I would be less tired without b-thal, but I think it would be worse if I had a job that was not so physically demanding. I have Beta Thal major and I recently started my own business (30yo)! It was and still is definitely a challenge - I choose to be open and honest with my customers about transfusions and my thal life because sometimes I am not performing at my best. \n\nYou just do what you can, do not compare yourself and work on it little by little. We can do everything everyone else can. If you have a dream career do not stop working on getting there. It may take a little more time and effort but we are already so much stronger than everyone else just because of everything we already deal with! \n\nIf you ever need any advice just send me a dm!", "headaches and nosebleed frequently, anyone else? i(19f) was just diagnosed with thal minor (not sure alpha or beta had to call and leave a message for my doctor lol) but its kind of been the missing piece to the puzzle, always felt very fatigued and weak even discussed it with my doctor extensively, always wrote it off to working too much and needing rest. I have always been very pale etc. most of the symptoms were not severe in any sense.\n\n(TMI) however i had really bad problem with nosebleeds specifically i would get extremely heavy nosebleed at the exactly same time as my period every week, its gotten better but now i always get headaches during my period.\n\njust wondering if maybe someone else has experienced this with thalassemia? they are probably unrelated just thought id ask since it deals with blood! haha\n\nalso any recommendations to help with fatigue? I get the same!! 21f I had the nosebleeds and I also had problems with passing out during my period during my teens so much the school nurses thought I was faking it until I cracked my head on a sink!  \nNow I constantly get migraines during my time of the month 22F \n\nI am no help on dealing with the fatigue. Having a routine helps some as does being caffeinated I (34m) have thal minor and used to get nosebleeds frequently in my teens and headaches for the majority of my life. I would wake up at 3am just in time for a nosebleed to start. The headaches i think are due to sinus issues (had several surgeries), but i might have a trick for the nosebleeds. Its gross, but a doctor had me swab my nose with neosporin periodically to keep it hydrated and it did help a great deal. I had a deviated septum and ultimately had to fix that surgically. My brother, who had even worse nosebleeds than me, had to have his the insides of his  nostrils cauterized at least twice. For him, he had to have surgery (that as my mom described it) involved scraping his sinuses. He is also thal minor. I dont know if any of this is related, but its kind of wild you have the same complaints we had growing up.  I would caution you to think long and hard about ever fixing things with surgery though, try everything else first. His nosebleeds were AWFUL and so were/are my headaches. nosebleeds were really common as a kid but stopped around the age 18 or so mine stopped around 18 as well Same. Alpha trait carrier.", "Dealing with Fatigue! I suffer from thalassemia minor and over the past few years, i have gotten noticeably more tired (i have done a couple of blood tests, and its not great, but not horrible either). It has reached a point where I cant get through a day without falling asleep mid-day (I literally end up getting 12 hours of sleep per day). Initially I have tried adjusting so many things like my routine, diet, exercise, but none of them sleep to make me feel energized. I feel so lethargic/fatigued all the time. Has anyone been able to deal with it effectively with any vitamins/supplements? or any tips?", "Thalassemia induced anemia and pregnancy Hey all, so as the title says I have thalassemia induced anemia (not just right now...always) right now my hemoglobin is at 8g/dL which is normal for me but I have gotten it up to 9.5 range before and try to keep it there if possible. This being said I am pregnant with my second child and I feel so guilty about the fact that I just dont want to move or get out or bed. I thought maybe I was having pregnancy depression but I am wondering if it could be the thalassemia/anemia. Side note. I have beta thalassemia minor and have been aware of it for nearly 20 years. I am normally a very uppity and motivated person so this is very unlike me to feel so drained. I am taking folic acid. Anyone have any thoughts? Am I just a lazy terd right now? Lol (I am okay with hearing the truth). Anyone else ever felt absolutely disgusted with themselves for not wanting to do anything at all? It is been 4 days in the house now and I just cant seem to gather energy to get about. My hips and back hurt from the constant sitting and while my husband is very supportive and encourages relaxing I am freaking out! I am a type personality all the way and I am internally having the worst anxiety attacks because I feel riddled with guilt over this. How recent was your 8 level?  When I was pregnant my Hb dropped below 7 and I had to have transfusions.   I also had extreme tiredness during a molar pregnancy, but my Hb was fine then.  What about b vitamins like b6 and b12?  Are you on those, they can help with energy.  Wheatgrass also helps me. Just recently, maybe a week ago my levels were checked. I am severely vit d and b deficient to the point where I see a neurologist (take 50,000iu 2x week). However I have been on those since pre pregnancy so I am not sure if its helping with the energy. How did you feel? I feel like I could sleep all day and still be tired, is that at all similar to how you felt? I dont think you are lazy! Our bodies are going through a huge transition - even without factoring in the thal. I am a beta minor as well. With my first pregnancy, my hb dropped as low as 6.4. It stayed around 7 usually. Just remember - being pregnant is temporary. I am exhausted all the time this pregnancy, so I dont have much for advice there lol but just know that it isnt just you being a bum. It is hard work to grow a human.", "Why is Thalassemia Beta Minor a concern for pregnancy? Doctors told me I MUST get tested before planned pregnancy and immediately if unplanned but did not really want to bother me with details even after saying I wanted to know more. The most I was told is that I might need blood transfusions. I believe the concern is more for your child. If you _and_ your partner both have the thalassemia trait, there is a 1/4 chance of your child having the major version, which is a very serious disease (that requires constant blood transfusions).\n\ne.g. \n\nedit: should also clarify that you would be tested for the trait (beta thalassemia minor). Having the trait is virtually harmless, you will not require blood transfusions, the issue is having a child with someone who also has the trait. It can also have some bad complications if gestational anemia sets in. My mom apparently had a real bad time with my older brother, none of the doctors were familiar with thalassemia and could not figure out why her hemoglobin kept dropping. yup, this", "Does Thalassemia minor have symptoms? According to my doctor and parents, no, but researching online has told me conflicting things. I have always known I have had some blood trait disorder but was told it would not cause me in problem. Recently got blood work and discovered what I actually have from my doctor after she caught my mild anemia. She told it is not a problem and there are absolutely no symptoms.\n\nAll my life I have had what I would call being \u201ctired\u201d but I know realize is fatigue. I am very pale and have dark bags under my eyes always. Always had low appetite struggling with keeping weight. The amount of times my parents and others commented on me being lazy or pale growing up was annoying to say the least and if a genetic issue caused that I would feel som validation to say the least. \n\nMy question is if I have a mild anemia why would not I feel it? I think my parents do not understand cannot be cured does not mean no symptoms. I am not really a hypochondriac but now my family thinks I am, am I crazy?  Thalassemia minor does not in and of itself have symptoms unless you want to call anemia a symptom.  Maybe your anemia, according, to the doctor is mild, but you can still not tolerate said anemia well.  Have your iron stores checked. \n\nPersonally my symptoms come and go as my hemoglobin count lowers and raises. I am pale, fatigued, but I have little issues with appetite etd.\n\nThe important thing is not to become so sure that your fatigue and other symptoms are a result of thalassemia that you become complacent and miss out on other very serious conditions that cause similar symptoms.   I also have the thalassemia trait. My only symptom is, like you, mild anemia. I have bouts of fatigue, especially around my period. I eat chicken liver 1-2 times a week and it helps.\n\n", "Hemoglobin dropped from 11.3 to 9.2 in 3 months. Dr insists that I take iron I have Beta Thalassemia Trait and for the last few year 11.3 has been my normal hemo count, which is awesome as it used to linger around 9.7 to 10.3.\n\nI recently had a huge comprehensive blood test done to prep for surgey and things look super bad on paper. \n\nMy MCV is 53.4, MCH is 16.6, my Ferritin stores are 4.  Iron is 19 and Iron saturation is 5. Just three years ago my stores were completely normal. I have a few other health issues and well... I am loing blood somewhere.\n\nMy primary care doctor's answer is. Take iron. Feel like crap with TBT? Feel crappier taking iron. She says to give it 3 months.\n\nDoes Iron help anyone here at all???", "Am I thalassemia minor or intermedia? Sorry if this is not how I am supposed to go about finding out or if this information even gives a clue about whether I am minor or intermediate.

You might have the same, but a doctor will be able to tell you.\n\nThe shortness of breath was the tip-off for me. I have been an athlete my entire life, but could never do anything that lasted longer than 2 minutes or so. It is the main reason I got into weightlifting and martial arts as my fitness hobbies. You can take as much time as you like when you are lifting weights, and martial arts matches rarely last more than a minute. (Eventually some of my opponents figured out that they could just wait me out until I was about to collapse from hypoxia, but that is another story). I could never handle running more than a kilometre or so without splatting on the trail. \n\nAnother important thing is to tell your primary care doctor that you have thal. All of your blood tests will show that you are anemic and they will recommend iron supplements, but that is actually really dangerous. Our disease makes it impossible for our bodies to process too much iron, and iron toxicity can be deadly. Just keep a healthy diet with lots of greens, and you will learn to get through it. I am glad so many others are into weightlifting. I am super into powerlifting, which requires more short bursts of energy rather than long term endurance. But I still do hypertrophic work that requires a lot of oxygen intake and I find it hard to workout sometimes :/\nThanks for the response! I believe I have minor as well because I have been okay most of my life and it has not really affected me too bad when it comes to running. Do you have any tips for increasing endurance? Alpha or Beta? Beta thalassemia minor is \"rarely symptomatic\". I was first diagnosed with it when i was a kid and apart from an enlarged spleen, a somewhat lower red cell blood count and somewhat in excess iron, I have never had any symptoms, I did sports all my life, including endurance ones and am currently a very avid rock climbing practitioner. \n\n\"Alpha thalassemia intermedia, or hemoglobin H disease, causes hemolytic anemia.\" \n\n\"Beta thalassemia intermedia is less severe than beta thalassemia major and may require episodic blood transfusions\" \n\nSource: (\n\nhemolytic anemia, means basically red blood cells being destroyed faster than your body can produce them, so you would need to do something about it at some point: (\n\nSo unless it causes hemolytic anemia and being treated as such or need transfusions, doctors would probably not put you in the intermedia group (for either alpha or beta). But in the end, why does it matter what you call it? Some \"greens\" have iron in excess so not really all \"greens\". Spinach, broccoli to name a couple have a lot of iron, you should really avoid those. Alos lettuce, I would argue. I love lettuce salad, but because i ate too much of it it is the only thing that gave me some issues with my spleen when i was younger, especially in spring. I still eat lettuce, but try not to eat it too often. Does not look like intermedia. Pls consult your doctor though.", "Thalassemia and sun sensitivity I was wondering if anyone out there with thalassemia minor has developed an allergy to uv and sunlight? I have been diagnosed with solar urticaria and a porphyria syndrome, but we do not know the cause.

I have had regular blood transfusions all my life right from when I was six months old and Thal was first detected and simultaneously, since age 2, I have been on iron chelation therapy. For the first 23 years, I had to take intravenous Desferal injection and then I switched to Asunra. For the last five years, I have been on fluctuating dosage of Asunra tablets, anywhere between 800 mg a day to 2400 mg, daily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last few months were specifically rough. On physical health front, I have had mornings where I felt like a sinking feeling and my family blamed it on my Intermittent Fasting (which I have been on for 3 years now and dropped 20 kilos weight gradually). It is never been a deterrent in any way and honestly, I was not able to make head or tail of the situation, until my recent transfusion when I got my serrum ferritin done. The reports were lower than they would ever been in 28 long years \u2014171! \n\nNow, my doc has put me off Asunra (iron chelation) for the next three months and wants me to repeat the test. In India, growing up, a ferritin value of &lt;1000 was considered good. Over the years with the advancement in medicine and research, the value of &lt;500 was considered safe and stable.

I have beta thal major and my oxygen lvl usually ranges from 98-99 The variation you see on that graph cannot be caused by thalassemia, otherwise it would be constantly low. Spo2 sensors are not acurate due to many factors like arm position, sweat on the skin, etc.  Or more unlikely it could be sleep apnea and it will not do you any harm to check that out with your doctor. i only spot-check during the day but run 96% - 97% Beta thal minor, usually at 96-99.

So you would think if anyone would want someone like this, it would be someone who will always produce carriers of a terrible disease they experience everyday. No one wants to date based on an invisible phenotype. If two people fall in love and it is a concern, genetic counseling is available and those who already know they are carriers, have sex knowing that.

If yes what did you do about it? Mine was enlarged which was confirmed by ultrasound but it went away on its own. It is not uncommon though to be put on steroids  to keep inflammation down or to have your spleen removed. I was born with an enlarged spleen. My doctors monitor it to makes sure it does not become too big. If it does become too big, they will have to remove it. It is stayed the same size all my life though. It is about 5 cm below my ribs Many thal warriors develop an enlarged spleen (not me though), mostly after the ultrasound if it is seen to be beyond manageable then the doctor performs a splenectomy and you do not need to worry about it as you will not face any trouble die to this procedure later on in your life so be brave. It is not big enough yet to consider surgery. Though it has grown over the past few years, mostly because of infrequent transfusions. I have been trying to maintain my hemoglobin above 10 for the past several months and now it is shrinking and probably would go back to normal in some more time. Just wanted to know what are the options and how safe they are if by chance the surgery becomes a necessity. Definitely have to talk to my doc regarding the situation post the surgery.

Where I live AstraZeneca is readily available, pfizer you have to be considered a priority, which I am not considered as such right now. (And wont be for weeks) Considering thalassemia minor does have an increased risk of blood clots (and I get fatigue symptoms) and the AstraZeneca vaccine does have a rare chance of blood clots should I not get it and get pfizer instead? I could literally go get AZ right this instant, but when I can get pfizer is unknown. \n\nHas anyone here had the AZ vaccine? \nHas anyone here been told they should not get the AZ vaccine, by a health professional? \n\nSomeone elsewhere has suggested to me to take aspirin before and after the vaccine to help thin the blood, could this be recommended? Thalassemia is naturally thinner blood. We are more prone to not clotting when we need to. Yup, exactly this. I have not personally had a doctor tell me that with thalassemia I was more at risk for blood clots. If AZ is all you can get right now it is better than nothing. The blood clotting with AZ happened in a very minute portion of the population, so unless you have another condition on top of thalassemia that causes you to clot more, and a doctor has told you that AZ is fine, then I would do the AZ I still ended up clotting in my leg after an injury lol. This is not necessarily true, depending on the type you have and other factors. \n Speak to your doctor not us randoms on Reddit I have trouble clotting after blood tests. I can bleed for hours after blood is taken. i personally have thalassemia major and got the AstraZeneca vaccine back in March and have had no issues but obviously up to you, that is just my experience"]
