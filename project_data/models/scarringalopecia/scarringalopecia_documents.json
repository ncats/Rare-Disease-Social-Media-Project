["Folliculitis Decalvans treatment with Humira Below is a new free PubMed white paper on the successful treatment of Folliculitis Decalvans with Humira after the patient failed the traditional methods. It seems researchers are using biologics more frequently now for therapy-resistant patients. Has anyone here tried it?\n\n I would be interested in any feedback on this too ! My dermatologist suggested this to me as well after we tried all the other usual treatments.  I decided against it after researching price and possible side effects but luckily my FD has somewhat subsided in intensity and I kind of just accepted it as is. I would also be very interested in any feedback. Interested in following this. Are you currently on medicine to control your FD? I am currently on Keflex and considering Tacrolimus but have had success in the past with Rifampin/Clindamycin and Accutane for my FD. I am entertaining the idea of just accepting it as it is probably 5/10 active now but it is still frustrating. No I stopped taking medication after my second round of Accutane back around 2018 I believe.  I would probably say I am 5/10 right now as well.  My scalp is not painful to touch anymore and it is no longer throbbing with intensity which was the worst part for me. Good luck man.", "scarring alopecia - how to apply ointment just joined as i have recently been diagnosed with scarring alopecia - i am getting the steroid injections once a month and am supposed to apply ointment to my scalp - i am having a difficult time doing this as the area that i need to apply still has a good amount of very long hair.  Any tips for successfully applying ointment to a relatively full head of hair? Just got to do it, spread your hair as best you can so you can get to the roots and hopefully the upper portion of the hairs will cover up excess stickiness", "Bluish blotches with Folliculitis Decalvans  I am curious to see who all here has blue spots. I know I do not. negative for me as well. Not that I know of... negative here I have never had blue spots", "FOLLICULITIS DECALVANS A 14 YEAR PROGRESSION Hi Everyone!!\n\n   I have folliculitis decalvans. I knew I had CCCA for about 7 years now but it was just last week after some scalp irritations and some internet research did I realize I have folliculitis decalvans. Emotionally, it is an odd feeling because tbh I have never taken great care of my hair (no doubt a big reason of how I got where I am), growing up my hair strands and hair density was so thick as a young girl I actually prayed to God for LESS HAIR!! (LOL He said \"your wish is my command!\") , and I felt as though my condition was 100% my fault. In the past, I was a heavy drinker and heavy smoker (cigarettes) light smoker (marijuana) so I was convinced that my lifestyle was the reason for my illness and that I had developed some autoimmune disorder or hard to diagnose cancer. My biggest concern was that my condition was fatal. I kept going to doctors and they kept telling me nothing was wrong with me. THIS was what angered me and depressed me. I felt like I was slowly dying and no one cared enough to help me, doctors especially. Last week, upon realizing I had FD, it was as if a weight was finally lifted off of my shoulders. I FINALLY HAD AN ANSWER. Previously, the only treatments I had tried were minoxidil, but that only increased hair fall and I went to a dermatologist who seemed to be more interested in hawking her sponsored hair shampoos than actually helping  me. Back then my hair was not as bad as it is right now but the bald spots were significant. Please recall I said my hair strands are thick!! thicker than thread so when I went to this dermatologist in NYC after dealing with hair loss for 10 years and her response was flippant (ITS NOT THAT BAD) I was immediately vexed and confused. I wondered, \"Oh so should I come back when I look like Homer simpson?!\" She was not alone. Most doctors seemed for me to want to be grateful that I wasnt as bad as their other patients but what they did not know is, at the time of their viewing of my hair I had already lost 75% of it. Although I could comb over and hide it, that seemed nothing to be grateful for. Psychologically it was the uncaring that broke  me, not the actual hair loss. As a result, I just stopped going to doctors. I cut out alcohol, smoked significantly less but didnt quit because i had been told my condition was permanent so I was like \"let me have at least some simple pleasures\". Now I know I have FD, I made 2 appointments, one with a hack in India whose \"treatment\" is to put 2 strands of hair in a vial of solution in india and then magically the good vibrations from that vial in india was supposed to travel on airwaves to get to me in NY and cure my condition....I actually paid $50 for him to tell me that nonsense. All I can say is, he is lucky he is in india or I mightve slapped him in his head. After being exposed to his bs, I immediately felt horrible because I knew that while this has not affected me as much as other people psychologically, I know how much society values beauty and long thick beautiful locks and how that makes some desperate to achieve this standard of beauty, enough to fund \\*ssholes like this \"doctor\". I have NEVER been the type to take advantage of a person who is down and out in fact if you want to push me into meaningful action, attacking me as an individual would not illicit a response so strongly as when I realize you are targeting an entire group who needs help and not lies/abuse. So once I saw how limited the information available was on the internet, how many hacks are out there (both real licensed doctors and fake ones), and the amount of people suffering, I felt like I must do something. My hope in writing this post is that we as a community find a solution through commonalities, anecdotal, scientific evidences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease read my origin story below and please let me know if any of your history is similar.\n\nI have sickle cell trait. In my childhood I had anemia. Growing up,  my sister would braid my hair super tight because she \"didnt want to have to do it again in a week\". \n\nMy mom would grease my scalp with this brand called African Pride (I cant remember with what frequency) back then my hair was abominably thick. I do not know if it was a result of this hair product and her consistent application to my scalp or if my hair was always meant to be that dense. \n\nWhen my sister was around the age to go off to college my mom started relaxing my hair because she did not know how to do it herself. I did not care for my hair (i was around 10 or 11 yo then, barely knew how to care for myself with any consistency and tbh still a struggle)  so my hair started to fall out and they cut the relaxer out of my hair and I wore braids for quite some time.\n\n I wanted to look like the girls I saw on tv so I begged my mom to start relaxing my hair again, promising I would do better. The next time my hair fell out, it was after buying a hard thick cotton bandana (I did not understand about traction alopecia) and wrapping my hair with it at nights. It eventually took out the back half of my hair. We went back to protective chemical free styling and eventually it grew back. \n\nSkip forward about 4/5 years, I went abroad to Asia where there was no one for miles and COUNTRIES that could do my hair. At that time I would gone back to using chemical straightener. My friend suggested microlink hair extensions for length (not sure of where the hair came from or the brand and the salon where I got it done is now closed)  and I jumped at the chance for quick length. Then I, AGAIN, proceeded to treat my hair like crap with foreign hairs tugging at my scalp. I would wash it, leave it wet and go out and other dumb behaviors like that. When it was time to take out the microlinks, it made one tiny bald spot which was a big deal for me at the time but i was convinced, like all the other times, it would grow back. I got braids again. \n\nI was 18 at the time and headed off to college, where delicious healthy food options were out of the question (I survived on grilled cheeses, soups, and sugar beverages because it was the only  things were consistently edible. I almost never drank water). I drank alcohol like prohibition was a looming threat and picked up smoking A LOT of smoking. So eating like crap, drinking like crap, living like crap (not getting much sleep, not working out). The bald spot i noticed was not growing back....this time it was getting bigger and bigger. Ashamed and trying to avoid how expensive hair care was in my college town, I would started to relax my hair myself. Years went by I kept up what I would been doing in college and that bald spot just grew and grew and grew. \n\nI went back abroad and doubled down. I was relaxing my own hair and using clip in extensions to cover my thinning hair. That Is when the spots increased. I tried using minoxidil but my hair just fell out faster. I didnt stick with it for more than two months.   \n\n\nIt wasnt until maybe 5 years ago, I let it hit home that you get out what you put in. So I stopped relaxing my hair and changed my diet. Stopped drinking alcohol all together, smoked about 5 cigarettes a week and smoked marijuana maybe 3 small joints a week, drank a gallon of water a day, started cooking healthier organic meals for myself and did my best to eat red meat at least once a week for the iron and ate dark leafy green vegetables daily. My hair did not grow back. Before that I had always thought once I eat right and take care of myself my hair would grow back but the damage had been done. That was also around the time I started to get \"pimples\" on my scalp which was peculiar because I had maybe 5 pimples on my face in my whole life. The scalp pimple were rare though. Since the first one theyve come in with more frequency but still pretty rare and theyre always the size as pictured. I would say at first Id get a bump once every 2 years, Id pop it and then more bald spots would ensue. Then in the last year Ive had 5 small pimples. Since the microlink extensions, all my hair ever did was fall out. I tried black castor oil and would sleep with a plastic cap on my head thinking it would help my EXTREMELY dry and brittle hair but my hair would be soft for about a half day, then go right back to being dry and brittle. All my approaches have been holistic because i never felt comfortable using chemicals and steroids for a condition I would been told repeatedly was permanent. That brings us to today. Last week I had 2 pimples in one week (2 out of this years 5). I got frustrated and just shave all my hair off. That Is when I realized the tufting at the root of my hair. That Is when I realized I had folliculitis decalvans. It has never been as severe as reddit user imthejason but the tiny bumps and the tufting is what makes me believe I have the condition. I met with the fugazi indian doctor already and also set an appointment with a real dermatologist who specializes in FD for 2/22/2021 in order to confirm my suspicions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease share as much of your hair story as possible. I am looking for common threads. I know I treated my hair and body like garbage but the confusing part is that I had friends right along side of me who partied harder, did harder drugs and still keep up the college binge lifestyle and they all have their hair. After seeing how lacefront wigs took off and thanks to instagram, I see that a great many people are suffering in silence and shame. It made me wonder about just how many people are dealing with this?! They are from all races, genders, and locations...I thought all these people couldnt have been party animals, I know for sure white dude Bob wasnt getting his hair chemically straightened and braided so just wtf is going on?! \n\nIf any one responds to this thread as I previously requested please share as much of your hair story as possible. Do you have any preexisting conditions like my sickle cell trait? Do you smoke? Do you exercise religiously? Have you any deficiencies revealed through blood work? \n\nIf its effecting so many people can we start a baseline? I know most people wash their hair in the shower. Are you using hot or cold to wash your hair? Would you be open to sending me water samples from whatever water source you wash your hair from? I would be willing to pay for shipping of the vials and the testing. Ive blamed myself for all of this condition but I cant help thinking that theres also some external factor that we are all missing so I would like to start with what we all have access to without a doubt; water. If youve read this far, thank you for taking the time. I would implore you not to give up like I have done countless times before. This is effecting way too many people to be ignored or taken lightly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you again and have the Happiest Valentines Day!!!! Thanks for sharing! Tip: look up Grant Genereux and his vitamin A detox for auto-immune disorders. That Is is the path I am on now. I have not found any other help &gt; Grant Genereux and his vitamin A\n\nThanks so much for your suggestion. i will read more about it but I started this thread more to hear about hair histories and lifestyles not looking for suggestions really. Im trying to find a common thread, if there is any through people's stories. Please share yours if you have one. Im currently drinking close to a gallon of water everyday and Ive been taking vitafusions womens multivitamins. I just ordered\n1) Active B Complex 60 vcaps By Integrative Therapeutics\n2) Nutrilite Multi Carotene Dietary Supplement\n3) NOW Foods Vitamin D3 Highest Potency 10000 IU \n4) Omega 3 Fish Oil - Omega 3 Supplement with Essential Fatty Acid Combination of EPA &amp; DHA, Triple Strength Wild Fish Oil softgels \n\nIf I see any changes I will be sure to create another thread to go over the result after Ive finished 90 capsules of each Ok, I thought you wanted to find some solution to your problem. I have gotten some promising results from hair loss through diet, so I would go down that route. People have so many different hair stories, I think it will be hard to deduce a path forward from that, since doctors basically have no idea what causes scarring alopecia, but I wish you the best of luck :) I will never touch a multivitamine, especially vitamine A and carotenes, nor omega 3 fish oils for the rest of my life. These are all vitamin A bombs, and will make our auto-immune issues worse. I really hope you will not take any of these, I know it might be hard to trust me, but please read Grant Genereux\u2019s books that are free on his website. You will not pay a dime, and might maybe get hair back! what kind of alopecia do you have? do/did you drink, smoke? do you exercise? this kind of information will be helpful. people do have so many different hair stories but its necessary to hear them before I can assume what worked for you will work for me esp because people also have so many different types of alopecias and preexisting conditions. Diagnosed with FD, much exercise, no smoking, moderate drinking before diagnosis, no drinking now. Tried to take matters into my own hands after being on all kinds of Immunosuppressive drugs that just f\u2019s you up in the long run. Tried a lot of diets, vegan, paleo etc, nothing worked, until i tried the zero vitamin A diet, and have gotten some improvement thank you for sharing!! Welcome to the subreddit! I have had Folliculitis Decalvans since ~2008. I am currently not on any medicine and my scalp inflammation is about a 3 or 4 out of 10 with very little pustular activity. My hope is the disease is slowly burning out after so many different treatments and being active for so long. Isotretinoin likely had the biggest impact in permanently moderating the disease but I cannot be sure. I am looking into diet options as well as topical shampoos/ointments, mainly because it is manageable right now but also because I have tried just about every oral medication.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n-\tnot a smoker\n-\tI drink alcohol 2-3 times a month in moderation \n-\trelatively decent shape and exercise a couple of times per week\n-\twarm showers\n-\tI take Men\u2019s One a Day multivitamin and Claritin every day\n-\tno deficiencies from bloodwork, even Vitamin D which plays a role in immune response \n-\talternate between Nizoral and Head and Shoulders shampoo (for now, I experiment with shampoo frequently)\n\nI also thought water could play a role, but since I have had this condition I have moved several times, including 6 months in another country, and it did not cause a material change in inflammation. That does not rule out shower water as a potential factor, but wanted to mention it. I am looking into gluten and dairy free diets now as well as the role gut health plays in inflammation, but I think we all know that is a rabbit hole and in the early stages of scientific substantiation.\n\nI like the idea of finding common threads for those of us with scarring alopecia, thanks for posting! Thank you so much for your input!!! Only if you feel comfortable, would you mind telling me which town you were in when FD started? also If youve ever maintained the same hair &amp; health routines from location to location and found that your condition got worse/better, which town were you in? I ask because I started to do research in my own local water sources  and old analyses found higher than acceptable levels of  \ndioxane=hair loss, arsenic=hair loss, chromium=hair loss, nitrate and nitrates these are more complex as related to hair bc nitrates have been rumored to make hair grow and regulates the hair follicle activity but I cant find any research about what happens to hair when youre exposed to too much (get ready for speculation.... but perhaps this is where the tufting comes in???), perchlorate=hair loss, Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) AKA manmade TEFLON=hair loss and radium=hair loss \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; \nradium \n\n\nwhile this last article makes clear it cant be absorbed, if its in the drinking water its impossible to not get inside your system. We wash vegetables, cook rice, etc. and radium in high concentrations to the point of poisoning can result in hair loss at the first stages. \n\nOf course I will have to speak to my chemist/doctor friends about how these toxins may react to different different blood types but with my initial research it appears that different blood types can be more or less effected depending on the type. \n\nMy experience with relocation, I was in Hawaii for like 2 weeks and after washing, my hair felt more luxurious, moisturized and healthy than it has been in quite some time....that is when I REALLY started to wonder about the water ive been exposed to. also thank you for the welcome!! Im glad I found you!! My scalp inflammation is down to a zero now through diet change and zero vitamin A/carotenes.\nAlso, I would never advice anybody to take isotretinoin, this is one of the worst poisons you can take. It is basically a synthetic vitamin A, and it totally destroys your stem cells and sebaceous glands. That drug ruined my life because of the side effects that I am trying to deal with now. Sure, inflammation went down for some months, but came back with a vengeance. Remindme! 24 hours There is a 2 hour delay fetching comments.\n\nI will be messaging you in 1 day on ( to remind you of (\n\n( to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) (\n\n*****\n\n|(\n|-|-|-|-| Has the vitamin A detox been working for you? In terms of scalp inflammation, yes indeed, a lot! I have basically zero scalp inflammation now. But I have other issues as well, mainly side effects from isotretinoin/Accutane which a derm prescribed me for my scalp inflammation/FD. But this diet takes time, detoxing vitamin A from the liver is a long process I recently received biopsy results saying I have early signs of LPP. My hair loss started two years ago after a course of accurate. \n\nMy scalp sometimes hurts but I never thought it was scarring alopecia. My hair loss is diffuse but I am afraid it will get worse. Do you have any recommendations? I am on doxycycline and a topical steroid. I am not a medical doctor, but I think all these auto-immune diseases for which they have no \u00abcure\u00bb, e.g. scarring alopecia, rosacea, psoriasis, are just symptoms of super complex  underlying biological causes which we do not understand, so instead we treat the symptoms with poisons like isotretinoin and immunosuppressants, alongside antibiotics. I mean, it should be the first sign that the dermatologists have no idea what they are doing when they give us these drugs. It is horrible. \n\nPersonally I am taking a chance going down this no vitamin A route, I do not know for sure if vitamin A is the culprit here, but is sure seems like it since my problems started after Accutane/isotretinoin - which is basically massive doses of vitamin A.\n\nI am sorry for your pain, and it is hard for me to give advice, I can just tell my story &lt;3 I appreciate the reply. It is horrible unfortunately but I am willing to try the no vitamin A diet. I have been putting it off because I cannot imagine accutane still being in my system after so long. But I have no other option. Thanks again for the help Totally feel you! I would make an account on the forum of Grant Genereux, tell your story in the Accutane section, and ask that question, why it is still in our bodies. It has been discussed there several times, but I am sure you will get an answer. If you have no history of a high vitamin A diet, such as prolonged periods of eating vitamin A supplements, cod liver oil, organ meats, sweet potatoes, spinach, mangos and other \u00abhealthy\u00bb vitamin A bombs, maybe your issue is something else, and I think you will get good feedback there. Thank you for the advice. I will definitely check it out. I am so tired of coming across years old threads of the same accutane induced hair loss. Would be helpful to go to an established forum Do not I know it! There are some super smart users there, talking about the relationship between hypervitaminosis A and hairloss. Heads up that this is a long battle if you go down this path! Hi there! Sorry to hear about your sus experience with an Indian doctor - they abound unfortunately, especially as \u2018trichology\u2019 is a booming business here! I am Indian, and am probably the only person in the country with this particular condition! \nIt started to manifest when I was 18- and did a real number on my self confidence. At the time no one could diagnose it, and about 50 percent of my hair fell out. It was only when I moved to the US that I took a scalp biopsy that gave me the tufted folliculitis diagnosis- and the news that it was not reversible. \nI have been on various medications but isotretinoin has been the most effective at keeping the pimples and pustules at bay.. since the hair loss is very visible I have recently been using semi-permanent hair systems (glue attached hair pieces) but it is not without its inflammatory effects - oh well! \nI had tried various diets in the beginning stages in hopes of reversing/\u2018curing\u2019 the condition - veganism, raw veganism, but the reality is that since there is no known cause of this, there is no real solution. In terms of nutrition, it is hard to believe that that could be a real factor - call me cynical. \nHope you are doing better- anyone else out there want to share their experience and tips?", "Clascoterone Has anyone been tracking this drug for potential use in scarring alopecia?

I suffered from serious dermatitis for about a year and now 90% of scale is gone. I was also suffering with folliculitis for about 5 months. I lost a lot of hair during this time and probably will not see it come back. It has been two years now, my scalp is still red in a lot of areas but my skin is mostly clear. I took doxycycline and it seemed to get rid of my infection and made my scalp feel better. Otherwise I could not sleep with the back of my scalp touching my pillow. \n\nI decided to get back on doxycycline for two months so maybe the remaining redness goes away. The first time I only had twenty days worth and in that time it made a big difference. \n\nWhat treatments do you guys use for this type of hair loss? How do you guys cycle antibiotics? I know of antibiotics(I do not know names), immunomodulators (I probably should not use/do not know names), I guess there are also corticosteroids. Is there anything else medicinal or potent, natural, and anti inflammatory? Have you tried an anti-inflammatory diet? No dairy, gluten, sugar, refined carbs, msg, trans fats, saturated fats. \n\nI notice my scalp improves when I limit my gluten. Agree with this! I am taking some (very expensive) hair vitamins and they let you do consults with their doctors. The one I am seeing is a naturopathic doctor and suggested gluten free. She also suggested customizing my diet based on blood type. \n\nAlso, I do not know if this is what you are asking but I am using clobetasol on my scalp. Thanks for responding I did not think anyone would. I tried the keto diet for a month and lost a lot of weight. I am a skinnier guy so it is hard for me to get away with dieting. I had dermatitis then so I do not know if it made any difference. Are you in the United States? I would like to use clobetasol but it is really expensive. I was up late last night googling steroid potency charts. It looks like dermasmoothe is affordable but is it strong enough. I am in the United States. \n\nI have never heard of Dermasmooth but I just Googled it. It seems it is just fluocinonide?\n\nI was prescribed fluocinonide by the first dermatologist I went to and it seemed to help. My new dermatologist said clobetasol is a little stronger so switched me to that.\n\nEdit: So I said that to say it might be worth trying Dermasmooth. Also, my scalp was really red when I started the fluocinonide. Like it looked really terrible. I think that is what cleared it up though. Were you losing hair from your inflammation? Did you lose a lot? Did anything grow back? My hair looks completely destroyed. I am using minoxidil and am wondering if a strong anti inflammatory regimen will pay off. I am also suppressing dht. Yes, I have lost a good amount. It is growing back a little but I am not sure if it will grow completely back. I have only been on treatment for about 4 months so time will tell. My dermatologist said it should grow back but I do not know how she can say that since I have not had a biopsy to see if the follicles scarred. Have you had a scalp biopsy? \n\nI will honestly be happy to just keep it from getting worse. Mine looks just like your photos. Is your hair loss all over? I think a strong anti-inflammatory regime will pay off, it is at least worth a shot. Are you working with a dermatologist? I had a biopsy but they said there was no scarring or inflammation. It does not make any sense because there was redness, itching, stinging/burning in a lot of places. I really think the biopsy was not accurate. My hair loss is all over. \n\nDid you catch yours right away or did it take you awhile to start using corticosteroids consistently?\n\nDo you mean that our skin issue looks similar?", "Does this look like scarring alopecia on the hairline? I am asking because I am getting a burning sensation on my scalp every time I move my hair  I have been on minoxidil for 6 months now. You can see the baby hairs on the pics. They would not be there if I had scarring alopecia right? I do not think so! If it was scarring the skin would appear shiny where the hair was lost and you would not be able to see any follicle openings or baby hairs. Scalp sensations are common with non scarring hair loss as well such as telogen effluvium. If your really worried go to a dermatologist who can diagnose you properly", "People who had a biopsy, how big is the bald spot? How many parts of your scalp did they take? I thought it would be just one small 0.5mm part of your scalp when I was going to have one but got afraid as they said they would take multiple which I did not want. But I am starting to think my issue is not just seb derm or folliculitis and its most likley FD and wish I had the biopsy months ago at least for answers. I do not remember how big it was but they only removed one. That is exactly what I thought would happen like I did not see why they said more then one.

Ive been on Roacutanne and hope that will help.\n\nBut I have visited many Doctors and some said that hair transplantation was possible some said that I will have to surgically cut this lumps out and get my scapulas stitched together\n\nWondering if anyone had any experience with one of these, is it actually possible to do hair transplantation? after you get scarring alopecia, your skin in that area is dead right? Well, my understanding of scarring alopecia is that your skin is not dead; what is dead is the hair follicles - so you cannot grow any hair again in those areas.  The scarring is as a result of the dead follicles scarring over.\n\nYou should definitely check with doctors who actually do the two different procedures, whether transplantation or the stitching together.  In my case, frontal fibrosing alopecia,  the doctor told me that I have to wait five years to be sure the fibrosing (scarring) was not still active.  I have not checked into surgically pulling the scalp forward (sort of like a reverse face lift) to cover the hair loss area but will at my next dermatology appointment.  The major problem with either of these procedures, however, is that they are not covered by insurance and hence are terribly expensive. so with the dead follicles , it is possible that with hair transplantation it would work just fine? I had a couple corrective surgeries where they tried to cut out the dead areas and stitch the healthy edges together. These...well, it did get rid of some of the bald areas, but not most of it. The scalp has some give, but not a lot, so they could not cut out very much at one time. My scarring was very extensive. \n\nTwo years after these surgeries, I tried a hair transplant. That, to me, was much more worth the money. Most of the hairs took root and continue to live. Even though it was not enough to completely fill in the bald areas, it made a big enough difference that they were less noticeable. If money is a concern, from my experience I would recommend the transplant, I would consider it the most successful of my procedures and cost less than the surgeries. But your doctor/dermatologist should be able to tell you which would have a better outcome for you specifically. That is good to hear that is an option. Did you have to wait for the disease to be in remission for a long time before getting the transplant? What form of scarring alopecia did you have?\nThanks", "Derms have said folliculitis before they have said seb derm. But I am scared it may be FD, I do understand this is not a server where I can be diagnosed but could someone maybe give me any advice   I am so bad at looking at pictures of FD. The only way to diagnose it is with a biopsy. My advice is to get a biopsy done first. Then get on medication if it is FD. For now, try to stay calm and keep busy until you do get it biopsied. Biopsy is the way, especially if you are getting pustules or boils on you are scalp Yeah I will have to wait. I did have the chance months ago but they wanted to do more then one and I was under the impression it was going to just be one small one and also at the time I thought it would not be necessary but now I have began to think more about it and FD sounds such like a possibility. Do you have any pics of yours you could share please? Update on treatments that help would be appreciated I have not had any luck yet. I am unsure to if I have normal folliculitis or not. I do not know if normal folliculitis does cause shedding or not. I may have a biopsy but am afraid as they want to do 2 which is just annoying You do not have folliculitis decalvans (FD) based on these photos. Yeah it is been 4-5 months since these photos I am still having these issues. But I am not sure what it is I have tried oral antifungals and recently my doc prescribed oral antibiotics which feel like hardly do anything or they do a little 100mg of doxy for 3 weeks. So I am not sure All these months on and my scalp is pretty much still like this. I lose about 7-14 strands every day brushing and 2-3 on pillow. If I scratch something in my sleep then it is a lot more. I was my hair 2 times a week. Monday and then Thursday so 3 days apart. Lose about 20-35 all together like washing and drying. I have tired antifungals and antibiotics and antifungal shampoos, the shampoos have caused thinning if anything. I have been suspecting a possible cancer possibly as it could be due to a failing immune system If this is all you are losing you have nothing to worry about. I am losing way more unfortunately.", "Lichen Planopilaris Hi guys! Quick question does anyone have lichen planopilaris but it is diffused around the scalp instead of it being concentrated on one spot on the scalp? I am 21 (M) and I have had lichen planopilaris for about 3 years now and even though my hair loss has been minimal it has thinned mainly in the crown area of the scalp and around my hairline. I do not have large spaces without hair but I do have small spaces and a lot of my follicles only have one hair growing from it instead of 2-3. Not diagnosed with this on the scalp. But I am diagnosed orally and have exactly what your describing. Mine is more diffuse rather than in one spot, however there are more bumps around the crown area and the back. I also do not have any major bald patches but when I have taken photos with the flash on of my scalp there are lots of small areas that I think are trying to meet up with one another and eventually form big patches.\nMy hair also snaps, I do not know if you would have or notice this being a guy but Im a female and have long hair but quite a few bits stick up as their somehow only a few inches long compared to the rest of it being down my back. Confusing really I am not 100 percent sure if it is snapping off or new bits growing but I am really guessing snapping\nI am glad you posted this though as most websites say about it being in one spot and I also definitely have it all over and some parts that are missing hair etc are not even red or do not have any bumps Type in \"lichen planopilaris donovan medical\" and he has a lot of helpful blogs and articles on the disease, which you will find helpful to answer your question here. He is probably one of the more prominent docs researching this rare disease (not a ton of folks are researching it). What treatment are you currently on for your lpp? I would see a derm and look to get aggressive with treating it so that you can stop further loss and stop the disease. Hi \n\nI had this back in 2017 and have several patch on my head. Hair does not grow any more.\n\nI went to a clinic and was given hydroxychloroquine for 6 months.

Are not the baby hairs indicative of no scarring present?", "Diagnosed with early signs of LPP Hello all, I am a bit depressed... I have been diffusely thinning on the scalp after I took a 6 month course of accutane. It is been two years since I noticed the thinning. It has gotten slightly better and when I used minoxidil for a year it almost seemed like I was recovering. \n\nBut I started shedding again and my hair had started getting worse, I had quit minoxidil a few months earlier because I felt like I hit a plateau of regrowth. So a month or so ago I had a biopsy taken. And I had some microscope pics taken too. The diagnosis turned out to be some signs of Lichen Planopilaris or LPP. But I am wondering how that is possible when I have been thinning for two years... would not I have scar tissue by now? According to a trichologist I have no scar tissue but I have a lot of inflammation. Here are the pics and my diagnosis. \n\n\n\nI have been on doxycycline and mometasone furoate (topical steroid) for around a month now. Have not noticed much of a difference. Allegra seems to help with some of the scalp pain. I just want regrowth at this point. I am optimistic because I do not have scarring but I just do not know how to get rid of the inflammation. Maybe I should change my diet? \n\nI would appreciate any advice, and please feel free to take a look at the pictures and my diagnosis. I have been thinking about going to Doctor Donovan about a consultation. Maybe it is actually androgenic alopecia rather than LPP since I heard biopsies can mistake them First off define what lpp is. Second youre going to shed no matter what if you stop minoxidil which is why i dont use it. Lichen Planopilaris, sorry about that. I will edit my post to clarify it. And yeah I figured it was the minoxidil shed but it just means that my hair has not improved on its own but rather from the minoxidil gains Youre defining what minoxidil does. Minoxidil doesnt repair your scalp or your hair it just temporarily increases hair growth potentially. From my research theres no known reason as to how it does other than hyperpolarizing cell membranes. From my knowledge of science regardless of its effect its not natural and knowning what we know it is only temporary which is why you have to use it forever. Which is also the reason i dont use it. Its a chemical that for reason causes growth. Given my quick google search its apparently a genetic disease but id recommend trying some natural remedies to aid your scalp health. Worst case scenario it wouldnt hurt you. Also using minoxidil does dry out your scalp.\n\nAs for diagnosis you really shouldnt be asking people on reddit. Misdiagnosis can happen with anything but that is highly variable on the condition what is being tested the methodology and knowledge of the subject at hand. Only actual MDs DOs PhDs can give you an actual factual answer on that. I appreciate the response. Yeah Minoxidil is a bitch. It helps but it is facade really. I have even heard oral minoxidil can double your hair density but it dangerous.\n\nThe reason why I came to Reddit with this is that it is more accessible than a doctor. If I have a question I got to wait until my doctor is available and even then she is going to recommend me first line treatments. I want actual advice from people with similar experiences. Maybe they have run into similar obstacles as me and have the experience to guide me. I get it just keep in mind youre asking about a rare autoimmune disorder. For mph know there is finasteride topical and oral as well as lllt which seems.promising About the inflammation...there is the inflammation diet where you cut out gluten and milk and other foods. I limit my gluten and that helps my inflammation a bit. I am not very familiar with LPP as I have folliculitis decalvans. To really get my inflammation under control I take humira. Yeah I am thinking of cutting out carbs and going for a low inflammation diet I have the same dx.  I was initially told after a biopsy 5 yrs ago that my hair loss was due to LPP.  I was in denial and found another derm who did another biopsy 1 year ago and the results were scaring alopecia which the derm said happens with LPP as it progresses.  \n\nI have not found anything that calms the inflammation or increases hairgrowth/decreases loss.  I tried minoxidil for over a year with no result other than an extremely angry scalp. When I stopped I never had massive shedding.  \n\nRight before covid started I was in the process of getting evaluated to try some oral med to help hair growth.  I cannot remember the name of it but it required monthly blood tests to make sure it was not damaging my liver or kidneys (cannot remember which).  \n\nI am hopeful someone else has positive advice that they are willing to share.

Feels good to read other peoples stories.\n", "Confused about extent of follicle loss - honest help appreciated (I think I doomed anyway!) Hello everyone,\n\nI am a 28 year old man who has lost a lot of frontal hair the last few years to sebbhorrmeic dermatitis, and me scratching my forehead consistently over those years (I would say moderately rough scratching). I also seem to have developed scar tissue, whether that is related to one of the various scarring alopecia conditions I do not know, although some follicles have survived and survive haircuts in random spots along the supposed scar lines (I have yet to find a Google Image corresponding to the scars I have).. I also think I may have lichen planopilaris on one specific area of my forehead but not sure while I have several scales/scabs across my forehaed too.\n\nNow after initial research that would suggest I am in for considerable permanent hairloss (which I may or may not look to replace with a transplant) but I have noticed various vellus hairs (peach fuzz) across all these areas of my forehead close to and sometimes overlapping the scar lines (and some have progressed into slightly longer thicker hairs). So I am confused as to why these vellus hairs are still there and would be doubtful about whether most of them could progress to at least, somewhat thicker hairs? I have not really given my head a break from scratching over lengthy periods so have not given these hairs a chance to develop from inflammation ceasing. I would suspect that the vast majority, if not all of my follicles are dead in the areas with vellus hair, but would like some feedback? For one, you should not be scratching your scalp. That is a surefire way to damage the follicles and invite more hairloss. For two, no one here will know what you have, the extent of the damage, and prognosis as you need to be examined by a dermatologist ASAP. The sooner the better. The most important thing with scarring alopecias is getting the inflammation done to prevent further scarring otherwise no hairloss treatment or hair transplant will ever work (scarring alopecias attack the transplanted follicles). Anyway, see a derm pronto. GL!", "How long did it take for the LPP to give you bald spots? For example, a matter of months?  I mostly have diffuse thinning. My actual bald spots that are completely scarred and will not come back are very small after two years (timeline might be longer due to a series of bad dermatologists prior to actual diagnosis). The bald spots are more concentrated on the crown of my head where my pain/redness is always the most intense. That area looks thinner, I KNOW it is way worse compared to how my scalp was pre-LPP, but nobody can notice it.\n\nI have heard some people progress at a faster rate, though. What kind of other symptoms did you have or do have? Pustules? Flaking? Significant hairloss, scalp was very red, severe pain (hurt if my hair moved), severe itchiness, flaking (but very tiny, not like typical dandruff???), bumps/sores (not sure if these were pustules). \n\nThe best thing to do is request a scalp biopsy if you have not already been diagnosed with LPP or another scarring alopecia. I have hair shedding redness pustules slightly flaking. I have been dealing with it for a few years first thought it was folliculitis been on antibiotics and antifungals. Recently this year derm thought it was seb derm but now I am getting really scared and think it is a scarring alopecia and am going to ask my derm for a biopsy. I was going to have one ages ago but they started saying they needed multiple sections when I thought it would be one It depends on severity and how well you can keep it under control with treatment but I have had Folliculitis Decalvans for over a decade and have a bald spot on my crown and some light thinning but a good amount of hair everywhere else How big in measurements are the balding spots? I have some spots that are bald but so tiny like a pencil eraser size or smaller. These bald areas are mixed with diffuse thinning. They are about that size, dispersed as well but majority on top and crown of head. My hair just feels thin now. When I buzzed my head you could clearly see the pencil eraser dots all over. Derm has checked them and they do not have follicles anymore :/ What do you believe caused your lichen planopilaris? The strange thing with me is I mentioned scarring alopecia to all of my dermatologists and trichologists and none find anything like this, even after using a trichoscope. All just say it is androgenetic alopecia. I wonder if they just do not check carefully enough or if it is an area smaller than a certain size they just dismiss it. It could be my long hair covers too much surface, so they do not see what they should to make proper analysis. Wondering if you tried microneedling these areas? If you did did you notice any improvement in fullness? What do they say about the spots without follicles? My derm said she needed a biopsy to see what kind of inflammation I had, that is how I was diagnosed.\n\nNo idea what caused it. High stress, environmental factors, something simple like shampoos with harsh ingredients. Who knows. I have not tried microneedling. I have very sensitive skin so the chance of doing it incorrectly and inflamming my scalp seems high. Not something I would like to risk.\n\nOTC treatments include red light comb/therapy, changing shampoos, cbd lotion, LDN (there are a few places that sell it online), diet changes (plant based diet - apparently animal fats can contribute to inflammation). \n\nWhen I do these things my scalp gets better but my hair loss is still present. It is slow, but present. My scarring alopecia presents as a red, burning, painful scalp with scaling. If you do not experience these things you likely have something else or at the very least, a slow progression of a scarring alopecia. \n\nHope it is not scarring!", "Folliculitis Decalvans in the Era of Antibiotic Resistance  This is an interesting white paper that finds elevated S Aureus bacterial antibiotic resistance in FD patients relative to the general population.

All are welcome to post, whether you have Folliculitis Decalvans, Lichen Planopilaris, Central Centrifugal Alopecia, Dissecting Cellulitis, or something else entirely. For my Folliculitis Decalvans, my two most effective treatments have been a multi-year course of the Rifampin/Clindamycin combo that was stopped due to long-term antibiotic concerns, and a high dose (80mg) 11 month course of Isotretinoin. Both led to marked decreases in pustules and inflammation but no remission.\n\nI have also seen some results with topical Clindamycin and topical Clobetasol. I am currently on Keflex 500mg once daily which is not doing much, but twice daily did offer some level of control. \n\nI do not have many pustules any more, just inflammation and white scaling.

Folliculitis Devalvans (Have it since 6 years, but only in April this year i got an official diagnosis).\n\nI have only had minor hairloss, but had a lot of pustules and a very heavy itching. Went to three different doctors before I went into a dermatological clinic (where I got my diagnosis), which all gave me countless gels, shampoos, cremes etc. and nothing helped. Got some minor antibiotics for acne, which did help a bit, but after i discontinued my symptoms it came back very fast.\n\nSince my diagnosis (so almost 6 months) i am taking rifampicin and clindamycin, 2 times a day each with a 300 mg dosis. Which already helped a lot better than any antibiotic before. I still have the occasional itching and some spots left, but my quality of life has improved very much.\n\nIn about 2 weeks im discontinuing the clindamycin pills and instead use a topical combination of clindamycin and some agent I cannot remember rn on top of continuing my usual dose of rifampicin.   Hope that this helps as much as the pills I am using CLn Shampoo. Hard to tell if it is helping because I am on Rifampin and Minocycline. Definitely does not seem to be hurting things. I do not use it every day. How often do you shampoo? I have a bottle of CLn in my shower now actually. I shampoo about 4 times a week. I am mostly using Nizoral now but also like Head &amp; Showers Thick and Full. I may have to try CLn again to see if it helps. Following a Gluten &amp; Dairy free diet helped me massively. \n\nI took an allergy test and was unaware that I was allergic to gluten. I noticed when I cut Gluten from my diet, my scalp improved. I also found that dairy triggered small breakouts on my scalp so I also removed Dairy from my diet.\n\nI supplement pro biotics, cod liver oil and homemade tumeric/black pepper capsules. \n\nI use 2 different types of shampoo. \n1.

The solution, not the gel. The gel made things worse. My scalp is less tender and hair has been regrowing and thickening in some parts.

He has tried cortisone shots (seemed to help a tiny bit), akamin, and clobestasol. It is definitely getting worse and I am concerned he is going to go bald. We are unsure what to do. Any help would be so greatly appreciated. We are located in Sydney Australia. For me, the best things that have helped me have been clindamycin gel and neosporin extra strength. The neosporin does wonders and they have a pain relief one that can soothe the burning sensation. The other thing I do is keep my hair short. I dunno if any of these will help him but if it has not been done yet, it is worth a try. the only thing that seemed to keep mine under control for an extended period was isotretinoin.  It did not cure me but two rounds of this medication seem to have helped my condition.  Be aware that when I first used this medication the FD got worse before it got better, this is common when it is used for acne as well. Mine got so bad on my first month of isotretinoin that I could not continue the treatment. Some of the worst pain I have experienced. The only thing that is marginally worked for me is washing my scalp daily with hibiclens. While it has not made it any better, it is at least kept it under control for the past four-ish months I have been using it. So sorry he and you are dealing with this. Need to find good derm asap and work on calming the inflammation. Do an elimination diet as well, no sugar, no dairy, no gluten, no soy, no corn. Mine was very painful as well when I started the treatment, antibiotics worked great for a period of time but then they stopped working.  They prescribed me some kind of topical steroid but that did not do much of anything for me.  My FD is somewhat under control now after the two rounds of isotretinoin, I still have it but it seems to have lost its intensity and my scalp is no longer throbbing in pain. Best of luck to you. Clindamycin also worked for me I am in Sydney too.  Clindamycin worked for me, after a few months using it my flare ups became very mild and I now do not need to use it at all.  My hair grew back and the scarring went away.\n\nI also recommend experimenting with diet.  Cut out gluten and try keto.  It helps with me. Thank you so much! Thank you so much - it is appreciated. It is so hard for him when it is such a rare condition. I should add that it was topical clindamycine\nIt was not an oral antibiotic.  Tell your husband to avoid being put on oral antibiotics.  I was put on them for a year end a half by a clueless dermatologist and it caused severe damage to my gut.  I have developed other medical conditions because of it.\n\nIt was only when the oral antibiotics stopped working that I saw another derm and she put me on the topical treatment.  I never had to see her again.\n\nSo, yes, please try all the topical stuff first. I would like to stress the \"getting worse before better\" mine got really bad before it got better. My fd is still active but it does not effect my daily life. I am still loosing hair but at least no more strong pain. It took 6 months to start sensing change and now i am hoping to keep getting better.\n\nMy doctor also gave me topical erythromycin. Many in this community tried topical clindamycin. From the comments i think clindamycin works better but erythromycin is somehow helpful. (Topical)\n\nThe alternative would be a long course of systematic antibiotics. Usually a combination of clindamycin and rifampin. This should knock it out  problem is the remission is not long term. How is his scalp doing now? The Rifampin/Clindamycin combo is good at getting it under control but personally isotretinoin was the best at permanently reducing the inflammation intensity and pustular activity. Hey.

As some of you mention in your posts, it began as small pimples on my scalp, that then began to itch and burn. Possible reasons of onset: stress, did not wash hair after gym once or twice, but not fully sure...\n\nThroughout my battle, I have been fortunate enough to have undergone both medical and natural treatments, both of which have helped, but not totally cured this condition.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n\\- Medical: I have been placed on clindamycin + keflex a few times by my dermatologist.  The flare ups were quite intense the first two years to the extent that my scalp would burn when I would put it on my pillow at night. Thankfully, clindamycin on its own was a life-saver then.\n\n\\- Diet: began eating a healthier diet. Prior to symptoms, I also ate generally healthy, but now I have given more attention to cutting out sugars, and limiting dairy. (Though, I need to gain weight and milk would help!)\n\n\\-Natural treatments: I have had the opportunity to have hijama done on my scalp a few times. Hijama is essentially wet cupping, and was a routine practice of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Given the spiritual dimension of this treatment, I personally found it encouraging to turn my concern to God.\n\nIn addition, applying natural oils and using tea tree oil shampoo have been gentle and soothing. Turmeric is also a great anti-inflammatory ingredient I incorporated with oil and massaged into my scalp. However, I believe the benefits do not last too long via physical application, so I have also incorporated this more into my diet.\n\n\\- Mental health: Tying into my last point above, I think it has been important not to overthink about my problems. I feel like the more I think I about it, the more stress I put on my scalp, leading to further buildup. So, in general, I would say to keep care of your mental health as well. Our physical, mental, and spiritual lives are all linked. Exercise the brain and body regularly.\n\nThanks for reading - I hope this benefits you. Let us keep going strong in our healing!

I just want to share my story on Foliculitis Decalvans and what steps I have taken to control the condition.\n\nI developed scalp foliculitis in 2016. It cleared after a dose of anti-biotics (cannot remember which ones). A year later it returned and it was alot worse than before. \n\nI seen countless doctors and I finally got diagnosed with FD at a Dermatologist when I was living in Australia.\nThis guy tried me on a course of doxycycline which did not work. He then recommended Accutane, I took this for roughly 6 months on and off. Accutane seemed to clear my scalp but as soon as I stopped taking them, I broke out again. \n\n1. I purchased CLn Shampoo online which took my bumps from 8/10 to 6/10 and helped alot with itching when my scalp was inflamed.\n\n2. I eliminated dairy from my diet for 2 weeks and noticed an improvement. \nI purchased an allergy test online for \u00a37. I sent away a few strands of hair to the company and the results indicated that I was allergic to Gluten.\n\n3. I then followed a Gluten Free diet which reduced my bumps to 4/10 after several weeks.\n\n4. I supplement cod liver oil, homemade tumeric &amp; black pepper capsules, immune system tablets (immunace) &amp; probiotics (Bio Cultures).\nThese supplements brought me down to 2/10. I noticed alot of improvement after using the probiotics.\n\n5. I have purchased Neutrogena T/Gel shampoo which helps clean my hair and take care of dandruff.  I now use the 2 shampoos together every other day.\n\n6. The final product I use on my scalp Is 'Silver Cleanse 45ppm'. I read somewhere that this product can help kill any reoccurring pustules by attacking underneath the skin. In my case, I usually get the same bumps appearing around my crown during a break out. \n\n'Silver Cleanse' has now reduced my scalp rating to a 1/10 which I am extremely grateful for considering I thought there was no way around this condition just 6 months ago. \n\n***SUMMARY***\nI have no doubts that gut health and foliculitis are heavily linked. So I recommend taking an allergy test along with removing dairy and/or gluten from your diet. Followed by supplementing probiotics. What is the name of the allergy test? I would like to try one but am short on cash and kind of doubt the accuracy. The one you used seems affordable. Thanks for sharing! I will try removing gluten and dairy. Which probiotic do you recommend? ***UPDATE***\n\nI now seem to have full control of FD. After using all of the products/methods listed in the original post, I have since bought Neutrogena Stubborn Acne Wash (10% Benozyl Peroxide) and I have had a completely clear scalp for several weeks now. \n\nThis face wash cost me \u00a315 on Amazon and I am considering cutting other products out to save money.\n\nI still follow a Gluten Free &amp; Dairy Free diet, without being 100% strict on it and I also still use the supplements listed above. \n\nI finished the Neutrogena T/Gel Shampoo (\u00a310) &amp; Silver Cleanse (\u00a320). I plan on removing the CLn shampoo once it is empty, as this is the most expensive product at \u00a328.50. Where on your body do you use the neutrogena stubborn acne wash? UKFoodIntolerance On my scalp How is your scalp doing now? Do you think you will be able to control your inflammation with the benzoyl peroxide and your dairy and gluten free diet? I just started exclusively using CLn Gentle Shampoo to officially cross that off the list but want to try your BP shower routine next. My scalp is amazing. I think the BP has really made the difference. I am now able to cut my hair really short without any signs of bumps or bald patches. I have been bump free since before Christmas! Sometimes I can feel a bump about to surface, so I directly apply the BP on it and it always seems to do the trick. \n\nHave you made any progress yet? Awesome! My scalp is typically around a 3 or 4 out of 10 now, but it was a lot worse years ago after I was first diagnosed with Folliculitis Decalvans. I am not using medicine at the moment, just the CLn shampoo. \n\nCan you please post your specific routine details and product name here for everyone? I purchased Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Daily Leave On Mask 2.5% a while ago and found I could not easily apply it broadly on my scalp, but I never tried it in the shower and it sounds like you are using a different product. Thanks! I have never tried the leave on mask, just the facewash. At the start, I would use it every day in the shower. Once i apply it to my scalp i would not rinse it off until i had washed the rest of my body. I was also generous with the amount I put on. \n\nNow i only apply it every second day as my scalp is now great and i only get the odd bump from time to time.\n\n( Have you made any changes to your diet with regards to taking supplements and eliminating gluten/dairy? I have tried Whole 30 once but the results were inconclusive. My scalp was mostly the same, maybe slightly better. I have a few questions: How much of your scalp improvement would you attribute to diet? Which one had a greater impact, gluten or dairy? How long did it take to see scalp improvement from your diet? I think Gut health is key to curing the condition. After I cut Gluten and Dairy whilst taking several supplements including probiotics, I seemed to have barely any flare ups. I procrastinated in changing my diet at the start as it seemed like a big effort and I would miss out on alot of foods but im glad i did it and I do not think I could have cured it without changing my diet. \n\n\nI originally thought dairy was the problem but after taking an allergy test which stated I was allergic to Gluten I cut them both out at the same time. So I am not really sure which one had greater impact. \n\nI cannot remember the exact timeline but I was patient and strictly removed them for about a month to begin with. Now I eat gluten and dairy from time to time but do not have any flare ups.", "SMP for FD Hey Guys\n\nIm 28 years old and have recently been diagnosed with FD, although have been suffering from widespread folliculitis for years which I did not receive any treatment for as it never bothered me enough.

Last year I grew my hair out and started styling it for the first time since elementary school. The longer my hair the better the condition seems to be.\n\nMy treatment at first was Accutane prescribed by my first dermatologist. That did not do much for my scalp at all. Just dried out my skin and lips.   I was prescribed some sort of cream to apply but I cannot remember what it was called. It helped keep the scabs under control but caused a lot of bleeding at night and when showering.  After years of trying different things I pretty much gave up and stopped seeing Derms for the condition. For years I have kept the situation under control with essential oils. I use nightly, Almond Oil (base) and add natural anti-flamatories like rose oil and murr oil.   If I miss even one night of applying the scabs flare up pretty bad and it is really nasty to shower and clear them out.

That may be what I just blame it on. Because there is not an exact cause, I am really hard on myself and in some way believe that I could have prevented it. I have no way to know if that is true.\n\nMy Belief in Effective Natural Treatments:\n\nWhile no cure has been officially found or clinically proven to me or my dermatologists' knowledge, it appears that in my case the biggest natural \"cure\" I have had was severely limiting my diet to raw foods. (Foods that basically do not have an ingredients list). Also cutting out dairy seemed to make a marked impact when I had severe acne, and also appears to be the case here.\n\n\\-----Changing diet\n\n\\-----TONS of water,  not way too much, but enough that your pee is almost always clear.\n\n\\-----Showering 2 or 3 x a week and removing the use of conditioner completely.

My belief as to why antibiotics stop working eventually is because S. Aureus becomes resistant to each antibiotic as it is practically impossible to remove from your body as it is basically part of it. \n\nI just got off an 8 week course of clindamycin and rifampin (where I was probably 95-98% clear), but unfortunately i am relapsing but it is unclear why.

Hi,  thanks for sharing.how are you getting on? Have you tried anything that is helped you, I have only recently been diagnosed and I am on doxycycline, but know when I get off them that it will come straight back, I have sent for colloidal silver ( google it and also bentonite clay) to see if they may help, I will let you know if I get some relief with them. So far I have tried everything you can think of with no improvement. Hi,\n\nI have been doing fairly well for the most part. I have been off drugs since early August and only have had two breakouts. The second one has been this weekend which has really sucked. I am trying to digest what may have caused it! I know that I drank wine friday, ate pasta Saturday, and consumed a lot of fruit the past 4 or 5 days. I believe that I have made my condition worse by seeking help from dermatologists as antibiotics cause an even greater imbalance. I also think that the condition as a whole was triggered for me by thrush that was probably caused by one of the medications I take for asthma. I have a fair bit of evidence supporting this theory. It is very difficult to know what will help, because at least in my case my dermatologists clearly do not know what causes or triggers it. I think that the root of our solutions lie in knowing the causes.\n\nCan you give me some background info of your life pre symptoms to now? Some general information about weight, sex, age information could also be helpful. I am interested in finding out causes and triggers to \"naturally\" find solutions to this condition.

As I come to the end of each antibiotics the pain comes straight back  and I know if left without antibiotics i will develop lots of boils, it is mostly all on my left side of head but the crown is affected and now the whole of the left hand side of my head pains and aches into my neck and my glands, I do not know if the hair loss was part of this starting or if it might have been a reaction to the change of products., I have continued to shed hair but it has definitely slowed, it started back in April, my searching has led me to colloidal silver , which is on its way this week  , to apply directly and to take orally, I have read that it actually changes the DNA of staph, helping to eradicate it, also bentonite clay to draw out toxins, I will let you know if this has any effect. I try to be gluten free , and sugar free, I eat fermented veg, and take probiotics, but do quite regularly fall off the wagon, and I do enjoy my wine, but like I said I am on meds at the moment so cannot really track progress or the negatives of my diet.

Please keep me informed of any changes good and bad, and I really hope you get success in your effort to heal yourself . I have also been advised to follow a no sugar, no starch diet. It is extremely difficult to follow. Thrush basically is candida and it is odd that no dermatologists that I have had really acknowledge it.

I recently had a visit with my dermatologist and discussed various options. I have been on a combination of isotretinoin (80mg), rifampin, and clindamycin for about 9 months now. After seeing improvement she decided to halve my isotretinoin dosage to 40mg daily. For the past few months I have seen negligible pustular activity, just general inflammation and flaking/dryness/itching that can hopefully be primarily attributed to the high isotretinoin dosage. I am going to continue 40mg for a bit to see if some of that dissipates but I am cautiously optimistic at the moment.

Usually there is inflammation and redness associated with scarring alopecia along with itching, burning, tenderness, and/or pain. I dont see that by your photos but idk. Of course, I am not a physician and only repeating my understanding of the disease as you should be examined. You may have other issues going on non scarring hairloss related such as some hormonal or vitamin issue. Just starting minoxidil would be ill advised if you do not know what is triggering your hairloss. Within the scarring alopecia it is also commonly thought that diet commonly has something to do with flareups and inflammation of the disease and many people use the AIP diet or go low histamine. Thanks for your reply. That is what is confusing me myself. I am aware it is minimal for now but it is definitely picking up and I think it will be only a matter of time before there is a noticeable bald patch, I do have the odd discoloured patchs on my scalp, burning at the crown in the night and some itching, also multiple hairs coming out of one follicle\nVery very mild though if it was not for Google I would not have thought it was scarring myself\nMy pubic area has also lost hair my eyebrows and eyelashes seem to be falling out easier than they used to. It is the scariest thing that is ever happened to me\nMy tsh levels etc were apparently normal. I was low on b12 a few months back went on tablets for a few months and now apparently my levels are normal again Start using anti dandruff shampoo such as nizoral and head and shoulders extra strength and look into a over the counter steroid cream to apply to problem spots. Zyrtec at 20-30mg a day is also effective for lpp. Also, the diet is a biggie. I dont know if you have lpp nor do you it sounds but some of things are rather harmless and low cost. and could tie you over until you can see a doctor. Anyway, see a doctor asap. Thanks for your advice I am now using dermovate scalp ointment and hoping for the best but the previous weaker steroid applications I have used have not helped at all sadly\nI am really thinking lpp just need a derm to confirm it.

It is ruined my life &amp; I still cannot believe how my life turned so upside down all of a sudden.  \n\nInformation seems scarce, and finding this subreddit has been a great find.. hoping to relate with some of you guys.  I will try post parts of my story later to maybe inspire you guys to have more ideas on how we can beat this.\n\nI am constantly reminded of my condition through the almost constant stinging &amp; burning pain on my scalp, and that is what is been wrecking me the most till now.  It is hard to focus @ work.  It is also hard to focus to have fun.  My relationship has also taken a toll due to the current \"depression\".\n\nDo you think they really are working on a cure?  My impression is that it is not considered an issue at all :(\n\n**--My Story--** *(Note:  Some stuff might sound unrelated, but I included this stuff because I feel it might in some way be related after all)*\n\nI am 28 years old &amp; have been suffering from Acne since the age of 13. When I was about 15 years old, I was prescribed isotretinoin, and after taking it for a few months, I stopped treatment abruptly because it was drying my skin too much.  I suffered with acne for the rest of my life, as the treatment did not work as expected.\n\nFast forward 12 years.  I had the budget &amp; will to tackle my acne problem again, so I visited a new dermatologist who, to my shock, prescribed me isotretinoin again.  It took me a week to decide whether or not to go ahead with this.  I decided to go ahead with the isotretinoin 40mg daily + clindamycin 300mg BD as advised.\n\nA month into this treatment, I felt things were improving &amp; that I was coping well with the side effects.  Me &amp; my self esteem were excited that there was a good chance my life would finally take a positive turn.  My dermatologist agreed that things were looking good, and increased my dosage from 40mg to 70mg daily, while discontinuing the clindamycin.  (I was prescribed clindamycin because I used to have severe temporary folliculitis break-outs occasionally, so its point was to prevent any flare-ups while starting with isotretinoin)\n\nAbout 2 weeks into the 70mg period, I noticed a small scab on my scalp which I attributed to the dryness, and did not worry much about it.  In my visit to the dermatologist around the same time, he did check my scalp &amp; found nothing of concern.  I did not mention it because I thought he would notice if it was of any concern.\n\nThe scalp condition kept getting worse &amp; on my next visit during March 2014, my dermatologist diagnosed it as cellulitis, probably triggered by isotretinoin itself.  My dose of isotretinoin was lowered to 40mg daily &amp; prescribed clindamycin again 300mg 4 times a day for 2 weeks.  I was also prescribed a Betadine wash to shampoo my hair twice daily with.  I was noticing no improvement, when one week into this, I had an appendix attack, rushed to hospital &amp; underwent surgery.  My clindamycin was prescribed intravenously during my hospital stay.  \n\nAfter 5 days of recovery, on the advice of my dermatologist, I continued my prescription of isotretinoin &amp; continued clindamycin @ 300mg BD.  In the following weeks, my clindamycin dosage varied from 150mg BD to 300mg BD to 300mg FD.  Nothing worked, and then I was prescribed Prednisolone 30mg daily with tapering for a month.  This did not work either.\n\nIt was on my next visit in the beginning of June 2014 that my dermatologist advised to stop the isotretinoin course completely, so we could treat the scalp condition exclusively.  This is when I was diagnosed with Folliculitis Decalvans.  I was prescribed Rifampicin 300mg BD + Clindamycin 300mg BD, and advised to keep washing my hair with Betadine daily.  In the meantime, I was still tapering down on the prednisolone.\n\nTowards the end of June, my condition was either getting worse or not improving at all - I was not sure.  So I panicked &amp; visited an expert in infectious diseases who suggested a culture swab to determine what organism(s) might be causing the Folliculitis Decalvans.  **Pseudomonas Aeruginosa** and **Leclercia adecarboxylata** were cultured from the swab.  These two types of bacteria were found to be sensitive to a range of antibiotics, so I was prescribed one of them - ciprofloxacin 500mg BD + rifampicin 300mg BD for 1 month.  I was now hopeful.\n\n3 weeks into this, I was still not feeling or seeing any improvement so I called my dermatologist in panic.  He suggested I have a skin biopsy so that maybe it would result in more information.  He agreed to perform the biopsy a couple of days later, after which he prescribed clindamycin 300mg BD for a month till we waited for the results.  I thought it strange that I was stopping the rifampicin, but I am not the expert.\n\nOne month later, the biopsy results stated that \"*Cicatrical alopecia consistent with, but not entirely characteristic of folliculitis decalvans.  Central centrifugal cicatrical alopecia and acne keloidalis are the main histologic differential diagnosis*\".  I was prescribed rifampicin 300mg BD + clindamycin 300mg BD again, for another 2 months.  I felt like it was time to give up.\n\nNow I am into my 7th week of these 2 months, and still no significant improvement.  I have just been prescribed a Zineryt lotion to apply to the affected areas twice a day, but have noticed no improvement yet.  It has actually made it worse, as the skin gets all red &amp; peeled.. but this is one of its possible side effects.\n\n--**The End**--\n\n\nPhew.  I hope my story will inspire you to detect some patterns from the research you have made &amp; from your personal experience.  How long should the rifampin/clinda take to work?  Am I expecting results too early?  Am I messed up for having different interrupted bouts of this treatment?\n\n\n*Update*: I have tried another 2 months of Rifampicin+Clinda, another 1 month of Dapsone, and currently into my 4th week of minocycline 100mg BD + metronidazole 400mg BD.   The situation has not ever improved and my scalp often burns like hell, which invokes a sense of despair.  If only I could at least control the inflammation..\n\n*Update 27/05/2015*:  Into my 8th week of minocycline.  Still nothing.  Also, the chronic folliculitis at the back of my head is back with a vengeance, so double the trouble.  Locked up inside &amp; rotting - that is how I feel at the moment.  Photos here:  ", "Hi, 18 and a Decalvans patient as well Since late 2014 I have had Folliculitis Decalvans on the scalp only, but I did not know about the condition until September of 2015. In reality I am lucky I got diagnosed correctly in under a year since I have heard some really unfortunate stories of being mistreated for years. \n\nHonestly, the toughest part is the sleeping. I can handle the itching and stinging during the day but when I want to sleep and cannot put my head on the pillow in any direction at all, it makes me cranky. It is hard to focus on tasks as the itching can intesify, and showering is an extremely painful experience as it takes a minute to just put the shampoo on my head. \n\nThe longest that I have controlled this for has been 3 and a half months. Now it is back and I am getting cranky again. \n\nWhat really troubles me is that an antibiotic only starts to work when condition is at its worst. It never works when it rapidly increases in pain and surface area. \n\nMynomycin has been surprisingly good to me. I have used that for 3 continuous months and it worked well until it started getting worse again. Now I have changed to another medication much stronger and it is not working at the moment but I have to give it time, it is been only a week and I have only taken 4 tablets. \n\nFD is a really unfortunate thing to have because it is not life threatening but it sure can worsen your overall mood and thus mental health as well. It is also very rare making it even more unfortunate. \n\nIt is a tough road, but I am fighting it and hopefully it will get better in a week or two (that is usually the time it takes).", "Some thoughts Hey everyone, had some late night thoughts that I wanted to put down on paper and clear my head. \n\nAfter 12 years of living with Folliculitis Decalvans, I wanted to pause and reflect for a moment. I wish I could go back and shake my younger self for letting this disease consume so much of my youth with worry, stress, and hopelessness. Scarring hair loss affects my physical appearance, but it does not define me or my self worth. \n\nThere have been countless days where I felt embarrassed or ashamed and countless nights where I have stayed up late researching cures and treatments. I always keep a comb on me and instinctively avoid mirrors. Even in the early years in high school and college where the thinning was barely noticeable, I let it take up entirely too much of my time and headspace. Other people do not notice or care about my condition remotely as much as I might think they do.\n\nWe always seek to assign blame for something that causes us pain or distress, but scarring hair loss **is not our fault**. The root cause is unknown and while it is okay to hope for a cure in the future, I cannot let it affect the present. Life is too short and time is too precious to let something out of my control weigh me down.\n\nSo if you are still reading this, give it a try. Try to let go, worry less, and enjoy the present. We got unlucky with this disease but that does not mean it gets to dictate our future. One day there will be a cure, but until then I am going to put in every effort to live the same life I would without this condition. I choose to be happy and not let it win.\n\nSincerely,\nDecalvans", "Microbiology of folliculitis decalvans: a histological study of 37 patients ", "Successful treatment of refractory folliculitis decalvans with Apremilast (Otezla)  Interesting new white paper with promising early results of Folliculitis Decalvans remission after treatment with Apremilast (Otezla) monotherapy.

I assume this works similarly to biologics like Humira.

Buy some 10% benzoyl peroxide face wash and use it like shampoo on the area after you have washed your hair with normal shampoo. Should help at least some! Is it the non scarring type? Thank you I will get some BPO as we speak How long do you usually leave the BP on? I have read people leaving it on overnight. Would not that bleach the hair? I usually lather it in like shampoo and then wait maybe 60 seconds before rinsing.  It actually does not bleach your hair, which I also found surprising bc of how many times benzoyl peroxide has bleached my towels/sheets/etc. I think it has something to do with the amount of time exposed to benzoyl peroxide, so it would maybe bleach it if you left it on your hair for a long period of time (like, over 8 hours). Good question but not something to worry about. To be honest, I am not sure. I would assume it would only scar if you are flaring up nonstop and the spots are not getting a chance to heal. I would argue that if the BP helps keep some spots at bay, then it most likely will not leave scarring (provided you are not picking at the spots).

", "Just got diagnosed Hi everyone. \nI am 24 year old dude and I am stressing out a bit, so any help and/or advice and/or words of comfort would be appreciated. So my struggle started around 4 years ago when I first noticed bald patches in my beard. The hair grew back each time after 2-3 months, maybe more, so it never really bothered me. I was at a dermathologist first time 3 years ago and he did say I have chronic folliculitis and put me on Azithromycin for 4 weeks (one per day for 3 days, and then one per week for 3 weeks). As I recall it worked for about 4-6 months, now I am back and even worse, since I fucked up and did not put much thought all these years.\n\nSince then, I have constant boils with bald patches in my beard and it started to appear on my chest and pubic hair. The chest is constantly with boils for about 2 years now and the pubic hair is occaisonaly flaring up with one or two boils (although I had my first, and so far my only scar there). \n\nMy anxiety started when I noticed two boils with bald patches in my scalp one month ago. That is when I started researching about this (since my dermathologists did not really bother all these years). I am waiting again for the samples, I expect Staph since I had it the first time but two times since then I came back negative. They got me on Minocycline for two weeks two a day, topic clyndamicin and some shampoo that had clyndamicine also. They also said I should throw away sugar, bread and carbs completely.\n\nI just wanted to say...I have a lot of anxiety about this, I know it is my fu*king fault because of how passive I was all these years...The last two weeks were hell for me, so any positive thing you can say will help me a great deal.\nIt does not bother me in the beard, but the patches in my scalp are giving me nightmares (even though one is starting to show hair so I hope it is not scarring)\n\nThank you a lot in advance Aww, I am so sorry you are suffering from this, especially other places of the body. Hopefully, I can help some.\n\nFor diet, I find when I limit gluten or go completely gluten free, the inflammation on my scalp sores go way down and my scalp feels smooth, no more pustules. \n\nI find when I use ketoconazole shampoo that it helps decrease inflammation and breaks up scabs, dead skin, whatever the heck is going on up there. Hello!\n\nThere are quite a few things that do not make sense to me, so I was hoping you could give us more details so we can help you properly. \n\n\"Chronic folliculitis\" is not a proper diagnosis. It is just the a definition of what is happening. Do you know exactly what you have? The name of the condition? Let me give you a few examples \"Alopecia Aerata\", \"Lichen Planopilaris\", \"Folliculitis Decalvans\" and so on. Do not google any of that by the way, they were just examples, not related of what you are describing\"\n\nDid you have a biopsy? Do you have inflamed, itchy areas? Do you know if it is a \"scarring alopecia\"? I do not know the name of it, the diagnosis the dermathologist wrote is folliculitis and perifolliculitis, I am currently waiting for a swab from one of the acne on my chin, but not a biopsy so far...Everything is itchy, my chest, scalp and pubic area, that is how I know when there will be puss filled boils (which as I understand are the inflamed areas).\nI do not know if it is a \"scarring\" alopecia, but as I said I lose hair very often and everywhere when I have a boil, and so far I believe I have one scar in my pubic area, the hair has not grown for more than a year. Maybe this is not the right subreddit for me, I still do not understand a lot of stuff. oh, and my lymph gland in the chin is swollen so they said it has to be Staph. It looks like a bacterial folliculitis. This might be the right reddit for you because those can also cause scarring. You should act fast to avoid it. But first you should ask the exact name of what you have because folliculitis literally means Inflammation of the follicle and perifolliculitis means Inflammation around the follicle. Both are more like descriptions not the disease itself. It is more like a generic definition. You should get a swab, a biopsy and a second opinion. Puss and swollen lymph nodes suggest infection that causes inflammation that leads to scarring. If you treat the infection, everything else will solve by itself. I am sorry to hear this, i hope you find treatment that help you, there are some things i can list here that i found on the internet.\n\nDiet is recommended by many, i personally have not got very lucky but also never persistent. And this is something that only pays off after few months. But try with eliminating diary, highly sugar processed food and drinks. Junk food is bad for inflation. Gluten might cause folliculitis (no scientific evidence) but many users reported improvement with cutting gluten.\n\nTreatment: there are many, but it is important you get a specific proper diagnosis. Your doctor might prescribe you antibiotics, isotretinoin, or something else. But overall science shows improvements sometimes full remission for people with folliculitis.\n\nIf you can afford it and it is not a personal problem, laser your pubic area. You can test with a small area if it works then one less problem to worry about.\n\n\nKeep your hair clothes and bed clean. Do not over wash your hair and skin. Cosmetics and soap might compromise skin barrier leading to more itching more scratching more bacteria...", "Just got diagnosed with Foliculitis Decalvans, looking for advice. Hi everyone, (this is my first ever post , and I am not english native, so please, cut me some slack)\n\nAs I \\ just said in the title, just got diagnosed with Fuliculitis Decalvans. About a month or two ago I started to experience itchiness, inflamation and hair loss in the back of my scalp. Went to the general doctor a couple of times, while i could not get a consultation with a dermatologist. There I got prescribed, antibiotics and anti-inflamatories, cannot give you the specific names as im not home rn (dont even know if its relevant). Just got out of the consultation with the dermatologist, where after just a little look he diagnosed me with Foliculitis Decalvans. He told me there is no permanent cure, and its manageable with antibiotics, even though he didnt prescribe me any, since its \"dorment\" rn.\n\nMy main question is how should i proceed. He told me surgery would not be the best idea as it would leave me with a huge scar, and not a lot of guarentees that it wouldnt come back.\n\nIm going to apoint a consultation with another dermatoligist, i have heard good things about. \n\nI have read some stuff already, mainly wikepedia and here, and would be happy if anyone could give some tips on how to proceed, and manage this (as in some hygiene tips, stuff to avoid, anything really) .\n\nAny help is apreciated.\n\nTL;DR : Just got diagnosed with FD, looking for any feedback about how to manage this thing. \n\nThank you in advance :) If you have already looked at my post and the one made by darpachief last week (9 days ago??)

Nothing works except for Accutane. It sucks if you lift or do any training cause joints will hurt so best take 6 months off. But totally worth it after 10years of taking clindamycin and tryi g treatments with rifampicin I got to a point where the condition got so severe that I could not sleep. Going to multiple 'professors' all told me that there was nothing to do.... I tried all crazy stuff washing my hair with Apple cider vinegar, special shampoos etc. They somewhat helped but only Accutane solved the problem. I finally found a docotor who stuckw with protocol took samples and it results there was not any microbial growth. She put me again on rifampicin which alleviated the.problem for 1 week and then she put me on Accutane. Been free of the condition for 2 years already now. 6months of 'pain' were well worth it my only regret is that I did not find this docotr before.

I do not have any qualified doctors in my area.

Does this look like scarring alopecia to you? I did search this forum but many people here seem to be treated with accutane as a treatment FOR scarring alopecia actually..\nBut yeah I have big regrets with accutane. Did you take accutane? First off, you must be under a lot of stress, I really do feel your pain and fear of what this is. Yes, I was treated for scalp inflammation, later diagnosed as FD, post accutane treatment. I got so many diagnosis, you have no idea. I have seen so many derms, for me they are just a waste of time. But one generally has to go down that path oneself to come to that realization, so you should get professional medical advice - if you can.\nPersonally I would read Grant Genereux\u2019s books on vitamin A (accutane is vitamin A) Two dermatologists looked at my scalp today with a dermatoscope and they couldnnt find anything abnormal.. what do I do from here? Should I get a biopsy? ThNk you so much. Im just very unsure about my hair situation. I mean ever since I took accutane my hair thinned out significantly but when looking at my scalp, everything seems normal. I also feel pain sometimes which is not common in MPB Why do you suspect it is scarring alopecia? Do you see scarring? I am not sure what you should do. Personally I am going low vitamin A, and hoping that will heal me, so far so good with basically no scalp inflammation left, so hoping the potential permanent damage from Accutane will heal itself too Because I am experiencing pain in my scalp.. but as you may have noticed im struggling with anxiety and this pain could be of psychological origin which I do not believe myself in but I have heard it several times Pain is unusual, sometimes the hair can thin and thicken throughout life here is to hoping everything returns to normal. Yeah the pain is in the front.. it just hurts sometimes when I move my hair around with my hand. Does this make scarring alopecia very likely? Interesting! Did you get this anxiety after accutane? I am asking because hypervitaminosis A symptoms are hair loss, and some get anxious and depressed. Some even severely depressed. Yes Possibly, with scarring alopecia there is usually inflammation but it is still possible without.\nYou will only know if you visit a dermatologist. I visited multiple dermatologists. Several dermatologists looked at my scalp with a dermatoscope but could not see anything abnormal Again, I would read Grant Genereux book Poisoning for profits, it is free on his website, I would also start a low vitamin A diet. This is just what I am doing, I am not a doctor, so this is no medical advice. I got referred myself to this diet about a year ago, on a board for accutane sufferers, and I have been on this diet for a while. I have no idea if this will cure me, but I am giving it my all, no dermatologist ever helped me, nor anyone else for that matter. Good luck! You also took accutane? Man fck this drug I do not understand how I was able to get it prescribed. Pure poison Yes! I know!", "I come here every night...

I really suffer when I do not sleep properly. \n\nI have been on isotretinoin for a week now... No sign of improvement and pain has gotten worse. I am clue less on how I can make things better and doctors to me seem like they are equally clueless. They tell me its a rare disease.... And thay pretty much it.\n\nI read here in thia group staying off milk helps. Is this true?? I drink 1L of milk daily and  dairy is quite important to me... But sleep it more important so if staying off milm reallh helps I might give it a try. Does anyone have experience on this?? I am sorry to hear you are having such a difficult time with this condition :(  I hope you manage to get some relief soon.\n\nI would recommend experimenting with dieting.  It is not easy, but I really think diet plays a huge role in things.  Cut out everything - no gluten, no dairy, only whole grains, vegetables, some red/white meat....do this for as long as you can, I suggest at least two or three months.  See if there is an improvement.  Afterwards you can start trying to reintroduce foods one at a time, to see if you react badly to them.  This way you can isolate the foods you are sensitive too and cut them out long term.\n\nIt is a pain, but diet is going to help, whatever medication you are taking.  \n\nAlso I do not know if you have tried it, but I have had a lot of success with the clindamycin topical treatment.  You apply it directly to the scalp, you do not take it orally.  In fact I have had so much success that I do not even need to use it anymore, and I only get very mild flare ups every now and then.  If you have not tried this, I recommend you do, because I had a dermatologist who put me on antibiotics from the get go, and they stopped working after a year.  The topical treatment is much better for your health, and like I said, I have had a lot of success with it.\n\nGood luck, and stay positive. I have been through everything you have described. Changing my diet was the only thing that did the trick for me. In my case, I am guessing that FD was probably a side-effect of an untested lactose intolerance. In your case, it can be because of an allergy or intolerance to something else.\n\nAt first, changing your diet seems like a daunting task, but it is easier than you might think. So my suggestion is, experiment with what you eat, just like hepheuua said.

An earlier post did mention a possibility of an overlap between FD and LPP. Clobetasol is strong and should not be used for a long term according to its label.

It started in earnest: small, painful bumps that formed near the crown of my head. My primary physician told me it was likely just an ingrown hair and would heal on its own. \n\nIt did not, of course, and soon there were more bumps. They became larger, more painful. Now they were not only on the crown of my head, but near my hairline, the back bottom of my head, and even on my face and neck. \n\nI come from a very low income American household and as such was unable to make frequent trips to the doctor, and especially not to a dermatologist. \n\nI would lose sleep because turning the wrong way would inflame or rupture a sore. I was afraid to go out because of the unsightly nature of my scalp. I would wake up with bloody pillows. \n\nI spent the better part of a decade cycling through various drugs, shampoos, diets, ointments, routines. I was always disappointed with the size of this community because of how debilitating this illness felt even though it is hard to show people that something that starts with \u201cfolliculitis\u201d is as serious as we say it is. \n\nThe problem started at 19, and only now at 30 do I finally feel like I have regained my life. I hope I can save some of you a decade. \n\n\n***ACTUAL ADVICE**\n\nPlease note that I am not a doctor, I recommend working with a physician on your treatment, and your mileage may and probably will vary. \n\n1. Hair and face care \n\nThe best thing for me has been to use a gentle, noncomedogenic shampoo without dyes, silicones, or parabens. My personal favorite is by Suave, and it is available almost everywhere you normally get your shampoo and without the premium price tag. \n\nI was originally told to use T-Gel, but I found the fact that it dries out your scalp, while helpful in the short term with inflammation, ended up producing too much oil and only served to exacerbate my flare ups down the line. I tried washing my hair every day. I tried washing it once a week, I tried not washing it. In the end, I wash my hair every day, but the gentle nature of the shampoo I use does not lend itself to an overly dry or oily scalp, and it helps to curb inflammation. It is important that the shampoo you use is free of silicones, parabens, and dyes.\n\nThe same goes for face and body wash. Find gentle cleansers that do not strip your body of its natural oils or protective barriers. \n\nLikewise, as a man, I typically do not completely shave my beard area because I have found that shaving down to stubble can increase the risk of ingrown hairs, which can become infected and triple in size of not properly cared for. \n\n2. Prescription medicine \n\nI cycled through various antibiotics over many years. One physician actually kept me on Minocycline for an entire year. As of this writing, I do not take any antibiotics, and my quality of life is as good or better as when I was in them, because of my adherence to routine. \n\nI would still recommend antibiotics for those suffering from a persistent outbreak. Clindamycine and Minocycline seem to be the best, but I do not believe they are necessary forever if you are diligent about your routine.\n\nThe most useful prescription I got was a topical steroid. Usually a cream or gel, applying these in moderation can slow the growth of, or help heal, small to medium sized sores. \n\nIf your sores are too large to properly care for, seek medical treatment, and get it taken care of. Ask for a steroid injection. I once had a huge sore (about as big as half a golf ball), and a local steroid injection, while somewhat painful, ended providing the kickstart I needed to begin to heal. \n\n3. Maintenance and Mitigation \n\nIf you already have a flare up, and you are having trouble sleeping, I would recommend you something that considerably improved my life:\n\nAn airplane pillow. \n\nIf you buy one at a store instead of an airport, they typically cost less than $10. When I am having a flare up, I pop on my airplane pillow which supports my neck and lower head while minimizing any possible friction from my sores hitting the pillow. The one I have even has a clasp so that it does not just fall off in the middle of the night. Seriously, get one.\n\nAs for those sores that are small to moderate sized, alternate cold and heat several times a day. The cold reduces inflammation, but may increase pain, so please limit your exposure to cold to just a few minutes. Immediately after icing, or if there is not a large amount of inflammation, use heat to draw the pus and blood to the surface. This will speed up the process of the sore bursting and draining. I recommend using tea bags and hot water for ease of use and disposal. \n\nI 100% do not recommend forcing a burst, or DIY lancing. My way reduces scarring and the possibility of the sore just enduring and regrowing. \n\nIf the sore breaks, use your fingers to gently but firmly push blood or pus towards the opening. A drained sore significantly reduces the chance of a reoccurrence in the same area. But it is also vitally important to approach from the sides, to be exceedingly gentle so as not to aggravate the wound, and to clean and disinfect often. \n\nI would also recommend getting some sunlight. Be careful if you are on any prescription medication that might make you sensitive to sunlight. Vitamin D is an essential source for boosting immune health and the health of your skin in general. But use su\n\n3. Diet\n\nMake no mistake, this is by far the most important step, and tragically, the hardest for most people. We are beholden to our routines.\n\nFD is a disease that has a nebulously defined root cause, but it is supremely evident that it works in tandem with inflammation. Reducing inflammation in your body will reduce the chance of flare ups, and will speed of the healing process of sores you already have. \n\nAs such, I have listed things you should remove or severely limit from your diet in order from most to least harmful. (To say it another way, the thing you read first should be the thing you remove first). \n\nHere are the most harmful things for you, in order of most to least harmful:\n\nDairy. Alcohol. Cigarettes. Carbohydrates. Processed Meats.\n\nDairy - I saw no bigger improvement in my daily life than when I stopped eating dairy. Some dermatologists are beginning to think that FD might even be a form of or cousin to lactose intolerance just because of how profound the effects are. \n\nAlcohol &amp; Cigarettes - Both are the most fun vices, I know. But because they cause inflammation in the longterm, and because they both have profound dependency properties, if they are a daily habit, the stress caused from withdrawal can contribute to flare ups. \n\nCarbohydrates - This is really only for foods with a high glycemic index; that is, candy and cakes and the like. Again, studies show that excess sugar intake causes inflammation, heart problems, and he addictive effects similar to drugs and alcohol.\n\nProcessed Meats - this is your slim jims, sausages, bacons, etc. I do not particularly have strong reactions to them but the chemicals and carcinogens involved with them may affect others differently. Red meat in general is a factor because of inflammation, so you might want to limit your intake to a couple times a week.\n\nI recommend looking into ketogenic or paleo diets as they have anecdotally decreased my inflammation, helped me lose and maintain my weight, and contributed to a better working knowledge of what I actually put in my body each day. \n\n\n\nIN CLOSING\n\nTo reiterate, as I write this, there is no cure. But I have achieved, through diligence, a normal life that is no longer centered around this terrible, isolating illness. \n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please leave them below.

I have a bunch of questions as I am trying to wrestle the best way to live with this condition.\n\n&gt;1.\t\u2060Do you use conditioner?\n\nI do not, but really only because I am one of those 5 minute shower and walk straight out the door type of people. Suave also makes a dye/silicone/parabens free conditioner in the same line as the shampoo I recommended above. \n\n&gt;2.\t\u2060Do you keep a short haircut?\n\nI seldom get my hair cut, usually once every couple months so as not to irritate my hair.

Right not I use as little as possible because I always felt like I was exacerbating some of my symptoms with products.\n\nI use Cerave foaming facial cleanser, I use their hydrating bar soap for my body, and their lotion for face and body. Great products, never irritate my skin. Highly recommended. \n\n&gt;4.\t\u2060I tried going vegan for a while but I needed a lot of carbs to not lose weight. I think the carbs may not be too great for me. So now I avoid dairy as much as I can and eat meat, but I am wondering if I should focus on just fish and maybe chicken?\n\nI eat a diet of mostly fish, eggs, chicken or turkey and green fibrous vegetables. I rarely eat red meat except for special occasions. I cannot pinpoint an effect of red meat specifically on ny FD, but I can definitely tell the difference in my joints when I eat red meat (I have early onset arthritis). \n\n&gt;5.\t\u2060In your experience has marijuana ever made an impact one way or another on your folliculitis?\n\nI smoke on the reg and do not see a correlation except maybe for when I am high I am more likely to eat shit food.\n \n&gt;6.\t\u2060Do you have sensitive skin in general?\n\nI definitely do. I am have a long facial care routine. lotion every day, sunscreen, masks, the whole nine. \n\n&gt;Thank you for your time, I have also posted on this sub but am always looking for new experiences and information.\n\nNo problem, always happy to help.

I keep an incognito account. Everyone is welcome from what i know Hi. I was diagnosed with CCCA when I was 12. I am now 25. How are you managing it? I was prescribed doxycycline on and off, along with derma-smoothe, ketaconazole shampoo for the first few years. Pretty much got tired of taking the oral antibiotics bc after a while they hurt my stomach and I got tired of the yeast infections. I took a more holistic approach when it went into remission, MSM, Curamed, Hair Vitamins, Scalp massages twice a day, the inverted method. Last month was the first time I went to the dermatologist because that is the worst it is ever been. Back in November I got a flu shot and a yellow fever shot and it really did a number on me. I think one or both of those triggered it again but a different type of symptom. My scalp was itchy all over but I never actually looked at it until before I left to go to ghana. I could not get an appointment at the dermatologist bc they take 3 months in philly. I was forced to buy doxycycline from Ghana which was like $3 \ud83d\ude02. When I finally returned I was able to take my braids out and noticed me scalp was red and all of the skin around the follicles looked white all over my entire head. It scared me bc my alopecia was only in the center of my head and yes it did spread but cicitricial alopecia is not supposed to affect the back back of the hair. I thought it was dandruff but no. The current derm does not seem to know much about my problem (he thought I diagnosed myself even though I told him I was professionally diagnosed) but I made him give me the same stuff I used when I was younger. I have clobetasol propianate gel, I told him I had acne (I do not) but clindamycin can be used on the scalp too. I really do not like ketaconazole shampoo bc I am black and it makes my hair hair and crunchy even if I only put it on the scalp. Honestly this shit sucks but I have learned to live with it.

I have been lurking in this subreddit quite a bit so I decided to introduce myself and give my 2 cents about the condition. I am a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with Follilulitis Decalvans several months ago, but started experiencing symptoms over a year ago. My case appears to a mild form of FD, as I initially only got small pimples on the top of my head, then later got many more on the back of my head, and a few on the front of my scalp. It does not appear to look like other \"severe\" forms of FD - where people seem to have gigantic cysts/crusty acne on almost every spot on their head, so I am blessed for that. But then again, we may have caught it early, and prevented it from spreading around my entire head. Nonetheless, It was extremely painful to sleep on, and made me appear somewhat ugly (at least from my perspective, most people around me said they did not even notice it when I asked them about it.) \n\nSo, immediately after the acne flared up on my scalp, I went to a doctor and was prescribed a basic antibiotic (I do not remember the brand), which did very little, or maybe nothing at all, to calm the break out. The doctor recommended that I set up an appointment with a Dermatologist. So I did, and by chance, the Dermatologist that I met with happened to be a doctor that has a lot of experience with treating facial acne, and prescribes Accutane/Isotretinoin liberally. I was put on a smaller dosage of Isotretinoin (cannot remember the amount exactly) but it totally worked. Within a few weeks, the breakouts/pimples/scabs were completely gone, except for maybe a tiny pimple or two. \n\nSo after a few months the dosage was raised to 40mg of Isotretinoin twice daily. Which has completely cleaned up my scalp even further, and the few tiny bald spots are pure white now; not even reddish/pinkish like they were before the treatment.\n\nBecause of the Covid-19 pandemic, I am unable to visit my Dermatologist. So recently I had a video call with him, he assessed my condition and noted the effectiveness of the Isotrenoin. During the call, we discussed other methods to combat FD, such as laser hair removal (I informed him that I have no issue with being bald, as long as the pain/discomfort goes away), as well as other treatments that we could try, which he did not name. I assume he was talking about antibiotics such as rifampin, minocycline &amp; clindamycin, etc. We also discussed whether or not the FD would return, as it is possible that I may have had some sort of mild case of acne. Or, if the FD will return but only in a milder form. He also mentioned that he has never treated a patent with FD before, and that he recommends I get a second opinion from a hair loss specialist/someone who has experience with treating FD. At any rate, he prescribed me one month more of Isotrenoin (40mg, twice daily.) Once I run out of Isotrenoin, somewhere around July, I will see him again, probably in person, and I will go off the Isotrenoin for a while to see if the disease returns or not (which I assume it probably will.)\n\nWhere I am now: I have been doing a lot of research on this condition, and obviously there does not seem to be a permanent cure for FD. I am sort of confused on what my next step will be when I get off the Isotrenoin - should the flare ups return. Since evidently the Isotrenoin is extremely effective in combating the flare ups in my case, do I just have to stay on it forever? Is that even possible? I do not know. The only way out of this that I can think of, is if I go through some sort of laser hair removal to permanently remove the hair follicles on my head, which would prevent the constant flare ups. I would be perfectly willing to go through with this, I would have absolutely no issue spending the money on laser hair removal and enduring the pain of the laser on my head, as long as I am able to find a laser hair removal specialist that can operate on the scalp. I have contacted several laser hair removal companies, but they do not offer scalp hair removal as the scalp is too \"sensitive.\" \n\nAnyways, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate that a community like this exists for FD/Scarring  Alopecia sufferers. I have learned a lot of important information from this subreddit. I look forward to interacting with you all in the future and hope that we can get through this horrible affliction, that we all share, together. Thanks for your story.. would you mind trying to give information regarding the points raised in this post? \n\nI am hoping finding the cause might help to find the solution\n.. I was diagnosed back in 2014 but I know I had it since 2013.  I had the gigantic crusty cyst kind and it was very painful.  Isotretinoin was very effective for me and I believe it is was caused my FD to lower in intensity to the level that it is right now which is bearable.  I encourage you to try and keep it contained and hopefully the intensity lowers for you as well. I have a very similar story, i am also diagnosed recently although i think i had a very mild case for more than a year as my bar er used to tell me there seem to be red skin in the back of my head. A year later flares and lack of sleep etc...\n\n\nMy doctors started with topical solutions,, useless. Now i am on rimpacine and clindamicine twice daily.\n\nI do not mind removing my hair of it would prevent the fd. I prefer loosing my hair rather than having antibiotics or isotretinoin for my entire life. I asked my doctors for isotretinoin as some papers showed very long term remission but they said no.\n\nAs for the laser hair removal i have a brownish reddish hair and from my research I think only black or dark brown hair can be removed by laser.\n\nI do not know what to do to be honest. I currently have very minor symptoms as i am still on antibiotics but from what i read, chances are i will have this again. Welcome! I would personally hold off on laser hair removal as there is not concrete evidence that would result in permanent remission. I was diagnosed with FD a decade ago and still have most of my hair due to a variety of treatments. The longest was Rifampin/Clindamycin for a few years, but I think my two courses of Isotretinoin are what permanently moderated the disease to it is current manageable level. \n\nI am not a doctor, but I would see how the condition responds after this Isotretinoin course and go from there. You might get lucky and achieve remission. Doxycycline is typically the first tier of systemic treatment after topicals fail, followed by Rifampin/Clindamycin dual therapy and then Isotretinoin. \n\nI also recommend going to the CARF website found on the subreddit side bar and using their physician resource to find a doctor near you with FD experience. I have two great doctors in my state, both are at universities. \n\nGood luck and keep us posted! I had a similar experience after a 10 month course of Isotretinoin, 80mg a day. My FD is relatively mild now compared to before the treatment. I am considering long term low dose acitretin to see if that knocks it out. How long ago was the  Isotretinoin treatment? My last Isotretinoin treatment was probably 6 or 7 years ago now. That was the ten month 80mg daily course. Since then I have mostly been on antibiotics with some periods of no medicine but it is only mildly active now. Prior to Isotretinoin and my long Rifampin/Clindamycin course I would have characterized it as very active with bleeding/pustules. Do you believe diet can help reduce inflammation, or is diet largely irrelevant - as the disease may simply be the result of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria and/or a genetic predisposition to it? Any updates ? It is been about a month since I went off Accutane and my head is still clear... For now. Who knows how long my remission will last for. From what I have read diet does seem to help. I tried Whole 30 and did not notice much but I may need a more sustained period of dieting. How is your scalp doing? Have been off Accutane for about a month. The FD hasnt returned (yet, knock on wood.) Im hoping that like others have said, if it does come back, the Accutane will have made the FD at least somewhat less \"severe.\" Yeah I took iso for 10 days and was clear for a month.

I m a 23 male, never had any issues with my skin before, only my keratosis pyliaris that came with my genetics.\nEverything stared about a year ago, when I started to notice some wired red spots on my chest, and I had itchy scalp too.Went straight to the dermatologist and she told me that I have a fungus that grow on to my scalp and that caused the red spots. The doctor gave me a shampoo \u201cMediket Versi\u201d,magnesium and Lomexin(cream) to put straight on my spots. After 2 weeks the spots were gone but the bumps on my scalp kept getting bigger, but nothing alarming, i texted the doctor and she told me to change my shampoo to this new one named \u201cMedikit intagmo\u201d, did not work. The bumps started to get bigger, red,itchy and began to hurt.\nI went to another appointment, beacuse in the mean time I got a nasty smell commming from inside of my nose when I exhaled,and this time I had another treatment (biomicine,Vichy Dercos Shampoo,some eye drops for the nose thing,and a solution that I had to appy after I washed my hair) this keept it under control. After I finished this treatment,2 weeks later it was BAD, the infection spreaded and the pain was unbearabl, felt like a hot niddle stabbing my scalp,pus came in and it was a lot.\nI m on my 3rd treatment atm(azitromice, a probiotic zir-fos,epiduo a gel like cream to apply on the pustules,lactiferom and the same vichy dercos shampoo),this is the second day of the treatment and i do not see any changes.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I did not do any blood or microbial tests,I was just diagnosed with folliculitis declavans because the doctor told it looks like it.\nI have 2 small bald spots all ready.\nAsking for help and some answers.\nWill my hair fall out? All of it?\nHow fast I should see some improvements beeing on antbiotic ?\nIf a pustule pops and pus comes out how to properly clean the area so it does not spread?If it pops should I squeeze it until i see blood coming out?\nWhat is the BP shampoo and how to use it?\nDoes diet affect this condition?\nPLEASE HELP, andthank you for your time. If truly what to know a scalp biopsy is the way, if current treatments are not help talk to ur doc about accutane", "Just venting and asking for an opinion on my dermatologist Hi everyone\n\nI  have acne for about 5 years, since I was 19. That is when I first  noticed bald patches in my beard (about 0.5-1cm in diameter). The hair  grew back each time after a few months so it did not really bother me.  However, over time the acne started to show on my chest, pubic hair and  now my scalp. The acne on my chest are growing slowly and occasionaly  turn into cysts. I started going to a few doctors in 2018 when I also  noticed a swollen lymph gland between my chin and neck. They put me on  azithromycin since the swabs were positive for a Staph. It helped for  about 4-6 months, then everything came back.\n\nI  noticed two bald patches in my scalp for the first time a few weeks  ago. On one of them the hair is back and here is a link to the second one  (\n\nMy  dermatologist (on whom I ask for an opinion) said it is Folliculitis  with Perifolliculitis (he just nodded when I said about Folliculitis  Decalvans and said, yea, that is it) and put me on Minocycline for two  weeks even tho the acne swab from my chin came back negative. Also to  use topical Clyndamicine. During these two weeks I had several  flare-ups, particularly one on my chest (two cysts connected into one)  possibly from the high stress and anxiety this diagnose is causing me  and the others were minor ones in my chin, chest and neck. The cysts on  my chest did resemble Hidradenitis Suppurativa, but two derms and a  family doctor said it is probably not since I do not have them on a  typical spot, so I guess I will bother with it later.\n\nAfter  finishing the two weeks on Minocycline I went to his office today. He  looked at me, said i should stop taking the Minocycline even though I  asked that people seem to take it for longer periods (several months).  He said I should do an extensive blood test (lipids, triglycerids) so if  everything is okay, I will be put on a long therapy with Accutane  (Isotretinoin).\n\nI am scared of  Accutane. I have maybe one cyst-like acne in any given moment (mostly on  chest or face) and the rest are smaller acne with redness, the scalp  remained the same in more than a month. I should definitely take this  seriously and I am, a lot changed in my diet and use of topicals and  shampoos. However, I do believe that this is a mild case for now. That  is why I am asking for your opinion, primarily on the shortness of the  Minocycline therapy, and how fast it was switched to Accutane.  I plan  on changing the derm and not rushing with Accutane because I am scared of  the side effects. Any opinion on this matter will be much appreciated. Just take the accutane man. It will be best.", "Does this seem like scarring alopecia?  I normally wear wigs but recently (past 4 months), I lost tons of hair here and have had constant burning so I did braids and left this area alone. However I still got these red spots. I went to the doc about this before and they keep saying traction alopecia upon looking at my scalp, but that does not explain the burning or location of it, as I usually wear a wig", "Investigation of the causes of Scarring Alopecia Hi all,\n\nI have been suffering from this condition for 7-8 years now and other than my continuous search for treatment (personally use **Ionil** Shampoo to clean the scabs away and then disinfect with **Chlorhexidine** or antibiotic cream if very infected); I thought it would also be interesting to investigate the cause.\n\nOne of the aspects I am considering investigatng is **hair/scalp products** you used in the years preceding the start of your problem. Here are the ones I was most accustomed to using: \n\nShampoo: ( most of my teenage years; ( in months prior to initial symptoms appearing\n\nGel: ( most of my teenage years; no gel in months prior to initial symptoms. \n\nI noticed at the time that most of those products contained  **Methylisothiazolinone;**  a substance declared the *2013 Contact Allergen of the Year* by the American Contact Dermatitis Society; and initially associated the issue to this as it was diagnosed as dermatitis. \n\n**Hair type**: Wavy/frizzly and thick (prior to initial symptoms), thin now. \n\nAnother aspect I thought would be interesting to discuss would be the **personal situation** **and changes** you were experiencing when the symptoms appeared. Here are mine: \n\n**Relationship**: Re-uniting with my girlfriend after a stressful year apart of long distance relationship and degraded sleeping as a result. \n\n**Work/study**: Recently graduated, starting first job (stress). \n\n**Habits**: Recently quit smoking both cigarettes and weed prior to symptoms appearing. \n\nIf those of you that have the time to comment on those factors could do so; I would be prepared to compile the data so that we can try and analyse it. My dermatologist has recently recomended a product that would make all my skin peel away and possibly damage my liver; I am hoping for some other solution but slowly giving in to the idea with every renewed flare up.. A lot of your situation is very similar to mine. As someone who is gone down the medication route, none of them were effective. And accutane can be legitimately dangerous and hard on your body.\n\n\nI would recommend avoiding more medication, from my experience. I tried many different ones and they all caused me some side effects one way or another. My FD began around Junior year of highschool. Prior to that, I had pilonidal cyst surgery, had cuts on my scalp from shaving it once at a party, and had bad seasonal allergies and asthma. I have taken daily Claritin for years. *Regarding hair type:* I do indeed have EXTREMELY frizzy/wavy and dry hair (I am sorry if this offends anyone, but people have always referred to my type of hair as a \"Jew Fro.\")\n\n*Relationship status at time of FD emergence:* I have never been in a relationship. So that is not what caused my flare up.\n\n*Work:* I was working part time (few hours a week) at a family business, was a bit stressed out thinking about what I wanted to do with my life. But nothing too serious.\n\n*Habits:* I ate horribly, was drinking/smoking cigs/vaping nicotine/smoking weed with friends quite a bit.\n\n*Physical changes:* I have mostly stayed the same weight, fluctuating between gaining and losing 5-10 pounds every year or so.\n\nOne thing I **CAN** say for sure about the circumstances before the emergence of my FD, was that I was planning on getting dreadlocks at the time. So I was growing my hair out, **and was NOT washing it regularly** (which is a part of getting dreadlocks. You are not supposed to wash your hair with shampoo or conditioner, only occasionally running water through it.) I remember one day in the shower running water through my hair, **and feeling a tiny little bald spot on the front of my scalp.** I did not think much of it. At any rate, because of my hair being so thick, I got sick of growing it out for dreadlocks and decided to shave it all off. **I shaved it HARD with a buzzer and REALLY cut the heck out of my scalp, on several spots**. I remember having blood running down my back and stinging like crazy when I put my head under the shower head. **I believe they healed fine, and THEN a few months later, the emergence of FD started.**\n\nSo to summarize: I think in some ways, the cause of my condition may have been from the **neglect of my scalp for months** due to my attempt to get dreadlocks, **and also the horrible eating/smoking/drinking habits,** as well as the **severe cuts I sustained from carelessly shaving my head.** This is the best I can come up with. Personally I think the disease is genetic related, and all of those things I mentioned may have just **accelerated** the condition.", "Clindamicine rifampin side effects I guess most of the people here went through the systematic treatment of clindamicine rifampin combination.\n\nI have been on them for the past ~month. I am curious what side effects did you experience especially from long term exposure to those antibiotics.\n\nI am currently having  moderate diarrhea. But recently i am feeling Tinnitus in my ear. Wondering if anyone experienced hearing loss or other long term side effects due to this regime. I have been more thirsty/dehydrated feeling. Also, I feel like I have the flu every day(mild though). Taking pre and probiotics helps. I have always had tinnitus, so I cannot tell if it is worsened. I will keep you posted. I am a month in also. My biggest side effect was requiring larger and larger doses to achieve a clear scalp. I definitely was building a resistance to the antibiotics. I started looking for more sustainable solutions. I was prescribed topical clindamycin for breakouts and later dapsone which is an anti-inflammatory cream. Have you tried Isotretinoin? From what I read, it seems more effective, although i never had it. Yeah, so I actually was on the antibiotics and then I started isotretinoin (Accutane). Accutane worked much better for me than any of the previous antibiotic regiments. I did have a slew of different side effects from that: constant dryness, joint pain, and worst of all, liver damage. Accutane is not benign. For some people, it can also cause mental health issues, so pick your poison. I did notice that after accutane, my flare ups would never be as bad. They could be managed with more conservative measures such as weight-loss, shorter hair, routinely changing out pillow cases, and topical dapsone/clindamycin for bad flareups. Not any side effects besides my IBS that got worse. Also, that shit helped two-three months max. If it is a long term solution for you, you will have won the lottery.", "Can a Person with Stable SA Still Get a Hair Transplant? Is it possible that a person suffering with SA can have a hair transplant if the SA condition has been stable over many years? For example, lets say a person who has had SA for 5 years has not lost any hair. Would he still be able to get approval for a hair transplant? From what I have read, yes. It is usually up to the surgeon. Some will do the surgery--some will not touch it. I am thinking about SMP to just get it over and done with. That has it is downsudes also. Hopefully we find new therapies soon. Oh so youre in the same boat as me. You have stable SA where very little hair is shedding or none at all. Since that is the case why then dont you go for a hair transplant? No, I am not stable yet. Still on Dapsone and it still itches and burns...and hurts. A hair transplant is still kind of risky because it could wake things up again--and you could also lose all the hair again from a flare up. This is an insidious affliction. Basically anything you do to try and combat it--it throws back a huge down side. I just meant that SMP might be the way to go once things quiet down. But even SMP causes trauma to the scalp and could make it all flare up again (after it is been quiet). I did not ask--what type do you have? I have Folliculitis Decalvans. Yes I have to be aware of that. I will leave it up to the derm to see what he decides. i just cant go on for years with this mess. I feel imprisoned by my own stupid health issues Yes unfortunately youre right. Its very sad. The derm told me eventually after some time SA will burn out. I am still waiting and no research has helped so far. Yes, I have heard the same. I hope burn out is soon. For all of us. Dr Donovan, a derm in Canada, has a lot of good info.\n\nDonovanmedical.com I feel you. Same here. It is affected so many things and trying not to let it. Dating and even pursuing other jobs. \n\nWhat type? Decalvans?  Appreciate the link but a doctor I talked to today reassured me that a patient showing progress albeit still afflicted with SA can still be considered to be a candidate for a hair transplant. It just depends on the progress and level of SA. In my case this is very encouraging news which I am sure others in my situation will feel relieved and hopeful. Very good question. My derm never informed me what specifically I have/had. But based on images I googled I can tell you confidently I dont have folliculitis decalvans. Its never that advanced.\n\nI just have pinkish patches, and theyre not even pink anymore. The patches are actually turning normal white slowly but surely coupled with no burning sensation that I used to feel uncomfortably with years ago. No itching, burning and the pink is almost gone from existence. I wonder if PRP injected into the scalp can reverse or at least greatly improve the SA itself. That Is a question I will post on the forum. Yeah feeling is mutual. As for folliculitis decalvans, I answered that question here somewhere on this thread. I would follow dr donovans guidance as he is one of the foremost physicians on the topic. Most physicians dont know jack about SA. I woudnt say they dont know shit about SA but I would say they dont know how to treat it effectively. \n\nI will check out dr donovan. But I am sure he wont treat any more differently than any other derm. There will be a lot for you to read and learn. Are you taking any meds currently to have put it in remission? How long and what did it take you? Hi there. I have had steroid injections, pills and topical solutions. They didnt work, as a matter of fact they made the condition worse. I can tell you that sunlight really helped even though its not recommended. Interesting, thanks for sharing, what did work for you to get it under control? How long did it take? I got the lpp diagnosis recently myself which sounds like it is what you have and was prescribed doxy, injections every month, and topical steroids. So far i do feel like its been worse...sunshine + salt water always used to work for my seborrheic dermatitis like pretty much a cure so i wonder if that would help with this. Yeah i stopped the stupid injections, topicals and pills. Switched from topical to tropical.. lol.. translation, sun. \n\nI dont know what llp is so i cant comment on it. My condition has greatly improved from the pinkness, bug crawling sensation and itchiness. When I scratch my head to test I hardly feel any sensation. Not in the clear yet but almost am! When I shampoo I dont see any hairs in the drain. \n\nSome time ago a hair transplant doc told me that if my condition becomes stable he can give me a hair transplant. I am at that stage now. \n\nWhat Is helped me more than the stupid meds was sun. I would stay exposed under the sun during summers - except for winter when the sun is fleeting and weak. But theres another element that is greatly helping me and is the one element that people ignorantly overlook... faith. How do you make do during the winters? It is really dark during the winter months where i live unfortunately. Do you let sun head your hair/head or just sit in the sun all around? And Lpp = lichen planopilaris...that what it sounds like you may have based on what you describe. Have you changed your diet at all? I have seborrheic dermatitis and diet was always big with me for managing that. Also, heads up that a hair transplant can also awaken the disease as that has been documented quite a bit, so you may want a couple plan Bs for what you would do to manage. Good question. In the winters here where I am at I cant get any sun cuz its so cold. When the sun is strong in other seasons I usually sun bathe. Yeah I dont know what llp is. So like I said I cant comment. Thanks for sharing, well, glad the summertime sun has stabilized you. Will look forward to that. Doesnt get sunny here til may or june unfortunately. Need to move south. Just wait... time flies Want to keep my hair in the meantime : ( need to lessen the inflammation Very good", "New Study On Decalvans Using PDT Hello guys,  \nI stumbled upon this study today:\n\n(\n\nUnlike previous PDT, researchers here used a systematic  photosensitizer Interesting! Thanks for posting! Interesting", "I just want your opinions...I will do a biopsy next week, things are slow with the crysis. They put me on Minocycline without any tests, my acne swab from the chin turned out negative and I am severely limiting dairy and gluten but not completely...I just need opinion on the texture(?) od this spot?  A dermathologiat and my family doctor already said they think it is Folliculitis Decalvans, I have it in my beard and my chest, but my derm said he thinks that I have Hidradenitis Suppurlativa bqsed on the photos in the chest, that is...possibly Not sure why your doctor decided to go with systematic antibiotics before the biopsy result. However going with the biopsy is a good idea. Many doctors i have been to procrastinated the biopsy which wasted me unnecessary time and treatment.\n\nI believe no one but a dermatologist can diagnose you. This is not the right place for a diagnosis. I hope you get negative results for FD or any SA. I can also suggest that you do not over google things at this stage because you do not need to stress about it.\n\nBe confident that in case you unfortunately have FD that it is a treatable problem and that there are many things that will improve your condition to a point you do not worry about it I would find a hair loss specialist derm...a competent derm will be able to diagnose you without taking a biopsy.", "Gluten free diet: An option for people with folliculitis decalvans Hello guys,\n\nIm a student from Brazil and since i started college i have been developing  folliculitis decalvans. I tried, like you, a lot of different treatments, had done all of the exams and all i know its an infection by staphylococcus aureus. I had it for years but recently i jonned an intership that had cause me a lot of stress and, with that, i gain a lot of weight   and the condition got worse. Severely worse. So i lost weight and manage to get control of it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, since i was a kit, had little inflamations on my skin on my arms, my elbow and my legs. they look like acne  but its all over the body. me and all of the doctors i have been to (total of 7 diferrent doctors) never thought that it was related. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a friend of mine was tested for celiac disease. she had this little inflamations too, not scaring allopecia but little rash on the skin just like me. and since she started her treatmente the rashes had dissapeared. So i had decided to try it out a glutten free diet for a month. Just to see what happens. And for my surprise the rashes are dissapering, and they are going away fast. Today its my fifth day of the diet and my skin its much better. And For my surprise the scarring allopecia seems to be responding too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm not saying its a cure, Im just saying that it seems to be working FOR ME, and working better than any other treatment that i did with the doctors. \n\nI have researched its mechanism of action and i found a very good video that im leaving it here.\n\n( This is actually interesting! I have been doing some personal research on scientific papers, support groups etc..\n\nThere seem to be an under research area which is the impact of diet and gut microbs and skin microbs on autoimmune conditions. Although there seem to be some contradictions here and there but the approach is sound and there seem to be a relationship between all of that!\n\nIn theory, aiming towards a lower overall inflammation in the body would definitely benefit the condition \"at least in theory\" the question would be to which extend. \n\nI am trying to stay away from antibiotics for my current treatment as i am interested in trying to enhance my gut and skin bacteria cultures. Along with diet tweaks sunch as cutting down on sugar inflammatory foods smoking and perhaps gluten. I am curious how my body would react to this but it should help. I went gluten free last year for 6 months to try this theory out and it worked!! My scalp looked so healthy and no more itching.  And then the pandemic started and I fell off it. So...I need to get back on it. But I do not know if I want to do that because it can skew with results when I start Humira. I will ask my dermatologist what he thinks. How was the fight to get on Humira? My dermatologist said it would be difficult  for me at the moment. This happened just recently that we decided I would go on Humira so we are in the very beginnings of dealing with insurance. I will let you know what happens. I plan on making a master post and updating it as I go along..if I get approved. My derm said that since I have failed at all the normal safe options that we are going into experimental meds now and hopefully insurance sees everything I have tried and failed at. That makes sense. I hope you get relief soon. Cannot wait for the update. Best wishes.", "It use to be the small patch, now it is a formed a new bigger one. The stress is killing me  I have scarring alopecia but it is no longer \u201cactive\u201d, and I did get the shots. What has your dermatologist said? Two things that worked for me: clindamycin topical treatment and diet.  The clindamycin stopped the initial scarring, reversed balding, and now I do not even need it.  I cut out gluten, sugar, lowered my carb intake and now I rarely get flare ups and when I do they are minor.\n\nStress will make things worse.  You need to get on top of it and get proactive about looking at diet and potential treatments.  You will eventually find what works for you but it is going to take some trial and error and a willingness to experiment.\n\nI have been where you are.  I was freaking out too.  But things worked out.  They will for you as well. Seeing the derm in 4 weeks. Anything I can say ? Or should say ? I would ask if he can figure out if it is still active (I guess it is if you are saying it is getting bigger). Also just to lyk what mine did, I got the steroid shots once a month for a while and was also put on doxycycline (idk if that helped it but it made my skin really clear lol)\u2014 I know for some people doxy can make hair fall out so it depends, and also I think they are antibiotics so def not meant for long term. And I started looking for natural things too, I got Jamaican black castor oil from tropic isle living and that is definitely thickened up the hair I have so the bald spots are not as noticeable (I have quite a few large patches but no one can tell bc the rest of my hair is long/ fairly thick now). Also I think the derm gave me rogaine and some sort of eye drops meant to be put on the bald spots lol but I never really used those. The shots and antibiotics were at the idea of this $900 copay dermatologist I went to see once in the city, and my regular derm was able to give me the shots so I did not have to travel every time. Just some ideas but talk to yours and see if any of these might work!", "Diet I recently discovered the Ketogenic diet from watching Ted Talk and The Joe Rogan Podcast.  I have been suffering from Folliculitis Dacalvans since 2013 and I am currently on antibiotics which help for some time.

Changing my diet seemed to solve my FD. It is completely gone, and I am guessing that it was due to some kind intolerance to dairy products (have not been tested yet for lactose intolerance yet).\n\nNowadays I am mostly a vegetarian, shop at farmers' markets and avoid processed foods.

I started of with itchy scabs, which I could not help but pick and itch (probably not a wise thing to do). One day I consulted a pharmacist friend, he suggested it may be a fungal infection and to try a shampoo called Nizoral and a Hydrocortisone cream called Daktacort. I have also spoke to my doctor and he suggested Mometasone (steroid cream).\n\nI have since been using these 3 products and have been using and anti-bacterial soap (Dettol), not daily as I fear it could be harsh on the rest of my hair.

I have been suffering with folliculitis for a few years now. I believe I have decalvans. I have taken antibiotics which worked but quickly came back after stopping. I am going to speak to a doctor to hopefully get referred to a specialist to help. I have afew round bald patches mostly around my scalp and a few towards the front of my hair. \nI have seen several images that seem to be way more severe than mine with more hair loss in a shorter period of time which gives me hope it could be treated. Does anyone have any recommendations for treatment to maybe bring up with a doctor? Or any tips at all to ease scarring to possibly reduce hairloss? Also is hairloss reversible because 50% of my patches tend to have Patches of hair growing out from them? \n\nThanks guys, alot of unstructured words but I hope it reads okay hey man I too am suffering from this condition. At least, I think so. You can take a look yourself by visiting my post in my profile but ive seen some hair regrowth and honestly I am not sure what it could be. At first it was a single, noticable bald spot but it grew and some other smaller ones appeared. I read on a thread that using benzoyl peroxide (currently using neutrogena brand in the shower every two days) can help get rid of the bumps. It was true but mine went away very slowly, not as quickly as when I used the doxycycline that was prescribed to me.\n\nThis hair loss really has taken an emotional and psychological toll on my life but experimenting with cool hats helps me a little. My derm appointment is not for another month and I hope that when I go, I can ask for an isotretinoin prescription, as I have seen a couple of cases of amazing recoveries from fd using this antibiotic.( that have been treated successfully with isotretinoin (accutane) antibiotics. I asked the author for updated images and the bald spots have grown back almost completely. Now, I do not want to give you false hope, as I too expect this to happen knowing it could possibly fail, but I would like to let you know you are not alone and I am here if you would like some updates and emotional support. Thanks for your reply! Reading up on this it appears this is a way more extreme case than mine? My spots have never been painful and bleeding and such? I am really confused with what I have here because I can relate to his spots only on a small level? Mine only appear to be in the same crown area  which is really focused? I am going to book an appointment with a specialist and see what they say! I also have hair growing out of the ones on the crown? Just want this to go haha best of luck to you! hopefully scars have not taken up your spots like some of mine might have so restoration can be possible! I am already working towards a hair transplant if possible because of my attachment to my locks was insane.\nLet me know how things go please, I really would like to see many others' experiences with this shitty and tricky to treat disease. Ofcourse man! I think I might be lucky in that some have not scared but I am going to keep.on top.of it! Do you think the hair falls out due to picking or just naturally, because I tend to always pick the spots. I notice I can sometimes pull out chunks of weakened hair out which is probably not helping at all yeah I tend to do the pulling and plucking a lot which makes me panic a bit so I let it fall on its own in the shower or under my hats to not aggravate it. I read that vitamin d supplements could help your follicles hang on to your hair and support the immune system your body has failed through this disease. I cannot guarantee that any of my methods work or that the hair I am regrowing will stay but this is just some info I researched.\nThe hairs likely fall on their own as well since folliculitis Decalvans attacks the follicles mistakenly and then proceeds to scar. Hopefully your specialist will see you soon enough for you to regain your lost strands and restore your mental stability. In the meantime, try not to pull too much or to aggravate it by scratching especially since more bacteria from your nails can transfer into the infections and lesions. I have also noticed little to no new spots since completely cutting out shampoo from my routine. Have you noticed this? well, I still use shampoo just Ketoconazol shampoo and apple cider vinegar infused shampoo I am not sure what it could be. I use the Aveeno asv shampoo Maybe try without? I would have several spots every day using shampoo, since cutting it out I have noticed maybe 3 or 4 which have not led to any hairlos I got decalvans, diagnosed with a biopsy. So probably correct diagnosis.\nMy problem was the pain more than hair loss. I literally was looking into laser may hair off as a way to stop the pain.\n\nAs for baldness,  ironically was not big patches, just patchy hair loss here and there ( also sides,  which seems rare actually never seen this on the internet usually crown area) but i lost a lot of hair.\n\n\nIsotretinoin tuned it down. Not remission,  but i can live with it like this. I hope i do not relapse afterwards as I am still on it. My dermatologist decided to go on a low dose long term approach (a bit less than a year). Which i was sceptical about as  normally this is prescribed with a higher dosage like 0.5 per kg . I am on 20mg daily (im 75 kg) since last summer. It took a long time to kick in like 4 month. But it helped eventually.\n\nNone of us here seem to be a doctor including me, but i would suggest you discuss this with your doctor. I was put on antibiotics at first, i had to look hard for a dermatologist that would agree to put me on this instead of antibiotics as it seems hopeless from what I read. Apparently doctors here are more conservative with Isotretinoin but it is understandable as it is a shitty medicine. Hey man, I have not seemed to have any pain? How much spots did you tend to have at one point? my hair gets intensely oily if I do not use it and I think the oils are what cause the folliculitis. Excess sebum and clogged follicles leads to w\nthe little whiteheads Hey /u/PhoenixHntr, how is your scalp doing lately? Still on Accutane? Hey!!\nI finished my course few weeks ago i took isotretinoin for a whole year. Doses between 20 mg and final month on 10 mg. With erythromycin (topical) as an adjacent treatment (which i do not find useful)\n\nI still have active decalvans but over all it is much better. I can live normally now. However i did notice some relapse after i stopped and still worried about it. I had a short episode of itchiness but now it calmed down again. I hope i do not go back to where things were\n\nI think isotretinoin helped stopped the formation on  pustules and sort of tuned it down. I still get few but rarely.\n\nDoctor suggested that i can try another course next winter but if things remained like this i prefer not to as the side effects were exhausting.\n\nAlso i tried different hair style to manage the baldness but i do not have a very bad situation on that aspect and my hair is afro so it covers okish\n\nI also use tea tree oil and apple vinegar (diluted) on bad days. They seem to help.", "Prp shots a possible treatment? Hey you all, was wondering if anyone here has had any experience with prp shots with scarring alopecia? Particularly folliculitis decalvans, fellow sufferer here haha. I do not want to sound optimistic but I feel that within the next few years it could be possible that there will be a cure. It has shown promise in the few cases I have seen in medical journals. Below is a recent article that presents two patients who experienced quick but temporary symptom improvement following PRP. It can be cost prohibitive however.\n\n I have read that before, do you think it is  something that derms or those in research are paying close attention to it as a new option perhaps? Also, want to say thank you for the research and time that you put into these articles and information for us. Much appreciated. I personally have had a dermatologist recommended PRP treatment to me, but I declined due to cost and the monthly frequency. However it may be a good option for others. \n\nThank you! I started this community about 9 years ago, in part selfishly so that I could crowdsource treatment ideas but even more importantly to connect with others with rare scalp conditions and to learn their stories. I am glad the community continues to grow and be active. Yeah I am considering it for folliculitis decalvans, and also cause I am thinning in areas around my head so I want to get in quick before it is too late haha, currently taking 10mg isotretinoin after a long break where I thought I had beat it but sadly it came back so hopefully this time it burns out. Glad to see how big this community is. If somehow we can make a lot of noise for scarring alopecia related diseases, then maybe serious work will be taken into it.

I just joined the sub. and wanted to start with a little discution here:\n\nI have FD for 3 now and, like the mod have done for some time, I have searching for news about novel treateaments and an eventual cure.During my research, I realised that studies about scarring alopecia are becoming more and more frequent (which is great for us!). \n\n\n\nFor curiosity, I analysed this sub as well and... Same thing!

Maybe (s)he can show it to other SA sufferers. Who knows how many are out there?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course there are other variables that can influence to that (cost to conduct a study, better technology, etc), however, It is a area that seem to be neglected for so long and now started to be explored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also would like to say that this sub is great! There are a few organizations who are focused in helping people struggling alopecia (most of you may know they. Will talk about it in another post), but a group where we are can communicate directely to each other is extremely important. We can use this space to empower our community and become the main protagonists for the understanding of the diseases! (I will share my ideas in another post) I was thinking the same thing a few weeks ago. \n\n\"Is scarring alopecia becoming more frequent worldwide? Is it partly covid related? Something environmental? Induced by severe stress?\"\n\nHumans seem to be taking on a new level of stress lately. \n\nMaybe it is just that its being properly diagnosed now--so the numbers are going up. It still seems to be the rarity though... That is true.\n\nAbout the COVID topic, it can be directly as well as indirect involved (stress caused by lockdown/home office/DE...) I have also noticed in the last couple years of quite a few people complaining about \"male pattern itch\". In another forum.\n\nThis group believed that DHT was attacking the follicles and causing the itch. I mean.. maybe... but I have not seen a study on that.They complained of severe itch, shedding, and thin spots. People on this certain forum would say \"get on minoxidal and Propecia\". \n\nNow I believe that most of those complaints could have been scarring alopecia symptoms. Just was not diagnosed correctly. For me, it was believed to be sebhorric dermatitis for years before FD diagnosis.\n\nOf course this does not address why females are hit hard with this...", "Any tips for pain relief?

Even my dermatologist did not know much about the condition and just googled searched it with me when I got diagnosed about 5-6 years ago.

I had previously been told that I had neurodermitis and dermatitis by other dermatolgists so this was big news for me.\n\nAfter being treated with the usual clyndamicin plus rifampicin, there was not all that much improvement which he said was puzzling as most of his patients with fd responded well to it.\n'Experiments' followed throughout the following year (isotretinoin, cyclosporin, cortisone, other antibiotics) which also offered limited success. Isotretinoin was particularly brutal with its side effects. Basically I had reached an all time low as it seemed that nothing was working and the scarring was spreading. Swallowing so many pills over that period of time really wore me down.\n\nThrough family connection and online research we stumbled across more specialised dermatologists who had done research in the fd field and paid them a visit as a last hope in order to get a second opinion on my situation. \nOnce there, the expert on scalp conditions quickly deciphered that I did not have FD but Keratosis Folliculitis spinolosa decalvans. \nMuch rarer and less documented than FD. \n\nYay. \n\nSo im now on new medication (dapsone) and am taking a lower amount than previously with practically no side effects and at least have the feeling that it is all going somewhere. \nSeeing improvements  in the 1.5 months since then but that might just be down to the fact that it is summer.\n\nNot really sure if this could be of any help to you guys, I just wanted to share my story and make you guys aware that if you are not responding to the usual treatments you could have a variation of the disease.

But the goal of using minoxidil is to stimulate whatever may be surviving in hopes that it can regrow. I find that the drug has been giving me headaches but it is bearable. I am curious if others have had this experience. Also, when you go off minoxidil (which I hope to do in a few months) did your re-grown hair fall out? \n\nThank you! You may want to use the 2% minoxidil instead of the 5%.  I have been using Minox for almost a year now.

From what I understand that is correct. You can have peripheral inflammation that results in hair loss but not follicular scarring. I have a bit of both. The goal is to minimize inflammation and pustular activity until it either burns out or you get lucky and achieve remission. At that point you can try minoxidil or propecia and see what grows back.

I will be starting on Thursday when it arrives in the mail! I hope to keep this post as a little journal for you all to read and ask questions.\n\nWhy Humira for FD? Humira is a TNF-alpha blocker. TNF-alpha is what causes inflammation in the body. Humira is used for several inflammation autoimmune disorders such as plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. The Humira will block the TNF-alpha in the body in turn decreasing the inflammation of the hair follicles thus decreasing the scarring.\n\nThere have been 3 published cases of Humira successfully treating FD. I am hoping that it can be successful for me as well. It is a pretty intense medication though with some very rare but very severe side effects. With all my research though I am still comfortable taking Humira and crossing my fingers super tight that this will work for me. \n\nThere still is not a cure, though. If I respond well to this, then it will be a medication I take for the rest of my life. My FD has been resistant to all other treatments including antibiotics, dapsone, and isotretinoin. I am female, 33 years old, and I have been dealing with this since 2010.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions at all! You can ask on here or send me a dm. I was considering taking Humira as well when I was insured but decided against it in the end.  Just like you, I became resistant to antibiotics and topical solutions never did anything for me but luckily isotretinoin seemed to lower the intensity of my FD.

Thank you Diary entry #1: Monday, January 11, 2021\n\nI started Humira on Friday, Jan 8. I was able to afford Humira using their patient coupon program and just pay $5/month. It comes in shot form where you inject it in your stomach or thighs. The needle comes in a device that looks like an epipen. It needs to be stored in the fridge until you take it out 30 minutes before injection. \n\nFor the loading dose I took 2 shots. I did both of them in my stomach. I did not feel it at all. The needles are the smallest and I am on the citrate free Humira. I took it in the evening just in case if I got a headache from it. I did not feel any bad side effects from it. The pharmacist said I would most likely get a headache but nothing ever happened. \n\nIt is Monday now and I can feel the crown of my head is on the smoother side. It is still bumpy from the scar tissue and always will be. I asked my husband to take a look and he said he could not believe how normal my scalp looks. It is not red or inflamed anymore. I still have a few pink spots from sores healing but overall, he says it looks normal and healthy.\n\nI take my next shot on Friday 1/22/21. And then 2 weeks after that I take a shot every Friday. \n\nI was skeptical I would see results so soon but reading on the r/Humira sub, other people have seen positive results in a short time on it as well. I just made a comment here updating how my first shot went if you wanted to read it if you are still thinking about Humira for yourself. This is awesome. Im very happy for you and that it keeps getting better. I am terrified of most meds, but am seriously considering bringing this up. Insurance may try to fight...but I think this needs to be easier to get with this condition. \n\nI cannot wait to hear more updates. Big hugs. Hey there. How often do you think you will be doing updates? Weekly? Monthly? Ive a derm appt tomorrow and wanted to bring up Humira as a nuclear option. Hope you are well. \n\nLess itch? No itch? That sounds similar to my FD. Have been on several antibiotics (longest being Rifampin and Clindamycin) which worked well until they slowly lost effectiveness. Then had two courses of isotretinoin which seemed to permanently reduce the intensity of my inflammation. Now it is mild enough that I am just looking for the right topicals to get it to zero.

By Wed/Thurs there is inflammation and it does hurt a little. Then repeat the shot on Friday.\n\nMy husband says my scalp used to look like leprosy but it is now a healthy pinkish white. \n\nI need to reach out to my dermatologist and tell him the good news. I also need to be getting blood work done while on Humira. \n\nI recommend this treatment. However, there can be fatal side effects so totally do your research on it.

All my hair grew back.\n\nDifferent things work for different people, but if you are suffering from this condition I recommend you ask your dermatologist about clindamycin.", "My decalvans journal Hey everyone,\n\nI am 25 years old and my first lesion appeared 3 months ago. At the time I thought it was just a regular pimple (I sometimes got these on my scalp from time to time) and did not think much of it. Within a month it very quickly became clear that was not the case. It began to spread, and I had multiple lumps discharging pus and blood, and hair loss occurring rapidly in those spots.\n\nI was concerned at this point and went to my GP, which sadly, managed my situation completely incompetently. I had standard blood tests - thyroid levels normal, generally healthy. She examined the lesions but did not take any tests or samples. For reasons I do not quite understand, she at first believed they were fat deposits, and sent me home with instructions to reduce intake of saturated fats in my diet. I returned several weeks later as the condition continued to spread. She now thought it might be a case of folliculitis, and prescribed a 3 week course of doxicycline. I felt my condition improve significantly during this time, though two or three lesions remained. During this time, based on my own research and in the interest of ruling out fungal infection, I used nizoral 2% shampoo as directed on the bottle, to no real effect. At this point, researching online, I came across folliculitis decalvans and thought the description of the condition and its progression matched my own situation. I visited my GP again, and she refused to prescribe antibiotics again, indicating that a 3 week course should have been sufficient for folliculitis. She instead asked me to use a headlice treatment to rule out the possibility that this was a parasite. When I suggested decalvans, she did not know what I was talking about.\n\nNeedless to say, I am finished with her. \n\nI attempted to make an appointment with a dermatologist, but no dermatologist in my city is available in the next 6 months (yay, free healthcare!) \n\nI was lucky enough to find a GP who is studying for a specialty in dermatology, and booked an appointment. It was immediately apparent that he intended to be far more proactive. He requested to use my case as a case study, which I consented to, sent me to get tested for syphilis to rule it out, and booked me in for a biopsy. His initial impression was that the condition was not scarring, as he could still see hair follicles on the bald spots when observing under magnification, but he said we should wait until the biopsy to be certain.\n\nWhen I attended the biopsy appointment earlier this week, it seems he did his own research and consulted with some dermatologists on his case study, and now appears to believe it is folliculitis decalvans, as I suspected from the beginning. He says that the reason follicles were still visible is that the alopecia is progressive - the scarring occurs as a result of prolonged inflamation, so that if we treat in time, it might be possible that some of the follicles can still be saved and the hair regrown.\n\nThe biopsy turned out to in fact be two biopsies. Two 3mm punch biopsies were performed, to the best of my understanding, one taking a sample from a lesion, and one taking a sample from healthy scalp tissue for comparison. I currently have the stitches in, and expect to have them taken out and my results confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nI am writing this thread for any of you who might be in a similar position, and also for myself, to keep track of my progress as I attempt to deal with this condition. I already \"suffer\" from male pattern baldness (this really does not bother me), but the addition of very unnatural-looking and unpleasant hair loss from folliculiitis decalvans is having a tremendous negative impact on my self-esteem and mental health. I have never been very successful with women, and even though I know it is childish, this is really what is on my mind with this condition more than anything else.\n\nI am going to endeavour to keep this updated regularly with any research and progress I make.\n\n-------------------\n\n**26/02/2016**\n\nVisibly affected areas are marked in these photos (excuse the ickyness, I am not allowed to wash my hair while the stitches are in).\n\n* ( - A single lesion. After draining, left a bald spot.\n* ( - There seem to be a few lesions which sometimes flare up but have not yet caused any hair loss. Generally, the least affected parts of my head.\n* ( - This spot was formerly a lump which cleared up by itself and left behind a large patch of hair loss. Some of the hair appears to be regrowing, but a new lump has formed now and I expect to lose the hair again.\n* ( - By far the most severely affected part of my head at this stage, and also the site of the two punch biopsy marks. Pretty gross, you have been warned. I can feel several other lesions under my hair on the right side, but they do not appear to be causing comparable hair loss at this stage.\n\nIf my biopsy confirms my doctor's diagnosis, this here is my plan of action.\n\nI have carried out a great deal of research this past week, or at least as much as I am capable of as a layperson. I came across a number of interesting articles and studies, but probably the most useful and comprehensive of those are ( and ( which I highly recommend to anyone affected for their excellent discussions of treatment options and their efficacy.\n\nIt seems that the most effective treatment at this stage is multiple courses of 8-12 weeks of clindamycin and rifampicin twice daily (have a look at the table on page 6 of the second study), followed by doxycycline and minocycline. However, relapse seems to be inevitable, and it is only a question of when rather than if. \n\nAside from this, I see no harm in trying some less conventional options. I intend to begin taking zinc supplements (the first study noted that oral zinc sulfate appeared to produce positive results in 3 patients), using tea tree oil shampoo, and if I can get my hands on it, some milk of magnesia (this one seems to be entirely anecdotal, I have not seen any studies refer to it).\n\nI have seen some references to diet and gut health being relevant - though again, not in any serious studies. Even so, it cannot hurt to try. I have suffered from IBS for several years, so the possiblity of a connection is plausible in my personal experience. I would be interested to hear if any of you are also affected by IBS. I intend to basically start on a dairy-free paleo diet beginning next week, and will attempt to increase my intake of fermented foods as well as supplementing with a probiotic daily.\n\nI will keep updating as to my progress.\n\n-------------------\n\n**08/03/2016**\n\nThe biopsy results came back not definitive. Some fungal spores were detected, but the report said they were probably benign. There was some scarring of the follicles observed, but it is not yet widespread, and one of the biopsy samples showed no scarring at all, giving me hope that if the right treatment is found a lot of the hair may yet regrow. My GP put me back on doxycycline to reduce the inflammation while we figure out what we are dealing with. I have been taking it for exactly one week now.\n\nMy GP referred me to a dermatologist specialising in cicatricial alopecias, and I was lucky enough to be able to get an appointment today. She diagnosed **dissecting cellulitis**. I was surprised that she considered dissecting cellulitis to be the underlying condition, because my face and neck have been affected. She agreed that she had never seen that before, but that the presentation more closely resembled DCS than FD. She has prescribed oral erythromycin and prednisolone to reduce the inflammation as quickly as possible, as well as performing intralesional steroid injections at her office today. In two weeks, once the doxycycline is out of my system, I will also start taking isotretinoin daily. \n\nI am washing with both head and shoulders and tea tree oil shampoo daily, as well as supplementing with zinc as discussed above.\n\nI am quite concerned about the possible side effects of isotretinoin. Have any of you used it before?\n\nMore photos to follow shortly. Wish me luck.\n\n", "Dapsone? Any positive/negative feedback about Dapsone? Have to take a blood test to see if I can take it soon. Side effects have me concerned.\n\nThanks! I took dapsone 2.5 years ago. I honestly cannot remember any side effects. I had to get my blood tested like every month while I was on it. Unfortunately, it did not do a thing for me.  Good luck with it and keep us posted! (I will be starting humira soon.)\n\n(Funny story. 2.5 years ago, I had to be admitted to the hospital for a blood clot in my leg. I told the nurse all the meds I was taking including dapsone. She went off to put it in the computer and came back looking very worried. \"Do you have aids or are hiv positive?\" I was like, umm no. Turns out dapsone is a common medication for aids/hiv positivity. She was very surprised I was taking it for a scalp skin condition.) Thank you for the reply. I will keep you posted. I am very interested in your Humira treatment. I hope it brings you relief. I wish I could jump on Humira now... I started my course of dapsone about 3 weeks ago (2*50mg a day). Also had to get my blood tests done initially which were fine.\n\nSo far it is resulted in a complete reduction of my spots, my lymph nodes are also back to normal (they usually get large when I have a flare up).  \n\nMy dermatologist is planning a long term course for me (about 6 months). Will try to update with my symptoms throughout the course.\n\nSo far this is the only thing that has worked for me outside of Roaccutane (the side effects were too harsh) and amoxicillin (which is only a short term fix, it also should not be taken long term). In both cases there is always recurrence a few weeks after. I did a course of Dapsone years ago and I did not get many side effects that I recall. It unfortunately did not result in remission for me but I have read promising studies. I think this was right before I tried Methotrexate. How goes it, Chilli? I am about 10 days on Dapsone. My scalp has reddened a bit, but and sticking I am there. I figure the switch from Minocycline to Dapsone has a transition period. Did your spots lessen gradually as the treatment went on? Yes I have still had no new breakouts for a while. Though I may need to get some more to carry on for at least 3 to 6 months.\n\nI would say if you go on for more than 14 days without improvement then it is time to try something else.\n\nI know it is hard and I wish there was one magical cure for everyone but FD varies a lot from person to person. How is the Humira treatment? Ugh, I totally forgot to call my doctor today. I got blood tests done a month ago. He needed to call my rheumatologist to discuss me going on humira. I am so close to getting on it yet so far away. My goal: in January I will finally go on it.", "UPDATE:New diagnosis: Keratosis Folliculitis Spinolosa Decalvans If you look three or four posts down.

The drug involved (Dapsone) has very little side effects( I can drink, it does not affect the liver at all). Tips for spotting KFSD (inflammed eyebrows, keratin pimples on body (Keratosis Pilaris) and the usual decalvans scarring alopecia. Some say they have dry eyes as well but I personally do not.)\n\nKeep your head up guys, I was in a really bad situation. If you are not responding to your assigned treatment, seek out a specialist if possible. Happy for you! :) Dapsone is a bad drug if taken for a long time. You will notice a nice drop in your blood RBCs.I was one dapsone for 2 years and had little effect because my pathogen was not staphylococcus.\nI was on Zinc and dapsone. Still, its great that it works for you.\n(The really messed up part of the disease is that there is no single universal remedy) I have not seen my specialist in about a year and a half. After reading this I am going to contact my Doctor again and try to get this Dapsone stuff. I have Pretty bad FD on my scalp. It started when i was 19, I am 39 now. I have tried almost everything, Steroid injections in my scalp and all sorts of oral medication. It has calmed down a little bit but i have permanent bald patches and scaring. I have also had Keratosis Pilaris on my arms from a very young age but its never really bothered me but reading you are post makes me think these conditions are linked.

I guess this post is to help lessen the anxiety of it all. The mental health can take a beating when you do not know when(or if) this will burn out.\n\nDo most people here just grin and bare the outcome of the hair loss? Do you simply accept it and not hide it? Or do you conceal it best you can?\n\nWith guys, its seems like shaving your head is the best route to go--but if it is still red/active, is that the best way to go since it can irritate the scalp more.\n\nI am aware that accepting and not caring what others think is the way to go...but I am not there yet. I just do not want to deal with the questions about it from others.\n\nMore of a vent, but am also interested in others coping mechanisms. I buzz my hair to the shortest possible length. As for the red skin. Sometimes it is obvious but currently the short  hair provide some camouflage similar to pigmentation. Which made me consider scalp pigmentation. I received god compliments from my friends with the short hair look.  I recommend giving it a shot!\n\n\nAlso one paper mentioned reduction of FD after shortening the hair. I confirm this finding myself but do not over estimate this reduction. I am a guy and I have progressively started to wear hats more often in public as my hair thins out from the inflammation. I have medium length hair now, although I am considering buzzing it in the future. Toppik looks interesting but I have not tried it yet. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that people pay way less attention to you than you think. Everybody is more concerned about themselves and how they look vs what other people look like. I agree about everyone else being concerned with themselves. While adapting and accepting this crappy affliction, I was interested in what people do to minimize it. \n\nI have applied dermatch to the spots that stood out the most after I did a buzz cut. Looks okay...Buzzing did irritate my scalp, but the weight of the longer hair was constantly angering the follicles. Do you take Propecia, Decalvans? Probably has not improved things much in other areas? I went zero guard. Is the what you do? No worsening irritation? Years ago, I did try a brief course of Proscar which is essentially extra strength Propecia (5mg dose of Finasteride). It did not control inflammation or result in much regrowth as far as I could tell and I was a bit nervous about side effects. If my inflammation gets calm enough I will try Minoxidil (Rogaine). Yeah, I am wary of the side effects too with finasteride. The doc is talking about Dapsone next. Have not seen too many studies. One or two. I will try to be better about posting what I have been on and what is keeping things \"quiet\". Maybe we can make a sticky thread on here soon on what is worked and what has not for us. Hang in there. I will try to do the same.", "Encouragement I am struggling today. I am sure many if not all of you have had those days also. What got you by? Dumping Clobetosal and taking tylenol did not do much. Icing the head is gave temporary relief. I zero guard buzzed my head, and this may have made things worse. The Dapsone really is not working that well. \n\nNot sure how to get past this. Cannot focus on my job today. I think the hair loss is secondary to the discomfort lately. On less itchy/burning/pain days-I am so much more hopeful and positive. \n\nIt did not help that a dermatologist (soon to be fired) gaslit me. The discomfort was dismissed and he did not see they hair thinning and loss. Others have, but he did not. Strange.\n\nStruggling. Hopefully tomorrow will be better. Oh, dear! I am so sorry you have been going through such a tough time right now with your scalp. Here is how I deal with my bad days (which I am actually having one today. So. Much. Itching.)\n\nInstead of Tylenol, you will want to take ibuprofen, which is an anti-inflammatory and will help with the scalp's inflammation.\n\nI use ketoconazole shampoo. That helps relieve the itching and inflammation as well.\n\nAnd instead of ice I put a warm pack on my scalp and that helps relax it away.\n\nI hope you all the best and you will be able to find a dermatologist who listens to you. When you do find one, see if they will give you steroid injections in the scalp. I go about every 6 weeks and that helps with the inflammation as well. (And for me it feels so good. The pain of the needle is like an itch finally being scratched.) I have definitely had some bad days. Less often now as my FD is not as intense as it has been in the past, likely due to my isotretinoin courses but who knows. For quick relief I use topical clobetasol or topical clindamycin along with Advil. My inflammation/pustular activity wax and wane randomly which makes me think something in my diet or environment is a factor.\n\nIt sounds like you need a new dermatologist. For folks with rare conditions like us, we really need to see specialists that stay current on research. I recommend the physician referral on the CARF website in the sidebar. Even then, doctor visits can be frustrating as they run out of treatment ideas and start asking you for suggestions, but at least they understand.\n\nUltimately you have to try to remain hopeful and positive, the alternative just is not helpful. We have a rare disease but talented and bright medical minds are researching potential cures all over the world, I have met a few a them and they do care. A cure will come one day. There are also documented cases of the disease burning out over time and a chance your inflammatory activity will slowly diminish. Anecdotally, I have not taken oral medicine since early October, just occasional topicals, and my scalp activity level is about a 3 or 4 out 10. \n\nBest of luck, it will get better. I would not advise ibuprofen or tylenol as they are nsaids and can cause issues of their own. Look into diet, many report going AIP diet really helping them. Zyrtec at 20-30mg a day seems to effectiveness against lpp. Not sure what condition you have but GL. I feel you buddy. I also had a shitty dermatologist. Who even got jealous and bitchy cuz i asked to transfer my case to another derm.\n\nAnyway, past month were hard on my few things i can suggest:\n\n1. Itchiness can make you do bad decisions such as over washing your hair. Over using steroids or antibiotics (topical) or over scratching those contribute to the itchiness so try not do that.\n\n2. Boil Curcuma and drink it. It is anti inflammatory and proven to block TNF-a. It is not magical but it helped me\n\n3. Cut everything inflammatory sugar etc... And use more anti-inflammatory stuff like curcuma green tea etc..\n\n4. Warm press helps more the cold for me.\n\n5. Wash your her with diluted apple cidar vinegar. Do not forget to wash it afterwards.\n\n\nIm currently on isotretinoin 20 mg  it took a year till i started getting better but i am better starting this month.\n\nOne day to this shit will be over. In the majority of the cases it burns itself. Some people have excellent response to therapy and never bothered about this again. It is hard but you are strong! Sometimes it feels like a daily battle against FD.

Does your scalp get dry and itchier?\n\n(", "An update, two years later Hello all,\n\nThis is an update to my initial post two years ago: \n\nIn summary, after being diagnosed with dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, I was put on a combination of steroids, antibiotics and isotretinoin. The steroids were discontinued first, then the antibiotics after they started causing severe chest pain, and finally the isotretinoin after about 6 months of taking it. \n\nThe immediate results, as far as my dissecting cellulitis goes, were positive. The massively inflamed nodules virtually disappeared, and although the scarring is permanent, it no longer bothers me. The remission lasted for about a year before new nodules began to appear.\n\nHowever, I have been extremely put off by the side effects and unintended effects I experienced as a result of the treatment, and unless the disease becomes very severe, I do not see myself going down that path again. Immediately after stopping the steroids and antibiotics, I experienced (for the first time) the emergence, and massive flare up, of inflammatory bowel disease. As some of you may know, there is some dispute about whether isotretinoin can cause inflammatory bowel disease. While the debate continues, my own personal experience suggests a fairly definite answer... In addition, in the months since I stopped taking isotretinoin, my skin generally has fared poorly. I now have small nodules on my neck and face, which do not appear to be filled with pus or anything else, and seem to be permanent. \n\nI am now also taking mesalasine for my IBD, which probably has some small effect on controlling the inflammation of my dissecting cellulitis, because while I now have nodules all over my scalp, they tend to be smaller and less inflamed than before, and do not cause hair loss. \n\nHowever, it seems I am to have no rest, as I have recently begun experiencing the symptoms of arthiritis in my knees at the ripe old age of 27. I understand that arthiritis is an association of both dissecting cellulitis and IBD...\n\nMy mental state has improved a great deal, because for some reason, I simply no longer care. While I wish I could be rid of all of these, there is no use dwelling on things beyond my control. \n\nI have been trying various supplements based on whatever medical research I can find about reducing systemic inflammation. Interestingly, these do seem to have some mild effect on both my IBD and dissecting cellulitis. I cannot be sure which supplement is doing it (as I have been taking multiple supplements at once), but I think daily vitamin D has helped. I have also found some research that might support this: \n\nIt would be great to hear how some of you are doing, and whether you have found anything that works for you. It is a rough disease, and the treatments are often almost as bad. I have been passed around by a number of specialists and I have been on dozens of medicines in the last 12 years. The last 5 years have mostly been filled with periodic lancing and cyndamycin. Rifampin was the best med by far and put me in remission for 6 months after just 1 month of treatment, but I was also hospitalized over the side effects. It is a balancing act. To me you seem like the perfect candidate for an TNFa or Il17 inhibitor (Adalimumab, Infliximab or Secukinumab) if your insurance covers that. It will 1) Treat our IBD 2) Treat your reavtive arthritis 3) Maybe take away your DC. Your problem is autoimmune, something out of the rheumatoid spectrum (PASH, SAPHO,...) even though not matching any of them exactly. Follow the link for a case report and case series (low evidence, but suggestive that you might profit). I guess your IBD is not directly related to isotretinoin. It is just that people with follicular occlusion triad are prone to developing especially crohns.\n\n \n\nperma-lien\n", "Q: have topical steroids made seborrheic dermatitis worse for you?

But I am trying to get one booked now. Every time derms look at my hair they say there are no bald spots. There is definitely spots of thinner hair I can see that myself. I think I definitely have LPP and the biopsy I think will confirm that. If the follicule remain then can the hair grow back when it is not inflamed or even if it is not scarred it cannot come back? I can see short hairs here and there on my scalp which prop up. I am dealing with same. It is frustrating seeing those little standing hairs not doing anything. I have it and have diffuse loss..

If so that is strange as only a specialist can do that. Also I have looked at your images you do not seem to have redness flakiness or anything of the sort on your scalp. If you think you have this you need to get a biopsy from a specialist so then they can give you treatment. Also lpp does not cause hair loss elsewhere only where it is active it does.

Hi all,\n\nSo an update for me, after going off the doxycycline and using the clindamycin topical treatment, I have had some really positive results.  I urge any of you who have been placed on oral antibiotics as a first point of call to get your doctor/derm to try you on a topical treatment, because after applying it for about a month my pustules disappeared entirely and I stopped using it (when I was on doxy they would reappear *immediately* after I stopped taking it).  That was about four months ago, and I have had one brief minor relapse since, and I applied the topical treatment once more and the pustules and scabs have again disappeared completely.\n\nSo very happy.  However, lately I have begun noticing strands of hair appearing on my keyboard.  Not an overwhelming amount, and only single strains, but regularly, especially, for some reason, at night.  I check my pillow and mattress and there does not seem to be an unreasonable amount there, but when I comb my hair over the sink for 60 seconds I count up to 30 loose strands that have been dislodged, and based on a study I read the average is 10.  I know that we lose up to 200 strands of hair every day, and so I cannot work out whether I am just paranoid and noticing hair loss that was always there, or whether this is indeed more than usual.  \n\nSo this has me worried that I am losing my hair, despite having no pustules on my head, no swelling, no scabs, nothing.  Has anyone had any experience with this?  Has your hair loss always been related to the 'swelling' and 'pustules', or has it also occurred generally, a kind of 'global effect' regardless of flare ups?  I am weighing up whether to see my derm, but it is expensive, and like I said, it is not like I am seeing clumps of hair in the shower drain, or all over my pillow, or anything like that, so it is possible I am overthinking this and it is just normal.\n\nThought I would check in and get your thoughts.", "Awaiting biopsy results - see comment  ", "Diet and Scarring Alopecia Hi everyone,\n\nI have recently noticed that diet is a common thread among several posters here. I wanted to ask a few questions and get feedback from those that have tried a diet change to improve their scalp condition. Crowd sourcing this data may surface interesting trends or insights worth pursuing and researching further.\n\n-\tWhat did you change or eliminate from your diet?\n-\tDid it result in scalp improvement?\n-\tIf so, to what degree? Mild improvement or complete remission?\n-\tHow long did it take for the diet to have an effect?\n-\tIf you were to break the diet today, how long would it take to impact your scalp?\n-\tWhat scarring hair loss condition do you have?\n\nThanks in advance for sharing. Hi, I havent tried a specific diet yet but I am starting to think I may react badly to gluten so I will test avoiding this and keep you updated. \n\nI did try intermittent fasting (to reduce inflammation generally, and to lose weight) and it seems to have somewhat attenuated the quantity and strength of the reactions.. Maybe you can do a gluten allergy test to confirm that suspicion.

Switching to a plant based whole foods diet and cutting out sugar has helped, but only in combination with medication. At the end of the day, I would still have symptoms and hair loss on a plant based diet if I stopped my medication. I have tested out having small amounts of sugar and usually I can trigger a bad flare up after just a few days of eating something sugary. I know it is contributing, but it is certainly not the whole story.

Oral Metformin is in the top ten most popular prescribed medications and is typically used for diabetes. The study below found that Topical Metformin reduced disease activity and promoted hair regrowth without side effects in two CCCA patients. Has anyone tried or heard of this relatively new treatment?\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nDecalvans Hi I have actually been using topical metformin since about February 2021 combined with docycyline and I have been having improvement for sure. I have 2 types have hair loss and it is been helping along with docy for the scarring. I hope that by this time next year I can ditch my wig. Have you seen any growth? I started in March 2021 as well Yes I have seen growth for sure. My ccca was in the very early stages but areas of the crown were clearly thinning. It has filled in about 70- 80 percent. With only a few areas that are still sparse but I suspect as I continue the course by year end or the 1 year mark it will be covered by the surrounding hair. The doxycycline has absolutely improved my symptoms of itching burning and inflammation in the scalp. My scalp feels mostly normal with the occasional odd feeling. No more intense pain like before. \n\nI am also still getting shots to the area occasionally as I have decided to be agressive with treatment to slow/halt the disease process since it is early. \n\nThe met formin has helped coupled with doxycycline. That is great! I will have to ask my doctor about this at my next visit. Is it a liquid solution or a cream? I have had trouble applying creams to my scalp through my hair. Do you think the topical Metformin has helped more than the Doxycycline? How has your experience been with topical Metformin? Any success so far? I started the end of March/ beginning of April. Metformin is mixed in a special emulsion and come out like a white cream.  Dissolves pretty decently into the scalp but I add some type of oil so it does not make me look \u201cashy\u201d\n\nI have not noticed much of a difference yet.  My CCCA maybe a little more advanced as I am definitely seeing a good amount of balding and thinning but my locs hide it pretty decently. \n\nI have also had 1 round of scalp steroid injections at the end of a March \n\nI am definitely interested in doxycycline because I feel like at times I can definitely feel my scalp \u201con fire\u201d.  Will need to chat with my dermatologist at my next appt.  it is only been about 2 months so I am hoping to see some changes I think the doxycycline has helped more because it is working on the internal inflammation. The metformin has helped as well but I think the doxycycline has helped more because it is stronger. But I do think the 2 combined with occasional shots and avoiding high inflammatory foods for me helped so much.\n\nAs for the metformin I is compounded into an oil with was irritating at first. So what I do is apply my own hair oil first, I am using Indian hemp hair grease, and then the metformin and massage into the area. I think for straighter hair types the cream would be better. That makes sense. I messaged a Hair Doctor about Cicatricial Alopecia and he said that he prescribes Anti-Diabetic or Anti-Malarial tablets for it.\n\nHow do I get topical Metformin? Dermatologist Hi /u/Cwendy330, wanted to follow up and see how your scalp was doing. Is the topical Metformin treatment helping?", "Dairy &amp; FD About four years ago I had a bad case of FD. I did the tetracyclines, which did not really work the first time. Coincidentally, by this time I stopped drinking milk since I was only doing it out of habit and not necessarily because I liked it \u2500 also, it made me seriously bloated. \n\nA few months later I saw another dermatologist. By this point my FD was not as aggressive as it used to be, so he prescribed 20mg isotretinoin for about 4 months. That kept the FD dormant for a couple months after finishing the regimen. Then it came back, although in a milder form. I went back to the dermatologist and got started on another minocycline regimen. Same result. \n\nAround that time I noticed that something in my breakfast (butter on toast and coffee) was making me bloated, giving me cramps, the whole works. I tried different types of bread and eventually cut the coffee cup, but the culprit was the unsuspected butter, which was the only dairy product I was still consuming day-to-day. \n\nMaybe consequentially, maybe not, my FD started fading from that point onward and I have been free from it since then. Every time I indulge in something containing dairy my FD starts presenting itself the following days, only to go away later. \n\nThe bloating suggests I may be lactose intolerant. Either way, most commercially available dairy products are not really all that good for you. Most lactating cows are not eating what they are supposed to and are being injected with growth hormones which may or may not be done in by pasteurization, with this latter process becoming dubious as we find out more about the benefits of the microbiome, and so on.\n\nNow, I have hesitated posting this here for a while since it seems too anecdotal an evidence to be taken seriously by people facing such an inconspicuously excruciating disease. We are usually very resistant to people telling us to change our diet \u2500 I know I was, and the only one telling me to do it was myself \u2500 but give it a go for 6 months or so, and see how you fare. It may work for some of you.", "Possible FD or DC - Flakiness? Hi All,\n\nSo I have been dealing with scalp issues for about a year now. I have two different issues in two separate areas of my scalp. On the back of my head, I get bad, painful breakouts.  On the front of my scalp at the hairline, I get really bad flakiness and scaliness, which I believe is causing hair loss. It also itches bad in the front when I sweat.\n\nAfter visiting numerous dermatologist, the latest one did a biopsy on one of the breakouts on the back of my scalp. The test results showed dissecting cellulitis with the possibility of FD. My dermatologist thinks that both of my issues (front and back) are being caused by the DC (or FD). \n\nI had previously been on doxycycline, which was pretty effective with the breakouts but not as much with the flakiness. After my test results, my dermatologist put me on Accutane..  I started Accutane about five days ago. Since I had to go off the doxy, the breakouts have come back with a vengeance. I also seem to have worse flakiness on the front.\n\nI am hoping if I give the Accutane so more time, I will start seeing results. In the meantime, I am wondering if anyone has had similar problems or some advice. I do fear that my dermatologist is wrong about the flakiness/hair loss in the front being caused by DC (or FD). Wherever I read about those diseases, I do not seem to see a lot of complaints about flakiness/itchiness; instead I see complaints about pustules and breakouts (which, for me, are concentrated on the back of my scalp). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I just found out about this reddit group, and it is refreshing to hear from people who might be suffering from the same issues. It is been pretty hard on me mentally and physically lately. Thanks! First of all, welcome to the subreddit. I hope that I and others can be of help and a network. I think that symptoms can manifest differently for everyone. I think it is probably best to trust your doctors opinion, but also use some healthy skepticism. These are difficult to treat and sometimes difficult to diagnose conditions. I personally have only experienced flakiness after I had a breakout(pimples) and then the skin recovered, leaving scabs that eventually flake off. I would say this probably supports your theory, but it is not the be all, end all. I was diagnosed with gram negative FD I believe if that helps at all. \n\nI do not know if this has been helpful, but I am here to bounce any ideas off if you want. Flakiness, redness and itching is part of FD. What helped me was Accutane and afterwards Altabax. \n\nMy flakes came from scabs which formed after the pustles healed. What every you do, make sure your dermatologist is agressive,. Once there is scarring, your hair will not grow back. Do you recall how long it took until you saw any positive effects from Accutane? I am going on 8 days now without seeing a difference.\n\nFrankly, the doxycycline was way more effective for me. But I get that these things take some time to work... I never heard of \"gram negative\" FD. Is that different than other types of FD? \n\nThanks for the feedback. I really appreciate it. Yes it is, and no problem. Quick question, how much sleep are you getting and in general doing things that support immune system health? It took months. I think i was on accutane for 3 or 4 months. It shrinks your follicles so that Bacteria cannot grow in it, In my case, Accutane made my condition worse the first month due to its effects and after that it got better. When I say made the condition worse, it caused some pustules, redness and scarring. I still have flares occasionally. I noticed sugar and oily foods trigger inflammation, so I try to cut them down.", "This is currently my boyfriends head. He is feeling really down about it and worried it will be permeant scarring. Has anyone come back from a case like this?  I have had worse and came back from it 100%. Stay positive! Much love and support. Aww, poor thing! I remember when my scalp looked like this. Is it folliculitis decalvans? I have FD and after several years of trying out different meds, I finally found something to keep inflammation down. Looks like FD. I have FD and with treatment my hair grew back and my flare ups are now very mild. Tell your bf to find a good derm who understands FD, avoid oral antibiotics if possible, and try topical antibiotics like clindamycin. It all but cured my FD.\n\nTell him also to go on an anti inflammatory diet in the meantime if he wants to minimise the progression. Low carb/sugar and no gluten.\n\nTell him not to freak out, stress will certainly make it worse. FD is treatable but it is about finding the right treatment for him. That will take some trial and error. I repeat, though, avoid oral antibiotics. I was placed on oral antibiotics for a year and a half for this and it destroyed my gut microbiota and almost ruined my life.

I keep forgetting to update! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It is going great. I have had to also include being gluten free with the humira regimen and with both of those, my scalp is just normal. Hey I am also gluten free because I found out I am allergic to wheat. I have FD and luckily been on antibiotics kind of early. I do have some small bald spots and pink scalp with some inflammation. \nI was recommended humira but was iffy because it weakens immune system. So did it completely clear your scalp? Is it white? Did some hair grow back? How often do you have to get humira? I currently have decalvans and it is really bad. I have had it for years. Please what can I do to treat it? I second FD. \n\nOral Apremilast/Otezla is another option if first and second line treatments do not work.\n\n Have you tried otezla/apremilast? Is clindamycin a lotion? How many times do you apply it? Did the redness go away? So a pill? How often do you take it? Yes it is. I only applied as needed, when there were flare ups. Now I do not need to ever apply it because any flare ups are mild. Yes a tablet. The full dose of otezla/apremilast is 30mg 2x daily. Ideally 12 hours apart. I have not tried that but I am going to look into it. How good is it at treating this? I am 100% certain based on this picture the condition is foliculitis decalvans. The turted hair and redness gives it away. It is a scarring alopecia.", "Humira vs glutenfree diet Does anyone here use Adalimumab who thinks they have a good effect from this? Have you tried both with and without, in combination with a gluten-free diet? Exciting to hear if the medicine itself is sufficient. I am GF and on humira. I need to do both in order to keep inflammation to a minimum. I tried humira with gluten and my inflammation came back. It was not horrible but still annoying. I recently added cetirizine (zyrtec; liquid 10 mg/once a day) to the regimen and that has also helped the inflammation/itching. I was already gluten free before when I got my blood work I was allergic to wheat and more foods. Make sure you stop eating anything your allergic too. I use oreca (low dose doxycycline) and clobetosol solution drops. My inflammation has been under control for a year now. Humira is reslly risky.

Doctors use to treat me with antihistamine thinking i am overreacting to my symptoms.\n\nAnyways, i have lost many hair since and my hair is becoming tufty in general.\n\nI was wondering what are the odds of eliminating FD with laser hair removal. I mean the risk of loosing hair and getting FD back is scary!\n\nI have found a paper about NG something laser. Which seem to worked with one patient with dark skin. Apparently the color of skin and hair is relevant when considering hair removal. However i do not have these characteristics yet i am not against the idea of removing my hair.\n\nAnything you guys know that you can share with me? I have actually been looking into this as well, although I find it extremely difficult to find anyone willing to perform laser removal on the scalp. But the idea seems to make sense though: If there are no hair follicles, then there cannot possibly be an infection of the follicles. I have seen a few papers about laser removal and FD as well. They all seem to demonstrate success. The only problem I can think of, besides actually finding someone willing to perform it like I said, is how would the laser removal technician remove the hair follicles if there is acne/scabs/cysts/scarring **OVER** them? Also, would the laser removal technician have to remove the hair on the entire scalp, or **JUST** the areas that are affected? There are many unanswered questions it seems. I have been reading about this, as you said there are signs that this should work in theory. However the hair color is very important as laser hair removal require dark hair. Not sure my hair is dark enough for this.", "Benzoyl Peroxide Hey everyone,\n\nI have read some recent anecdotal comments on other subreddits about the use of Benzoyl Peroxide as a potentially effective treatment for Folliculitis Decalvans and other scalp issues. In the spirit of crowdsourcing helpful data for this community, has anyone here tried using topical Benzoyl Peroxide for their condition and if so, what was the outcome and what was the product and method you used?\n\nI personally have started using Benzoyl Peroxide a little over a week ago. Knock on wood but this is the calmest my scalp has been in quite a while with very little scaling, inflammation, or pustules.

I get PanOxyl foaming wash. Been using it for a month or so. It is definitely helping quiet things a bit. Hey /u/why-arr-we-here, how is your scalp doing these days? I seemed to have settled into a new normal of light scaling and no pustules using the approach I mentioned. CeraVe Foaming Benzoyl Peroxide 4% applied every other day in the shower followed by Nizoral. It is actually calm enough that I am looking into minoxidil. What treatment are you on now and how active is your scalp? Do you think BP would even be worth using on a few clear white bald spots that have been there for about 6 months? I am clear of redness, etc but still have two small bald spots! I tried this a month ago as a i was having a flare. I can confirm that it is very helpful and maintains control over decalvans. I highly recommending using a benzoyl wash and apply benzoyl gel on high active areas. Although it is a bit difficult to apply the gel on the scalp if you do not have short hair.\n\nJust wanted to report on this. I thought i would wait until i feel that it is actually what is helping", "Can PRP Reverse SA? Hi guys. I know PRP injected into the scalp can help regrow hair.

At Weeks 2 and 4, highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) improvement was seen in all investigator evaluated attributes, including lesional erythema, lesional inflammatory papule size, extent of inflammatory papules, lesional pus, lesional pustule size, extent of pustules, and overall folliculitis assessment.\n\n&gt;\tThe present study examined azelaic acid, which possesses both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory qualities, in the topical treatment of folliculitis.11,12 The anti-inflammatory mechanism of action is unknown, but thought to be due to **neutrophil** function inhibition.13 The inflammatory response in keratinocytes might be due to PPAR gamma activation.14 In addition, azelaic acid is able to enter the milieu of the follicle, the site of pathology in folliculitis.\n\n", " Where do you guys live?

Unfortunately, once  the follicle is scarred it is destroyed (dead). There are not any treatments (yet) that are capable of getting rid of scarring or bringing a follicle back to life once it has been destroyed. I think the goal in treating scarring alopecia is to halt progression by preventing scarring from occurring. So starting treatments asap can help preserve as many follicles as possible. \n\nTopical Gaba is used to stabilize or halt the progression of scarring alopecias like LPP/FFA.

My MD took me off of the Rifampin/Clindamycin combo because I was on it for around four years straight. I am using Clobetasol a few times a week and my scalp is definitely more active with a few pustules but not as bad as it was several years ago. I think my 10 month course of high dose Accutane permanently moderated it but cannot be sure. \n\nI have now had FD for 11 years. Thinning a lot on my crown and middle scalp now but could be worse. After exhausting pretty much every option with my current doctor I am planning on flying to a few appointments with other leading doctors in the field to get their input. The last takeaway I had was to try Acitretin but I wanted to see another specialist or two before starting it. \n\nI do check PubMed and CARF for new Folliculitis Decalvans papers regularly and there are actually quite a few being published at a decent pace which is encouraging.\n\nHere is one on Manuka Honey.

Thanks for posting these articles. I am so thankful for this community, for years I thought I was the only one suffering alone. Any updates about the honey? New to this community been suffering with FD for nearly 5 years now, did you get a response from the authors of that journal about the honey? And/or did you use it yourself and see any results?\n\nCoincidentally I found this subreddit by looking for that article on google. I did not receive an email response from the author unfortunately. I bought some Manuka Honey myself but stopped trying after a few nights, it is beyond sticky and tough to apply directly to inflamed/pustular areas if you have a decent amount of hair. If I find a Manuka Honey liquid solution I may give it another shot.\n \nI am planning to visit some out of state specialists in 2020 to get more opinions and treatment options. So far I have only had success with either Rifampin/Clindamycin or Isotretinoin but neither are viable long term and I think both simply mask the underlying cause, whatever it may be (immune response/allergy/bacteria biome etc). Hi decalvans. You say you have FD. Is it similar to scarring alopecia? Hi Zlaer. Yes, Folliculitis Decalvans is a type of scarring alopecia. Usually neutrophil driven. I read about jak inhibitors being very effective for it. What do you think?", "Is biopsy necessary? 4 different dermatologists looked at my scalp with a dermatoscope and could not find anything abnormal.. no flaking or abnormal pigmentation . Should I still get a biopsy? Is it unlikely that I have scarring alopecia? Depends on your symptoms. I was at so many doctors for years and all said I am fine. Unluckily I am not... So multiple doctors looked at your scalp with a dermatoscope and said everything is fine? Yes. Some used dermatoscope some did not. I even was at a specialist for hair and he said I do not have it. What are your symptoms? If you have scalp pain, fine scaling and red skin there is a chance that you might have LPP. I knew something is wrong when I had a burning scalp and painful feeling when going through my hair...cause it is very rare, chances are very good you do not have it. Wish you all the luck I do have scalp pain sometimes. It hurts when running through my hair with my hand, but I do not have redness at all Redness can be very subtle. Do you have small bald spots in size of a rubber on a pencil? Do you have scaling? I see my scaling only when I put a small light direct to my scalp so that it shines sideways. I hope that is understandable, sorry no native speaker.. also when I rub my hair over a dark surface I see fine scaling on it Well I have dandruff .. I am quite sure that I have scarring alopecia but how did the doctors not find anything? Yes, it is necessary. I saw multiple dermatologists too, even though I had noticeable scars they told me there are multiple conditions that look the same, so they could only propose an hypothesis diagnosis and the biopsy will give as an answer.\nWhy do you think is scarring alopecia? Why not non-scarring types of alopecia? But they saw the scars on dermatoscope? \n\nI will get a biopsy. I am already applying minoxidil 2x/day tho, can this affect biopsy results ? Sorry, I do not know. In my case the scars where big.  I think you should ask to your doctor about the medication. Good luck with the biopsy. I had a full head of hair and redness was subtle. All dermatologist were not really doctors IMO....I came they looked for few minutes and sent me out with a shampoo and said there is nothing. They want to make just quick cash and not really help So you had redness? What did they say about the redness? One said it is from blood circulation under my scalp. One said she sees no redness. Another said it is very minimal. When you do not come with scarred patches it is difficult for derms... cause it is so rare, most people do not know how the first stages look I did not get anywhere for about a year with my dermatologist until I started having balding. At that point I did the biopsy, was super quick only took about 10 minutes for everything. Did not even have to come back to remove stitches. If it is anxiety about the biopsy your worried about I would say it was super easy and I did not feel anything but the initial numbing shot. I got my results back in a week and we were finally able to start my treatment. Do not wait until your in a lot of pain or losing all your hair. \nHope this helps :) Your dermatologist could not see anything abnormal under dermatoscope? Not really. They said it was just a dry scalp and gave me a shampoo. Like I said they did not take me seriously until I lost half of my hair. This is what I am scared of. False diagnosis Exactly. That is why it is best to go with the biopsy, you will know right away what you have. Biopsies are not always necessary and can even be inconclusive. The single most important thing is to find a talented dermatologist specialized in hairloss. Talented dermatologists can diagnose you clinically without biopsy.", "Malassezia folliculitis vs FD I have had hair loss, big flake buildup and bleeding patches on my scalp.

It is not debilitating nor contagious. It would not get in the way of your duties. It is not a disability. I think you should try to call a recruitment center or ask your doctor for certainty. Thanks for the response. It is just that conditions like psoriasis and eczema can be disqualifying factors so I would assume FD would be kind of grouped up with those but I will call the recruitment centre soon and see what they say. Wow! I had no idea psoriasis and eczema could disqualify one from the British army.  I can see why you are worried now. Apologies for the delayed reply. I hope my experience can be of some help here. \n\nI joined the British Army in 2009 when my FD was at its worst (Hair loss, itchiness and some scarring). \n\nFrom memory I do believe it was listed on my entry medical but was never raised as a major cause of concern. \n\nI went on to spend 8 years in the forces with multiple overseas deployments. Before each deployment/exercise medical would supply a sufficient prescription of oxytetracycline.\n\nYou are right to say that some forms of skin issues can be a cause of concern. As you can imagine psoriasis and 2 weeks in a forest are not a good mixture. However, I believe this all comes down to the severity of the skin condition. \n\nIn short your mileage may vary and the severity of your condition will be a major factor and your initial medical will confirm. But the short answer is you can absolutely have a successful career in the Army with FD and it never came up as a barrier for me.\n\nMy advice would be to at least apply and take the medical before giving up on your ambitions. \n\nWhatever you decide I wish you all the very best.

My skin was so bad I had many surgeries and I still have many procedures to ease and control the disease (there is no cure). I have had my scalped replaced, laser hair removal procedures, and Accutane significantly helps control the pain and flare ups I still have. I am definitely open to sharing and speaking with you more about the disease and what helps me; including pictures from the actual surgeries and pics from then to now of the disease.

Probably the reason I had to go the route of having a skin graft done from the top of my scalp to the legs. Goodness ab entire scalp replacement? I am so sorry you have to deal with this I have only ever seen one other case gone this far and it makes me feel so much for the patient. My doc and I decided it best to reserve the accutane in case the current treatment does not help my case but I think it is the best option since all that is changed is the injections and topical stuff which probably does not work the way we hoped.  I am scared however because although the accutane has helped a number of people get rid of their bumps and even grow back their hair, I have seen some cases in which it has done nothing and I am terrified that it will not work for me. I really do miss my hair and seeing 2-5 strands come off everytime I wipe my hand across my wet hair in the shower really stresses me out.\nPerhaps I am ungrateful and hope you do not mind me asking but how do you get by without hair? Have you resorted to hats? I truly do not know how to deal like this in case it never comes back and I heard hair transplants do not work on these conditions. Honestly, I wear full lace hair pieces.. the most challenging part is working in an elementary school... basically, I cannot hide all my scars...  \n\nOver the years it has been a challenge to myself; mentally physically, and socially so metimes.. I lost my hair at 19, I had already had a full head of curls so adjustment to wigs was easy. but to say it has never bothered me emotionally I would be telling an untruth. Biology is such an unfair phenomenon. Nobody should ever have to deal with the consequences of Decalvans and Dissecting Cellulitis the way you and others have but because there is no cure and exact cause, everything is left to chance and trial and error. I have only been on this course for about 7 months now and have lost quite a bit of hair and grew back some but the stress and mood swings have destroyed what little bit of social energy I had left in me.

That may be what I just blame it on. Because there is not an exact cause, I am really hard on myself and in some way believe that I could have prevented it. I have no way to know if that is true.\n\nMy Belief in Effective Natural Treatments:\n\nWhile no cure has been officially found or clinically proven to me or my dermatologists' knowledge, it appears that in my case the biggest natural \"cure\" I have had was severely limiting my diet to raw foods. (Foods that basically do not have an ingredients list). Also cutting out dairy seemed to make a marked impact when I had severe acne, and also appears to be the case here.\n\n\\-----Changing diet\n\n\\-----TONS of water,  not way too much, but enough that your pee is almost always clear.\n\n\\-----Showering 2 or 3 x a week and removing the use of conditioner completely. I rarely use shampoo actually unless my hair is legitimately dirty (lots of particulates or dust etc)\n\n\\-----Changing my pillowcases every day or every two days.\n\n\\----Sleeping a full nights rest every night, with consistent times, perhaps more important and more oddly, sleeping exactly when you feel tired. \n\n\\-----Consuming probiotics/prebiotics pills\n\nMy Belief In Drug Treatments:\n\nIsotretinoin showed results for me, as did Bactrim, Doxycycline(for a while), and other antibiotics. My belief as to why antibiotics stop working eventually is because S. Aureus becomes resistant to each antibiotic as it is practically impossible to remove from your body as it is basically part of it. \n\nI just got off an 8 week course of clindamycin and rifampin (where I was probably 95-98% clear), but unfortunately i am relapsing but it is unclear why. Either way, I am glad to come across this community as no one other than my family really knows what I go through, but even though they know it is very difficult for them to understand.\n\nThis shit has made me lose a lot of sleep, happiness, and hair density. It is really made waking up everyday a fight to do simple things like go to work and school, and it makes it very hard to feel comfortable anywhere.\n\nAny thoughts? Thinking about picking this up ( \n\nand spraying it on my head. I also have keratosis pilaris, which comparatively does not affect my life as much, but could be a sign pointing to an imbalance of bacteria on my skin.  Hey, thanks for posting.\n\nHave you tried ClindaTech acne treatment topical solution?  It is clindamycin, but you apply it to the affected areas on your scalp.  I first discovered I had FD when a bald patch started forming and I was starting to get scarring and lose hair.  I was put on doxycycline for about a year, but once I came off, the FD came back with a vengeance and was resistant to it.  I had moved interstate by that time and so got a new dermatologist, who was shocked that I had been put on oral antibiotics as a first line of treatment.  She prescribed clindamycin topical treatment.  I was angry at her at the time for suggesting a topical treatment because I thought it would be ineffective and she was wasting my time and money.  Boy was I wrong.  For all practical purposes, it cured me.  As soon as I started using the ClindaTech topical treatment things cleared up, and after repeated use for a few months it cleared up entirely.  Then I only had to use it once every few months when a flare up happened.  Now the flare ups are so minor that I never use it anymore, I just wait for it to dissipate.  The pustules are small, and a bit sore, but never pussy or cause scarring anymore, and after a day or two they go away.  My hair grew back and I have no bald spots. \n\nI know everyone reacts differently to different medications, but the ClindaTech worked brilliantly in my case.  It is worth a try. \n\nI absolutely agree with you that stress and diet play a huge role.  I notice my flare ups, as minor as they are now, always occur when I am stressed, or when my immune system is compromised because I am sick or whatever.  I cut out gluten a while back and I am convinced that wheat and refined sugars cause flare ups for me.  Sounds like you are narrowing in on all the right areas, it is just a matter of trial and error from here to find the right combination that will make this thing manageable for you.\n\nGood luck.  One thing I would do is encourage you to check back in here and other forums, *especially if* you find a treatment that works and you no longer have to worry about FD, like I have.  When I first discovered I had it, I found only bad stories on the internet about people's experiences, and it was very frightening and disheartening for me.  The stress, apart from being not good for your general health, is particularly bad for FD.  Hearing some positive stories would have helped, but the reality is, people who have success are not likely to hang out on FD forums.  They just get on with their lives.   \n It would have made a difference to my mental health to find success stories like mine on there too, which is why I make a point of posting often. Haha nice. I was just talking about this yesterday with my mom and told her how discouraged I was feeling about it all, and she told me that I need to stay positive. I will ask my dermatologist about ClindaTech. I think he had just started mentioning to me that we try topical clindamycin. I actually was prescribed antibiotics as a first line of defense as well, but I wish I was not. I think it is not something the body wants dealt with by antibiotics. I have not though about cutting out gluten, but I will try it out! Have you ever been allergy tested? I was thinking about trying it. Also, how does dairy affect FD for you?  Have you noticed at all how alcohol affects you? Your case sounds the most similar to mine.\n\nIt is odd because I never knew myself to have food triggers before, but it really seems that a change of diet is the only thing that provides people relief, including myself. Thank you for reaching out to me, I will be sure to pay it forward. I wish I found this community a year ago. I believe for me it is something that changed with my immune system during freshman year, that is the only thing that makes sense.  Unfortunately, due to FD rarity and overuse of antibiotics finding a good derm was half the battle for me, and I finally feel like I found a decent one. Has the person who upvoted tried anything like this lol? Im concerned that it wont work as well once I showered, but I feel like my scalp sometimes feels gross if I do not shower for a day or two. I have not been allergy tested, no.  Actually, the biggest reason for my diet change has been other health issues.  I think I have been dealing with some kind of adrenal fatigue type thing, so that is basically driven me to cut out sugars, dairy, gluten, and alcohol altogether, unfortunately.  I have just noticed that since I have, it is also minimised my FD flare ups.  But it all seems interlinked...if I have an adrenal crash, my immune system goes to shit, and FD seems to like that and pops up to say hi.  Since I have cut out the gluten and sugar in particular, flare ups seem a lot rarer and a lot milder, though, and they seem to come back a little bit when I do eat those foods.  So I do think there is a relationship there.\n\nI am the same, I do not think I had any real food sensitivities until recently.  But, actually, thinking back, I was always tired and often felt slightly nauseous.  Now, when I am feeling good I feel really good.  I have energy all day and feel healthier than I ever have.  I think maybe I did have the sensitivities all along?  I am really not sure. I never bought in to the food sensitivities stuff in the past, I thought it was all a bit of rubbish...but I have kind of come around now!  I never thought I would be a no-gluten person haha.  I do not plan on being a no-beer person forever though! \n\nGood luck with the ClindaTech!  Hope it works for you, too.  It sounds like you have found a good derm who knows the right way to go with this.  Oral antibiotics is not a solution, it messes up your liver and FD seems to develop a resistance to them.  It also means if you have something else pop up down the track, you have less recourse to antibiotics to deal with it.  So once you get on top of this and find the right combination of lifestyle and medical treatments, you will be good! I have had it for 8 years and I am about to turn 22.\nBeen on antibiotica most of that and it started out as just a small bump in highschool. The condition actually burned itself out about 2 years ago but I still get spots every now and then. Finally stopped taking antibiotics, might have to start for a bit again? \nI would say the bright side is that it forced me to be healthier. Tried a better diet mostly to see if affected it at all but unsure how much it helps. As far as focusing, I get that. I used to go to the bathroom and just wash my head to fix the itch, or shower in mornings and nights. Otherwise, try wearing a beanie or a hat as a last resort, it does help but I understand. Benzol peroxide wash and T-gel were potentially helpful too, I used to switch between three shampoos as reccommended by my doctore. Eventually all this did help so know that at least it can get better. I am aure they tell you it can go as fast it comes. Thar was true for me though I did not believe it after like year six. Good luck to you and hope it goes away. That is how it started for me too. Switching between shampoos sounds like a good idea, lately I have not been using shampoo at all, because it seemed like it would help for a bit and then start making it worse. Is that why your doc recommended switching between 3? I hope you do not have to start the antibiotics, because imo it makes the problem worse when it comes back (sometimes you have to, just to get relief, I totally understand). Thank you friend. Any clues if it might be related to humidity or air quality? Seems unlikely, but my eczema seems to be worse when the air is not as great or humid (kind of like right now with all of the wildfires) I do not think so. I lived in Arizona and then moved to a more humid area a few years ago and it is been better. Sweating a lot never helped though so I could see it being unideal. It was a zinc, tar and some other type of shampoo. I cant remember the third one but I always used head and shoulders and t-gel which is pretty solid. Selson blue as well. Using the shampoo relieved my pain personally. Doc might have just ben hoping one worked lol. Luckily I think it will be a short time again. Slowly went from twice a day to only once to like once a week to none. If I take them I will only do every other day unless told otherwise. Keep us updated on anything you try. For sure, right now im trying a diet focused on: In case anyone is reading this that does not know where to start, I recommend implementing many of these changes regardless if you are taking antibiotics, isotretinoin, etc as they (probably consult with your doctor or derma, but they may tell you it does not matter)  do not hurt to try)\n\nFruits\n\nVegetables\n\nLean meat\n\nBeans, legumes, nuts\n\nSome gluten free grains.\n\nFor reference I am about 175 lbs with 24 bmi, \n\nExercise followed by a shower (along with all of the stuff mentioned before) at least once day.\n\nSunlight (shooting for 30 mins per day or so)\n\nCut out dairy, im toying with the idea of going vegan and gluten free to see what impact if any that has.\n\nAlcohol free for the time being.\n\nIbuprofen works really well for swelling but I read that it being a NSAID(non steroidal anti inflammatory drug) it can exacerbate the problem long-term, kind of like antibiotics. So instead I have been using turmeric and garlic as natural anti bacterial and anti-inflammatory. I know that I had to avoid tylenol as my body started to develop (my liver in particular) to isotretinoin and antibiotics that my AST and ALT levels started creeping up\n\nThe guy who created this site ( seemed to have a similar condition which started the same way went vegan and that helped him, could be meat, dairy, or some other sensitivity. I think dietary changes work because it shocks the body into resetting its physiology.\n\nHe mentions this shampoo ( it is currently sitting in my cart because its kind of expensive\n\nI have tried T-Gel, selsun blue, and t-gel. It seems that my scalp does its best when I use no shampoo(though I do not feel as \"clean\" admittedly) also my head stinks shortly after I shampoo sometimes, so it started to feel pointless lol\n\nAlso, have you ever tried probiotics? Ever since I got them, I seem to be doing better (not perfect, but better). I read some studies on lactobacillus and some other strains be particularly good for balancing gut bacteria.\n\nI am keeping a health journal to keep track of what changes have the biggest impact? Also, apparently the Japanese have been focused on osteopathic medicine for a lot longer than western medicine has, and as a result, their general acceptance of probiotics and the role the gut plays on our bodies is much, much higher in their society. They have a longer life expectancy than Americans, and I think that among other things may play a role. In case you want to try, here is the next probiotic I intend to try \n\n( it has a lot of strains, which most in stores do not have (3-5 vs 10-12)\n\nI think it is notable that the condition started for me when I was eating like shit, staying up late, drinking a lot, and wearing hats all the time  (from my bedhead) first semester of college. A lot of my friends did something similar, but everyone can get affected differently I suppose. Been a rollercoaster since. Eczema might be the cause. People with eczema are more prone to folliculitis. Researchers are working on a lotion that contains good bacteria to apply to the skin.  Thank you for this comment. This was not something I have really thought about but it makes sense. I am not saying the bumps on your head are eczema. They are folliculitis. Eczema type skin just creates the perfect storm for this condition - inflammation, weakened skin barrier, dysfunction in the antimicrobials contained within the skin. I have read that Accutane can increase staph aureus colonization, so you might want to ask your doctor about this before pursuing it. Stay up on eczema research. Until they can target the dysfunction in the skin to help us fight off infection, we will likely continue to deal with chronic infections. I wish you the best!  I think Mother Dirt products are a good idea to healthy skin, but I do not think the microbes they use will help combat the issue, but it does not hurt to try.  Your Mom is right, you have to stay positive. It is hard sometimes no doubt, but if you let it defeat your mind, it wins.  You relapsed after treatment because of dysfunction of the skin - my comment below. S. Aureus really gets into our skin. Researchers are working on combating their virulence factors - biofilms, quorum sensing, etc. rather than just try to kill them, because you cannot completely eradicate them. If you target their aggression rather than nuke them, they might play friendly again.  Your realization that antibiotic treatments can cause resistance is wise. The treatments aimed at the condition are a bit of a double-edged sword. They help but put the bacteria under pressure to adapt and survive. Educate yourself about the condition and bacteria. I am not against treatments at all, but we are playing chess here, so it is best to be educated about it. Your knowledge will be instrumental in working with your doctor.  I will say the holy grail would be to correct the skin, but that might take a long time if ever, though I am hopeful. Good bacteria lotion and ways to reduce inflammation and targets aimed at suppressing S. Aureus virulence factors are good bets too.  Just want to say I appreciate all the tips on here!

Im wondering why I do not just push for Humira and stop wasting time with the stuff that really is not working well. I took my first shot on Friday so about a week ago.

So I have been diagnosed with folliculitis decalvans a couple of months ago(mild,mostly tufted hairs). And after a couple of benzoylperoxide,triamcinolon and doxycycline uses my derm told me that my scalp is looking really healthy and prescribed me clobetasol. However When I move my hair I still feel like my hair is hurting( previously thought that it was my scalp but it is mostly the hair itself). Anybody know what is the deal with this and what medicine is recommended? Your scalp is most likely tender. I have had fd for 2 years. I am on oral doxycycline low dose(Oreca).\nAlso (cyclosporine) which I will stop soon.\nI also was given clobetsol solution drops. \nI would recommend picking up turmeric pills from cvs or any pharmacy. And take those, they help with inflammation. \nI also just told my doctor about clindamycin topical lotion. And she that is safe to be on and just prescribed it to me. I am glad your scalp is healthy. Mine is just red in the crown and has some inflammation and scarring. Luckily I have a small Afro so you cannot see anything unless you dig in my hair. But yeah Fd sucks , you have to control it so you do not lose your hair. Try not to stress and make sure you take your pills. Also like I said pick up tumeric pills, pick up some normal vitamins too. Maybe apple cider gummies. I am researching a lot for my self. I do not want to lose my hair lol. I do get cortisone shots every month to help with hair regrowth in some spots on my scalp. Lastly make sure you test your blood for allergies. I am gluten free because I am allergic to wheat. I also seen a lot of people with this had to go gluten free. Make sure your not eating anything your allergic too!!! That is a big part. Try to wash your sheets every week or 2 weeks. And I would recommend head and shoulders shampoo also. Good luck !! I am still trying to figure this out my self. I am 23 and when I first got this the first year I did not even know what I had. I was forgetting to take my pills and just thinking it would go away at some point. Now I know it is serious Hi, fellow sufferer here- i did not know that food allergies could exacerbate the condition\u2026 have you found some relief by eliminating wheat? I have seen on Reddit that people are saying it is a gut problem. So low sugar and gluten free diets. So I believe it is possible that it can help I have been gluten free for a while so I would not be able to tell you if it makes it better. But I will say make sure you check your blood for allergies and try to eliminate that Do you still experience some burning/ pain in the scalp while on doxy or did that resolve? Mine is pretty under control. So not really. My head will sometimes be a little sensitive/tender. But no burning. Whenever I work out I make sure I shower after so it does not irritate it. Make sure you talk to your derm about your body getting resistant to doxy. I believe mine did after a year. Then I got put on a low dose of doxy called oreaca that they said I would not get resistant too. And read the other comments too. You can take tuneric pills you can get from cvs. I take 2 a day along with the doxy 1 a day. I also take vitamins and zinc pills. I have drops that I put in every other day.", "Hypothyroid hair loss medication advice Hello all! Thanks so much in advance for reading my post or any advice, I am so desperate! &lt;3\n\nAs I am sure many of you can relate, I have been going through some pretty dark and difficult times with my scarring alopecia. I am struggling. It is very painful and seems to maybe be associated with some autoimmune issues, likely sub clinical hypothyroid. I am seeing a dermatologist and a rheumatologist next week (both second options), so I would just like to get an idea of my options before going into a usually rushed and stressful phone apt. (Thanks covid). I am very well researched, but I find research can only take you so far, and I trust my ladies and gents on Reddit for lived experience to supplement research. \n\nWith that said, does anyone have any opinions or advice about levo/synthroid vs naturally desiccated thyroid meds like armour ? I have heard people swear by both, and I am aware that very one is individual, but when it comes to hairloss specifically as a symptoms, where do you stand?

Hi, I am Tuey, and I am a 17 y/o female suffering from at the very least a case of 'regular' scalp folliculitis. This began occurring after I was on doxycycline 50 mg for acne for around 6 months.\n\nI did not develop pustules immediately. At first just sections of my head were extremely sore to the touch (and sometimes, I did not even have to touch my head to feel the pain). I had family look at it and they saw nothing. I was convinced it was either stress-related or neurological. My dermatologist said I had seborrheic dermatitis, prescribed a shampoo and steroid foam, and sent me out. The foam definitely works, but I do not like to use it too often. My most affected areas were my crown, nape, and temples.\n\nI developed red 'bumps' that I would poke with a needle and treat immediately. No puss came out of them, and they would usually dry up on their own. I would have one at a time. But as months passed, they became more frequent and also stuck around longer. I know a shampoo I used to use would really mess with it - perhaps that is why they took longer to heal? Just before I went back to my derm, I had a spot that absolutely would NOT heal. I am not sure if that was because the inflammation was so intense on its own, or if the shampoo caused it (Daddy-O from LUSH, if anyone's curious. Yeah, lots of violet fragrance.) Like I said, I went back to my derm, and she looked at my spots and said she would be putting me back on doxy (but 100 mg this time). What sort of ticked me off was the fact that she did not really...tell me what was wrong, just gave me the meds and a stronger steroid solution which I do not use. I had to SUGGEST if it was bacterial folliculitis. I also had to suggest that it was dermatitis back when she made that diagnosis.\n\nSo I am back on antibiotics for 6 weeks. No more pustules, but my head is sore as hell, mostly in my center crown area as well as the nape. I cannot tell if this is the dermatitis/eczema or follicular rash. Or if I even HAVE dermatitis, and it was the folliculitis all along. This all started back in November, by the way, right before Thanksgiving. I have not had any solace since then.\n\nI have been trying my best to do research on FD (as in, look up what is already published and been out there) to see if my case might be just that. As of right now I do not have any scarring (and I would not expect to since it is pretty early into the condition, if that is what I have). But do my symptoms/circumstance sound similar to any of your cases? Thank you so much for reading/responding if you decide to do so.\n\n----\n\nAnd since we are all sharing about ourselves in this great support community, I will share a bit about myself too:\n\nAs I said, I am a 17 year old girl from Pennsylvania. I am in my senior year of high school, and will be attending my city's university shortly after graduation. I am going for a bachelors in Biology, following a Pre-Med path, and will attend medical school. Eventually I would like to specialize in dermatology (something I fear I will not be able to do because of my own dermatological conditions). I am a digital artist and often draw in my free time. I also play the french horn (and a variety of other instruments) and participate in many different band performances my school decides to host or join. I am the drum major of my school's marching band, and the executive officer of our JROTC. I volunteer as a floor ambassador in the orthopedic surgery unit at my local hospital. As you can tell, I have a lot to distract me from my painful condition, but I also suffer from anxiety, BDD, and hypochondria which definitely does not help the situation. I realize that FD and other scarring alopecias, along with regular folliculitis and general scalp conditions are very hurtful to other people. If any of you would like to talk or vent, feel free to send me a message any time. As I mentioned before, I would like to be a dermatologist some day, and I would love to help anyone who is suffering from these conditions.\n\nThank you again for reading/responding!", "Hello :) Reporting in. Hello, thanks to decalvans for setting up this reddit.  I just got back from my dermatologist and it looks like I will be diagnosed with FD.  I am pretty sure at this stage that is what it is.\n\nMy story, basically ever since I can remember I have periodically had what I thought were just painful pimples pop up every now and then on the back of my head.  Every so often there would be one particularly nasty one in the crown area that would sometimes bleed or have puss but the others were always just sore bumps, never with puss or bleeding but sometimes tiny scabs.  Like I said, I assumed they were pimples, and I would usually just ride it out and they would clear up.\n\nThen recently they appeared again and like usual I thought nothing of it.  A big one came up in the same crown area and at some stage it burst and there was a bit of puss.  So I carried on and it seemed to clear up a little bit.  Then a few weeks ago a friend of mine pointed out a bald patch in the crown area, where the big 'pimple' had been and suggested I get it checked out.  A lump had formed with no hair.\n\nBasically I went to my GP and he said there were several others that looked similar on my head that showed signs of hair loss and I should see a dermatologist.  So it was then that I started thinking maybe they were not pimples at all.  I started researching and freaked out thinking I might have dissecting cellulitis of the scalp and the bumps seemed to be getting worse, much worse than they would ever been.  The appointment with the dermatologist was not for a few weeks, so I went back to the doctor and asked if I could be given some antibiotics.  He prescribed me a course of the antibiotic cephalexin?  Basically this seemed to help a great deal.  I just finished the last dose last Friday, it is Wednesday now, and *most* of the bumps died down but of course the bald lump did not.\n\nSo yes, today I saw the dermatologist and she said she thinks  I have FD and said there were a few other bumps showing signs of inflammation.  She took a bunch of biopsies.  The lump she thinks may be scar tissue, not a cyst, because when she put the needle in it did not ooze and there seemed to be nothing inside.  I do not know if that is a good thing or a bad thing.\n\nSo it looks like I am in for the long haul now.  I suspect I have probably had this for a long, long, time but for some reason it has now chosen to get worse.  Does it usually get worse with age?  I basically started researching when I got home and have resigned myself to dealing with it as a lifestyle thing.  I would be lying if I said I was not worried about losing my hair or being disfigured, but I will take it as it comes.\n\nA little bit about me, I am 33, I like writing music, play a few instruments, and I work as a court transcript typist.  I just graduated (late in life I know) with a degree in Philosophy and I was accepted in to a Masters of Research postgraduate course working in cognitive science and philosophy at my alma mater.  I deferred that until next year, this year I am studying a teaching degree so I have a backup job if the academia/research thing does not pan out :)  Now I am a little worried that if my FD gets too bad I will not have the guts to get in to a classroom!  Kids can be brutal! hehe.\n\nSo again, thanks for starting this thread and posting your stories, and special thanks to alpthrow for posting that zip file of the research articles.  Much appreciated.\n\n*Update* Just got a call from the dermatologist and she confirmed a diagnosis of folliculitus decalvans and has prescribed me a three month course of doxycycline.", "Decalvans / Sodium Hypochlorite?

(in quarantine)  It may be folliculitus decalvans, it looks similar to the balding I had when it came on.\n\nTry and get a phone consultation with a good dermotologist if you can and ask to try topical treatments like clindamycin.  It helped alleviate the condition for me and my hair grew back on the bald spots.\n\nTry not to freak out, while FD is incurable, the damage is not necessarily permanent, but you need to get a proper diagnosis and start looking seriously at some treatment, including possibly diet changes (diet exacerbates my FD)...be careful of oral antibiotics, they are a stop-gap solution that will cause you more damage in the long-run, in my experience. Looks like ring worm What medicaition would you say helped the most The clindamycin topical treatment all but cured my FD.  I only get very minor flare ups now, no hair loss, no open sores, and I do not even have to apply the clindamycin anymore.\n\nIt was pretty much a miracle treatment for me. How were you diagnosed did you get a biopsy ? Yeah I did, the original derm diagnosed me and put me on Doxycycline for a year and a half which destroyed my gut microbiota I am going to ask for a biopsy I took dox for a month which did not help My advice based on my own experience is to avoid oral antibiotics.  My doctors think it caused some serious damage.  I had to have a fecal microbiota transplant done recently and have developed what we think is an auto immune condition which the damage also certainly contributed to.\n\nGet diagnosed and ask to try topical antibiotics first.  And experiment with diet, particular one aimed at reducing inflammation. Appreciate the help thanks That is how my alopecia ophiasis always starts out. I have had it for 37 years"]
